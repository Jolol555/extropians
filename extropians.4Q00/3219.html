<em>&gt; Hardly!  Do you have any idea how hard it is to bring one's self to

commit
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, and the more cowardly the suicidal self, the more difficult it is to
<br>
commit the final act.
<br>
Cowardice keeps millions of depressed and despairing people alive.
<br>
Nevertheless, if you haven't considered suicide, you haven't matured much.
<br>
If you have never considered suicide, you don't understand the human
<br>
condition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think that there is anyone harder to kill than one's own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self.
</em><br>
<p>In addition, there is no one harder to defeat than one's own self, which
<br>
has decided on suicide. Who will defend the self against the suicidal
<br>
self?
<br>
Try to remember, there are two sides to every suicide: The murderer and
<br>
the victim.
<br>
<em>&gt;From the murderer's side, suicide is cowardly, because the victim has no
</em><br>
defense.
<br>
<em>&gt;From the victim's side, suicide is heroic and tragic, because the whole
</em><br>
world ends for the victim.
<br>
Obviously this all occurs in one brain, but it is a schizophrenic, divided
<br>
brain that intends to kill itself out of despair. Suicide is always a
<br>
question of illness: Either the brain itself is ill, or it is living in
<br>
illness, for example cancer or social catastrophe.
<br>
<p>Does suicide require courage from a person who is going to die a painful
<br>
death by cancer? Just take some pills and say bye-bye. Was it courage or
<br>
cowardice that prompted Hitler to kill himself? Much depends on time and
<br>
circumstance.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry for nirvana,
<br>
