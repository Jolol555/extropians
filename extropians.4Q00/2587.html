To answer your queries, briefly:
<br>
I am guessing that a intellect fried on booze still produces more 
<br>
intellectual  property, then one fried on sweet sensamilla. However that is 
<br>
debatable. It also makes me think of a middle aged man still narfing down of 
<br>
maui wowee seem incongruent to me
<br>
<p>SDI bought us little, but it helped collapse the Soviet economy. If one 
<br>
believes that their mentality was mired in Stalinism (as it was) then it was 
<br>
still worth it, by far.
<br>
One area under development was the free electron lasers used by TRW and some 
<br>
Israeli scientists to shoot down those short range katyuska rockets. We shall 
<br>
see if this research is as good as it has been pimped by the DoD.
<br>
Another more fertile area might be using star wars free-electron and eximer 
<br>
lasers to instantly to vaporize water into hydrogen and oxygen for fuel 
<br>
cells. Also fuel cell research has advanced a bit, with capacitors and  such.
<br>
<p>Toughness matters only in the perception of people who desire to be your 
<br>
enemy. With some people (peoples) passivity has mean weakness, and weakness 
<br>
must be exploited. Its a values and perception mentality.
<br>
<p>What you stated in your thread, reminded me of what the late Futurist, Herman 
<br>
Kahn, had to say. He said he was a social -democrat pacifist untill WW2. He 
<br>
noticed that the Germans had the best generals, the best trained troops, the 
<br>
most modern equipment, and until 1941, were winning all the battles. His 
<br>
point was that fear makes warriors of us all. One is forced to make choices.

<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;...
<br>
<em> &gt; He was brilliant as a inspirer and sharer of scientific knowledege. He was 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; also big time into the Ganja and this at age 55-60!  ...
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;So what?  I hope that members of this list are smart enough not to buy
<br>
&nbsp;the ridiculous lies of entities like the U.S. drug warriors and others
<br>
&nbsp;for whom mere marijuana consumption is some kind of moral taint.
<br>
&nbsp;Especially given that many on this list openly enjoy the far more
<br>
&nbsp;dangerous drug alcohol for conviviality.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; ... He was a big time 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; schmuckeroo when it came time to face down the Soviets, when they wished 
</em><br>
to 
<br>
<em> &gt; Glom West Asia and Western Europe--and glom it they would have, had not 
</em><br>
the 
<br>
<em> &gt; West and Old Man Reagan showed them a fist, and the will to use it. Carl 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Sagan  was chicken ala Carl on the money for SDI, and basically viewed the 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; world so pessimistically, that surrender was better then
</em><br>
<em> &gt; annihilation ...
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;So you're basically saying he wasn't macho enough for you?  Please
<br>
&nbsp;spare me.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;I for one am no enthusiast of an imperial US power and support the
<br>
&nbsp;libertarian position of ending the income tax.  It's kind of hard to
<br>
&nbsp;do that while trying to establish imperial peace around the globe.  I
<br>
&nbsp;think a US that looks after the bare minimum of its self defense is
<br>
&nbsp;ultimately in the world's best interest, and immediately in its own
<br>
&nbsp;national interest, and I have no enthusiasm for my government's
<br>
&nbsp;playing world's policeman.  While this may not be official list
<br>
&nbsp;politics anymore, there are many similarly minded people here, still,
<br>
&nbsp;I hope.  I, too, would have counselled caution and parsimony in
<br>
&nbsp;experimental military expenditures, and allow me to ask this: what did
<br>
&nbsp;the SDI money buy us?  When did the benchmark for sensible policy on
<br>
&nbsp;science and technology become &quot;how tough are you?&quot; as opposed to
<br>
&nbsp;showing results?  I'd rather be right than tough every time.
