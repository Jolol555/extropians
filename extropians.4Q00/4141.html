Title
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhancement of hippocampal neurogenesis by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lithium.
<br>
Source
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Journal of Neurochemistry.  75(4):1729-34, 2000 Oct.

Abstract
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing evidence suggests that mood disorders are associated with a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reduction in regional CNS volume and neuronal and glial cell atrophy or loss.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lithium, a mainstay in the treatment of mood disorders, has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;recently been demonstrated to robustly increase the levels of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cytoprotective B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (bcl-2) in areas of rodent brain and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in cultured cells. In view of bcl-2's antiapoptotic and neurotrophic effects,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the present study was undertaken to determine if lithium
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;affects neurogenesis in the adult rodent hippocampus. Mice
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;were chronically treated with lithium, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling of dividing cells was conducted over
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;12 days. Immunohistochemical analysis was undertaken 1 day after the last
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;injection, and three-dimensional stereological cell counting revealed that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lithium produced a significant 25% increase in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus. Double-labeling immunofluorescence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;studies were undertaken to co-localize BrdU-positive cells with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;neuron-specific nuclear protein and showed that approximately 65% of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cells were double-labeled. These results add to the growing body of evidence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;suggesting that mood stabilizers and antidepressants exert neurotrophic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;effects and may therefore be of use in the long-term treatment of other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;neuropsychiatric disorders.
