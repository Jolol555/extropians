Robin forwards,
<br>
<em>&gt;From: Alex Tabarrok &lt;<a href="mailto:ATabarrok@independent.org?Subject=Re:%20Buchanan%20Palm%20Beach%20Statistics&In-Reply-To=&lt;200011140059.QAA08024@finney.org&gt;">ATabarrok@independent.org</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of the studies on the web page I noted this is by far the best and most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comprehensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://elections.fas.harvard.edu/">http://elections.fas.harvard.edu/</a>
</em><br>
<p>This did seem to be a good analysis from what I could tell.  It found
<br>
that you could pretty well predict the Buchanan vote in a county based
<br>
on the Bush and Nader vote percentages, and West Palm Beach was an
<br>
extreme anomaly.
<br>
<p>I was trying to think of a way to apply fair-division theory to these
<br>
kinds of disputes.  You know, the old &quot;I cut and you choose&quot; method
<br>
of dividing a birthday cake.  You have this sort of strategic space
<br>
in which the two sides can make moves, and each wants to maximize his
<br>
chances of winning, just like with the cake each wants to maximize the
<br>
size of his piece.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately it doesn't work because at some point you need to say
<br>
something like, Bush, would you be satisfied with the outcome if we
<br>
assigned all the Gore votes to you, and all of your votes to Gore?
<br>
That way you could get each guy to agree to a policy which gave each
<br>
side a fair shot.
<br>
<p>But this is obviously ludicrous in the context of an election where
<br>
people are expressing their preferences.  Fairness is not the same as
<br>
equal division, it's just that in this case, with the vote so close,
<br>
it looks somewhat similar.
<br>
