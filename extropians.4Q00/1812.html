<em>&gt; Now, corn, up until 500 years ago was completely unknown to anyone but Native

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Only sweet corn, which is grown for human consumption, has enough sugar to
<br>
be sweet to the taste. Field corn, from which animal feeds, corn syrup, and
<br>
almost all other corn products are derived, is very starchy and not very
<br>
sweet. Rice, wheat, and barley are also &quot;atom bombs&quot; of starches. What makes
<br>
them so great and corn so evil?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Why do you say that? As far as I can tell, corn, barley, and rice are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strikingly similar, nutrionally. For example, see:
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where then is the wheat, rice, and barley syrup?
</em><br>
<p>All of those exist, they're just much more expensive to produce than corn
<br>
syrup.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Corn is higher in sugar (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notice the page you referenced does not break down the carbohydrates at all),
</em><br>
<p>No, it's not. Corn syrup isn't produced by tapping cornstalks and ears and
<br>
boiling the sap. It's produced by chemically converting the starches to
<br>
sugars, a process known as refining. For more information, see:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.corn.org">http://www.corn.org</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and is also very low in thiamin, niacin, and calcium compared to the others,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though it is well endowed with Vitamin A. The sugar is the big thing, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cornfed cows are sugar junkies, this I know from experience, since if given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity they will prefer cereal surplus even over well fermented silage (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apple jacks and other cinnamon cereals do tend to pass the cinnamon through to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the milk, though).
</em><br>
<p>Cereal is sweetened. You can't blame that on the corn.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not for me. I want my meat from lean athletic animals that work for a living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and work out all day). Fish swim all day, grouse, woodcock, duck, geese, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wild turkey all scratch out their living in the wild, deer get chased around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty thoroughly by dogs, coyotes, cars, and any odd sound that sets them into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hysterics, while moose are constantly working the swamp wading treadmill, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caribou are the long distance kings. 
</em><br>
<p>That's fine. You're welcome to eat whatever kind of meat you like. Most
<br>
people would probably find it tough and oddly flavored. It's probably
<br>
healthier than grain-finished beef. It seems to me, though, that the health
<br>
benefits are due primarily to the lower fat content.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You may have hormone and chemical free cattle, but unless they walk at least a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few miles a day and live off the land, I'm not interested.
</em><br>
<p>You misunderstand. My beef is not for sale. I understand and agree with your
<br>
desire for hormone and chemical free meat, but I'm not as convinced of the
<br>
need for them to live off the land and walk N miles per/day. (My cattle walk
<br>
quite a bit, but I've never attached bovine pedometers to them to see
<br>
exactly how far they go.) I like my beef fairly lean, too, but I like a
<br>
tender steak now and then, and I like the way grain-finished beef tastes. If
<br>
I was willing to give all that up for the health benefits, I'd give up beef
<br>
altogether.
