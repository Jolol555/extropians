<em>&gt; &quot;Spike Jones&quot; wrote&gt; What if the murder's *victim* received cryonic suspension?

</em><br>
<p>Altho no one should ever undergo cryonic suspension *against* their
<br>
will, in the case of a murder victim who never heard of the technique,
<br>
I would favor suspending the victim.  My reasoning is this: I suspect
<br>
that when we freeze the piece of meat that is running one's mental
<br>
programs, that piece of meat will never be successfully thawed.
<br>
However, that piece of meat may eventually be raised to perhaps
<br>
-5C and read by nanobots into some sort of machine that will
<br>
simulate that program.  It seems to me that under those circs,
<br>
we could figure out a way to control the pain.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, it *is* a hell of a good question, however.  There are
<br>
certain types of pain that will be difficult or perhaps impossible to
<br>
control.  If I reanimate, I already know the very first thing I will do:
<br>
I will sit down and weep: for all the people that I have ever loved
<br>
and cared about, most of them will be lost forever.  The heartache
<br>
that I will feel on that day is *nearly* enough to convince me that
<br>
I do not *want* to face it, even if I get eternal existence in return.
<br>
But I think that it will probably be a good trade-off, and so would
<br>
favor suspending a person whose will is unknown.
<br>
<p>As it turns out, that was one of my biggest problems when I was
<br>
still a believer in Religion Inc: that waking up in heaven would be
<br>
the saddest experience imaginable, because of those who were
<br>
not there.  Cryonic reanimation will likely be just as bad, if not
<br>
worse, for there are damn few cryonauts, far too few, and of
<br>
course I think the world of you who are, I hope we will be best
<br>
of friends, but honestly, you will never replace my grandfather,
<br>
and he is gone forever.
<br>
<p>So, JR, do the murder victims get suspended against their will?  No.
<br>
<p>Do they get suspended if their will is unknown?  Yes.
<br>
<p>Should murderers get the chance to have cryonic suspension, even
<br>
if their victims are lost forever?  I think they should, yes.  I am a
<br>
reluctant proponent of capital punishment, but I do not propose
<br>
we deny the recipient last rites by the clergy of their choice, nor
<br>
do I propose denying them suspension if they want it.  Certainly
<br>
I do not propose suspending the prisoner against the prisoner's will.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, I suspect that the first successful cryonic reanimation
<br>
would be on an executed prisoner, for there you would have a
<br>
unique example of a corpsicle that was likely young and healthy
<br>
when she underwent the suspension, perhaps making the brain
<br>
configuration easier to read.   What say ye?  spike
