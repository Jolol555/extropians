<em>&gt; Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if you could remove &quot;the bad part&quot; the entire other person was
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  But killing the killer will not bring that person back.  It will
<br>
only result in another individual irretrievably lost.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How could a sentient, caring person live with themself knowing they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had murdered another person? Denial? That wasn't the &quot;real&quot; me?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>A sentient, caring person can come to appreciate the enormity of the
<br>
wrongness of the act if properly reformed and never perform such an act
<br>
again.  Many acts short of murder but also quite heinous cannot be
<br>
undone.  At best one can make what poor atonement one can and resolve
<br>
never to perform in such a way again.  Or do you believe all wrong-doers
<br>
should be executed given your logic?
<br>
<p>How can a sentient, caring person condemn another human being to
<br>
irreversible and irretrievable death?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; This could also lead to a dilemma: What if someone decided to kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone knowing the worst that could happen is that the &quot;bad part&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be purged. They would still accomplish their task.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is not that simple by far.  There is no &quot;bad part&quot;.  This is a
<br>
strawman.  Their task was a misaligned way of acheiving some goal.  Cure
<br>
the misalignment if you can.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Of course one would like to think if we had the kind of technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that could remove &quot;the bad part&quot; this would be accomplished before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Most likely many such murders would be avoided by better psychological
<br>
and sociological practices before the fact.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Axiology: The branch of philosophy dealing with values, as those of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics, aesthetics, or religion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Cute, but hopefully incorrect as we very much require ethics especially
<br>
as we become more powerful.
