Forgive my ignorance on this matter but why can't centrifugal  force be used
<br>
as substitute ?

Subject: Solutions to the Zero-G problem
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Everyone here knows that the biggest problem for long term space travel,
</em><br>
at
<br>
<em>&gt; least in our current biological state, is that the body begins to undergo
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; type of &quot;space rot&quot; in zero gravity, the muscles atrophy, the bones
</em><br>
weaken,
<br>
<em>&gt; etc. This is most frequently mentioned as a serious barrier to a manned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mission to Mars. On the ISS, astronauts will get two hours of excercise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today. On Mir, and any shuttle mission, physical excercise is always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practiced, and the astronauts are still phased when they return to Earth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These are missions of less then a year - missions in weightlessness
</em><br>
lasting
<br>
<em>&gt; decades would probably kill us upon returning to a gravity environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There needs to be some way to have the muscles in constant excercise, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are here on Earth resisting gravity. Someone mentioned the idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tethers, and correctly added that they will clutter up the craft. Here are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some possible solutions I've thought of. Feel free to build on and
</em><br>
implement
<br>
<em>&gt; them. I'll start with the worst ideas and move up. I'm sure science
</em><br>
fiction
<br>
<em>&gt; authors have beaten me to most of these.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Have a constant downward air flow. Basically, the astronauts would live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a wind tunnel pushing them into the ground. They would need to
</em><br>
excercise
<br>
<em>&gt; muscle power to stand against it. It would probably take a lot of power,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be noisy, and would require specialized ships (would not be
</em><br>
portable),
<br>
<em>&gt; and it would be impossible to read a newspaper. Also, they would probably
</em><br>
go
<br>
<em>&gt; deaf very quickly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Have the ship filled with water, or some more viscous fluid. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astronauts would face some resistance just trying to get around because
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; would need to fight against the water. A downward flow, as in idea number
</em><br>
1,
<br>
<em>&gt; would assist too and give a direction to the artificial gravity. Drawbacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are that it would weigh the ship down a lot, and that they would need some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to breath, perhaps by suits or, in 25 years or so, by respiocytes
</em><br>
which
<br>
<em>&gt; can leave their body to interface with the water and drawing out oxygen.
</em><br>
The
<br>
<em>&gt; computer equipment would need to be water proof. A benefit is that the
</em><br>
water
<br>
<em>&gt; could be drunk, and broken down by solar powered electrolysis to use for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuel, and it would provide some protection against radiation. It would
</em><br>
need
<br>
<em>&gt; to be constantly cleaned, would require special ships, and is not
</em><br>
portable.
<br>
<em>&gt; Respiocyte reference:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Gallery/Species/Respirocytes.html">http://foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Gallery/Species/Respirocytes.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. Replace the force of gravity with the magnetic force. This was my first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea: somehow have the astronauts body have metal in/on it, either by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attachments to his body (no more complicated then jewelry) or implanted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him. Possibly, devise some molecule which has an impermeable bio-friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; core, and is full of metal on the inside. Then megnetize the floor. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem is that the megnetic force is very strong close up and very week
</em><br>
far
<br>
<em>&gt; away. His feet would feel the effects but his head would still be in
</em><br>
zero-G,
<br>
<em>&gt; unless he fell down. The effects would be no different then having a
</em><br>
sticky
<br>
<em>&gt; floor. Then I came up with the idea of having it so that the astronaut has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small electromagnets all over his body, and the floor is metal. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electomagnets would be able to sense how far they are from the floor, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adjust their magnetism to approximate the effects of gravity. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electromagnet on the soul of his foot knows it's less then a centimeter
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; the metal floor, so it is completely off. The one on top of his head knows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's far away so it would be on maximum power. If he falls over, each
</em><br>
magnet
<br>
<em>&gt; on/in his body senses the approaching ground and adjusts its strength
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accordingly. The problems with this are that there would have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extensive testing to find out the effects of having a super-powered magnet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right next to your brain 24 hours a day - maybe there already is data on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, but I don't think it would be good for you. Also, I don't know if
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; electromagnets can be that strong and that powerful at the same time. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equipment may get heavy. The ships would have to be somewhat specialized:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they could have no metal parts except for the strip on the floor. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer equipment in the ship would need to be adapted to be resistant to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the constant magnetic fields, hard disks at least would have to go and
</em><br>
some
<br>
<em>&gt; slower alternative would have to be used.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. The best one I've thought of is completely portable and do-able within
</em><br>
5
<br>
<em>&gt; years. There is a &quot;smart material&quot; called electroactive polymer. It has
</em><br>
been
<br>
<em>&gt; proposed as an artificial muscle for robots or even artificial muscle for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans. It bends, in a muscle-like way, in response to a voltage applied
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; it. So my idea is, build a suit embedded with this stuff and have it react
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to your movements in such a way as to approximate the effects of gravity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When you lift up your arms, it senses the movement away from the ground,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; applies a slight and calculated resistance, trying to pull your arms back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down. This (and number 3) could be turned off with the flip of a switch in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an emergency situation. When it's on, it might take some getting used to.
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; would think your movements would be kind of jerky, and until it's tested I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't know how long it would take to get used to it, if ever. This one
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; completely portable and could be used on today's space shuttle. Another
</em><br>
good
<br>
<em>&gt; thing about it is that it would have a direction of gravity, but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction would not have to be the floor, it would just be whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction your feet happen to be facing, and you could still float. Here
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; a reference to the electroactivated polymer material:
