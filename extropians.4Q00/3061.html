<em>&gt; The central question here is: will people retain love? I think rather

</em><br>
<p>Uh-oh, the clear light of neuroscience has come to reveal a glimpse of
<br>
verisimilitude here. Yep, I can see the borgs now, they're producing
<br>
surges of activity in their anterior cingulate cortexes, middle insulas
<br>
and in parts of their putamen and caudate nuclei -- all generated by their
<br>
Palm GX-9000 with Sensoria VR auxilliary customizations. Ah... ain't love
<br>
grand?
<br>
&quot;Pass the bong,&quot; one of them murmurs.

<p><em>&gt;We still
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; high symbolic and social significance (&quot;dinner&quot;), and I doubt a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posthuman would make itself unable to enjoy a meal even if it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powered in other ways. Radical technology doesn't seem to imply that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we *remove* much of our current selves, but that we extend them in new
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, sure. I mean that's what *I* use porn for. Marriage doesn't need to
<br>
enter into it. (Okay, I admit I've had a few extended conversations with
<br>
the checker at Blockbuster, but hey, we'll get over it without a nuptial
<br>
entanglement... please!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for that the social forms these basic feelings take, that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another matter. Marriage is just one possibility. I have faith in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (post)human creativity to come up with many more.
</em><br>
<p>Holy sheep dip! I'm glad to hear you say that. Those of us who wish to,
<br>
can continue to enjoy wedded bliss while inventing a future that provides
<br>
possibilities that only a borg can fully comprehend and appreciate. I
<br>
think we've pretty much worked ourselves out of this box. Borgs can
<br>
provide social relationships to order. End of story.
<br>
<p>No kidding,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than loved for what you are not&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Out beyond ideas of wrong doing and right doing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is a field. I'll meet you there.&quot;    -RUMI-
