Yes, on that note, I suggest you get in touch with WAS, Inc (www.was-inc.com).
<br>
They are an ecommerce fulfillment house that uses Datamann software in the
<br>
background, and they have developed the new ecommerce web interface for
<br>
Datamann. They are in California, so you folks out there should be able to get
<br>
in touch with them easily. Les Kooyman is the guy to talk to there that knows
<br>
me. They can handle the credit card processing for memebrships, and help ExI and
<br>
the Extropic Art Center set up a shopping cart for, what else, &quot;t-shirts and
<br>
coffee mugs... &quot; ;-).
