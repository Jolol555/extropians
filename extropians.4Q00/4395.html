While enduring a conference call this morning, I was surfing on
<br>
Goggle under the search &quot;Al Gore and the Internet&quot; and came upon
<br>
this document (it was about 9 down).
<br>
<p>I am deeply suspicious about their reasons for doing it, clearly
<br>
they are operating at the 8th (political) layer of the OSI model,
<br>
and I would bet 100 bucks who they voted for, but as propaganda
<br>
goes it's the very best. No advocate of the opposing position
<br>
should be without it. Nothing quite like an &quot;Argument from
<br>
Authority.&quot;
<br>
<p>I stand by my earlier analysis and opinion.

<p>Dave and Declan,
<br>
<p>I am taking the liberty of sending to you both a brief summary of
<br>
Al Gore's Internet involvement, prepared by Bob Kahn and me. As you
<br>
know, there have been a seemingly unending series of jokes chiding
<br>
the vice president for his assertion that he &quot;took the initiative
<br>
in creating the Internet.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bob and I believe that the vice president deserves significant
<br>
credit for his early recognition of the importance of what has
<br>
become the Internet.
<br>
<p>I thought you might find this short summary of sufficient interest
<br>
to share it with Politech and the IP lists, respectively.
<br>
<p>==============================================================
<br>
<p>Al Gore and the Internet
<br>
<p>By Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf
<br>
<p>Al Gore was the first political leader to recognize the importance
<br>
of the Internet and to promote and support its development.
<br>
<p>No one person or even small group of persons exclusively &quot;invented&quot;
<br>
the Internet. It is the result of many years of ongoing
<br>
collaboration among people in government and the university
<br>
community.  But as the two people who designed the basic
<br>
architecture and the core protocols that make the
<br>
Internet work, we would like to acknowledge VP Gore's contributions
<br>
as a Congressman, Senator and as Vice President.  No other elected
<br>
official, to our knowledge, has made a greater contribution over a
<br>
longer period of time.
<br>
<p>Last year the Vice President made a straightforward statement on
<br>
his role. He said: &quot;During my service in the United States Congress
<br>
I took the initiative in creating the Internet.&quot;  We don't think,
<br>
as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he
<br>
&quot;invented&quot; the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our
<br>
minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a
<br>
significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving
<br>
Internet. The fact of the matter is that Gore was talking about and
<br>
promoting the Internet long before most people were listening.  We
<br>
feel it is timely to offer our perspective.
<br>
<p>As far back as the 1970s Congressman Gore promoted the idea of high
<br>
speed telecommunications as an engine for both economic growth and
<br>
the improvement of our educational system. He was the first elected
<br>
official to grasp the potential of computer communications to have
<br>
a broader impact than just improving the conduct of science and
<br>
scholarship. Though easily forgotten, now, at the time this was an
<br>
unproven and controversial concept. Our work on the Internet
<br>
started in 1973 and was based on even earlier work that took place
<br>
in the mid-late 1960s. But the Internet, as we know it today, was
<br>
not deployed until 1983. When the Internet was still in the early
<br>
stages of its deployment, Congressman Gore provided intellectual
<br>
leadership by helping create the vision of the potential benefits
<br>
of high speed computing and communication.  As an example, he
<br>
sponsored hearings on how advanced technologies might be put to use
<br>
in areas like coordinating the response of government agencies to
<br>
natural disasters and other crises.
<br>
<p>As a Senator in the 1980s Gore urged government agencies to
<br>
consolidate what at the time were several dozen different and
<br>
unconnected networks into an &quot;Interagency Network.&quot; Working in a
<br>
bi-partisan manner with officials in Ronald Reagan and George
<br>
Bush's administrations, Gore secured the passage of the High
<br>
Performance Computing and Communications Act in
<br>
1991.  This &quot;Gore Act&quot; supported the National Research and
<br>
Education Network (NREN) initiative that became one of the major
<br>
vehicles for the spread of the Internet beyond the field of
<br>
computer science.
<br>
<p>As Vice President Gore promoted building the Internet both up and
<br>
out, as well as releasing the Internet from the control of the
<br>
government agencies that spawned it.  He served as the major
<br>
administration proponent for continued investment in advanced
<br>
computing and networking and private sector initiatives such as Net
<br>
Day. He was and is a strong proponent of extending access to the
<br>
network to schools and libraries. Today, approximately 95% of our
<br>
nation's schools are on the Internet. Gore provided much-needed
<br>
political support for the speedy privatization of the Internet when
<br>
the time arrived for it to become a commercially-driven operation.
<br>
<p>There are many factors that have contributed to the Internet's
<br>
rapid growth since the later 1980s, not the least of which has been
<br>
political support for its privatization and continued support for
<br>
research in advanced networking technology.  No one in public life
<br>
has been more intellectually engaged in helping to create the
<br>
climate for a thriving Internet than the Vice President.  Gore has
<br>
been a clear champion of this effort, both in the councils of
<br>
government and with the public at large.
<br>
<p>The Vice President deserves credit for his early recognition of the
<br>
value of high speed computing and communication and for his
<br>
long-term and consistent articulation of the potential value of the
<br>
Internet to American citizens and industry and, indeed, to the rest
<br>
of the world.
