<p>Thank's for corroborating my story. I was a phone man at the
<br>
Chicago based world headquarters for awhile. I liked them alot, but
<br>
it was a very intense corporate culture.
<br>
<p>You can imagine why I like GATTACA.
<br>
<p>There is a whole subculture of such people here in downtown
<br>
Chicago. They've taken it to interesting heights. It's very common
<br>
for example to only date people within certain area codes. I had a
<br>
good laugh a few years back when we split up their beloved 312.
<br>
<p>I used to date a GATT and saw alot of unusual practices. Another
<br>
example, my former girlfriend and many of her friends didn't bother
<br>
taking birth control pills, they had undergone tubal ligation
<br>
surgery instead. They used to have conversations about whether or
<br>
not a guy was worth getting &quot;untied&quot; for...
<br>
<p>Interesting.
