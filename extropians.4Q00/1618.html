<p>Alcohol (methanol and ethanol) is used in race engines. It runs great, but 
<br>
is can be difficult to start in cold weather. &quot;Gasohol&quot; is a mix of 
<br>
gasoline and alcohol - up to 10% normally, ethanol. Methanol, I believe, is 
<br>
more corrosive than ethanol, and both alcohols will make certain plastic 
<br>
and rubber parts in older cars deteriorate. To use it as a motor fuel would 
<br>
require some additives to improve starting and minimize corrosion, just 
<br>
like additives in gasoline tailor octane rating and help prevent formation 
<br>
of deposits in the fuel system.
<br>
<p>Methanol can be made from methane, either fossil natural gas or gas from 
<br>
composting organic matter.
<br>
<p>Alcohol made from corn (ethanol) is pushed by the farmers and greenies, but 
<br>
I do not think it would be cost-competitive with gasoline. Of course, 
<br>
gasoline is presently price-supported in the US, so any comparisons would 
<br>
be warped. It does have the advantage of being biomass, so it does not add 
<br>
to the CO2 burden like fossil fuels. I have heard that the costs of raising 
<br>
enough corn to produce a gallon of alcohol exceed the value of the alcohol 
<br>
as fuel. One item I read had just the fuel burned by the farmer's tractor 
<br>
being more than the heating value of the alcohol. If this is true, biomass 
<br>
alcohol is nothing more than another price support for farmers.
<br>
<p>Alcohol has less heating value per unit weight than gasoline, so mileage 
<br>
for a pure alcohol powered vehicle will be less than for gasoline.
<br>
<p>Any combustion engine has pollutants in its' exhaust. A well tuned piston 
<br>
engine with a properly fitted catalyst can be close to &quot;zero&quot; pollution, 
<br>
but never quite gets there. Alcohol burns somewhat cleaner than gasoline, 
<br>
so that should reduce unburned hydrocarbons. Gas turbines and external 
<br>
combustion (steam) engines are less polluting than piston engines since 
<br>
they are continuous combustion, which can be more easily regulated. Any 
<br>
power source that uses a hydrocarbon, including fuel cells, will emit CO2, 
<br>
and the greenies want that classed as a pollutant, too. Only pure hydrogen 
<br>
(at present) burned so as not to produce any oxides of nitrogen, can be 
<br>
considered totally pollution free. Since high efficiency engines want as 
<br>
high an input temperature as possible, NOx emissions are always a 
<br>
consideration.
<br>
<p>Any flammable liquid that can be fed through a fuel injector can be burned 
<br>
in an internal combustion engine. Diesel engines have been modified to run 
<br>
on corn oil, used frying oil, liquefied coal, etc. Whether one wants to, 
<br>
given the pollution, and inherent inefficiency of an IC engine, is another 
<br>
thing. I think advances in fuel cell technology will soon make fuel cells 
<br>
more attractive than IC engines for many automotive applications.
<br>
<p>I don't think we will see an end to IC engines anytime soon, as they are 
<br>
just too simple and relatively cost effective in too many applications.
