<p>
It's not so much that I want to acknowledge the possibility of imaginary
<br>
things existing, but to simply note the fact that if a matter/energy complex
<br>
is in a causal relationship with me, it quite obviously exists.
<br>
<p>On looking at what I wrote, I see the word &quot;potentially&quot; is somewhat
<br>
redundant. I use it to underscore the fact  that the definition includes
<br>
matter/energy complexes that are not in any kind of causal relationship with
<br>
me now, (for example the hypothetical electrons carrying the hypothetical
<br>
thoughts in the hypothetical &quot;brains&quot; of the  hypothetical crystal beings of
<br>
Antares 3) but that COULD enter into a causal relationship with me in the
<br>
future (by building hypothetical spaceships, hypothetically invading earth,
<br>
and hypothetically enslaving me in their hypothetical neutron mines, for
<br>
example. :))
<br>
<p>Conversely, as concerns a matter energy complex that has NO potential to
<br>
share a causal chain with me, I do not feel I can say that it exists in any
<br>
reasonable sense of the word. Existence, for me, implies at least the
<br>
potential for interaction. If no such potential is present, the two
<br>
complexes do not mutually exist.
<br>
<p>Scerir: Yes. That is exactly what I mean. Unidirectional observation is the
<br>
most non-interfering form of sharing a causal chain. When I observe a thing,
<br>
changes happen in my brain. Those changes are in response to a pattern of
<br>
photons hitting my eyes, which may be doing so in response to physical
<br>
effects impacting some sort of sensor, which are caused by those physical
<br>
effects interacting with the thing I am observing. There is a causal chain
<br>
that leads from their atoms to my visual cortex.
<br>
<p>Even if i am not percieving a thing right now, there is a certain class of
<br>
things that I could percieve in the future (the aforementioned aliens) and a
<br>
class of things I could not (a square circle, or other similarly logically
<br>
impossible oxymorons). The former, I feel, can be said to exist. The latter
<br>
do not.
<br>
<p>J.R. Molloy: this definition is designed, while not eliminating metaphysical
<br>
speculation out-of-hand, to firmly ground said speculation in a decidedly
<br>
materialistic and scientific model of human perception. (I.E. Angels may
<br>
exist, but if we can see them it is because they are either creating photons
<br>
in the outside world or twiddling neurons in my visual cortex.) Does that
<br>
help?

<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; My personal definition of existence is &quot;all complexes of matter/energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; their direct analogues) that could potentially exist in a causal chain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; me.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I like that definition, except for the word &quot;potentially&quot; -- that opens
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the possibility of imaginary elements in existence (not part of reality).
