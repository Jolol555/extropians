</em><br>
<p>Of course. And, as many have pointed out here already, the very idea of a 
<br>
Dyson sphere is a bit passe. I was working on the problem more out of 
<br>
curiosity than anything else. Some of my other friends have already taken 
<br>
me to task for preferring inherent stability to a maintained dynamic 
<br>
stability, but I just don't find something that has to be tweaked 
<br>
constantly as elegant as something that just works because its the right 
<br>
shape.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You could place a lot of rings on the inside of the sphere, like baby
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ringworlds. Mount them like ferris-wheels on the inner surface, slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misaligned so that the inner surface of each ring receives some light -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just the part closest to the &quot;ground&quot; (inner dyson sphere surface. Then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spin all the rings. The inner surface of each ring receives light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes, and is dark sometimes.
</em><br>
<p>Then why bother building the sphere? Why not just have a collection of 
<br>
spinning rings?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The upshot of this would be that the dyson sphere would be stable on two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; axes, but still unstable along its rotational axis. Its not a total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; solution, but it does make the problem more managable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Put a spinning dyson sphere inside a larger, spinning ring. They share a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; center, and the outer ring passes over the two rotational poles of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inner spinning sphere. Use something to attract the dyson sphere outward to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ring at the poles, or maybe all the way around. Maybe magnetism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Somebody creative could suggest something.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe a lot of outer rings (3 place orthogonally to each other, plus more?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plus some attractive mechanism, could be used to stabilise the otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unstable sphere?
</em><br>
<p>The orbital mechanics for this start to get REAL messy, and pass beyond 
<br>
what I can solve with my limited understanding.
