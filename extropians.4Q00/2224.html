<p>
These problems illustrate that vote counting, like any other measurement
<br>
process, has a certain amount of inherent uncertainty.
<br>
<p>Naively we would suppose that the question of which candidate a certain
<br>
ballot indicates is a question with a certain answer.  In fact though
<br>
there is always a probabilistic element.  In well designed ballots the
<br>
vast majority will have a clean answer.  But in any system there will
<br>
be a gray area.
<br>
<p>Some fraction of the ballots will be ambiguous to some degree or another.
<br>
Your counting system will have to draw a conceptual line to separate
<br>
the ballots that can be counted for one or another candidate from those
<br>
which can't.  And the location of this line will be arbitrary.
<br>
<p>Several years ago I reported on a local election which would tip the
<br>
balance on the local board of county supervisors.  It was extremely close
<br>
and went through several recounts, getting a different winner each time.
<br>
In the end a judge had to manually inspect dozens of partially spoiled
<br>
ballots and try to ascertain the likely intention of the voters.
<br>
This eventually decided the election.
<br>
<p>The Florida count currently separates the candidates by less than .005%.
<br>
Their votes are the same to four significant figures.  Measuring any
<br>
physical phenomenon reliably to five significant figures is a challenge.
<br>
It is no wonder that there is uncertainty in the ballot counts.
