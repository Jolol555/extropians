<p><em>&gt;T.S. Eliot, &quot;Death by Water&quot; in &quot;The Waste Land&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>According to my uncorrected 1987 proof copy of the Macmillan edition, this
<br>
sad tale is drawn from Eliot's famous poem `The Waste Lane'. Prior to the
<br>
invention of sewers, such lanes were found behind every row of town houses,
<br>
for the ease of handling indecorous materials out of view of those who
<br>
fancied T. S. Eliot's work.

<p><em>&gt;Phlebas the Phoencian, a fortnight dead [...]
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;    		Gentile or Jew
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Remeber Phlebas, who was once as handsome and tall as you.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it's all about that little-known citizen of Phoence, Remeber Phlebas.
<br>
Poor Remeber was a shapeshifter but once forgot his mother's warning and
<br>
made a horrid face while the wind changed, and so was stuck looking like
<br>
Marty Feldman. 
<br>
<p>Scholars originally speculated** that the working title must have been
<br>
`Consider Phlebitis', since like Oedipus, Remeber suffered from leg
<br>
problems. (Everyone else had three, he was stuck with two.) Later it was
<br>
decided that I. M. Banks, a notorious punster, was actually inviting a
<br>
creative misreading: `Consider Fleabites',*** a reference simultaneously to
<br>
James Joyce's celebrated `agenbite of inwit' (the pangs of gnawing
<br>
conscience) and the agonies suffered by any traveler in a strange and
<br>
inhospitable land, especially a stranger with one leg shorter than the other.
