You know, I'm beginning to wonder if you're reading anything I'm writing. (I'm
<br>
also wondering if this isn't a waste, really. No one else is responding, either
<br>
to tell me I'm full of it, or explain anything. I don't want to just waste
<br>
resources, so if no one else is interested, I'd say we just let it drop.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've yet to say I agree with any of these ideas I'm talking about (and, in
<br>
fact, have said I don't) and yet you're responding as if I am promoting them. To
<br>
be clear, I'm doing 2 things.
<br>
1) I have been a libertarian for a number of years (12, or so) but lately have
<br>
begun to see some ideas as flawed. I'm trying to see if I can work them out, on
<br>
a list where I know the people are intelligent and engaged. If what I say is
<br>
interesting, they'll respond. Extropianism is not, as some assert,
<br>
transhumanism+libertarianism, but a large number of extropians are also
<br>
libertarians, and so the ideas seem to suit either one.
<br>
2) My actual degree is in Journalism, with a Public Relations emphasis. If, as I
<br>
think, I want people to see extropianism as it is, to listen, to pay attention,
<br>
and to either let people do as they wish or even support them, I have to get
<br>
them to listen. They won't do that now, and I am wondering how to get them to.
<br>
I'm making observations based on my own thinking and experiences I've had.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm hoping you realize I'm not 'flaming' you, but am using your responses
<br>
(so far, you've been about it) to make some points, and respond to others.

<p><p><em>&gt;From: Samantha Atkins &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20Random%20comments%20on%20some%20late%20discussions.,&In-Reply-To=&lt;852569AF.005E353E.00@notes.cbis.com&gt;">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hmm. So you are all for actual major government nastiness if the money extorted
</em><br>
or whatever goes to fund what you care &gt;most about?  How far does that go?  Are
<br>
you willing to see people robbed, beaten, even killed to fund this stuff?  Do
<br>
the &gt;ends utterly justify the means in your mind?
<br>
<p><p>You are personally defining someone's rights (or accepting someone else's
<br>
definitions) and then holding people to them. What about all those people who
<br>
disagree with your ideas of rights, their sources and derivations, your logical
<br>
structure? If you want to be allowed to make your own mind up, why deny someone
<br>
else the same? By defining the terms of the debate (what a right is, how logic
<br>
works, etc.) you really stop any debate. Yes, there have to be rules or chaos
<br>
results. But, you're (in effect) saying thousands of years of mainstream
<br>
philosophy, theology (natural rights are derived from religion, despite
<br>
assertions otherwise), etc. I might agree, but, again, I'm used to being in a
<br>
minority position.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No.  I am not forcing anyone to do anything  but leave me alone.  All  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ask for is a negative, the absence of  coercion.  If you want to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really twisted I guess you can say I am denying someone's right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;murder, plunder and enslave me.  But to say that would assume there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such a thing as some right to do these things.  I don't care what people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agree with. I care whether or not they live with me and one another in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remotely civilized manner.
</em><br>
<p>THIS may be the clearest example yet of what I mean. YOU are deciding how the
<br>
debate goes, on what terms, what has relevance, etc. That is just not how it
<br>
goes. There are a whole lot of people whose emotions are part of their
<br>
reasoning, and you do have to deal with those people. Like sucks that way, but
<br>
it's reality.
<br>
<em>&gt;Your emotions are irrelevant.  Give me your reasoning.
</em><br>
<p>On this, I agree completely. However, what you don't seem to get is my point
<br>
about it. We won't ever get to minimalist government the way we're going. We
<br>
can't convince enough people to do so, and on this we DO need a majority. That's
<br>
just the way it works.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a very relevant point here. I first learned about the Libertarian
<br>
philosophy/party listening to Norma Jean Almodovar (I know I've spelled that
<br>
wrong) being interviewed. She took questions from callers, and the one that
<br>
sticks in my mind was the guy who told her Libertarianism 'was fine for those of
<br>
you with 130 IQs, but what about the rest of us? We need someone to take care of
<br>
us.' I am NOT making that up. The problem is that you assume your experience is
<br>
all there is, that no one could possibly think coercion is good. You are wrong,
<br>
I think history backs me up on this. Now, how do we deal with them? They do
<br>
still vote, and wield political power.
<br>
<em>&gt;  But if you can have the system be truly minimalist giving the people that do
</em><br>
see what needs doing the maximum freedom &gt;to proceed without coercion or
<br>
coercing others, then that is probably the best that can be achieved.  Even
<br>
relatively stupid &gt;people can see it is in their interest not to be coerced and
<br>
can even see what types of systems tend to produce the most &gt;goodies.
<br>
<p><p>Again, you're deciding beforehand what 'counts' and what doesn't and then
<br>
telling people they're wrong because they don't agree with you. Who decides
<br>
what's rational? On what basis? What's objective? What's reasonable?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep trying to say, if people value things other than individual freedom
<br>
as their primary value, what you're doing will turn them off. They then go about
<br>
their lives, letting the statists get their way (since they espouse the same
<br>
values, and haven't already prejudiced them by pissing them off) and we lose. I
<br>
have a problem with that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Right, according to whom? I keep trying to make the point that people are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; operating from libertarian values, theory, etc. and then violating them. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; simply do not think libertarian theory is right, they don't value what we do.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;According to an objective view of what rights do and do not consist of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Which is the only thing that could possibly support any position on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human ethics.  If they think differently then lets compare the quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if the thinking, the reasoning and philosophy and its results (if any)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and decide which appears more reasonable.  Once again, truth is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matter of opinion.  Some values are mostly opinion at the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt;primitive state of our philosophies and knowledge.  But what is needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for humans to flourish is not arbitrary or infinitely malleable.  Truth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is not democratically arrived at.
</em><br>
<p><p>HOW??? That is exactly what I'm trying to figure out here. Telling me all I need
<br>
to do is build a rocket to get to the moon doesn't mean it's going to happen. I
<br>
have to know how. How are we going to minimize government, given that we're a
<br>
minority? How do we become a majority? How do we get what we need, even if we're
<br>
not a majority?
<br>
<em>&gt;Then your only logical alternative is to do your best to minimize government
</em><br>
coercion across the board so they don't stop &gt;those technologies from being
<br>
developed.
