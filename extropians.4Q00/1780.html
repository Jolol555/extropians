<em>&gt;I don't think this is quite the right question to ask, in terms of

</em><br>
<em>&gt;giving up something today for a benefit ten years ago that I might not

</em><br>
<em>&gt;I might not remember a specific day ten years ago, but I would remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the overall tone of my life in those days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The real question is, it seems to me, is would I have been happier over

<em>&gt;the course of my life if I had generally saved more for the future ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is what their remedy would do.  It would coerce or persuade me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to delay present pleasures into the future.  Their claim is that most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people would be happier, in general, if this were done to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My answer to the question in this form is, no, ...  this will come
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at a constant, gnawing cost, of giving up the pleasures which make life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so enjoyable.  ...  A life of deferred gratification is a life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of sacrifice and frustration.  I believe that if we fully internalize and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand that cost, that we will come to understand that past pleasures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are very worthwhile, even when we have forgotten the specific details.
</em><br>
<p>The question I asked is exactly the right question to ask given the
<br>
formulation in the paper.  If you reject that formulation, then if you
<br>
want to play the formal policy analysis game you are implicitly challenged
<br>
to come up with an alternative formulation which supports the alternative
<br>
conclusions you favor.  Of course you could just reject this challenge,
<br>
and just declare that your wholistic intuitions tell you true that the
<br>
right sort of analysis would vindicate the conclusions you favor, and if
<br>
detailed analyses disagrees with that they must have the wrong details.
<br>
But then it would be hard to have much of a disciplined discussion with you.
<br>
<p>I can't really make much sense of the extra costs of sacrifice and
<br>
frustration you speak of.  But perhaps you could formalize it if you tried.
