<p><em>&gt;I thought iron atoms were mainly used by blood cells- by what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chemical process would they contribute to free radical formation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in normal body cells?
</em><br>
<p>Indeed iron is an essential component of hemoglobin, which when
<br>
incorporated inside red blood cells is esential.
<br>
<p>The problem as I understood it is that EXCESS iron in the blood
<br>
reeks havoc. (oxidation) In the book &quot;RealAge&quot; I mentioned a few
<br>
days ago, the doctor mentions a case where a young (24) man is
<br>
brought in in terrible shape, and experiencing life threatening
<br>
heart problems. The young man only months before was benching 360
<br>
and now was in terrible health.
<br>
<p>A through history by the doctor revealed he was taking 10 grams of
<br>
iron a day as a supplement, it almost killed him. Fortunately after
<br>
treatment to remove the excess iron he made a complete recovery.
<br>
<p>I don't have the book handy today but maybe a search on RealAge.com
<br>
would bring up the relevant papers.
<br>
<p>Several health books I've read recently have pointed out that men
<br>
get more than enough iron in their diet, and that any
<br>
supplementation is detrimental rather than helpfull.
