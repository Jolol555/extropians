<p>&quot;Disciple of Another Sect&quot;
<br>
(c)2000 by Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.
<br>
<p><p><p>I stood at the altar, as he stood at the doorway, my students spread
<br>
between us like lines of magnetic force.  I'd been expecting this, but
<br>
that didn't make it any less saddening, or frightening.  One year ago,
<br>
he'd been trying for the same style he affected now; black clothes, black
<br>
headband, black fingernail polish, ice-blue contact lenses, and a spiked
<br>
metal earring.  The clothes were still black, but they were real leather,
<br>
professionally tailored, dyed so black that he moved like a hole cut out
<br>
of the world.  One year ago he'd been another pretentious novice.  One
<br>
year ago he'd been my friend.
<br>
<p>&quot;Jonathan,&quot; he said, nodding graciously.  &quot;Still searching for power, I
<br>
see?&quot;
<br>
<p>I didn't want to do this, I didn't want to do this...  &quot;I've found power,
<br>
Berel.  I continue along the path.  I can't do the things you can, but
<br>
what I can do is real.&quot;
<br>
<p>In answer, he lifted his hands toward me, spread his fingers.  Lightning
<br>
crackled along them.  It was a simple trick, the hands of his new body
<br>
lined with conductive fibers... but it was the dream, the unspoken
<br>
childish fantasy that had brought my students here.  &quot;Show me your power,&quot;
<br>
he said.
<br>
<p>I swept my hands to indicate the whole room.  &quot;You can see the ritual that
<br>
is performed in this place, the power that is being summoned,&quot; I said
<br>
quietly.  &quot;You were of us, once, and you may watch if you wish.&quot;  It was a
<br>
straight line for his next attack, and I knew it.  I needed some Zen sting
<br>
to put him in his place, some clever defense to win back the minds of the
<br>
watchers...
<br>
<p>&quot;Raising power,&quot; he said.  &quot;I was here for that, Jonathan.  I remember.  I
<br>
remember that I felt empowered afterward.  I don't remember a demon
<br>
tearing through the walls of reality.  Show me something obvious,
<br>
Jonathan.  Show me something that even I can't rationalize away.&quot;
<br>
<p>It was a tiny opening, but I drove at it.  &quot;You can rationalize anything
<br>
away if you wish, Berel, like all the others -&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Rationalize this!&quot; he shouted, and a cold wind began to blow from him,
<br>
slowly at first, then rising to gale force as he rose into the air. 
<br>
Ballast, I thought, stored under high pressure to add weight to a body
<br>
that was naturally lighter-than-air, then released from pressure and
<br>
allowed to flow outwards.  Change the volume of a gas and the temperature
<br>
changes with it.  He had transformed himself into a floating
<br>
air-conditioner...  I clung to the humor of the thought.  He could defeat
<br>
himself with these party tricks, if enough of my students saw through
<br>
them, if enough of them had the education, but those students were more
<br>
vulnerable to him in other ways.  For a moment I regretted encouraging
<br>
them to study the sciences, but then angrily rejected the thought.  Magic
<br>
was real, as was science, and I was a seeker of truth, not a con man.  I
<br>
would die before I believed otherwise.
<br>
<p>His arms were spread from his body, his legs crossed at the ankles, toes
<br>
pointed downward, as he floated like a crucified devil.  &quot;Nobody can
<br>
rationalize this,&quot; he said.  &quot;Nobody can say it's not real.  Did you ever
<br>
wonder if maybe there is real magic in the world, Jonathan, and you don't
<br>
have it?  If that's why you can't levitate a pencil or predict a coinflip,
<br>
after all these years?  If maybe all the talk about patience and
<br>
immaterial forces are no true part of magic, while the students of some
<br>
other discipline transform wood into iron after their first year?  It's
<br>
what you'd expect, after all.  It's what's described in all the books. 
<br>
The sorcerers you told me about didn't tell themselves how empowered they
<br>
felt, they conjured demons!&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The one thing I am certain of,&quot; I said, staring into his unreal eyes, &quot;is
<br>
that if there is real magic in the world, you do not have it.  Your tricks
<br>
are not an answer to that, and you know it.&quot;
<br>
<p>His hands collapsed to his side.  His feet dropped to the ground.  &quot;There
<br>
is no magic in this world, Jonathan,&quot; he said.  &quot;And I don't need to dream
<br>
about power when I have the reality.&quot;  He turned, walked out the room. 
<br>
Three of my students stood up, walked after him.  The others stared at me,
<br>
at the door, looking lost, or cheated.
<br>
<p>&quot;Nanotechnology has no soul, Berel!&quot; I shouted after him.
<br>
<p>His voice floated back.  &quot;It works.&quot;
