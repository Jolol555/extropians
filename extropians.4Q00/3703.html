<p>
Extropes,
<br>
<p>I ran across the across the following article, so forwarding it here.
<br>
I don't know if this article or topic came up before on this list.
<br>
<p>I didn't know that Dyson was religious. I wonder if he was just
<br>
saying some of these things to not offend the givers of this prize?

<br>
<p>&quot;Dyson Gets Religion Prize&quot;
<br>
<p><p>by Toni Feder

<br>
May 2000

<br>
<p>&quot;It's a bit crazy -- I'm doing my best to make sense of it,&quot; says
<br>
Freeman Dyson, on winning this year's Templeton Prize for Progress in
<br>
Religion. It's the second year running that a physicist has won the
<br>
prize, which is awarded annually to a `living individual for
<br>
outstanding originality in advancing the world's understanding of God
<br>
or spirituality.' Founded in 1972 by global investor John Templeton the
<br>
prize always outstrips the Nobels financially; this year it's worth
<br>
$948,000.
<br>
<p>Now an emeritus professor at Princeton's Institute for Advanced
<br>
Studies, Dyson is perhaps best known to physicists for synthesizing
<br>
into quantum electrodynamics the seemingly conflicting theories of
<br>
Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. He's gained
<br>
a wider audience among the lay public with his books, beginning in
<br>
1979 with _Disturbing the Universe_. His writings, he notes, &quot;have
<br>
quite a lot to do with ethics, and to some extent with religion as
<br>
well.&quot;
<br>
<p>The thical issues that most concern Dyson are: getting rid of nuclear
<br>
weapons -- &quot;still the most important, but sadly neglected&quot;; making the
<br>
Internet accessible to all; and exploiting biotechnology.
<br>
<p>In his latest book, _The Sun, the Genome and the Internet_, Dyson
<br>
argues that instead of widening the gap between the rich and the poor,
<br>
science and technology should be used to close it. Biotechnology &quot;will
<br>
have enormous power, to cure diseases, for example. But it can be
<br>
abused in all sorts of ways. We have to watch out. It's extremely
<br>
important to make medical advances available to everybody,&quot; says
<br>
Dyson. &quot;Technology must be guided and driven by ethics if it is to do
<br>
more than provide new toys for the rich. It's a question of social
<br>
justice.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Social justice is something religious people care about,&quot; he
<br>
continues. &quot;A lot of scientists care about it too. So they might get
<br>
together and do something about it.&quot; Science and religion are two
<br>
windows that look out on the same universe, say Dyson. &quot;There is no
<br>
incompatibility. As a scientist, I live with uncertainty all the
<br>
time. As a religious person, also. Neither my science nor my religion
<br>
is dogmatic.&quot;
<br>
<p>Unusually for a scientist of his stature, the highest degree Dyson
<br>
holds -- not counting more than a dozen honorary doctorates -- is a
<br>
bachelor's, from the University of Cambridge. &quot;The PhD is generally a
<br>
tremendous waste of time. I'd like ot abolish it,&quot; he says, adding
<br>
that earning a PhD is worst for people who leave academia. &quot;It's using
<br>
up the best years of their lives, so they are middle aged before they
<br>
can do anything. I have six kids, and I'm very plesed that there's not
<br>
a PhD among them.&quot;
<br>
<p>As for winning a prize for &quot;progress in religion,&quot; says Dyson, &quot;To me,
<br>
progress in religion means that religion should become more of a force
<br>
for good -- and not a force for evil. In history, it's been both.&quot;
