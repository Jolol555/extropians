</em><br>
<p>We are talking about a period well after economic growth and
<br>
technologicalprogress has stopped getting faster and is getting slower and
<br>
slower.  Nearing
<br>
the limits of what is physically possible.
<br>
<p>We are also talking about adaptation to a very stable and dumb environment.
<br>
Selection for adaptability makes sense when your environment changes often
<br>
and when it consists largely of other adapted creatures (e.g., red queen
<br>
effect).
<br>
The leading edge of a colonization wave just has to deal with variations in the
<br>
density of dead stuff in its way.  Other than that the environment is very
<br>
stable.
<br>
<p>If seeds are large enough, then they may contain lots of extra genome for
<br>
adaptability with little extra cost.  But if seeds are small, then expensive
<br>
adaptability features like sexual reproduction and a memory of human desires
<br>
may be selected out.
