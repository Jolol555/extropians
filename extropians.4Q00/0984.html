<em>&gt; I appreciate your enthusiasm as shown in your participation on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropians List. However, I'm getting complaints from a number of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about excessive posting from a few individuals, you being among them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hal Finney -- the person who has expressed this feeling on the list, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the only person -- suggested a sensible guideline: No more than six
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posts per day. That makes it more likely that each one will be thoughtful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It will also reduce the traffic jam that threatens to induce people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave the List in frustration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd appreciate you keeping your posting volume down to that level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Max
</em><br>
<p>Okey-dokey artichokey.
<br>
How sad we have so many whiners and complainers on a list that supposedly
<br>
supports high technology. Can't these crybabies figure out how to use a delete
<br>
button or an e-mail filter? Oh, well. I guess that just goes to prove that
<br>
opposites attract: entropic nudges are attracted to extropic glitter.
<br>
Just to be on the safe side, I've decided to post no more than 5 (count 'em,
<br>
five) messages to the list per day. (This is the third one today -- but I've
<br>
received 55 messages from the list.) If we find anyone else breaking the volume
<br>
barrier, we'll just send extra copies of your recommendation to them, all right?
<br>
<p>Here's a sample of today's Extropy list mail with some playful remarks.

<br>
<em>&gt; My mom loves me more today for it -- she's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finally grown up a buit herself -  but I moved out for the first time at 16.
</em><br>
<p>Well, now isn't that special. Perhaps someday you'll grow up a buit yourself.
<br>
Better watch out though. The cops go looking for teenage runaways.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;This appears to be a web page for a commercial outfit looking to get into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the whole body transplant biz. Kind of a wide-open market, I would think. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might be in the market a few decades from now...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Haven't had time to look at this link, but will do so later
</em><br>
<p>Better hurry before they run out of heads to transplant onto your body.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt; humans will probably always create some sort of transcendental belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system. The communists and nazis were atheists but in effect created their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own belief system or religion that they were willing to die for.
</em><br>
<p>Wrong. Nazis were supported by the Catholic church, which is somewhat theistic.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm very close to being bi-polar between ENFP and ENTP myself.
</em><br>
<p>Don't worry too much about it. Someday soon they'll have medication for that.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;The future waits for the problem-solvers
</em><br>
<p>No it does not. The future waits for no one. It often steam-rollers failed
<br>
problem solvers.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;The heat is on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's make or break time for the dream of never-ending fusion power
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, the heat is on. Some call it &quot;global warming&quot; which comes from the
<br>
almost never-ending fusion power of the Sun.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;I'm sure there is a market for nukes which must be used while still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fresh. Stockpile stewardship people certainly get paid to think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this.
</em><br>
<p>Uncle Sam has nukes so fresh you have to slap them. Neutron bombs are no myth.
<br>
Too bad we don't get paid to post about these things, huh?
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;Moral: The technology better be flawless before people hop on the ride. But I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guess that was true of the first Roller-Coaster?
</em><br>
<p>Probably not. That's what makes it so thrilling. There's always the chance the
<br>
roller-coaster will crash and break all the bones in your body. Ya gotta die
<br>
sometime. Might as well go out screamin'
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;I am fully aware of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;process by which we are being stripped of all rights, not just guns. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Million Moms &quot;grassroots&quot; movement is a prime example.
</em><br>
<p>Stop that trolling! Just because America is ruled by Momism is no reason to say
<br>
so.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;What would you say punishment is for? Your use of  &quot;punishment &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gives the impression of &quot;retaliation&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Retaliation should ideally be punishing, but punishment is often unconscious
<br>
enough to deny it has anything to do with retaliation. For example, silly people
<br>
may punish us with their idiocy, but not in a retaliatory fashion.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;   The death penalty is the only just punishment for the crime of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murder. (IMO)
</em><br>
<p>That's probably what some murderers think when they kill someone. Gang members
<br>
often resort to execution as a means of settling scores.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;I doubt it would be worthwhile making a bomb with an element heavier than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plutonium, pre-detonation would be a real problem so you couldn't make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very powerful bomb, and it would be as expensive as hell.
</em><br>
<p>Why make hell cheap?
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  My current hypothesis for what is causing the Flynn effect is based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the kind of sexual selection
</em><br>
<p>Fat chance! The Flynn effect (basically, everyone's IQ is rising) owes most to
<br>
the fact that teachers are teaching the test, and students cheat more now than
<br>
they ever have before.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;I never do anything about amassing money, but as a worker I think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what kind of work I can do to contribute to the positive direction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;global networking.
</em><br>
<p>Good thinking! There's way too many people contributing to the *negative&quot;
<br>
direction of global networking.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;Do extropians indulge their carnal desires to any extent?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Without staining their souls?
</em><br>
<p>Holy smoke! What a profound couple of questions. It must be difficult to indulge
<br>
carnal desires without staining something... even if it's only the bed sheets.
<br>
But since souls don't exist, no doubt extropes can do it without imaginary
<br>
stains.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
&quot;Immortality: My long life ambition&quot;
<br>
<p>If it's only a &quot;long life&quot; ambition, then it sure ain't gonna result in
<br>
immortality, sweetheart.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;The idea isn't to alter gender but to render it unimportant; as unimportant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as the color of one's eyes.
</em><br>
<p>Oh yeah, that's sure to happen.
<br>
And why stop there? Make the species unimportant as well. What the hell, make
<br>
animate objects unimportant. There's an idea for you: Start marketing &quot;sex
<br>
rocks&quot; for people to whom organic or inorganic is as unimportant as the color of
<br>
one's eyes. (Don't forget, age should be as unimportant as the color of one's
<br>
eyes. So sex with six-year-olds is also OK)
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;-- even asked what the hooks in the bedroom ceiling were for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --as if she could not guess. I finally just gave up and left everything out.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you left out the explanation for what the hooks are for.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;Once virtual immortalism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;achieved somehow, the you will get a test of existentialism.
</em><br>
<p>No kidding? You mean to say that when people can live forever they're still
<br>
going to be immured by the sophism of Jean-Paul Sartre? Think again.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;Even better, we should see how we can polish up transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking in order not to fall into the traps he describes.
</em><br>
<p>Better yet, we should breed AIs that can do that for us. No sense wasting time
<br>
on those who have obviously chosen to stay behind when technological singularity
<br>
emerges.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;These polls never work. The E's shout out &quot;I'm an E!&quot; And the I's just sit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there muttering, &quot;No freaking kidding.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>No we don't. We sit there muttering, &quot;Who freaking cares&quot;
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;The idea that some will go on towards Singularity (or whatever) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the rest will remain, is of course one of the main Scary Arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Against the Singularity
</em><br>
<p>It's that &quot;or whatever&quot; that seems to argue rather poignantly against the idea
<br>
that humans will ever live up to the fantasies that science has allowed them to
<br>
entertain.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;how candidates do in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a debate, if new scandals about candidates surface, how the media spins each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;candidate to the public, as well as world events and economic trends. Dealing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with this is very much like Hari Seldon's Science of Psychohistory
</em><br>
<p>Hari Seldon, the man who laid the framework for the universe that came to be
<br>
known as the Foundation (Asimov's trilogy), indeed did a better job of it than
<br>
any real live human.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;Certainly, minors reading Extropians are a positive force in society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Therefore, I'm saying we should help Johnny keep his secrets.
</em><br>
<p>Don't ask, don't tell Johnny's secrets.
<br>
(I won't tell, if you don't tell.)

<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;J R's message seems to be intentionally baiting, but I'll give it a go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyway.
</em><br>
<p>The only &quot;baiting&quot; going on here is the mental master-baiting you're doing.
<br>
<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;If anyone retitled this discussion as &quot;Is online pornography a positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;force in society?&quot;, I'd have no objection - it looks like a clean subject line
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to me.
</em><br>
<p>And if the answer turns out to be &quot;yes&quot; then we should not hesitate to use
<br>
sexually explicit language in the subject line.

<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;Until we have better tools, let's be considerate of what we do have an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think about mailboxes overfull with posts from the same people.
</em><br>
<p>It sounds like you haven't learned how to use the filter feature of your e-mail
<br>
program...
<br>
no need to wait for better tools, just learn to use the ones you already have.

<p>somebody else wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;We punish a perpetrator for his crime in order to educate or change him and

</em><br>
<p>For perpetrating the crime of sexism (calling the perp &quot;he&quot;) I sentence you to
<br>
five minutes of having your head removed from your rectum.
<br>
<p>Well kids, that's all for now.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
