Hal Finney asked,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you would not pay $2.60 to give your ten year ago self $1, isn't this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent to saying that you regret that you didn't save $1 ten years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago so that you could have $2.60 today?
</em><br>
<p>No, it is not equivalent because a ten year ago self could purchase something
<br>
that could appreciate in value. A ten year ago self could buy a tool with which
<br>
to make something, build something, create something. That ten year ago $1.00
<br>
tool could produce much more value than $2.60 could buy today. Extropy abides by
<br>
expansion in more directions than wise investment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And if this is the case for most people, doesn't it imply in effect that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of us regret most of the consumption we have done in the past?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so. If we (&quot;most of us&quot;) had most of the money (compounded
<br>
quarterly) that we (&quot;most people&quot;) ever spent on consumables, we'd all be dead.
<br>
Rich maybe, but dead to the experience of life, dead to the extropic potential
<br>
of every fleeting moment. What kind of tight-assed totalitarian economy wants to
<br>
stop the consumption we have done in the past? I should complain because I don't
<br>
have fifty grand a year to retire on? I've already outlived 85% of the people on
<br>
the planet. How greedy would I have to become to outdo the other 15%?
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.

<p>You know why there's a Second Amendment? In case the government fails to follow
<br>
the first one.
<br>
-- Rush Limbaugh, in a moment of unaccustomed profundity 17 Aug 1993
<br>
[From the Eric Raymond file]
<br>
In case you've forgotten the First:
<br>
AMENDMENT I
<br>
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
<br>
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of
<br>
the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the
<br>
government for a redress of grievances.
