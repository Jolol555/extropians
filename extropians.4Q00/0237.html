<em>&gt; &gt;about the level of health on this list.  How often do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;members get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;check ups?  have their blood tested?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I think one can attain good heath without check ups &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blood tests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm always dubious about putting my health into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hands of someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who's livelihood depends on there being sick people.
</em><br>
<p>Suit yourself.  It's your life you're risking by such stereotypes.:)
<br>
<p>Also, since most people on this list, I bet, already have health plans, it's
<br>
merely a matter of getting poked with a needle once or twice a year, getting
<br>
the results -- not just the physician's interpretation, but the actual
<br>
numbers -- and going over these with others.  Not much of an investment,
<br>
especially when the blood testing can often be done at your convenience.  (I
<br>
was tested a few months ago at my office.)
<br>
<p>The reason to do this, again, is that many health problems that can be
<br>
spotted early enough can be treated and even cured.  These are ones that
<br>
often do not show symptoms.  Granted, they are rare, but not so rare as that
<br>
we should throw caution to the wind, especially given the low price of most
<br>
blood testing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;How many are on healthy diets?  not overweight?  take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;supplements?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By also taking the fun roller blades option and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthy diet I am not overweight,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but have yet to find any supplements that improve on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my body's chemical balance.
</em><br>
<p>How do you know?  Are you doing some testing on the side?  If so, tell us
<br>
what.  I'd like some cheaper alternatives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;One would hope people who are interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;maximum lifespans are doing this more than the rest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of the population, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from the few people I've met over the years --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;admittedly, not a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sample, since it is small and extemely biased:) -- it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;seems like it's more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;talk than action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This is sad, since lots of nontraumatic, preventable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;things can kill NOW,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;such as heart disease and certain other easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;prevented diseases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There could be something to be said for dieing of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily preventable disease
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.e. it's easier to cure you after cryostasis.
</em><br>
<p>Again, if you want to take that gamble, do right ahead.  Personally, I'd
<br>
rather be alive and avoid cryostasis all together.  I see it only as an
<br>
extremely long shot to be used as a last resort.  (Don't get me wrong here.
<br>
I'm all for cryonics and urge others to sign up, but I also urge all of you
<br>
not to plan for cryonics as your only means of life extension.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
