<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;So we should dump everything at will into our little cage and see what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;happens?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's not exactly what I am arguing for is it? It is not what is happening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now either.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
How not?  A company uses a new chemical, dumps it, and if and when sufficient
<br>
evidence is found against it then it may be banned.  But lots of new chemicals
<br>
are produced, probably outpacing regulatory inspection.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Proving that something is safe may be impossible.  But at least looking at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;persistent stuff to see what it might do seems only intelligent.  Look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;before you leap, yes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes and we do that.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Again, how so?  Perhaps I'm ignorant of standard procedure; how do we look
<br>
ahead?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Electricity isn't created out of thin air you know, soot particles from gas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and coal, radioactive waste, magnetic fields around High Voltage wires
</em><br>
<p>Soot particles don't accumulate in fish at 2000x environmental concentrations,
<br>
as far as I know.  Some radioactive waste does; radioactive dumping is banned.
<br>
<p>The usual scientific argument against the fear of transmission wire fields is
<br>
that the radiation is too pathetic to plausibly have any effect; if statistics
<br>
proved there was an effect, it'd be New Science.  The plausibility of a
<br>
persistent and accumulative chemical causing damage is way higher.  In fact, I
<br>
wonder how many chemicals meet Sweden's definition and are harmless?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Fertilizers certainly are accumulative and is killing the low waters around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I don't think they are accumulative.  They get used as food.  They don't
<br>
poison things, they feed algae which swamp the area.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  slow development/low risk               fast development/high risk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  poor society                                       wealthy society
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
And now that we're wealthy we can afford to be more cautious.  Especially as
<br>
the greater wealth gives us more power to fuck up if the risk happens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have (very high) taxes on cars, gas, electricity, fertilizers, pesticides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and consumption in general. None of these &quot;enviromental&quot; taxes are used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better the enviroment. But to further their own agena.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Regulations can be abused.  But in the US I think the EPA has done a good job
<br>
of making things better.  Not that we're likely to adopt the precautionary
<br>
principle, especially with Bush in office.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Fair point. The safer the better. Only problem is that the greens are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacking the test fields and destroying the crops. They don't want safe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development, they want no development.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Well, I hardly agree with experiment-breaking.  That's evil.  But not all
<br>
people concerned with the environment are anti-science Greens.  Some of them
<br>
are scientists.
<br>
<p>Hmm, I wonder what Greg thinks of this?
