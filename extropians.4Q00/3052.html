Like others, this post of mine never came through, so probably was 
<br>
dropped.  My apologies if it comes through again later.
<br>
<p>================================
<br>

<em>&gt;&gt;  No, unless the industry is of vital importance to protecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  lives (and property rights) of the citizens of the country, like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  military.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You've pointed to an important service of government. In addition to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;military industry, what about the banking industry? If the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;didn't &quot;prop up&quot; banks by providing police protection, gangs of thugs with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machine guns could take over all the banks. (wait, maybe they already did
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that when I wasn't looking -- Bankster.com ?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't think that means banks don't deserve to exist. (They may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deserve to exist for other reasons, but not particularly because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government &quot;propping up&quot; their security.) The same argument applies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;practically all industries at least to some degree. Without government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;propping up&quot; Microsoft, bands of well-armed thieves could have taken over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all Bill's campuses long ago.
</em><br>
<p>Protecting banks (and others) from gangs of thugs is a &quot;property 
<br>
right&quot; issue, and explicitly falls within the argument that I wrote 
<br>
above.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Anyway, you're not going to keep government from propping up industries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The primary education industry (public education) would evaporate without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;propping up by government. In this case, I might agree that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particular industry does not deserve to exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Hey, teacher! Leave those kids alone!&quot; --Pink Floyd
</em><br>
<p>Generally, I take a minimalist, mostly-Libertarian view of what 
<br>
should and shouldn't be propped up by our Government.  Public 
<br>
education, as you imply is arguable. :)  It certainly could use a 
<br>
good swift kick in the ass.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;And don't forget the prison industry. Does it deserve to exist? Probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not. But government doesn't need to prop up such a lucrative (and sick and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong and ugly) industry. The privatization of US incarceration stands to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enslave tens of millions instead of the one million it presently does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Investors are not difficult to find.
</em><br>
<p>We could drastically reduce our prison population by removing the 
<br>
laws we have against victimless crimes (prostitution, casual drug 
<br>
use, etc.)
<br>
<p>After that, once again, prison maintenance is fundamentally an issue 
<br>
of property protection - so does fall under the job of the 
<br>
government.  Now, whether or not private industry can be allowed to 
<br>
help out where it makes sense is a much deeper argument than I'm 
<br>
prepared to have.  I'd imagine that you'd need to have a lot of 
<br>
oversight to prevent abuses.  Whether or not the oversight costs more 
<br>
than having the government maintaining the things outright would have 
<br>
to be estimated or demonstrated.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;As for Gnutella,
</em><br>
<p>Oh yeah, we're talking about Gnutella. :)  I forgot all about those guys.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  I don't think the problem relates to the dearth of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;content, but rather with a lack of vision.
</em><br>
<p>I never did say anything about the dearth of content.  Actually, my 
<br>
original statement merely expressed disdain for those building a 
<br>
system designed to circumvent the rights of copyright holders. 
<br>
Ironically, the system is failing because people are selfishly taking 
<br>
from the system but not contributing to its resources.
<br>
<p>It's always a damned shame when greediness of non-contributors 
<br>
destroys a system designed to help a bunch of greedy non-contributors.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Someone needs to present an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outline of what the new economy will do to improve the human condition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not just how it will make money for infrastructure and content providers.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if swapping Bittany Spears MP3's doesn't improve the human 
<br>
condition, I just don't reckon I know what does.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
