<p>Thats a straw man, the old hostage taker guilt trip. Is using force to
<br>
stop people from using force wrong or hypocritical? That is the whole
<br>
principle of self defense. Eliminating programs that depend upon the
<br>
involuntary confiscation of private property to exist is not wrong.
<br>
<p>I want a new Lamborghini. I think the government should provide me with
<br>
one. If you prevent me from making the government give me one, paid for
<br>
from money confiscated from you, then are you wrong to do so? I don't
<br>
think so.
