<p><p>Actually, police departments and federal agencies that use silencers are

often required to purchase silencers that meet OSHA requirements for

hearing protection.  The fact that silencers (suppressors, really) are
<br>
designed to meet OSHA requirements for hearing protection from firearm
<br>
noise should tell you something.  Most people don't even know that there
<br>
is an OSHA regulation for the suppression of firearm noise.  It does seem
<br>
odd that something that is mandatory for occupational safety is outlawed
<br>
for safety away from the job.
<br>
<p>I guess the health of some citizens is more important than others.
