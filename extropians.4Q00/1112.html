<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Bubble Bulletin    - by Doug Noland
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liquidity
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October 13, 2000
<br>
&quot;...What had been an unfolding financial dislocation took a dramatic turn for
<br>
the worst earlier this week.  And despite today’s wild rally, it is my view
<br>
that we are now in the midst of a full-fledged financial crisis.  Further, for
<br>
the U.S. financial system and economy, the Middle East crisis could not
<br>
have come to a head at a more inopportune time.  In numerous
<br>
commentaries, we have written extensively on the issue of financial
<br>
fragility and we do not think one can overstate the critical importance of
<br>
this concept.  Unfortunately, over this protracted boom cycle the U.S.
<br>
financial system has developed acute vulnerability to the point that it
<br>
hangs in a truly fragile balance – there is absolutely no room for error.
<br>
There is going to be an accident, it is only a matter of time and under what
<br>
circumstances.  The amount of leveraged speculation is unprecedented...&quot;
<br>
<p>[The previous CBB has a chart of Xerox's practically overnight corporate
<br>
paper meltdown- spreads now at junk bond levels. Seems they ran off a few
<br>
too many copies of it. Spreads, e.g. between corporate bonds and 10-year
<br>
Treasuries, widen as credit quality deteriorates. They are an early indcator. ]

<p>&quot;...You always hurt the one you love. . . Even as I have chronicled the abuse
<br>
of the euro, I have cautioned that the dollar would have a problem some day
<br>
after the
<br>
&nbsp;stock bubble burst. Colin Negrych made some observations this morning on this
<br>
subject that I agree with:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The U.S. has $65.5 billion in reserves to defend the dollar. This is a
<br>
pittance relative to the value of U.S. assets held by foreigners, both
<br>
securities and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;business interests. When the dollar starts to fall against the euro, as it
<br>
has been doing for years against the yen, the &quot;dollar crisis&quot; mentality will
<br>
take
<br>
hold. The U.S. macroeconomic imbalances make a 25- to 40-percent adjustment in
<br>
the dollar the most likely outcome. This event will be resisted in
<br>
&nbsp;every way possible, but the efforts will fail.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The U.S. has sucked in massive amounts of foreign capital with captivating
<br>
tales of high returns and low risk bolstered by high growth and low inflation,
<br>
&nbsp;all made possible by a surge in productivity resulting from the application of
<br>
technology. There is now plenty of evidence the foregoing is a fatal
<br>
fiction....&quot;

More thoughts on the Key assets and liabilities
<br>
ORO (10/13/2000; 17:00:58MT - usagold.com msg#: 38967)
<br>
First the missing URL
<br>
<a href="http://www.yardeni.com/public/flqual_c.pdf">http://www.yardeni.com/public/flqual_c.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;An open question:
<br>
<p>&quot;The Fed publishes a &quot;key assets and liabilities&quot; of the Federal Reserve System
<br>
which encompases bank assets and liabilities other than Money Market funds. The
<br>
assets less liabilities
<br>
balance among these has been falling steadilly from some $70-80 billion to
<br>
under $10 billion today, on a total of some $4.7 trillion in either assets or
<br>
liabilities. This would seem to indicate
<br>
some difficulty on the Fed's part in maintaining interest rates at these &quot;high&quot;
<br>
levels. They will have to lower rates so that it would be possible for banks to
<br>
play the carry margin/spread
<br>
between the Fed rate and the market rate of interest. Otherwise, if these
<br>
figures have any significance, insolvency of the system is just around the
<br>
corner. The key asset less key liabilities
<br>
figure has a loose relationship to the points at which the Fed decides to start
<br>
lowering interest rates in order to support the banking system.
<br>
<p>&quot;The above URL has on pgs 7-9 charts of spreads between corporates and
<br>
treasuries, that indicate heavy deflationary fear in the markets as they are at
<br>
the highest spreads recorded, and
<br>
at double their 1993-7 range. In terms of the originary interest concept, the
<br>
relative discount of future goods vs. current goods, it has risen to double its
<br>
prior rate and the expected long
<br>
term price inflation is at 6.8%, down from 7.5% at the end of spring. This is
<br>
still reflected in backwardations in a number of commodity futures markets,
<br>
particularly in energy.&quot;
<br>
<p>If the Fed system is insolvent on its own, it does not mean that it is
<br>
illiquid. Meaning that the margin of available funds for settlement of
<br>
transactions is generally sufficient. However, such
<br>
conditions of insolvency are an invitation for some to speculative attack....&quot;

<p>International Perspective    - by Marshall Auerback
<br>
&nbsp;WHEN WILL THE US PLAY THE FINAL MORAL HAZARD CARD?
<br>
<p>[Meaning monetizing/intervening in the stock market.]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13 October 2000
<br>
&quot;...Fund manager William Fleckenstein, whose comments are quoted in the
<br>
&nbsp;context of the recent joint intervention to support the euro and the
<br>
&nbsp;concomitant announcement by President Clinton to sell 30 million barrels
<br>
&nbsp;out of the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve, had this to say:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;“Bubbleonians have become belatedly concerned about the euro and oil,
<br>
so in one fell swoop today the powers that be decided to intervene to try to
<br>
&nbsp;fix those markets.  My extraordinarily brilliant and pithy friend Colin
<br>
&nbsp;Negrych described today’s action as an ‘S&amp;PR release...and an
<br>
intel-vention.’  He went on to say: Stocks became the primary tool of
<br>
&nbsp;economic policy in the G-22 many months ago, first and foremost in the
<br>
&nbsp;U.S..  Whatever is harmful to stocks, the vehicle by which the greatest
<br>
&nbsp;government confiscation of wealth ever is being effected, will be targeted
<br>
&nbsp;for neutralization…&quot;
<br>
<p>John Crudele's NY Post article on Friday also called for Fed/gov intervention.
<br>
This will not work, except perhaps in the short term. The net result will be
<br>
worse
<br>
than no intervention. There appears to have been such an intervention at 10:30
<br>
AM
<br>
Oct. 12th. The melt-up on Friday appeared to have been institutionals -pension
<br>
funds, mutual funds making &quot;f*uck it&quot; puts.
<br>
<p>=============
<br>
<p>And for the big picture, updated today, see
<br>
<a href="http://www.usagold.com/goldTrail/default.html">http://www.usagold.com/goldTrail/default.html</a>
<br>
<p>The only lasting impact the historic 70s dollar price inflation had was to set
<br>
off a search to create a replacement for the world's greenback reserve system.
<br>
A &quot;political will&quot; was created to
<br>
hold this reserve system together at any and all cost and for whatever amount
<br>
of time was needed to build said replacement. If the &quot;will&quot; was not strong
<br>
enough or &quot;time&quot; not long enough,
<br>
it was easy to see that gold would be the fall back reserve. Indeed, that would
<br>
be quite a fall back, especially for those people (governments included)
<br>
without gold.
<br>
<p>[meaning if the Euro collapses then gold at free market rates is Plan B. The
<br>
point being to salvage world trade while allowing the dollar to find its
<br>
intrinsic value.]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;There is a huge difference between controlling an &quot;ongoing price inflation&quot;
<br>
and battling an ongoing timeline failure of your currency. The first is
<br>
controlled through printing restraint, while the second is managed to a bitter
<br>
end. Some would sarcastically say &quot;it's manipulated for it's longest lasting
<br>
effects&quot;....&quot;
<br>
<p>'...To date, Another's view and position has been and is continuing to be
<br>
right. The dollar paper system is on fire and the gold paper system is failing
<br>
from continuous supply. The dollar is
<br>
being forced upward as oil values rise, blocking all efforts of the Fed to
<br>
raise rates and contract the runaway system. Hyperinflation is directly in our
<br>
path....&quot;
<br>
<p>[E.g. a prediction that an oil country (Iraq, it turns out) would demand
<br>
payment in Euros was made by 'Another' about 2 years ago. Others (Iran in
<br>
particular) may follow soon, reducing external dollar demand. This on top of
<br>
the already collapsing external dollar debt will lead to a (competitive)
<br>
currency devaluation- the global race to the bottom.]
