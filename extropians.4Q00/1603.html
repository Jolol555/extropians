<p>You said that information about other universes is communicated by the very act
<br>
of differentiation if the split between one universe and another is the matter
<br>
of a photon flipping one way and not the other. If universe A is the way it is
<br>
because Photon P flipped right, that universe knows that universe B is the way
<br>
it is because Photon P flipped left (and vice versa). If every universe retains
<br>
knowledge about how every quantum decision flipped in its own history, it has
<br>
knowledge about every other universe that spun off from it in the past. We can
<br>
then apply this to Fermi's Paradox, and infer that if intelligent species come
<br>
in contact, due to the temporal offset probabilities, every intelligent species
<br>
has been influenced by every intelligent species that has come in contact with
<br>
its world or solar system in the past to at least some small degree. The two
<br>
species do not neccessarily need to come into concious communication for one to
<br>
influence the other. See what I mean (or what you mean, as the case may be)?
<br>
<p>What Fermi assumes is that every intelligent species will always overrun and
<br>
wipe out native biota on every world they come in contact with, and will build
<br>
and abandon structures that retain some evidence of intelligent influence for
<br>
many millenia, and it is only under these assumptions that his paradox is a
<br>
problem. Thus Fermi falls for the mistake of Brittannus, who as Ceasar comments,
<br>
&quot;Mistakes the habits and customs of his tribe for the laws of nature.&quot;
