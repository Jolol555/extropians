</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Depends. Doing so would dilute the influence of the senate in the
<br>
electoral college.
<br>
Senators lost prestige when it became a position which one was elected
<br>
to by popular vote. Used to be that senators were appointed by the
<br>
Governor of a state, and thus did not have any reason to engage in the
<br>
sort of demagogue antics we've seen from many current and former
<br>
senators lately. They could remain dignified, while their popularly
<br>
elected counterparts in the House of Representatives practically
<br>
invented the arts of ambulance chasing, baby kissing, pork barrel graft,
<br>
etc. Because they were not elected, Senators retained essentially the
<br>
same dignity as someone like Alan Greenspan or an Ambassador. Respect is
<br>
not a result of rarity or ubiquity. Its easier to respect 100 honorable
<br>
men than 26 (or one) dishonorable ones.
