<p>
I didn't speak of preclusion, I just asked what was planned for those
<br>
three timeframes.
<br>
<p>Quoth J. R. Molloy:
<br>
<em>&gt; The fact that information wants to be free doesn't preclude privacy, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just makes privacy less than free, temporarily frustrating the liberation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of information.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Temporarily&quot;. You said it, not me. Face and behavior-noticing neural
<br>
nets will be cheap enough to peel off and stick like Britney stickers
<br>
someday, probably sooner than we'd like. So gross location and activity
<br>
monitoring is basically a given. This has a big impact on what a lot of
<br>
average people would construe as &quot;privacy&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Cryptocurrency, Mixmaster, etc. are well and good, but as I think Bruce
<br>
Schneier likes to put it, some approaches to security are like putting a
<br>
single fence picket a mile high in the ground and hoping all your
<br>
adversaries run into it and knock themselves unconscious.
