<em>&gt; PS: I'd favor Eliezer in the first rounds, but I think Eugene would pull ahead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the middle of the bout. Then Eliezer would flounder unless he could come up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a working AI. If someone injected evolvable algorithms into Eliezer's Code,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would cinch his final victory, if the match were allowed to go that far.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But depending on where the match were held, local officials might stop the fight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before useful AI could emerge. So Eugene would win in that case by default.
</em><br>
<p>Nah, give each a 128 node Beowulf system (each node is a 1ghz Athlon) to run on.
<br>
Each gets x time to load and construct/evolve their AI's, then they compete in a
<br>
virtual landscape constructed and operated by a third system. One key component
<br>
is while competing head to head, each has a virtual tamagotchi they have to care
<br>
for simultaneously. Competitions would cover the whole range, from combat, to
<br>
puzzle solving, art &amp; music to free form essay questions judged by human judges
<br>
and 'compassion contests'.
<br>
<p>What I'm most interested in seeing is some AI module for generating original
<br>
initiative.
