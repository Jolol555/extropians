<p>Thank!  You!  Brian!  This is all I wanted, a little reassurance that
<br>
someone was at least *thinking* about safety, at least *thinking*
<br>
that humankind can live peacefully alongside the AI.  We can!
<br>
Chimps live on the same planet with humans.  We dont want to throw
<br>
mankind upon the mercy of the first generation AI.
<br>
<p>I am optimistic enough to think that superintelligence leads to
<br>
super-emotions, and that given time, a sufficiently evolved AI will
<br>
*love* us.  Humans are funny!  We are sexy.  We have some
<br>
lovable traits, some admirable traits, we are creative and we are
<br>
interesting.  Even after the coming revolution, I would like to see
<br>
some fraction of mankind continue (willingly of course) in their fragile
<br>
carbon-based state.  Honest to god, life is fun, even those decades
<br>
that have 3s and 4s in the tens column.  Tell us that the AI guys
<br>
are planning *something* as an escape mechanism, and I mean
<br>
something more convincing than Clarke's automatic cable cutter
<br>
on HAL's power cord.  Let's see: packing explosives around
<br>
the SIAI mainframe rigged to explode should HWoMBeP's heart
<br>
stop...
