<p>Why do you assume that the people I references were drunk or young or punks?
<br>
The sad fact is that there is a lot of rural bigotry against other 
<br>
races, religons and sexual orientations.  I simply don't see rural 
<br>
communities as having more tolerance for different cultures or 
<br>
behaviors than city communities.  I meant no disrespect toward any 
<br>
specific culture, but I don't think any can claim the moral high 
<br>
ground either.
