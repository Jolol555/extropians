I think &quot;smart&quot; psychedelics would be a good thing.  By smart, I mean
<br>
psychoactives whose effects would be known prior to ingestion.  I once
<br>
dropped acid and had a very good &quot;trip.&quot;  I can understand why people would
<br>
describe it as a mind-expanding experience (although I don't necessarily
<br>
think that's what *I* would call it).  The experience seemed
<br>
earth-shatteringly life-changing at the time, but that effect passed not
<br>
long after the drug wore off.  I do believe however that I did gain some
<br>
insights into my own personality which have stayed with me to this day
<br>
(close to 20 years later).
<br>
<p>The problem IMO with psychedelics as we have them today is their
<br>
unpredictability.  I had a good trip.  Lot's of folks don't.  And from what
<br>
I understand, a bad trip on acid can be *really* bad.  Worse, I've read that
<br>
long-lasting neuroses or psychoses have been triggered in a small percentage
<br>
of users.  So, all in all, I don't think our presently known psychoactives
<br>
are very &quot;extropic.&quot;  But designer &quot;smart&quot; psychoactives which would have
<br>
predictable effects on the user would be.

Subject: Psychedelics

<p><p><em>&gt; I have had some very transformative experiences via psychedelics that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatly assisted me in widening my perspective, integrating my
</em><br>
personality,
<br>
<em>&gt; and increasing my understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have not found anything in the Extropian materials regarding
</em><br>
psychedelics.
<br>
<em>&gt; Do any of you think that psychedelics can play a role in transhumanism?
