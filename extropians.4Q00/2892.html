From: Anders Sandberg [mailto:<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=RE:%20Psychedelics&In-Reply-To=&lt;7735CD154061C041B0D0E1D806C5D8A22857@mind.seventhmaze.byz.org&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>]
<br>
<em>&gt; Personally I think other means such as self-hypnosis and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-suggestion (enhanced for example by ritual) can be even very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful metaprogramming tools.
</em><br>
<p>I completely agree.  Metaprogramming is not in any way tied to the use of
<br>
psychedelics.  Self-hypnosis, self-suggestion, meditation, visualization,
<br>
NLP, lucid dreaming, and other techniques may all be useful.  Even more
<br>
mainstream psychological techniques such as Cognitive Therapy are forms of
<br>
meta-programming.
<br>
<p>(BTW, I do not mean to endorse all the techniques above.  While they *may*
<br>
all be useful, there is a lack of data on the effectiveness of most of
<br>
them.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In my view (as a computational neuroscientist interested in learning),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea isn't bad at all. My main problem with it is that most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drugs around produce states that may produce a very fluid view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality, but they also make the users so confused that it is hard for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to do the desirable changes.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, often psychedelics can produce confusion, but again I would say that
<br>
this is affected by many variables:
<br>
<p>Set - the mood, desire, and expectation of the person entering the
<br>
psychedelic experience.  If you choose to have a very clear, lucid
<br>
experience, chances are better that you will.
<br>
<p>Setting - The atmosphere and environment in which you take the drug.  If
<br>
you want to have lucid experience, choose a peaceful atmosphere you are
<br>
comfortable with.  The home, parks on a sunny day, museums, and many other
<br>
venues can be useful for this.
<br>
<p>Experience - Initial psychedelic experiences are often confusing, in part
<br>
because one is really not sure what to expect.  Second and subsequent
<br>
experiences are more known quantities, and thus less rife with confusion
<br>
and also more amenable to sculpting by the person embarking on the
<br>
experience.
<br>
<p>To be clear, my initial psychedelic experiences were purely recreational
<br>
(though driven by a desire to broaden my experience of the world and
<br>
myself, which I find quite extropic).  It was only later that I found them
<br>
to be useful tools, particularly in combination with other techniques
<br>
listed above.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
