</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;                          To kill 2 CIA employees and wound three others
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;outside Langley, VA headquarters in 1993
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;This was a former CIA type, was it not? A falling out amongst thieves!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;No, it was a middle eastern terrorist type, I believe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I suppose no &quot;middle eastern&quot; types were ever CIA operatives or moles?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
That's like saying that Tim McVeigh was a CIA mole!  We have had a notoriously difficult time infiltrating islamic terrorist groups, and depend almost exclusively upon tips from Mossad, spysat pictures and NSA comm interceptions for our intel in such matters.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'd rather that school guards (and bank guards, as well) be fit and well 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trained instead of obese or frail geezers supplementing their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;retirement.  I do NOT want teachers armed in class, &gt; any more than I want 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;school guards teaching english composition, physics or chemistry; I'd much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather leave each profession to its respective professionals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Reasonable point. Teachers should not be acting as armed guards. We need a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paradigm shift in teaching, anyway. Maybe take the whole business away from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;govt. and put it in the hands of private businesses who would be answerable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to their customers - the students and parents?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Still, if a teacher carries protection for personal use, why should they be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disarmed just because of the present location? The bad guys won't play by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the rules - so there is NO truly safe place where such restrictions would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We've had metal detectors and airport style wand frisks at Chicago schools 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for quite a while - the little angels still manage to bring in guns. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There's no solution past totally nude education that can stop all the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contraband at the door. Hey - now there's a new paradigm - but, thinking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;back on some of my teachers, maybe not - wouldn't want to scare the kids!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
One teacher here had her purse, containing her gun, stolen by students.  If they're not strapped, snapped and constantly monitored (which is not helpful to one's teaching or teacher-student relations), they're not secure.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Actually, handguns and shotguns are better for close range home 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;protection. Rifles are intended for medium to long-range fire, or for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;rapid firefight spray if they are semiauto or auto.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The very weapons HCI wants to eliminate first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
HCI, as far as I understand their stated position, wants to keep handguns, and indeed all guns, out of the hands of psychos, violent criminals and children.  Remember that the founder, Sarah Brady, is a woman whose husband took a bullet for Ronald Reagan, shot from a handgun purchased by a (still) certified psycho who was trying to impress Jodie Foster, whom he had never met, inspired by a movie.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;Stupid laws like the &quot;assault weapon&quot; ban are just incremental gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;prohibition - especially if the definition of &quot;assault weapon&quot; continues to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;mutate, like in California.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Actually, what mutated were the guns. The manufacturers produced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;cosmetically altered copycat versions specifically designed to circumvent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the ban while retaining the desired rapid-fire characteristics, and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;law was amended to cover them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not really. California continuously changes the rules, and has no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compunction about confiscation. Many people who registered their SKSs found 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out the hard way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
When the guns change to circumvent the rules, the rules have to change to stymie the circumvention.  It's coevolutionary.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I also do not advocate gun registration, but rather people registration; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the maintainence of a purchase-prohibited list that must be referenced by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;background check prior to a sale. I CAN see the point in a short waiting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;period, until all the records that need to be accessed are made instantly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;accessible. There are also such things as 'crimes of passion' and 'jealous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;rages'; but I cannot see preventing a sane and law-abiding adult from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;immediately buying a means of personal protection, although I would also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;hope that they would call the police.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now we are in agreement almost totally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;An interesting note:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Right at this moment - the radio is quoting how Cook County Sheriff Sheahan 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is recalling 5000 free gun locks he was handing out - they can be opened by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a hard blow. When he issued the locks a week ago, the antis hailed this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;sensible&quot; move - now they are claiming it was all a publicity stunt by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wacko gun nuts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
We have the same problem in this county, too; locks are being recalled and new ones are being obtained for distribution.
<br>
