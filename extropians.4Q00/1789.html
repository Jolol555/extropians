<p>One Final, Cheap Shot at Space 
<br>

<br>
<p>The field of contenders for the Cheap Access to Space Prize, which
<br>
just a month ago included a half-dozen teams hoping to launch by the
<br>
Nov. 8 deadline, has been winnowed to one.
<br>
<p>The $250,000 cash prize was offered three years ago to the first group
<br>
to launch a 2-kilogram payload to an altitude of 200
<br>
kilometers. Although many at first regarded the challenge as a
<br>
no-sweat proposition, not one of the 50 or so teams that entered has
<br>
made a prize attempt.

<br>
<p>The last team standing with two weeks to go before the deadline is the
<br>
High-Altitude Research Corporation, based in Huntsville, Alabama,
<br>
which plans to launch early Sunday from a utility boat in the Gulf of
<br>
Mexico 200 miles west of Tampa, Florida.
<br>
<p>HARC will try to get to space using a rockoon system.
<br>
<p>Its launching platform will be carried to an altitude of 70,000 feet,
<br>
at which point the rocket will be fired. By launching from above the
<br>
thickest part of the atmosphere, the team can use a lighter, less
<br>
powerful motor than if it launched from the ground.
<br>
<p>Greg Allison, an aerospace engineer who works as a contractor on the
<br>
International Space Station when he's not leading HARC, said it's not
<br>
surprising that so many of the CATS teams have come to grief.
<br>
<p>&quot;You've heard the saying that a chain is only as strong as its weakest
<br>
link,&quot; he said. &quot;Well, a rocket project has a whole lot of links.&quot;
<br>
<p>Participants in the contest -- designed to foster creation of new
<br>
launch companies and the development of ultra-cheap launch vehicles --
<br>
have been undone by problems with federal flight regulators and by the
<br>
basic difficulty of building a vehicle capable of going high enough
<br>
and fast enough to leave the atmosphere.
<br>
<p>J.P. Aerospace of Rancho Cordova, California, was derailed when the
<br>
Federal Aviation Administration's commercial space-transportation
<br>
office decided it needed more time to process the company's launch
<br>
application. JPA had applied in May for a waiver to launch from
<br>
Northern Nevada's Black Rock Desert on Oct. 7.
<br>
<p>SORAC, a Hollister, California group, also ran into trouble with the
<br>
FAA and Bureau of Land Management officials who oversee the Black Rock
<br>
Desert.  Interorbital Systems of Southern California, which planned a
<br>
Halloween launch from the Pacific 175 miles west of Vandenberg Air
<br>
Force Base, earlier this month became the only CATS team to receive a
<br>
full-on commercial launch license. But the company is no longer aiming
<br>
for a definite date.
<br>
<p>&quot;We were in this before the CATS Prize was announced&quot; in 1997,
<br>
Interorbital's Randa Milliron said. &quot;We may be outside the launch
<br>
window, but we'll launch whenever we're ready.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Danish Space Challenge, a group of amateurs from Copenhagen,
<br>
scheduled an attempt for Nov. 1 from the southeastern Greenland town
<br>
of Kangerlussuaq. Its shot was scrubbed last week because the team had
<br>
fallen hopelessly behind in its construction effort.
<br>
<p>&quot;We were ready in mind, but not in metal,&quot; team leader Jeppe Locht
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>Interorbital's Milliron, among others, has expressed hope that the
<br>
CATS organizers will extend the contest deadline or renew the prize
<br>
offer.
<br>
<p>She says history -- Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic flight, for
<br>
which he won a $25,000 prize put up eight years earlier by a New York
<br>
hotelier -- offers a precedent.
<br>
<p>&quot;The deadline is artificial. The prize that Lindbergh won when he
<br>
crossed the Atlantic -- no one set a deadline on that,&quot; she
<br>
said. Extending the contest would be &quot;the gentlemanly thing to do,&quot;
<br>
she added.
<br>
<p>The CATS Prize jackpot came from Walt Anderson, the telecom
<br>
billionaire who has led the effort to keep Russia's Mir space station
<br>
in orbit for tourism and other private enterprise.
<br>
<p>David Anderman, the CATS Prize administrator, has insisted that
<br>
neither the deadline nor the duration of the contest will change.
