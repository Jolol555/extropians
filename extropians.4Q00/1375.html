<p>
The method used at the time the Bible was written to calculate pi was to divide
<br>
a circle up into little pie slices, then calculate the area of each as if they
<br>
were triangles, instead of as a pie slice with an arc on one leg. This method
<br>
was used for thousands of years until the 19th or 20th century to reach ever
<br>
more accurate estimations of pi, and coming up with a true means of calculating
<br>
pi was the goal of many a true mathematician (as well as many dilletante quacks)
<br>
until it was proven that pi was a transcendental number in the late 19th
<br>
century. At the time of Pythagoras, pi had been calculated to a fraction equal
<br>
to four to six decimal places. The Great Pyramid of Cheops (or Khufu, as the
<br>
case may be) has demonstrated that at the time of its construction, the
<br>
egyptians had calculated pi accurately to 5 decimal places at a minimum, though
<br>
they could have been even more accurate, depending on what the exact dimensions
<br>
of its marble facing stones were (and the original dimensions of its interior).
<br>
If one buys the theory (that seems rather hard to dispute given the hard
<br>
evidence) that the three great pyramids, and other buildings around egypt were
<br>
built to form a huge simulation of the constellation Orion (who was their god
<br>
Osiris in their astronomy/astrology), then they likely would have needed to have
<br>
calculated pi to an accuracy of possibly as much as ten decimal places (in
<br>
fraction form, of course) in order to place these buildings as accurately as
<br>
they did.
<br>
<p>Given this, it seems rather obvious that anyone writing at the time about pi
<br>
equalling 3 must have been a rather illiterate primitive, writing on his own
<br>
recognizance, and NOT inspired or directed either by any deity or priesthood
<br>
(who were typically the most literate people in any society at the time).
<br>
<p>Now, given how scientists of the time were aware of the use of volume, I'm
<br>
wondering if a bored circular tube might have been used to calculate pi more
<br>
accurately then than by the pie slice method. Take a chunk of metal, and bore a
<br>
hole in it of a fixed radius. Then build a square tank with graduated rules on
<br>
the side to measure volume of the tank. Fill the bored cylindrical hole with
<br>
water, then pour that water into the square tank, and measure the result. Given
<br>
this volume, the known radius of the bored hole, and the known depth of the
<br>
bored hole, a generally accurate calculation of pi would result, only varying by
<br>
the distortion of the meniscus of the fluid. Since pythagoras had only
<br>
calculated pi out by a few hundred pie slices, it seems to me the fluid method
<br>
should have been more accurate at the time.
