<p><em>&gt; Perhaps so.  However I have been debating David Brin on these matters in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; email and in public since 1994.  All I have accomplished (if anything)
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have changed.
</em><br>
<p>On the other hand, _my_ positions have changed, from (troubled) natural-law
<br>
libertarianism in 1992 to something more like market-friendly liberal
<br>
democracy today.  Brin's been one influence.  (Soros's _Open Society_ was
<br>
another, very recently.  And Jane Jacobs.  And... never mind.)
<br>
<p>I don't agree with his attacks on cryptography or his tossing of all secrecy
<br>
(although I've come up with half-baked versions of machine intelligence
<br>
civilization which truly can't afford even the privacy of thoughts.  But we're
<br>
not machine intelligence yet, and imperfect enforcement of our bad law is one
<br>
of our check and balances) and he's hardly an ideal arguer.  His violent
<br>
withdrawal from John Clark's &quot;What about secret ballots?&quot; was unimpressive; I
<br>
thought it a fair challenge to the Transparent Society idea.  And he was too
<br>
quick to mock libertarians in &quot;Confessions...&quot; if he wanted to actually get a
<br>
word in with them; and while self-righteousness addiction is an interesting
<br>
idea, using it in direct argument ain't great.
<br>
<p>But America/the West being a nicer place to live than anything else yet
<br>
realized, yeah.  Accountability important, yeah.  Thuggery being the modal
<br>
[sic] human society, yeah.  Adaptive structures, rather than ideologically
<br>
deduced ones, hell yeah.  And when I read &quot;Confessions...&quot; as posted to the
<br>
list, and the responses, I thought he came out rather ahead.  But then I've
<br>
just been reading Soros's mockery of equilibrium theory as applied to
<br>
financial markets.
