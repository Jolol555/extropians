<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could you define &quot;consciousness&quot; for us in the sense of describing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you would have lost by being restored from a backup?
</em><br>
<p>The awareness of my self from a subjective point of view- my own existence.
<br>
A backup would only be a copy of me.  To an external observer, it would be
<br>
identical, and to it, it would be consciously aware as myself, but it would
<br>
not be me.  I would be gone, my conscious with me.
<br>
<p>See the recent movie &quot;The Sixth Day&quot;.  I can't remember the name of the
<br>
character at the moment, but near the end of the movie, when he clones
<br>
himself while he's dying, he realizes that the new self is not him, it is
<br>
merely a copy, and he's toast.  This is precisely what I'm talking about- a
<br>
copy is not the original.  The original, &quot;I&quot;, is what I'm concerned about-
<br>
not the data that is flying about, or the matter it's made up of.  Since we
<br>
still don't understand the nature of the &quot;I&quot;, we're a million miles from
<br>
truly duplicating it.
<br>
<p>-Nicq MacDonald
<br>
<p>&quot;We do progress, but how?  Not by the tinkering of the meliorist; not by the
<br>
crushing of initiative; not by laws and regulations which hamstring the
<br>
racehorse, and handcuff the boxer; but by the innovations of the eccentric,
<br>
by the phantasies of the hashish-dreamer of philosophy, by the aspirations
<br>
of the idealist to the impossible, by the imagination of the revolutionary,
<br>
by the perilous adventure of the pioneer.  Progress is by leaps and bounds,
<br>
by breaking from custom, by working on untried experiments; in short, by the
<br>
follies and crimes of men of genius, only recognizable as wisdom and virtue
<br>
after they have been tortured to death, and their murderers reap gloatingly
<br>
the harvest of the seeds they sowed at midnight.&quot; -Aleister Crowley, &quot;On
