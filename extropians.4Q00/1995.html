<br>
<p>Do allow me to make one semi-serious point among the mirth and jocularity.  
<br>
Whenever the nanotech enthusiasts speak publicly, they point out the dangers 
<br>
of the technology, and spend some time describing possible safety measures, 
<br>
such as Ralph's broadcast architecture.  Every time I hear Drexler or Merkle 
<br>
speak, they
<br>
mention safeguards.
<br>
<p>What is Singularity Institute's counterpart to that?  Are yall thinking 
<br>
safety?  Is there some kind of technology which would allow yall to hit the 
<br>
off switch if something goes awry?  You know Im a big fan of the HWoMBeP and 
<br>
all of yall, but if yall are rushing headlong into unknown and dangerous 
<br>
technology without appropriate safety measures (if such a term even applies) 
<br>
then I understand some of the criticism yall are getting.  spike&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From what I've read on the subject, some (by no means all, not even Vinge 
</em><br>
himself, if I read him right) proponents of Singularity believe that a) No 
<br>
countermeasures are likely to work, so Singularity is more or less 
<br>
inevitable; and, b) Whatever the consequences for humanity, Singularity is 
<br>
worth doing. 
<br>
<p>Personally, I don't believe Singularity is a serious possibility in the near 
<br>
future (the critical discussion at <a href="http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/vi.html">http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/vi.html</a> 
<br>
pretty much convinced me it ain't gonna happen any time soon, if ever). If it 
<br>
happens, and we let it happen, then we deserve whatever we get. But I'm about 
<br>
as worried about it as about those fellows at Brookhaven National Lab 
<br>
accidentally unleashing a black hole in our midst -- in other words, not much 
<br>
(no offense meant to any believers in Singularity -- I am just applying a 
<br>
little critical thinking here, and welcome any arguments trying to change my 
<br>
beliefs).
