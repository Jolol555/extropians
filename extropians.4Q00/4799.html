I once saw a couple of &quot;professional educators&quot; simper condescendingly
<br>
at me as they watched me explain the word &quot;metaphor&quot; to a five year old.
<br>
They &quot;knew better&quot; than to tell a five year old a word like that. 
<br>
<p>Why was I explaining the word? Because she'd just criticized something
<br>
I'd said, saying &quot;Not _really_.&quot; And I agreed. &quot;No, not _really_,
<br>
really. They call it a metaphor.&quot; &quot;What's _that_?&quot; So I told her. And I
<br>
told her what the difference between a metaphor and a fib was.
<br>
<p>She used the word five times within the next week. On her own.
<br>
<p>On the contrary, I recently used the word on the telephone with a
<br>
twelve-year-old. Her response was &quot;Don't use such big words; remember,
<br>
I'm only in *public* school.&quot;
<br>
<p>I hardly think an honest response to a question about bacteria destroys
<br>
sense of wonder. And I weep for the upbringing of the twelve-year-old.
<br>
<p>Is an ordinary five-year-old supposed to be told fairy tales when she
<br>
asks for an explanation about why she's supposed to brush her teeth? Is
<br>
&quot;tickling her imagination&quot;, in this instance, what is called for? 
<br>
<p>Are you assuming too much, perhaps?
