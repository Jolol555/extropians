Anders Sandberg asks,
<br>
<em>&gt; ...Many anti-enhancement people base their position on their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view that prenatal enhancements are against the integrity and dignity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the person. What would a transhumanist defence of such enhancements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be in terms of our views of personal integrity and human dignity? And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reverse, from these views, what would not be allowed?
</em><br>
<p>I would defend enhancements of whatever kind on the grounds that they
<br>
increase personal integrity and expand human dignity. Because that's what
<br>
enhancements do. They make things better, more beautiful, more free, more
<br>
excellent, healthier, more competent. Anyone who would argue against such
<br>
things simply and plainly does not understand the meaning of the word
<br>
&quot;enhancement.&quot;
<br>
<p>Reasonable people would not allow modifications or bio-engineering which
<br>
does not result in the enhancement (IOW improvement) of human life. BTW,
<br>
any society that can tolerate such an ugly and stupid procedure as
<br>
circumcision definitely has no business criticizing prenatal enhancements
<br>
which would help rather than hurt the innocent. Smacks of the pot calling
<br>
the kettle black. After all, few things are more against the integrity and
<br>
dignity of a person than mutilating their genitals without their
<br>
permission (and without anesthetics).
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
