<em>&gt;         From: Robin Hanson
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         This last week I told my microeconomics students about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         some of the economics of uploading this week.  I asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         how many of them would be willing to make an upload
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         copy of themselves (assuming their original remained intact).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Five out of fifteen of them said they would.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>*I* might turn such an offer down, post-Singularity, so I don't find their
<br>
refusal at all surprising.  Why gratuitously create a copy of yourself?  A
<br>
scan of my mind doesn't turn up any feelings about the matter either way,
<br>
which is actually rather surprising, but it's still an action that can't
<br>
be undone.  Pre-Singularity is another matter, of course; I'll take as
<br>
many copies as I can get.
