<p><p>@ Sign Invented in Italy 
<br>
<p>By Rossella Lorenzi, 
<br>
Discovery.com News 
<br>
<p>Aug. 1, 2000 - An Italian scholar has discovered that &quot;amphora,&quot; a
<br>
word referring to a weight unit used by ancient Greeks and Romans, is
<br>
the real name for the Internet's ubiquitous squiggle, the @ sign used
<br>
in email communications.
<br>
<p>Giorgio Stabile, who teaches the history of science at Rome's La
<br>
Sapienza University, traced the origin of the @ sign to at least 500
<br>
years ago, when Italian merchants invented it.
<br>
<p>The evidence was hidden in the archives at the Francesco Datini
<br>
Institute of Economic History in Prato, near Florence: a letter
<br>
written by Francesco Lapi, a Florentine trader, on May 4, 1536,
<br>
clearly shows what is the earliest known example of the quintessential
<br>
symbol of the Internet.
<br>
<p>Describing the arrival in Spain of three ships bearing gold and silver
<br>
from Latin America, Lapi writes: &quot;there an @ of wine, which is one
<br>
thirtieth of a barrel, is worth 70 or 80 ducats.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;In the document, the @ sign is the abbreviation for amphora, a
<br>
measure of capacity based on the terracotta jars used for
<br>
transportation in the ancient Mediterranean world,&quot; said Stabile, who
<br>
will publish his finding in a book for the Treccani Encyclopedia by
<br>
the end of the year.
<br>
<p>The sign has been a central part of the Internet since Ray Tomlinson
<br>
chose it as a separator in email addresses in 1972. Cybernauts of
<br>
various countries have given the sign nicknames from snail to strudel
<br>
and monkey's tail, but the @ sign was believed to derive from the
<br>
Latin word &quot;ad,&quot; meaning &quot;to, toward, at.&quot;
<br>
<p>The story goes that in late medieval cursive writing the upright
<br>
stroke of the &quot;d&quot; curved over to the left making a loop around the
<br>
&quot;a.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;This theory has no support from a paleographic point of view. In my
<br>
research, I ignored the metaphors related to the sign and considered
<br>
the only two denominations with a historical background: the English
<br>
&quot;commercial at&quot; and the Spanish &quot;arroba,&quot; said Stabile.
<br>
<p>Searching the commercial paleography, Stabile stumbled into a
<br>
Spanish-Latin dictionary of 1492: the word &quot;arroba&quot; was translated as
<br>
&quot;amphora,&quot; showing that the amphora weight unit was known both in the
<br>
Greek-Latin and in the Arab-Hispanic world.
<br>
<p>The amphora was long used as a measuring unit in Venice and along
<br>
trade Routes running to Northern Europe. There, it acquired its
<br>
contemporary commercial meaning, &quot;at the price of.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The story of the Latin roots of the sign was completely wrong,&quot; said
<br>
Armando Petrucci, professor of Latin Paleography at Pisa University.
<br>
&quot;Finally, Stabile's discovery sheds light on the history of this
<br>
successful sign.&quot;
