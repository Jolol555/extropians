<p>That is opinion, not fact and a biased strawman at that.  It might be
<br>
that some form of what you might call &quot;navel gazing&quot; yields the most
<br>
profound ability to manipulate physical reality all the way down to
<br>
vacuum flux.  If reality turns out to be more informational than
<br>
material/physical then some beings or even entire species may find the
<br>
only meaningful game to be pretty internal rather than what we would
<br>
call external.  There is no need to make provincial judgements about
<br>
such at this point of relatively little knowledge and understanding.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think we have more freedom to rewrite who we are and what &quot;we&quot; means
<br>
than that or very soon will have.  Used up all the atoms?  Create more! 
<br>
Socializing is actually pretty boring eventually as it becomes too
<br>
boringly predictable if the agents involved stop changing.
