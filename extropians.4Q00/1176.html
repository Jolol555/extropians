<p>In general, I dont know, but in the particular case with which I am
<br>
acquainted, the young lady has always been paralyzed from the waist
<br>
down, and those parts never did develop to any extent.  I honestly do
<br>
not know if her lack of growth above the paralysis point was caused
<br>
by the condition, or if she would have been small anyway.  Both
<br>
her parents are a bit on the shrimpy side, but the fact that the
<br>
girl *is* small may have saved her life, since there are known
<br>
problems with S.B. if the person grows large.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eris help me, this actually makes sense to me.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you *very much* Alex, you have made my day.  As it turns
<br>
out you are the first to bite on this notion.  People want to send a
<br>
tall, handsome young Captain America type to Mars, to plant a
<br>
damn striped piece of cloth and come home, I suppose.  What is
<br>
the point of that?  The first Martians need to stay and work, not
<br>
just explore and poke flags into the red soil.  We can build machines
<br>
that can explore.
<br>
<p>My notion is a one-way trip, with the idea to set up a farm, build
<br>
habitation modules by guiding and repairing semi-autonomous robots,
<br>
setting up for the next generation, who would actually be born
<br>
native to Mars.  I admit that it is an outrageously high-risk venture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Really, this would apply to many different types of disabilities.
</em><br>
<p>Right-o!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Microgravity could be the next great equalizer.
</em><br>
<p>Right-o!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is there an untapped extropic reserve among the worlds &quot;dis&quot;abled?
</em><br>
<p>There is.  Such a mission would lend new meaning to the
<br>
euphamism &quot;differently abled.&quot;  The differently abled are
<br>
pre-adapted to the confines of a Mars hab module.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At the very least, this gives me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and hopefully actual real sci-fi writers lurking on this list) the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beginnings of what could be a poigniant and inspiring sci-fi story.
</em><br>
<p>Truely.  Damien Broderick could go to town with something like this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not just physical disabilities either. I remember reading someplace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that people with autism who have found jobs in the computer industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes find their autism to actually be an asset.
</em><br>
<p>Or how about obsessive compulsive &quot;disorder.&quot;  If the person obsesses
<br>
about surviving in an unforgiving environment, that condition would come
<br>
to be called obsessive compulsive order.  spike
<br>
<p>ps. now youve gotten me on my old soapbox...  {8^D
