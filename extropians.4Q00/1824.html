<p>It is standard practice to describe the discount rate in simple

examples where there is no uncertainty, but I'm very sure the authors
<br>
are well aware that real decisions have uncertainty, and that they
<br>
intended their discount rate to be used in the standard expected
<br>
utility framework when there is uncertainty.
<br>
<p>It really doesn't matter for the purposes of the paper where people's
<br>
time preferences come from.  It just matters that people have them.
