Sweet dream are made of these. Order me a dozen.

<p>&lt;&lt; Subject: Spun nanotubes spell breakthrough
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PARIS, Nov 16 (AFP) - French researchers reported Thursday they  
<br>
&nbsp;had achieved a breakthrough in making carbon nanotubes, one of the 
<br>
&nbsp;most exciting inventions of the past decade, which could open the 
<br>
&nbsp;way to manufacturing them as fibres with a host of uses. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanotubes, first invented in 1991, are tubes with a diameter far  
<br>
&nbsp;smaller than a human hair, with a carbon structure that makes them 
<br>
&nbsp;chemically inert but light, extremely strong and resilient, as well 
<br>
&nbsp;as able to conduct heat and electricity. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are conventionally created by vaporising graphite rods by  
<br>
&nbsp;electric arc in a chamber filled with a gas such as helium or 
<br>
&nbsp;hydrogen, and then allowed to cool slowly. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists from the Paul Pascal Research Centre at the  
<br>
&nbsp;University of Bordeaux said they had devised a method to spin 
<br>
&nbsp;single-wall nanotubes into &quot;indefinitely long&quot; ribbons and fibres. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike other carbon fibres, they are extremely flexible and can  
<br>
&nbsp;even be knotted without breaking, they reported. Their research is 
<br>
&nbsp;published in full in Friday's issue of Science, the US weekly 
<br>
&nbsp;journal. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultra-strong fibres of this kind have a wide variety of  
<br>
&nbsp;potential applications, from artificial muscles to hydrogen storage 
<br>
&nbsp;and flat-screen TVs, the researchers hope. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ribbons were created by dispersing raw nanotube soot into a  
<br>
&nbsp;surfactant, or detergent, solution. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That solution was then injected into a flowing steam of polymer  
<br>
&nbsp;solution which caused the nanotube material to recondense into a 
<br>
&nbsp;mesh. The flow of the solution aligned the mesh into ribbon-like 
<br>
&nbsp;fibres. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 2, separate teams from Japan's NEC Corp. and the  
<br>
&nbsp;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology reported they had 
<br>
&nbsp;created the smallest nanotubes feasible, each narrower than a 
<br>
&nbsp;filament of DNA. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tubes were just 0.4 nanometres (0.4 billionths of a metre)  
<br>
&nbsp;wide. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists have previous created even smaller tubes, of 0.33  
<br>
&nbsp;nanometres. However, these are unstable because structural changes 
<br>
&nbsp;at this tiny scale can force carbon to become metallic.  &gt;&gt;
