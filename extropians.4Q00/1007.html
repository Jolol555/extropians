<p><em> &gt; I have been around long enough to see all too many

</em><br>
<p>Amen to that one.
<br>
<p>As to /. clones, they all have several minuses. For one, I have to
<br>
<p>* actively go out, and scan all of them (provided, I can remember 53
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sites, and go through the trouble of clogging my puny 34 kbps 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;0.01$/min pipe with the attempt to load them all)
<br>
<p>* not to mention have to succumb to limited design and presentation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;skills of the average webmonkey, who is trying hard to earn its keep
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Excuse me, I don't really want to play first player shooter games in 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the browser window (Java) nor check out the fully interactive frog 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the blender (Flash). All I want is hypertext with pictures, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;an occasional animation, thankyouverymuch).
<br>
<p>* No, I don't want to see more ads, and volunteer marketers behaviour
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;data, so that get more targeted spam 
<br>
<p>* unless I run a tweaked squid and have essentially infinite drive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;space I don't have that information stored. Not so with hypermailed 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and full-text indexed inboxes, these are much easier on drive space
<br>
<p>* I usually have about 100 browser windows open, which have lots of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;state in them. Sooner or later the whole shebang crashes, resulting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in me producing weird muffled noises and wanting to strangle Netscape 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;programmers. All of them.
<br>
<p>* Browsers not only crash, they eat memory like crazy for each page
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rendered. And, yeah, memory leaks. Lots of them. Comes with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;braindead programmers trying to render complex content specified 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in a braindead language transported by braindead protocols
<br>
<p>* slash(hash, dash, mash)dots do everything server-side, which does
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not allow me with to engage my proven idjit filter (notice that 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;even low grade morons can click, but it takes at least an 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;imbecile to set up a mail configuration, and subcribe to a 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;push medium. Also, the overhead usually prevents said idjits to fire 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;up their insightful one-liners)
<br>
<p>* I can go on, but this really proves web is totally broken
