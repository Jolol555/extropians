writes:&lt;&lt; I'm having a discussion here with my friends on the power needs of a
<br>
&nbsp;really wired society. So what does the list think about the likely power 
<br>
needs when everybody got their own wearable/smart cellphone on all the time, 
<br>
ubiquitious computing is in every corner, wireless internet in the air and 
<br>
bluetooth (or similar) devices everywhere?   &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Anders,     
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid 70s a fellow named Herman Kahn, at the Hudson Institute, did a 
<br>
book called THE NEXT TWO HUNDRED YEARS, or at least I think that is right.  
<br>
You might take a look at that.  I would think copies are still laying around 
<br>
in libraries and it might even be in print.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herman Kahn did a lot of extrapolating of population, power needs, fuel 
<br>
needs &amp; sources as well as food production.  I would think he might make a 
<br>
great starting point.
