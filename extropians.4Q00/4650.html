<p>Well, yes, and that would be cheating, since you wouldn't actually

answer or refute my objections: I'd just ignore them, or forget about
<br>
them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Got a telepathy machine that tells me how and what I feel?  How do you

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, do you take a Rylean view that &quot;mind&quot; is a category mistake and only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems a thing because language exists that describes it as an 'object?'
</em><br>
<p>No, but I reserve &quot;category error&quot; to refer to a very particular kind
<br>
of logical error.  I think the notion of a &quot;mind&quot; and &quot;mental events&quot;
<br>
makes logical sense, that there's nothing logically contradictory
<br>
about them.  I think one can be a consistent epiphenomenalist.  But
<br>
why?  :) Why not be an anti-realist instead? ;)
<br>
<p>To the extent that I agree with Ryle, I take him to be telling a
<br>
plausible story about what led us to conclude that consciousness is
<br>
really out there, that we shouldn't reinterpet &quot;consciousness&quot; to
<br>
refer to non-mental entities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There seems some mileage in this, but I happen to think that if MVT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accounts for all types of animal intelliegence/ conscious behaviour
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and (observable) cognitive patterns ... then it does permit me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postulate an extended &quot;analogous&quot; stronger version that take in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness as well ... if only for the sake of aesthetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completion ... and because some people will be able to find use in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepting the MVT structure (to replace faulty supernaturalist and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lingoistic competing theories of 'consciousness' such as Berkeley's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mind of God Idealism).
</em><br>
<p>Yes and no.  In fairness, until Foucault's Pendulum rolled around,
<br>
there really was no &quot;scientific&quot; way to settle the debate as to
<br>
whether the sun revolved around the earth or the earth around the sun;
<br>
after all, relative to the earth, the sun moves, and relative to the
<br>
sun, the earth moves.  Only by invoking the added principle of
<br>
elegance and explanatory simplicity did the Copernican astrology gain
<br>
an advantage.  After the fact, we now regard these to be normative
<br>
scientific values, principles which guide our scientific beliefs.
<br>
This is literally philosophy which BECOMES science, not by virtue of
<br>
new discoveries, but via a change in scientific paradigms.
<br>
<p>You might well get away with postulating that you've nailed
<br>
consciousness as well as conscious behavior.  I take it that our
<br>
CURRENT scientific values, our current beliefs about what claims are
<br>
scientifically grounded and which are not, do not allow you to make
<br>
this move, except via an oblique invocation of elegance as a
<br>
scientific principle.  And who knows, maybe in the future, science
<br>
will look back and say of those who denied that we had solved the
<br>
puzzle of consciousness that we have overlooked an important
<br>
scientific value.  But for now, as I use the term &quot;science,&quot;
<br>
consciousness theory is not science, whereas intelligence theory is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your stricter aesthetic does not permit you to find merit in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stronger conclusions of MVT, but does help in answering the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important questions about the evoloution of animal &quot;conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviour&quot; .... so everybody should be happy.
</em><br>
<p>Just so!  But before I admit this, I want to call attention to an
<br>
important philosophical move, one about which I will probably write my
<br>
senior thesis.
<br>
<p>To say that &quot;everybody is happy&quot; requires us to remain blissfully
<br>
ignorant about the aesthetic/philosophical question of the mind/body
<br>
problem.  It requires us to not know or care the answer to the
<br>
question: &quot;is this really a theory of consciousness or not?&quot;
<br>
<p>We might be skeptical about our capacity to answer that question.  We
<br>
might be sort-of pragmatic anti-philosopers and say: &quot;that question
<br>
cannot be answered&quot; or, even better, &quot;do not ask that question.&quot;
<br>
<p>Those who refuse to ask the question cannot be coerced into asking it,
<br>
and may remain consistently skeptical about any answer you put
<br>
forward.  To the extent that we answer it, it seems, we engage in
<br>
philosophy, which may or may not be &quot;scientific&quot; philosophy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Ah, no.  Holes are not &quot;objects&quot; at all.  They denote places where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; certain objects aren't, though I'm willing to extend the analogy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complex systems which have a missing component or a missing function.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A hole in the earth is not psychological.  One might be led to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so the fact that holes acquire NAMES by virtue of the fact that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; name them, think about them, and have a psychology in which that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possible, but that doesn't make holes psychological entities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The category of a particular area of space as a &quot;hole&quot; is indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychological ... the hole can only be demarked independently of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (physical) substrate by the naming of it (seeing it, pattern completion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and formulating it as a linguistic/ conceptual entity). It has no &quot;matter&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so isn't physical ..... but is observable ... an observer-related effect.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but we must be careful not to overload the term &quot;psychological.&quot;
<br>
Feelings are psychological, and so are &quot;holes,&quot; but they're
<br>
psychological in very different ways.  Sadness, for example, has no
<br>
physical place at all, by virtue of its purely mental character.
<br>
Holes are physical bits of space (or functions/components, ...) that
<br>
we use our minds to demarcate.  The NAME of the hole has a mental
<br>
component, but the hole itself, the referent, has no mental component
<br>
at all, despite the fact that its edges are mentally determined.
<br>
Feelings, on the other hand, have nothing BUT mental components.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This seems at least as &quot;sensible&quot; as the epiphenomenalist claim.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, I think the issue might be as much to do with aesthetics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive style as to which side of this (ultimately pointless)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divide you choose.  I prefer to concentrate on the empirical matters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and observable phenomena, and think this conversation has been a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prime example of the ultimate futility of philosophical analysis.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes.  It's a philosophical problem which we resolve by pondering
<br>
our intuitions on the matter, or which we refuse to resolve, since
<br>
it's pointless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; To be a consistent phenomenologist, one ought to be uniformly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; skeptical of the whole scientific enterprise.  Granted, if you give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientific statements a strong anti-realist reinterpretation (&quot;when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you say voltmeter, you mean voltmeter-like sensations...&quot;) you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; salvage much of science, but even then you still have no explanation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the link up between sensations-of-brains and consciousness.  No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; help in providing a link-up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The link between phantom (ex-) limbs and sensations in the previously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physically occupied space is well documented in medical science.
</em><br>
<p>Right, assuming science exists in the first place, uses real
<br>
equipment, consists of real researchers...  This is why I find
<br>
phenomenology worrisome.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Likewise the neurosignature and gateway theory of pain strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supports this linkage. In practice (as a therapist) we do not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the luxury of engaging in philosophical quibbles, but must act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positively to alleviate the symptoms according to our best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgement.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your &quot;consciousness isn't real&quot; posture just doesn't cut it in workaday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality.
</em><br>
<p>It works just as well as its opposing view, so long as one
<br>
pro-actively reinterprents consciousness claims into something else.
<br>
&quot;When you say you're in pain, you mean that your E fibers are firing,
<br>
and that's a bad thing; better get you some ibuprofen.&quot;  In practice,
<br>
we simply don't decide whether to re-interpret consciousness claims or
<br>
not, since their reinterpretation does not affect our decisions about
<br>
what to do about &quot;pain,&quot; whether pain is mental or purely physical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But you have conceded the priority of the mental by your admission that IF
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my MVT hypnotic persuasion works, then you agree with my stronger claims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for MVT. We only ever *experience* the world as filtered through ideation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and our senses.
</em><br>
<p>No, you misunderstood.  I simply granted that I'd believe you if you
<br>
hypnotized me, which follows directly from the fact that I'd be
<br>
hypnotized.  I'd believe that there were fairies in my garden if you
<br>
hypnotized me into believing as much.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No Turing machines of the sort you discuss have ever, not will ever,be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps not, but only on account of their being too cumbersome, slow,
<br>
expensive, and hard to build, not by virtue of their being different
<br>
in principle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Well, of course, if you convince me that way, I will be convinced, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; satisfied with the answer.  But does the fact that you COULD do this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; satisfy me?  No.  Because you'd be using MVT' to do all of this.  None
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the philosophical parts are required.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you would be convinced by the practice, but not by the theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... a fair comment. I adhere to certain psychotherapeutic ethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that might inhibit me using such techniques on you involuntarily,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I might consider doing this experiment if you consent ......
</em><br>
<p>Again, you misunderstand.  I'd be convinced, but only by virtue of my
<br>
hypnosis, not by holding better beliefs.  Your capacity to hypnotize
<br>
me doesn't prove your philosophical point.
<br>
<p>If I felt tongue-in-cheek, I'd say that if you hypnotized my like
<br>
that, I'd be hypnotized into being wrong.  ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Isn't the answer obvious?  You say, like a true scientist: &quot;I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know the answer.  There is no evidence.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neo-Darwinian evolution remains a &quot;theory&quot; and religious creationist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentalists will never accept it as fact ... but in practice most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists (as opposed to quibbling philosophers) accept it in practice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since the circumstantial, explanatory and utility case for is overwhelming.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes.  Ultimately, the biologists and the creationists disagree
<br>
about what may legitimately be called &quot;science.&quot;  I think it's
<br>
adequately established that evolution is in and creation is out; I'd
<br>
add that consciousness theory is out too, though it might get in if
<br>
our views of science changed or if we just leaned more heavily on
<br>
elegance than we do now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; No, it's relevant.  See, the mind can't affect the &quot;holes.&quot;  So it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can't affect the brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The SHAPE of the brain effects its function, the shape evolved, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (gestalt) can be described in terms of foreground OR background
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (holes), or both.
</em><br>
<p>But holes are different from sadness; different in kind and in
<br>
principle.  They may be linked, but they're not the same.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; No, I haven't at all: that was an argument that, even when you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; modify your metaprogramming, you are DETERMINED to modify your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; metaprogramming, and thenceforth DETERMINED to follow your new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (meta)program.  Always following the program, you are determined.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then, if we are determined in such a way that we have the option to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intervene and change our cognitive patterns .... then we are determined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in such a way that we have free-will. The whole trans/ post-human venture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an excercise of free-will against the cultural conditioning to remain the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same (boring, human, not-fit-to-run-the-planet received wisdom).
</em><br>
<p>Well, of course, there is a weak version of free-will, according to
<br>
which we have free will if only we can make decisions independently of
<br>
our genetics and our fellow man, but NOT necessarily independent of,
<br>
say, the state of the Earth yesterday or last week or last year.  I
<br>
must agree with that weaker version.  The strong version states that
<br>
given that the world was exactly the way it was all the way up to the
<br>
point of your decision, you could Decide one thing or the other
<br>
in some non-random non-determined way.  That's what I reject.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I, like you, could choose to trot out a philosophical case different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the one I aesthetically prefer (and find easier to argue) ....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly the move-response format of dialogue (Hegelian dialect)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shapes the argument ... and the only certain course open to win
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chicken/egg type arguments is by trial of strength of the persausive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or hypnotic relative strengths of each party .... it certainly gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us a new option to philosophical logic-chopping. I am not sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the better arguments always win in practice, but often it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stronger Will.
</em><br>
<p>If philosophy one day descends into hypno-wars, I'm bailing.  :)  But
<br>
I largely agree with this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that von Neumann machines &amp; neural nets can often both solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same problems ... and that both ultimately rely on the laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistical mechanics ... but the von Neuman machines ARE determined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more fully since they are fully predictive, whereas the internal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state of neural computers are NOT analysable and discrete ..... the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight state does not translate into particular known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properties. Serial machine emulations are just that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations. They are running a whole bunch of code whilst true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parallel neuro-computers have no code.  They cannot DO real-time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computations .. so how can you even say that they &quot;emulate&quot; real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time computations?
</em><br>
<p>I never said that they did it in real time... they do it considerably
<br>
slower than that.  But doing it at all is interesting.  In
<br>
particular, if you had a slow person who still had REM, still claimed
<br>
to have dreams and told me about them, still told me how they felt,
<br>
still talked to me like an ordinary slow person, I'd be drawn to
<br>
conclude that they were just like me, only slower, including having
<br>
consciousness, only slower, assuming I have it in the first place.
