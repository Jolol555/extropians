<em>&gt;&gt; observation. It could clear up a lot of confusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Just a minute, hold on there! As part of your discussion, you yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mention the &quot;amplitude squared&quot; property of quantum waves, where the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;whatever, this really *does* involve squaring this complex amplitude, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it involves squaring the sum total of any such vectors as may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interfering in a given region of space. This is a situation quite unlike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anything in regular probability theory, something quite different added
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in there, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Say you've got a single photon waveform, and say this wave is travelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through two slits in a single photon, double slit experiment. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probability of the photon hitting a screen is then a kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interference pattern of high and low probabilities as you move across
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the screen. The waveform itself must then actually be a real, extended
</em><br>
<em>&gt;structure of *some* kind, it seems to me, since it directly governs the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probability of finding the photon in the various bands of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interference pattern.
</em><br>
<p><p>In this case, the Bayesian approach is that they are in both states
<br>
at once, as a function of the superposition principle, and we are
<br>
lacking more variables to describe the scenario. If we interpret the
<br>
amplitudes instead, as energies that we are measuring, then the amplitude
<br>
squared is the probability that, if we measure its energy, we shall
<br>
find the value corresponding to the nth state.
<br>
<p>However, I see your confusion. I didn't describe at any length where
<br>
Bayes' Theorem applies in Caticha's work, and indeed, I don't see
<br>
Bayes theorem in his articles. I apologize for that. I know that
<br>
Caticha comes from a Bayes perspective because I met him and we
<br>
spoke at a conference on Bayes applications (MaxEnt'98), and I know
<br>
that his colleague at the conference, C. Rodriguez (see below), also
<br>
researches quantum probabilities from a Bayes perspective.
<br>
<p>The Bayes connection in Caticha's work comes in through his
<br>
references to R.T. Cox, and E. Jaynes, so it would would have more
<br>
accurate for me to say Caticha's subscribes to the &quot;Bayesian
<br>
probability view&quot; that probability as a measure of the plausibility
<br>
of an event with incomplete knowlege (which is different from the
<br>
frequentist or &quot;sampling theory&quot; view that probability as the
<br>
long-run frequency of occurrence of an event in a sequence of
<br>
repeated (sometimes hypothetical) experiment).
<br>
<p>If you read Caticha's papers, you will see that they describe a real
<br>
experiment, so it is physical, and all propositions are testable. No
<br>
statements about the quantum particle can be made independently of
<br>
the experimental context (so you see, &quot;priors&quot; in the Bayesian sense
<br>
must be present). He doesn't separate the particle; describing what
<br>
it is doing between the source and the detector. He cannot say
<br>
whether the particle is a point particle or a wave or both or
<br>
neither. He is not saying that it went through either one hole or
<br>
through another, or through both holes at the same time. He has very
<br>
few assumptions: mostly that the particle is simply capable of being
<br>
emitted and detected.
<br>
<p>So where does Bayes probability ideas come in? Now I go to a paper
<br>
by E.T. Jaynes, titled &quot;Probability in Quantum Theory&quot;, and I pull
<br>
some things from that paper in my description below.
<br>
<p>Much of physical science is information that is organized in
<br>
particular ways. We have a basic question, which is:
<br>
<p>&quot;To what extent does this information reside in us, and to what
<br>
extent is it a property of Nature? Any theory about reality can have
<br>
no consequences testable by us unless it can also describe what
<br>
humans can see and know.&quot; Jaynes says that the proper tool for
<br>
incorporating human information into science is simply probability
<br>
theory or &quot;Bayesian inference&quot;. Probability theory is an extension
<br>
of logic, in order to reason in situations where we have incomplete
<br>
information.
<br>
<p>However, amplitude Psi, according to our usual quantum mechanics
<br>
texts is not now to be interpreted in as expressions of human
<br>
ignorance of the true physical state. Jaynes says that it is our way
<br>
that we interpret the amplitudes that is causing the confusion. The
<br>
probabilities that we seek, must be in terms of mutually exclusive
<br>
possibilities and must be represented in a &quot;deeper hypothesis space&quot;
<br>
that contains more parameters, for example, phases. He doesn't go into
<br>
details of what all other parameters must be included, he mainly points
<br>
that our perspective has to shift into a wider view, and he says
<br>
that we cannot hope to get our probability connections right until we
<br>
get some basic points of logic right.
<br>
<p>For example, this illogical situation:
<br>
<p>Dispersions: (delta F)^2 = &lt;F^2&gt; - &lt;F&gt;^2 are thought by some
<br>
physicists to be quantum fluctuations in F that are *real physical
<br>
events that take place constantly whether or not any measurement is
<br>
being made.*
<br>
<p>In basic probability theory, (delta F) represents fundamentally the
<br>
accuracy with which we are able to predict the value of F. This does
<br>
not deny that it may be also be the variability seen in repeated
<br>
measurements of F; but the point is that they need not be the same.
<br>
To say that they &quot;must be the same&quot; is what Jaynes calls the &quot;Mind
<br>
Projection Fallacy&quot;, which is to suppose that creations of our own
<br>
imagination are real properties of Nature, or that our own ignorance
<br>
signifies some indecision on the part of Nature. If from our
<br>
information, we are able to determine F to only 5 percent accuracy,
<br>
that does not mean that the object fluctuates by 5 percent!
<br>
<p>Jaynes has some interesting things to say in this paper about other
<br>
aspects of quantum mechanics such as the Zero-Point Energy and the
<br>
Lamb shift. and I encourage you to read his works. Much of it is
<br>
available on the Web, mostly here:

<br>
<p>Now back to Caticha.
<br>
<p>Caticha's colleague, C. Rodriguez, a mathematician at SUNY Albany,
<br>
has a paper in the same text as Caticha's
<br>
<p>Caticha, Ariel, _Probability and Entropy in Quantum Theory_ in
<br>
Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Methods_ (conf proceedings from
<br>
MaxEnt'98 conference, Garching, Germany, July 1998), Kluwer Academic
<br>
Publ., 1999.
<br>
<p>titled:
<br>
<p>&quot;Unreal Probabilities&quot;: Partial Truth with Clifford Numbers&quot;. by C.
<br>
Rodriguez.  (starting at pg. 247)
<br>
<p>I will just quote from the beginning of the paper- it's highly
<br>
mathematical, and tough reading, and what follows is a bit abstract,
<br>
but straightforward.
<br>
<p><p>{begin quote}
<br>
Probability theory was given a firm mathematical foundation in 1933,
<br>
when Kolmogorov introduced his axioms. By defining probability as an
<br>
&quot;uninterpreted&quot; special case of a positive measure with total unit
<br>
mass, the subject exploded with new results and found innumerable
<br>
applications, In 1946, Cox showed that the Kolmogorov axioms for
<br>
probability are really theorems that follow from basic desiderata
<br>
about the representation of particl truth with real numbers. We owe
<br>
to Ed Jaynes, to see the importance of Cox's 1946 work. After
<br>
Jaynes, it became clear why the calculus of probability is so
<br>
successful in the real world. Probability works because its axioms
<br>
axiomatize the right thing: partial truth of a logical proposition
<br>
given another. Even more, the rules of probability are unique in the
<br>
sense that any other set of consistent rules can be brought into the
<br>
standard sum and product rules by a change of scale. This is in fact
<br>
Cox's main result and it makes futile the enterprise of looking for
<br>
alternatives to the calculus of normalized real valued
<br>
probabilities. It is only by allowing the partial truth of a
<br>
proposition to be encoded by an object other than a real number in
<br>
the interval [0,1] that we could find alternatives to the standard
<br>
theory of probability.
<br>
<p>We seek to find out what happens when standard probobaility theory
<br>
is modified by relaxing the axiom that the probability of an event
<br>
must be a real number in the interval [0,1]. We show that, by
<br>
allowing the measure of a proposition to take a value in a Clifford
<br>
Algebra, we automatically find the methods of standard quantum
<br>
theory without ever introducing anything specifically related to
<br>
nature itself.
<br>
<p>The main motivation for this article has come from realizing that
<br>
the derivations in Cox still apply if real numbers are replaced by
<br>
complex numbers as the encoders of partial truth. This was first
<br>
mentioned by Youssef and checked in more detail by Caticha, who also
<br>
showed some non-relativistic Quantum theory, as formulated by
<br>
Feynman, is the only consistent calculus of probability amplitudes.
<br>
By measureing propositions with Clifford numbers we automatically
<br>
include the reals, complexes, quaternions, spinors and any
<br>
combinations of them as special cases.
