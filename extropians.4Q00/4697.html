</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; boo-boos), beginning page 508:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To quote from a review of Robert Wright, Non-Zero: The Logic of Human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Destiny by J. Bradford DeLong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/Econ_Articles/Reviews/nonzero.html">http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/Econ_Articles/Reviews/nonzero.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p. 73: &quot;The seminal calculations of the !Kung workday--two
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       or three hours, then party time--have been put to skeptical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       scrutiny and found wanting. The calculators forgot to include
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       time spent processing the food, making spears, and so on. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       now appears that these hunter-gatherers, at least, work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       roughly as hard as horticulturalists.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure the quote is from the reviewer or the book, but I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the lesson is clear: we should be wary of widely spread memes that fit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in well with what seems to be likely but are not firmly supported. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found a lot of references to a short hunter-gatherer workday among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilisation-critical websites, but rather few references to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primary papers and a lot of hints that they were happily quoting each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other to support their views.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I looked through my copy of _Strategies for Survival_ by Michael
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A. Jochim, but I couldn't quite figure out how to convert his tables
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into workdays for the !Kung and other hunter-gatherers.  My guess is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a more likely number than 2 hours is 4-5 hours per day, but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely does not take for example transports into account (which can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a huge timewaster). There seems to be a strong increase in workday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you go from hunting to farming though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>2 hours does seem like very little; they must do something in all that
<br>
excess time, anyway.
<br>
<p>One point about the !Kung is that they are modern day hunter gatherers, in a
<br>
world generally no longer suitable for the practice. The land they are on is
<br>
available because no-one else wants it; compared to the average hunter
<br>
gatherer of the past, they probably live a marginal and much more difficult
<br>
existence.
<br>
<p>I'm not advocating the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, however! Not unless I can
<br>
take a gameboy... and my notebook... and all my other stuff with me. No,
<br>
stuff it.
<br>
<p>This thread has merely been there to question the assumption that technology
<br>
has historically absolutely benefitted the peoples who have adopted it. This
<br>
situation is turning around today, I think, in the west, but that's an
<br>
anomaly (which we need to continue and spread).Maybe the ancient romans had
<br>
a similar situation? I have no idea.
<br>
<p>Note of course that people's relative conditions were always improved by
<br>
technology (comparing to what it would have been like without it), the key
<br>
ingredient being population pressure; as population grew, you either ramped
<br>
up your tech, or died. No doubt from this viewpoint, the average individual
<br>
has always been assisted by rising tech, because that individual would have
<br>
a very low probability of existing at all without it (especially without
<br>
past rises in population which made that individual's  current environment
<br>
possible).
<br>
<p>I like to think that this is quite in keeping with transhumanism. Humans
<br>
have been in a race for survival and expansion over past millenia, and our
<br>
conditions seem generally to have deteriorated with growing numbers. The
<br>
hope is that we may finally be (or soon be) on top of our technology to a
<br>
point where it can do more than keep ever more of us alive in worse overall
<br>
circumstances; maybe it can start to raise absolute standards, in aggregate.
