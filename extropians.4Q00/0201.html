<em>&gt;Subject: MacLeod's Cassini Division
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I read &quot;The Cassini Division&quot; by Ken MacLeod over the weekend.  I couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find any mention of it in the archives at <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though I think I recall some discussion here once.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It was well written (or maybe it had been too long since I'd read SF and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;needed a fix).  People like us are clearly the bad guys in the book, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was interesting to see what our worse crimes are from MacLeod's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perspective.
</em><br>
<p>I'd be cautious about jumping to conclusions.  MacLeod has publicly stated 
<br>
that the only intentional moral in the book is that posthumans should 
<br>
complete their upgrade path before they start to act agressive.
<br>
<p>Certainly different characters have different viewpoints, with any number of 
<br>
characters asserting that the destruction of posthumans is tantamount to 
<br>
genocide.  Even the carbon-chauvanist protagonist comes to agree with that 
<br>
-- even though that doesn't stop her or cause her to mourn.  Certainly, 
<br>
within the framework of the story, the posthuman civ could be construed as a 
<br>
genuine and manifest threat.
<br>
<p>As for the politics, MacLeod likes to play with political alternatives.  In 
<br>
this sequence of stories, he opts to present two anarchic utopians: one 
<br>
socialist and one capitalist.  Overall (having read the first three books), 
<br>
both are construed as viable and interesting for the purposes of the story.
<br>
<p>My complaints about tCD are that MacLeod never really gave a sense of proper 
<br>
magnitude with respect to the destruction of the PH's (I have a similar 
<br>
complaint with respect to the first book in the book in the sequence, The 
<br>
Star Fraction).  An even deeper compaint, however, is that the PHs are 
<br>
rendered thoroughly inept, both in terms of raw power and in terms of 
<br>
foresite, in order for the book to reach its conclusion.  It's galling 
<br>
enough when plots are driven by stupid characters, but a plot point that 
<br>
hinges on stupid and incompetent posthumans (even when they are repeatedly 
<br>
asserted to have godlike intelligence) simply vexes me.  It is a black mark 
<br>
against an otherwise fine novel, IMNSHO.
