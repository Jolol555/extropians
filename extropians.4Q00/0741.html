<em>&gt;J.R.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have no idea what studies you are talking about showing that bisexuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(and I assume you are talking about males here) have more success with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;women! Who does this kind of research?! I must read this! I've known a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;host of bisexuals over the years (I'm 25 at the moment), and know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everything from married bisexuals to somewhat celebate ones. But I seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think that straight men are more into the bisexual women fantasy than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;straight women are into the bisexual men fantasy. Still, I'm totally in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;favor of fantasy and self-constructed selves.... (try to focus this back
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to Extropian issues).

<p>I think it was me who originally made the point that women tend to like gay 
<br>
males. I was not speaking of as sexual partners, and thats why I said gay 
<br>
males rather then bisexual ones. It's been my observation, and I think that 
<br>
most people will have made similar observations, that there are many women 
<br>
(more then would be accounted for by chance) who have an inordinate number 
<br>
of friends who are gay males. I'd assume that this is based on something in 
<br>
their personality that they like, rather then an attempt to fullfill sexual 
<br>
fantasy. I was saying this to explain something I'd read that said women who 
<br>
identify themselves as lesbians have had more male sexual partners then 
<br>
women who identify themselves as straight have had, and that I read read 
<br>
that men who identify themselves as gay have had a high number of female 
<br>
sexual partners as well. I read this in a journal called &quot;deviant behavior&quot; 
<br>
(it was.. for a class) and the study was dated in the 1980s. The link I was 
<br>
assuming was that if you're friends with someone, you're more likely to have 
<br>
sex, and I was suggesting this as a possible evolutionary strategy for 
<br>
homosexuality - although it's pretty Rube Goldberg. There's other 
<br>
explanations for why some women have many gay friends - maybe a gay guy is 
<br>
just more likely to come out to a female friend, or that a straight guy 
<br>
would be less likely to talk about &quot;my gay friend bob&quot;.
