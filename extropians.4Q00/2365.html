<p>However, because NH's population is only 1.2 million, in a relatively small but
<br>
variable geographic area (~80 miles wide by ~250 tall), with only a handful of
<br>
TV stations, any candidate with a few hundred thousand bucks can gain
<br>
significant exposure early on (and because many other areas of the country are
<br>
watching via TV news, those candidates get lots of free exposure nationwide,
<br>
rather than having to pay for it). Failing to do this limits your choices in
<br>
Illinois as well as ours, because having primaries all the same day guarrantees
<br>
that only one or two candidates could cough up the funds to compete at that
<br>
level, at most. If that system had been in place last year, there would have
<br>
been no need of a primary, as only Bush would have had the funds to get exposure
<br>
in every state. Starting in smaller states first allows candidates that are not
<br>
bought and paid for by the multinationals to gain exposure and gives people real
<br>
choice.
