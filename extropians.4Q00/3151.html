<em>&gt; Modern technology, believe it or not.  The keywords you want are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;intertially contained fusion&quot;: basically, keeping a plasma contained at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the center of a (spherical, usually) shell.  They're still working on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;fusion&quot; part, granted, but people have contained plasmas this way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before.  This would appear to be that, just on a much larger scale.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, Daimler-Chrysler is involved in inertial electrostatic
<br>
containment fusion research, and there are functioning desktop reactors
<br>
that DO, in fact, have fusion reactions. Just not an over unity level of
<br>
reactions, so all they are good for is for neutron sources, not as an
<br>
energy source. This method was pioneered 30+ years ago by one of the
<br>
inventors of TV.
<br>
<p>Since a dyson sphere or niven ring would orbit at a velocity higher than
<br>
orbital velocity, in order to produce a 1 g centrifugal gravity
<br>
simulation, it is likely that the radial velocity differential between
<br>
it and the solar corona would create its own magnetic field that might
<br>
be used to stabilize the ring or sphere much as a magnetic bearing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; One last note.  Though the 800 lb gorilla appears neutral in this matter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that's only first order effects.  Second order gravitational effects may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; come into play.  If the non-uniform heating of one side of the sphere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; causes it to distort, or tidal forces cause it to distort, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gravitational forces may again come into play.  The devil's in the details.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even with an undistorted sphere, would the pull of gravity not be larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the point of the sphere closest to the star's center than on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite point?  This would seem to be the biggest argument for keeping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the star centered (so there is no poin substantially closer to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; center).  Also, in practice, it may be desirable to support spheres with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-uniform mass distribution - say, for docking large spaceships, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for manufacturing, or for sentients residing in a similar fashion as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentients on the surface of the Earth today (that is, clustering in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cities, migrating, et cetera) - though this may be best handled by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figuring the current center of mass and moving the star there with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect to the sphere.
</em><br>
<p>So long as this instability can be kept resonant as a standing wave, I
<br>
should think it would not be a real problem. The problem is if the wave
<br>
continuously builds on itself, like the Tacoma Narrows bridge. Solar
<br>
flares would cause perturbations, of course, and no other planets could
<br>
be allowed in the system either. Note that such a ring or sphere would
<br>
in fact need some type of active system to make corrections, which even
<br>
the cloud methodology requires to minimize fragmentation.
