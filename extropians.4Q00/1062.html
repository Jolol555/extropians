<p>The whole point of slashboxes is so you *don't* have to do that. You
<br>
can see the RDF headlines from potentially any RDF enabled site right
<br>
there on the main page, and every Slash site is by default RDF
<br>
enabled. 
<br>
<p>Furthermore, how is the situation any different for email lists? I
<br>
have to subscribe to all of them and get my limited disk space filled
<br>
up with postings on a daily basis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * not to mention have to succumb to limited design and presentation

</em><br>
<p>Please direct your comments at how ExtroDot specifically can improve. I
<br>
couldn't care less about the shortcomings of other, lesser, Slash
<br>
clones. We have no frogs in blenders, java shooters, dancing hampsters,
<br>
or for that matter any webmonkeys that are in any sense average.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * No, I don't want to see more ads, and volunteer marketers behaviour
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   data, so that get more targeted spam 
</em><br>
<p>Ditto. Have you even bothered to look at the Extrodot site? 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; * unless I run a tweaked squid and have essentially infinite drive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   space I don't have that information stored. Not so with hypermailed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   and full-text indexed inboxes, these are much easier on drive space
</em><br>
<p>Huh? Extodot sits on *our* drivespace, not yours. Unless you choose
<br>
to save a particular posting or article locally. It's *more* efficient
<br>
on disk space. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; * I usually have about 100 browser windows open, which have lots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   state in them. Sooner or later the whole shebang crashes, resulting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   in me producing weird muffled noises and wanting to strangle Netscape 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   programmers. All of them.
</em><br>
<p>Your misconfigured browser and your misconfigured computer is no more
<br>
ExtroDot's problem than your misconfigured email client or sendmail
<br>
server is <a href="mailto:extropians@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20A%20plea%20for%20restraint&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.GSO.4.21.0010130843430.18840-100000@jane.itd.umich.edu&gt;">extropians@extropy.org</a>'s problem.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; * Browsers not only crash, they eat memory like crazy for each page
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   rendered. And, yeah, memory leaks. Lots of them. Comes with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   braindead programmers trying to render complex content specified 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   in a braindead language transported by braindead protocols
</em><br>
<p>Which is why none of this list's readers use web browsers. Oops, I
<br>
should have known this World Wide Web thing would never catch on.
<br>
<p>Hey, if your VAX or whatever it is doesn't have enough memory to run
<br>
a GUI browser, ExtroDot will work just fine with Lynx. I've tested it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * slash(hash, dash, mash)dots do everything server-side, which does
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   not allow me with to engage my proven idjit filter (notice that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   even low grade morons can click, but it takes at least an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   imbecile to set up a mail configuration, and subcribe to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   push medium. Also, the overhead usually prevents said idjits to fire 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   up their insightful one-liners)
</em><br>
<p>Finally you're getting to a rational criticism. You should have started
<br>
with this point in the first place. Tell me more about your filters.
<br>
They may already exist as features, or they may be relatively easy to
<br>
implement.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; * I can go on, but this really proves web is totally broken
</em><br>
<p>No it doesn't. Please, do go on.
<br>
<p>Eugene, I apologize for the sarcastic tone of this message. I have the
<br>
utmost respect for you, but I get as irritated by junk logic as you
<br>
do. To the rest of you-- you won't get the Eugene treatment; please
<br>
don't be afraid to speak up. Eugene is a special case because I know he
<br>
knows better.
<br>
<p>I leave everybody with this question to ponder:
<br>
<p>Is there an inherent difference between push and pull media, or is this
<br>
difference arbitrary, artifactual, and potentially transparent to the
<br>
user in the same way as &quot;static location vs. search query&quot; or &quot;local
<br>
volume vs. distributed file system&quot;?
