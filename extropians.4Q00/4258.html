<em>&gt;New York Times, John Markoff, December 29, 1988:
</em><br>
_________________________________________________________________
<br>
<em>&gt;Computer scientists and Government officials are urging the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creation of a nationwide &quot;data superhighway&quot; that they believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would have a dramatic economic impact, rivaling that of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nation's interstate highway system.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;This highway would consist of a high-speed fiber-optic data
</em><br>
<em>&gt;network joining dozens of supercomputers at national laboratories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and making them available to thousands of academic and industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;researchers around the country ...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Legislation introduced in October by Senator Albert Gore, Democrat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Tennessee, included initial financing for development and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;construction of a National Research Network. Backers of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;measure say that Federal financing for the project is necessary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;develop the technology and convince industry that vastly speedier
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computer networks are commercially viable.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, the &quot;Information Superhighway&quot; it was never built.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The Houston Chronicle, &quot;Data superhighway' for nation's computers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;approved by Congress&quot;, November 30, 1991:
</em><br>
_________________________________________________________________
<br>
<em>&gt;A plan to create a high-tech &quot;data superhighway&quot; likened in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;importance to the creation of the nation's highway system has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;approved by Congress and sent to President Bush for his signature.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The plan would create a high-speed national computer networking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infrastructure that would link computers in the nation's research,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education and military establishments.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Proponents say that this network eventually will evolve into a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;universally available National Public Telecomputing Network that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may be the successor to the telephone system, marrying the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entertainment, communications and computer industries.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991, which contains the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plan, was approved by a House-Senate conference committee over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weekend after being stalled for several weeks because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disagreement over a &quot;buy American first&quot; provision.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The bill, sponsored by Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., does not provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;funding for the effort. Budget allocations and appropriations must
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be made individually during each year of the program.
</em><br>
<p><p>The Internet was well established by this time. Note that my
<br>
current Internet address, <a href="mailto:talon57@well.com?Subject=Re:%20Clarification%20and%20limited%20apology.&In-Reply-To=&lt;200012182202.OAA06236@well.com&gt;">talon57@well.com</a>, is over two years old
<br>
at this point, I, a non-government, non-university person had been
<br>
on the Internet for over two years with my current address.

<p><p><p><em>&gt;Time Magazine interview with Vint Cerf, inventor of the Internet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Protocol, June 14, 2000:
</em><br>
_________________________________________________________________

<br>
<em>&gt;Timehost: Welcome to the TIME auditorium. We're thrilled to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as our guest Vinton Cerf, one of the inventors of the Internet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mr. Cerf has just written an article for TIME magazine, in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he says that the Internet will be everywhere. Even, literally, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our bodies! So send in your questions about the past, present and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future of the Internet. Who better to answer those questions than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the man who  invented the Internet? (Sorry, Al Gore)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Timehost: Mr. Cerf is now with us. Welcome!
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Vinton Cerf: Good evening, or whatever time zone you are in, hi!! 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;While we're waiting for questions, I'd like to clear up one little 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;item - about the Vice President ... He really does deserve some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;credit for his early recognition of the importance of the Internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the technology that makes it work. He was certainly among the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;first if not the first in Congress to realize how powerful the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information revolution would be and both as Senator and Vice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;President he has been enormously helpful in supporting legislation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and programs to help further develop the Internet - for example 
</em><br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<em>&gt;the Next Generation Internet program. I get to see a lot of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stuff because I am a member of the President's Information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Technology Advisory Committee and we regularly review the R&amp;D
</em><br>
<em>&gt;programs of the US Government and many have relevance to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolving Internet.
</em><br>
<p>Some credit, yes, he was one of many who appreciated the Internet
<br>
early. This is a far cry from what both he and his supporters claim
<br>
however.
<br>
<p>Lets not forget his other accomplishments, the digital telephony
<br>
act that put a government backdoor in every telephone central
<br>
office and the infamous Clipper chip, not to mention trying to
<br>
throw Phil Zimmerman in jail.....
