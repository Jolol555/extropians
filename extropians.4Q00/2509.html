</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. John Horgan's predictions regarding the end of scientific progress will

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. All these precautions and ideas for programming an ethical AI fail, and
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; little more than tools or servants.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm.  That looks pretty bad, no doubt of that.  Of course, under
<br>
those circumstances, there's no WAY we're going to make it.
<br>
<p>In that case, our only hope for our civilization to survive is to get
<br>
out into space; once we do that, we've done pretty much all we can.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Resource depletion will occur in my lifetime- the Earth being swallowed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sun will not.
</em><br>
<p>You're wrong about that.  Dying in a large scale war?  Possible.
<br>
Wacky diseases?  Could be.  Other unpredictable causes of death?  It
<br>
happens.
<br>
<p>But *resource depletion* will not happen during your lifetime.
<br>
<p>Understand what it would require in order for total resource depletion
<br>
to take place.
<br>
<p>Beforehand, all of our energy resources would gradually grow scarce.
<br>
Oil wells, for example, don't dry up all of a sudden.  They start
<br>
pumping less and less oil until eventually they run out.
<br>
<p>This means that the price of oil will gradually rise.  (Even though,
<br>
for now, it's falling, in the long term.)
<br>
<p>Now consider various energy alternatives, which are more expensive
<br>
than oil.  No one uses them right now.  They're too expensive.  But if
<br>
the price of oil were to rise above the price of those, we'd start
<br>
using those.  All of those would have to run out.
<br>
<p>Consider, as well, various energy alternatives which we could develop
<br>
by throwing a lot of money at the problem, including more efficient
<br>
solar energy, geothermal energy, wind energy, safer nuclear energy,
<br>
and the energy we can access by mining off-planet, dropping things
<br>
into black holes, building large solar panels on the far side of the
<br>
sun (or other nearby stars), etc.  No one invests in these
<br>
technologies very much right now, because oil is so cheap.  If the
<br>
price of oil were to rise, however, the relative price of investing in
<br>
these technologies would fall.  That would lead the market to invest
<br>
in these more.  As energy became more scarce, we'd invest more and
<br>
more in these technologies until they began to pay off.
<br>
<p>And, obviously, they *would* pay off (some of them, at least).
<br>
There's lots of energy out there in the galaxy, and if we have to pay
<br>
to get it, we will.  For this not to happen, capitalists, investment
<br>
bankers in particular, would have to pass up more profitable
<br>
alternatives, en masse.  This will NEVER happen.
<br>
<p>Julian Simon has argued, (rightly, I think,) that we'll never run out
<br>
of oil, because the price of extracting the last however-many-billions
<br>
of gallons of oil from the earth's crust will remain too high,
<br>
relative to the cost of alternative forms of energy, for us to bother.
<br>
<p>Not to mention the fact that our oil reserves may, in fact, be
<br>
refilling themselves, if you take Thomas Gold seriously.  Of course,
<br>
that would only mean that the Earth has hundreds of times more oil
<br>
potential than even the most optimistic geologists might guess, only
<br>
enough to last thousands of years; so, I suppose, we could still run
<br>
out eventually.
<br>
<p>But, again, you'd be wrong to imagine that the earth will run out of
<br>
oil and that only THEN will we look for more energy, like you and I do
<br>
when we run out of laundry.  The process is gradual, as oil gradually
<br>
rises in price and alternative fuel sources gradually look more and
<br>
more profitable.
<br>
<p>So, assuming we don't die by some other means (a big assumption),
<br>
resource depletion is NOT your problem.  We're much more likely to
<br>
ruin the earth in a hundred other ways than run out of resources.  We
<br>
have to focus on the REAL threats, including real threats to the
<br>
environment; let those wily capitalists figure out how to keep the
<br>
party going.  (They're the ones with the most to gain, and the most to
<br>
lose.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My father is a multimillionaire, I attend a private college, I own an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive computer, expensive clothing, etc. etc.  Yet for some reason, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel incomplete.  I'm frequently depressed (I've been to two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychotherapists- both say I'm fine and that I don't need medication), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no matter how much I study, my life just feels more insignificant and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointless.  Yet, at the same time, I see many people with far less material
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth than I that seem far more satisfied, happy, and purposeful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; * [The noble savage is not a myth, but he's hardly the norm.  Spare me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your hamlet of paradise story; *most* hamlets are hellholes.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've never been a believer in the idea of the &quot;Noble Savage&quot;.  I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that any utopian political philosophy, whether it's that of Rousseau, Marx,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or Rand, can only lead to disaster.
</em><br>
<p>Well, of course, I must point out that you're looking at a rich
<br>
depressed person, you, all the time, and that the happy poor, like
<br>
boxcar 6s, are more visible than the hopeless ones.  So you may not be
<br>
observing a representative sample.
<br>
<p>At any rate, I agreed that the connection between happiness and wealth
<br>
is weak.  It still holds, by and large, [I've yet to hear anyone
<br>
assert that we ought to make the poor happier by making them poorer!]
<br>
but no one will doubt that you can show me some happy hamlets and
<br>
miserable millionaires.  They're just not the norm.
<br>
<p>Wealth makes life better, but not perfect, or even good, necessarily.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; True enough.  But tell me, what is art?
</em><br>
<p>Heh.  NO, I refuse.  ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you deny spirituality, you've pretty much dissolved any meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the artistic experience.
</em><br>
<p>Well, of course, you'd be going too far if you said that nobody can
<br>
ever find meaning without spirituality.  I assert that, here at least,
<br>
you're surrounded by purposeful happy atheists.  Some of us even have
<br>
an appreciation for art.  Most of us have found (or made!) meaning in
<br>
our lives.  Make of that what you will.
<br>
<p>Personally, I'm a pragmatist.  My answer to those who talk of
<br>
spirituality is the same Laplace gave to Emperor Napoleon, when His
<br>
Grace asked Laplace why his astronomy did not include any mention of
<br>
God.  &quot;Sire,&quot; he supposedly replied, &quot;I have no need of that
<br>
hypothesis.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, maybe I'm wrong about that.  Maybe I DO have a need of that
<br>
hypothesis that I've overlooked.  Or maybe I'm right about me, but
<br>
wrong in thinking that *most* people don't need that hypothesis.
<br>
(Maybe people like me are special.)  Or maybe I'm even right about
<br>
most people, but wrong about artists.  All this would surprise me, but
<br>
I've been deeply surprised like that before.
<br>
<p>Still, one doesn't have to get spiritual to find some external
<br>
overrinding force to guide one's life.  Take Truth, for example,
<br>
and/or Beauty.  They don't require any formally spiritual entity.
<br>
Truth can just be all the true ideas, and Beauty can be all and only
<br>
the most beautiful things, without any need to call upon spiritual
<br>
entities.
<br>
<p>Or you could commit yourself to the happiness of the people.  Or to
<br>
Democracy.  Or Freedom.  We all know how much high quality stuff has
<br>
come on the table in the name of Freedom.
<br>
<p>Remember those postmodernists?  Post-Nietzschean existentialists,
<br>
mostly.  No spirituality, no god, just us, just you and I, engaging
<br>
with the art.  I find the picture heroic.  Maybe even Romantic.  Or
<br>
bathetic, which can be quixotically heroic, sort of. ;)
<br>
<p>Alternately, you can make it your goal in life to figure out what the
<br>
real goal is.  (Call that your Interim Goal; see if it leads you
<br>
anywhere.)
<br>
<p>But, if you can't stand any of those, you can always be a
<br>
spiritualist.  We extropians, along with many others, are committed to
<br>
your freedom to believe whatever you want (or, more sensibly, whatever
<br>
makes sense to you).  We *think* that we're right, but it might turn
<br>
out that there just have to be some people who think that we're wrong
<br>
in order for society to work right.
<br>
<p>So, how can art survive Singularity?  I wouldn't worry about it.
<br>
Instead, worry about how it can survive the Earth, and what we're
<br>
doing to it (or just about to do to it).
<br>
<p>It's doomed, after all.
