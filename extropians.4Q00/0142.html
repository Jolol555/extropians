<p><em>&gt;&quot;The Cassini Division&quot; by Ken MacLeod 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;People like us are clearly the bad guys in the book, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was interesting to see what our worse crimes are from MacLeod's perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;MacLeod seems to favor some sort of socialist society, though he was never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very clear how it worked.  He is, however, able to depict an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anarcho-capitalist society, and it isn't a terrible place 
</em><br>
<p>The problem here is that you can't really evaluate McLeod's perspective
<br>
(assuming he has just one) on the basis of this novel alone. THE CASSINI
<br>
DIVISION is part of a 4-volume construct (to date), which opens with THE
<br>
STAR FRACTION. THE STONE CANAL is a complement to CASSINI. The most recent
<br>
book, THE SKY ROAD, rescinds part of that history and re-runs it.
<br>
<p>His fiction is notable for its Realpolitik, and for its use of a
<br>
left-anarchist alternative to extropian-style projections. I find it
<br>
congenial.
<br>
<p>Here're some more thoughts from my new book TRANSREALIST FICTION:
<br>
<p>============
<br>
<p>MacLeod, Ken. *The Star Fraction*. London: Legend, 1995.
<br>
----  *The Stone Canal*. London: Legend, 1996. 
<br>
----  *The Cassini Division*. London: Orbit, 1998.
<br>
----  *The Sky Road*. London: Orbit, 1999.
<br>
<p>&lt; 	An audacious Marxist (or perhaps post-marxist) version of a world going
<br>
through, recovering from, and absorbing a Singularity has been sketched by
<br>
Ken MacLeod, like Iain M. Banks a Scots writer with affinities to the
<br>
anarchist left. These novels began with *The Star Fraction* (1995), which
<br>
nearly won the Arthur C. Clarke award, a kind of frenzied Trotskyist vision
<br>
of a world convulsed by political fractions and manipulated by an emergent
<br>
AI weapons system. Subsequent volumes explore a variety of future cultures
<br>
that might emerge from this abrupt discontinuity. *The Sky Road* (1999)
<br>
actually revises the future history of the other three, ensuring that a
<br>
menacing Spike does *not* occur, or at least is delayed. *The Stone Canal*
<br>
(1996) and its sequel *The Cassini Division* (1998) portray with high, sly
<br>
humor and impressive technical and political insight two contesting
<br>
utopias, one a Banksian anarchosocialist Union on a damaged Earth, the
<br>
other an anarchocapitalist libertarian world on the far side of a wormhole,
<br>
10,000 light years from Earth and in its future. Both alternative regimes
<br>
(or anti-regimes) are thus at arms-length yet able to communicate and even
<br>
visit. Jupiter, meanwhile, has been redesigned by posthuman entities, the
<br>
`fast folk', that blend organic roots and AI enhancements. Are they
<br>
dreadfully dangerous - trapped in psychotic virtual realities, but likely
<br>
to emerge at any moment - or should they be welcomed as our successors?
<br>
MacLeod is superbly sardonic in setting all these groups at each other's
<br>
throats and minds. His vision of a Singularity is distinctly unnerving, and
<br>
his several contrasted utopias are no less troubling even as they seduce us
<br>
in succession. &gt;
