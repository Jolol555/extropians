</em><br>
<p>I agree with some of this, BUT the same is true of new businesses and
<br>
inventions in general.  Many or most fail.  A few survive.  The particularly
<br>
vexing problem in the space industry is that there are several, heavily
<br>
government funded space agencies out there absorbing most of the launch
<br>
dollars.  If these ceased operation, I bet we would have more private launch
<br>
companies.
<br>
<p>However, that said, Sea Launch, a public-private venture funded by some big
<br>
names in the aerospace industry, has had successful launches.  (See
<br>
<a href="http://www.sea-launch.com/">http://www.sea-launch.com/</a>)  However, unlike Roton, conventional launch
<br>
technology is being used.  Yeah, the launch pad -- onboard a ship -- is
<br>
unconventional -- though many captured V2 rockets were launched at sea --
<br>
but their main launch vehicle is not.
<br>
<p>I think this is more in line with the kind of thinking a private launch
<br>
company needs.  I.e., off-the-shelf technology.  On this list previously,
<br>
I've even championed the idea of just using old Saturn V designs for a heavy
<br>
launch vehicle.  Surely, the patents have expired, though others have
<br>
brought up documentation problems, so it might not be practical.  Still, why
<br>
stick to Saturns.  There are old Titans, Atlases, and the like.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For myself, at least, I've think I've finally gotten to the point that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't be fooled again.  The technology just hasn't gotten to the point
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; private venture investment can make a go of it.  There aren't any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intermediate steps to orbit to establish an incremental approach that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smaller, private ventures can build on one step at a time: The initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threshold of success is just too high.
</em><br>
<p>Not so!  One can get into related technologies and support services.  Much
<br>
of this area is already done by private firms.  NASA, e.g., doesn't build
<br>
rockets.  Private companies build them for it.
<br>
<p>Also, there is a small market for sounding rockets and the like.
<br>
<p>And why not take something along the lines of the X-15 or SR-71 and make it
<br>
into an expensive thrill ride or even a suborbital spacecraft or satelite
<br>
launcher?  (One company was taking an approach like this by launching from
<br>
under the belly of B-52s.  I don't recall its name or the success, though I
<br>
think it was focused on the military launch market.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Until material and manufacturing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology get to the point where a relatively small group of people can
</em><br>
make
<br>
<em>&gt; a go of it n one relatively short push from start to finish, I think space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access will continue to be the domain of governments and huge
</em><br>
institutions.
<br>
<p>I won't deny that, though not just because of plain old market barriers to
<br>
entry, but because of the above reasons I noted above: government space
<br>
agencies subsidize launches.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
