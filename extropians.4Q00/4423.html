<p>But if the phantom eye is a feeling, a mental object, then you're no

the physical world is related to these mental objects!&quot; if you reply:

<p><em>&gt; &gt;Brains *cannot* act independently of chemical stimuli.

</em><br>

<em>&gt; The brain of one person will react in response to suggestions

</em><br>
<p>My error.  I was interpreting &quot;chemical&quot; to include physical stimuli
<br>
as well, without telling you.  Anyway, the point stands that the brain
<br>
cannot act independently from its external physical stimuli; that it
<br>
is entirely determined by them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;They are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;purely physical objects, with no more independence from the world than
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt;determined.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we were, then we could not experience internal light with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside reference or causal source.
</em><br>
<p>You're relying on the philosophical parts of MVT to defend this claim;
<br>
these are the very points which I reject.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am rather insulted that you compare me (and everybody else) with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lumps of rock.
</em><br>
<p>People were offended when they were compared with apes.  But the
<br>
analogy is apt.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;How do you &quot;generate&quot; a non-existent entity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But psychological entities do exist ....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I take note that you have deleted my points about holes, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your schema fails to cope with, so I repeat:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip your lengthy point about holes]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you deal with holes (distinct from GAPS, which depend on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fact that there was ONCE something present but no longer, whereas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hole might be integral)?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I cut them out because I agreed with them.  My response to this
<br>
was that it is *just* as mysterious how *existing* physical objects
<br>
could cause conscious experience as it is that *non-existing* physical
<br>
objects could cause conscious experience.
<br>
<p>&quot;NO!&quot; you say.  &quot;It solves the Leibniz objection!&quot;  No, it doesn't.
<br>
See, non-physical objects can't move physical objects around, and they
<br>
CAN'T MOVE HOLES AROUND EITHER.  They can't in any way affect the size
<br>
or shape of holes; to do so, they'd have to move the *stuff* near the
<br>
holes, which, you concede, is impossible.  Neither does it help us to
<br>
say that the *holes* cause consciousness.  Because, while you can show
<br>
that the holes are necessary for conscious behavior, you can't show me
<br>
how the *holes* can affect the non-physical world, either.  You just
<br>
say that they DO affect the non-physical world, but you *don't* say
<br>
how *holes* can do that.
<br>
<p>You can say: &quot;Listen, not-having a median eye causes consciousness
<br>
reports, and other intelligent behavior.&quot;  And I say, great!  This is
<br>
fantastic news.  That's MVT'.  But then you go on to say: &quot;What's
<br>
more, not-having a median eye causes consciousness itself!&quot; and I say:
<br>
How can you possibly prove that?
<br>
<p>I deal with holes by noting that they have no more explanatory force
<br>
than non-holes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Brains are like Turing machines in that they are composed entirely of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;simple physical parts that do simple physical things.  These physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;parts move deterministically in lock-step.  (Though, to qualify this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;view, I'm a fan of many-worlds.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What parts of the brain &quot;move?&quot; ... 
</em><br>
<p>Neurotransmitters flushing about in your synapses, along with ions
<br>
pumping through your membranes, allows electro-chemical signals to be
<br>
sent throughout the brain and down your axons to your muscles, glands,
<br>
and other parts of your body.  These are the brain's &quot;moving parts.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the dualist problem has been described
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precisely that the pineal gland (or any brain part) cannot be &quot;moved&quot; as,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say, a hand can be moved.
</em><br>
<p>Right.  Those neurotransmitters move around only on account of other
<br>
physical phenomena pushing them about, via diffusion, chemical
<br>
reaction, protein restructuring, etc.  All physical all the time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, the point with parallel computing is that things happen in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PARALLEL, not in serial lockstep.
</em><br>
<p>True, but this can be emulated by a Turing machine: in a given quantum
<br>
of time, it updates the first part, then the second part, then the
<br>
third part, ... and finally the Nth part.  Then it updates the next
<br>
quantum of time, etc.  Thus a Turing machine is functionally
<br>
equivalent to any parallel machine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Moreover, the physical world is causally closed.  Nothing non-physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;interacts with the brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See the verbal cue example above.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but verbal cues, while they aren't *chemical*, are entirely
<br>
*physical*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, nothing non-physical interacts with the PHYSICAL bits of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain, but thoughts (dreams, and other non-physical stuff) can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interact with the NON-physical gap in the brain. Consciousness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the infinite-state feedback loop between the brain and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment made possible because the brain expects to receive data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a peripheral sensor that has gone missing.
</em><br>
<p>Right.  So: a red-wavelength beam of light hits my eye.  It hits
<br>
red-receptors in my eye, which send electrochemical signals up to the
<br>
brain.  How does this signal make me have the conscious sensation of
<br>
red?  All I can see it doing is causing more physical activity in the
<br>
brain.  The fact that there's no medial eye there doesn't seem to help
<br>
this explanation out.
<br>
<p>Similarly, suppose my consciousness has made a decision.  It wants to
<br>
send a message down to my hand to type the word &quot;red&quot;.  How does this
<br>
signal get to my brain?  Once again, the fact that there's no pineal
<br>
eye doesn't answer the question.  And, not coincidentally, no signal
<br>
from my consciousness is necessary: my brain seems to be doing all the
<br>
work *already*: that signal from my eye triggered a purely physical
<br>
complex system, which sent the message back down to my hand to write
<br>
the word &quot;red.&quot;  How did the consciousness help this process?  Once
<br>
again, the non-existence of the eye doesn't help.
<br>
<p>Let me predict an answer: &quot;the holes are in just the right places and
<br>
in just the right shape such that they were intimately involved in
<br>
both physical systems!  The non-existence of the pineal eye explains
<br>
why you wrote the word 'red'; what's more, that 'red' signal passed
<br>
right through where the pineal eye would have been!'  You're sure
<br>
right about that.  But all this is part of MVT', the part of MVT
<br>
that makes only scintifically verifiable statements.
<br>
<p>What you didn't explain is what the holes have to do with
<br>
*consciousness*.  Why does the fact that the pineal eye
<br>
would-have-been there imply that your conscious mind had a
<br>
*sensation*?  How did your conscious decision get the holes into the
<br>
right places?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;How do you &quot;generate&quot; a non-existent entity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By &quot;generate&quot; a phantom eye, I don't imply any active processes, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is more like coins rolling down a ramp and falling into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correctly sized holes, giving the appearance of intelligently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sorting coins into piles. The pathways to and from the old median
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eye (which predate even the visual cortex) expect that data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; travelling along them is from the outside world, whereas in E-1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animals it is not! That is why I think consciousness is a trick of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature.
</em><br>
<p>Conscious behavior IS a trick of nature.  But what about consciousness?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Your tests establish a physical causal link
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;between the real pineal eye and a lack of intelligent behaviour.  As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the eye goes away, assuming you're right about this, intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;behaviour begins to flourish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I find it hard to agree with your Epiphenomenalist assumption that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything that has happened in the universe to date would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened in exactly the same way if no animal had ever been even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remotely aware of anything, and that we are robots following out a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavioural script. This is not my experience.
</em><br>
<p>This is like replying to the claim that the earth spins and revolves
<br>
around the sun with the claim &quot;this is not my experience.&quot;  From here,
<br>
it looks the same either way!  It looks the same whether the sun goes
<br>
around the earth or whether the earth goes around the sun.  Only when
<br>
we attempt to do some scientific inquiry does the correct view come to
<br>
the foreground.
<br>
<p>Similarly, from the inside, it looks the same whether you're making
<br>
decisions or whether you're acting on externally determined desires.
<br>
Indeed, I argue that you've been externally determined to believe that
<br>
your desires are internally determined.  But when we do some science
<br>
we see that only physical elements are at work, and that non-physical
<br>
elements play no role in the way we behave.
<br>
<p>&quot;Look and see!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;No.  We will find structural behavioral analogs, but we will never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;figure out why we see anything at all.  We'll be able to figure out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;*when* we see something, but not how.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you seem to agree with McGinn ... a very defeatist stance, and very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unextropian! You haven't managed to answer my point against this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, and I repeat since you avoid answering here:
</em><br>
<p>It's only &quot;defeatism&quot; if you're giving up on the possible.  Is Godel's
<br>
Incompleteness Proof pessimistic about the possibility of designing a
<br>
formally complete arithmetic?  No.  It shows that it's impossible.
<br>
Every optimist should accept &quot;defeatist&quot; arguments of that kind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; S&gt; Perhaps I should develop new and irresistible hypnotic applications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; from MVT and enforce belief in it ... would this satisfy you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This example was deliberately crafted because it underlines the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-eminence of consciousness ... and goes against epiphenomenalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you answer this method of &quot;proving&quot; MVT?
</em><br>
<p>MVT' may well have some useful applications.  You would not prove MVT,
<br>
but only MVT'.  You still would not show how holes affect
<br>
consciousness, and would not have shown that consciousness can affect
<br>
holes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I fully intend to pull the turf away from under your feet! &quot;Philosophy&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (love of argument) cannot be roped off and protected in the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would like ... weasel words cannot stop the march of progress.
</em><br>
<p>Progress can march on.  Why, if we never talked about consciousness
<br>
ever again, we'd lose nothing at all.  Intelligence is all that
<br>
matters.  Consciousness is a joke.
<br>
<p>Why progress towards an understanding of a stupid word that
<br>
philosophers made up?  Why not grant that they made it up so as to
<br>
keep you from leaving them out of a job?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I don't accept your notion of MVT' ... because knowledge is seamless.
</em><br>
<p>No, claims can be analyzed into parts.  MVT is a compound claim about
<br>
observable facts and unobservable facts.  I accept MVT's observable
<br>
claims and reject MVT's unobservable claims.
<br>
<p>Suppose someone argued for the Fairy theory of physics.  The Fairy
<br>
theory of physics is exactly like our own modern theory of physics,
<br>
except that it insists that each time two objects come under force,
<br>
two undetectable fairies come by and dance on each one, then promptly
<br>
vanish.
<br>
<p>You'd say: &quot;No, the Fairy theory is stupid.  I accept all the bits
<br>
about observable stuff but reject the bit about fairies dancing on the
<br>
particles.&quot;
<br>
<p>What would you think of me if I said: &quot;I don't accept that notion
<br>
... because knowledge is seamless!&quot;
<br>
<p>That's what I think of your rejection of MVT' on those grounds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The mind-body problem ... only like can interact with like, therefore how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does the (observable) brain manifest (non-observable) mentation .... can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be dissolved by the MVT explanation in terms of a illusionary sense-organ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is nevertheless continuous (even supervenient, in Jaegwon Kim's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mereological sense of this silly word, perhaps) with the brain matrix.
</em><br>
<p>No.  You don't explain how consciousness can interact with holes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An illusionary body part can deals with the illusionary world of conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events.
</em><br>
<p>The illisionary body part isn't there *at all*.  You have &quot;dealt with&quot;
<br>
the world of consciousness only if you argue that &quot;like affects like:&quot;
<br>
that the world of consciousness can interact with non-existent objects
<br>
because consciousness doesn't exist in the first place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;It uses a different algorithm from the one Kasparov uses.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Kasparov uses an algorithm too.  (His is certainly better, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hard to read off from the neurons, and ever trickier to program.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The human player tends to use entirely different approaches, Casablanca
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for example said that he only ever looked one move ahead, &quot;but the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; move!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but his nerves did the rest, unconsciously.  I rarely think very
<br>
hard about breathing, but it's rather complex.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, you haven't explained away the programmers needed for Deep Blue ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kasparov can modify whatever heuristics he uses as a result of feedback from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcomes, but bugs in Deep Blue needs programmers .... homunculi.
</em><br>
<p>I'm saying that it's a coincidence that programmers were needed to
<br>
program Deep Blue while none were needed for Kasparov.  Deep Blue was
<br>
designed by people.  Kasparov looks designed because he evolved.  Deep
<br>
Blue could have evolved, if the evolutionary pressures went the right
<br>
way, but they didn't, so we got us instead.
<br>
<p>What more do you need?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Will get round to dealing with your other points when I have more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time.  But to date, nothing you have said convinces me much. Why do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you bother to plow a trough which you think is sterile and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointless? Science can throw up new solutions and information, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it seems your type of tautologous speculation can never get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anywhere.
</em><br>
<p>No, it won't.  In fact, I think something quite radical about
<br>
consciousness, that gets us quite far indeed, but we're talking about
<br>
something else at the moment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Best to ASSUME we have free will, even if cannot ultimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know it to be so ... if we assume fatalism and determinism then no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point ever doing anything? (Fatalism and determinism just as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceptual make-believe as free will incidentally).
</em><br>
<p>Determinism does not imply fatalism.  I still need to get up in the
<br>
morning, or else I won't be happy.  And I want to be happy.  (Though I
<br>
don't choose to want to be happy.)
<br>
<p>Yes, determinism vs. free will is a pointless debate.  Except for when
<br>
people start saying that computers can't be like us because one of us
<br>
is determined and the other is not.  That's when we have to have the
<br>
argument.
