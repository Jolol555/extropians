<em>&gt; &gt; This is an amusing joke, but not an accurate definition.  If you look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; up philosophy in the dictionary, you will find that it is the inquiry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into the nature of things based on logical reasoning rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; empirical methods.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's that &quot;rather than&quot; which prompts me to label philosophy the art of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;asking the wrong questions. If a certain Greek philosopher had used an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;empirical method (counting his wife's teeth) instead of simply asserting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that women have a different number of teeth than men, I think he would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;done better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Which philosopher was this? And maybe he did, maybe his wife just had less 
<br>
teeth.
<br>
Anyway, yeah, a lot of philosophy asks the wrong questions. Consider this 
<br>
one:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thesius's ship should be preserved, since it is a peice of Greek 
<br>
history. They keep it docked, but it starts to decay. Every time a peice of 
<br>
wood decays even a bit, it is replaced with a freh board. Eventually, every 
<br>
board has been replaced. Is it still Thesius's ship? If no, at what point 
<br>
was it no longer that ship? When did it lose it's &quot;Thesius's ship&quot;-ness? 
<br>
Furthermore, a scrap dealer stumbles upon all the semi-rotting wood which 
<br>
has been removed from Thesius's ship. He takes it, and, since it's not 
<br>
completely rotten, he actually assembles a ship from it, he has re-assmbled 
<br>
Thesius's original ship. He docks it next to the first ship. Which one is 
<br>
really Thesius's ship?
<br>
Someone came to give a philosophy talk at the college I went to and argued 
<br>
that they both are, and that this teaches us something about objects and 
<br>
space. His hypothesis was that this proves that an object can be in two 
<br>
places at the same time. Amazing! Thesius's ship was in two places at the 
<br>
same time, docked right next to eachother.
<br>
The reason this peice of philosophy is valuable is because it takes &quot;common 
<br>
sense&quot; hidden assumptions about the nature of objects and applies it to a 
<br>
problem, which leads to a nonsensical result and shows that the common sense 
<br>
assumptions about objects, the premises by which most people think about 
<br>
objects, are false. If you're a good philosopher, you're going to figure out 
<br>
why these wrong questions are the wrong questions.
