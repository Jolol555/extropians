<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, but it would not be necessary that we would have found ourselves

<em>&gt; &gt; originating from a solar system where two civilizations had evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; independently. That is the extra finding that would make all the

<em>&gt;it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would have been extremely unlikely that it would have happened on another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; planet in our own solar system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, you see, you're stuck measuring things on a plantary scale.  Couldn't we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instead surmise that our -solar system- was particularly good at creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life-bearing conditions?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, if you thought that the improbability lay in the task of getting a 
<br>
suitable solar system together and that once you had the right 
<br>
constellation of planets etc then it would be easy for organic matter to 
<br>
emerge and evolve into intelligent creatures. However, empirically that 
<br>
looks highly implausible. We have already discovered over fifty extra-solar 
<br>
planets and have every reason to believe that the universe abounds with 
<br>
them. Stars that are similar to our sun are also very common. By contrast, 
<br>
there are many excellent candidates for the great filter between &quot;there 
<br>
being a suitable solar system&quot; and &quot;intelligent life has evolved&quot;.
<br>
<p>The one possible qualification to this is if you think life might have 
<br>
jumped from one planet to another as a result of a meteor or asteroid 
<br>
blast. But if we're talking about discovering life that's evolved 
<br>
independently on another planet in our vicinity, then that's very strong 
<br>
evidence that life is quite common in the universe.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Let us take a step back.  Let's pretend that planets don't develop life:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;realities develop life.  (Or rather, realities develop universes, universes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;develop planets and planets develop life.)  Let's further pretend that &quot;we&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't equal humanity, but rather &quot;we&quot; equals &quot;all observers.&quot;  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what the AP really says after all, doesn't it:  i.e.: Observers should not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be surprised to be observing a reality that begets observers.  Right?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not keen on entering a debate about what &quot;the anthropic principle&quot; 
<br>
says. I've counted over 20 different and incompatible definitions in the 
<br>
literature - it's simply a big mess! But the interesting idea, the one that 
<br>
motivated Brandon Carter who invented the term &quot;anthropic principle&quot;, is 
<br>
that of observational selection effects. A first approximation of this is 
<br>
given by the Self-Sampling Assumption, which says that: &quot;Each observer 
<br>
should reason as if they were a random sample from the class of all 
<br>
observers in their reference class.&quot; (Please see my writings for how this 
<br>
is to be interpreted.) I see this an a deep (and non-trivial) 
<br>
methodological principle, for which compelling arguments can be given. It 
<br>
has lots of interesting consequences. This is an exciting new area, where 
<br>
philosophers and physicists are cooperating in fruitful ways. When thinking 
<br>
about the large-scale structure of the world and the place of observers 
<br>
within it, observational selection effects must be taken into account. It 
<br>
also has applications in down-to-earth fields, like traffic analysis.
<br>
<p>That reality begets observers might well be surprising. It depends on what 
<br>
reality is like. If things were set up in such a way that it would have 
<br>
been extremely improbable that any observers should have come to exist 
<br>
(imagine e.g. some cosmic fortune wheel that had to stop in a very unlikely 
<br>
spot for life to emerge) then our existence would indeed be surprising. It 
<br>
is partly in order to avoid stipulating such a surprising contingency that 
<br>
people are leaning towards theories (such as multiverse theories) according 
<br>
to which it would be much more probable that observers should exist.
