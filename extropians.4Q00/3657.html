<p><p><em>&gt; If you're on the Extropian list I assume you believe that mind is what the
</em><br>
brain
<br>
<em>&gt; does, if the brains are identical then what they're doing is identical and
</em><br>
so  the mind
<br>
<em>&gt; is identical and the feeling of self is identical. That doesn't seem very
</em><br>
mystical to me.
<br>
<p>It looks like this is not a safe assumption to make [regarding the make-up
<br>
of the Extropian list]
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Ok, before the switch one hydrogen atom is bound to oxygen and one is not,

<em>&gt; after the switch one hydrogen atom is bound to oxygen and one is not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No detectable change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But wait, now a new hydrogen atom is bound to oxygen and a new one is not!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can you tell?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can't.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but if those hydrogen atoms have the ability to experience reality,
<br>
then *they* can tell, and that's the whole point.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;     &gt;You still aren't explaining why you think that just putting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; them in the same environment mystically links them so that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; become &quot;one&quot; with each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe I have explained that, identical things do identical things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nothing very mystical about that either.
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't matter if they do identical things, they are still separate.
<br>
Your insistence on treating separate instances as the same thing seems
<br>
unnecessarily imprecise.  You'll admit, I hope that there is a -difference-
<br>
between having one Jason and having two Jasons...?  There's discretionary
<br>
value in recognizing the existence of two instances-- why ignore this
<br>
information?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;     &gt; What transfers the consciousness between one to the other?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've answered this several times also, Information. If you don't like my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer then criticize it, but don't keep asking the same question.
</em><br>
<p>We don't like your answer.
<br>
<p>Information is simply data.  You have the data by which to re-create a
<br>
separate, very precise copy.  You could build a thousand of those copies, or
<br>
just one, and each instance would be discrete from the original.  The
<br>
experience of the original would be unchanged.  Again, you aren't proposing
<br>
a means by which we *transfer* (MOVE!) or even change the original
<br>
consciousness, but rather a means by which we *copy* it.  I don't understand
<br>
how you can hold the belief that there is an actual transference of
<br>
consciousness happening here without some sort of appeal to mystical forces.
<br>
If you secretly make a copy of me and activate it in Paris, how does that
<br>
change my subjective experience?  Please describe in detail how information
<br>
transfers the consciousness from Me 1, to Me-In-Paris.
<br>
<p>Of course, we're probably going to just keep going around and around like
<br>
this...
