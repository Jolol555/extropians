Hello from the last hours of the twentieth century In Alaska,

Interesting.  So, we could see a situation where the programmers start buying business suits again, because the suits are the only wearable items expensive enough - and voluminous enough - to contain decent-sized computers.  Male geeks wearing suits, female geeks wearing three layers of gowns... computer modeling of what people look like under their clothes... 900Mhz encrypted flirting... wearable computing could have an interesting effect on sexual morality.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>So we will have a return to at least *outward* moral conservatism when it comes to dress!!  Women will be asking, &quot;what do you have inside your coat? lol  
<br>
<p>How about the fully dressed but very sexy look of big leather coats which we saw in Matrix?  But leather  can get hot I hear.  I should ask the biker guy who owns the video store in my neighborhood.  God help you if the videos are not rewound...    
<br>
<p>Sadly, with the onslaught of technological development we will have very compact yet powerful portable  computing.  You know what that will do... push the hemlines up and cause people to show off their bodies!!  The day when a woman can wear only a string bikini but have on her the power of a present-day supercomputer will make us all so happy! lol

Using GPS, tell me where I am and how to get wherever I want to go using GPS, tell me where my child is (or wife or consenting members of a

<br>
<p>Gee, thanks Terry!  My girlfriend would just love to go out and &quot;brand&quot; me with one of these devices.  I would get calls like, &quot;are you still at the damn library?&quot;
<br>
<p>best wishes,
