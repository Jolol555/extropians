<em>&gt;Two of my heroes are Larry Flynt and Dr. Kevorkian. Both of them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;treat absurd laws (against obscenity, and against ownership of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own life) with open defiance.
</em><br>
<p>As much as I agree that the laws those guys have fought against are 
<br>
absurd:  Is the best solution to just ignore them?
<br>
<p>Everyone thinks some law or other is absurd, is the general solution 
<br>
for everyone to just ignore the ones they don't like?
<br>
<p>Does the existence of factions ignoring sets of laws really reduce 
<br>
the size and power of government, or just its effectiveness?  Look at 
<br>
the War on Drugs - many politicians think that in order to solve 
<br>
defiance of drug laws, they need to spend more money on enforcement, 
<br>
which requires more taxpayer dollars, which increases the size of 
<br>
government, which increases the power of government, which gives some 
<br>
other government pinhead the power to attack some other group 
<br>
ignoring laws, and so on, and so on.
<br>
<p>If anything, I think that we need to be zealots about both enforcing 
<br>
the laws that we have and *drastically* reducing the number of laws 
<br>
that needlessly affect our lives.
<br>
<p>Just a thought,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
