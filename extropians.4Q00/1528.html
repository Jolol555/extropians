<p>On this note, I'd like to offer my help in getting Extropy Online magazine back
<br>
on track, since publishing is my main occupation these days, I have the tools
<br>
and skills to do so efficiently, both in HTML and PDF formats. Another thing I'd
<br>
like to do is work on the list archives, getting them updated and fixed up, if
<br>
someone else is not already working on it. Whoever is in charge of those areas
<br>
these days please let me know if my help is needed...
