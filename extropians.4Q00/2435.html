<br>
<p>The future of science and technology are not mystical, not magick, not
<br>
mysterious.
<br>
<p>(Then what is it?)
<br>
<p>A transhuman is not supernatural.
<br>
<p>(Maybe &quot;supernatural&quot;, or replace trans with post?)
<br>
<p>Capital 'P' Powers are not amazing or incredible, they are merely currently
<br>
inscrutable.
<br>
<p>(semantics)
<br>
<p>Mystics read fantasy, extropians read science fiction.
<br>
Get it?
<br>
<p>(Fantasy is what scientists don't have the imagination to believe.
<br>
Fantasy is a reality on the other side of the universe.
<br>
Science fiction is engineers' porn.
<br>
I prefer medical literature or interdisciplinary works by authors with lots 
<br>
of letters around their names.
<br>
Have you read Eat Right 4 Your Type?
<br>
It's mainly nutrition and anthropology.
<br>
I learned more from it than I read.)
<br>
<p>Did I piss you off a few years ago or something?
