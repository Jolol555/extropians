</em><br>
<p>I could do some research, but off the top of my head there was a case
<br>
across the river in White River Junction, VT just a couple months ago
<br>
where a black police officer was called n_____ by a drunk woman he
<br>
arrested for D&amp;D. At the station he also pressed charges for a hate
<br>
crime, and won in court over her innocent plea. The woman insisted she
<br>
never used such language when sober and did not conciously intend to use
<br>
that epithet. Given that drugs like alcohol act to suppress the ego and
<br>
allow the id more liberties (i.e. reduces inhibitions) this is as close
<br>
to a thought crime as I think it is possible to go. Its tantamount to
<br>
putting a right wing republican under the influence of sodium pentathol
<br>
and asking them if they'd like to off Pres. Clinton if given the
<br>
opportunity, then charging them with violation of federal law.
