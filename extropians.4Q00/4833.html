<br>
<p><p>Ed Klobucher doesn't use a crystal ball. There are no
<br>
tarot cards spread on his coffee table, no Ouija board
<br>
stashed in his Hazel Park hall closet.
<br>
<p>Still, Klobucher can say with confidence that in 2001,
<br>
more Arab Americans will be elected to local
<br>
government; in 15 years, Michigan will have a mass
<br>
transit system, and 20 years down the road, human body
<br>
parts will be cloned to save lives.
<br>
<p>But he cannot pick the next winning lotto numbers or
<br>
say whether your boyfriend will pop the question.
<br>
<p>Klobucher, 37, predicts the future. But rather than
<br>
rely on tea leaves and palm lines, he and 30,000 other
<br>
members of the World Future Society identify trends,
<br>
create possible scenarios and consult experts in
<br>
various fields to predict what will happen in 2001, as
<br>
well as 100 years down the road.
<br>
<p>&quot;There are two purposes for futuristic studies: making
<br>
forecasts for what might happen and identifying a
<br>
preferred future,&quot; Klobucher said.
<br>
<p>For instance, by tracking urban sprawl and the growing
<br>
road congestion in northern Oakland County, Klobucher
<br>
predicted a mass transit system will be built. With an
<br>
eye on scientific progress, Klobucher says that far in
<br>
the future there will be a way to halt human aging.
<br>
<p>And, without Y2K hype and the looming fear that the
<br>
world may end, Klobucher predicts that New Year's Eve
<br>
partyers will have more fun Sunday night.
<br>
<p>In southeast Michigan, the World Future Society is
<br>
gaining ground. The society, founded in 1966, is a
<br>
nonprofit, nonpartisan clearinghouse for predictions in
<br>
Bethesda, Md. Last year, Klobucher opened the state's
<br>
first chapter, and it has attracted 15 people who meet
<br>
about three times a year to ruminate on the what-ifs.
<br>
Even far-out ones.
<br>
<p>For instance, what if India and Pakistan launch a
<br>
nuclear war? Or if nanotechnology becomes so advanced
<br>
that scientists can rearrange the molecules of charcoal
<br>
dust into diamonds?
<br>
<p>&quot;Even though a prediction isn't accurate it doesn't
<br>
mean that it doesn't have any value,&quot; Klobucher said.
<br>
&quot;Sometimes a prediction itself can change the outcome.&quot;
<br>
<p>And sometimes, just the act of learning to predict is
<br>
useful. Klobucher uses his forecasting skills to
<br>
pinpoint trends in Hazel Park, where he is assistant
<br>
city manager. He also teaches Introduction to Future
<br>
Studies, a political science and sociology class at
<br>
Madonna University in Livonia.
<br>
<p>Futurists hail from all fields and approach predictions
<br>
with a range of biases -- they can be optimists or
<br>
pessimists, Republicans or Democrats.
<br>
<p>&quot;If you ask two different futurists you'll get two
<br>
different answers,&quot; Klobucher said. For the record,
<br>
Klobucher labels himself a Republican optimist.
<br>
<p>Ray Kurzweil is one of today's more prominent futurists
<br>
and has earned a reputation for on-the-mark
<br>
predictions, Klobucher said. In Kurzweil's 1999 book,
<br>
&quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines,&quot; he predicts that 20
<br>
years from now, $1,000 computers will match the
<br>
brainpower of humans.
<br>
<p>And, just as there are accurate futurists, others get
<br>
it wrong.
<br>
<p>Take Alex Lewyt, president of Lewyt Vacuum Cleaner Co.,
<br>
who predicted nuclear-powered vacuum cleaners would be
<br>
a reality in the next 10 years. That was in 1955.
<br>
<p>Similarly, more pressing predictions may remain out of
<br>
reach. Is the country's slowing economy headed for a
<br>
full-blown recession?
<br>
<p>&quot;If I could tell that, I probably would be working
<br>
someplace else right now,&quot; Klobucher said, laughing.
