<em>&gt; Now imagine that you could break causality and give $1 to yourself ten years
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; today, for this privilege?  If you would be willing to pay $2.60 today, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferences are time-consistent. If you would be willing to pay less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $2.60, you fit the assumption made by Caplin &amp; Leahy.  If you would be willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pay more than $2.60, your preferences are time-inconsistent in the opposite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction.
</em><br>
<p>If you would not pay $2.60 to give your ten year ago self $1, isn't this
<br>
equivalent to saying that you regret that you didn't save $1 ten years
<br>
ago so that you could have $2.60 today?
<br>
<p>And if this is the case for most people, doesn't it imply in effect that
<br>
most of us regret most of the consumption we have done in the past?
<br>
<p>I don't think we do.  Hence I think that people's reluctance to &quot;give
<br>
themselves $1 in the past&quot; is more due to the difficulty of analyzing
<br>
such an impossibly hypothetical scenario.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is fundamentally not an issue of learning.  It is a conflict of preferences.
</em><br>
<p>I think that constantly regretting most past actions, without changing
<br>
our current behavior, can fairly be called a failure of learning.
