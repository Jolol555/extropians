<p><em>    &gt; A thermostat is set to switch on or off at a given (preset)
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; temperature. It cannot decide to override this setting, so
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; does not make this &quot;decision&quot; internally.
</em><br>
<p>A thermostats makes its decision based on its internal state and
<br>
the external state of the environment, people do the same thing, both
<br>
&quot; readjust their logic in response to the environment&quot; as you say.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;If a thermostat can alter its own  settings, then it is infinite-state by definition.
</em><br>
<p>What a silly thing to say, it's infinite-state by definition if it has infinite states.
<br>
If a finite state Turing machine can't alter its own settings then you should be able
<br>
to predict what it will do, so I'll run one programmed to look at the even numbers greater
<br>
than 4 and stop when it finds the first on that is that is not the sum of two primes
<br>
(except 1 and 2). It's a simple program needing just a few lines of code, but will it ever stop?
<br>
Nobody knows, and it's entirely possible nobody will ever know because its unknowable
<br>
even in theory.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Turing machines are neither conscious,
</em><br>
<p>How do you know?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Digital computers tends to be finite-state, whereas analog(ous
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; to infinite-state) evolvable hardware is more like our brains.
</em><br>
<p>Welcome to the exciting world of analog computing. Thanks to the
<br>
new Heath Kit Home Study Course, you can build your very own
<br>
analog computer in the  privacy of your own home. Make big bucks!
<br>
Amaze your friends! Be a hit at  parties! This is a true analog computer,
<br>
no wimpy pseudo analog stuff here, this baby can handle infinity.
<br>
<p>Before we begin construction there are a few helpful hints I'd
<br>
like to pass along. Always keep your workplace neat and clean.
<br>
Make sure your computer is cold, as it will not operate at any
<br>
finite temperature above absolute zero. Use only analog
<br>
substances and processes, never use digital things like matter,
<br>
spin, or electrical charge when you build your analog computer.
<br>
<p>Now that we got those minor points out of the way we can start to
<br>
manufacture your analog computer.
<br>
<p>Step One: Repeal the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
<br>
Step Two: Use any infinitely accurate measuring stick you have handy and [...]
<br>
[...]
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Turing machines are hard-wired and cannot evince PHASIC
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;TRANSIENT behaviour  ... correct me if I am wrong?
</em><br>
<p>Ok, you are wrong. A Turing machine is not hard wired, its program
<br>
can put it into any internal configuration, and the only behavior
<br>
a Turing machine can't produce is pure randomness, that is, produce
<br>
an effect without a cause.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Sense-data (experience) and the conscious sensor/ self
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;seem to be different types
</em><br>
<p>How so?
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;MVT explains the virtual sensor(gan), the phantom median  eye
</em><br>
<p>Seems to me all you've done is conjure up a black box, call it the
<br>
phantom median eye and say consciousness comes from there.
<br>
Not very helpful.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;I don't want to get bogged down in individual cases because of the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;problem  of solipsism.
</em><br>
<p>You're going to have to get bogged down in it because if you have a complete
<br>
theory of consciousness you should be able to prove that solipsism is untrue
<br>
but you can't and I don't believe such a theory is even possible. Please
<br>
understand, I'm not a solipsist but when somebody claims to have solved the
<br>
most profound problem in philosophy it's my duty to pretend that I am and see
<br>
if they can prove me wrong.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Do you accept that dreams happen?
</em><br>
<p>I accept that my dreams happen, I don't know about you.
