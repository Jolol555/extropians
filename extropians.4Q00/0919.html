<p><em>&gt;Yes.  But killing the killer will not bring that person back.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will only result in another individual irretrievably lost.
</em><br>
<p>True, but it will effectively punish the murderer for the crime
<br>
committed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A sentient, caring person can come to appreciate the enormity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the wrongness of the act if properly reformed and never perform
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such an act again.  Many acts short of murder but also quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heinous cannot be undone.  At best one can make what poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;atonement one can and resolve never to perform in such a way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;again.  Or do you believe all wrong-doers should be executed given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your logic?
</em><br>
<p>As I have stated, the death penalty is only for the crime of
<br>
murder.
<br>
<p>What about a murderer who is not a caring sentient person, but a
<br>
monster, annoyed with being incarcerated for what he see's as
<br>
something the victim deserved for rejecting him, and never showing
<br>
the slightest remorse. (yes, this is from personnal experience)
<br>
<p>You fail to address the issue of proper punishment.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;How can a sentient, caring person condemn another human being to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;irreversible and irretrievable death?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
When that human being has committed an irreversible crime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This could also lead to a dilemma: What if someone decided to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; kill someone knowing the worst that could happen is that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;bad part&quot; would be purged. They would still accomplish their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  task.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;It is not that simple by far.  There is no &quot;bad part&quot;.  This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strawman.  Their task was a misaligned way of acheiving some goal. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cure the misalignment if you can.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
You are addressing a rhetorical question, yes it is a strawman.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Most likely many such murders would be avoided by better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychological and sociological practices before the fact.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I agree that this is where we should apply our efforts, but we must
<br>
still deal with failures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Axiology: The branch of philosophy dealing with values, as those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of ethics, aesthetics, or religion.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Cute, but hopefully incorrect as we very much require ethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;especially as we become more powerful.
</em><br>
<p>I was not trying to be cute, merely providing a definition as part
<br>
of the discussion, but I agree with your point.
