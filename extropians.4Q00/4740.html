<em>&gt; For the record, the impression I got from GATTACA was that genetic

</em><br>
<em>&gt; genemod human would be in, say, the top 1% relative to today's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distribution of physiques, but that intelligence engineering would be only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the top 10% if it worked at all.  Thus a not-very-exceptional exceptional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human could easily outcompete an average genemod for brains, but it would
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Right, I think the key to understanding the movie is that the &quot;valids&quot;
<br>
are not actually intellectually superior.  It is purely a social
<br>
prejudice which allows them to be treated as such, and as with other
<br>
forms of prejudice it tends to be self-perpetuating.  The invalids have
<br>
worse schooling, fewer opportunities, they tend to be poor and working
<br>
in unpleasant jobs, which makes them look less intellectual.
<br>
<p>Vincent is like a fair-skinned black man who passes for white, as some
<br>
minorities did during the time of open prejudice.  Such individuals could
<br>
excel, free from the judgements that would be applied against the group
<br>
that they were part of, but they lived constantly in fear that their
<br>
true identity would be exposed.
