<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;...What had been an unfolding financial dislocation took a dramatic turn for

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have only this to say:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although I am by no means a financial or economic expert, and I have no solid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason to believe or doubt that a economic crisis is [imminent], I've noticed that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have over the past 6 months focused *exclusively* on this premise. You have chosen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only to post those predictions that support a 'crisis' thesis, while neglecting all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other articles to the contrary (and there are plenty -I've looked). 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we are all quite aware of the upbeat side. It was the 'religion' up 
<br>
until this year. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Forrest?  Why the bias?  And why in a negative direction to boot?
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;direction&quot; is neutral. It is one component of a &quot;most probable&quot; 
<br>
resultant. And yes, I am something of a &quot;financial and economic&quot; 
<br>
student, and a student of history- the history of money in particular.
<br>
&nbsp;The current running experiment has been run many times before- the 
<br>
financial crisis of Uruk in 1788 BCE (the city was then abandoned 
<br>
forever), the Athens real estate bubble of 333 BCE (it required 1000 
<br>
years for prices to recover the peak), the South Seas Bubble (Isaac 
<br>
Newton lost most of his fortune, commented to the effect he could 
<br>
understand physics but not human nature), The Mississippi Scheme, the 
<br>
canal, railroads, land rushes, 1929, 1989 (Japan), 1997 (Asia), etc.
<br>
<p>Take for example the proposition &quot;all paper will burn&quot;. This is a 
<br>
prediction based on centuries of experimental observations, probably 
<br>
dating to the invention of paper itself. 
<br>
The invention and use of paper money, or &quot;bills of credit&quot;, has a
<br>
shorter
<br>
and well-documented history. This experiment has been run hundreds of 
<br>
times over the past 1000 years or so, and *always* returns the same 
<br>
result:
<br>
&quot;Paper money returns to its intrinsic value- zero&quot;--Voltaire
<br>
<p>What is unique about the present situation is the unprecedented scale, 
<br>
exceeding 1929 by every measure, for example. The incresing frequency 
<br>
and amplitude of currency/economic collapses over the past 16 years or
<br>
so,
<br>
and the increasing frequency and amplitude of global stock, currency and 
<br>
bond market moves- particularly the past few weeks, are indicative of a
<br>
global financial &quot;crisis&quot; or &quot;collapse&quot; in the near term. I posted
<br>
several 
<br>
months ago that I did not think &quot;they&quot; would be able to keep &quot;it&quot;
<br>
together 
<br>
until the elections (Nov 7th), I still don't think so, though it is 
<br>
foolish to time the market. The driver is as always a loss of investor 
<br>
confidence, which now appears to be occuring.
<br>
(Xerox, btw is rumored to be bankrupt.)
<br>
<p>======
<br>
<p>Meditate on this:
<br>
&quot;...There is a huge difference between controlling an &quot;ongoing price
<br>
inflation&quot;
<br>
and battling an ongoing timeline failure of your currency. The first is
<br>
controlled through printing restraint, while the second is managed to a
<br>
bitter
<br>
end. Some would sarcastically say &quot;[its] manipulated for [its] longest
<br>
lasting
<br>
effects&quot;....&quot;
<br>
<p>[He is referring to the US dollar.]
<br>
<p>and this:
<br>
&quot;Stocks became the primary tool of
<br>
&nbsp;economic policy in the G-22 many months ago, first and foremost in the
<br>
&nbsp;U.S..  Whatever is harmful to stocks, the vehicle by which the greatest
<br>
&nbsp;government confiscation of wealth ever is being effected, will be
<br>
targeted
<br>
&nbsp;for neutralization…&quot;
<br>
<p>Mania dynamics are different from ordinary bull/bear markets, they 
<br>
generally result in the destruction of the market itself. 
<br>
Greenspan knows this.
<br>
<p>======
<br>
<p>It is not possible to understand history without understanding economics 
<br>
and money. Unfortunatly, these subjects are no longer taught in the USA,
<br>
so one has to teach oneself.
<br>
It is not possible to be a reliable futurist without a grounding in 
<br>
these matters. More on that later.
<br>
<p>It used to amaze me (as it did Newton) that a group-insanity (mania)
<br>
can be so pervasive, it does not amaze me anymore. This is a subject I 
<br>
may return to a bit later.

or online: <a href="http://www.realityzone.com/freedom.html">http://www.realityzone.com/freedom.html</a>
<br>
<p>is an excellent place to begin your re-education. It should be a 
<br>
required course in grade school. Lots of historical information and 
<br>
a quick primer on how the Federal Reserve operates (and most central 
<br>
banks). Unfortunatly, due to length, the author does not go into how
<br>
WWII was arranged and financed. It is interesting how much American 
<br>
gold showed up in Europe after being confiscated in 1933, isn't it?
