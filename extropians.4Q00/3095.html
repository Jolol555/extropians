always relatively conserving of the status quo forces arrayed against

relatively expansionist forces of change.  Indeed there is some need
<br>
that it be that way.  Why does it dismay you?

</em><br>
<p>Competition is one of many memes.  One that is not the cure for all
<br>
evils now and forever necessarily.  In the Open Source world I see
<br>
another word being floated, &quot;coopetition&quot;.  Cooperate where cooperation
<br>
is the best choice or where there are common interest served and compete
<br>
in other areas.  Defeatist stuff has been part of human cultures from
<br>
the beginning.

<p>Well, they in part got screwed by having much of their plumbing and the
<br>
drinking untensils of the rich be lined with lead.  Lead poisoning
<br>
psychosis is not a pretty thing.
<br>
<p>As the pace of change accelerates more and more people will feel serious
<br>
strain.  Many of them will attempt to stand aside from the changes or to
<br>
demand they slow down or go away.  Many will choose between old
<br>
religious values they once learned and having to cope with the
<br>
increasingly complex real world.  If you want to reach them perhaps you
<br>
need to show them that this changing world is actually massively in
<br>
their interest and that of their children.
<br>
<p>That article was not completely off.  From a point of view of attempting
<br>
to learn wisdom in the face of adversity (which many have learned to
<br>
prize throughout human history) it seems quite perverse to simply
<br>
eliminate huge swaths of the adversity thus making the wisdom of
<br>
accepting it foolish.  It is not difficult to understand how some people
<br>
would feel this way.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 3. Humans have an inherent tendency toward self-defeatism and hatred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of success. Except us mutants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No.  Not except us mutants.  We are all too human.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 4. Some religionists went underground and resurfaced as &quot;modern&quot; luddites.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Religionists have not uniformly been in a luddite or anti-progress
<br>
camp.  You can fine perfectly healthy religious fervor in many
<br>
extropians.  Except that many of us think we see how a true New Heaven
<br>
and New Earth (if you will) can come to be. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Whatever the case, there's too many of them to enlighten. We'll soon be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overrun. The only remaining course of action is clear... let's re-read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Atlas Shrugged and start packing our bags.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Do you then assume people cannot be reached and cannot change?  Where
<br>
exactly will you pack your bags off too?  You might want to develop an
<br>
impervious force field before claiming a sufficiently large hunk of
<br>
earth real estate for all of us.
