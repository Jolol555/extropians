<p><em>&gt; Ha!  Handforged each one and zero, did you?  We only we had ones.  And we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't handforge them, because we had to make our own iron atoms from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hydrogen.  Some days we didn't even have hydrogen and we had to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primordial ylem.  We sent packets by carrier pigeon until all the pigeons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; died of the plague, and then we had to invent fire before we could use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smoke signals.  And a Babbage Machine, oh, we never even dreamed of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Babbage Machine.  We had to use slide rules chipped out of flint and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Granpa died before his was finished booting up.  Our whole village only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had one bit of RAM.  It weighed thirty pounds and we had to share it with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the neighbors.
</em><br>
<p>Back in my day, we didn't even have the full set of Peano's axioms. We
<br>
didn't have 'zero', so we had to do without natural numbers and
<br>
addition. We had to make do with scraps from empty sets. 
<br>
<p>If you tell that to the youth today they just don't believe you.
