<em>&gt; &gt; Youch! Have you been following me around the net?
</em><br>

<em>&gt; I know everything about you.  I know your true name... Anton.  I know that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're an only child.  I know where you live in Sioux Falls, South
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dakota.  I know about the time you stole a book from your grade school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; library.  I know that your mother secretly wanted a girl and that she felt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guilty about it, which is why she always bought you those macho toys for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christmas presents, and I also know that she did love you and that she had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no cause to feel guilty.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;shivers&gt;
<br>
<p>My middle name is Anton.  Four years ago, I wrote some articles for a few
<br>
minor zines under the name N. Anton MacDonald.
<br>
<p>I am from Sioux Falls.  Where in the hell did you pull that out of?
<br>
<p>However, you didn't get the whole story.  My mother may have wanted a girl-
<br>
my parents were either going to name me Nicholas or Nicolette- but I'm not
<br>
an only child, and I never stole a book from my grade school library.  Well,
<br>
I kept a few of them longer than I was supposed to... especially the ones
<br>
with completed BASIC scripts in them, and the one on creating terrariums...
<br>
but that's it! ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You read all that Aleister Crowley, and then look for simple little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical explanations when something marvelous comes along.  Unweave a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rainbow...
</em><br>
<p>Well, considering the quote that I frequently use as a sig, that one is
<br>
obvious enough.  Trying to be a skeptic and an occultist at the same time is
<br>
a real challenge- especially for a borderline manic depressive who takes
<br>
everything he sees as
<br>
<p>By the way, thanks a lot for that link to Nikolai Kingsley's website- his
<br>
writing reminds me of the stories I cook up when I'm in a good mood... he
<br>
thinks like I do, in many ways.  If only I didn't take myself so damn
<br>
seriously...
<br>
<p>-Nicq (or should I say Anton) MacDonald
