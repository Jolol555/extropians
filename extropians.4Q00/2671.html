<em>&gt; anyway, there was this SciAm article by a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few years ago that provoked me into looking for any info on this weird 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conjecture. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The article dealt with a mythological court case in which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one physicist's recipe for Hungarian goulash was cruelly, tossed into a black 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hole. The judge in the case eventually ruled that the recipe was not lost 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eternally, but could be theoretically recovered by extraordinary, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;normal&quot; means.
</em><br>
<p>As I understand the Schwartzchild geometry, a little while after an object
<br>
has been tossed into a black hole, it is unrecoverable.  Attempts to swoop
<br>
down and retrieve it, or even to shine a light beam onto it, won't work.
<br>
The object will hit the singularity before even a light beam can reach it.
<br>
<p>I know some people have postulated that the Hawking radiation which
<br>
will be eventually emitted when the black hole evaporates is not random.
<br>
It will somehow be subtly influenced by the contents of the black hole,
<br>
so that the information in the recipe will still be represented in the
<br>
details of the radiation that is emitted.  However this view is not very
<br>
widely accepted, as far as I know.
