Yikes.  First you don't want this topic discussed by the list, next 
<br>
you go on a rant that seems to demand a response.  What's it to be?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Of course, the really irritating thing that brought this on is the way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people CONTINUE to pillory Gore for things that he never actually said.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never said that he invented the internet
</em><br>
<p>Apologists for Gore always use the line, &quot;He didn't actually say that 
<br>
he invented the Internet!&quot;  They assume that such protestations will 
<br>
be the end of the discussion.  If I were trying to defend someone 
<br>
whom I thought had been misquoted, I would show the actual quote to 
<br>
show the fools the error of their ways.  In roughly a dozen such 
<br>
encounters on the Internet, I've yet to see them try the tactic.  The 
<br>
reason, I believe, is that the actual quote wouldn't help them at all.
<br>
<p>Here's the actual quote, with some context from his interview with 
<br>
Wolf Blitzer on March 9, 1999.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've traveled to every part of this country during the last six
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years. During my service in the United States Congress, I took the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important to our country's economic growth and environmental
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protection, improvements in our educational system.
<br>
<p>To many people, it seems that Al Gore was taking credit for the 
<br>
Internet.  It's certainly the way that I understood what he was 
<br>
saying when I saw the original interview.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This uproar over the speech is another
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thing in the same vein.  I would challenge you to say something, anything,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so long as it is coherent, that had not been said or written by someone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at some point in the history of language.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you in the sense that if this were an isolated incident, 
<br>
everyone is making too much of it.  However, you have to keep in mind 
<br>
that Al Gore has a reputation for embellishment and even outright 
<br>
lying.  It's hard to blame anyone but him for reinforcing that 
<br>
reputation.
<br>
<p>Ask Dan Quayle about being ridiculed for making small mistakes. 
<br>
Misspelling potato was such a minor thing.  I mean, the plural has an 
<br>
'e', and even the reporters in the room at the time had to look up 
<br>
the word to be sure of the mistake.  Misspelling a word on the spot 
<br>
like that is so unimportant, but it didn't stop the press and the 
<br>
entertainment industry from nailing Quayle to the wall over it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Though, unlike a certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;President-elect, Mr. Gore does write much of his own material, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it comes off
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as lucid if a bit staid.
</em><br>
<p>So, you're going to continue to take these little potshots at Bush, 
<br>
and then get upset when people snipe at Gore?  Can you say &quot;special 
<br>
pleading&quot;?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I forgot - Mr. Gore doesn't get any benefit of the doubt.  Mr. Bush has all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, man... too bad I can't play the violin.  Dan Rather was 
<br>
practically crying the other night after Gore's speech, and the other 
<br>
broadcast anchors were hardly any better at maintaining a modicum of 
<br>
objectivity.  Did you watch *any* late-night television during the 
<br>
past year?  Sure, they poked fun at Gore's lack of a personality, but 
<br>
they were utterly relentless at portraying Bush as a total idiot. 
<br>
Spare me the pity party for the benefit of the doubt that Gore never 
<br>
received.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   Why else would so many people who claim to be futurist oriented would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cast out the technocrat who has worked through much of his proven legislative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;career (unlike a certain limited-experience executive with little to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;public-record experience on anything)
</em><br>
<p>There ya go again, another pot shot.  I'd say that George Bush's 
<br>
experience in the business world is far more relevant to me than Al 
<br>
Gore's lifetime of never having a real job.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  supporting technological causes, in favor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of someone who would throw money raided from taxpayers (not my rhetoric, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the rhetoric I see here all the time about taxation of any kind) at faith-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;based (church) organizations with a deathist,
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  I've heard him talking about the benefits of relying on 
<br>
faith-based and other charitable organizations to fill some needs in 
<br>
our society, but you'll need to refer us to where he talked about 
<br>
sending taxpayer dollars that way.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;reactionary agenda that will,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probably sooner than later, come to a head against extropian values?
</em><br>
<p>On the one hand, we have Al Gore who would slow the R&amp;D of 
<br>
pharmaceutical companies and the medical industry to a crawl through 
<br>
the socialization of medicine, price fixing of drugs, typical Green 
<br>
Peace overreaction to GM food, and letting his buddies the trial 
<br>
lawyers continue to be the main recipients of every medical dollar 
<br>
spent.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, we have Bush who would be much less of an 
<br>
obstruction to the private research of biotechnologies, but may butt 
<br>
heads with us at some future date when we're ready to actually use 
<br>
these technologies.  Most likely, he won't even be in office then.
<br>
<p>Hmmmmmm.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does it have to do with being bought off by the bribe of a large tax-cut that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will not benefit many of the people here on this list?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;From www.georgebush.com:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His plan will promote economic growth and increase access to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the middle class by cutting high marginal rates.   It will also
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double the child credit, eliminate the death tax, reduce the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marriage penalty, and expand Education Savings Accounts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and charitable deductions.
<br>
<p>Sheesh, almost every part of that plan will benefit me, except for 
<br>
the death tax cut, and contrary to what Randy Smith said in this 
<br>
thread, some of it is for single people too.
<br>
<p>As far as being &quot;bought off&quot; goes, allowing people to keep more of 
<br>
the money that they and their family members earn is much less of a 
<br>
bribe than stealing money from the workers in our society (in the 
<br>
form of taxes) to buy the votes of those who are less 
<br>
industrious/capable/fortunate (in the form of entitlements).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I have serious doubts about Mr. Bush's committment to expanding possibilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of any kind, unless of course you happen to be wealthy, heterosexual, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religious.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;expanding possibilities&quot;?  If I wanted some government wonk to 
<br>
decide the future of my nation's technology direction, I'd move to 
<br>
France.  I want George Bush to get government off our f***ing backs 
<br>
and out of our wallets.  I want government out of our way so that we 
<br>
as entrepreneurs and consumers can expand the possibilities.  The 
<br>
first step is for someone in our government to admit that they're in 
<br>
our way.  George Bush has had the &quot;let the people decide what to do 
<br>
with their own money&quot; mantra in his arsenal from the beginning.  In 
<br>
contrast, Al Gore has a government solution to every problem 
<br>
imaginable.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;And worst of all, the real difference between the two comes down to a matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of degree.  If Al Gore is a socialist for defending Medicare, et al, why then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is Bush not pilloried for taking the same stands, simply with the numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;changed a bit, and often to a lesser degree?  This isn't the reductionist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rhetoric of the Gingrivh Revolution (tm), but the incremental coopting and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;triangulation&quot; pioneered by the right's favorite pol to hate, Bill Clinton.
</em><br>
<p>Time out while I agree with you.  In a way, I found this to be the 
<br>
most disappointing part of GWB's campaign - the capitulation to the 
<br>
prescription drug and medicare interests.  You're absolutely right 
<br>
that this was a classic Bill Clinton tactic, but like guerilla 
<br>
warfare, once it was introduced into the battlefield, it had to be 
<br>
met with similar tactics, or allowed to rule the day.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I will give Bush a chance to govern, and maybe he will prove me wrong.
</em><br>
<p>I'll give him a call on the big red phone and let him know it's okay 
<br>
to proceed.  I'm sure he'll be grateful for the opportunity. :)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;In the California senate race, there were two candidates facing off - Diane
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Feinstein, Democrat, and Tom Campbell, Republican.  They both had solid stands
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on issues, they articulated many of them, and both had records to choose from.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Most people will think I supported Feinstein.  Think again.  I felt the better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leader would have been Campbell, in part because of his stand on the War on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Some Drugs, and his support of personal freedom.  (Feinstein never met a gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control law she didn't like, or an expansion of police powers she didn't like,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;either).
</em><br>
<p>Well, good for you.  I support a lot of what the ACLU does, and 
<br>
always vote against overtly Fundy Christian Republicans when I have 
<br>
the chance (Gary Bauer &amp; Pat Robertson types).  Are we all 
<br>
sufficiently independent and objective now?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This is why partisanship is such a bad thing.  I guess I was disappointed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find this particular virulent strain of political fundamentalism amongst
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent people who have an avowed interest and investment in the future.
</em><br>
<p>With the implication being that you don't think that intelligent 
<br>
people could support George W. Bush... and you say that &quot;partisanship 
<br>
is such a bad thing.&quot;
<br>
<p>Pot... kettle...
