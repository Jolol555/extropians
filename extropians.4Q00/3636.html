<p>
To further expound on this copy-question, try this thought experiment 
<br>
resulting in six different copies.  I am not trying to prove a point 
<br>
here, and don't know what the &quot;right&quot; answer is.  I just want to see 
<br>
which copy people think is the best continuation of themselves.
<br>
<p>Your original, one-and-only body and brain are kidnapped by a mad 
<br>
scientist.  (Knowing this list, it's a possibility!)  The scientist 
<br>
makes an exact copy of your body.  The scientist then transfers your 
<br>
complete memory into the copy.  While doing this, your memories are 
<br>
completely erased in your original body.  The computer also keeps a 
<br>
buffered-memory copy of the operation and runs a comparison against 
<br>
it to verify that the copy is accurate.  After the mad scientist 
<br>
finishes, the brilliant idea occurs that he can make the copy better 
<br>
than the original.  A second duplicate is made, but this one is 
<br>
incredibly sexier, younger, smarter, and healthier than your original 
<br>
body, while it has the same memories and mannerisms.
<br>
<p>We now have these four entities:
<br>
<p>Number 1, dubbed &quot;the original&quot;, is a total amnesiac with no memory 
<br>
whatsoever, but fingerprints indicate it is you.
<br>
<p>Number 2, dubbed &quot;the copy&quot;, is apparently you, looks exactly like 
<br>
you, and has your exact memories and behavior mannerisms.
<br>
<p>Number 3, dubbed &quot;the youth&quot;, is physically better off than you were, 
<br>
but otherwise has your exact memories and behavior mannerisms.
<br>
<p>Number 4, dubbed &quot;the simulation&quot;, is a computer-generated simulation 
<br>
of you.  It is a projected picture on a computer screen that claims 
<br>
to be you, and seems to have all your exact memories and mannerisms.
<br>
<p>To carry this even further, imagine that the scientist loads your 
<br>
memories back into your meat brain, and then replaces each neuron of 
<br>
the original's brain with a machine neuron.  This is done one neuron 
<br>
at a time, and your brain keeps functioning while this is done. 
<br>
Eventually, the original brain is completely replaced with mechanical 
<br>
neurons.  Strangely, the mad scientist's assistant has reassembled 
<br>
the neurons into a completely functioning meat brain, and has 
<br>
transplanted it into a monkey.  We now have:
<br>
<p>Number 5, dubbed &quot;the android&quot;, with a completely mechanical brain, 
<br>
with all your exact memories and mannerisms.
<br>
<p>Number 6, dubbed &quot;the chimp&quot;, which looks like a chimp with a large 
<br>
brain pan, which seems to have all your exact memories and mannerisms.
<br>
<p>Which entity is &quot;you&quot;?  Any of them?  All of them?  Some of them?
<br>
<p>Note that I destroyed the original.  The amnesiac original is the 
<br>
most obvious choice for body continuation, but it had no memory or 
<br>
personality.  The chimp now contains the original meat brain with all 
<br>
its data, but the android alone maintained continuous functioning 
<br>
between the original meat-brain and a replacement.  The copy is the 
<br>
closest to what the original was like before, whereas the youth seems 
<br>
to be the best restoration of the original to good health.  The 
<br>
simulation exists in cyberspace and probably has the most 
<br>
possibilities of all the bodies.
<br>
<p>How would we rate these entities in probability of being &quot;you&quot;?
