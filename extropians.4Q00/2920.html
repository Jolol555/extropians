<p>Is Nanotechnology Dangerous?
<br>
<p>Robert F. Service
<br>
<p>The only realistic alternative I see is relinquishment: to limit
<br>
development of the technologies that are too dangerous, by limiting
<br>
our pursuit of certain kinds of knowledge.
<br>
<p>Bill Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, in the April issue of Wired.
<br>
<p>Bill Joy is nobody's Luddite. As co-founder and chief scientist of Sun
<br>
Microsystems in Palo Alto, California, he can match technophile
<br>
credentials with anybody on the planet. So when he argued that
<br>
research into nanotechnology and other fields should be stopped before
<br>
it wipes out humanity, humanity took notice.
<br>
<p>To the legion of chemists, physicists, and materials scientists who
<br>
spend their lives trying to understand and manipulate matter at the
<br>
nanoscale, Joy's warning--published in the April issue of Wired
<br>
magazine--felt like a bucket of ice water poured over their
<br>
heads. Others had raised similar concerns for decades. But Joy's
<br>
status among the digerati lent his allegations new heft. His fears of
<br>
nanotechnology, genetic engineering, and robotics research were
<br>
broadcast worldwide by news organizations including the Los Angeles
<br>
Times and CNN.
<br>
<p>Other voices joined the chorus of woe. In June, a group of
<br>
nanotechnology aficionados released what they called the Foresight
<br>
guidelines. Like Joy, they raised the specter of nanotechnology out of
<br>
control. But rather than simply calling for a halt to research, they
<br>
outlined measures they said would encourage governmental oversight of
<br>
nanotech's development. Such supervision, they argued, could help
<br>
prevent accidental catastrophe, much as the National Institutes of
<br>
Health's guidelines on recombinant DNA technology helped the emerging
<br>
biotech industry avoid accidental releases of genetically modified
<br>
organisms.
<br>
<p>At first, stunned nanoscience researchers quietly shrugged off the
<br>
concerns. But more recently, they've begun to fight back, arguing
<br>
vehemently at meetings that what Joy and others fear is at best
<br>
implausible and more likely plain wrong. &quot;The research community needs
<br>
to divorce itself from the lunatic fringe,&quot; says Steven Block, a
<br>
biophysicist at Stanford University in Palo Alto.
<br>
<p>These fears date back to the 1986 book Engines of Creation, by K. Eric
<br>
Drexler. In it, Drexler, a theoretician and chair of a nanotech think
<br>
tank called the Foresight Institute, paints a picture of utopia that
<br>
will result from the coming age of nanotechnology, a time when
<br>
miniature &quot;assemblers&quot; will run atomic-scale assembly lines,
<br>
fabricating virtually any imaginable product from the ground up, be it
<br>
a car, a carpet, or the steak for your grill. But Drexler also applies
<br>
his vivid imagination to nanotechnology's potential downside.  Of
<br>
particular concern is something he dubs the &quot;grey goo&quot; problem, in
<br>
which assemblers replicate themselves ad infinitum, consuming
<br>
everything in their path, including plants, pets, and people.
<br>
<p>In his Wired article, Joy admits that on the advice of scientist
<br>
friends, he initially dismissed Drexler's prophesies of nanoboom and
<br>
nanodoom. But last summer, he says, he learned that hypothetical
<br>
pieces of futuristic tiny machines were falling into place. One
<br>
component of such assemblers--molecule-sized electronic devices--was
<br>
&quot;now practical,&quot; Joy writes. Further-more, he learned that
<br>
self-replication--a feared component of nanomachines running amok--has
<br>
already gone beyond biological systems: Researchers had shown that
<br>
simple peptide molecules can catalyze their own reproduction. Although
<br>
perhaps not around the next bend, self-reproducing nanomachines were
<br>
becoming all too plausible, Joy concluded. And that spelled danger.
<br>
<p>But all it really spells, Block and others say, is a flawed
<br>
extrapolation of current capabilities into the future.  &quot;This has all
<br>
the depth of a parking lot puddle,&quot; says Block. It's simply incorrect
<br>
to make the logical leap that, just because simple molecules can
<br>
reproduce, scientists and engineers will be able to construct complex
<br>
nanomachines that do the same thing. &quot;Nobody has a clue how to build a
<br>
nanoassembler, much less get one to reproduce,&quot; Block says. Biological
<br>
systems, of course, reproduce. But they are both far larger than the
<br>
nanoscale and fantastically complex, with separate systems to store
<br>
and copy genetic information, produce energy, assemble proteins,
<br>
transport nutrients, and so on. Viruses, by contrast, are nanosized,
<br>
points out Viola Vogel, a nanoscientist at the University of
<br>
Washington, Seattle. But they can reproduce only by co-opting the
<br>
machinery of living cells. &quot;Even nature did not make a nanoscale
<br>
structure that can self-replicate,&quot; she says.
<br>
<p>Richard Smalley, a Nobel Prize-winning chemist at Rice University in
<br>
Houston, Texas, says that there are several good reasons to believe
<br>
that nanomachines of the sort imagined by Drexler and company can
<br>
never be made. &quot;To put it bluntly, I think it's impossible,&quot; Smalley
<br>
says. As he sees it, the idea of little machines that grab atoms and
<br>
assemble them into desired arrangements suffers from three
<br>
faults. First, he says, it's wrong to think you can just manipulate an
<br>
individual atom without handling the ones around it as well. &quot;The
<br>
essence of chemistry is missing here. Chemistry is not just sticking
<br>
one atom in one place and then going and grabbing another. Chemistry
<br>
is the concerted motion of at least 10 atoms.&quot; That means to move that
<br>
one atom where you want it, you'll need 10 nanosized appendages to
<br>
handle it along with all of its neighbors.
<br>
<p>Which raises the second problem--what Smalley calls the &quot;fat fingers&quot;
<br>
problem. A nanometer is just the width of eight oxygen atoms. So even
<br>
if you're trying to build something hundreds of nanometers in size,
<br>
&quot;there's just not enough room&quot; in that space to fit those 10 fingers
<br>
along with everything they are trying to manipulate. Finally, there's
<br>
the &quot;sticky fingers&quot; problem: Even if you could wedge all those little
<br>
claspers in there with their atomic cargo, you'd have to get them to
<br>
release those atoms on command. &quot;My advice is, don't worry about
<br>
self-replicating nanobots,&quot; says Smalley. &quot;It's not real now and will
<br>
never be in the future.&quot;
<br>
<p>In an e-mail exchange, Joy replies that he agrees that at the moment
<br>
the task of making nanobots seems implausible. &quot;No one denies it's
<br>
beyond the state of the art today, but many people see that this isn't
<br>
sufficient, in an era of such rapid progress, to allay our concerns.&quot;
<br>
Twenty or 30 years in the future, he argues, some combination of a
<br>
chemical self-assembly process and a bit of directed placement of
<br>
other atoms could create synthetic organisms that prey on cells just
<br>
as viruses do. And although researchers may raise objections to
<br>
specific schemes for making nanobots, &quot;where is the reasoned argument
<br>
that says this is impossible?&quot; Joy asks. &quot;Must we have a demonstration
<br>
of the danger--a grey goo accident--before we act?&quot;
<br>
<p>But this focus on what is possible is beside the point, says Irwin
<br>
Feller, who directs the Institute for Policy Research and Evaluation
<br>
at Pennsylvania State University, University Park. &quot;All things may be
<br>
possible,&quot; Feller says. &quot;But society will not place equal value on all
<br>
things.&quot; Or equal concern, for that matter, if the things are
<br>
considered wildly improbable.
<br>
<p>Which is not to say there are not reasons to be concerned about
<br>
nanotechnology. At a meeting sponsored by the National Science
<br>
Foundation in September, representatives from the research community,
<br>
think tanks, and government funding agencies huddled to discuss
<br>
emerging concerns for the field. Rather than nanobots, the greatest
<br>
issues were social: Is the educational system up to the task of
<br>
training enough nanotech workers?  Could nanoscience's progress in
<br>
areas such as electronics undermine traditional businesses on which
<br>
thousands of jobs depend? Could the decreasing cost of tools for doing
<br>
nanoscience and molecular biology make it easier for terrorists or
<br>
other small groups to engineer dangerous microbes? Such concerns, the
<br>
researchers concluded, are very real indeed.
<br>
<p>But that wasn't all. The biggest problem nanotechnology could face
<br>
down the road is public acceptance, said Richard Klausner, head of the
<br>
National Cancer Institute. Klausner wasn't worried about
<br>
nanobots. Rather, he argued that nanoscience is exploring numerous
<br>
revolutionary medical applications, such as creating implantable
<br>
sensors to watch for the signature molecules of cancer. But unless
<br>
patients are aware of the development of such tools beforehand, many
<br>
of them may balk at having their bodies invaded by technology.
<br>
<p>To better understand such concerns ahead of time, researchers need to
<br>
involve outsiders in the development process, much as AIDS activists
<br>
helped set priorities for research on AIDS drugs, says Klausner. &quot;I
<br>
think that didn't happen very effectively over the last 10 years with
<br>
genetically modified organisms,&quot; he adds. And that's a danger that
<br>
nanotechnology developers would like to avoid.
