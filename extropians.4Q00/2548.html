There are two new articles of interest in the latest New Scientist. One is a 
<br>
short article about the use of home power gas turbines and the very rapid 
<br>
development of fuel cell technology and use in the next 2-50 years. The other 
<br>
(which I just saw the title of, had to do with using oil and natural gas and 
<br>
coal and 'sequestering' the carbon-not a new idea to the energy mavens, but 
<br>
still timely.

<em>&gt; &gt; As someone who spent a number of years as an energy analyst,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; availability is upward. Stopy buying the Green lies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For heavens sake.  How is this supposed to convince somebody who's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually worried about energy depletion?  You might actually *change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone's mind* if you explained yourself!  :p
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; [Hint: Most Greens think that energy prices today don't tell you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything; that reflecting on prices and price trends today is like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jumping off a building and saying &quot;I'm not going to stop suddenly!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm going faster and faster!&quot;  Answering this (wrong, but initially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausible) intuition might actually do some GOOD.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Oh, you really are a mess, aren't you? Resources do not get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'destroyed'. They just get reallocated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Truuue, but just saying so isn't enough.  Oil *looks* like it gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroyed when it's used.  How will your comment change someone's mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about that intuition?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Every technological advancement allows the amount of resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; needed to produce every dollar of economic activity to decrease all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the time. Where do you think all the wealth of our economy comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from? It didn't just come from us trading iron and corn back and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forth and paying a wage.  Technology increases productivity, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decreases the amount of resources you need to live an ever higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; standard of living. Get off the Malthusian BS, he was disproven long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So instead of actually naming a technology or two, you just assert that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology will continue to increase our productivity.  Do you see why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this doesn't help?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but they were working from an ascending paradigm.  Extropianism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Gnosticism reversed, the exact same stand within a descending paradigm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No, its an ascending paradigm based on factual data.  I quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understand how you are so confused.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who's THAT supposed to convince?  Just *claiming* that your beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are based on facts is no argument!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, maybe you don't have time to give a reasonably complete list of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facts or supporting arguments or whatever.  But, if so, you didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually have time to provide a good argument.  And a bad argument is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much worse than no argument at all.
