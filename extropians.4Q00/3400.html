<em>&gt; &gt;I have to agree with Michael on this part at least.  Most rural

<em>&gt; &gt;you don't already fall into some category that has a well-deserved

<em>&gt; I'm sorry, but I can't buy this as a generalization.  When I was in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high school in rural Illinois, I saw local community members
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physically attack strangers because they were perceived to be gay,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Judging a community from the behavior of drunk young punks who that
<br>
community would just as soon put in jail (and likely has at least once
<br>
or twice already) is even less statistically relevant. I saw the same
<br>
behavior as you describe, in both directions, in the five years I lived
<br>
in Seattle, but I wouldn't say that Seattle was a hotbed of hate crimes.
