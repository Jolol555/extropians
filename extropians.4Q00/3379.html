<em>&gt; &gt;Isn't it interesting that the ethnic groups who have historically been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;banned from buying, owning, and using guns to defend themselves against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;tyrannical opression by governments are these days proponents of gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;control?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Okay, so its a gun thread now. We can pass it over to exi-freedom if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;anyone wants to continue it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had hopes, but I never thought I'd see the day, considering all the gunslingers in here who seem constitutionally hard-wired to have to fire the last shot.  Thanxabunch!
</em><br>
<p>You are welcome, but, sorry, Joe, you don't get to comment. You've
<br>
steadfastly refused to sign up for the exi-freedom list, so it seems
<br>
that you are in no way interested in discussing the issues, only in
<br>
being right (as well as getting the last word). I'll bet you can't even
<br>
stop yourself from responding to this post. ;-)
