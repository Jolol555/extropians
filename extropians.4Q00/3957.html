</em><br>
<p>In reviewing this discussion, it seems to me there may be
<br>
a misunderstanding of consciousness.  If we can accept
<br>
that William Calvin's model of the brain is correct, then
<br>
consciousness is a set of neurons that have agreed that
<br>
they have an image (or a model) of reality in which we view
<br>
ourselves as the primary actor.  In other words we &quot;perceive&quot;
<br>
ourselves as ourselves.  However, the key aspect of consciousness
<br>
must be the firing of the neurons, which in turn depends upon
<br>
the neuronal interconnections and synaptic strengths
<br>
(i.e. acquired memories).
<br>
<p>So whatever process gets used to copy &quot;you&quot; has to
<br>
copy or emulate both the functioning of the neurons
<br>
and their &quot;memory&quot;).
<br>
<p>Now, ignoring for the moment the &quot;quasi&quot; conscious state
<br>
of sleep, clearly individuals who have undergone surgery
<br>
where they have had their body temperatures lowered
<br>
sufficiently that their neurons stop firing, have &quot;lost&quot;
<br>
consciousness.  You are completely unable to perceive
<br>
yourself at all.  Yet we warm them such people up and for
<br>
the most part they recover with no difficulty.  I.e. consciousness
<br>
is rebootable (just like our computers most of the time).
<br>
So consciousness must be generated by the fact that
<br>
you can &quot;remember&quot; that you are you.  You are you because
<br>
you have your memory &quot;state&quot; information.  This is like
<br>
the fact that your browser can take you back to a place
<br>
you have visited on the net because it has a history
<br>
file remembering all of the pages you have visited.
<br>
<p>So, in fact a copy of you *is* you, at least upon intial
<br>
activation, simply because it perceives itself through its
<br>
memory that it is in fact you.
<br>
<p>So, I would tend to agree with the perspective that
<br>
while I too desire an evolved copy procedure so
<br>
I can preserve my sentimental feelings that I am
<br>
really me (and not my copy), I don't doubt that
<br>
a destructive readout copy is in fact really me.
<br>
<p>Since I'm partial to the perspective that sleep is a
<br>
very altered state of consciousness, it seems that
<br>
waking up is really a warm reboot.  If so, I'd suggest
<br>
that every day we are living as copies of ourselves.
