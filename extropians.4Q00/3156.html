<em>&gt; Not to fan any acrimony flames, but given that information wants to be

</em><br>
<p>When did information tell you it wanted to be free? (I hope you are not
<br>
hearing voices) Be honest: you are cheap, and want your information to
<br>
be free. Try not to identify too much with the object of your work. If
<br>
identifying with material inanimate objects is unhealthy, identifying
<br>
with immaterial inanimate objects is even more so.

<em>&gt; The evolution of cooperation stuff indicates that rough parity among all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; players is essential for cooperation to be a good strategy. Pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individualism in its rawest form is hard to distinguish from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pyschopathology unless the observer has confidence in the shared values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the observed. Think Mickey and Mallory in _Natural Born Killers_.
</em><br>
<p>There is a significant difference between individualism and
<br>
socio/psychological killers, liberty is not about nihilism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The mantra you mention is far from valueless to me. Please don't make me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your enemy just yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Principles *are* important. One principle that's important is not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burn the barn down while the horse is still inside.
</em><br>
<p>Its also important to not wait to send out your pickets until after the
<br>
enemy has stolen your horses.
