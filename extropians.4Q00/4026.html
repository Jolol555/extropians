Charles Darwin holds key to junk telecom bonds-Salomon
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Investors in battered junk-rated
<br>
telecommunications bonds may be able to achieve equity-like returns by
<br>
taking a
<br>
page from Charles Darwin and investing in the &quot;fittest&quot; of bonds, Salomon
<br>
Smith
<br>
Barney said in a report on Tuesday.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It will be 'survival of the fittest' in competitive telecom,&quot; Salomon
<br>
wrote. &quot;Bad markets do not last forever, and as these companies continue to
<br>
show operations and financial improvement, their values will improve as

<p>&quot;If you go back a hundred years,&quot; he explains, &quot;one of the biggest
<br>
scientific questions was 'what is life?' And one of the most prominent
<br>
theories had to do with vitalism--some substance, some thing that is
<br>
transmitted from cell to cell, animal to animal, that is the essence of
<br>
life. Well, you don't hear anybody talking about vitalism anymore. We've
<br>
come far enough to see all the mechanics--we've seen how DNA works, we've
<br>
seen all the pieces of the cell, and we don't have need for a hypothesis
<br>
like vitalism.&quot; So it will go, Sejnowski suspects, with consciousness.
<br>
(Phlogiston, incidentally, refers to a theoretical substance that people
<br>
once sought in combustible material, thinking it made up the &quot;substance&quot; of
<br>
fire.)
