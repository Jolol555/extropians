If you have live pets, and sometimes they are alone, then maybe the robots
<br>
could play with the cats and dogs.  Some people play the television or
<br>
otherwise provide input to their pets.  There are fish feeders to feed fish for
<br>
a week or two at a time, other pets require more interaction.

<p>I know older people that have a little statue of a dog or cat.  A robot would
<br>
be a good thing to have, they have ones to run the vacuum and otherwise.  One
<br>
time there was an online chat with Hans Moravec and we talked about it.  My
<br>
idea was to use mobile software agents so one agent would be able to interface
<br>
the vacuum cleaner and other plant machinery or that many could use it.
<br>
<p>Humans are pretty adapted to getting around, but a robot should be able to get
<br>
a round an ADA building in a not so difficult way.  Some robots move around
<br>
detecting the walls and make a map and then use global positioning.  I was
<br>
watching this on television, they also detected any people or other objects in
<br>
their path to stop or move around it.
<br>
<p>It would be a good task for a robot to be given a random group of objects and
<br>
have it pick them up and carry them around.  Computer vision has progressed as
<br>
a field in ways I know not.  Giving the robot stereo or even tri-scopic vision
<br>
would allow it to see from various perspectives, as would access to wireless
<br>
networked local intracams.  So, it could identify something without picking it
<br>
up, and then pick it up.
<br>
<p>On this list there is various talk about robots in the archives.  Robots could
<br>
be very small, or very large.  A software robot is a program that performs
<br>
repetitive actions.
