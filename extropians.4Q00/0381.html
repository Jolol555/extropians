<br>
I do think that the consensus is that to want to live is not evil, and
<br>
by exclusion things which terminate an enjoyable existance to be
<br>
evil. Quite axiomatic, or so I have thought.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; What benefit is there to us to have children?  What benefit is there to us
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to help citizens of distant foreign countries?  What benefit is there to
</em><br>
<p>Helping children is genetically encoded, because during critical phase
<br>
of hominization the only children in distress you ever saw shared
<br>
genes with you. Nowadays this ancient program still happens to make
<br>
sense, by virtue of global economy not being a zero sum game. Well
<br>
cared for children are likely to become productive players instead of
<br>
a burden. Well, at least that's my rationalization.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; us of helping animals?  If we like and respect and care about such creatures,
</em><br>
<p>I think this one is almost obsolete, since we're about to decouple us
<br>
from the global ecology. As soon as we don't automatically screw
<br>
ourselves by screwing up the ecosphere, helping animals becomes an
<br>
optional atavism. Because I don't like this attitude, I would like to
<br>
hear rational (i.e. other then &quot;microsoft, microfluffy, like a fluffy
<br>
ducky&quot;) reasons why this is only a skewed/part of the picture.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; then there's a benefit to us from helping them.  Similarly, if we like and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; respect and care about AIs, then there can be benefit to helping them.
</em><br>
<p>There's a difference. Our children won't eat us, AIs possibly
<br>
could. (Would you be nice to Giger's alien?) If AIs grow slow, there
<br>
would be sense for them to reciprocate us being nice to them. If they
<br>
grow fast, we're just reabsorbable scaffold. Until we know for sure
<br>
which bootstrap kinetics will occur I recommend caution.
