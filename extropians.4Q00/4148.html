Might the case for extraterrestrial life and the principle of
<br>
self-organization have new support?

<p><p>Are We All Aliens? The New Case for Panspermia
<br>

<br>
<p>Nestled safely inside the belly of a comet orbiting some unknown star, a
<br>
microscopic alien sits dormant. Somewhere in this vast universe -- perhaps a
<br>
place like Earth -- a greater destiny awaits the microbe. A place to
<br>
flourish, become a nematode or a rose or a teenager.
<br>
Life, after all, is tenacious and thrives on change.
<br>
Over time, gravity performs a few plausible, but not routine tricks, and the
<br>
comet is ejected from its stellar orbit like a rock from a slingshot. For
<br>
more than a 100 million years it slips silently across the inky vastness of
<br>
interstellar space.
<br>
Then gravity goes to work again. Another star tugs at the comet, pulls it
<br>
in.
<br>
A few giant gaseous planets whiz by, their bulks tugging at the comet,
<br>
altering its course slightly. Ahead now, growing larger, looms a gorgeous
<br>
blue and brown marble. Water and land. Maybe some air.
<br>
Then with the force only the cosmos can summon, the comet slams into the
<br>
third rock from a mid-sized, moderately powerful star. The alien microbe
<br>
survives, emerges from its protective shell and spreads like the dickens.
<br>
Thus began life on Earth, 3.8 billion years ago.
<br>
Or so goes one aspect of a theory called panspermia, which holds that the
<br>
stuff of life is everywhere and that we humans owe our genesis and evolution
<br>
to a continual rain of foreign microbes. It means, simply, that we might all
<br>
be aliens.
<br>
It's an idea that has been around longer than Christianity, but which still
<br>
struggles to gain strong support among most scientists.
<br>
But two recent discoveries are breathing new life into the theory.
<br>
One study, reported in the October 27 issue of the journal Science, shows
<br>
that a space rock could successfully transport life between planets.
<br>
Another group of researchers, reporting in the October 19 issue of Nature,
<br>
claims to have found and revived bacteria on Earth that were dormant, in the
<br>
form of spores, hiding in New Mexican salt crystals for 250 million years.
<br>
Scientists called the implications of this second discovery profound,
<br>
suggesting that if further study bears out the findings, it could mean
<br>
bacterial spores are nearly immortal.
<br>
And if you are immortal, then what are a few billion years of interstellar
<br>
travel?
<br>
&quot;Until recently, panspermia was not even regarded as a scientific
<br>
hypothesis,&quot; says Chandra Wickramasinghe, the concept's leading proponent.
<br>
&quot;Now that has changed.&quot;
