</em><br>
<p>Brooks has had good success with his little robots, and now he's trying
<br>
to build a humanoid robot.  As was pointed out earlier, a number of AI
<br>
labs are moving in this direction.
<br>
<p>I can see that there is practical value in making robots that can walk,
<br>
carrying things, etc.  But I can't help thinking that a significant
<br>
part of the motivation here is purely public relations.  People are
<br>
more interested in a robot which looks human, is able to nod its head
<br>
and smile, shake hands, etc.  Labs doing this work may get more funding
<br>
as a result.
<br>
<p>But is this really the right direction for AI research?  Recall what
<br>
the goal is: approximating human level intelligence.  AI is a cognitive
<br>
effort which seeks to create a mental architecture.  Giving a robot a
<br>
face and hands does not directly advance towards that goal.
<br>
<p>Researchers try to justify this work by saying that forcing the robot
<br>
(really, the researchers) to solve real world problems will require the
<br>
development of intelligent algorithms.  Some go so far as to say that
<br>
the reason AI has failed to make progress is because the evolution of
<br>
intelligence requires interaction with the real world in a real body.
<br>
<p>I don't buy this because it seems that AI is so primitive that there is
<br>
plenty of work that can be done in simulated environments.  It's not
<br>
like AI creatures are so smart that there is no more challenge there
<br>
and they're ready to move up to the real world.  The slow progress in
<br>
AI is because it's hard, not because of a lack of challenge.
<br>
<p>The problem with the current direction is that a great deal of time is
<br>
spent on mechanical tasks of layout, construction, lubrication and repair.
<br>
This is wasted effort in terms of trying out new cognitive structures.
<br>
It seems to me that this can only slow down AI progress in the long term.
<br>
<p>We are sacrificing true AI progress in favor of emotionally impressive
<br>
demos.
