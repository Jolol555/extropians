<em>&gt;Good points Harvey. I just have to quibble with this one...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 5.  Free Time:  We also work less time and have a lot of free time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That is a major difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Everything I've read says that we work more than ever, that the trend over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time has been for the amount of hours people spend working to increase,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather relentlessly. We may possibly this century be beginning to turn that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around... although with the 35 hour week fading from memory for most of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(yes, it used to exist here), I doubt it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hunter gatherers apparently spent about 2 hours a day in work-like (staying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alive related) activity, and from there it's gone downhill (I'll go dig for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an attribution).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>I've heard several similar reports and they're completely at odds with my 
<br>
personal experience. I work 40 hours a week in my current job, and up to 45 
<br>
on (rare) occassion. I get 18 days off per year at my own discretion, and 8 
<br>
holidays. Figure that all together with weekends and I work an average of 
<br>
about 5 hours per day throughout the year.
<br>
I remember seeing pictures of people at protests during the early days of 
<br>
union forming holding signs that said &quot;8 hours work, 8 hours sleep, 8 hours 
<br>
leisure&quot;, this being their goal for the ideal work day. For the most part, 
<br>
they have it, and a 5 day week. I do not have sources, but I think I can say 
<br>
that child labour is way down over the past century. I don't know how this 
<br>
statistic (of more work hours) was put together. Maybe they are averaging in 
<br>
0 hours for women who do not (and did not) work. This would obviously result 
<br>
in a much higher number for today since more women work.
