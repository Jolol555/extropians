<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Instead, Mr. Brin didn't really argue anything in a substantive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  manner.  The little snippets that almost looked like sub-arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  were so loaded with false dilemmas and straw men that I gave up any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  idea of pointing them all out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Then you missed the point of the article.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is missing the &quot;point&quot; the same as not buying into a fallacious argument?
</em><br>
<p>No.  It is fully possible to understand an article, and rationally
<br>
disagree with it.  This is much different than misunderstanding the
<br>
article, and disagreeing with an interpretation of the article that is
<br>
not, in fact, valid.  (Indeed, this latter is one form of a cause of
<br>
much anger in the world.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you feel that Mr. Brin's argument was sound, or is your support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more of a vague approval of his general theme?
</em><br>
<p>I believe his argument was sound given his premeses.  I also see some
<br>
merit in the idea of corrupting, as it were, the current government to
<br>
more libertarian ideas (as he puts it, &quot;evolution&quot; rather than
<br>
&quot;revolution&quot;) instead of devoting all resources to making government
<br>
irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; General themes and opinions are fine to have, but it's very important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to couch them as such.  Mr. Brin's language resembles more of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument, and since he is a professional writer, isn't it fair to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume that he knows what he's doing when he writes something for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; publication?  If so, then I hope you can understand why I'd want a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly sound argument before I'd agree with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As it is, his argument is overly loaded with fallacies.  Am I wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to then not just accept his conclusions as valid?
</em><br>
<p>The conclusions you objected to were not the conclusions of the article.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; He claims to be mostly a Libertarian, but he actually votes for Democrats.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Yep.  Because he believes that Libertarian aims can be more effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;achieved by improving the system - which requires working within it, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;thus working with The Powers That Be - than the current ideal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;destroying the system and starting over (which is presumably what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;L candidates he voted against were promoting).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He never explicitly mentioned voting &quot;against&quot; Libertarians.  He said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he voted &quot;for&quot; Democrats.  Whether that means that he wanted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vote for possible winners in a major party or he wanted to vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against a revolutionary LP candidate is unknowable from this piece -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find support for both positions.  They both seem equally likely so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking one side or the other would be special pleading.
</em><br>
<p>Technically, under most of the American political system (which, to my
<br>
knowledge, is what Mr. Brin votes in), a vote for one candidate for a
<br>
position (where only one person may fill that position) is a vote
<br>
against all others.  (I personally would not mind seeing that change,
<br>
but that is the reality for now.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Summary: passing and changing laws and instituations to promote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;individuality, rather than merely repealing/removing most or all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;existing laws and institutions, is an approach that the public is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;likely to vote into office.  It is also more likely to bring better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;results in practice, even if either one were equally able to gain power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To be clear:  Are you also espousing this &quot;Libertarian goals through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Democratic party&quot; philosophy?
</em><br>
<p>No, *he* is.  (And it's not through the Democratic party per se; it is
<br>
through existing government - including both Republicrat parties.)  I'm
<br>
just trying to clarify his argument.  While I can see merit in this
<br>
idea, I have not given it nearly as much thought as he has, so I am
<br>
probably not nearly as comfortable with it as he is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If so, could you explain a little more in detail about how promoting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the political party that believes in bigger government, higher income
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxes, a de-emphasis on personal property, less personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility, and severe gun control will obtain the benefits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the party that believes in minimal government, no income taxes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stronger property rights, higher individual responsibility, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protected gun rights?
</em><br>
<p>I believe his reply to this would be to change the parties' beliefs.
<br>
For instance, getting libertarian (or even Libertarian) candidates to
<br>
challenge current Democrat or Republican candidates for their own
<br>
parties' nominations, rather than running as independent candidates or
<br>
working to take down the system entirely.  Now, how to do this
<br>
successfully without becoming corrupted by or beholden to Republicrat
<br>
interests is another issue, but he seemed to believe that this would be
<br>
the easier path...
