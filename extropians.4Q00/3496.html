<em>&gt;Chris Russo boldly asked:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;What makes you you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Besides the physical characteristics that I think that we can all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;agree upon are copied down to the smallest detail, the mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;characteristics define who we are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You're assuming Cartesian duality, I take it, in that you assume the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and mind to be two separate entities. This is only true if you regard the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mind to not be comprised of &quot;physical characteristics.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry, I didn't mean to imply that there was some non-physical 
<br>
aspect of the mind.  I can see how what I wrote could be read that 
<br>
way.  I was only trying to explain that if I were copied into a new 
<br>
being, that the physical aspect - how high I can jump, what I look 
<br>
like, etc. - would be one component that would be of some importance 
<br>
to me, but who I *really* am is defined by my thoughts.  The thoughts 
<br>
are determined by the chemistry of the meat, though.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt;Basically, my &quot;mental characteristics&quot; are comprised of memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I have and the neural algorithms that drive my thoughts, as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;any capacity to support those algorithms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;True, true, but are these not physical characteristics? Are you familiar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the idea of &quot;synaptic plasticity&quot; in memory cells and the assignment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of weights in neural networks?
</em><br>
<p>I was trying to define &quot;me&quot; in more than just in terms of the 
<br>
hardware (in this case organic).  If you run the above definition on 
<br>
some future quantum computing hardware and it still roughly worked 
<br>
the same, it would still be &quot;I&quot;.  I probably went too far in trying 
<br>
to define the importance of separate aspects of the same physical 
<br>
thing, and then just confused my stance on this position.  Too much 
<br>
crack, I'd guess. :)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt;Copy the mental and physical &quot;me&quot; exactly, and there's no real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;distinction between the two. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is where you run into some serious trouble (more serious than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophical trouble). First of all, by nature of the definition of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;copy,&quot; there is a definite distinction between the two, in that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a usually quantifiable spatial sepation between the two entities which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prevents them from being one in the same thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Take for example a correlative analogy between the dynamics of an exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;replica of you and, for the sake of application to computer science, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exact copy of your Windows 98 platform transferred to another computer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Say your biological replica, which is NOT you (because it moves to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Congo in an attempt to avoid the concept of dualism while you remain in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Western Civilization) and your Windows 98 copy both are infected with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;viruses - your replica gets ebola while your Windows gets a virused copy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of this email.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Up until this point, assume both copies might have the same dynamics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unaffected by environment (which is untrue from the first millisecond
</em><br>
<em>&gt;after the copy is made). Therefore, arguably (with a really compelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;argument) there would be no &quot;real&quot; distinction between the two. After your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;replica comes down with ebola, however, you can bet there will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;observable-measurable-quantifiable changes in you and your replica,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distinguishing the two on many levels. Same goes with the Windows 98
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example. After a week or so, the difference will be great enough that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be functional and the other will not.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what you're arguing here.  I concur that if both the 
<br>
original and copy exist that they will diverge from one another. 
<br>
What conclusion are you drawing from that?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;You also said something earlier to the effect of sentimentality hindering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the acceptance of the idea that me and my replica have different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousnesses,
</em><br>
<p>No, I said that if you're restored from a just-made backup at the 
<br>
moment of your destruction, you have effectively the same 
<br>
consciousness, and that any feeling that your continuity has been 
<br>
eliminated is sentimentality.
<br>
<p>Note the question in my post regarding use of a futuristic 
<br>
teleportation device that is essentially destroying then recreating 
<br>
you from information.  I may have sentimental problems about losing 
<br>
my original meat, but my continuity is maintained.
<br>
<p><p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
