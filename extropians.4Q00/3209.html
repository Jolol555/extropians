<em>&gt; I mean, really, haven't you ever freaked a mundane? You know what I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about, don't you?
</em><br>
<p>I remember convincing a girl at a uni party that I really, truly, wanted to
<br>
replace all my bodily biological goop with &quot;robotic&quot; parts, no matter how
<br>
freaky, as long as they confered excellent advantages. Basically, becoming a
<br>
cyberman (for all Doctor Who fans out there, although I would remove the
<br>
weird vulnerability to gold dust). When she realised that I really meant it,
<br>
she bugged right out - she was a jingly jangly, bells on the ankles anthro
<br>
student.
<br>
<p>Let's here 'em; the freaking-the-mundanes story
<br>
<p>Emlyn
<br>
(btw, before someone pulls me up on the derogatory tone that I'm using to
<br>
refer to my fellow humans, lovely darlings that they are, just remember that
<br>
I could have called them danes, humbots, all kinds of 'orrible nyms.)
