<em>&gt;Subject: Two great articles on ignoring government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Thu, 23 Nov 2000 01:20:39 -0000
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Two of my heroes are Larry Flynt and Dr. Kevorkian. Both of them treat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;absurd laws (against obscenity, and against ownership of your own life) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with open defiance. I'd like to ultimately see government whither, by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;method of people just not taking it seriously. This happens once in a while 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but the people who do it usually end up suffering. In Flynt's case, he got 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;away with it, though fairly bruised. Kevorkian, currently in prison, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't seem to be getting away with it. I hope these two are the Galileos 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a trend which will ultimately cause the government to whither down to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the size that the Catholic Church has. You'll know it's a serious trend 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when you see large corporations openly ignoring violations of their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedom. Here are two things I've read which make me think, and hope, that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this is starting to happen.
</em><br>
<p>Hear, hear! Tey are two of my heroes as well. World class contrarians 
<br>
destined to go down in history.

<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/18/business/19TAX.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/18/business/19TAX.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is an article about how several companies are refusing to take income 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tax, social security, and medicaire deductions from their employees' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paychecks. They are also refusing to report their employees' incomes to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;IRS. So far, they all seem to have gotten away with it, according to this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;article. My favorite parts of the article:
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree with not paying taxes. It's true that gov't is not as good as 
<br>
it could be, but it really what brought us to the dance, that and science. 
<br>
What we need to do is make gov't OUR servant, instead of the other way 
<br>
around.
