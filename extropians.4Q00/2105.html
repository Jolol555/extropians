<p>
Dear Natasha,
<br>
<p>Thank you for your kind suggestions concerning my web-site.
<br>
<p>Please keep in mind the following:
<br>
<p>1) There is not a single website in Italian that is dedicated to 
<br>
extropianism, transhumanism, cryonics or the singularity. If you or anybody 
<br>
else know otherwise please let me know, I’d be genuinely *delighted* to be 
<br>
proved wrong and to find out where those sites are.
<br>
2) As a consequence of 1) my main priority is to start from the very basics 
<br>
and translate into Italian a few transhumanist documents. Given that this is 
<br>
not a full-time effort I intend to keep it simple. Hence the low-tech look 
<br>
of the site. For now, I’d rather concentrate on the *ideas* (I’ll throw in 
<br>
the “dash of panache” if and when I have the time). Please note that I am 
<br>
most definetively (and clearly) not a web designer and that IMHO life’s too 
<br>
short to learn HTML…
<br>
3) You said: “Do it with precision” ? Sorry, I can live with the fact that 
<br>
you clearly don’t think much of the site, but this is more serious. Does not 
<br>
mentioning your interview with Italian newsmagazine L’Espresso represent 
<br>
lack of precision? In what way? The site is two weeks old and has minute 
<br>
amounts of material on it at present. In that context, do you really think 
<br>
your interview should have been my main priority out of all the 
<br>
transhumanist material out there?! Anyway, the main thing is: *it’s already 
<br>
in Italian!* Furthermore, while a very positive development, it is only two 
<br>
short paragraphs… 
<br>
(<a href="http://www.espressoedit.kataweb.it/cgi-bin/spd-gettext.sh?ft_cid=39190">http://www.espressoedit.kataweb.it/cgi-bin/spd-gettext.sh?ft_cid=39190</a> ) 
<br>
and the Extropy Institute is mentioned as the “Extropian Institute, a 
<br>
Californian istitute involved in longevity”. You also say “it seems strange 
<br>
to me that you emphasize the WTA FAQ which has some flaws and 
<br>
inconsistencies which I don't believe have been corrected yet. Someone 
<br>
should have explained this to you.” Let’s gliss over the patronising tone. 
<br>
You miss the point that I am offering a *translation* of an original 
<br>
transhumanist document to the Italian public, warts and all. Have a word 
<br>
with the WTA if you think changes should be made. How would you like the 
<br>
Extropian Principles translated in another  language with arbitrary 
<br>
modifications thrown in by the translator? Also, I started from that because 
<br>
it is a good general intro to a number of subjects dear to extropians and 
<br>
because extropianism is a subset of transhumanism and not viceversa. More 
<br>
will follow (any suggestions welcomed), but it’ll take time.
<br>
4) Extropic art: I am not much interested in -or much impressed by- what I 
<br>
have seen of extropic art. Call me a philistine if you have to, but extropic 
<br>
art is very low on my list of priorities for the site.
<br>
5) Italy and art. You say “Oh my, and you want to appeal to Italians? In 
<br>
that Italy is known for its arts and culture, it would seem to me that one 
<br>
way to spread extropic memes would be to encourage creative thinking in the 
<br>
cultural arena.” Fine, but, like many foregneirs that go to Italy attracted 
<br>
by it’s artistic heritage, you seem to have a romanticised and stereotypical 
<br>
view of Italians, the level of their interest in art and the local arts 
<br>
scene.  You’ll see what I mean if you try to think of three living Italian 
<br>
artists that would be generally known outside Italy - or by non-Italians on 
<br>
the list. I can only think of writer Umberto Eco (a few years ago it would 
<br>
have been different, you could have mentioned Fellini, Pasolini, Modigliani… 
<br>
all dead and sadly not replaced by a new artistic generation). That gives 
<br>
you an accurate idea of the Italian arts scene at present.
<br>
<p>Finally. Thanks for your offer of help and for suggesting your book on the 
<br>
history of transhuman ideas, but I am still at the stage where I am trying 
<br>
to expose people to those ideas, in most cases for the first time. 
<br>
Recounting the history of those ideas might follow, but at a much later 
<br>
time. In the meantime I’ll  translate the Extropian Principles and as much 
<br>
as I can on cryonics and the singularity. Soo little time, so much material 
<br>
to translate…
<br>
<p>Take care.

<br>
<p><p>Original message from Natasha
<br>
<p>Allora. This is a bit startling to read. Although I applaud your efforts and 
<br>
I think it is wonderful that you have taken on the task of spreading memes 
<br>
alla Italy, prego - do it with precision and a dash of panache. Extropians 
<br>
and Extropic Art were recently featured in a leading Italian magazine. 
<br>
Perhaps you missed this? I posted it to this list just a few weeks ago, I 
<br>
believe. This is important and you should reference this article because it 
<br>
was a cover story with excellent journalism. I wouldn't be surprised if this 
<br>
story gets picked up by other Italian periodicals. Also, it seems strange to 
<br>
me that you emphasize the WTA FAQ which has some flaws and inconsistencies 
<br>
which I don't believe have been corrected yet. Someone should have explained 
<br>
this to you. Also, I checked out your links and no where do you mention any 
<br>
of our Web sites that pertain the Arts and Culture, the Transhumanist 
<br>
Statement (re culture) or the Extropic Art Manifesto. Oh my, and you want to 
<br>
appeal to Italians? In that Italy is known for its arts and culture, it 
<br>
would seem to me that one way to spread extropic memes would be to encourage 
<br>
creative thinking in the cultural arena. This is not to discount or place 
<br>
less emphasis on technology and science, but when too much emphasis is place 
<br>
on the latter an imbalance occurs that is neither helpful to our culture nor 
<br>
our goals. If you want to get the history of transhuman ideas accurately, 
<br>
and I trust you do, then please refer to my book which is easy to read and 
<br>
translate. If you need assistance, please write to me privately. My 
<br>
suggestion to you clearly reference our culture from an inclusive 
<br>
perspective and transhuman history (which I can provide) or which ExI is 
<br>
also working on.
<br>
<p>Thank you, Natasha Vita-More
