Subject: RE: Marriage!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I agree with J.R.Molloy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Without biology, marriage looks quite ridiculous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And with the new discoveries in genetics, evolutionary psychology, our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Adapted Mind&quot; (great book) and us being &quot;Moral animals&quot; (good one too),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even less.
</em><br>
<p>In response to this marriage discussion, here is a summary of
<br>
my &quot;Crossmatching&quot; (Quorums) notion ... a post-human
<br>
alternative to monogamy-monotony!
<br>
<p>Instead of the 'couple' or 'pair-bond' being the core unit of
<br>
humanoid society, the drive towards complexity, flexibility
<br>
and freedom might lead to the rise of the 'quorum' as the
<br>
living unit of choice.
<br>
<p>If you think that RELATIONSHIPS are, on the whole, a &quot;good thing&quot;
<br>
rather than a &quot;bad thing&quot; then quorums are a good idea since you
<br>
TRIPLE the number of intimate relationships for each person but
<br>
only DOUBLE the number of people (4 instead of 2)! A degree in
<br>
Logic is not needed to work this out.
<br>
<p>A quorum could be 'themed' in the sense that members might
<br>
be drawn together by a shared interest (Enochian Chess,
<br>
bridge, rock band or something). I was once in a company called
<br>
Quorum Ltd, with four of us sharing a house, and having
<br>
common business interests. It is possible that the quorum might
<br>
become &quot;immortal&quot; - in the sense that it outlives all of its founders.
<br>
<p>If one member decided to move on, the unit itself would not
<br>
break down as with a couple, and the other three could
<br>
decide to look for a replacement.
<br>
<p>* There is an economy of scale for housing expenses (see
<br>
www.co-ownership.com).
<br>
<p>* Child-care becomes more distributed and so less of a burden, and extra
<br>
skills are available within the relationship.
<br>
<p>* Another benefit is that sexual diversity within the quorum prevents
<br>
boredom,
<br>
and makes it less likely that members will look outside of the relationship.
<br>
If you already have two girlfriends and a boyfriend, or two boyfriends and a
<br>
girlfriend (or whatever), any more seems to me greedy and excessive!
<br>
Just about any sexual permutation is possible from a group of four!
<br>
