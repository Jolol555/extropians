Responses, broken down by person to whom I am responding.
<br>
<p>From: &quot;Jerry Mitchell&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jmitch12@tampabay.rr.com?Subject=Re:%20Random%20thoughts,%20more%20or%20less%20P.R.&In-Reply-To=&lt;852569B3.006B033C.00@notes.cbis.com&gt;">jmitch12@tampabay.rr.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>This was more or less explained by Damien Broderick (this is what I get for
<br>
opening this discussion on a list with a whole lot of really bright people), but
<br>
basically you're 'stealing' property which belongs to everyone. It's more or
<br>
less analogous to you staking a claim to all or part of a local city park. It's
<br>
considered to be common to all (and this idea is very old, it shows up in the
<br>
old testament) and the rich are considered to have taken more than their share.
<br>
<em>&gt;Property is theft? How can anything be &quot;stolen&quot; from anybody when no-one can
</em><br>
own anything?
<br>
<p>No, private property isn't a system, but it's part of a philosophical/political
<br>
system. Private property doesn't exist in nature, as such, but is a concept
<br>
created by humans. It's a tool, as is philosophy, economics, politics, etc.
<br>
They're all tools we created to more easily gain some goals. Should the tools be
<br>
more important that actual people? No, I don't think so. But then, what I think
<br>
isn't the issue, really.
<br>
<em>&gt;Private property isnt a &quot;system&quot; as your implying... Its the right to life ,
</em><br>
made concrete.
<br>
<p>You're equating a human construct (the idea of private property) with a physical
<br>
law of nature (gravity) and then you call this nonsense? Also, I never said the
<br>
universe was subjective, just that 1) There are a whole lot of questions to
<br>
which there are no definitive/universally accepted answers, despite what some
<br>
people assume, and 2) See my answer to Samantha's 1st reply about reality.
<br>
<em>&gt;You premise here is that standards are not objective. I havent met a person yet
</em><br>
that doesnt follow the standard of gravity. I &gt;can sum up this nonsensical line
<br>
of thinking this way. If you want to say that the universe is subjective, then
<br>
you just tried to &gt;make an objective statment about the universe. Naturally this
<br>
is self contridictory.
<br>
<p><p>From: Samantha Atkins &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20Random%20thoughts,%20more%20or%20less%20P.R.&In-Reply-To=&lt;852569B3.006B033C.00@notes.cbis.com&gt;">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>You seem to assume something I don't think is true, that an objective reality
<br>
exists (which I think is true) AND that we all 'know' what it is (which I don't
<br>
think is true). Reality may be 'objective' in some sense, but people's personal
<br>
reality IS subjective. The best we can do is trust our senses to be correct and
<br>
try to keep getting closer to aligning our perceptions with the outside world.
<br>
What do I mean? An atheist and a fundamentalist Christian watching a human birth
<br>
(for example) are going to perceive 2 separate things. One is going to see a
<br>
'miracle' proving God's gifts (or some such) and the other is going to see a
<br>
'perfectly natural' event. Now, did the same thing actually occur? Yes, but
<br>
you'd have to be outside and above them (and the rest of us) to know what.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since they go into the events with different beliefs, they're going to
<br>
process what they see differently (they'll focus on different parts, making one
<br>
thing more important that another, labeling them differently,etc.) Now, will
<br>
each of them think THEY have the answer, and (probably) that the other is
<br>
mistaken in their interpretation of events? Yes. Who's right? I'd set forth my
<br>
own answer and why, but it's not relevant. The point is that you can talk about
<br>
the event, and you're going to get 2 people who 'saw' the same thing, but come
<br>
nowhere near close to the same explanation. Is reality objective? You get to
<br>
decide that one for yourself, and no one else. (Of course, my answer there gives
<br>
away my own opinion, I think)
<br>
<em>&gt;objective reality to fall back on to reach agreement.
</em><br>
<p><p>Again, you're assuming the answer in your response. Why would I have to admit
<br>
anything, since 'admit' implies you already have the answer and I'm either
<br>
incapable of seeing it or lying? If a person doesn't believe something to be
<br>
true, why should they 'admit' to it? Thievery implies that it was rightfully
<br>
theirs, and what I'm pointing out is there is at least one consistent philosophy
<br>
which says it wasn't.
<br>
<em>&gt;Being required to do service for others without pay or compensation or choice
</em><br>
is as close to being enslaved as I want to &gt;go.  At the least you would have to
<br>
admit this is thievery of another's time, energy and resources.
<br>
<p>By the justice notions of a large number of people, actually. A whole lot of
<br>
people think we all owe something to the society in which we live, since they
<br>
see us as getting value from it. Where you're reared is largely not something
<br>
over which you have control, and tell me that living in the U.S. doesn't confer
<br>
material benefits over any 3rd world country (Yes, I realize I'm assuming
<br>
material benefits are good)
<br>
<em>&gt;But by what notions of justice?  This itself is a much more prejudicial and
</em><br>
questionable use of words than what you are &gt;calling me (and libertarians
<br>
generally) on.
<br>
<p>If you're asking me, personally, Yes. But, then I'm not talking about me.
<br>
<em>&gt;So if he has no right to it but you are forced by government to comply anyway
</em><br>
then your rights have been violated.  Yes?
<br>
<p>No, it's not pointless, it IS the point. My point is, and has been, that you
<br>
start from a place different from where others start, and then complain they
<br>
don't wind up in the same place. Why did I say Christ and not Krishna? Because
<br>
I'm from the U.S., meaning I've got different basic ideas that would someone
<br>
from India. Again, there's my point.
<br>
<em>&gt;Sure.  By that basic assumption Christ was God.  But then so was Krisna and
</em><br>
many others by the same logic.  OK.  It is a &gt;pointless aside.
<br>
<p>So, you're saying human nature is ALWAYS one way or another? Or that your
<br>
definition of human nature encompasses everything? Is your standard of helpful
<br>
the same as a Christian Scientist's? Why or why not? What do you mean by best
<br>
ways? You don't need absolutes, but you and I had better agree on how to judge
<br>
something before discussing it, don't you think? And, what happens when you're
<br>
'rights' come into conflict with my 'rights'? Who judges fairly? How, by what
<br>
standard? What if you and I don't agree?
<br>
<em>&gt;But that doesn't mean that within a context one can say nothing at all is
</em><br>
certain. Human beings are creatures with certain &gt;basic nature and
<br>
characteristics. In the context of human beings there are ways of treating them
<br>
that are more or less
<br>
<em>&gt;helpful.  I will only argue that libertarian values are more helpful than most
</em><br>
when construing the best ways of humans &gt;inter-relating.  I don't need absolutes
<br>
to make that case.
<br>
<p>You're still dead, that's what I mean. If we can prevent that from happening, is
<br>
that not more desirable than fighting over who was right, afterwards?
<br>
<em>&gt;Meaningless?  In the face of blatant human stupidity like that above it is
</em><br>
essential.
<br>
<p>And yet, others would disagree with you. So, who's right? And, by what standards
<br>
do you gauge?
<br>
<em>&gt;I do believe that property in many realms of ideas, especially software, is
</em><br>
theft however.  Or not exactly theft, but that applying &gt;property notions to
<br>
software diminishes us and our abilities.
