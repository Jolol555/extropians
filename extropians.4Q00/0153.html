BRAIN CHILDREN
<br>
Humankind has been thinking about the thought process--and how to remake
<br>
machines in its own image--for centuries.
<br>
<a href="http://www.redherring.com/mag/issue49/print.html">http://www.redherring.com/mag/issue49/print.html</a>
<br>
&quot;Why do people like to think machines can't?&quot; Disney's Marvin Minsky likes to
<br>
ask. Samuel Butler (1835-1902) phrased the question more fully more than a
<br>
century ago: &quot;Why should not machines ultimately become as complicated as we ...
<br>
at any rate complicated enough to be called living, and to be indeed as living
<br>
as it was in the nature of anything at all to be?&quot; Butler was the Victorian
<br>
satirist who wrote Erewhon, which describes a hidden land whose inhabitants
<br>
attempted to suspend history in order to prevent the evolution of machine
<br>
intelligence. In 1863 he published an essay on the evolution of technology
<br>
called &quot;Darwin Among the Machines.&quot;

The best thing in Bots is University of Maryland computer scientist Ben
<br>
Schneiderman, a savage critic of this philosophy: &quot;For those who built stone
<br>
idols or voodoo dolls or the golem or Frankenstein, it's long been a dream....
<br>
But no mature technology resembles [animal] form. Automobiles don't run with
<br>
legs, and planes don't flap their wings.... You need to know that if you issue a
<br>
command, you're going to get an exact and repeatable operation.... The data
<br>
rates you can get by pointing, clicking, and dragging are a hundred to
<br>
one-thousand times faster than natural language typing or voice.&quot;
<br>
Anthropomorphized agents, Mr. Schneiderman finishes, are &quot;things that think for
<br>
people who don't.&quot;
<br>
Alas, there are plenty of those. Because human consciousness does have limited
<br>
bandwidth, agents could mediate a world of endless information. Many
<br>
functions--like telling the house to dim the lights--would be more easily done
<br>
through speech-based interfaces. In fact, the day approaches when invisible
<br>
servants will speak to us from the very air. Microsoft Bob was ridiculed,
<br>
although it was only an experimental first step into the marketplace, hardly
<br>
equivalent to pre-MS-DOS efforts. Office 97's cartoon Assistants are a clear
<br>
advance. The Jesuits, no slouches at child programming, used to boast that if
<br>
they were given a child before six, the adult was theirs for life. In October,
<br>
as this review was written, Microsoft released an interactive Barney aimed
<br>
straight at that preadolescent market. The same month, the company bought a $45
<br>
million stake in Lernout &amp; Hauspie, a Belgium-based specialist in voice-enabled
<br>
computing. (For more on speech-recognition technology,
