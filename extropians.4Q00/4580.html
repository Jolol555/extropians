<p>I haven't seen Asimov's criticism; how interesting. I was going to mention
<br>
that movie but thought people on this list would probably dislike its
<br>
humanist critique of ostensibly melioratist but actually power-hungry
<br>
scientism (although they shouldn't). What John failed to mention is that
<br>
it's a faithful rendition of a [lesser] Ursula K. Le Guin novel, and she's
<br>
one of the greatest sf writers of all time. What's more, she was writing
<br>
that novel to some extent as a hommage to Philip K. Dick, and I still think
<br>
it's the best PhilDick movie made so far.
<br>
<p>Another movie nobody's mentioned is DEATH WATCH (LE MORT EN DIRECT), dir.
<br>
Bernard Tavernier in 1979, with Harvey Keitel as a cyborged TV reporter, in
<br>
a nearly deathless near future, whose job is to follow and observe/report a
<br>
dying woman using his built-in eye camera. Bleak and moving, more adult
<br>
than practically any other sf movie I've seen. It's based on a quite good
<br>
novel by D. G. Compton, THE CONTINUOUS KATHERINE MORTENHOE, aka THE
<br>
UNSLEEPING EYE.
