<p>I think not Zero.  Evidently sexual orientation and
<br>
sex drive are not much adjustable.  Too bad, otherwise
<br>
nerds could reprogram ourselves to find flab sexy.
<br>
Then we would have it made, eh?  {8-]
<br>
<p>As for putting credence in CR, Roy Walford made
<br>
an interesting comment at extro4.  He said with the
<br>
results of Biosphere 2 and some of the primate data
<br>
then coming available, it would be difficult to find after
<br>
about 1992 any gerontologists who would argue that
<br>
CR is not effective in prolonging life.  The experts in
<br>
aging all generally agree that CR works.  The research
<br>
is in how to get the *benefits* of CR to a proletariat
<br>
that likes to EAT.
<br>
<p>It has been a trend in medicine for doctors to interfere
<br>
less and less with one's chosen lifestyle.  In the old days
<br>
doctors would sternly lecture patients on living right.
<br>
Now they generally dont do that anymore, they just try
<br>
to make us as healthy as possible given our lifestyle
<br>
choices.  We already know that if we eat light, live right,
<br>
sleep 8, do everything in moderation, we will be healthier.
<br>
Hell, the religion incorporated crowd was preaching that
<br>
nearly two centuries ago.  We dont need a doctor to tell
<br>
us that.  We want PILLS that let us live wrong and still
<br>
be healthy.  Until that  pill is invented, I will continue to
<br>
do CR.
<br>
<p>So no, there is no real debate anymore on CR.
<br>
It works.  The question is how to not do it and still
<br>
live longer.
<br>
<p>One more point.  In my discussions with people, I find
<br>
that few people concern themselves with trying to add
<br>
an addional decade to their lives, damn few.  It is really
<br>
popular with *this* crowd because we grok the notion
<br>
of accelerated change: if we can just pick up a feeeewww
<br>
mooore yeeeears, then better medical technology will
<br>
come along and amke us heros, giving us maaaany more.
<br>
But Im one of the nanoheretics who suspects that strong
<br>
nanotech and/or singularity (within weeks of each other,
<br>
regardless of who gets there first) is a good 35 to 40
<br>
years off, which will put me at 75 to 80 years.  Friends,
<br>
we are standing on the threshold of a dream.  I envy
<br>
those cluey extropians and transhumanist who are 20
<br>
years my junior.  So I stay hungry, as J.R. suggests.  spike
