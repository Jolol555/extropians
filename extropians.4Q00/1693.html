<p>I have yet to see a video game that can simulate both the recoil and noise. 
<br>
The best way to learn to shoot is to go out and shoot, for real. Simulators 
<br>
are not close enough to reality, yet.

<p><em>&gt;The US population exists at the sufferance of the US military until such time

</em><br>
<p>As long as our rule of law keeps the military from taking control of the 
<br>
government, I am not worried about widespread use of tanks and planes. 
<br>
Although, we must remember Waco.
<br>
<p>Actually, armed civilians can make life pretty miserable for an invading 
<br>
army - domestic or foreign - with just small arms and improvised weapons. 
<br>
Tanks and planes are no match for guerilla fighters that can vanish into 
<br>
the population or the woods. A tank can be disabled by a properly placed 
<br>
satchel charge, for instance, if the attacker has the guts to run up behind 
<br>
it. A fighter plane can be brought down by a cheap ground to air missile 
<br>
(which will become available on the black market should our country ever go 
<br>
to a dictator). Viet Nam should have taught us something.
<br>
<p>Besides, where is the average Joe gonna keep his new toys? My neighbors 
<br>
would complain instantly were I to try to pave a 15,000 foot runway here, 
<br>
and Harrier jets drink way too much fuel for my budget. Ever try to get 
<br>
replacement parts for a modern tank?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No, actually the whole idea is that nanotech/AI/superintelligence scenario is

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be human.  Arguably, firearms - and to an even greater extent, martial arts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- are a part of that.  The question, as always, is time.
</em><br>
<p>Someday, we will have personal shields of nanobots that can deflect attacks 
<br>
by other nanobots and possibly chemical and biological attacks as well. I 
<br>
do not see how any nanotech could ever deflect a bullet - so the mope with 
<br>
a gun will be able to kill or injure someone with high-tech defenses for 
<br>
quite a long time into the future.
