</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Oh I also need a real good example of the anti gun zealot explaining what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the gun crime statistics were before and after each gun law was passed.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; includes statistical proof of all the successes they have had over the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred years.  Chicago, New York and a number of other cities virtually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outlaw all guns.  Can you get me the statistics before and after to show me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how the anti gun laws reduced crime?
</em><br>
<p>Well, I did not say that above, that was our inimitable Joe Dees.
<br>
<p>Thats the thing though, they can't. They just keep yapping their yaps in earnest
<br>
devotion to Goering's law about repeating lies often enough (Joe being a prime
<br>
example of this, though not quite so virulent as most) in hopes enough idiots
<br>
will buy it.
