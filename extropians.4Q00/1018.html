<p>Thanks for the comments, Damien.  Just to give you a background, the logo
<br>
is supposed to be the Phoenix, rising from the ashes (as I'm sure you
<br>
surmised). The human figure in the middle was added when Alcor moved to
<br>
Arizona, since the original logo was almost *identical* to the logo for
<br>
the City of Phoenix. 
<br>
<p>Alcor is in the beginning stages of an image and marketing overhaul, so
<br>
your comments are actually helpful.  Any other comments are welcome.
<br>
<p>You are right, though, and it bears reminding that people can see the
<br>
strangest things, especially if you are being subtle.  Or they are just
<br>
ignorant.  I remember once, living in rural Georgia (U.S.), mentioning
<br>
casually to someone that my wife had once been a member of the SCA. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Wots that?&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;A medieval recreation society&quot;
<br>
<p>Step backward.  &quot;Medieval...you mean like satanist?&quot;
<br>
<p>On that note, in the U.S., ever since the movie -The Omen-, the name
<br>
&quot;Damien&quot; has taken on similar connotations (ironic, given Father Damien's
<br>
work with the lepers).  Ever get any comments?
