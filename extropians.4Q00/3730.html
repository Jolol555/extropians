<em>&gt;Trying to develop a theory of consciousness based on position is a bad
</em><br>
idea.
<br>
<em>&gt;Where does consciousness exist? If it's inside my head why don't I
</em><br>
understand
<br>
<em>&gt;what it's like to float in a liquid encased in a dome made of bone? I
</em><br>
assure you
<br>
<em>&gt;I don't know what that's like, and I sure don't feel that's where &quot;I&quot; am.
</em><br>
Feeling and
<br>
<em>&gt;thinking is what consciousness is all about so that pretty much ends the
</em><br>
matter
<br>
<em>&gt;as far as I'm concerned. Where does &quot;old&quot; exist? Where does &quot;fast&quot; exist?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Where does the number &quot;11&quot; exist? Where does consciousness exist?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;These questions have no answer because they  make no sense
</em><br>
<p>Everyone involved in this discussion is flailing about hopelessly
<br>
because M.V.T. is the correct (thus only) solution to the mind-body
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p>The brain manifests a phantom pineal eye. Phantoms (limbs &amp;c)
<br>
do not &quot;exist&quot; in space separate from the brain, but the feelings (of &quot;I&quot;)
<br>
are where they are felt. The phantom toe is felt as if it is from a foot
<br>
that
<br>
is no longer present. Undetectable by science, but subjectively very real.
<br>
<p>It is very obviously and indisputably true that any circuit (brains
<br>
included)
<br>
*must* include at least some infinite-state capacity in order to
<br>
self-organise.
<br>
Circuits governed by external clock/ lock-step mechanisms are finite-state.
<br>
The pineal eye functioned as an external clock (proven by experiments) and
<br>
&quot;consciousness&quot; or self-control of behaviour (independent from solar
<br>
command)
<br>
happened in evolution only since the pineal eye disappeared.
<br>
<p>End of discussion (unless someone can refute MVT or has a more complete
<br>
account of consciousness ...... and don't come back with supervenience or
<br>
any
<br>
purely verbal theories ... an evolutionary account is needed, consciousness
<br>
wasn't
<br>
magically created by God).
