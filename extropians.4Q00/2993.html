</em><br>
<p>You've pointed to an important service of government. In addition to the
<br>
military industry, what about the banking industry? If the government
<br>
didn't &quot;prop up&quot; banks by providing police protection, gangs of thugs with
<br>
machine guns could take over all the banks. (wait, maybe they already did
<br>
that when I wasn't looking -- Bankster.com ?)
<br>
I don't think that means banks don't deserve to exist. (They may not
<br>
deserve to exist for other reasons, but not particularly because of
<br>
government &quot;propping up&quot; their security.) The same argument applies to
<br>
practically all industries at least to some degree. Without government
<br>
&quot;propping up&quot; Microsoft, bands of well-armed thieves could have taken over
<br>
all Bill's campuses long ago.
<br>
Anyway, you're not going to keep government from propping up industries.
<br>
The primary education industry (public education) would evaporate without
<br>
propping up by government. In this case, I might agree that this
<br>
particular industry does not deserve to exist.
<br>
&quot;Hey, teacher! Leave those kids alone!&quot; --Pink Floyd
<br>
<p>And don't forget the prison industry. Does it deserve to exist? Probably
<br>
not. But government doesn't need to prop up such a lucrative (and sick and
<br>
wrong and ugly) industry. The privatization of US incarceration stands to
<br>
enslave tens of millions instead of the one million it presently does.
<br>
Investors are not difficult to find.
<br>
As for Gnutella, I don't think the problem relates to the dearth of
<br>
content, but rather with a lack of vision. Someone needs to present an
<br>
outline of what the new economy will do to improve the human condition,
<br>
not just how it will make money for infrastructure and content providers.
<br>
