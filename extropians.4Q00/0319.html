<p>&lt;&lt; The fact that some may try to defend what they are doing by calling
<br>
&nbsp;it capitalism is simply inaccurate.   I am a capitalist, I am also a Union 
<br>
electrician, incompatible with your statement above.  Brian  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Brian, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you have to distinguish between Capitalism at the Macro level and 
<br>
at the level of the individual businessman.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a capitalist society with a capitalist government no one except the 
<br>
government is allowed to initiate the use of force and that against only the 
<br>
invader and the criminal after due process.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing in that process says that the individual businessman has to 
<br>
be a capitalist in personal philosophy.  That individual could possibly be 
<br>
member of a number of personal philosophies but if they can not get away with 
<br>
using force, coercion or deceit the only tools left to them is free trade.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally I have worked for individual businessmen that were complete 
<br>
scoundrels personally but could not effectively get away with that behavior 
<br>
given our laws and courts.  He made a business of contracting for work and 
<br>
his best workers knowing him would demand, and got, pay in advance before 
<br>
they would go to the job.  The man was still operating as a capitalist even 
<br>
though he really didn't want to - he couldn't get away with anything else.
