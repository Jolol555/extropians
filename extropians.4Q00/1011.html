I was just thinking about the comments regarding the failings of Slash, vs
<br>
email. I'm not a great fan of slash, or web based forums, either; they look
<br>
pretty, but they can be slow and clumsy to use.
<br>
<p>Even though email is a bit of a dinosaur, it's strength is in it's
<br>
distributed nature. We all have our own client programs, chosen by
<br>
ourselves, to organise our mail as we see fit. This has the benefits of
<br>
being accessible offline, being faster, and being vastly more customisable.
<br>
<p>On the other side, email is dodgy; you can lose messages for various
<br>
reasons, you need to handle backing up yourself, and your mail tends to be
<br>
hidden away on one machine; certainly it's less accessible than a
<br>
centralised, web-based system.
<br>
<p>What would be ideal would be a combination. If you could do Slash, but have
<br>
an email version, so that people could receive it if desired, possibly
<br>
easily linking the emails back to the slash site by embedded urls, then we
<br>
might start to have something more useful.
<br>
<p>Alternatively, how about a custom client, which presents the &quot;slash&quot; style
<br>
forum, but stores messages locally if desired; then you could use it
<br>
offline, post while offline, have faster access, etc. Maybe this is just a
<br>
slicked-up news group?
<br>
<p>A very agreeable hybrid is any site which has a headline mailing list, so
<br>
that the audience can subscribe to headlines, and click in the email to view
<br>
full  posts online. The only news type websites that I frequently visit are
<br>
those with this functionality, and I always go via the headline emails. Has
<br>
Extrodot got any plans along these lines? Personally, it will make the
<br>
difference between me never visiting it, or checking it's content once a
<br>
day.
