<em>&gt; &gt; It seems to me the most extropic people have either avoided marriage,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tolerated it as a necessary evil, or abandoned it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm thinking of Socrates, Turing, Galileo, Oscar Wilde, Siddhartha, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's because these were all gay.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another fun fact:  Plato's &quot;Platonic love&quot; (taught from Socrates) was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really non-sexual.  He was espousing the virtues of homosexual love over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heterosexual love.  The catholic church took out all the sexual referenceswhen they translated the classics from Latin.
</em><br>
<p>Galileo, AFAIKR, found his primary relationship with is daughter, who was a nun
<br>
in a convent, and who was as well educated in astronomy as he was. Whether there
<br>
was anything between them beyond the father daughter thing (as some snarkily
<br>
surmise) I don't know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For bonus points:  Why did Plato think that gay relationships were superior?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was not just his own preferences.  Under the Roman Empire, only men were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; educated, could own land, could run businesses, or could be citizens.  Plato
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was actually arguing that an equal relationship with an intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partner, a business partner or fellow citizen was more satisfying than an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unequal relationship between a Master and his servant girl or concubine.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was arguing that men would be happier if they chose partners for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual, business or political savvy rather than just for procreation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or domination.
</em><br>
<p>Women were illiterate for the most part in Greek society, little more than
<br>
chattel. Most all significant social and personal relationships among Greek
<br>
intelligentsia were between males, and I presume that since such intelligent
<br>
males had such difficulty finding 'intelligent' educated women to have true
<br>
relationships with that the homosexual relationship was resorted to.
