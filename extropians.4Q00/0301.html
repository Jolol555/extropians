<p>A person who enlists due to the weakness of their pride, ego, etc., being afraid
<br>
of what people would think if they did not serve, and too wimpy to declare
<br>
themselves a concientious objector, then gets into combat and refuses to stand
<br>
by his comrades who are risking their lives to save his ass from the enemy, yes,
<br>
by damn, that person IS a coward. There is no other word to describe such a
<br>
person.
