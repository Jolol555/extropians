Neuroprotective signaling and the aging brain: take away my food and let

It is remarkable that neurons are able to survive and function for a
<br>
century or more in many persons that age successfully. A better
<br>
understanding of the molecular signaling mechanisms that permit such cell
<br>
survival and synaptic plasticity may therefore lead to the development of
<br>
new preventative and therapeutic strategies for age-related
<br>
neurodegenerative disorders. We all know that overeating and lack of
<br>
exercise are risk factors for many different age-related diseases
<br>
including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancers. Our recent studies
<br>
have shown that dietary restriction (reduced calorie intake) can increase
<br>
the resistance of neurons in the brain to dysfunction and death in
<br>
experimental models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease,
<br>
Huntington's disease and stroke. The mechanism underlying the beneficial
<br>
effects of dietary restriction involves stimulation of the expression of
<br>
'stress proteins' and neurotrophic factors. The neurotrophic factors
<br>
induced by dietary restriction may protect neurons by inducing the
<br>
production of proteins that suppress oxyradical production, stabilize
<br>
cellular calcium homeostasis and inhibit apoptotic biochemical cascades.
<br>
Interestingly, dietary restriction also increases numbers of
<br>
newly-generated neural cells in the adult brain suggesting that this
<br>
dietary manipulation can increase the brain's capacity for plasticity and
<br>
self-repair. Work in other laboratories suggests that physical and
<br>
intellectual activity can similarly increase neurotrophic factor
<br>
production and neurogenesis. Collectively, the available data suggest the
<br>
that dietary restriction, and physical and mental activity, may reduce
<br>
both the incidence and severity of neurodegenerative disorders in humans.
<br>
A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying
<br>
these effects of diet and behavior on the brain is also leading to novel
<br>
therapeutic agents that mimick the beneficial effects of dietary
<br>
restriction and exercise.
