<p>I can't speak for others in this thread or any back-slapping, and I'm 
<br>
a little hurt that I haven't been congratulated for being cool - but 
<br>
I will say that Mr. Brin's essay puts forth a number of opinions in a 
<br>
rather self-congratulatory yet unsupported manner.
<br>
<p>That kind of essay is bound to generate discussion.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  You are judging that David Brin is no good but obviously you know the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't know if it's so much that David Brin is &quot;no good&quot;.  So far, 
<br>
all I have to go by is his essay posted to this forum and his web 
<br>
page, which I visited briefly.  Both demonstrate a decided lack of 
<br>
appreciation for logical argumentation, which is what I've been 
<br>
harping on.
<br>
<p>Others have been pointing out their own experiences with perceived 
<br>
flaws in Mr. Brin's ideology.  Is that not allowed here?
<br>
<p>You might want to join in the discussion in a meaningful way, rather 
<br>
than just criticizing the participants for having it.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
