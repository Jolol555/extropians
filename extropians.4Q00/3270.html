<p>Well, there was the time some Southern Baptist relative asked me if I
<br>
believed in God.  I said that I believe that an intelligence and
<br>
technology more than powerful enough to do everything (not utterly
<br>
contradictory) in the Bible not only can but will come to be eventually
<br>
somewhere.  And that if that intelligence manages to transcend time and
<br>
if time-travel does not imply creating alternate universes, then such a
<br>
being could in fact meaningfully be said to exist right now and to
<br>
meaningfully claim to be &quot;Alpha&quot; and &quot;Omega&quot;.  I was not very nice.  I
<br>
made it worse by explaining exactly how most of the miracles of Christ
<br>
could be performed with nanotech.  :-)  Around that point they started
<br>
looking for the number of the Beast.
