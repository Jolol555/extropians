<p><em>    &gt;Name me any finite-state components that can readjust their logic in

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;A thermostat.
</em><br>
<p>A thermostat is set to switch on or off at a given (preset)
<br>
temperature. It cannot decide to override this setting, so
<br>
does not make this &quot;decision&quot; internally. So this example
<br>
could not be more wrong. Finite-state, yes, infinite-state
<br>
capacity ... definitely not! If a thermostat can alter its own
<br>
settings, then it is infinite-state by definition.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;I say you can't because finite-state  means  pre-set switching.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Nonsense, Turing showed in 1930 that you the only way to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what a Turing machine is going to do is run the program and see,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and a Turing machine is finite state unless it runs for an infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amount of time.
</em><br>
<p>Turing machines are neither conscious, nor infinite-state.
<br>
Digital computers tends to be finite-state, whereas analog(ous
<br>
to infinite-state) evolvable hardware is more like our brains.
<br>
I cite Inman &amp; Thompson's work with R.G.A. circuits at COGS,
<br>
University of Sussex.
<br>
<p>Turing machines are hard-wired and cannot evince PHASIC
<br>
TRANSIENT behaviour ... correct me if I am wrong? R.E.M.
<br>
as I would claim is a random-like phenomena because E-1
<br>
brains are still (in long evolution terms) changing from finite to
<br>
infinite-state.
<br>
<em>    &gt;Consciousness requires a degree of self-organisation.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;You mean like amorphous mater molecules forming into a crystal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when things get cold?
</em><br>
<p>For a start, we are talking about brains here ... and brains have/
<br>
require a degree of plasticity. Inhibition and other effects allow the
<br>
neuronal circuitry of the brain to change .. so the brain is
<br>
self-organising.
<br>
Your water example is meaningless.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>    &gt; I don't want to get bogged down in semantics here .... so I claim that
</em><br>
REM
<br>
<em>    &gt;(rapid eye  movement) indicates dream mentation.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;You are free to claim whatever you like but I asked how are you going to
</em><br>
prove
<br>
<em>&gt;I'm conscious. You still haven't answered me. And even in the unlikely
</em><br>
event
<br>
<em>&gt;the &quot;lost pineal eye&quot; is somehow important, who cares, how would that
</em><br>
&quot;fact&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;effect the debate we were having in the slightest degree?
</em><br>
<p>The debate seems to centre on the problems resolving Leibnitz Law ...
<br>
that to be truly &quot;identical&quot; the two things in question must be fully
<br>
interchangeable. Sense-data (experience) and the conscious sensor/ self
<br>
seem to be different types ... this is the problem for brain-mind identity
<br>
theorists. However, MVT explains the virtual sensor(gan), the phantom median
<br>
eye,
<br>
which gives the persistent experience of self in terms of generation (action
<br>
potential
<br>
signals &amp;c) of the *same* generic neuronal information as the sense-data
<br>
(contents
<br>
of consciousness).
<br>
<p>This is a major reason why MVT is important, most theories of mind
<br>
(including
<br>
Descartes' dualist account) fail on this point. Brains are necessary, but
<br>
not
<br>
sufficient for consciousness (they could be in mu-state ... don't you
<br>
agree?)
<br>
<p>As to whether I can *prove* that you are conscious (whoever &quot;me/ you&quot; are)
<br>
... I don't want to get bogged down in individual cases because of the
<br>
problem
<br>
of solipsism. Do you accept that dreams happen? If you do, then you are
<br>
allowing me that the dreamers (in general, whether birds, mammal, or *you*)
<br>
have consciousness.
