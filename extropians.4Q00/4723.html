Damien Broderick said some stuff:
<br>
<em>&gt;At the end, this goose does the equivalent of Homer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Simpson plagiarizing his way into a job running a nuclear reactor. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clear implication to me is that the space mission will be dangerously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compromised by his actions, just as badly as if someone with a major heart
</em><br>
<em>&gt;condition joined a polar expedition, but hey, why should *he* be left out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the fun?
</em><br>
<p>You expected something else from Hollywood? :)  I did wonder the same 
<br>
thing, though.  The doctor who knew about the problem could very well 
<br>
be responsible for destroying a billion dollar mission and killing a 
<br>
bunch of astronauts.  Ah well, equality of outcome in action for you.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This stupid plan turned out to work because his superior brother
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*unaccountably in terms of the agreed conditions* ran out of puff on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extended outward journey (even though he still had nearly enough reserves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to get back to shore), and godhelpus was then towed in, coughing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gasping and drowning, by the feeble brother, who presumably Used the Force.
</em><br>
<p>This was a bit of a stretch, but what movie doesn't have a stretch 
<br>
here and there.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Its drastic improvements *won't* be amenable to being bested
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by grit on the past of the old fashioned unmodified, any more than a guy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with a megaphone and all the determination in the world can better be heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at cross-continental distances than one with a radio transmitter.
</em><br>
<p>See, here's where I think you disliked something within the movie 
<br>
that actually wasn't there - a cinematic straw man, if you will.
<br>
<p>These GM human beings weren't supermen.  They were just like the rest 
<br>
of us, but with a few rough edges removed.  A congenital heart defect 
<br>
was remedied here, bad vision was corrected there.  The users of this 
<br>
technology were merely fixing a few human bugs and making innocuous 
<br>
choices for the parents (like eye color), not creating super mutant 
<br>
freaks.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
