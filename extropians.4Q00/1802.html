<em>&gt; Any cornfed domestic animal will have much higher fat and cholesterol levels

</em><br>
<p>Grain finished beef tastes better and is more tender, regardless of the

species of grain used.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know the biochemical differences between corn and other grains like wheat or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rice, but it is the newest major domesticated grain, and thus the least likely

</em><br>
<em>&gt; or healthfully.
</em><br>
<p>Corn is at least 7000 years old versus wheat/barley ~10000. I don't think
<br>
that's a big difference. And, of course, humans and animals ate the wild
<br>
varieties long before they were domesticated.
<br>
<p>American farmers use corn to finish cattle for one reason: cost.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can understand the draw, as I appreciate the taste of a couple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ears of ripe Butter and Sugar corn in a nice fall barbecue, but I'm sure if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given the chance I'd develop a taste for crack if I could legally buy a dozen
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; domesticated grains, and nearly as bad for you as cane sugar.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you say that? As far as I can tell, corn, barley, and rice are
<br>
strikingly similar, nutrionally. For example, see:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://waltonfeed.com/self/ntr3.html">http://waltonfeed.com/self/ntr3.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Just out of curiosity--I don't doubt your word--but what measurable benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can you attribute to cutting out 5-10% beef?  And what is the basis of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; percentage: calories of total diet, protein by weight, or what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't tell you any specifics. I cut it out, and I'm now much better for it. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't count calories or weigh myself, as I don't want to develop any obsessive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors in my diet... It is, though, difficult to not notice a difference in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waist size of four inches.
</em><br>
<p>OK, that's great, but you haven't identified the basis of the 5-10% number.
<br>
5-10% of *what* by *what* was beef?
