<p>
Something I've had a major issue with for a very long time (since I was 
<br>
affected by this particular worldview, in fact), s the tendencies of
<br>
cultures to treat children as property.  This principle is enshrined
<br>
in English at least (maybe someone else knows if the word 'disowned'
<br>
carries the same connotations in other languages).
<br>
<p>Many laws predicate on this principle - including and especially those
<br>
that deal with the right of children to work, to own property, and to 
<br>
ener into legal, binding agreements.  A child until the age of 16 in the
<br>
US cannot enter the workforce legally, no matter how competent they can
<br>
prove themselves (unless it's farm labor, in which case the lower limit 
<br>
is 14).  If they CAN find work, most banks in the US won't allow them to 
<br>
open a savings or checking account without a parent's signature (and 
<br>
therefore the parents' authority to withdraw money from that account 
<br>
at will), so the obviou and easily accessible means of keeping asserting
<br>
control over one's own life is denied.
<br>
<p>Children in the US are treated as non-citizens - even felons have more 
<br>
rights than a 16 year odl in this country.  A child is not covered by the
<br>
core rights enshrined in the constitution, even those that are designed 
<br>
to thwart abuses by the state (children in public schools are subject to 
<br>
all manner of abuses - from blatant censorship of unpopular views or those
<br>
critical of the authority figures, to unrestricted, warrantless searches of
<br>
their person and possessions.)  Is it any wonder that children growing up
<br>
today are often more apathetic towards the continuing erosion of their 
<br>
rights?  These are the people who will eventually be voting, and policing 
<br>
our streets, and making our laws.  It seems we're instilling in them a 
<br>
very Machiavellian mindset - and no one in a policy-making position seems
<br>
to notice or care.
<br>
<p>(personal rant warning, skip if you'd like)
<br>
<p>The question of who gets to school a child is also critical, and one where
<br>
this mindset is very apparent.  If a parent chooses, their child will be 
<br>
schooled wherever the parent pleases - even if that means that a child's 
<br>
formative years are spent under the watchful eye of a priest or minister, 
<br>
who works to assure the child's indoctrination in their particular brand
<br>
of freedom from critical thought.  The damage from this sort of 
<br>
indoctrination can last a lifetime.  
<br>
<p>(end personal rant)
<br>
<p>I will freely admit to not knowing how to overcome this particular 
<br>
mindset, but as to the damaging effects I'm sure it's fairly clear.  Any
<br>
<em>&gt;H means of childrearing may wish to take this idea into account.  If we
</em><br>
expect children to grow up into adults that respect the rights of others, 
<br>
we need to treat them with care - &quot;Do as I say, not as I do&quot; is no longer
<br>
acceptable - I'd dare say it's fascism in progress.
