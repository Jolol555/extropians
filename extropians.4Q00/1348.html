<p>Actually, some people do talk about men's right to choose.

<p>If gun laws in fact worked, the sponsors of this type of legislation should have
<br>
no difficulty drawing upon long lists of examples of criminal acts reduced by
<br>
such legislation. That they cannot do so after a century and a half of trying --
<br>
that they must sweep under the rug the southern attempts at gun control in the
<br>
1870-1910 period, the northeastern attempts in the 1920-1939 period, the
<br>
attempts at both Federal and State levels in 1965-1976 -- establishes the
<br>
repeated, complete and inevitable failure of gun laws to control serious crime.
