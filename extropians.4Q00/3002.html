</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire planet.  If a couple cables were in orbit, they could generate

</em><br>
<p>I think there are problems with stability in such a structure.
<br>
<p>I've read that if you had a *rigid* ring, it could not be in orbit.
<br>
One side or the other would tend to drift downwards.  It wouldn't make
<br>
any difference if it were rotating or not.  Of course this is only for
<br>
an idealized, perfectly rigid ring, and no solid materials could be
<br>
particularly rigid at the size scale we are talking about.
<br>
<p>For a flexible ring, I think the problem is that if the orbit is slightly
<br>
elliptical, as any true orbit will be, the particles of the ring want to
<br>
move faster during the lower part of the orbit.  This will compress the
<br>
ring in some portions and stretch it elsewhere.  I suspect that this
<br>
energy transfer will cause the ring to become deformed and to collapse
<br>
into the atmosphere eventually.
<br>
<p>You could possibly fix these problems with active elements, little rockets
<br>
or perhaps solar mirrors to monitor the position of each ring element
<br>
and herd it back into the desired configuration.  But this would add
<br>
greatly to the complexity of an already difficult project.  25000 miles
<br>
of cable of any practical thickness is going to be a mighty big spool.
<br>
<p>Also I'm skeptical of this &quot;deionizing fields&quot; concept, because a cable
<br>
moving parallel to it own length won't cut any magnetic field lines and
<br>
so won't generate any significant currents.
