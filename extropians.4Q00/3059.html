The New York Review of Science Fiction, which was published in slightly
<br>
different form:
<br>
<p>========================
<br>
<p>*Genesis* by Poul Anderson 
<br>
New York: Tor Books, 2000; $23.95 hc; 256 pages
<br>
<p>reviewed by Damien Broderick
<br>
<p>Stanislaw Lem, the great Polish polymath and sf writer/critic, published
<br>
*Fantastyka i Futurologia* in Cracow in 1970. It included a long discussion
<br>
of Olaf Stapledon's magisterial 1930 novel *Last and First Men* and its
<br>
even grander sequel *Star Maker (1937)*.[note 1] Lem critiques several
<br>
aspects of Stapledon's two billion year future history, noting almost in
<br>
passing that its repeated total regressions in technological progress are
<br>
implausible, constructed only for the literary motive that taking into
<br>
account genuinely expectable change would have made it impossible to write
<br>
the novel.  
<br>
<p>Vernor Vinge would independently rediscover what he would term the
<br>
Singularity more than a decade later (in his *Marooned in Real-Time*,
<br>
1986).[note 2] Lem wrote:
<br>
<p>[start indented block]
<br>
<p>But let us keep in mind that another vision, in which the species'
<br>
cataclysmic degeneration is not so profound - in other words, in which
<br>
there would be some continuity in the current of civilizational
<br>
transformations - would have made it impossible to write the book. For the
<br>
ascent that follows exponentially from this premise would surpass the
<br>
capacities of any artist's imagination. This means that even if the fate of
<br>
humanity is not at all tragic, we are incapable of plausibly foreseeing -
<br>
in the very distant future - different qualities of being, other than the
<br>
tragic... But the existence of future generations totally transformed from
<br>
ours would remain an incomprehensible puzzle for us, even if we could
<br>
express it.
<br>
<p>It is a law of civilizational dynamics that instrumental phenomena grow at
<br>
an exponential rate. Stapledon's vision owes its particular form and
<br>
evenness to the fact that its author ignores this law... Technological
<br>
development is an independent variable primarily because its pace is a
<br>
correlative of the amount of information already acquired, and the
<br>
phenomenon of exponential growth issues from the cross-breeding of the
<br>
elements of the mass of information... His cautious pen never drove the
<br>
narrative to `techno-orgiastic escalation'... (pp. 285-7)
<br>
<p>[end indented block]
<br>
<p>Vinge realized this much later, eventually creating a Zoned universe, in *A
<br>
Fire Upon the Deep* (1991), that allowed certain restrictions on routine
<br>
and swift technological transcendence - allowing him, as well, to create a
<br>
rip-snorting yet principled space opera. Lem's entire discussion is worth
<br>
reading for its nuance as well as its priority. His scathing criticism of
<br>
the failure of imagination of Western sf is now rather dated, happily, but
<br>
still applies to most `consumer fodder' science fiction. 
<br>
<p>His own apparent lapse of imagination - that proviso, `in the very distant
<br>
future' - is compensated by his insistence that *already* we have achieved
<br>
most of the great technical breakthroughs expected by Stapledon no sooner
<br>
than millennia or even millions of years hence. `[T]he moment of the
<br>
chromosome structure's discovery cannot be separated by &quot;long millennia&quot;
<br>
from an increase in knowledge that would permit, for example, the species
<br>
to direct its development' (p. 285). He even preempts Vinge's metaphor of
<br>
an event horizon of prediction: `[Stapledon] has invalidated the real
<br>
factors of exponential growth, which obstruct all long-range predictions;
<br>
we can't see anything from the present moment beyond the horizon of the
<br>
21st century' (p. 287). 
<br>
<p>No less remarkably, perhaps, Lem made a cognitive leap still seldom seen, I
<br>
believe, in most futurism. There are reasons to doubt his conclusion, but
<br>
it is an impressive leap of connective imagination:
<br>
<p>`Predictions beyond 80 or 100 years inevitably fail. Beyond that range lies
<br>
the impenetrable darkness of the future, and above it, a single definite
<br>
sign indecipherable, but impinging on us all the more: the Silence of the
<br>
Universe. The universe has not yielded to the radiance of civilizations; it
<br>
does not scintillate with brilliant astro-technical works - although that
<br>
is how it should be, if the law of psychozoic beings were an aspect of the
<br>
exponential ortho-evolution of instrumentality in cosmic dimension.' (p. 288)
<br>
<p>Must we assume that cosmic superintelligences, whether AI or augmented
<br>
organic beings, future human or past alien, would place their stamp
<br>
detectably on the physical universe? In Arthur C. Clarke's *The City and
<br>
the Stars* (1956), advanced intelligences re-position seven different
<br>
coloured stars to form a ring in the heavens. They might not be so modest.
<br>
Emblematically - since They might be impelled by aesthetic whimsies as
<br>
readily as by economic imperatives. Consider a fragment from a recent
<br>
Australian young adult sf novel (please forgive the self-indulgence):
<br>
<p>[start indented block]
<br>
<p>Now the sun was definitely brighter.  In the year 2,173,698,172 its furnace
<br>
was burning harder, and according to Daddy it was more than ten percent
<br>
hotter than in our own time... The earth was empty again...
<br>
<p>`Oh my god,' Dad said, as the first stars began to prick out in the heavens.
<br>
<p>`Funny way to set up your satellites,' I muttered...  `They must have built
<br>
more of those orbital rings and stuck them everywhere.  You'd think they'd
<br>
bang into each other.'
<br>
<p>`Not satellites, darling.  Those are stars,' Daddy said, and came and sat
<br>
down beside me on a shelf of cooling rock, putting his arm around me
<br>
tightly.  `That's what they've done to the stars.' The sky was a vast
<br>
curving criss-cross grid of points of hard light, like atoms seen from
<br>
inside a crystal.
<br>
<p>Someone had actually revised the sky.  Somebody had come in and moved the
<br>
stars around.  Some Mind had reached out and flicked the billions of
<br>
burnings suns of the Milky Way as if they were some kid's marbles.
<br>
<p>`A moiré pattern,' Dad mused.
<br>
<p>`A what?'  I looked at the changed universe with horror, but also
<br>
wonderment...  
<br>
<p>`It's a spherical grid,' Dad was saying in a frail voice, `all the stars
<br>
have been moved to locations at regular intervals on a series of concentric
<br>
spheres,' but I hardly heard a word.  I just looked and looked, and you
<br>
could see places where the spots of brilliance ran together, which was just
<br>
where the lanes of light overlapped in the endless dark deeps of galactic
<br>
space.  The Milky Way itself was gone, its billions of stars relocated into
<br>
the grand crazy rational design.  But you could pick out the core of the
<br>
galaxy, because that was the brighter place that the endless onion skins of
<br>
stars wrapped themselves around.
<br>
<p>`Wow,' I said.  `Oh, wow.' [note 3]
<br>
<p>[end indented block]
<br>
<p>All this as prelude to Poul Anderson's interesting attempt to confront that
<br>
basic and almost unsurmountable fact about the far future. Technological
<br>
time will be neither an arrow nor a cycle (in Stephen Jay Gould's phrase),
<br>
but an upwardly accelerating curve. It will pass through what Vinge terms a
<br>
Singularity and what I call the Spike. [note 4] Unless self-inflicted
<br>
disaster inevitably reduces intelligence to ruin and global death, it is
<br>
plausible that consciousness will proliferate, mutating and extending its
<br>
own capacities, perhaps replacing its very substrates - relocating itself,
<br>
for example, from limited organic bodies to very much more adaptable
<br>
synthetic forms (discussed by Hans Moravec in his recent astonishing book
<br>
*Robot*). [note 5] Poul Anderson, like Fred Pohl and other sf writers
<br>
steeped in the ever-revised history of the future, is familiar with
<br>
Moravec's extrapolations, and builds them gracefully into his own saga of a
<br>
galaxy a billion or more years farther off into deep time.
<br>
<p>An earlier version of *Genesis*, a 100-odd page novella, appeared several
<br>
years ago in Gregory Benford's uneven anthology *Far Futures*. Anderson's
<br>
tale was perhaps overshadowed by Greg Egan's extraordinary &quot;Wang's Carpets&quot;
<br>
in a competing volume, Greg Bear's anthology *New Legends*: a
<br>
post-Singularity story so uncompromising that it seeded his remarkable
<br>
novel *Diaspora*, probably the most rigorous posthuman sf work yet published. 
<br>
<p>Now Anderson extends his story of Gaia's plans for ancestral Earth
<br>
threatened by a swelling, terminal Sun. The vast, immanent AI custodian and
<br>
consciousness of the world, Gaia rather frighteningly wishes to allow the
<br>
world to perish in final flame rather than disrupt the `natural'
<br>
astrophysical trajectory. Other mighty Minds throughout the galaxy, and to
<br>
the `shores of the Andromeda', find this plan perverse. One such godlike
<br>
node, Alpha, hives off a sub-mind (still Olympian by our standards), and
<br>
sends Wayfarer to Earth to investigate and intervene. A still more
<br>
diminished aspect or agent of this fragment, a reconstruction of the early
<br>
upload engineer Christian Brannock (merely a human-scale genius), visits
<br>
the planet as his larger self communes and debates with Gaia. What he
<br>
finds, inevitably, is baffling yet emotionally moving (in its constrained
<br>
way), recalling those Norse sagas Anderson loves so well. 
<br>
<p>And all of this impossibly remote story is told to us as myth, as
<br>
repeatedly distanced construct. We are informed again and again that what
<br>
we read is nothing like the vast reality (as of course must be so, given
<br>
the premises of ruthlessly projected futurism). `All is myth and metaphor,
<br>
beginning with this absurd nomenclature [Alpha, Wayfarer]. Beings like
<br>
these had no names. They had identities, instantly recognizable by others
<br>
of their kind. They did not speak together, they did not go through
<br>
discussion or explanation of any sort, they were not yet &quot;they&quot;. But
<br>
imagine it' (p. 112).
<br>
<p>And we do, for we have been here before. This is the grand proleptic
<br>
mythology of Stapledon himself, of Roger Zelazny's `For a Breath I Tarry'
<br>
(1966) - in which Machine remakes Man, but there bows before Him (which is
<br>
absurd and sadly farcical, however much we loved that story in the 1960s).
<br>
In this revised version of his myth, Anderson eases our entry to allegory
<br>
via several well-formed episodes from the comparatively near future: a
<br>
boy's epiphany beneath starry heaven, in our Earth; Christian's empathy
<br>
with his robotic telefactor extension on Mercury, prelude to his own status
<br>
as an uploaded and finally multiply-copied personality; English bureaucrat
<br>
Laurinda Ashcroft who plans the first millennial salvation of Earth from
<br>
the brute assaults of a heedless cosmos; a small, neat parable of rigid,
<br>
gorgeous clan rivalries held in check and paralysis, finally, by the
<br>
emerging Mind of Gaia. These are Anderson's antinomies again (and perhaps
<br>
American sf's): the sacred autonomy of the self, the craving for
<br>
transcendence in something larger; personal responsibility, and its
<br>
terrible limits in a world linked, defined, by a billion threads.
<br>
<p>Returned to Earth, Wayfarer's Brannock and Gaia's Laurinda tarry in 18th
<br>
century civility, falling in love (of course), driven together and apart by
<br>
a series of visitations to simulated histories as dense and real and
<br>
tormented and doomed as the `real world'. Their own personalities are no
<br>
less constructed (of course), however rooted in some small early reality,
<br>
and so the poignancy of their dilemma is the greater. But for us, knowing
<br>
that we read a fiction, and fetched in a kind of postmodern gesture again
<br>
and again by Poul Anderson from our comfortable readerly illusion, these
<br>
figures and their worlds run the risk of all allegory: can we care? 
<br>
<p>It is the great artistic problem for any form of art that expects utter
<br>
disruption. Religious art faced it long ago, and clad its transcendent
<br>
message in parable, majestic song - and quietness, sacralized domesticity,
<br>
anguish transformed at the graveside. These are territories Poul Anderson
<br>
has trodden in all his work, more so, perhaps, than any of his peers. Now
<br>
he confronts the Singularity, reaching to these well-honed tools to give
<br>
himself voice and range, and perhaps he succeeds as well as anyone can
<br>
manage - given that the task is impossible. I suspect he does not, however.
<br>
It might not be his fault, if so: it might be that it takes an entire
<br>
culture to sustain such myths. Sf has begun to grow the myths, but
<br>
meanwhile the world's culture turns them into jingles and plastic toys. It
<br>
will be interesting to see how the genre, the mode, of sf responds to this
<br>
immense new perspective. For now, Poul Anderson has made a brave early
<br>
foray into its pitiless depths.
