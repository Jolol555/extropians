</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>But nothing other than a human body and one significantly like this one
<br>
would run &quot;my program&quot; &quot;correctly&quot; if &quot;correctly&quot; means
<br>
indistinquishable from the original.  The context is quite different.  I
<br>
doubt any of us would argue that strongly that all that is meaninfully
<br>
&quot;I&quot; is contained in the pattern of information and interconnections in
<br>
the brain with no references to the brain it is embodied in or to the
<br>
surrounding environment at all.  The question then is how much of me is
<br>
and is not recordable and re-instantiable.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Although the programming may be the important part of consciousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is not alive unless it is running correctly (or mostly correctly).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would even argue that a decapitated head contains most if not all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the same information that the live head had moments before.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has the same software, hardware and memories, but it is still not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working copy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This implies that we need FIVE characteristics of a good copy:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         - Hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         - Software
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         - Data (or memories)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         - Activity (not halted or crashed)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         - I/O ports for sensory perception
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         - Self Awareness (maybe?  hard to define?)
</em><br>
<p><p>Plus perhaps context that the program interacts meaningfully with and
<br>
structures itself in relation to.  Memories of context are not
<br>
sufficient.  I/O ports without meaningful context (meaningful to the
<br>
software/hardware) are perhaps insufficient.  Quite a bit of the
<br>
structuring of our consciousness is based around meat-brain experiences
<br>
and metaphors.  It is at least questionable whether that structure would
<br>
work much less be internally perceived as &quot;me&quot; in a non-meat brain
<br>
context.
