<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Working in Vermont as I do, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the current Civil Union controversy raging, it has turned out that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the overt 'hate' crimes committed here since the 'Take Back Vermont'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grassroots campaign began were actually committed by gays trying to gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sympathy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BULLSHIT.  That statement reeks of unsupported claim.  And I know my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people better than that.
</em><br>
<p>I can mail you the newspaper clippings of the confessions. You have
<br>
blinders on, as there is nothing that some people will not stoop to to
<br>
prove a point, and their sexual preference has nothing to do with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Please provide referrences proving your contention that all (overt?) hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; crimes commited in the state of Vermont in the period in question were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; actually commited by gays.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Those were the only two of consequence, that I already mentioned, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will research and see if there were others. The remainder were mostly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all phone calls to judges, clerks, and legislators. Many found that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; majority of the hostile invective during this whole period was from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those supporting civil unions, making many rather hateful remarks about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those opposed to civil unions on principle but who were not anti-gay in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particular.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You ducked the question Michael.  Put up or withdraw this preposterous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim.
</em><br>
<p>No I didn't. I just don't have any links to provide you at the moment,
<br>
since we heah up in tha sticks h'ain't got ourn papers all
<br>
electronicized.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Most of the invective in the other direction has been, I have found,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anger that is a consequence of the individuals it is directed at being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; royal jerks no matter what their persuasion is. If thats a crime, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; call me a bigot. I hate assholes too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem to have a love of empty generalizations.  Can't you make your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points without them?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not generalizing about all supporters of civil unions (since I am
<br>
one). What I am saying is that there are individuals who are doing the
<br>
cause in general more harm than good by their misguided actions. Now, I
<br>
can understand someone who has been living under a cloud of real or
<br>
perceived persecution for a large chunk of their lives internalizing a
<br>
lot of the hate they perceive in others, and are consequently
<br>
emotionally hair triggered to assume anyone who is not overtly like them
<br>
to be thus against them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is funny, actually. Most of those same communities experience no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; murders, car thefts, robberies, or other major crimes, yet does the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; federal government claim they are also lying about that too? If so,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where are the bodies??? Insurance claims? These communities typically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have one or two part time policemen, and some go decades without any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sort of death under questionable circumstances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As hard as it may seem for some people to believe, there are, in fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; many communities of peaceful, broad minded, tolerant people in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; country who are pushing no agenda, and want nothing more than to be left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in peace. There will always be individuals who are bigoted, but guess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what? Its their RIGHT. So far as I know, thought is not yet a crime in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this country, and its not your right to claim to be violated just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because not everybody thinks you are super.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could really give a shit what someone thinks of me.  But when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deny me the same rights as others have because of their bigoted opinion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or attack me and mine then that is a different matter entirely.  Don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trivialize this.  Having people you know killed just for being different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (one publicly beat to death with baseball bats) tends to make you pissed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off as hell when someone claims that you're just upset because people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think you and &quot;your kind&quot; are super.
</em><br>
<p>Nobody is denying you the right to join in union with someone of the
<br>
opposite sex for purposes of raising children under beneficial taxation
<br>
and legal protections. Now, the civil unions law, which I support
<br>
(versus some of its other supporters, who hurt themselves more than they
<br>
help), does try to redefine this under a separate but equal sortof
<br>
definition, while at the same time extending this right to anyone,
<br>
regardless of sexual preference (which is mandatory under the equal
<br>
protection clause which you claim you are denied your rights under).
<br>
Where the law still fails, in my opinion, and which exposes its
<br>
hypocrisy, is that it does not also legalize bigamy or polygamy, which
<br>
it constitutionally has to to comply with first amendment rights of
<br>
freedom of association.
