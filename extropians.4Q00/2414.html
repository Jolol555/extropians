<em>&gt; Let's see... the Greens support equal redistribution of wealth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; samantha:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Say no more.  They are already an extremely nasty form of idiots with just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one plank. An equal distribution of wealth would at this point make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone on earth a pauper and bring all progress to an immediate halt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (assuming you could acheive it).  By what twisted notion of justice does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone get exactly and only as much as everyone else regardless of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relative talent, devotion, merit, ambition, ability to wisely and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producively use the resources and so on?  How would such an absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; egalitarianism of results really help at all?
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I worded that one wrong.  I'll quote this directly from their own
<br>
material-
<br>
<p>&quot;The Greens stand for a society in which wealth and power are distributed
<br>
broadly among all the people rather than concentrated in the hands of a
<br>
few.&quot;
<br>
<p>No, they do not believe in equal redistribution of wealth.  I hope this
<br>
corrects that notion.  I'd also argue that with the way our economic system
<br>
is set up, many people attain wealth and power through means that do not
<br>
require talent or devotion, do not have the requisite ability (George W.
<br>
Bush, anyone?), or attain power through means that are far less than
<br>
ethical, means that result in the opression of others and the destruction of
<br>
the environment.  Sure, I like the thought of &quot;enlightened capitalism&quot;- I
<br>
was raised by an ethical, socially aware businessman father- but it is
<br>
frequently more of an exception than a rule.  Am I in support of communism
<br>
or a government-controlled economy? No.  Do I think that the corporate
<br>
structure needs a definite overhaul?  Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Only those utterly unable to concretize an abstract idea could fall for
</em><br>
such
<br>
<em>&gt; madness for a minute.
</em><br>
<p>What?  Socialism or Objectivism? ;)
