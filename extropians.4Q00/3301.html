<p>Is it the physical substance of which you're comprised that you'd be 
<br>
adverse to leaving behind?
<br>
<p>Is it the lapse in time from when your consciousness was in one body, 
<br>
and then in another?

<p>It does sound, though, that uploading could be an option for you if 
<br>
the right &quot;upgrades&quot; were available.  Isn't uploading into another 
<br>
form really just restoring your backup to a new medium?
<br>
<p>I'm not trying to pin you down or anything.  Actually, this whole 
<br>
Extropian thing is fairly new to me, so I'm trying to decide how I 
<br>
feel (in a logical goal-oriented sense) about these issues.  Where 
<br>
possible, I'd like to avoid basing those feelings on sentimentality.
<br>
<p>I don't believe that I have a spirit in any metaphysical sense, so if 
<br>
the sum total of who I am can be described in terms of my neural 
<br>
chemistry, I'm wondering if it's any real loss for me to accept 
<br>
backup restoration as continuity of self - if that backup can 
<br>
completely restore my neural chemistry (or whatever emulates it).
<br>
<p>If I'm wrong about having a spirit, then that spirit will go off and 
<br>
do its little spirit thing apart from my new incarnation anyway - 
<br>
puhraise Jayzuz.  Who knows, it might even attach itself to the new 
<br>
entity that becomes me.  Ain't that a slap happy scenario?
<br>
<p>So, if you (as the new entity) can't tell the difference; and your 
<br>
loved ones can't really tell the difference; and there's no 
<br>
metaphysical difference - does it really matter?

<p>Aieee! stop stop stop.  I still intend to see this movie!
