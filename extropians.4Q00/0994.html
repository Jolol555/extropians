<p>The more I discover about Mitsuo Kawato's Dynamic Brain project, the more I want

to get involved with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seriously, I

</em><br>
<p>I can definitely foresee the risk for me (to the delight of many on this list),
<br>
but maybe not the direction. BTW, speaking of drop-outs-and-ins, I've heard
<br>
(People magazine) that Steve Wozniak <a href="http://www.woz.org/">http://www.woz.org/</a> spends much of his time
<br>
and some of his millions experimenting with parallel computing in his spacious
<br>
basement in Redwood City, California.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I attended the EU Advanced Computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neuroscience Course in Trieste for a month. Some interesting stuff,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially if you like me love neuroscience. Perhaps the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist talk was by Miguel Nicolelis, working on direct brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control of robot arms in rats and monkeys.

<p>So, if we don't see you around the Extro-water cooler, it could mean you're busy

I'll look for your name on the Lab roster.

<p>Have you read _Methods for Neural Ensemble Recordings_?

<p><em>&gt; I also gave a few lectures on AI, neural networks and the history and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future of computers to the participants in the Multimedia program at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local university. Hmm, *they* got a lecture on transhumanism - when do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *I* get one? :-)
</em><br>
<p>Well, you ain't gonna get one from me, since, as you might know, I favor Mind
<br>
Children, Artilects, Spiritual Machines, and Robo sapiens over transhumans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It might not carry that much weight to you or even the community here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but among many people it is a compelling reason to think that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something undesirable with singularity. A knee-jerk libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction would of course to blame egalitarianism, but I think there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are also deeper reasons. But it would be too complex to explain well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at this time of night; I think I'll save it for a more careful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis.
</em><br>
<p>I'll be waiting...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I definitely doesn't want to be the first upload but rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;part of the research team (a scary thought for all would-be-uploads :-)
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't scare me. How much will you charge for the ride?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In reality, people opt for a technology when the benefits seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outweigh the cost (as well as various other technology adoption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factors); there is a group of innovators and early adopters who will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try things long before the others and be the real guinea pigs. Often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people adopt technology long before it is flawless, even when it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous (airbags, airplanes, operating systems). As a Stanislaw Lem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; character remarked, we really ought to raise a monument to the honor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of all those who died while attempting to discover what was edible or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not - they helped us immensely. The same goes for the betatesters.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, ya gotta hand it to the first guys who drank cow's milk.
<br>
First Caveman: &quot;You see that critter over there with the bag hanging under it?&quot;
<br>
Second Caveman: &quot;Ug. You mean the one with the engorged udder and teats bigger
<br>
than Alley Oop's old lady's?&quot;
<br>
First Caveman: &quot;Yeah, I think maybe it has good time juice in it.&quot;
<br>
Second Caveman: &quot;Okay, I'll go over there and squeeze it, and whatever comes
<br>
out, I'm gonna drink it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Personally, I'm not looking for any benefits to outweigh the cost. I figure they
<br>
won't charge me anything to volunteer, and in fact the researchers might *pay*
<br>
me to act as their lab rat. Perhaps I've seen too much of this cruel world, and
<br>
it makes me want out, but if I become the first upload (like there's a big
<br>
chance of that happening), I'd try to get to the computers at Stanford before
<br>
they zap me back.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here is something to think about: how to make it profitable to be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; early adopter or beta tester? Society as a whole needs them, but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not seem to derive that much benefit themselves and I would expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that memetic evolution would make them relatively scarce. We might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to create institutions that help them to thrive and produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience.
</em><br>
<p>Great idea! If you ever find such an institution, please give them my number,
<br>
won't you?

<em>&gt; We're seeing transhumanist ideas discussed in wider and wider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fora, although usually without the label &quot;transhumanism&quot; or &quot;extropian&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Kurzweil's book and Jaron Lanier's article in Edge.org are good examples).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Superficial discussions of the early technologies and initial ethical, social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and political implications of transhumanism can be found increasingly in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popular press, from business magazines to publications like TIME and Newsweek.
</em><br>
<p>That's a fact, Greg. I've seen Max and Nancy on TV more than once. All ya gotta
<br>
do is be yourself as an authentic extrope, and the media will love you.
<br>
Futurists are the darlings of media, even when they (the media) mock futurism,
<br>
they do it in a good-natured rather than mean way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...it would be GREAT if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there was a single book out there that had &quot;high throw weight&quot; as Ralph
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Merkle says of the effect that Drexler's &quot;Nanosystems&quot; had on the field of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology.  We really do need such a book, created and promoted in such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a way that it can galvanize the high-credentialled academic world and serve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a focal point for rallying wider support for the movement.
</em><br>
<p>I've pondered why some people waste time on e-mail lists rather than
<br>
writing/publishing their views between book covers. Then again, perhaps that
<br>
explains why Max doesn't participate more on this list. Wonder what he'll call
<br>
his first book. Someone else on this list seems to pick members' brains for
<br>
material to include in his novels. Like Anders says, &quot;I guess this is why many
<br>
oldtimers are not around, they are out there doing stuff&quot; Yeah, like writing the
<br>
Great American Extropian Non-fiction Best Seller. But the list functions like
<br>
the proverbial water cooler in the hall -- a chat room with decorum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We also need activism, though.  As I repreatedly point out here, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opponents of augmentation and technological progress are well-funded and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a diverse and rich ideological foundation.  They are also politically adept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and active.  Unless we organize a clearly-defined &quot;pro-progress&quot; coalition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we risk losing the battle for public support, which WILL be important in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crucial next few decades.
</em><br>
<p>The strongest form of activism that could help speed and promote extropy would
<br>
IMO involve spectacular sucesses in the fields of nanotech, biotech, AI, ALife,
<br>
and the consilience/convergence of these domains in technological singularity.
<br>
We've no time for PR. We need breakthroughs more than activism, IMNSHO.
