<em>&gt; &gt;How do you know?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;If you want to resist philosophy, then stop thinking about that question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;right now, you'd need philosophical concepts to answer it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No I don't, just clear thinking ... no philosophical training needed!
</em><br>
<p>Actually, this is akin to saying you need a degree to do science.  You don't
<br>
need to be trained to do philosophy.  It might help, if the training is
<br>
good, but it might hinder if you are just taught bad methods and work from
<br>
flawed foundations.  However, this is no argument against philosophy or
<br>
philosophizing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Isn't logic a subset of philosophy? It was in the philosophy department
</em><br>
at
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;my college. I'm sure you know Russell was an academic philosopher.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe it was, but academic philosophers would like to think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every academic pursuit is a subset of philosophy! Russell was a CND
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campaigner, I suppose that makes him a politician as well ... and he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started out as a mathematician .... I am not sure labels are that helpful.
</em><br>
<p>Again, we come back to defining philosophy.  I've offered my working
<br>
defintion.  What's yours?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Philosophy suffers the same problem AI does. Once you solve the problem,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it's not considered philosophy anymore.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What solved problems do you have in mind here?
</em><br>
<p>I disagree with the claim that solved problems are no longer philosophy.  I
<br>
also disagree that philosophical problems are insoluble.  I think what does
<br>
happen, however, is that the areas where problems are solved become less
<br>
glamorous, but this is the same with any field.  A lot more mathematicians
<br>
today are busy working on nonlinear dynamics than are working on, say,
<br>
euclidean geometry.  Does this make euclidean geometry less a part of math?
<br>
<p>As for actual solved problems in philosophy, I tend to think the idea of God
<br>
has been refuted at every turn.  That's one issue down.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most academic research runs on a much tighter timescale ... are you sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the &quot;appropriate department&quot; or even the Institution itself will
</em><br>
still
<br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around to benefit from these breakthroughs from the Philosophy department
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after 1,000's of years?
</em><br>
<p>What about Mills' Methods [of Induction] or Popper's method of
<br>
falsification?  These have definitely proved helpful in science, especially
<br>
by helping focus attention on stuff that was previously implied in a lot of
<br>
research.  This is not to say a lot or most philosophy is garbage, but some
<br>
is useful.  Don't throw out the baby with the bathwater...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are correct in pointing out that philosophy is fertilizer!!!!! Utter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bullshit.
</em><br>
<p>Can you give examples?  There are bad philosophers and bad philosophies, in
<br>
the sense that they don't work.  But this is no different than there being
<br>
pseudoscience.  Pseudoscience does not make valid science a sham, but it
<br>
does mean we have to be on guard, that having a PhD or heading up an
<br>
institute does not make one right or honest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;The first debates about atoms were held among philosophers in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Ancient Greece. Pythagora (spelling?), who discovered the Pythagorean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;theorem and many other facts about numbers, had a cult of philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;students whose behavior was in some respects more bizarre then the
</em><br>
Heaven's
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Gate castration comet suicide cult.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pythagorean magicians might dispute your claiming of Pythagoras for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; academic philosophy .....
</em><br>
<p>This comes done to defining philosophy again.  Ancient Greece was the first
<br>
place where philosophy was separated from religion.  So one would expect a
<br>
lot of progress, but a lot of old doctrines sticking to the new way of
<br>
thinking.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
