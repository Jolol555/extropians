<em>&gt; I agree with you on this, Mr. Hughes.  Extremist rhetoric bothers me, even
</em><br>

<em>&gt; equating Germany in the 1930s or Russia in the 1950s with, say, Sweden in the

</em><br>
<p>The only difference between the two is that one enslaves you with guns and
<br>
concentration camps, secret police and propaganda, the other does it with
<br>
paperwork and propaganda, regulation and oh so arrogant bureaucrats who paint
<br>
you as a crazy person if you don't agree that what is best for everyone (as
<br>
determined by the government, of course) is best for you. The result is the
<br>
same. 
<br>
<p>Of course, liberals like Hughes have always maintained that Sweden is the most
<br>
advanced nation on earth... of course the fact that the swedes are aryan
<br>
socialists in no way is meant to imply that liberals are bigots (like Nazis) in
<br>
their hearts but are too polite to admit it. This secret bigotry is why they so
<br>
adamantly deny that the Nazis were in fact socialists (as anyone who has studied
<br>
the nazi plans for &quot;Germania&quot; after the war, or read Mein Kampf can attest)
