<p><em>&gt; Damien, My major problem with this attitude on the part of the Swedes is that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know hardly anything that is completely safe.  Do you suppose that as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they start to notice the harmful aspects of common household and industrial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substances they will begin outlawing those substances retroactively?  Will 
</em><br>
<p>Note they're not banning _everything_.  They're saying substances which are
<br>
persistent and bioaccumulative are banned unless they can be shown to not be
<br>
toxic.  Does that really seem like a bad idea?
<br>
<p>&quot;I have this great new chemical, it'll make production much cheaper.  
<br>
&quot;It never degrades and will get collected up the food chain.  What's it do to
<br>
the things it accumulates in?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Let's try it and see!&quot;
<br>
<p>People worry about gray goo, but think checking of persistent chemicals or
<br>
released GM organisms is evil government interference?
<br>
<p>The article didn't discuss the Swedish rules in detail, but I could imagine
<br>
allowing a company to use dangerous chemicals if it showed that it wasn't
<br>
letting them be released into the environment.  Closed loop manufacturing, or
<br>
detoxifying the waste.
<br>
<p>I don't like wondering how much mercury is in my seafood.  I think this is a
<br>
good thing.
<br>
<p>As for household substances, we've already moved a lot of the way to phosphate
<br>
free detergents.  Maybe we should think again about dumping chlorine compounds
<br>
and excess nitrogen into our water as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; they get all the way back to caveman days do you suppose?  Can you imagine a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caveman chipping an arrowhead while wearing safety goggles to prevent stone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chips from blinding him?
</em><br>
<p>What's the point of this analogy?  What's it an analogy to?
<br>
<p>And I could imagine someone with good motor control closing his eyes at the
<br>
moment of striking.  Not having struck flint I can't weigh the risks of losing
<br>
an eye vs. mashing a thumb.
