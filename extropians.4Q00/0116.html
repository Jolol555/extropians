Dan Fabulich astutely pointed out,
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Yes, but suppose that in order to get a linear increase in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, you had to solve a problem requiring an exponential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of computations.  Sure, for each increase in intelligence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'd start churning through the next exponent faster, but there'd be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so much more thinking you'd have to do to get another increase that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual progress would get slower and slower.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I see what you mean. (This list is not unmindful of previous posts stating
<br>
Dan's point, I'd guess. No doubt the old thread restlessly abides in the
<br>
archives.) So we're faced with this threshold of intelligence amplification that
<br>
thwarts efforts to transcend present levels of intellectual acumen. Bother. Now,
<br>
what I'd suggest is that rather than crucifying or expelling or banning or
<br>
excommunicating or pilloring the hyper-intelligent (as we've been wont to do
<br>
with such heretics as Buddha, Bodhidharma, Galileo, and Darwin), we should
<br>
instead try to learn from them. A radical idea, I know... but maybe its time has
<br>
come.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, nobody has any idea how much computation is required to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase one's own intelligence, since, at present, what with our wet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains and all, even if we knew what to do to our brains, we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the fine-grained tools to implement our plans.
</em><br>
<p>Right, and furthermore, we don't know how to protect super-high IQ brains from
<br>
Fundamentalist wackos who want to send us all to hell (after beheading us,
<br>
putting us before firing squads, or simply ignoring us while building bigger
<br>
cathedrals, mosques, and temples). In the long run, creating superintelligence
<br>
may be the easy part. Protecting AI from fascistic control freaks who want to
<br>
make humanity into a zoo/museum of political correctitude governed by a
<br>
socialist hive mentality may be the difficult part.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For all we know, it'll turn out that exponential increases in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence requires solving a problem requiring a linearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing number of steps, and just as soon as we get the tools to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start messing around, our intelligence will go through the roof.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (This is the Singularity picture.)  Frankly, we're basically in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dark here.
</em><br>
<p>A single candle can dispel infinite darkness.
