&nbsp;------------------ 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The site is very much in its infancy at present (low-tech and
</em><br>
not much content yet), but I felt it was necessary to start spreading
<br>
extropian memes in Italian (given the total lack of extropian/tranhumanist
<br>
resources in that language). The idea is to start from the basics,
<br>
by making available in Italian some of the introductory documents
<br>
available on the web on the subjects of extropy, transhumanism,
<br>
nanotechnology, cryonics, the singularity, etc.&lt;
<br>
<p>Allora.  This is a bit startling to read.  Although I applaud
<br>
your efforts and I think it is wonderful that you have taken
<br>
on the task of spreading memes alla Italy, prego - do it with
<br>
precision and a dash of panache.
<br>
<p>Extropians and Extropic Art were recently featured in a leading
<br>
Italian magazine.  Perhaps you missed this?  I posted it to this
<br>
list just a few weeks ago, I believe.  This is important and
<br>
you should reference this article because it was a cover story
<br>
with excellent journalism.  I wouldn't be surprised if this story
<br>
gets picked up by other Italian periodicals.
<br>
<p>Also, it seems strange to me that you emphasize the WTA FAQ which
<br>
has some flaws and inconsistencies which I don't believe have
<br>
been corrected yet.  Someone should have explained this to you.
<br>
&nbsp;Also, I checked out your links and no where do you mention any
<br>
of our Web sites that pertain the Arts and Culture, the Transhumanist
<br>
Statement (re culture) or the Extropic Art Manifesto.  Oh my,
<br>
and you want to appeal to Italians?  
<br>
<p>In that Italy is known for its arts and culture, it would seem
<br>
to me that one way to spread extropic memes would be to encourage
<br>
creative thinking in the cultural arena.  This is not to discount
<br>
or place less emphasis on technology and science, but when too
<br>
much emphasis is place on the latter an imbalance occurs that
<br>
is neither helpful to our culture nor our goals.
<br>
<p>If you want to get the history of transhuman ideas accurately,
<br>
and I trust you do, then please refer to my book which is easy
<br>
to read and translate.  If you need assistance, please write
<br>
to me privately.
<br>
<p>My suggestion to you clearly reference our culture from an inclusive
<br>
perspective and transhuman history (which I can provide) or which
<br>
ExI is also working on.
<br>
<p>Thank you,
<br>
<p>Natasha Vita-More
