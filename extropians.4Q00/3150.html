Whoa up there, friend Eliezer. 
<br>
<p>I am speaking specifically of genetic enhancement, not uploading,
<br>
borgification, &amp;c.
<br>
<p>As long as the human race's eggs are literally in the DNA basket, I
<br>
think we ought to have some way of retaining the complexity that has
<br>
emerged in the sheaf of genome variations.
<br>
<p>I was thinking of a way to fairly select across a broad base, including
<br>
people who might be disappointed if they didn't get to tweak their DNA.
<br>
<p>I am not really big on the draft, in any form. But this particular idea,
<br>
which I will not defend further, is as a hedge against the human race's
<br>
virtual total genocide due to an unforeseen vulnerability. If enough
<br>
volunteers are found, all the better.
