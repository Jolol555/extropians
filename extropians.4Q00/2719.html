<em>&gt; On the Templeton list where I also lurk, people are, of course, less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dedicated to rationalism and the Ayn Rand view as the paramount ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value. Rationalism is an superb guidepost, as long as it doesn't become a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'hitching-post' to quote an associate of mine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So where does that leave people like me (not that anyone need care!)?  To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paraphrase the great philosopher on the American Beer coomercial for Miller
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beer; &quot;Where is the Love, man?&quot; To which the antagonist replied, &quot;You're not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting my beer Bob&quot;. My concern here is not love, but a less agreeable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attribute to desire..pity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Someone like the icon of this group, Ayn Rand would no doubt see pity in as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grave weakness and a mental dysfunction, as well as a character flaw of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Richtorian scale.
</em><br>
<p><p>WRONG.  She saw pity as a sad and not very desirable emotion that it
<br>
would be better not to have cause to feel.  But she did not see it as
<br>
weakness or dysfunction or character flaw.   It is not desirable to
<br>
experience pity.  It is more desriable to be able to do something
<br>
positive to improve that which has illicited pity.  Pity by itself, or
<br>
any particular emotion, is not a good guide to decision and action in
<br>
objectivist thought.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe she would have been correct. However, I look at the human condition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature red in tooth and claw, and such as a fact of life. But like disease
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and death, a fact which needs to be mitigated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Then change the nature of that reality by creating societies of
<br>
abundance.  Let any pity simply serve as a goad to move on to something
<br>
not so pitiful.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now if mysticism can do the job, excellent! If pure technological prowess can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve this, mondo-bondo! If someone comes up with philosophy or drugs or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new branch of science that can push back the pain, let me join in.
</em><br>
<p><p>Someone once said something like &quot;Pain is the whip of God&quot; - meaning
<br>
that pain is the impetus to find something better, to movement.  We have
<br>
tried many things and helped in some ways and harmed in others.  So we
<br>
adjust and do something slightly different.  I don't believe that any
<br>
one thing whether science or mysticism or something else will solve
<br>
all.  We need all the science we can get welded with a really compelling
<br>
vision of where we wish to go (rather than souped up replays of where
<br>
we've been) and deep dedication to the Work.  For it is a Work in the
<br>
most time-honored sense, a work of rebuilding self and world and of
<br>
transcending all limitation possible of being transcended.  Science by
<br>
itself will not give you and sustain the sense of mission that is needed
<br>
or the sacred dream meme that will join enough people together to make a
<br>
difference.
