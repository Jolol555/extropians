<p><em>&gt; &gt;Why do I live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;such a self-destructive life that I can't seem to find a way to escape?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Mainly because I'm a powerless, corporate pawn.  I don't want the life that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I have- but I know no way out, at least none that looks very appealing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;minute I step out into the cold Minnesota air.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Give some specifics, this is to vague for me to suggest any remedy for you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I'll reiterate that I am subject to the same advertising messages that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are, but am in no way &quot;enslaved to materialism&quot;. Everything I purchase 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is useful to me and purchased voluntarily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Some specifics from this side:  
<br>
<p>I have attained a fairly reasonable level in my career (sysadmin/CM) and I'm
<br>
fairly well-paid.  However, the work does very little for me other than 
<br>
bringing in money to pay for the things that I need, but can't provide for 
<br>
myself without the media for exchange.  
<br>
<p>I've got some money in savings, and I've been working on investing it slowly
<br>
to try and get a good nestegg going.  However, it seems my savings are growing
<br>
slower than the cost of living.
<br>
<p>I gre up rural - I know how to take care of things like animals and plants, and
<br>
I wouldnt' mind returning to that sort of a life partially - not a Luddite
<br>
hermit like the Unabomber, but a techno-hermit, with satellite uplink, 
<br>
computers, generating my own power, taking care of most of my needs without
<br>
reliance on the outside.  
<br>
<p>But in the end it comes down to the tyrany of money.  There is no place I 
<br>
can live without either the fear of imminent confiscation by the latest 
<br>
banana republic despot in the name of &quot;land reform&quot;, or the need to have some
<br>
sort of steady income to pay the various property taxes.  
<br>
<p>So here is the conundrum.  The land that is inexpensive enough to afford is
<br>
too far from the places I am capable of finding work (did I mention I'm a
<br>
widely-read, hopefully well-spoken high school grad?  No college diploma
<br>
here, unfortunately - and that cuts my options down even more), and the land
<br>
close enough to be able to work reasonably is very expensive now, especially 
<br>
for what would be needed for this sort of subsistence, and at the same time 
<br>
it's also prone to the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; property tax progression - one 
<br>
farmer sells out to a developer for 50 units, and they agree to add $5000
<br>
per acre in property taxes for new schools - after all, they're only paying
<br>
$500-$1250 at best for their share, but the farmer next door just got tagged 
<br>
for $500,000 more per year, and is forced to sell to a developer, and it
<br>
goes on and on.
<br>
<p>And my work does very little toward allowing me to pursue the things I hold
<br>
most dear - because I have to spend so much o my time dealing with traffic, 
<br>
and working most of my waking hours to pay for the house I don't really want
<br>
and the gas I would like to not have to use to get to and from a job that
<br>
doesn't really line up with my personal interests.  But it's the trap of the 
<br>
moneyed system.
<br>
<p>Yes, I understand a true libertarian society would have a different set of 
<br>
problems, and I could find a place where I wouldn't have to pay property
<br>
taxes - but if you can show me a true libertarian nation I could move to...
<br>
<p>There.  Specific enough?
<br>
<p>-Corey
