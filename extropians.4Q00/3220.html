</em><br>
<p>Not sure if black holes and white dwarves would be the best ways to do
<br>
this.  Perhaps reshaping the system's asteroids and unwanted
<br>
planets/moons into an electromagnet/Dyson Toroid, with the bit facing
<br>
the planet at the center exposed?  The Dyson near-shell would
<br>
hopefully provide at least enough power to sustain the electromagnet;
<br>
indeed, this would probably prove to be quite similar to a modern
<br>
tokamak reactor (which can contain plasma without 100% of the toroid's
<br>
surface actually doing anything).
<br>
<p>Now, if that were done, every point on the planet would see a permanent
<br>
arc of light in the sky where the sun is - which would make seeing in
<br>
certain directions impossible without shades.  (Then again, there would
<br>
never be a &quot;night&quot; there, so most likely everyone walking outside on the
<br>
surface would have to wear shades, at least if the indoor areas where
<br>
people can shut off the lights to get some sleep were kept near
<br>
Earth-normal luminescence, and assuming normal human beings as
<br>
colonists.)
