<p>Gene research scientists close to human hibernation breakthrough
<br>
<p>By Jonathan Thompson
<br>
<p>3 December 2000
<br>
<p>If you find winter too much of a struggle, hang on a while. Human
<br>
hibernation is on the way. The concept of people being able to drop
<br>
out of the year's gloomiest season is no longer the stuff of
<br>
science-fiction fantasy. In America, the US Army is funding research
<br>
into the subject, and scientists from Minnesota to Moscow are
<br>
looking at its practicality.
<br>
<p>On Friday, a professor at the University of Marburg, Germany,
<br>
specialising in animal physiology, reported a key breakthrough.
<br>
&quot;There is no real reason to say that humans are so different from
<br>
other mammals that they are unable to enter hibernation,&quot; Gerhard
<br>
Heldmaier said last night.
<br>
<p>Professor Heldmaier is chairman of the International Hibernation
<br>
Society and his discovery was of two genes which are believed to
<br>
trigger hibernation. The finding of the genes, which are involved
<br>
in controlling, or &quot;switching&quot; enzymes to equip the body for
<br>
hibernation by allowing it to burn fat rather than carbohydrates,
<br>
is the latest in a series of discoveries about human hibernation.
<br>
&quot;For many years we have been fiddling around, trying to find a
<br>
handle or a switch to turn on this metabolism,&quot; he said.  &quot;Now,
<br>
for the first time, we have genes involved in this control. &quot;
<br>
<p>The first big breakthrough in human hibernation came just under 12
<br>
months ago. Matthew T Andrews, a biochemist at the University of
<br>
Minnesota, began identifying the first of these &quot;switching&quot; genes,
<br>
named PL and PDK-4. Last night, speaking from his laboratory in
<br>
Minnesota, Professsor Andrews, said: &quot;In the hibernation genes we
<br>
have discovered, there are similar genetic sequences with those of
<br>
humans. It is decades away, but ... short-term stasis would be
<br>
potentially possible after a lot more investigation on the
<br>
molecular-biological level.&quot;
<br>
<p>Although the research suggests the possibility of our going under
<br>
the duvet in November and not emerging until spring, the most likely
<br>
application of the work would be space travel and medicine. The
<br>
two professors' discoveries have already led to huge interest
<br>
worldwide. The US Army, which has funded Professor Andrews' research,
<br>
is reportedly keen to investigate the potential of hibernation as
<br>
a means of moving wounded soldiers in a safe &quot;stasis state&quot; from
<br>
battlefield to surgery. Nasa, interested in human hibernation for
<br>
long-distance space travel, has sponsoredresearch on the subject
<br>
at leading US universities.
<br>
<p>Space travel hibernation, said Professor Andrews, is still &quot;pure
<br>
science fiction&quot;. But he added: &quot;More realistically, one of the
<br>
first main benefits of this process could be organ preservation.
<br>
If you could put organs into long-term stasis, as does a hibernator,
<br>
you could preserve them for months. At the moment, body organs will
<br>
only keep for about three or four days. Hibernation could eventually
<br>
save lives.&quot;
<br>
<p>At the International Hibernation Society's eleventh symposium in
<br>
August, held in the Austrian village of Jungholz, Kathrine Dausmann,
<br>
one of Professor Heldmaier's protgs, presented evidence of the
<br>
first-known hibernating primate, a Madagascan lemur. &quot;The fact that
<br>
primates, our closest relatives, can hibernate, again revived the
<br>
speculation about the possibility of this process in humans,&quot; said
<br>
Professor Heldmaier. &quot;This has the potential to be very useful for
<br>
human medicine. There are strange things you can achieve by the
<br>
state of your mind. We just have to discover more about the switch
<br>
which allows us to turn this hibernation on or off.&quot;
