<em>&gt; &gt; BULLSHIT.  That statement reeks of unsupported claim.  And I know my

<em>&gt; I can mail you the newspaper clippings of the confessions. You have

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't have blinders on.  I know some people will go too far.  Like
<br>
claiming that all hate crimes in an entire state are the work of gays
<br>
trying to whip up enthusiasm for what they want.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not generalizing about all supporters of civil unions (since I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one). What I am saying is that there are individuals who are doing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause in general more harm than good by their misguided actions. Now, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can understand someone who has been living under a cloud of real or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceived persecution for a large chunk of their lives internalizing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of the hate they perceive in others, and are consequently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotionally hair triggered to assume anyone who is not overtly like them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be thus against them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I  agree that some do the cause harm by wrong-headed methods.  But I
<br>
have a big problem with over-generalizing on the basis of that.  I don't
<br>
think it is being hair-triggered to have one of the few state intiatives
<br>
to give us some measure of equality before the law be something one is
<br>
sensitive to others putting down.  I am glad to hear you are actually a
<br>
supporter.  But I don't think you are in a position to label others as
<br>
suffering from internalized homophobia just because they distrust
<br>
statements of faint support after long experience of such support
<br>
melting away at critical moments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I could really give a shit what someone thinks of me.  But when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deny me the same rights as others have because of their bigoted opinion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or attack me and mine then that is a different matter entirely.  Don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trivialize this.  Having people you know killed just for being different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (one publicly beat to death with baseball bats) tends to make you pissed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; off as hell when someone claims that you're just upset because people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't think you and &quot;your kind&quot; are super.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nobody is denying you the right to join in union with someone of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite sex for purposes of raising children under beneficial taxation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and legal protections. Now, the civil unions law, which I support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (versus some of its other supporters, who hurt themselves more than they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help), does try to redefine this under a separate but equal sortof
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition, while at the same time extending this right to anyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of sexual preference (which is mandatory under the equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protection clause which you claim you are denied your rights under).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where the law still fails, in my opinion, and which exposes its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypocrisy, is that it does not also legalize bigamy or polygamy, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it constitutionally has to to comply with first amendment rights of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom of association.
</em><br>
<p>It is not joining with someone of the opposite sex that is the problem 
<br>
and even that was never only about procreation.  I am fundamentally
<br>
lesbian in my predilections so I don't understand why it helps to remind
<br>
me that I can join with someone of the opposite sex. (!?) Couples (of
<br>
all kinds) need certain types of legal instruments to function well as a
<br>
couple, especially when it comes to joint property, survival benefits
<br>
and taxes, raising children and so on.  It is primarily the religionists
<br>
who say that only marriage between a man and a woman should be so
<br>
construed and respected.
