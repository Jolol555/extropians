You guys were soooooooo lucky: I always was interested in computers, but
<br>
my Dad wouldn't even let me touch his computer. My Mom finally could
<br>
afford a computer for me when I was 17, it was a Commodore Amiga 500. In
<br>
1995, I finally got a Pentium-I-60Mhz box, and I was almost 25 years
<br>
old. Living in Germany, my Mom and I couldn't afford internet access
<br>
until the end of 1998.
<br>
So, I want to take this opportunity to thank my husband Brian Atkins for
<br>
uplifting me into a world I dreamed of for such a long time: A private
<br>
network, consisting of 9 computers. He helped me building an
<br>
AMD-Athlon-700Mhz box, I got an Apple G4 cube (just for the looks of
<br>
course :-) and an OpenBSD server.
