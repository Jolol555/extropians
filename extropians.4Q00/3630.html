Hello Robin,
<br>
<p>I suppose you're asking about my mailing list due to David Brin. 
<br>
Just some background-
<br>
<p>I started Freematt's Alerts 10 years ago and opened it to the public 
<br>
in 1995.  I have over 10,000 subscribers all over the world. 
<br>
E-groups maintains an archive located at 
<br>
<a href="http://www.egroups.com/list/fa/">http://www.egroups.com/list/fa/</a> .  Although, I run the list off one 
<br>
of my machines.
<br>
<p>I'm interested in many of the same things you are-
<br>
<p>I first read Brin's &quot;Confessions Of A Cheerful Libertarian&quot; in 
<br>
Prometheus, the newsletter of the Libertarian Futurist Society and 
<br>
asked for Brin's permission to run it in my list.  Brin granted me 
<br>
permission and I posted it on 12-01-2000.  I placed an afterword 
<br>
critical of a couple of points that enraged Brin.  Last week I 
<br>
exchanged several emails with him that has convinced me he doesn't 
<br>
handle criticism well.
<br>
<p>Brin responded to my afterword by calling me clueless, a liar and 
<br>
wimp etc. and demanded that I post his diatribe to my list.  I told 
<br>
Brin I'd be happy to post a rewrite if he removed the personal 
<br>
invectives.  I send new subscribers these guidelines:
<br>
<p>&quot;Guidelines for submissions: Send only items that are on topic. The writing
<br>
must be articulate and factual.  I will not edit the content, but I may add
<br>
a descriptive header if necessary. If it is an opinion, it must be well
<br>
thought out and contain no personal invectives.  Send anything you feel is
<br>
related to individual freedom, either directly or indirectly (you be the
<br>
judge). Send copyrighted material only if you have permission from the
<br>
copyright holder to do so. (I only send the best submissions to keep the
<br>
volume down and the quality up)&quot;
<br>
<p>Brin then demanded that I provide him if the names and addresses of 
<br>
my subscribers so he could verify what I was sending them.  I told 
<br>
him that wasn't happening so now he has threatened to find them by 
<br>
other means.  Freematt's Alerts is a private list open to the public, 
<br>
and it will stay private.
<br>
<p>I'm in the process of collecting some useful commentary on Brin that 
<br>
I intend to post to my list.  Hal Finney and Michael Lorrey have 
<br>
given me permission to use their commentary on Brin and I've received 
<br>
some other illuminating commentary from several others.
<br>
<p>Regards,  Matt-
