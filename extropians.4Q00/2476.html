<em>&gt;Weight lifting is the answer, along with getting sufficient

</em><br>
<p>The consensus of the experts, according to my reading over the last 20 
<br>
years or so, is that 8-10 reps per set maximizes muscle growth. 4-6 reps 
<br>
will maximize strength, while 15 or more reps (with short rest breaks) will 
<br>
improve aerobic conditioning and muscle tone with less muscle growth. Some 
<br>
simple steps to maximize muscle gain:
<br>
<p>-- 8-10 reps per set.
<br>
<p>-- Take a good break between sets (in heavy training mode I take a 
<br>
two-minute break) so that you can use heavy weights on every set.
<br>
<p>-- Use the heaviest weight you can possibly manage for 8-10 reps.
<br>
<p>-- To protect your body, especially when lifting heavy weights, use strict 
<br>
form. (I see a lot of sloppy execution at the gym.)
<br>
<p>-- Don't overtrain. That means working each muscle group as hard as 
<br>
possible (after a month or two of building up), then letting it rest for 
<br>
*at least* 3 or 4 days, preferably a week. Big muscle groups (like quads) 
<br>
take longer to recover than smaller ones (like biceps).
<br>
<p>-- Cut down on carbs that have no real nutrition and replace with lean 
<br>
protein sources, especially fish.
<br>
<p>-- An hour or so before working out, drink a protein shake containing whey 
<br>
protein, creatine (which will immediately produce a weight gain due to 
<br>
water retention but will help you push your muscles harder), and glutamine.
<br>
<p>-- Get plenty of sleep (let that growth hormone be released).
<br>
<p>That should cover most of the important basics. For a good reference on a 
<br>
wide range of exercises from which to choose, buy Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
<br>
Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding.
<br>
<p>This program works for me. (I'm also doing a fair amount of aerobic 
<br>
exercise, but that will not add to your muscle growth and too much may 
<br>
actually reduce it.) At 36, I'm stronger than I've ever been, weighing 193 
<br>
lbs and (according to my Kronos Clinc tests) with a bodyfat that is well 
<br>
below average for a 20 year old. A similar program is also working well for 
<br>
Natasha, whose physique blows away practically all women half her age 
<br>
whatever that might be ;-) .
<br>
<p>Boundless expansion!
