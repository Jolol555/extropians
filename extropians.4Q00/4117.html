<p>This abstract posits that the cosmological constant is not zero or that the
<br>
Universe is not the sole result of our &quot;local&quot; big bang.  It is something like
<br>
that, or something else, these astronomists tell us more about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;We have shown that it is impossible to collect more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a finite amount of any quantity that scales as the (scale-factor)^3 .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, the entropy density of the universe scales in this fashion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus, independent of issues of whether there is infinite information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in an infinite universe, it is impossible to collect more than a finite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount. Effectively even an infinite universe allows only a finite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational system. The picture we have painted here is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimistic. If, as the current evidence suggests, we live in a cosmological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constant dominated universe, the boundaries of empirical knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will continue to decrease with time. The universe will become noticeably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less observable on a time-scale which is fathomable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moreover, in such a universe, the days - either literal or metaphorical -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are numbered for every civilization. More generally, perhaps surprisingly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we find that eternal sentient material life is implausible in any universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The eternal expansion which Dyson found so appealing is a chimera.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it possible to collect the full amount of information? I hope so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can get deep informations, at least mathematically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -scerir
</em><br>
<p>The full amount of information is collected, it is the state of the Universe.
<br>
Our technology can sample the tendency and state of matter at various points.
<br>
To use the entire information of the Universe it would be necessary to put the
<br>
Universe into the computer.
<br>
<p>The Universe of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, a finite state machine, has 9 spaces and
<br>
2 kinds of markers.  Chess has one significantly larger, or possibly infinite.
<br>
<p>Basically, what the paper seems to be saying is that the Universe is infinitely
<br>
large.  This is perhaps plainly naive.
<br>
<p>Later in the piece (p. 21), the authors allude that some technology allowing
<br>
the contravention of strong gravity would allow alternate space-time
<br>
construction events, or remove the physical laws preventing them from
<br>
occurring.
<br>
<p>Thank you!  Happy Holidays.
<br>
