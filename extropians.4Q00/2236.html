Did anyone else check out tonights airing of the Sci Trek show on the
<br>
Discovery channel tonight? They had a timeline from the coining of the word
<br>
robot (by Copic (sp?) in 1920 who wrote the first sci-fi play RUR) from the
<br>
word Robta-meaning forced labor. There were some clips of Asimov and his
<br>
books. They then continued with how we are using robots today, from policed
<br>
situations, to robowars, to military aspects, and even included Kevin
<br>
Warwick's temporary insertion of a microchip in his arm. (he was on the
<br>
show) Eventually, they tapered off with nanotechnology, and nanobots. They
<br>
had some pretty cool graphics for this segment, and showed a picture of
<br>
Drexler. Ray Kurzweil (who wrote, The Age of Spiritual Machines and who I
<br>
just saw speak at the Foresight Conference in Bethesda a few days back) and
<br>
Bill Spence (Publisher: Nanomagazine) were both interviewed for the show. Of
<br>
course both the utopian and doomsday scenerios of such an advanced
<br>
technology were discussed. It just barely skimmed the surface, but it's
<br>
always nice to see nano in the media. Apparently you can order the tape,
<br>
which I will have to figure out, since I mistakenly recorded a &quot;Pax&quot; show,
<br>
and needless to say, since erased.
