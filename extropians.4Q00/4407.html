Subject: Re: Sentience
<br>
<p>S&gt; Do you agree with McGinn that the mind-body problem is insoluble?
<br>
S&gt; If so, then you can pack up and go away. If you think that it can be
<br>
S&gt; solved, then you must also allow that an evolutionary account is
<br>
S&gt; needed. I accuse academic philosophers of &quot;THE ATHENA FALLACY (TM)&quot;
<br>
S&gt; ... that they deal with mind as if it sprung fully formed as &quot;human&quot;
<br>
S&gt; from the split head of Zeus ... and ignore the intermediate stages
<br>
S&gt; and natural processes that led to the current state of things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Don't be silly.  I commit no Athena fallacy: I have no account
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WHATSOEVER about how mind comes about, say nothing of one like you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;describe.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly, the Athena Fallacy IS that you have no account of how the
<br>
mind came about. The only human-been philosophical resource is
<br>
the method introspection ... which is an inadequate tool.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Phantom limbs aren't *real*.  They're a handy term to explain real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phenomena, but they don't actually exist.  It's like when I say things
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like &quot;Insects give me the creeps.&quot;  I don't posit that there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;REALLY &quot;creeps&quot; which insects give me.  I just mean that they make me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nervous.  Similarly with phantom limbs: there's no *actual* limb
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there, phantom or otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>I think the term &quot;creeps&quot; is adjectival in that it puns creepiness/ scare
<br>
with creeping sensation of shoulder muscles, physiological reaction
<br>
to revulsion &amp;c. So the originator of the phrase might indeed have
<br>
meant real &quot;creeps.&quot; You would certainly know a phantom arm if you had one.
<br>
<p>If you are making the linguistic point that it makes no difference talking
<br>
about &quot;phantom limbs&quot; or &quot;sensations experienced as if there is a
<br>
phantom limb, &quot; the OK, but the *feel* of the phantom limb is real.
<br>
I have pointed out that I don't care if you phrase your description of
<br>
consciousness as &quot; a phantom median eye&quot; or as &quot;the experience as
<br>
if a median eye was present&quot; ...... but the vernacular does not impact
<br>
on the phenomena, your whole posting is an attempt to confuse the
<br>
issue ... clarification requires elimination of &quot;epiphenomenalism&quot;
<br>
gobbledegook and all the other philosophical pseudo-language.
<br>
<p>SO&gt; I doubt a computer could &quot;imagine&quot; anything at all .......
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That is why you fail.
</em><br>
<p>In the future, we might be able to create computers that replicate
<br>
the evolutionary processes that bring about I-1 type consciousness,
<br>
and I agree that in principle these could be conscious. But such
<br>
silicon or metallic &quot;consciousness&quot; would be of a different quality
<br>
to the flesh-and-blood consciousness of being an organism! The
<br>
computer could have &quot;imagination-like&quot; behaviour, but this needs to
<br>
be combined with an awareness of itself as an entity having this
<br>
imagination, concurrently. I doubt it could happen, but don't rule it out.
<br>
<p>SO&gt; Only biological organisms can act independently from purely
<br>
SO&gt; chemical stimuli ...so we are talking about a very small subset of
<br>
SO&gt; &quot;atomic structures&quot; ... even more specifically, those animals with
<br>
SO&gt; I-1 brains.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Brains *cannot* act independently of chemical stimuli.
</em><br>
<p>How is a hypnotic suggestion or verbal cue a &quot;chemical stimuli?&quot;
<br>
The brain of one person will react in response to suggestions
<br>
given by another person (or TV &amp;co). Change of state, both physical
<br>
and conscious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;They are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;purely physical objects, with no more independence from the world than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rocks have.  Biological organisms are completely physically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;determined.
</em><br>
<p>If we were, then we could not experience internal light with no
<br>
outside reference or causal source. I am rather insulted that
<br>
you compare me (and everybody else) with lumps of rock.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How do you &quot;generate&quot; a non-existent entity?
</em><br>
<p>But psychological entities do exist ....
<br>
I take note that you have deleted my points about holes, which
<br>
your schema fails to cope with, so I repeat:
<br>
<p>A hole has a &quot;shape&quot; and &quot;size&quot; given in terms of its
<br>
substrate ... for instance a keyhole, or hole in the
<br>
road has measurable dimensions and we talk about holes
<br>
meaningfully .... even though they do not comprise of any matter.
<br>
Phantom limbs, and the phantom median eye, are functional gaps
<br>
as much as physical holes (although they do have physical correlates,
<br>
egg. the space where the physical arm was).
<br>
<p>Another functional gap might be a missing piece of computer data.
<br>
<p>How do you deal with holes (distinct from GAPS, which depend on
<br>
the fact that there was ONCE something present but no longer, whereas
<br>
a hole might be integral)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Brains are like Turing machines in that they are composed entirely of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simple physical parts that do simple physical things.  These physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parts move deterministically in lock-step.  (Though, to qualify this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;view, I'm a fan of many-worlds.)
</em><br>
<p>What parts of the brain &quot;move?&quot; ... the dualist problem has been described
<br>
precisely that the pineal gland (or any brain part) cannot be &quot;moved&quot; as,
<br>
say, a hand can be moved. Also, the point with parallel computing is that
<br>
things happen in PARALLEL, not in serial lockstep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Moreover, the physical world is causally closed.  Nothing non-physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interacts with the brain.
</em><br>
<p>See the verbal cue example above. Yes, nothing non-physical interacts with
<br>
the PHYSICAL bits of the brain, but thoughts (dreams, and other non-physical
<br>
stuff)
<br>
can interact with the NON-physical gap in the brain. Consciousness is the
<br>
infinite-state feedback loop between the brain and the environment made
<br>
possible
<br>
because the brain expects to receive data from a peripheral sensor that has
<br>
gone
<br>
missing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How do you &quot;generate&quot; a non-existent entity?
</em><br>
<p>By &quot;generate&quot; a phantom eye, I don't imply any active processes, it is
<br>
more like coins rolling down a ramp and falling into the correctly sized
<br>
holes, giving
<br>
the appearance of intelligently sorting coins into piles. The pathways to
<br>
and from
<br>
the old median eye (which predate even the visual cortex) expect  that data
<br>
travelling
<br>
along them is from the outside world, whereas in E-1 animals it is not! That
<br>
is why
<br>
I think consciousness is a trick of nature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Your tests establish a physical causal link
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between the real pineal eye and a lack of intelligent behaviour.  As
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the eye goes away, assuming you're right about this, intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behaviour begins to flourish.
</em><br>
<p>I find it hard to agree with your Epiphenomenalist assumption that
<br>
everything
<br>
that has happened in the universe to date would have happened in exactly the
<br>
same way if no animal had ever been even remotely aware of anything, and
<br>
that we are robots following out a behavioural script. This is not my
<br>
experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No.  We will find structural behavioral analogs, but we will never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;figure out why we see anything at all.  We'll be able to figure out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*when* we see something, but not how.
</em><br>
<p>So you seem to agree with McGinn ... a very defeatist stance, and very
<br>
unextropian! You haven't managed to answer my point against this
<br>
that, and I repeat since you avoid answering here:
<br>
<p>S&gt; Perhaps I should develop new and irresistible hypnotic applications
<br>
S&gt; from MVT and enforce belief in it ... would this satisfy you?
<br>
<p>This example was deliberately crafted because it underlines the
<br>
pre-eminence of consciousness ... and goes against epiphenomenalism.
<br>
<p>How do you answer this method of &quot;proving&quot; MVT?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes.  Philosophy of mind is a stupid discipline.  But you can't beat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us on our own turf.  Just drop the philosophy, stick to the science,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and let's get ON with it.
</em><br>
<p>I fully intend to pull the turf away from under your feet! &quot;Philosophy&quot;
<br>
(love of argument) cannot be roped off and protected in the way
<br>
you would like ... weasel words cannot stop the march of progress.
<br>
<p>So I don't accept your notion of MVT' ... because knowledge is seamless.
<br>
The mind-body problem ... only like can interact with like, therefore how
<br>
does the (observable) brain manifest (non-observable) mentation .... can
<br>
be dissolved by the MVT explanation in terms of a illusionary sense-organ
<br>
which is nevertheless continuous (even supervenient, in Jaegwon Kim's
<br>
mereological sense of this silly word, perhaps) with the brain matrix.
<br>
<p>An illusionary body part can deals with the illusionary world of conscious
<br>
events.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It uses a different algorithm from the one Kasparov uses.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Kasparov uses an algorithm too.  (His is certainly better, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hard to read off from the neurons, and ever trickier to program.)
</em><br>
<p>The human player tends to use entirely different approaches, Casablanca
<br>
for example said that he only ever looked one move ahead, &quot;but the best
<br>
move!&quot;
<br>
<p>Anyway, you haven't explained away the programmers needed for Deep Blue ...
<br>
Kasparov can modify whatever heuristics he uses as a result of feedback from
<br>
outcomes, but bugs in Deep Blue needs programmers .... homunculi.
<br>
<p>Will get round to dealing with your other points when I have more time.
<br>
But to date, nothing you have said convinces me much. Why do you bother
<br>
to plow a trough which you think is sterile and pointless? Science can throw
<br>
up new solutions and information, but it seems your type of tautologous
<br>
speculation
<br>
can never get anywhere. Best to ASSUME we have free will, even if cannot
<br>
ultimate know it to be so ... if we assume fatalism and determinism then no
<br>
point ever doing anything? (Fatalism and determinism just as much conceptual
<br>
make-believe as free will incidentally).
<br>
<p>Best
