<em>&gt; It's going to be an arms race for some, and open arms for others. I

</em><br>
<p>Good idea. I hope you don't keep your strategies private, but share them?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More people should adopt technology more mindfully than they seem to, I

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have a perfect track record by any means.
</em><br>
<p>So privacy issues are rather personal, and not to be distributed too
<br>
widely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some people boggle to discover that many Plain Folk in Pennsylvania have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cell phones. This is because they think the Amish are luddites, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are not. They are, however, very selective about the technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they adopt. More power to that, say I.
</em><br>
<p>I saw a documentary on PBS about the Amish. They don't let their kids go
<br>
beyond the eighth grade, because it might tempt them to discard literal
<br>
belief in the Bible. (They believe the Earth is flat, because the Bible
<br>
mentions &quot;the four corners of the Earth&quot;).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think secluded glens off the information superhighway are a fine idea,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if some of them have razor wire around them. If you can keep 'em.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, those are very secure places. I think they're called &quot;prisons&quot; and
<br>
&quot;penitentiaries&quot;
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,

<p><p>Information wanting to be free:
<br>
Here none think of wealth or fame,
<br>
All talk of right and wrong is quelled:
<br>
In autumn I rake the leaf-banked stream,
<br>
In spring attend the nightingale.
<br>
Who dares approach the lion's
<br>
Mountain cave? Cold, robust,
<br>
A Zen-person through and through,
<br>
I let the spring breeze enter at the gate.
