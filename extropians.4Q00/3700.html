<p><p><em>&gt; To further expound on this copy-question, try this thought experiment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resulting in six different copies.  I am not trying to prove a point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, and don't know what the &quot;right&quot; answer is.  I just want to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which copy people think is the best continuation of themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your original, one-and-only body and brain are kidnapped by a mad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientist.  (Knowing this list, it's a possibility!)  The scientist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes an exact copy of your body.  The scientist then transfers your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete memory into the copy.  While doing this, your memories are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely erased in your original body.  The computer also keeps a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buffered-memory copy of the operation and runs a comparison against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to verify that the copy is accurate.  After the mad scientist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finishes, the brilliant idea occurs that he can make the copy better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the original.  A second duplicate is made, but this one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredibly sexier, younger, smarter, and healthier than your original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body, while it has the same memories and mannerisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We now have these four entities:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Number 1, dubbed &quot;the original&quot;, is a total amnesiac with no memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatsoever, but fingerprints indicate it is you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That's me, the original. Unfortunately I'm amnesiac, which really sucks,
<br>
although maybe it feels ok. But without memories,
<br>
even though it's me, it's not me too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Number 2, dubbed &quot;the copy&quot;, is apparently you, looks exactly like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you, and has your exact memories and behavior mannerisms.
</em><br>
<p>If I were the copy, then I would be me, no doubt about it. Fabulous. No
<br>
problems. I remember my whole life, I have subjective experience of
<br>
being the old me, right up until the point where I close my eyes and woke up
<br>
on the other side of the room, in apparently the same body,
<br>
although I've been told that the drooling amnesiac in the corner is actually
<br>
the original.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, being the original that I am, I would not be the copy.
<br>
Instead, I'm the drooling amnesiac, and only a shadow of my former self. I
<br>
hope the copies avenge me; this was a pretty mean stunt.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Number 3, dubbed &quot;the youth&quot;, is physically better off than you were,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but otherwise has your exact memories and behavior mannerisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Now I've been teleported into a cooler body! Awesome! But, I do know, in a
<br>
logical sense, that &quot;me&quot; that was before is now stuffed; that's not very
<br>
nice!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Number 4, dubbed &quot;the simulation&quot;, is a computer-generated simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of you.  It is a projected picture on a computer screen that claims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be you, and seems to have all your exact memories and mannerisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I'm in a computer! Awesome! That's so awesome! No more RSI from keyboards
<br>
for me.
<br>
<p>But that scientist has got a wupping coming for stuffing the original
<br>
around, the bastard. If I can just find an entry into his network, his files
<br>
are toast...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To carry this even further, imagine that the scientist loads your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories back into your meat brain, and then replaces each neuron of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the original's brain with a machine neuron.  This is done one neuron
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at a time, and your brain keeps functioning while this is done.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eventually, the original brain is completely replaced with mechanical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neurons.  Strangely, the mad scientist's assistant has reassembled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the neurons into a completely functioning meat brain, and has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transplanted it into a monkey.  We now have:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Number 5, dubbed &quot;the android&quot;, with a completely mechanical brain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with all your exact memories and mannerisms.
</em><br>
<p>When the meat brain was reinstated, it might be me, or it might not. It'll
<br>
be someone, but I'd bet the amnesia was enough to disrupt the sense of self
<br>
from the original to this new copy. Perhaps if the memory wiping and
<br>
reinstating were done while the original was conscious, it might be the same
<br>
person in some trivial sense.
<br>
<p>Whoever is in this copy when the memory is reinstated, remains the same
<br>
consciousness during the incremental neuron replacement. The transition is
<br>
gradual and transparent enough that it wouldn't affect the fuzzy object that
<br>
is consciousness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Number 6, dubbed &quot;the chimp&quot;, which looks like a chimp with a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain pan, which seems to have all your exact memories and mannerisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is a new copy, different from the android (which has the strongest,
<br>
although still weak, claim to be &quot;me&quot;). I'm pretty pissed off at being
<br>
turned into a chimp! I'm gonna find a pointy banana, and shove it where the
<br>
sun don't shine, you bastard scientist freak!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which entity is &quot;you&quot;?  Any of them?  All of them?  Some of them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note that I destroyed the original.  The amnesiac original is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most obvious choice for body continuation, but it had no memory or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personality.  The chimp now contains the original meat brain with all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its data, but the android alone maintained continuous functioning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the original meat-brain and a replacement.  The copy is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; closest to what the original was like before, whereas the youth seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be the best restoration of the original to good health.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation exists in cyberspace and probably has the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibilities of all the bodies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How would we rate these entities in probability of being &quot;you&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>All of them are &quot;you&quot;, in their own subjective experience. The android may
<br>
even be correct in that feeling, even if only trivially.
<br>
<p>In a significant way, the original me was destroyed, by the amnesiac
<br>
experience.
<br>
<p>Now if the android had been created without the initial amnesia inflicted on
<br>
the original, then the Android would really be me, I think. That's my  most
<br>
favoured upload plan.
