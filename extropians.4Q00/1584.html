<em>&gt; Is it possible to compress enough air and keep it in tanks small enough to

<em>&gt; Here is a link from the BBC:

</em><br>
<p>Compressed air can only store about as much energy as vaporizing liquid
<br>
air, so an analysis I did of LN2 propulsion a while back applies:
<br>
<p>To a first approximation, it's like a noncondensing steam powered
<br>
car that needs no fuel for the boiler (but needs lots and lots of
<br>
makeup water).  The specific heat of nitrogen is far lower than that
<br>
of water, but if we assume 1 J/g-K (typical for air at STP), and
<br>
warming from 77 to 273 K (call dT=200 to make it easier), that's 200
<br>
kJ/kg of LN2.  The carnot efficiency is high thanks to the very low
<br>
Tlow, 74% theoretically, so with losses call it 100 kJ/kg delivered
<br>
usable work.
<br>
<p>Good liquid-cooled piston engines are under 0.5 lb/hp-hr (arrgh I
<br>
hate slug-feet-furlong units), call it 4E6 ft-lbs/lb, or about 5.3E6
<br>
J/kg.  This is more than 50 times the energy/mass of LN2, so an LN2
<br>
vehicle would get about 1/50th the mileage of a gasoline vehicle.
<br>
Somewhere in the range of 1/20 to 1/100, given my broad assumptions
<br>
above.
<br>
<p>Thus, its range would be poorer than an electric car, and the coal
<br>
to rubber on road efficiency would be abysmal- liquefying air fights
<br>
thermodynamics all the way.
<br>
<p>LN2 is priced at around $.05/lb in bulk, or $.35/gal... about the
<br>
same as gasoline before federal and state taxes to pay for
<br>
roadways.  At 1/20th to 1/100th the mileage of gasoline, LN2 is not
<br>
economically or technically feasible as an automobile fuel.
<br>
<p>Neat toy, though.
