&quot;Techno(Daniel Ust)transcendence&quot; chimed,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the thing to do is find activities that give one the exercize while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being fun in themselves.  For example, I like to hike and roller blade.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not like to pump iron.  So, I do the former a lot in hopes this will make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up for not doing traditional exercizes.  (It's not laziness with me, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boredom.)  Along these lines, there are many activities which can do this --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walking, biking, various sports (tennis, swimming, volley ball).
</em><br>
<p>Good ideas. I got a mountain bike. So now I'll go and check the mail (a communal
<br>
cluster box) to get some exercise while monitoring the local postal atrocities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wonder about the level of health on this list.  How often do members get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; check ups?  have their blood tested?  How many are on healthy diets?  not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overweight?  take supplements?  One would hope people who are interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximum lifespans are doing this more than the rest of the population, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the few people I've met over the years -- admittedly, not a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sample, since it is small and extemely biased:) -- it seems like it's more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk than action.
</em><br>
<p>I recently got a complete physical (well, I still have to go for a pulmonary
<br>
function test), and guess what...
<br>
I've got thirty more years to live by the estimate of my esteemed VA medical
<br>
team.
<br>
Whoopie! Thirty years of liver abuse have not yet put me under.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is sad, since lots of nontraumatic, preventable things can kill NOW,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as heart disease and certain other easily prevented diseases.
</em><br>
<p>Well, you know, Dan... exercise is (in a way) carcinogenic, because as it
<br>
prevents heart disease, it lets us live long enough to die from cancer.
<br>
<p>Anyway ... Thank you for your generous concern.
<br>
<p>&quot;Live long and prosper.&quot; --Spock
