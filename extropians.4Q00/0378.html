<p>Space foam
<br>
<p>THE WEIRD properties of a mysterious foam have been measured for the
<br>
first time. The US Air Force researchers who did the job say the foam
<br>
could replace several different types of material, including glass
<br>
fibre and aluminium honeycomb, in planes and spacecraft.
<br>
<p>Called graphitic foam, it was first made at the US Air Force Research
<br>
Laboratory at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. They melted
<br>
a liquid crystal polymer under pressure in an inert gas atmosphere,
<br>
forcing the gas to dissolve in the melt. When the pressure was
<br>
released, bubbles of gas formed inside the material, creating
<br>
foam. Heating this in an oxygen atmosphere formed graphite crystals,
<br>
which are extremely strong.
<br>
<p>Researchers first tried to measure the foam's mechanical properties by
<br>
gluing strain gauges to it, but glue seeped into the foam and changed
<br>
its composition. Now the researchers at AFRL have built precision
<br>
equipment to carry out extensive tests, which showed that the foam has
<br>
three times the stiffness of aluminium honeycomb.  And unlike
<br>
fibre-based composites and honeycombs, which are strong in only two
<br>
dimensions, the graphitic foam retains its properties in three
<br>
dimensions.
<br>
<p>These properties mean it can perform several functions at once. For
<br>
example, in a space shuttle it could carry heat and electrical charge
<br>
from one part of the structure to another, and provide mechanical
<br>
strength.
