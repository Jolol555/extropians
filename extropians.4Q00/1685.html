<p>I'm more bothered by suggestions that the number generator is
<br>
systematically biased in a way that gives rise to darwinnowing. I like the
<br>
idea, but I don't know of any physcial rationale for it. Here's a bit from
<br>
THE LAST MORTAL GENERATION that addresses this issue. Mitch Porter once
<br>
offered a comment on this point but it eluded me:
<br>
<p>================
<br>
Physicist Lee Smolin has suggested that black holes extrude out of our
<br>
universe and expand as Bangs into new universes, re-mixing the laws of
<br>
nature a tad each time, a line of thought similar to Hawking's.  Smolin's
<br>
story involves infinities of time, cosmos following cosmos, universes
<br>
giving birth to baby universes that Bang and expand and fade into
<br>
attenuated living death or perhaps are crushed into fiery nothing - but not
<br>
before giving birth to billions of new baby spacetimes of their own.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core idea stems from the mathematical discovery, crucial to quantum
<br>
theory, that the vacuum - emptiness - is unstable and liable to emit
<br>
energetic particles.  What's more, the briefer this catastrophe, the
<br>
greater the available energy.  At high enough energies, this flaw in
<br>
emptiness can buckle inward to form a black hole, which may then inflate
<br>
wildly to form an entire segregated cosmos.  Depending on the interaction
<br>
laws coded into that cosmos, it might recollapse in a tiny fraction of a
<br>
second, bubble with micro-black holes that collapse in turn, or even blow
<br>
out into a fresh spacetime universe akin to our own.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine, then, a fabulous series of popping bubbles in the void.  Most
<br>
vanish with no progeny.  Some persist long enough for their colossal
<br>
outpouring of energy to form elemental vibrating strings and membranes, and
<br>
for those to coalesce into quarks and electrons, and then into hydrogen and
<br>
helium atoms.  If the values describing the new universe are suitable, its
<br>
contents may form stars that cook new, heavier elements in their compressed
<br>
gasses.  Some of these, rich in carbon and other key elements, will explode
<br>
in thermonuclear glory, their cores crushed down to black holes, their hot
<br>
debris seeding the skies with the raw materials of life and new stars.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few universes, Smolin speculates, an extraordinary set of values will
<br>
coincide, yielding two interesting features: a maximum number of stars
<br>
suitable for making black holes (and hence new universes with slightly
<br>
variant parameters) and many other stars and their planets suitable for
<br>
evolving life, and even intelligence.  The key step in this somewhat
<br>
Darwinian argument is that the parameters determining the shape of the new
<br>
cosmos must resemble those of its parent, rather than being picked at
<br>
random.  Granted this, after a while most universes in the mega-cosmos will
<br>
cluster around certain apparently arbitrary values - the kind that produce
<br>
observers like us.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By re-mixing the fundamental parameters a tad each time, eventually (by a
<br>
process more akin to Gerald Edelman's `neural darwinism' than to genuine
<br>
Darwinism, in which phenotypes compete in the same environment for air
<br>
time) certain kinds of fecund universes will dominate. As a
<br>
side-consequence, it might be that these kinds are hospitable to life.
<br>
Suppose a set of laws congenial to the manufacture of abundant black holes
<br>
will birth more universes just like mother.  Barren ensembles of laws will
<br>
die out.  After a while, most of the universes in superspace will be
<br>
fertile.  Smolin believes ours is just that kind.  Intriguingly, most black
<br>
holes are made when very large stars explode as supernovae, which also
<br>
happen to build the elements of life out of the simpler elements originally
<br>
forming those stars.  So it's a side-effect of universes that make oodles
<br>
of black holes that they need to hang about long enough for such stars to
<br>
form, to explode, to seed the cosmic dust with the making of life, which
<br>
will then evolve and start wondering about the meaning of life.  And the
<br>
beauty of Smolin's suggestion is that it's testable.  It moves out of the
<br>
domain of faith and into that of science. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more extreme possibility is that once life arises by chance and thrives,
<br>
it will thereafter manipulate the parameters in one or more of the baby
<br>
universes such that life-supportive universes (perhaps available for
<br>
colonisation via wormholes) become prevalent.  This wild notion has been
<br>
explored by cosmologist Edward Hamilton in the sombre pages of the
<br>
Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am attracted to Smolin's view of a Darwinian metauniverse replete with
<br>
`gosh numbers' - as Frederik Pohl calls the relevant `dimensionless' values
<br>
which describe reality's architecture - selected by the fecundity of their
<br>
local bubbles.  However, he not only gives no mechanism for mutating the
<br>
fundamental values, he provides no hint of why they should be constrained.
<br>
Neither of the Darwinian prerequisites for natural selection are present.
<br>
There's no reason to suppose that systematic and heritable variations would
<br>
occur between bangs (rather than none at all or, more plausibly, wildly
<br>
divergent ones), and there's no competition for resources.   You can start
<br>
a baby universe just by goosing an infinitesimal wormhole.  Cosmic
<br>
inflation does the rest.  Pure science!  Pure magic!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall the logic of organic evolution.  Suppose that the earth had been an
<br>
infinite flat plain, or plane, in which various regions were connected by
<br>
hyperspatial wormholes.  Then the original pre-DNA self-bootstrapping
<br>
critter might have spread through the ooze forever, chomping and mutating
<br>
and dividing as it went.  But there'd be no concerted contest to drive
<br>
evolution, so everything (it seems to me) might stay pretty much at slime
<br>
level, unless complexity theory and such controversial factors kick in and
<br>
smarten things up eventually.  Smolin's story gives no mechanism for
<br>
mutating the fundamental values, nor does it provide a hint of why they
<br>
should be constrained.  Stars allegedly evolve `to make best use,' as
<br>
science writer John Gribbin summarises the theory, `of the available
<br>
materials'.  But there is no coding transmitted between stellar generations
<br>
and no memory substrate to mutate - just a shift in the population of raw
<br>
elements from previous supernovae generations.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching galactic spiral arms, Gribbin has suggested, it is obvious you're
<br>
seeing a living system.  By this reasoning, the water vortex I saw tonight
<br>
in my bath was also alive, poor little thing.  `Many universes,' he claims,
<br>
`are competing with one another for the right to exist'.  But the
<br>
mathematics of this story tell us the universes are orthogonal, at
<br>
right-angles to each other, so to speak.  So it is difficult to see how
<br>
they can `compete'.  And for what resource?
