<p>I disagree with your evaluation of LeGuin.  Her prose style can sometimes be
<br>
intractable.  That said, I went through a phase where I read a few of her
<br>
novels.  However, I was disappointed with _The Dispossessed_.
<br>
<p>I thought PBS film version of &quot;The Lathe of Heaven&quot; was so so.  So so
<br>
acting.  So so sets.  So so plot and story.  However, I watched it several
<br>
times just because the story kind of sticks with you.
