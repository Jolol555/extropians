&nbsp;It means we can crawl around and drive souped up pickup trucks with
<br>
&nbsp;improvised brush armor like in _Terminator_, because we won't be too
<br>
&nbsp;high profile to survive the first wave, whoever gets the upper hand...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Oh wait, maybe that's BAD...

I am guessing that director, James Cameron, would love your ideas; because 
<br>
his appeal (quite a bit) to Luddite tendencies. Ok, its a cautionary tale 
<br>
based on some of the fiction of Harlan Ellision. What about the concept 
<br>
(weird as it may sound) that the A.I.'s and S.I.'s that follow are &quot;nice&quot; to 
<br>
us? It would cost them very little in the way of energy/material/calculations 
<br>
to do so. So they take us along on their journey's through the universe, and 
<br>
eventually they build interesting virtual and non-virtual worlds for us and 
<br>
them. We could make our own nightmares yes, but some of the worst ones are 
<br>
ones external to us, like disease, and climate change (little ice ice) and so 
<br>
forth. Nukes could do this too, as depicted in Terminator.
