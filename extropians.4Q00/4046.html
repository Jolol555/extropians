&nbsp;
<br>

&nbsp;
<br>
Well, originally I was talking about Swedish law, they being the ones making
<br>
the specific change (and eager to get the EU to come along.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was trying to show a point by providing a range of examples, that should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illustrate my meaning when seen together from a little higher view. The next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta level so to speak. You are counter arguing by trying to show that every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little example is wrong. I know that some of these examples are wrong, but
</em><br>
<p>Wrong and irrelevant.  The new Swedish rules (as reported) are aimed at
<br>
particular attributes of substances, attributes which are a priori highly
<br>
indicative of being dangerous.  
<br>
<p>To make an analogy of my own, it's not &quot;all new chemicals are bad&quot;, but &quot;all
<br>
new chemicals which are close relatives of cyanide are probably bad&quot;.  Except
<br>
instead of &quot;cyanide&quot; it's &quot;persistent and accumulates in living creatures&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that is experience speaking. But nobody could know beforehand that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where wrong.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Afterhand, however, we've learned that strange things which accumulate up the
<br>
food chain tend to cause problems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I said before. We know this now. We didn't before. Should we have stopped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electricity until we knew what we know now? Because then we would never had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known what we know now about electricity. Sort of a catch 22.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I suspect we knew EM waves pretty well before high power transmission lines
<br>
became feasible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there is no movement in the water, as is the case in some of the low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waters here, and the removal of the fertilizers happens slower than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount added each year, I would call that accumulative. But then again it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not really the point here.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It is the point.  Sure, they're accumulating in still water.  They're not
<br>
bioaccumulative.  They don't concentrate more and more in each creature up the
<br>
food chain, ending in us; they get eaten and turned into plant matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am still not wealthy enough to live &quot;forever&quot;. Until I am there is nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gained for me to slow any economic/technological growth.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
What if pollution increases the chance you'll die soon more than the
<br>
technology bought by the pollution decreases that chance?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am as concerned about the enviroment as the next guy. That is not really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point. I just don't want us to be overly cautious because of some eco
</em><br>
<p>And I don't see how the Swedish rules, as stated, are anything close to being
<br>
overly cautious.
