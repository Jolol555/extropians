<em>&gt; Typing certainly doesn't require consciousness.  I recall one occasion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I turned around to talk to someone - my brother, in fact - and found,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I turned back, that some keywords had been typed on the screen.  At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the very least, the word-to-finger connection is direct and does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require conscious attention.  That being the case, it seems quite possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a slip of the fingers could occur independently of a slip of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind's tongue.  ...
</em><br>
<p>Last I heard it's fairly well possible to have two distinct channels
<br>
you communicate meaningfully on.  One should be audio and one visual.
<br>
If you can type by sight (not pronouncing the words in your head by
<br>
visualizing how the typed conversation will look) you can probably
<br>
speak simultaneously.  If you use the speech channel for both you
<br>
probably can't do them simultaneously.  I've known at least one
<br>
accomplished hacker and one dilettante English maven who can carry on
<br>
100+ wpm typing conversations while talking fluidly.  People who use
<br>
the same channel for both lines can learn to buffer, though, and use
<br>
alternating bursty message forming sessions which can then be each
<br>
indepently slowly dumped for reasonably steady output on both lines.
<br>
This is how I manage to talk and do email at the same time.  Drives
<br>
some people bananas though, as they insist I can't really be listening
<br>
to them while typing to someone else.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
James
