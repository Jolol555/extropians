</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is a cool piece of technology because it works in 3D.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, you note they claim: &quot;2,750 nanometers (nm)&quot; which
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Much better sources for information on the P4 include:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; which has much more technical detail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Anandtech article says they are planning on using EUVL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 157nm deep UV lithography to implement the 30nm gate lengths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by 2005.  If accurate, that *would* be a significant breakthrough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I haven't seen anything indicating there would be production
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember this is *Intel* we are talking about and I'm fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure the Itanium is more than a year late...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; Also notice the fine print in one of the articles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;...Intel focusing on voice and face recognition...&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are having a very hard time finding uses for the speed.
</em><br>
<p>Some additional comments:
<br>
<p>Technical overview of the Itanium is here:
<br>
<a href="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/hardware/guides/itanium/">http://www.sharkyextreme.com/hardware/guides/itanium/</a>
<br>
and
<br>
<a href="http://www1.anandtech.com/showdoc.html?i=1175">http://www1.anandtech.com/showdoc.html?i=1175</a>
<br>
and the slashdot discussion:
<br>
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/12/04/0442206">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/12/04/0442206</a>
<br>
<p>The migration from the P III (which is really a Pentium Pro)
<br>
to the P4 is doubling the number of pipline stages which
<br>
allows them to increase the clock speed.  I'm a bit fuzzy
<br>
on why more stages is better.  It may have to do with being
<br>
able to make the operations each stage does &quot;simpler&quot; and
<br>
therefore smaller on the chip, therefore reducing propagation
<br>
delay limits.  One of the problems with simply increasing
<br>
chip speed is that it makes the processors consume more power,
<br>
thus running hotter and shortening their life.  Intel is betting
<br>
on the fact that &quot;speed&quot; sells, not benchmarks.  Because the P4
<br>
is going to move from a 0.18 micron process to 0.13 microns you
<br>
can lower the voltage (reducing power consumption) and still run the
<br>
chip faster.  Moving to the smaller process lets Intel produce
<br>
more chips per wafer which increases profit.
<br>
<p>The real advantages to the P4 will show up when you run them
<br>
on motherboards and memory that have higher data rates.  Right
<br>
now many operations are memory bandwidth constrained, so the
<br>
P4s will tend to look poor in benchmarks even though they
<br>
are running at higher speeds.  { Read -- when you are buying
<br>
systems go for the system with the highest bus speed. }
<br>
<p>The Itanium helps somewhat because it has a much more parallel
<br>
internal architecture.  It simply has more of everything.
<br>
The Itanium will not perform well without a *very* good
<br>
compiler.  Intel is moving as much of the the instruction scheduling
<br>
and interference checking that is done on the chip in architectures
<br>
like the Alpha and current Pentium's out to the compile stage.
<br>
To make your programs run really fast, Itaniums may be performing
<br>
both the &quot;then&quot; and &quot;else&quot; clauses of an &quot;if-then-else&quot; statement
<br>
and then throw one result away when it gets the results of
<br>
evaluating the &quot;if&quot; conditional.  That is a recipe for really
<br>
wasting energy though you will get your results sooner.
<br>
<p>Ultimately the current architectures are doomed but they are
<br>
unlikely to change soon.  A radical shift to processor-in-memory
<br>
architectures is required to eliminate the processor-memory
<br>
bandwidth limit.  That could be solved by optical motherboard
<br>
interconnects (remember my slide from Extro III?) or by a radical
<br>
shift in processor/memory architectures, something IBM is doing
<br>
with Blue Gene for example.  The problem is that new architectures
<br>
will probably require new programming paradigms because current
<br>
languages and programmers don't adapt well to massively parallel
<br>
processor-in-memory systems.
<br>
<p>Actually, if the Intel announcements prove to be more than vapor-press,
<br>
and they really can implement a 0.07 micron (70 nm) with 30 nm gates
<br>
process by 2005 they will be accelerating up Moore's Law by 5-8 years
<br>
over the 1997 SIA Roadmap! See:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/petaflops/siardmap.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/petaflops/siardmap.html</a>
<br>
<p>Its going to be really interesting to see the next version of the
<br>
SIA Roadmap to see if the industry consensus matches the Intel
<br>
Press department.
