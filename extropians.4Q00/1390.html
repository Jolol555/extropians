<br>
<p>OCTOBER 20 IS NATIONAL MAMMOGRAPHY DAY
<br>
LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
<p>As part of our ongoing acknowledgement of the month of October as breast
<br>
cancer awareness month, Life Extension Update presents further
<br>
breakthroughs in the field of breast cancer diagnosis and theory.
<br>
<p>Optical mammography may make surgical biopsies obsolete
<br>
<p>A hand held laser device is in the works that can locate breast tumors and
<br>
determine whether or not they are malignant.  Currently, when a mammogram
<br>
and ultrasound indicate suspicious tissue, a woman must undergo a
<br>
sometimes painful needle biopsy, and, if the results indicate it, a costly
<br>
surgical biopsy, which is also painful,involves outpatient
<br>
hospitalization, and leaves a scar.  Worse than this, however, is that
<br>
surgeons may fail to remove the intended tissue because of the difficulty
<br>
in pinpointing the location of suspicious areas shown on mammograms,
<br>
forcing the patient to endure more waiting and further biopsy.
<br>
<p>Beckman Laser Institute at the University of California, Irvine, is
<br>
currently testing a noninvasive, hand-held laser as part of a study of the
<br>
ability of the drugs tamoxifen and raloxifene to prevent cancer.   The
<br>
laser uses near-infrared light to map the optical signature of breast
<br>
tissue.  The new device is similar to transluminators developed twenty
<br>
years ago, but much more effective.  The earlier devices did not have the
<br>
sensitivity required to calculate absorption and scattering of light.  The
<br>
device uses the idea that light travels differently through malignant
<br>
tissue than it does normal tissue, and this difference is analyzed by a
<br>
computer. The latest device is so sensitive that it can detect monthly and
<br>
lifetime hormonal changes in breast tissue.
<br>
<p>Jerome Spanier, PhD, Claremont Graduate University Senior Fellow and
<br>
Director, and developer of the device's mathematical support system
<br>
commented, &quot;The laser probe itself is exquisitely sensitive to subtle
<br>
tissue changes and our mathematical algorithm contributes to a deeper
<br>
understanding of how the normal tissue and the cancerous tissue differ.&quot;
<br>
<p>Product developer, Bruce Tromberg, PhD, Beckman Laser Institute Laser
<br>
Microbeam and Medical Program Director Fellow and Director, is currently
<br>
measuring tamoxifen and raloxifene's effectiveness with the device, which
<br>
is not yet approved for widespread use.  He stated, &quot;We are pushing it to
<br>
the next level.  It is an emerging technology.&quot;
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Older oral contraceptives up breast cancer risk
<br>
<p>In a study published in the October 11 issue of the Journal of the
<br>
American Medical Association, researchers discovered that the use of oral
<br>
contraceptives before 1975 significantly increased the risk of breast
<br>
cancer in the sisters and daughters of 246 women diagnosed with breast
<br>
cancer between 1944 and 1952. In an effort to determine whether the
<br>
association between the use of oral contraceptives and breast cancer is
<br>
influenced by a family history of the disease, researchers conducted a
<br>
telephone survey of 394 sister and daughters, 3002 granddaughters and
<br>
nieces, and 2754 women who married into the families of the original 246
<br>
breast cancer patients.
<br>
<p>The researchers conclude with the recommendation that first-degree
<br>
relatives of breast cancer patients who have used oral contraceptives be
<br>
particularly vigilant concerning breast cancer screening.

<br>
<p><p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Cancer radiation
<br>
<p>Radiation therapy is given to about 60% of all cancer patients, but may
<br>
inflict tremendous tissue damage to healthy cells. Radiotherapy can also
<br>
cause secondary cancers after the primary cancer has been treated, leading
<br>
to secondary diseases such as pneumonitis and radiation fibrosis.
<br>
Radiation therapy is associated with both acute and late disease
<br>
conditions that affect a patient's nutritional status.
<br>
<p>Radiation therapy relies on the local destruction of cancer cells through
<br>
ionizing radiation that disrupts cellular DNA. Radiation therapy can be
<br>
externally or internally originated, high or low dose, and delivered with
<br>
computer-assisted accuracy to the site of the tumor. Brachytherapy, or
<br>
interstitial radiation therapy, places the source of radiation directly
<br>
into the tumor as implanted &quot;seeds.&quot;
<br>
<p>The amino acid taurine is severely depleted when people undergo radiation
<br>
therapy. The March 1992 issue of the American Journal of Clinical
<br>
Nutrition suggested a possible therapeutic effect of taurine
<br>
supplementation relative to radiation therapy. Supplementation with 2000
<br>
mg a day of taurine is, therefore, recommended to people undergoing cancer
<br>
radiation therapy.
<br>
<p>In animal studies, when ginseng was administered along with radiation
<br>
therapies, a far greater percentage of the animals survived in the
<br>
ginseng-supplemented group, compared with the group administered radiation
<br>
without ginseng. Cancer patients should consider taking 2 to 4 capsules
<br>
daily of Sports Ginseng by Nature's Herbs, which combines Korean and
<br>
Siberian ginseng.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Taurine capsules
<br>
<p>Taurine is one the most abundant amino acids found in the body. It is
<br>
found throughout the excitable tissues of the central nervous system,
<br>
where it is thought to have a regulating influence. Because of this,
<br>
taurine supplements have been found to control epileptic seizures, motor
<br>
tics and facial twitches.
<br>
<p>L-taurine is an amino acid in which many individuals are deficient.
<br>
L-taurine has recently been reported to prevent cataracts and certain
<br>
forms of heart disease. Cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy
<br>
become taurine deficient.

<br>
<p>Sports Ginseng
<br>
<p>Sports Ginseng is the highest quality and most effective form of ginseng
<br>
for athletes who train and compete at peak levels, and for active men and
<br>
women of all ages in search of good health and vibrant energy. Sports
<br>
Ginseng is standardized at the preferred concentration of naturally
<br>
balanced active and co-active constituents, including ginsenosides,
<br>
panaxosides and eleutherosides, while retaining and enhancing all the
<br>
whole root synergistic benefits which are so significant in natural herbs.
<br>
Sports Ginseng provides the ginseng in its properly balanced ratios of the
<br>
different ginsenoside groups including Rg and Rb.
<br>
<p>Korean (panax) ginseng is renowned worldwide for helping to promote good
<br>
health, endurance and vitality. It has been a staple of Oriental medicine
<br>
for 5,000 years and is respected for its invigorating value. Siberian
<br>
(Eleutherococcus) ginseng is also one of the world's favorite and most
<br>
honored herbs. Recent scientific research suggests that it helps promote
<br>
better health, well-being and greater levels of physical performance.
<br>
Siberian ginseng is approved for institutional use in the former Soviet
<br>
Union and is regularly consumed by Olympic athletes, resulting in improved
<br>
performance.

<p><p>LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE OCTOBER 2000
<br>
New data on the dangers of hormone replacement therapy
<br>
<p>Data on the risks of prescription hormones is stacking up at the same time
<br>
that the benefits are becoming increasingly questionable. Drugs such as
<br>
Premarin cause cancer with or without added progestins. Adding progestins
<br>
simply moves the cancer to another organ.
<br>
<p>A new study from the University of Toronto is the latest to show that
<br>
prescription estrogen greatly increases the risk of endometrial cancer.
<br>
The first studies on the high risk of endometrial cancer and synthetic
<br>
estrogen were published in 1975. Subsequently it was proven that risk
<br>
could be reduced if progestins were added. That strategy has been proven
<br>
to increase the risk of breast cancer-in some cases, double it.
<br>
<p>One of the things that has recently emerged from breast cancer/drug
<br>
studies is that the combination of estrogen and progestins dramatically
<br>
increases breast density. This may confound the results of mammograms. Yet
<br>
women who do take drug hormones may have reduced mortality because they
<br>
are more likely to get a mammogram and have early detection since they are
<br>
seeing a physician on a regular basis. The answer, of course, is for women
<br>
to see a doctor regularly whether or not they're taking prescription
<br>
drugs.
