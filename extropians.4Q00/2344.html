<p>
Not that I believe in numerology, but the connection of numbers to words was
<br>
more obvious to the ancient Hebrews than it is to us today.  The Hebrew
<br>
letters were also used as numbers.  They did not have separate digits like
<br>
we do.  Unlike roman numerals, in which some letters can represent numbers,
<br>
in Hebrew all letters can be numbers.
<br>
<p>Unlike English words which have to be converted to numbers via a
<br>
correspondence code, in Hebrew every word is literally identical to some
<br>
number.  Every word had a numeric value.  If you see a fragment of Hebrew
<br>
symbols, there is no way to know whether they were letters or numbers in
<br>
their original context.  The concept that words and numbers were related was
<br>
an obvious artifact of their language system.
<br>
<p>The other complicating factor in this belief is the fact that Hebrew was
<br>
written without vowels.  Every two-symbol combination of Hebrew glyphs could
<br>
be read as a Hebrew noun or a two-digit number.  Every three-symbol
<br>
combination of Hebrew glyphs could be read as a verb or a three-digit
<br>
number.  Every five-digit combination of Hebrew glyphs could be read as a
<br>
simple noun-verb sentence as well as a five digit number.
<br>
<p>Unlike English where a random series of letters produces gibberish, in
<br>
Hebrew any random series of numbers can be read into words and sentence.  By
<br>
rolling dice, dealing cards, or casting lots, the Hebrews could read words
<br>
and sentences.  Imagine a lottery drawing where every winning combination
<br>
spells out a phrase.  Imagine if every arithmetic problems results in an
<br>
object or an idea.  In Hebrew, the first letter is Aleph.  The first number
<br>
is Aleph.  The cow in the field is Aleph.  They are all the same word or
<br>
concept used in different contexts.  The concept that words equal numbers
<br>
equal abstract concepts seemed obvious to the ancient Hebrews.
<br>
<p>This lead to the evolution of a lot of divination techniques.  It was easy
<br>
to ask a question, roll dice and read an answer.  Any roll of the dice would
<br>
give structured and intelligible answers that would put any magic 8-ball to
<br>
shame.  This also lead to superstition and fear of omens everywhere.  It was
<br>
hard to ignore daily omens when every day occurrences or groupings would
<br>
spell out words or phrases.  Imagine that the grouping of cattle in the
<br>
field, say a pair here, three there, and a dozen over there, spelled out
<br>
messages.  Consider if every flock of birds could spell out an idea.
<br>
Imagine that blades of grass could form words and sentences.  Imagine if
<br>
&quot;meanings&quot; would be automatically apparent in every grouping of objects, in
<br>
every scene or in every name.
<br>
<p>It would be easy to see these obvious signs being noticed, interpreted and
<br>
often believed to be hidden messages from some underlying force that exists
<br>
invisibly behind all reality.  This would be a form of subliminal messaging
<br>
that would be hard to avoid.  Subtle ideas and concepts would creep in
<br>
thoroughly mundane life everywhere.  Names would be instantly associated
<br>
with objects or actions.  Locations would automatically be interpreted with
<br>
meaning.
