<p>
On the Templeton list where I also lurk, people are, of course, less 
<br>
dedicated to rationalism and the Ayn Rand view as the paramount ethical 
<br>
value. Rationalism is an superb guidepost, as long as it doesn't become a 
<br>
'hitching-post' to quote an associate of mine.
<br>
<p>So where does that leave people like me (not that anyone need care!)?  To 
<br>
paraphrase the great philosopher on the American Beer coomercial for Miller 
<br>
Beer; &quot;Where is the Love, man?&quot; To which the antagonist replied, &quot;You're not 
<br>
getting my beer Bob&quot;. My concern here is not love, but a less agreeable 
<br>
attribute to desire..pity.
<br>
Someone like the icon of this group, Ayn Rand would no doubt see pity in as a 
<br>
grave weakness and a mental dysfunction, as well as a character flaw of 
<br>
Richtorian scale.
<br>
Maybe she would have been correct. However, I look at the human condition, 
<br>
nature red in tooth and claw, and such as a fact of life. But like disease 
<br>
and death, a fact which needs to be mitigated. 
<br>
<p>Now if mysticism can do the job, excellent! If pure technological prowess can 
<br>
achieve this, mondo-bondo! If someone comes up with philosophy or drugs or a 
<br>
new branch of science that can push back the pain, let me join in.
