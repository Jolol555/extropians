I've heard that investors in electric power companies have a keen interest
<br>
in things like high-temperature superconductors and mass produced fuel
<br>
cells, because of associated and potentially devastating long-term impact on
<br>
conventional utilities (traditionally attractive stocks to long-term
<br>
investors). Suppose investors, having learned of impending production of
<br>
fuel cells and the realization of high-temp superconductors, dump their
<br>
stock. Has anyone noticed the stock prices of electrical utilities in
<br>
California?
<br>
<p>Could this have anything to do with power companies whining about not being
<br>
able to supply enough power, and asking users to cut back on usage? Unless
<br>
I'm way too stoned, doesn't this help to explain the bizarre behavior of
<br>
companies that make money selling electricity, asking people to buy less of
<br>
it? Perhaps the big power companies are in trouble, and they know it, on
<br>
account of new high-tech methods of generating power. The power companies
<br>
don't relish broadcasting the news of their impending obsolescence, and
<br>
neither do their owners. But they do need to let the general public know
<br>
that power shortages may (no, shall) occur, until the new technologies are
<br>
in place. How can they explain that without appearing deceitful, especially
<br>
since none of the new alternatives seems ready to take up the slack?
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>

&nbsp;I think I must add &quot;free will&quot; to the list of &quot;consciousness&quot; &quot;phlogiston&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;vitalism&quot; and &quot;mind&quot; as examples of useless hypotheses.
