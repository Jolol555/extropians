</em><br>
<p>Sorry, John, I am hoist on my own petard. What I actually
<br>
meant to say was &quot;all measurements are expressed to a degree
<br>
of precision&quot; rather than accuracy. So then, the measurements
<br>
are not especially precise (though they are exactly the sort
<br>
of precision one would expect in a predecimal society), but
<br>
imprecision is not error. Despite your attempts to derive
<br>
a mathematical meaning to the words, the simple fact is that
<br>
it is a matter of fact statement, from which we would expect
<br>
little precision, (though hopefully no error.)
<br>
<p>Even in our time we recognize this. If I want to indicate that
<br>
an item is 1 mm long, to the nearest micron, I would express it
<br>
as 1.000mm. Or at least that is the way I was taught. Such is
<br>
an acknowledgement that accuracy &lt;&gt; precision.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I expect just a little bit more, after all, he can thumb his nose at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. For that matter he could just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change the value of PI so the passage would be correct, but He
</em><br>
<em>&gt;didn't. And He did something even more unforgivable, I expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better writing ability from God than the Japanese gentleman who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrote the &quot;English&quot; assembly instructions for my stereo cabinet.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what Heisenberg has to do with it, however, it is
<br>
clear that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a
<br>
round object is not always pi. If the round object is slightly
<br>
elliptical, there are a range of &quot;diameters&quot;, some of which give
<br>
a ratio less than pi, some more.
<br>
<p>Once again, it seems to be assumed that this object was a mathematical
<br>
experiment. It was not. It was not even a description of how to
<br>
make a particular object. It was simply a description of an object,
<br>
according to the precision of the time. There is no reason to believe
<br>
that the dimensions were exact (in fact, it is essentially impossible
<br>
to make anything exactly the length of some standard unit of measure)
<br>
and there is no reason to believe it was a mathematically perfect
<br>
circle.
<br>
<p>You might say, well the omnipotent God could make a perfect circle
<br>
or an item with an exact length. Perhaps you'd be right. However,
<br>
this object, as is evident from the passage, was not made by God,
<br>
but by a bronzeworker named Hiram.
<br>
<p>So once again, it is perfectly possible to make a circle diameter
<br>
ten cubits, circumference 30 cubits, as long as you recognize that
<br>
this means &quot;to the nearest cubit&quot;. Which hardly seems an unreasonable
<br>
assumption.
<br>
<p>If you really want to prove that this passage is in error, you need
<br>
to prove both of these two things: one that the measurements were
<br>
meant to be taken to a precision greater than the one stated, and
<br>
two, that the object described as &quot;round&quot; was a perfect circle (or
<br>
a close approximation of a circle to a high degree of precision).
<br>
I don't think either is provable, in fact, I think both are
<br>
extremely unlikely to be true. 
<br>
<p>However, as I said, I feel a little uncomfortable with this discussion
<br>
here. It is not at all relevant to the subject of this list. I feel
<br>
particularly so as a new contributor. So, as the saying goes, that is
<br>
all she wrote.
