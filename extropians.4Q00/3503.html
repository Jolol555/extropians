Hello Hal.
<br>
<p>----- Original Message -----
<br>
From: &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Immortality&In-Reply-To=&lt;006001c0609a$cc0ce0c0$d2147318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">hal@finney.org</a>&gt;

<p><p><em>&gt; Now ask, what kinds of changes or transformations to your program would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permissible in various models of identity?  Can the program be suspended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then resumed?  Can it be moved from block to block of memory?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can portions be swapped out to disk and then brought in as needed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can it be suspended, copied to another computer, and then resumed there?
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for introducing this Hal-- I think this is probably the best way to
<br>
get to some of the core issues.
<br>
<p><p>My suspicion is that the above thought process is an abstraction of
<br>
intelligence (into the software model) that is employed by many people.
<br>
I've personally found great value in drawing these sorts of associations...
<br>
<p>...and I hope you don't think I'm being unnecessarily difficult when I say
<br>
that I believe that this sort of model for human intelligence is the precise
<br>
problem.  IMO, a human intellect running on any substrate is going to be the
<br>
result of some big, crazy emergent property factors due to the immense
<br>
complexity and adaptability of the system.  Do I think that we can damage or
<br>
collapse that emergent state of intellect by arbitrarily turning aspects of
<br>
it on and off?  Well, umm... yes I do.  Does that belief have scientific
<br>
validity in the context of Hal's idea above as expressed in the context of
<br>
traditional computer software?  No... I don't think so.
<br>
<p>My PERSONAL SUSPICION (as yet unfounded in light of our current
<br>
understanding of the human brain,) is that our consciousness runs as an
<br>
emergent sub-set of our current hardware and cannot be reduced to its
<br>
components in an effective fashion.  We are RAM.  Or rather, we are a sort
<br>
of standing wave-form generated by complex hardware-- a ghost in the
<br>
machine.
<br>
<p>If I store the state information of that standing wave-form, cut the power
<br>
(totally terminating the current iteration of said wave-form), turn the
<br>
power back on and re-instate the wave-form, is it still (that) me?
<br>
<p>Well... (and I can hear the groans already from the back of the theater) I'm
<br>
going to have to say &quot;uh... sort of no.&quot;
<br>
<p>Is there logic behind my reasoning?
<br>
<p>Yes, mostly... but at this point, I have an admission to make: I have sort
<br>
of an intuitive understanding of why I hold this belief, but to be frank, I
<br>
feel that it is right at the edge of my intellect (with regards to my
<br>
ability to describe and fully engage it.)  If you press me deeply for the
<br>
science on this, I -will- eventually have to shrug and say: &quot;Dunno.  The
<br>
mind is a mysterious thing my friend...&quot;  That IS a cop out-- come back in
<br>
10 years.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;My contention is that a *particular* iteration of the emergent wave-form
<br>
that represents my consciousness (based on the contiguous motion of a
<br>
reality experiencer along the arrow of time) is a significant, discrete,
<br>
entity/process.  This entity/process does not really exist independent of
<br>
the substrate (it is, in fact, the substrate.)
<br>
<p>If this entity/process -fails- to have a contiguous experience across time,
<br>
(as in the situation above,) it ceases to be, and its activities are resumed
<br>
by it's clone (assuming one is made.)  (Please note that in my estimation,
<br>
the point of interface with reality is gaussian across the time vector-- the
<br>
wave-form does not collapse across the tick of the Planck clock, for
<br>
instance.  The point of interface with reality of this 'flame' may actually
<br>
be -really- fuzzy, and the requisite breadth of experience continuity may be
<br>
large and a subject for future fascinating debates.)
<br>
<p>My belief is that I currently represent the sole (and original) iteration of
<br>
this 'flame' contained in my particular substrate (... still ticking...)
<br>
There are dozens of reasons why I may not be, and no way of verifying that
<br>
this belief is true, other than petitioning Occam.  (Yes, I -could- be a
<br>
robot with transplanted memories that you are even now activating, you
<br>
sinister fiend, you.)  My further belief is that any particular flame
<br>
iteration is special, unique, and contains aspects that are significantly
<br>
irreplicable. (1. I suspect we are sufficiently fine-grained for QM to play
<br>
a factor.  Hell, we probably -are- the QM.  2.  An *exact* copy must
<br>
necessarily share -every- property (including location in physical space and
<br>
time) and that ain't significantly possible within a single reality.)
<br>
<p>Does the -universe- care if I flick the power switch on and off like this?
<br>
Probably not.  Does this iteration of the Jason/flame care?  Yes, even IF it
<br>
can be shown that this is iteration #367 (although, as stated, I believe the
<br>
iterations are robust and this is still iteration #1)
<br>
<p>So why did I say &quot;sort of no&quot; above?
<br>
<p>Well, I think this model, too, is simplistic.  A particular iteration of my
<br>
entity/process may be even more fuzzy and inclusive-- that is to say, I
<br>
might be able to preserve continuity of existence across the 'power outage'
<br>
described above due to robust hardware and good active storage mechanisms.
<br>
Robust fuzziness in the future is likely to allow me to turn off, copy, and
<br>
replace portions of my matrix (just not all at once, or catastrophically.)
<br>
I am optimistic about the possibility of upload vectors that can support the
<br>
existence of a particular iteration across substrates.
<br>
<p>Nine Tough Questions You Haven't Asked Me Yet:
<br>
<p>1. &quot;Is it logical to cling to a particular iteration?&quot;
<br>
<p>For some, perhaps not.  I've got a bit of solipsism mixed into my philosophy
<br>
however, so in my case, it's the difference that makes all the difference.
<br>
I have a bit of an experiential bias towards reality.  I confess: I don't
<br>
really care about (or even, perhaps, believe in) external realities that
<br>
don't share a causal experiential chain with me.
<br>
<p><p>2. &quot;We build a form of uploading in which it can be definitively shown that
<br>
iterative destruction results.  Do you go for it anyway?&quot;
<br>
<p>No, damn it.  But I won't be happy about it.  (Sigh... at least it will be
<br>
'me' not being happy about it, as opposed to Jason #2 having the time of his
<br>
life.)
<br>
<p><p>3. &quot; Transporter beams?&quot;
<br>
<p>Nope, sorry.
<br>
<p><p>4. &quot;Don't you want to be like Captain Kirk, and see the universe and make
<br>
out with green chicks on strange planets?&quot;
<br>
<p>Doesn't everybody?
<br>
<p><p>5. &quot;Yer just being difficult, aren't you?&quot;
<br>
<p>I would never never never do that.  Never.  How dare you suggest such a
<br>
thing?  I'm shocked.
<br>
<p><p>6. &quot;Come, come, elucidate your thoughts.&quot;
<br>
<p>Watch it.
<br>
<p><p>7. &quot;If you do upload, don't you want to make back-up copies of yourself?&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes I do.  But it's not going to be as simple as having the contents of my
<br>
hard drive on a DVD somewhere.  I imagine an uploaded system with lots of
<br>
redundancies, capable of recovering from widespread damage on the fly with
<br>
nearly instantaneously mirrored processes and data.  However, there would be
<br>
an amount of damage that would be unacceptable-- a point at which the
<br>
intelligence &quot;goes away.&quot;  That would be a bad thing.
<br>
<p><p>8.  &quot;Can't you see all the ways in which this is a limiting belief?&quot;
<br>
<p>Functionally, I appreciate the problem.  But, again, can't -you- see why
<br>
it's the difference that makes all the difference?  This belief doesn't
<br>
limit myself, it limits the prospects of the next iteration (which, I admit,
<br>
might not be a very nice thing to do.  I apologize in advance for any harm I
<br>
may be inflicting on my future iterations-- but if you guys just hold out
<br>
long enough, I might change my mind!)
<br>
<p><p>9.  &quot;Are you done yet?&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes, goodbye.

&gt; I think this approach frees us from an excessive focus on the particular
&gt; characteristics of our brains.  It lets us look more abstractly at the
&gt; nature of information and how it might be associated with consciousness
&gt; and identity.
