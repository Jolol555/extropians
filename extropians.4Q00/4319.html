<p>
A little while back, there was some discussion about whether it's yet
<br>
technically feasible to remove ovarian tissue (perhaps from a woman about
<br>
to undergo inadvertently sterilizing radiation treatment for cancer),
<br>
freeze it, and later reimplant it--perhaps many years later. Drawing as
<br>
usual upon only the most authoritative medical sources of information, I
<br>
report that the BBC TV series SUPERHUMAN, hosted by Lord Robert Winston,
<br>
mentioned that one Margaret Lloyd-Hart, a bellydancer by profession, was
<br>
the first to trial this method in Feb 1999. Seven months later she did
<br>
indeed produce an ovum, but the process was only sustained by a massive
<br>
dosage of hormones which made her feel so sick that she finally
<br>
discontinued treatment. I haven't yet followed up this clue with a net
<br>
search on subsequent attempts.
