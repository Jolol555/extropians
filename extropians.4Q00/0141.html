Eugene Leitl confessed,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not see how you can break out sustainably from Darwinian regime,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having to originate in it and being surrounded by it from all places,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including stuff emerging in your very own belly.
</em><br>
<p>Neither can anyone else. Looks like a job for Spiritual Machines, Robo sapiens,
<br>
Mind Children, and Artilects.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; This presumes the seed never ceases to be a monode during its growth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and stops growing after it has reached a certain spatial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dimension. (Of course, the chiefest objection is how you make that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seed to grow, and how do you keep it from going off in other places
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't want, while the thing is out of your hands). Since this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly limits its sphere of influence, it either keeps everybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tucked in, or has to make a remote clone of itself, creating a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population of SIs. By keeping it brittle, the clone never grows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; malign, and by design it never infringes on other sysop's domain.
</em><br>
<p>Wow! A population of SIs that never grows malign. Sounds like a friendly kind of
<br>
AI.
<br>

<br>
may assent to them, but it brings them out in the open. WHITEHEAD
