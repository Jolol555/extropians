Eugene writes, quoting Robin:
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; my model.  Specifically they are how fast resources available can grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; at an &quot;oasis&quot;, how much seeds cost as function of their speed and hardness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Resources growing at an oasis? The matterenergy concentration in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given solar system is constant. You can rearrange matter so that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximize available energy flux utilization, or even tinker with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate of matter to energy conversion. But the total resource
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentration is finite.
</em><br>
<p>I think Robin is referring here not to raw materials, but to processed
<br>
materials ready to be turned into finished product.  This feeds into
<br>
the question of how quickly the replicators could build new seeds and
<br>
launchers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; My model says that a selection effect at the leading edge selects for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; pioneers who do not stay.   So the big question is how strong this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Inoculate an infinite agar plate. Step back a couple of lightminutes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and wait until the front will arrive. Look just behind the wave. Are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you going to see sterile substrate after wave front? Fat chance.
</em><br>
<p>My feeling is that once the wave has passed you by, evolution is through
<br>
with you.  All the factors that got you here are irrelevant now.
<br>
It is very analogous to an organism which has lived past the age at
<br>
which it can reproduce.  Selection pressures no longer act to keep such
<br>
organisms alive, for exactly the same reason.
<br>
<p>In other words, if the fastest way to expand is to build fast in some
<br>
kind of catastrohic mode which will kill the organisms which stay behind,
<br>
that is what will evolve (eventually).  If the fastest way to expand
<br>
happens to leave organisms behind, then that is instead what will evolve.
<br>
<p>Selection/evolution plays no part in determining the fate of colonies
<br>
which have fallen behind the wave.  Their behavior is unselected-for.
<br>
There is no selection pressure to favor colonies which hold onto the
<br>
systems after launching seeds (once the frontier has become unreachable).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Staying is default. The launchers can't launch themselves, so they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stay. Sustainable barrage of stellar neighbours with seeds is a waste
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of resources after they're infected, so they'll cease.
</em><br>
<p>The behavior of the launchers after the frontier has become unreachable
<br>
has no effect on the rate of spread of the frontier, hence this kind of
<br>
reasoning cannot play a role in the selection of the fastest-spreading
<br>
replicators.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think one half of your assumptions is faulty: yes, the selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect is very strong, resulting in convergent evolution of expansion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wave front organisms and no, they do not leave sterile substrate in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their wake.
</em><br>
<p>Sterility is a possibility, but many other behaviors are possible as well.
<br>
