<p>You would, but I'm not aiming for early adoptors.  I'm aiming for the

mass market, which means aesthetics become part of the functionality:
<br>
they look wierd or are at all uncomfortable, and they're as good as
<br>
busted right off the manufacturing line.  You can hide a lot in a vest,
<br>
and make it look slick in many social environments.

<p>Yeah, but speed will be a problem and must be dealt with nonetheless.
