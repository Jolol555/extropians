<br>
<p><em>&gt; I still think you're over-estimating the good being done by ExI
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What might be a more realistic value then?  Sure, some $$$
<br>
spent will be worth more than other $$$ spent on getting us to the
<br>
singularity (and hence bringing immortal salvation to more), and given
<br>
the time value of money, surely in general, $$$ spent now are more
<br>
valuable than $$$ spent 10 or 20 years from now to the effort of
<br>
bringing eternal salvation to more people.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, some amount of money spent today on Exi, medical
<br>
research or whatever will more or less bring eternal salvation to one
<br>
more of our children.  Perhaps $0.01, or $1, or maybe $100?  Maybe
<br>
more for each immortal soul?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lets say spending $10,000 on ExI, on average enables one more
<br>
of our children to make it to eternal salvation.  Lets say spending
<br>
$10,000 on the Red Cross increases the average mortal life span of 100
<br>
people by 10 years (and lets assume this isn't, yet, enough to get any
<br>
of them to the singularity.)  Would you consider these to be
<br>
conservative numbers yet?  Even with this, which is the better buy?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I'd hope I'd be able to give up 10 years of my life if
<br>
it'd bring one more of my children eternal salvation.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I try to simply think, every $1 spent today might bring
<br>
immortality to one more of my children.  Perhaps this is a little to
<br>
optimistic, but by how much, do you think?  Even if it is, it still
<br>
helps me to overcome my selfishness and give a little more.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kind of feel like the Mormon church which tries to justify
<br>
their lack of aid to humanity, given the billions of $$$ they take in
<br>
every year.  They just built a billion $$$ conference center in
<br>
downtown SLC which is the largest (and likely the most expensive)
<br>
religious building of it's type anywhere.  They claim: why help a
<br>
person live a few more years of life, when you might be able to give
<br>
them eternal salvation by converting them and getting them baptized?
<br>
But then, this justification works for me and not for them, because
<br>
I'm right and their wrong right?;) If extropians are right, how many
<br>
people could the LDS church really bring eternal salvation to, given
<br>
such huge amount of resources, if they only really knew which was the
<br>
better buy????
