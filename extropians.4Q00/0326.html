<em>&gt; my own experience in the military. Truly brave men and women are truly rare, and
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Exercising restraint in the face of danger is actually more brave than just
<br>
blazing away. However, each has its place. I would not want a bunny lover in
<br>
command of a SEAL unit, for example. Elite combat unit members should be people
<br>
who have no compunctions about shooting who they are told to shoot, when they
<br>
are told to shoot them, with no compunctions or remorse. I would be worried
<br>
about having such a person in the White House, on the other hand. 80% of the
<br>
military, and 95% of the general population I would not trust to watch my back
<br>
in combat. The nuclear button is such an abstraction from actual killing that it
<br>
is rather a testament to how restrained most people are that they can be trusted
<br>
with the trigger. I am not worried about missile crews pushing the button, I am
<br>
worried about them NOT pushing the button when it is needed.
