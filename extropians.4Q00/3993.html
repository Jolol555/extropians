<p>This is pretty much how the standard RD-50 test works.  RD-50 stands 
<br>
for &quot;rat deaths - 50%&quot;  They figure out how high a dosage is required 
<br>
to kill 50% of rats.  This is the RD-50 limit.  If this limit is too 
<br>
close to the possible daily dosage, the substance is banned as being 
<br>
too easy to overdose or have side-effects.  They try to estimate how 
<br>
fast the substance is excreted to figure out how many times the daily 
<br>
dose can be tolerated.  A fat-soluble substance that stays in the 
<br>
body for 60 days must not kill 50% of the rats within 60x the daily 
<br>
dose.  A water-soluble substance that is excreted within 3 days must 
<br>
not kill 50% of the rats within 3x the daily dose.
<br>
<p>This gets a good average and a good estimate.  It is not so good for 
<br>
metabolisms that are not average.  It assumes that a slow 
<br>
accumulation of a certain dosage would be as bad as a single dose of 
<br>
that substance, and doesn't take an increased tolerance into account. 
<br>
It also doesn't allow for any type of screening to see if it can be 
<br>
limited to those who will not have toxic effects.  As a generic 
<br>
starting point, it may be a good test.
<br>
<p>Other problems are that humans sometimes react differently than rats. 
<br>
I like to point out the examples of vitamin B7, vitamin B8, vitamin 
<br>
B9, vitamin B10 and vitamin B11.  Never heard of them?  That's 
<br>
because it turns out that they a required in rats or pigeons which 
<br>
were the experimental animals, but they serve no known role in human 
<br>
nutrition.  All the animal experiments failed to apply to humans.

<p>This wouldn't apply, since these do not have human daily dosages. 
<br>
You aren't supposed to get zapped with electricity or hit with cars. 
<br>
Those deaths are accidental overdoses, not approved &quot;safe&quot; dosages. 
<br>
The fertilizers would be tested to see if the levels of residue might 
<br>
kill rats.  Banning substances, such as fertilizer, for environmental 
<br>
effects would be much harder to measure.

<p><em>&gt;I guess then that dihydrogen monoxide is now a banned substance.... its

<em>&gt;It tends to concentrate in cancer tumors, its the major component of

</em><br>
<p>I have seen this humorous position before.  Literally, however, H2O 
<br>
does not kill 50% of the rats until the forced dosage is many times 
<br>
the typical daily dosage, while its excretion rate is much less than 
<br>
one day.  Also note that cancer cells used to be normal human cells, 
<br>
thus, all human-required nutrients are found in cancer cells.
