<p><em>&gt;For a flexible ring, I think the problem is that if the orbit is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;slightly elliptical, as any true orbit will be, the particles of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ring want to move faster during the lower part of the orbit.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will compress the ring in some portions and stretch it elsewhere.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suspect that this energy transfer will cause the ring to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deformed and to collapse into the atmosphere eventually.
</em><br>
<p>More specifically: the energy loss causes the orbital decay. The
<br>
angular momentum loss changes the orbital eccentricity.
<br>
<p>Some words about a &quot;solid&quot; ring. We have in our history books and in
<br>
our observational databases a few hundred years of studies of one
<br>
example of a &quot;ring&quot;, that is, Saturn's rings. Much of the following
<br>
words came from a nice little book: _Rings: Discoveries from Galileo
<br>
to Voyager_ by James Elliot and Richard Kerr, Cambridge University
<br>
Press, 1984. Here is some history.
<br>
<p>The Dutch astronomer Christian Hugens observed Saturn in the
<br>
mid-1600s with the telescopes of the day, which had only been in use
<br>
for several decades. He discovered Titan, observed Saturn's rings
<br>
again and worked out orbital periods of objects around Saturn. He
<br>
was the first to hypothesize that Saturn had a &quot;thin flat ring,
<br>
nowhere touching, and inclined to the eliptic&quot;. Then soon later,
<br>
Jean Dominque Cassini announced in 1675 of the dark line that seemed
<br>
to divide the ring in two, raising questions among the physicists of
<br>
the day of how a solid ring could stand up under the strain of
<br>
rotating so close to Saturn, and Cassini's Division just confused
<br>
the issue more. Cassini thought that a swarm of small satellites
<br>
would give the appearance of solidity when viewed from so far away
<br>
as Earth, but would require no new dynamical explanations. Each
<br>
particle in the ring would orbit the planet just as the Moon orbited
<br>
Earth, Galileo's moons orbited Jupiter, and Titan orbited Saturn.
<br>
Cassini's division would make no difference at all. So then towards
<br>
the end of the 1600s, the concept of particulate rings gained favor.
<br>
<p>Then science took a step backward, when William Herschel, in the
<br>
1700s pronounced the ring to be solid. He resisted the division of
<br>
his solid ring by Cassini's division, preferring to see it as a
<br>
marking of only one side of the ring. Herschel had some support
<br>
about his solid ring through Pierre Simon de Laplace.
<br>
<p>The rings, to Laplace, represented an arrested, petrified stage in
<br>
his nebular formation of the solar system, during which the ball of
<br>
material that would become Saturn was &quot;shedding rings&quot; that would
<br>
coalesce into solid satellites. The present rings of Saturn,
<br>
according to Laplace, never broke up to form satellites, but
<br>
solidified as they were, forming many solid rings. Unlike Herschel,
<br>
he found that a single ring, or even two rings to be impossibly unstable-
<br>
only at a single across the width of a rotating ring would the
<br>
outward push of centrifugal force balance the inward pull of
<br>
gravity. The imbalance of forces elsewhere on a wide ring would tear
<br>
it apart, no matter how thick it was, Laplace said. His solution was
<br>
to subdivide the two known rings (divided by Cassini's division),
<br>
into a myriad of narrow rings nested inside one another, thus
<br>
reducing the strain across any one ring. By concentrating the mass
<br>
of each ring off center, he further reduced the strain. He actually
<br>
made a ring behave as much like an orbiting particle as possible,
<br>
while remaining a solid ring. This is how things stood with regards
<br>
to the physical perception of Saturn's rings, for the next 50 years.
<br>
<p>Observations in the 1800s found a bewildering array of ringlets.
<br>
However a few scientists during the next 50 years were unconvinced
<br>
on the concept of solid rings. George Bond in 1850, from the seeming
<br>
mutability of Saturn's rings, proposed that the rings must not be
<br>
solid or rigid, but somehow fluid. He reevaluated Laplace's
<br>
calculation, and concluded the solid rings would not work.
<br>
<p>The concept of solid rings began to change then. The C ring was
<br>
discovered and observers noted that one could see the planet right
<br>
through the new ring, finally rejecting the idea of solid rings.
<br>
<p>James Clerk Maxwell won Cambridge University's Adams Prize in 1857
<br>
by demonstrating that Newtonian physics would not tolerate solid
<br>
rings, no matter how finely subdived. The irregularities demanded by
<br>
Laplace would be so huge as to be visible from Earth, Maxwell said,
<br>
even stabilized by such moutainous terrain, the slightest
<br>
disturbance would shatter the rings. Liquid rings, on the other
<br>
hand, would break up and form visible satellites. Maxwell reached
<br>
the &quot;new&quot; conclusion that &quot;the only system of rings which can exist
<br>
is one composed of an indefinite number of unconnected particles
<br>
revolving around the planet with different velocities according to
<br>
their respective distances&quot;.  Maxwell actually was in error,
<br>
regarding the liquid rings concept, because they were physically
<br>
possible, but that error was not discovered for another 100 years.
<br>
<p>Hope this provides some insight.

<p>P.S. In 30 days, the spacecraft named after Cassini on the spacecraft's
<br>
journey toward Saturn flies by Jupiter in a close encounter. Both the
<br>
Galileo and Cassini spacecraft are now in  dual-spacecraft measurements
<br>
mode, observing the planet Jupiter.
