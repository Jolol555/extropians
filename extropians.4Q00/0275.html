<p><em> &gt; It is a small percentage of killers who are psychotic in ways that are

<p>Actually, a major fraction of it seems to be not just genetic,
<br>
probably frozen chance from earlier phases of morphogenesis/early
<br>
infancy. If your &quot;compassion circuit&quot; is knocked out, that's bad
<br>
news. If you see your kid start torturing small animals and pets for
<br>
no reason, watch out.

<br>
Yeah, essentially one has to screen for them, and isolate them from
<br>
the society, humanely, of course. (The old-testamentary type of
<br>
justice would demand to kill such people on the spot, as soon as they
<br>
manifest their pathological symptoms, but we're too civilized for
<br>
that).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; IMO the laws today treat children as property - making it difficult to 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; intervene in abuse situations. For purely selfish reasons (I'd like less 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; violent offenders and predators) I would prefer if children were NOT treated 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; as property but rather as human beings with rights.
