But, if you get rid of the programs people want, you ARE making them do things
<br>
your way. Not that's it's
<br>
&nbsp;likely you'll be able to get rid of something people want, though. That's more
<br>
what I was talking about than your specific
<br>
comments. If we get our way, others won't get theirs, there are more of them
<br>
than us, and so we have to take that into account.
<br>
Taking the rest of your comment into it, I think you and I are largely saying
<br>
the same thing, that we have to include subjects
<br>
and people who don't have all our goals, in order to get even some of them.

<p>From: Chris Russo &lt;<a href="mailto:extropy@russo.org?Subject=Re:%20Random%20comments%20on%20some%20late%20discussions.&In-Reply-To=&lt;852569AD.0057D128.00@notes.cbis.com&gt;">extropy@russo.org</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;&gt;And THIS is exactly why libertarians won't ever be a real force in American
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;politics. Almost universally every libertarian I know (including me, most of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;time) comes off as a self-righteous know-it-all, acting as though everyone
</em><br>
else
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is beneath them. We all seem to say &quot;If only they could see what we see,  but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;they're not bright enough, so we'll have to make them do it anyway.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;You might want to reread my argument.  You're woefully misstating it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I proposed nowhere &quot;to make them do it anyway.&quot;  To the contrary, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;talked about coincidental goals building a coalition of voters.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more cerebral voters will probably appreciate the strong logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;underlying everything, and the less cerebral will probably only be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;able to appreciate the shiny baubles that extend from that underlying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;logic.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm basically saying to not turn away those voters just because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't understand the bigger picture.  I'm also saying that if we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;waiting for a plurality to understand the bigger picture, we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doomed.
