Michael Lorrey:
<br>
<p>I'm with you there. I know I'm a law abiding citizen. I also typically am
<br>
armed.
<br>
I have nothing to fear legally from cops, so any action they take against me
<br>
is
<br>
by definition illegal action, and I am legally able (and justified) to
<br>
defend
<br>
myself against such *felonious* criminal actions by police. Any jurisdiction
<br>
which would treat me any differently is, by definition, a tyranny. Insisting
<br>
on
<br>
living under tyranny implies the acceptance of that tyranny, if the means
<br>
and
<br>
ability to leave that tyranny exist. If you fear such tyranny, vote with
<br>
your
<br>
feet. If you don't, its like not voting: you don't get to complain.
<br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
So what state do you live in?  Presumably one where concealed carry licenses
<br>
aren't nearly impossible to get as they are in California.  Vermont is the
<br>
only state that seems to have reasonable respect for 2nd amendment.  Even
<br>
then a lot of cops are so trigger happy they would probably shoot you if you
<br>
had a gun at all on you.  It is getting that stupidly violent out there.
<br>
When the Feds can pull things like Waco, Ruby Ridge, decades of IRS
<br>
bullying, DEA and other confiscations, no-knock laws and so on the citizenry
<br>
has every reason to fear and distrust their government.
<br>
<p>But you always get to complain for the simple reason that you have rights
<br>
that are being violated.  There is no country on the face of this earth that
<br>
fully respects individual rights.  There is no where to go to.  So you
<br>
either complain or go into full armed revolt and get shot in nothing flat.
<br>
You can go underground or as free as you can within the best context you
<br>
can.   Beyond that complain like hell and try to educate as many people as
<br>
possible.
