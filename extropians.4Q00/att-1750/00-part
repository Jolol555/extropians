Okay, here is Max's response to Perry's post which was on local lists and
not on the main list.  Since it's now on the main list, I thought
forwarding this post (with Max's permission) would be helpful.

Hi Perry,


I can understand how you might be under that impression, but I have to
say that extropians are defined by the Extropian Principles and that says
nothing about libertarianism. Of course, many extropians describe
themselves that way, but the principles are broader and don't commit
anyone to such a specific political view. Please see:

attitudes towards personal responsibility, self-direction, and so on, are
highly compatible with a desire to learn all kinds of self-defense
skills.
