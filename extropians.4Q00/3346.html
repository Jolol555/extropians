Money IS information, or rather, money is a representation of an abstract form
<br>
of information, called value. Money isn't just green paper or coins, it's a
<br>
physical object carrying information. I don't know that information exists in a
<br>
pure form, since the only way it can be used (or held) is in some form of
<br>
physical representation (even thoughts are chemical and physical reactions)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been following this thread, because I like the idea of the free-flow
<br>
of information, but I don't know that it's possible. Since what you're talking
<br>
about always has a physical representation, someone is going to own it. Unlike
<br>
other things (in general) giving away information doesn't deprive you of it, but
<br>
it does deprive you of whatever you used to transport it from your mind to
<br>
theirs, excepting speech not sold. Even that deprives you of the amount of time
<br>
it took you to tell the person (time again being an abstraction of information)

<p>I did not make a simplistic association.  I do not speak a vague
<br>
generality.  I am speaking of information and only of information, not
<br>
of money.  Please keep on topic.
