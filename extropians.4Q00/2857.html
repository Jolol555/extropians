Hi Steve.
<br>
<p><p>On reading your replies, I am increasingly struck by the sensation that you
<br>
are having some sort of imaginary argument.  Evidence of this is to be found
<br>
in the mysterious spontaneous arguments you continue to construct on my
<br>
behalf (and yours.)  Let's take a look and see:
<br>
<p>----- Original Message -----
<br>
From: &quot;Steve&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:steve@multisell.com?Subject=Re:%20Conscious%20machines&In-Reply-To=&lt;00cb01c0558e$70088f20$d2147318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">steve@multisell.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Can we agree that even in the absence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;purely predictable/deterministic properties, we, as cognizant beings, can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;proceed anyway, and musn't be paralyzed with indecision?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed, but nor should we be too rash ... I am arguing for balance, not
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; one side or the other on this empowerment question....
</em><br>
<p>Did I miss something?  When did you heretofore argue for balance?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;The point remains: we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;try to remove the genuinely limiting ideologies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but this point is so banal and obvious, we all do it anyway. The
</em><br>
devil
<br>
<em>&gt; is in the detail.
</em><br>
<p>I absolutely agree that the point is banal and obvious.  You're debating
<br>
some sort of mythological argument I never actually made.  I'm not really
<br>
saying very much.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;The point remains:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IF
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;an ideology limits an individual from increasing utility, THEN it should
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;stripped away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Read that sentence again, carefully.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You do love to generalise ... I am trying to inject some gritty reality
</em><br>
into
<br>
<em>&gt; your speculations because I hate generalisations, particularly in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>Dude, you gotta start somewhere.  You might prefer bottom/up, but why don't
<br>
you form some good arguments as to why top/down is bad?  You're introduction
<br>
of &quot;
<br>
gritty reality&quot; is an attack on specifics and I'm just trying to say: the
<br>
above is a valid generalization!  Who are you arguing against?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think a better way of evaluating ideological propositions might be on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TRUTH value .... utility is an even more nebulous quantity, and my utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be to your detriment.
</em><br>
<p>Uh, *I* said -everyone's- utility (but we can't be sure that you're actually
<br>
having this conversation with me.)  If you think truth is a more important
<br>
goal than utility, make an argument for it.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I repeat, reject ideology because is false, not on grounds that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limiting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True beliefs, such as that I am not superman or batman, are limiting, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work.
</em><br>
<p>Are you purposefully missing my use of the term 'limiting?'  I thought I had
<br>
made it clear that my usage is in reference to limiting utility.  Are you
<br>
aware that I proffered that clarification in my last post?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; You are generalising from the particular in the same way that an
</em><br>
evangelical
<br>
<em>&gt; Christian gives their testimony .... Hallelujah, I have been saved, accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same can happen for you ....
</em><br>
<p>You interpreted my comments as an evangelical exhortation?  Wow, I'm
<br>
impressed.  This person you're arguing against must be saying some pretty
<br>
radical stuff.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Great, it works for you (or you have convinced yourself that it does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by auto-suggestion, same thing) and you wish to share this &quot;revelation&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Revelation?  I thought we agreed that it was banal and obvious.  Which is
<br>
it?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Problem is, your formulae contains nothing new, is  just an naive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exhortation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to &quot;optimise.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  So what formula are you talking about?  What is the 'it' to which
<br>
you refer above?  Did you interpret my list of four points as a diatribe on
<br>
the detailed means by which one could successfully empower themselves?
<br>
Curious, I had intended to make a few general and obvious comments.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;NLP is a huge system about remodelling &amp; changing your
<br>
<em>&gt; meta-programming, getting rid of outworn habitual behaviour &amp;c. What are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you saying that adds to this?
</em><br>
<p>Nothing at all.  Strangely, I don't really have an agenda.  Or a formula.
<br>
As I thought I'd made clear, for me it was simply making a decision.
<br>
Simple, small, naive, banal, obvious-- all of those things.  I'm not talking
<br>
about some sort of rapturous transformation here.  I have a very general
<br>
intention: observe, improve.  You seem to want to make my comments bigger
<br>
than they are so you have something to rail against.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Glad that I am continually forcing you to modify and qualify your
</em><br>
position.
<br>
<p>Actually, you're not Steve.  My position is the same.  What you've done is
<br>
forced me to explain to you in aching detail what I meant by my very general
<br>
comments.  That's just because, in search of an argument, you've engaged in
<br>
semantic game-play over my use of the term 'limiting.'  For most, the phrase
<br>
&quot;strip away limiting ideological garbage,&quot; is self-evident.  (And very
<br>
small, and banal, etc, etc, etc.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;What is a human?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of your so-called limiting belief structures .....
</em><br>
<p>You saying that doesn't make it so.  Let me make my question more clear: to
<br>
what do we refer when we use the word: &quot;humans.&quot;  How is the word &quot;human&quot; a
<br>
belief?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;What is it about -you- that makes you &quot;not-a-human?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have stripped away this limiting belief. Ha!
</em><br>
<p>But, I thought you weren't interesting in stripping away limiting beliefs...
<br>
just false ones.  Is your belief that you are not human a 'truer' belief?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not a problem I have. I just don't altogether trust everyone else with
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Ah, I see.  You don't trust other people who might empower themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;enough.  So what's your strategy then?  Is it your intention to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;other individuals from embracing rational self-empowerment?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, just to try and present them with fuller information so as to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a more informed choice. Shame that you refuse to comprehend MVT, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is no loss to me ....
</em><br>
<p>Who said I refuse to comprehend MVT?  I haven't even thought about it...
<br>
we're a far cry away from me forming the deliberate intention to
<br>
NOT-comprehend it.  Are you sure you aren't having a parallel conversation
<br>
with someone else?
<br>
<p>Also, you just said you don't trust everyone with personal empowerment.  Now
<br>
you say you want to: &quot;present them with fuller information so as to make a
<br>
more informed choice.&quot;  How do you reconcile these apparently contradictory
<br>
statements?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;More likely its fear-- and the longer that Joe perpetuates this belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;structure, the less likely that he'll actually sit down and do something:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;write his book, say hello to someone nice.  If he's lucky, he'll get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knocked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;out of this negative attractor state by a major situational modifier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you attempting to use psychobabble jargon to enhance your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own authority here?
</em><br>
<p>Uh, I dunno.  Is that what it looks like to you?  If so, I retract all
<br>
statements that appear to be a contrivance designed to demonstrate
<br>
authoritative knowledge of human psychology.  I don't have any such
<br>
knowledge.  All I know is that some people are limited by fear.  Some people
<br>
get stuck in negative attractor states.  Sometimes, big things happen that
<br>
get people out of negative attractor states.  Have I said something
<br>
controversial or un-intuitive here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;For instance, I'm totally incapable of recognizing how your above
</em><br>
paragraph
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;invalidates (or even remotely addresses) my statement that: &quot;Environments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;have decreased relevancy to our existence if we don't actually get to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;mentally interface&quot; with them.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Mentally interface&quot; presumably means &quot;think about them.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>How have you drawn this presumption?  You have been following -this-
<br>
discussion, right?  If so, you're aware that &quot;mentally interface&quot; are terms
<br>
you introduced and I made use of as a means to describe how we interact with
<br>
reality.  If you want mentally interface to mean something else, then it's
<br>
not what we're talking about.
<br>
<p>We have
<br>
<em>&gt; infinite-state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capability so can think about, or imagine, any environments we want. Cite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Leibnitz &quot;all possible worlds.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Can we imagine environments we don't want?  Does the ability to imagine any
<br>
environments we want = ALL possible environments?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In fact, to my painfully addled intellect, your above paragraph appears
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be an attempt at tangential obfuscation by authority-- and seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;demonstrate an unwillingness to agree with (or engage) a relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;innocuous statement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What makes you say only &quot;relatively&quot; innocuous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What potential dangers do you see?
</em><br>
<p>Dunno.  Added the word relatively reflexively.  I don't actually see any
<br>
dangers, frankly.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; See points I made previously. You cannot deny that our brains are (1) E-1,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2) are self-organising, or (3) are infinite-state (as opposed to mu- or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finite-state.
</em><br>
<p>I don't deny these things, I just utterly fail to see their relevance to the
<br>
statements I made.  How does this conversation keep getting blown up into
<br>
evangelical proportions?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; MVT is based on scientifically repeatable experiments and observations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from nature. Your &quot;theory&quot; is just a personalised lingoistic
</em><br>
generalisation.
<br>
<p>What theory?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; MVT does explain the mechanisms of all mentation, including dreams.
</em><br>
<p>That's nice.  So... -you're- the one with the theory, right?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; But, as pro-science Extropians and what-not, we automatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are proposing a future radically at odds with the Amish vision ....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and therefore must be able to make a strong case for advancement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than comfortable stasis (along with its limiting, religious
</em><br>
beliefs).
<br>
<p>I thought you weren't interested in removing limiting beliefs, just false
<br>
ones?  Is it 'false' for the Amish to believe that a simpler life will make
<br>
them happy?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There are various depths of trance .. from wakefulness, through daydreams,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to deep catatonic somnambulism. But, yes, all mentation is &quot;hallucination&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if fairly mundane such as the hallucination of our internal voice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (thought).
</em><br>
<p>Why is &quot;hallucination&quot; a useful concept here?  What is the alternative?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; MVT explains this (naturally, I would say that,but happens to be the
</em><br>
case).
<br>
<p>Why did we even start talking about MVT?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; let me ask you a question ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can use MVT to devise new types of hypnotic induction (mind control).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Should I use these techniques to promote my own agenda or not?
</em><br>
<p>...oh yeah, you wanted to talk about using it to control people's minds...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Sure, I will be very beneficent, and put them in a &quot;better&quot; state of mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More people will be happier, therefore you think I should do it?
</em><br>
<p>If more utility results (and this is debatable,) then, yes, you should do
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;So, if you're asking, do I agree with ALL forms of personal empowerment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my answer is a definitive no.  I'm a big fan of lots of them, however.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aha, so you are building qualifiers into your initial statement.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I'm only doing so to appease your need for semantic nit-picking.  In
<br>
real life, I don't need to go around saying things like: &quot;I love ice-cream!
<br>
Except for stuff that's been sitting out for 6 weeks, turned brown, and
<br>
begun to emit a foul stench.&quot;  With you it's like: &quot;I'm in favor of personal
<br>
empowerment!  Except the kind of empowerment where someone uses their
<br>
god-like mental powers to turn the rest of us into mindless zombies.&quot;
<br>
It's silly.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; By the way, MVT is the way to make conscious machines , so I changed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the thread name again .. sorry for any confusion.
</em><br>
<p>Dude, -what- agenda are you pursuing here?  And how did -I- end up being
<br>
your guinea pig?  MVT is the way to make conscious machines, so that's the
<br>
thread name now?  Hang on a second... are you turning me into a mindless
<br>
zombie?
<br>
<p>How did this thread end up in a discussion of your theories on mind-control,
<br>
hallucinatory mentation or conscious machines?
<br>
<p>It seems you've seized on my innocuous comments as a possible platform for
<br>
the expression of some of your ideas.  I have no objection to the expression
<br>
of your ideas, but dude, you've re-invented my comments into some sort of
<br>
comprehensive evangelical personal empowerment theory as a potential
<br>
adversary for your own constructs-- and... well, I'm not particularly
<br>
interested in playing that role.
<br>
<p>Let's take my simplistic comments at face value: the basic exhortation to
<br>
optimize (as un-useful as that may be,) and leave me out of the rest of
<br>
this... uh... -stuff.-
<br>
<p>(I am fully cognizant of the fact that while clear reckoning and simple
<br>
determination was effective in my case, your mileage may vary.)
<br>
<p>Thanks.
