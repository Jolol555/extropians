Holding all primaries on the same day gives the advantage to the incumbent
<br>
and/or whoever has the most money. Holding early primaries in small states
<br>
allows a less affluent candidate to gain exposure and credibility (and thus the
<br>
increased ability to raise funds for more expensive large states). McCain did
<br>
well here in NH, and gave him enough exposure for the people to learn why he is
<br>
more than what his handlers and the media said he was: he has a mean streak,
<br>
holds grudges, has few friends among his co-workers, and is willing to spout the
<br>
accepted government line on the 2nd amendment in order to get 'soccer mom'
<br>
votes, contrary to his claims. If there had not been a long period of exposure
<br>
for McCain between NH/Iowa and Super Tuesday, most people would not have found
<br>
this out. Additionally, if the primaries were not open primaries (i.e. people
<br>
could cross party lines to vote in a primary), then 3rd party candidates would
<br>
have better showing. Primaries are not to select popular candidates among the
<br>
population, but popular candidates among party membership. If you insist on
<br>
being an independent, then you shouldn't get to select which nominated candidate
<br>
you get from each party. Thats what the write-in candidate is for.

<em>&gt; Okay, I'm zeroing in on another big problem here, the primary
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The big problem here is not only when the primaries are held, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fact that individual states have different rules. John McCain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got knocked out by the &quot;Super Tuesday&quot;  winner-take-all vote in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; California.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another problem is people cross-voting in the primary, trying to
