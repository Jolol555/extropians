<em>&gt; This is *doctors* dealing with *yes/no* boxes.   What amazes me about the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I agree.  I do human interface as a hobby.  I am hearing more and more ways
<br>
that people screwed up the Palm Beach ballot.  I never dreamed there could
<br>
be that many ways to do it wrong!  Here are some ways I have heard.  I
<br>
couldn't think these up by myself if I tried!
<br>
<p>- punch second hole to choose second candidate listed (Buchanan vote)
<br>
- count down to the fifth hole to punch it instead of punching the hole
<br>
numbered 5
<br>
- punch first button to choose &quot;incumbent&quot; vice-president (when Florida law
<br>
declares neither candidate incumbent as President, so first button goes to
<br>
our incumbent Governor's party!)
<br>
- punch next to Gore's name instead of near the arrow (Buchanan vote)
<br>
- punch next to BOTH Gore and Leiberman's names (two punches)
<br>
- punch both boxes that appear to be within the democratic square (two
<br>
punches)
<br>
- punch the box near the word DEMOCRATIC to choose the democratic nominee
<br>
(Buchanan vote)
<br>
- punch the box near the word DEMOCRATIC to choose a straight democratic
<br>
ticket (Buchanan vote)
<br>
- punch two candidates accidentally and write in which one you really meant
<br>
- don't punch either and write in the one you want
<br>
- don't put card all the way into holepunch, so it punches wrong holes
<br>
- lay card flat on desk, look at it from an angle, see raised holepunch
<br>
device as being one hole higher than it really is
<br>
- punch wrong candidate, figure it out, and punch right one (two punches)
<br>
- punch a second time thinking it undoes your selection, and then choosing
<br>
right on (two punches)
<br>
- rest your hand on the puncher when not punching, and making depressions
<br>
that the computer reads as double punches when really only one hole is
<br>
punched
<br>
- punch hole half-way so cut-out hole is hanging by a thread and is read by
<br>
the computer as still being unpunched
<br>
- fold or twist ballot to try to read arrows and make it unscannable by the
<br>
computer due to wrinkles
<br>
- put cut-out hole back in to cover the hole you didn't want
<br>
- put all cards in hole punch at the same time, so votes are punched through
<br>
all pages
<br>
- have arthritis so you can't push the punch all the way through
<br>
- hit punch so hard that it bounces to a new hole and punches wrong place
<br>
- hit punch so hard that the paper slips and misaligns subsequent punches
<br>
- put holepunch over card from bottom instead of top, so holes don't line up
<br>
where expected
<br>
- ask for new ballot, and then place old one on top to punch same holes to
<br>
new ballot
<br>
