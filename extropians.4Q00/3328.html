</em><br>
<p>I did not make a simplistic association.  I do not speak a vague
<br>
generality.  I am speaking of information and only of information, not
<br>
of money.  Please keep on topic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Laws of scarcity.  Maybe you think it would be nice if every kid on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; planet could have a mint copy of Action Comics #1, but you can't argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; such a distribution wouldn't destroy an interesting market.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Irrelevant to the discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only if you haven't been paying attention, or are unaware of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transformation of creative energy into replicable data prevalent in today's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media environment.  If 'collectibility' is an asset worth protecting in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material world, why isn't it in the electronic one?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Irrelevant because there is one and only one of those actual physical
<br>
items.  I am not speaking of actual physical items but of information,
<br>
of bits.  That is the difference as I pointed out in my previous post. 
<br>
Dragging an actual physical item in to make your point is a mistake.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;   A first edition is a material artifact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is not information but a given physical embodiment in a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; form produced at a particular time.  It cannot be duplicated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; definition.  But every kid can have a copy of the contents of that first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; edition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes Samantha, and think very carefully about what that &quot;definition&quot; is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I did.  Do you have something to add?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Here, allow me: we have arbitrarily placed value upon a particular edition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a magazine.  Although the technology exists to create a nearly exact (for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all practical intents and purposes) duplicate, we have passed laws against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any attempt to pass such a forgery off as a first edition.  Essentially we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have decided to outlaw the replication of a particular print run of material
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goods, despite the fact that we could easily put an accurate forgery in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand of every elementary school kid on the planet.  We do that to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (arbitrarily) protect a market-- and as a result, there is one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This does not work.  A duplicate is a duplicate and in the world of
<br>
collectibles can never be worth what the original is.  Again, please get
<br>
out of examples that have nothing to do with what I am talking about.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes there is a place for secrets - in war or the equivalent, one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; personal information and affairs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's not the position of the post to which I replied:  Zero Powers wrote:

<em>&gt; &quot;I personally think those who demand the perpetuation of personal &quot;privacy&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a future that will live and breath on the unrestricted communication and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing of ever increasing amounts of information are unknowing Luddites.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I see it our ultimate &quot;purpose,&quot; if there is one, is to facillitate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient storage, transmission and processing of data.  Everything at its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; core is information and the more of it we can grasp and utilize, the better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off we will be.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   But in peace and in non-personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information, the maximal power and good of each of us is highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dependent on the free flow of information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, total disagreement.  It's not just about free flow of information,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (isn't that obvious?) it's about access to the right information.  Further,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you specifically use the term 'each of us' referring to individuals: can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think of a few (thousand) ways in which the maximal power and good of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual is highly dependent on the controlled flow of information?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We are speaking at cross purposes.  I suggest we both take a breather
<br>
and reset.
