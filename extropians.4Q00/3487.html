Emlyn, &lt;<a href="mailto:emlyn@one.net.au?Subject=Re:%20Correction%20Re:%20Foreseeing%20the%20Web,%20was%20Re:%20CONFESSIONS%20OF%20A%20CHEERFULLIBERTARIAN%20By%20%20%20David%20Brin&In-Reply-To=&lt;200012071749.JAA08442@finney.org&gt;">emlyn@one.net.au</a>&gt;, writes:

<em>&gt; I've read Berner-Lee saying that he never intended hand-coding of HTML, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the first web-related application was a primitive WYZIWYG html editor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he built himself.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I think both of these are right.  His original idea was that
<br>
people would not write HTML manually, but rather that what we know as
<br>
web browsers would have built-in authoring/editing facilities.  He wrote
<br>
a system like this using Objective C (an early object oriented C) on the
<br>
Next workstation.  Later a company called Navisoft here in Santa Barbara
<br>
produced a similar product for PCs, but they got acquired by AOL which
<br>
eventually killed it.  (Several of my friends managed to retire at 30
<br>
with fortunes in AOL stock options though.)
<br>
<p>However XML is intended to maintain the simplicity, readability and,
<br>
indeed, writability of HTML.  And I note that one of the requirements
<br>
for XLinks is that they are human readable, which probably implies
<br>
human writable.  So I think he has come around on this issue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The goals of machine readability, etc, etc, of XML are laudable. How long do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you reckon they'll last in the face of big commercial interests &amp; a zillion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (well, many million) users of various flavours, with their own ideas about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how they want to use this thing called the web?
</em><br>
<p>Fragmentation is always a danger, but weighed against this is the
<br>
advantage of standardization.  And of course XML is &quot;eXtensible&quot; so the
<br>
hope is that people can customize it to the degree they desire while
<br>
staying within the overall framework of compatibility.
<br>
<p>The idea of the Semantic Web is that people, and especially machines,
<br>
are seeking information.  Data, in this model, should be expressed in
<br>
&quot;declarative&quot; form.  That is, the web pages should say what the data is,
<br>
what it means, what its relationships are, and not try to express what
<br>
you should do with it.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2000/12/xml2000/timbl.html">http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2000/12/xml2000/timbl.html</a> describes a talk
<br>
by Berners-Lee in which he lays out his ideas a little more clearly.
<br>
Above the basic declarative data layer he projects higher layers
<br>
which support logical connectives, so that you could combine data from
<br>
different sources and draw logical inferences in a quantitative way.
<br>
These higher layers are pretty speculative, almost approaching the AI
<br>
on the web concepts like www.webmind.com.
<br>
<p>But the basic techniques of using XML for the raw data and style sheets to
<br>
&quot;prettify&quot; it for human consumption are already implemented by the newest
<br>
browsers.  This should work well for B2B collaborations or any situation
<br>
where you want to promote automated reading of your published data.
<br>
I think it's likely to succeed.
<br>
