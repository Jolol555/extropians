</em><br>
<p>A good and interesting point.  One thing that seems less than certain to
<br>
me concerning future AIs and learning is the notion that they will be
<br>
almost totally able to share learned knowledge with one another
<br>
relatively fully and instantaneously.  But if the AI has a lot of its
<br>
mentality modeled along the lines of neural nets (or the equivalent)
<br>
then its learning is likely to be a matter of a huge number of
<br>
interconnnections being made in its neural matrix including connections
<br>
intertwined with what it already knew and the individual being it is. 
<br>
This may first of all be not much faster to acquire in subjective time
<br>
than it is for a human when learning a difficult subject.  And once
<br>
learned it may be no easier to extract the learned knowledge cleanly
<br>
than in the case of a human because that net of information is quite
<br>
entangled with other things that have little to do with the subject
<br>
except to that particular individual.  Assuming it can be more or less
<br>
disentangled I would doubt the result is anywhere near as rich or that
<br>
it would give the same overall depth of knowledge and experience of the
<br>
subject to a recipient of the knowledge.  And that recipient would have
<br>
to go through yet another process of integrating the information.  
<br>
Perhaps this is an argument for not using things that resemble such
<br>
networks for general knowledge acquisition and association.
