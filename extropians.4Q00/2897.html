<p>Hi Steve.

<p><em>&gt; &gt;Can we agree that even in the absence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;purely predictable/deterministic properties, we, as cognizant beings, can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;proceed anyway, and musn't be paralyzed with indecision?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed, but nor should we be too rash ... I am arguing for balance, not
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; one side or the other on this empowerment question....
</em><br>
<p>Did I miss something?  When did you heretofore argue for balance?
<br>
<p>I have never said I am against empowerment, only urged caution, and
<br>
asfar as I am aware have always argued for balance.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;The point remains: we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;try to remove the genuinely limiting ideologies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but this point is so banal and obvious, we all do it anyway. The
</em><br>
devil
<br>
<em>&gt; is in the detail.
</em><br>
<p>I absolutely agree that the point is banal and obvious.  You're debating
<br>
some sort of mythological argument I never actually made.  I'm not really
<br>
saying very much.
<br>
<p>It is an important topic, and I just wanted to tease more out of it ... am
<br>
not really attacking you, or trying to put words in your mouth, just
<br>
examining
<br>
the statements rather more closely than you might like.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think a better way of evaluating ideological propositions might be on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TRUTH value .... utility is an even more nebulous quantity, and my utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be to your detriment.
</em><br>
<p>Uh, *I* said -everyone's- utility (but we can't be sure that you're actually
<br>
having this conversation with me.)
<br>
<p>So what are all these postings .. do you deny their existence?
<br>
<p>If you think truth is a more important
<br>
goal than utility, make an argument for it.
<br>
<p>I thought that is what I have done ... no point in labouring it
<br>
too much, it is fairly clear that truth is the better yardstick.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I repeat, reject ideology because is false, not on grounds that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limiting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True beliefs, such as that I am not superman or batman, are limiting, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work.
</em><br>
<p>Are you purposefully missing my use of the term 'limiting?'  I thought I had
<br>
made it clear that my usage is in reference to limiting utility.  Are you
<br>
aware that I proffered that clarification in my last post?
<br>
<p>What I want to point out is we have to test where the boundaries/ limits are
<br>
by staying within them, since mistakes and overstepping might be
<br>
irreversible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are generalising from the particular in the same way that an
</em><br>
evangelical
<br>
<em>&gt; Christian gives their testimony .... Hallelujah, I have been saved, accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same can happen for you ....
</em><br>
<p>You interpreted my comments as an evangelical exhortation?  Wow, I'm
<br>
impressed.  This person you're arguing against must be saying some pretty
<br>
radical stuff.
<br>
<p>This is the impression you gave, about all the fantastic changes in your
<br>
life &amp;c.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Great, it works for you (or you have convinced yourself that it does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by auto-suggestion, same thing) and you wish to share this &quot;revelation&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Revelation?  I thought we agreed that it was banal and obvious.  Which is
<br>
it?
<br>
<p>Banal &amp; obvious .... I was trying to be ironic!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Problem is, your formulae contains nothing new, is  just an naive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exhortation  to &quot;optimise.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  So what formula are you talking about?  What is the 'it' to which
<br>
you refer above?  Did you interpret my list of four points as a diatribe on
<br>
the detailed means by which one could successfully empower themselves?
<br>
<p>I just wondered how serious you were.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Curious, I had intended to make a few general and obvious comments.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; NLP is a huge system about remodelling &amp; changing your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta-programming, getting rid of outworn habitual behaviour &amp;c. What are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you saying that adds to this?
</em><br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;What is a human?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of your so-called limiting belief structures .....
</em><br>
<p>You saying that doesn't make it so.  Let me make my question more clear: to
<br>
what do we refer when we use the word: &quot;humans.&quot;  How is the word &quot;human&quot; a
<br>
belief?
<br>
<p>It is a statement of identity with lot of ideological baggage.
<br>
I prefer the neutral &quot;humanoid.&quot; &quot;Human&quot; is a belief in the same way
<br>
that &quot;posthuman&quot; or &quot;extropian&quot; are beliefs/aims/ideology. Its just
<br>
that &quot;human&quot; is more entrenched in the culture, so seems less conjectural.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;What is it about -you- that makes you &quot;not-a-human?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have stripped away this limiting belief. Ha!
</em><br>
<p>But, I thought you weren't interesting in stripping away limiting beliefs...
<br>
just false ones.  Is your belief that you are not human a 'truer' belief?
<br>
<p>Again, this is my attempt to be ironic at your expense. What I basically
<br>
think is that &quot;I&quot; am the authority on my own identity, rather than any
<br>
outside observer ... but there is also I feel that the statement is true and
<br>
that &quot;human&quot; condition/ weakness/ identity is a limiting belief ... and is
<br>
one that can be &quot;stripped away&quot; or at least &quot;seen through&quot;.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, just to try and present them with fuller information so as to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a more informed choice. Shame that you refuse to comprehend MVT, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is no loss to me ....
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Who said I refuse to comprehend MVT?  I haven't even thought about it...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we're a far cry away from me forming the deliberate intention to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;NOT-comprehend it.  Are you sure you aren't having a parallel conversation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with someone else?
</em><br>
<p>Your exact phrase was &quot;gobbledegook&quot; ..... so either you have made an effort
<br>
to comprehend, and rejected it for some rationale or other ... or you are
<br>
genuinely unable to understand what it is ... if this is the case I might be
<br>
at
<br>
fault for use clumsy or difficult language.
<br>
<p>I feel it is important enough, in either case, for me to at least make MVT
<br>
more explicit so as to devalue &amp; argue against your &quot;gobbledegook&quot;
<br>
insult. If that means destroying the credibility of your own banal and
<br>
empty proposition, so be it. I am an unashamed reductionist philosopher
<br>
and MVT represents a powerful means of empowerment not just for me, but
<br>
for anyone else who cares to apply its findings.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Also, you just said you don't trust everyone with personal empowerment.
</em><br>
Now
<br>
<em>&gt;you say you want to: &quot;present them with fuller information so as to make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more informed choice.&quot;  How do you reconcile these apparently contradictory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statements?
</em><br>
<p>The fuller information process does impose a delay, so eliminates certain
<br>
rash implementation. Also we should think how our actions affects the world
<br>
&quot;in the round&quot; rather than just the first, selfish, greedy notion that
<br>
strikes us.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;out of this negative attractor state by a major situational modifier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you attempting to use psychobabble jargon to enhance your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own authority here?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Uh, I dunno.  Is that what it looks like to you?  If so, I retract all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statements that appear to be a contrivance designed to demonstrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;authoritative knowledge of human psychology.  I don't have any such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>We all have loads of knowledge of psychology ... don't be bamboozled
<br>
by ivory tower academics and qualified psychologists ..  hopefully  this
<br>
conversation (even putting aside MVT) might empower you a bit!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;All I know is that some people are limited by fear.  Some people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get stuck in negative attractor states.  Sometimes, big things happen that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get people out of negative attractor states.  Have I said something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;controversial or un-intuitive here?
</em><br>
<p>No, I agree with the fear thing ... it can become chronic, and I treat lots
<br>
of different phobias professionally ... some are really weird.
<br>
<p><p>We have &gt; infinite-state
<br>
<em>&gt; capability so can think about, or imagine, any environments we want. Cite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Leibnitz &quot;all possible worlds.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Can we imagine environments we don't want?
</em><br>
<p>Obviously ..... some people in antiquity invented hell.
<br>
<p>Does the ability to imagine any
<br>
<em>&gt;environments we want = ALL possible environments?
</em><br>
<p>There is a big academic literature on &quot;all possible worlds,&quot;
<br>
which is too involved and tiresome for discussion here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What makes you say only &quot;relatively&quot; innocuous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What potential dangers do you see?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Dunno.  Added the word relatively reflexively.  I don't actually see any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dangers, frankly.
</em><br>
<p>OK
<br>
<p><em>&gt; See points I made previously. You cannot deny that our brains are (1) E-1,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2) are self-organising, or (3) are infinite-state (as opposed to mu- or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finite-state.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't deny these things, I just utterly fail to see their relevance to
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;statements I made.  How does this conversation keep getting blown up into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evangelical proportions?
</em><br>
<p>You insult my theory as &quot;gobbledegook&quot; ... I am just trying to establish
<br>
that you have no grounds for this remark.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; MVT is based on scientifically repeatable experiments and observations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from nature. Your &quot;theory&quot; is just a personalised lingoistic
</em><br>
generalisation.
<br>
<p>What theory?
<br>
<p>Your 4 points towards self empowerment. I use &quot;quote marks&quot; precisely
<br>
because
<br>
I don't think your ideology deserves to be thought of as a theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; MVT does explain the mechanisms of all mentation, including dreams.
</em><br>
<p>That's nice.  So... -you're- the one with the theory, right?
<br>
<p>I was the first to *discover* (not invent) MVT back in 1980 .... it is open
<br>
to
<br>
falsification by you or anybody else, in fact I try to provoke a challenge
<br>
to it
<br>
on occasions, or find someone with a better theory, but MVT happens to be
<br>
true.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But, as pro-science Extropians and what-not, we automatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are proposing a future radically at odds with the Amish vision ....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and therefore must be able to make a strong case for advancement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than comfortable stasis (along with its limiting, religious
</em><br>
beliefs).
<br>
<p>I thought you weren't interested in removing limiting beliefs, just false
<br>
ones?  Is it 'false' for the Amish to believe that a simpler life will make
<br>
them happy?
<br>
<p>No, this is a lifestyle choice .. but their claim that God exists is a truth
<br>
claim.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There are various depths of trance .. from wakefulness, through daydreams,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to deep catatonic somnambulism. But, yes, all mentation is &quot;hallucination&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if fairly mundane such as the hallucination of our internal voice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (thought).
</em><br>
<p>Why is &quot;hallucination&quot; a useful concept here?  What is the alternative?
<br>
<p>A fair question. I make the distinction between *internally generated*
<br>
(hallucinated) mentation and *externally originating* real virtuality ...
<br>
in non-jargon, if you speak out load, even to yourself, the voice you hear
<br>
is not &quot;hallucinated&quot; in the way that a purely internally generated
<br>
simulation
<br>
of your voice is. Such hallucinations (dreams, thought) are mundane, and
<br>
nothing to worry about though .....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; MVT explains this (naturally, I would say that,but happens to be the
</em><br>
case).
<br>
<p>Why did we even start talking about MVT?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; let me ask you a question ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can use MVT to devise new types of hypnotic induction (mind control).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Should I use these techniques to promote my own agenda or not?
</em><br>
<p>...oh yeah, you wanted to talk about using it to control people's minds...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Sure, I will be very beneficent, and put them in a &quot;better&quot; state of mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More people will be happier, therefore you think I should do it?
</em><br>
<p>If more utility results (and this is debatable,) then, yes, you should do
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;So, if you're asking, do I agree with ALL forms of personal empowerment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my answer is a definitive no.  I'm a big fan of lots of them, however.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aha, so you are building qualifiers into your initial statement.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I'm only doing so to appease your need for semantic nit-picking.  In
<br>
real life, I don't need to go around saying things like: &quot;I love ice-cream!
<br>
Except for stuff that's been sitting out for 6 weeks, turned brown, and
<br>
begun to emit a foul stench.&quot;  With you it's like: &quot;I'm in favor of personal
<br>
empowerment!  Except the kind of empowerment where someone uses their
<br>
god-like mental powers to turn the rest of us into mindless zombies.&quot;
<br>
It's silly.
<br>
<p>Disagree ... the important thing is to decide the boundaries
<br>
for our personal empowerment ... both of us agree that in broad, banal
<br>
terms it is a good thing ... I am interested in the praxis more than the
<br>
theory.
<br>
<p>Don't take this conversation too personally ... I am a professional arguer.
