<p><p>This would not be a problem.  Every high pressure (4500+ psi)

nitrogen tank I've ever used was wrapped in a thin Kevlar cloth shroud. 
<br>
Upon explosive decompression (due to overpressure, for example), the
<br>
aramid fiber shroud catches all the tank fragments while allowing the gas
<br>
to escape through the fine weave of the shroud.  In practice it works very
<br>
well.
<br>
<p>I don't know why they would do it any differently in a car, particularly
<br>
since a cheap and proven solution already exists.  I've never seen a
<br>
lightweight (ceramic composite) tank that didn't have one of these
<br>
shrouds.
