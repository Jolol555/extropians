<p>Okay, extropy means &quot;the extent of a system's intelligence, information,
<br>
order, vitality, and capacity for improvement.&quot;

<p>It sounds like entropy and extropy mean opposite things, because I thought
<br>
entropy was a concept related to the second law of thermodynamics.
<br>
&quot;The second law is expressed mathematically in terms of the concept of
<br>
entropy. When a body absorbs an amount of heat Q from a reservoir at
<br>
temperature T, the body gains and the reservoir loses an amount of entropy
<br>
S=Q/T. Thus, in a reversible adiabatic process (no heat change) there is
<br>
no change in the total entropy. If an amount of heat Q flows from a hot to
<br>
a cold body, the total entropy increases; because S=Q/T is larger for
<br>
smaller values of T, the cold body gains more entropy than the hot body
<br>
loses. The statement that heat never flows from a cold to a hot body can
<br>
be generalized by saying that in no spontaneous process does the total
<br>
entropy decrease. 8
<br>
In all real physical processes entropy increases; in ideal reversible
<br>
processes entropy remains constant. Thus, in the Carnot cycle, which is
<br>
reversible, there is no change in the total entropy. The engine itself
<br>
experiences no net change in entropy because it is returned to its
<br>
original state at the end of the cycle. The entropy gained by the low
<br>
temperature reservoir is equal to the entropy lost by the high temperature
<br>
reservoir. However, according to the formula S=Q/T, less heat need be
<br>
expelled into the low temperature reservoir than is extracted from the
<br>
high temperature reservoir for equal and opposite changes in entropy. In
<br>
the Carnot cycle this difference in heat appears as useful mechanical
<br>
work.&quot; <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/th/thermody.html">http://www.bartleby.com/65/th/thermody.html</a>

<p><em>&gt; But, more generally, adopting transhumanism generally tends to provoke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather strong views about what society should look like.  While
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians envision society with increasing extropy, there are a heck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a lot of transhumans who are technocratic, socialist, fascist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberal democrats, conserative republicans, etc.  (This is not name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calling; most of those who are, for example, transhuman fascists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-identify that way.)  Calling these views extropic is misleading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at best.
</em><br>
<p>If &quot;extropians envision society with increasing extropy&quot; it seems to me
<br>
that view can include transhumanism. Rather than misleading, I think that
<br>
calling the views of transhumanists extropic helps to establish some
<br>
common ground, and it also helps to update whatever paradigms attach to
<br>
old, established ideologies such as you list. In simplistic terms (I like
<br>
reductionism), entropy correlates to death and dying; while extropy
<br>
corresponds to life and living. Extropians can define extropy any way we
<br>
want to, obviously. I just think it's more extropic to include
<br>
transhumanism than to exclude it. Personally, I find both transhumanism
<br>
and extropianism to be more extropic than anything else except dhyana (a
<br>
Sanskrit word roughly translated as meditation).
