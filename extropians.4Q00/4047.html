Dear Jeremy:
<br>
<p>This is a really important sheaf of question(s). Let me say that I worry
<br>
about being up to the challenges of an unknown future, too. Permit me to
<br>
say that a degree in business per se is not useless, if you include a
<br>
focus on what &quot;eternal truths&quot; can be garnered from it--these may be
<br>
things you'll have to figure out for yourself, rather than what some
<br>
instructor or dean might tell you.
<br>
<p>I have my own game plan, which includes the following:
<br>
<p>1) Hone my people skills. Dealing with people is going to be important
<br>
even if the most important ones turn out to be artificial; in
<br>
particular, *I* am people and I am going to be spending a lot of time
<br>
with myself. Be capable of ruthless self-examination without narcissism
<br>
or obsession over failures. Self management and growth and belief system
<br>
management are far from wastes of time. The least sucky &quot;human
<br>
potential&quot; course I've found so far is Avatar. Edward de Bono and
<br>
several others I could name can help with practical ways to become a
<br>
better learner, listener, thinker and improviser. I'm planning to build
<br>
a website on &quot;gumptionology&quot;(--how to get un-stuck) as well.
<br>
<p>2) Get better at recognizing what &quot;good enough&quot; is, and where
<br>
perfectionism _is_ called for. Jonathan Bach has written a very
<br>
effective short article titled &quot;Playing the Expert Game&quot;, reprinted at
<br>
<a href="http://www.satisfice.com/articles/expert_game.pdf">http://www.satisfice.com/articles/expert_game.pdf</a>. I happen to be
<br>
focusing on a career in Software Quality Management, because if &quot;matter
<br>
will become software&quot;, it better not become &lt;insert successful buggy
<br>
software package name form 1984-2000 here&gt;. An excellent bullshit
<br>
detector is a bonus everywhere. Keep checking.
<br>
<p>3) Master/achieve something, to a degree that satisfies myself, in
<br>
parallel with paying attention to the other points I enumerate; &quot;lather,
<br>
rinse, repeat&quot;. It almost doesn't matter what I choose to master/achieve
<br>
next... BUT Don't assume I will have a &quot;career&quot; in the conventional
<br>
sense, learn to have justifiable pride in my intellect's resilience and
<br>
my capability to grow. Don't assume that any mastery I achieve will
<br>
permit me to rest on my laurels; don't count on a pension, don't build a
<br>
world view that includes &quot;retirement&quot; in the sense many people my
<br>
parents' age did. Build habits of directing and redirecting my
<br>
attention. Find people I like who know things I don't. Soak up whatever
<br>
I can. Create. Play. Collaborate. Become valuable and valued to others.
<br>
Don't define success the way tabloids, magazines, Hollywood seem to.
<br>
<p>4) I happen to have a cryonics contract, so: 
<br>
&nbsp;a) Do my best to help create a world I wouldn't mind being reanimated
<br>
in. 
<br>
&nbsp;b) As a corollary, Do my best to help build a world that wouldn't mind
<br>
bringing me back.
<br>
<p>And two rules courtesy of me and Terence McKenna:
<br>
<p>4) Keep paying attention. 
<br>
<p>5) Keep breathing.
<br>
<p>Good to make your acquaintance. Not everyone has to own an STM to get to
<br>
reach the Singularity. Or whatever's really around the corner.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
<p>Mike

<em>&gt; I've been tuning into the list which I must say is quite thrilling. I'm now a sophmore in school, and have no clue what I want to do with my life. After reading such books like The Age of Spiritual Machines etc... how can I possibly know what field to go into? Technology is just moving so quickly, and I know I am more aware of this than most (not including extropians of course) but how can I prepare myself for what is to come? Currently I'm in the business school of my University, however, I feel I am wasting my time. Any help is greatly appreciated.
