<p>
I'll keep this short, since Barbara Lamar made sensible points that I would 
<br>
echo, and Brian Atkins points out the flaws with Eliezer's suggestions.
<br>
<p>As Brian reminded Eliezer, this is a temporary solution. Better filtering 
<br>
tools are under construction that we hope will solve or alleviate the 
<br>
problem. I'm open to any constructive alternative suggestions.
<br>
<p>Two or three people seem to be wildly overreacting. All ExI members already 
<br>
have given us contact information. All we're asking of non-members is their 
<br>
true name and a verifiable telephone number (we're not even asking for an 
<br>
address now). Is that really so much to ask? We're not excluding anyone on 
<br>
the basis of their views, nor requiring that they join the organization 
<br>
that provides this forum.
<br>
<p>Apparently this is *not* a lot to ask. According to Shaun, a substantial 
<br>
proportion of those on the waiting list, when told about the policy, 
<br>
followed through with it within one day. Doesn't seem to be &quot;killing&quot; the 
<br>
list, does it? Perhaps we can have less hyperbole.
<br>
<p>As for Dan's comments, well I'm finding it hard to believe this is the same 
<br>
Dan Fabulich whose keenly analytical posts I'm use to. Setting some very 
<br>
simple ground rules is *crucial* to spontaneous order, not contrary to it. 
<br>
And self-direction does not mean letting anyone who feels like it take a 
<br>
dump on your carpet or walk around your home smashing your furniture and 
<br>
insulting your family and friends. As for making it look like we have 
<br>
something to hide--you've completely lost me here. *Anyone* can get on the 
<br>
list simply by letting us know their name and how to reach them 
<br>
(information which will be kept confidential). If they are unwilling to 
<br>
accord us this, then more likely *they* have something to hide.
<br>
<p>Its funny that no one has apparently even noticed that other organizations 
<br>
comparable to ExI DO NOT EVEN PROVIDE A PUBLIC FORUM. Organizations like 
<br>
Foresight send email to their people, but don't provide an open forum like 
<br>
this. Why do you suppose that might be? Why are we being criticized so much 
<br>
for asking so little before allowing complete strangers into our much loved 
<br>
and long-inhabited on-line home?
<br>
<p>To make one point clear: If someone wants to post pseudonymously to this 
<br>
list, they can still do that. One or two ExI officials will know who they 
<br>
are, but they can separate their posting name from their real name as far 
<br>
as everyone else is concerned.
<br>
<p>That's all I want to say on this topic, unless someone has constructive 
<br>
suggestions. I'd rather spent my ExI time working on the Retreat that we're 
<br>
planning for early in 2001, and the other projects that a number of us are 
<br>
working on.
<br>
<p>Onward!
<br>
