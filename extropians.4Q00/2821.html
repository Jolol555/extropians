Floating 'Smart Dust' May Be New Spy in the Sky
<br>
<p>By The San Francisco Chronicle
<br>
November 21, 2000
<br>
<p><p>If Kristofer Pister has his way, we will never think about dust in
<br>
quite the same way again.
<br>
<p>Pister is leading a team of researchers at the University of
<br>
California at Berkeley that is developing tiny, electronic devices
<br>
called &quot;smart dust,&quot; designed to capture mountains of information
<br>
about their surroundings while literally floating on air.
<br>
<p>If the project is successful, clouds of smart dust could one day be
<br>
used in an astonishing array of applications, from following enemy
<br>
troop movements and hunting Scud missiles to detecting toxic chemicals
<br>
in the environment and monitoring weather patterns around the globe.
<br>
<p>The idea behind smart dust is to pack sophisticated sensors, tiny
<br>
computers and wireless communicators onto minuscule &quot;motes&quot; of silicon
<br>
light enough to remain suspended in air for hours at a time. As the
<br>
motes drift on the wind, they can monitor the environment for light,
<br>
sound, temperature, chemical composition and a wide range of other
<br>
information, and beam that data back to a base station miles away.
<br>
<p>Pister, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer
<br>
science at UC Berkeley, said he came up with the idea for smart dust
<br>
eight years ago at a conference on future technology. &quot;I realized that
<br>
sensors, computers and communications were going to shrink down to
<br>
ridiculously small sizes,&quot; he said. &quot;So why not package them into a
<br>
single, tiny device?&quot;
<br>
<p>Pister submitted a proposal to the federal Defense Advanced Research
<br>
Projects Agency, a branch of the Defense Department, which agreed to
<br>
provide about $1.2 million over three years to fund the project.
<br>
<p>Each mote of smart dust is composed of a number of
<br>
microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS, wired together to form a
<br>
simple computer.
<br>
<p>MEMS are made using the same photolithographic techniques used to make
<br>
computer chips. Once perfected, they are relatively easy and
<br>
inexpensive to mass-produce. But unlike computer chips, which are
<br>
solid, MEMS contain moving parts.
<br>
<p>Patterns are etched with light into a silicon wafer to create
<br>
structures such as optical mirrors or tiny engines. Each mote contains
<br>
a solar cell to generate power, sensors that can be programmed to look
<br>
for specific information, a tiny computer that can store the
<br>
information and sort out which data is worth reporting, and a
<br>
communicator that enables the mote to be &quot;interrogated&quot; by the base
<br>
unit.
<br>
<p>Later versions may also contain a lilliputian lithium battery so the
<br>
motes can operate at night.
<br>
<p>While much of the technology used to develop smart dust already
<br>
exists, the UC researchers are breaking new ground by integrating
<br>
these systems into remarkably small, self-powered packages.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;We are pushing the limits of miniaturization, integration and power
<br>
management,&quot; said Brett Warneke, a graduate student in electrical
<br>
engineering working on the project.
<br>
<p>In one experiment to demonstrate the viability of the concept,
<br>
researchers deployed a golf ball-sized device on Twin Peaks in San
<br>
Francisco that measured weather conditions in the area - temperature,
<br>
light, barometric pressure and humidity - and beamed that information
<br>
back to a base station in Berkeley, more than 13 miles away.
<br>
<p>So far, the smallest device the UC researchers have developed is 62
<br>
cubic millimeters - about the size of a pea - but Pister expects to
<br>
shrink the devices to a nearly microscopic cubic millimeter by next
<br>
summer. At that scale, they would be truly like dust: small enough to
<br>
remain suspended in air, buoyed by the currents, sensing and
<br>
communicating for hours.
<br>
<p>One of the biggest hurdles the UC researchers face is building a
<br>
mechanism that can survive on extremely low power but is still capable
<br>
of sensing, sorting and sending vast amounts of information. For that
<br>
reason, they have designed a computer operating system called Tiny OS
<br>
that can function on a mere 512 bytes of RAM - about the amount of
<br>
processing power found in a toaster.
<br>
<p>The UC researchers are also experimenting with an ingenious optical
<br>
communicator called a corner-cube reflector, which enables the motes
<br>
to communicate while expending virtually no energy.
<br>
<p>Pioneered at the University of California at Los Angeles, the
<br>
reflector is essentially a tiny, hinged mirror that can flash millions
<br>
of Morse code-like signals per second. When a smart mote is
<br>
illuminated by a laser fired from the base station, the station can
<br>
&quot;read&quot; the code reflected in the twitching mirror. The mirror itself
<br>
is powered by electrostatic energy, the force that makes your socks
<br>
cling together when they come out of the dryer.
<br>
<p>Smart dust devices are now capable of communicating only with a single
<br>
base station, but will eventually be able to share information with
<br>
each other.  Such a system of &quot;massively distributed intelligence&quot;
<br>
will vastly increase their ability to organize and communicate
<br>
information.
<br>
<p>&quot;They will be able to do things collectively that they can't do
<br>
individually, just like an ant colony,&quot; Warneke said. &quot;An individual
<br>
ant isn't very smart, but collectively, they are very smart.&quot;
<br>
<p>Researchers are exploring a number of methods for deploying smart
<br>
dust. One involves the use of tiny, unmanned aircraft that would spray
<br>
motes over an area like a miniature crop duster and relay the
<br>
resulting information back to a base station. MLB Co., a Palo Alto
<br>
firm that develops experimental aircraft, has already built such a
<br>
plane - an 8-inch radio-controlled aircraft equipped with a video
<br>
camera that can stay aloft for 18 minutes at a speed of 60 mph.
<br>
<p>MLB's &quot;micro air vehicle&quot; could be useful in a battlefield situation
<br>
where low clouds impeded satellite surveillance. The tiny, unmanned
<br>
plane could soar undetected above the battlefield, disperse a swarm of
<br>
smart dust and begin relaying a stream of data about the movement of
<br>
enemy troops and equipment.
<br>
<p>The UC researchers are also exploring ways to prolong the time smart
<br>
dust remains airborne by adding &quot;wings&quot; like those on maple seeds. A
<br>
cubic-millimeter-sized mote dropped at 30,000 feet would normally take
<br>
five hours to reach the ground. By attaching wings, the researchers
<br>
hope to extend that period two- or three-fold.
<br>
<p>Other researchers are attaching tiny legs to the motes to create
<br>
so-called microbots or smart insects. Instead of wafting aimlessly
<br>
through the air like dust, microbots could be programmed to perform
<br>
specific tasks, such as crawling through a collapsed building to
<br>
search for warm bodies.
<br>
<p>&quot;Smart dust is like the brain, and we're building the body,&quot; said
<br>
Richard Yeh, a graduate student researcher specializing in
<br>
microrobotics who is working on the smart dust project.
<br>
<p>Yeh and his colleagues have already developed the basic components of
<br>
a smart insect - tiny, jointed members, which function as legs, and
<br>
minuscule motors, the equivalent of muscles. All that remains is to
<br>
connect the components to a mote of smart dust, a step Yeh expects to
<br>
accomplish within weeks.
<br>
<p>Although the smart dust research is supported by the Defense
<br>
Department, its proponents see many nonmilitary applications for it,
<br>
many for motes that would stay in one place.
<br>
<p>CRUNCHLESS CAP'N CRUNCH
<br>
<p>They could be used to detect fires and earthquakes, tailor the climate
<br>
in office buildings to suit the preferences of individual workers, and
<br>
monitor product quality from factory to consumer (a mote of smart dust
<br>
could tell, for example, if a box of Cap'n Crunch had been exposed to
<br>
high humidity, and lost its crunch, or if a crate filled with delicate
<br>
electronic components had been dropped).
<br>
<p>Like many other new technologies, smart dust clearly has the potential
<br>
to be used for nefarious purposes. Foreign governments (or our own),
<br>
terrorist organizations, criminals and industrial spies could use
<br>
high-tech motes to spy.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is a technology of total surveillance,&quot; said Richard Sclove,
<br>
founder of the Loka Institute, a nonprofit organization in Amherst,
<br>
Mass., that studies the social implications of technology.
<br>
<p>&quot;I have no doubt that there will be plenty of benign and wonderful
<br>
applications of this technology, but it's easier to imagine the lousy
<br>
ones.  The CIA and the National Security Administration would love to
<br>
get their hands on this, and there's no way to control what they do
<br>
with it.&quot;
<br>
<p>While Pister acknowledges the possibility that smart dust could be
<br>
misused, he says the potential benefits of the technology &quot;far, far
<br>
outweigh&quot; any risks.
<br>
<p>&quot;You can find harmful effects in everything,&quot; added Yeh. &quot;But the
<br>
threat is small. If a rogue state wanted to use them to spy on us,
<br>
they could do it, but not much more. They probably couldn't carry
<br>
enough poison or gas to do much damage.&quot;
<br>
<p>The specter of millions, or even billions, of electronic motes
<br>
drifting around the globe has also raised concerns about the potential
<br>
ill effects on the environment and health.
<br>
<p>But Pister dismissed such concerns. &quot;Even in my wildest imagination, I
<br>
don't think we'll ever produce enough smart dust to bother anyone,&quot; he
<br>
said. &quot;Most of these materials are not environmentally
<br>
harmful. Essentially they are made out of sand, and that's not toxic.&quot;
<br>
<p>Potentially, the most dangerous element of a smart dust mote would be
<br>
the lithium battery, Pister says, but its minuscule size would pose
<br>
little risk.
<br>
<p>&quot;A small town throws away more batteries per year than we can
<br>
distribute across the entire universe,&quot; he said. &quot;It's really a
<br>
question of trade-offs.  If you can sprinkle a few ounces of battery
<br>
over a rain forest and thereby get a better understanding of the
<br>
ecology, that's a trade-off worth making.&quot;
<br>
<p>And what if someone accidentally inhaled a mote of smart dust? &quot;If by
<br>
ill chance you did inhale one, it would be like inhaling a gnat. You'd
<br>
cough it up post-haste. Unpleasant, but not very likely.&quot;
