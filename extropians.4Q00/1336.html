I hate to make my first contribution here something
<br>
concerning the Bible. I am rather more interested in
<br>
discussing Extropianism here than discussing a book
<br>
that most likely most people here do not agree with
<br>
(or for that matter read). However, in the name of
<br>
putting this subject to bed, I'll make a short
<br>
contribution.
<br>
<p>People who claim that the Bible says PI = 3 show their
<br>
ignorance of the science of measurement rather than some
<br>
trivial, unimportant error in an ancient non-mathematical
<br>
text.
<br>
<p>Here is what it says:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now he made the sea of cast metal ten cubits from brim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to brim, circular in form, and its height was five cubits,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and thirty cubits in circumference.
</em><br>
<p>All measurements are expressed to a degree of accuracy. If I
<br>
say a room is ten feet by ten feet, I obviously mean that it
<br>
ten feet wide, to the nearest foot, and ten feet long, to the
<br>
nearest foot. This is basic and fundamental to the science
<br>
of measurement.
<br>
<p>Consequently, we read that the diameter was 10 cubits, it obviously
<br>
means ten cubits to the nearest cubit, and that the circumference
<br>
was 30 cubits, obviously, meaning 30 cubits to the nearest cubit.
<br>
<p>So we know the diameter was between 9.5 cubits and 10.5 cubits,
<br>
and that the circumference was between 29.5 and 30.5 cubits.
<br>
So, for example, if the diameter was 9.7 cubits, then the
<br>
circumference would be 9.7 x 3.14 = 30.46 cubits. By these numbers
<br>
a circle with diameter 9.7 cubits (being 10 cubits to the nearest
<br>
cubit) would have a circumference of 30.46 cubits (being 30 cubits
<br>
to the nearest cubit.) Hence it is entirely possible to make a 
<br>
circle of diameter ten cubits (to the nearest cubit), and a
<br>
circumference of 30 cubits (to the nearest cubit).
