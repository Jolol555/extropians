I also read Cassini Division and got a slightly
<br>
diffent impression. MacLeod (who's sympathys are
<br>
certainly with the &quot;beautiful people&quot;) also points out
<br>
the advantages of the &quot;outworlders&quot; The new martian's
<br>
are a great deal more advanced than the Earthers.
<br>
Earth manufacting is not capible of matching the New
<br>
Martians. And the Earth technology including those
<br>
really spiffy &quot;smart suits&quot; is considered quaint. The
<br>
main character even wounders if competition may be
<br>
necessary for real advancement. Earth in the story is
<br>
a rather boring and stagnent utopia .
<br>
just my 2cents worth

<em>&gt; I read &quot;The Cassini Division&quot; by Ken MacLeod over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the weekend.  I couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find any mention of it in the archives at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though I think I recall some discussion here once.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was well written (or maybe it had been too long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since I'd read SF and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed a fix).  People like us are clearly the bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guys in the book, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was interesting to see what our worse crimes are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from MacLeod's perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MacLeod seems to favor some sort of socialist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society, though he was never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very clear how it worked.  He is, however, able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depict an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anarcho-capitalist society, and it isn't a terrible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place -- just culturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backward and unsophisticated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **** SPOILER WARNING - I'm going to say what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens! ****
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The people in his socialist society think uploads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are just machines without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any inner life worth considering, but the main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; character of the book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually get temporarily uploaded and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realizes that she is wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems that according to MacLeod, our great crime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is selfishness. When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth was in bad shape, the people in space split
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into two factions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;beautiful people&quot; who had lots of sex and wanted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help Earth, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;outwarder&quot; nerds who only cared about conquering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe for selfish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glory.  At some point the outward faction violently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grabs a bunch of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources, kills lots of the others, and uploads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more of them to serve as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slaves.  They go off to Jupiter, take apart a moon,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create millions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upload copies to do their dirty work, become huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million-mind-equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures, and build a wormhole.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They then get stuck in virtual reality navel-gazing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and broadcast viruses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that destroy all computers and telecom on Earth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forcing Earth to from then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on use mechanical computers and no radio. Earth folk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are about to destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them all, but then try to talk, and find creatures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Jupiter that seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable.  Earth asks them to stop the viruses,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and asks them to explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to use the wormhole to get to a distant colony
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of anarcho-capitalists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the Jupiter folk do both.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many groups in the anarcho-capitalist colony then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide they want trade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Jupiter and send ships there through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wormhole, ignoring Earth-folk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warnings about the viruses.  Viruses from somewhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Jupiter then take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over those ships, which is then a justification for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killing all life/mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Jupiter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So MacLeod's bottom line is that we're right about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that technologies like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading and wormholes and anarcho-capitalism can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work as envisioned, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that our selfishness will do us in.  It makes us get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuck in navel-gazing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and when we are powerful it makes us so irresistibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grabby that others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will get together to kill us all.  When we stay as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weak humans we create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies that work, but are culturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unsophisticated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose the image is similar to that of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ferengi in Star Trek NG,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;ugly, greedy and sexist&quot; traders -- useful to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around, but not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort you'd want to socialize with, or have sex with,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and definitely not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sort you'd want to allow to have substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power.  Which if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think about it is the stereotype of the nerd.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all this fits with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my theories of why people don't like cryonics, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why they aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thrilled with our becoming superhuman.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately these stereotypes do have a basis in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality.  People
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this list do on average give the impression to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outsiders of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less sexy, less culturally sophisticated, more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selfish, and more caring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about things and stuff out there than people around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here.  And ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people do seem to have deeply ingrained fears of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; letting such people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My response to all this is not to deny stereotypes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding values,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but to deny that the facts will make them very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant.  The common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SF scenario is a small group of people who have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge influence over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history and society, usually via their access to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, and whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values are pivotal to the outcome.  But this has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost never happened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the past, and isn't likely to happen in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most change is due to large broad social forces, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large enough to have substantial power over others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are controlled by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coalitions of many types of people, with many types
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of values.  SF
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenarios where a few nerds could take over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world with the tech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (AI, nanotech, wormhole, etc.) that they develop in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their obscure lab
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are just fantasy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Selfish techie nerds are and will remain largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerless, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if all the changes we forsee and promote come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pass.  We may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pivotal in making people pay attention to these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibilities, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they happen after that it will be because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social forces and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widely shared values - our differing values won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter much.
