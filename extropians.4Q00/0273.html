<em>&gt; Why not just give crims an environment where they can do what they like; go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around slaughtering people if you want. Basically it's just Doom anyway.

<em>&gt; What's all this karma crap?

</em><br>
<p><p>Simply this, if it is all just &quot;Doom&quot;, then there is no reality, no real
<br>
context or pushback.  Once we get uploaded I think it is going to be
<br>
increasingly important to define realities a bit more strictly.  Would
<br>
you like to spend the next umpteen millenia in environments where other
<br>
entities will wipe out your being in that environment just for the heck
<br>
of it because after all you are fully backed up and so on?  It doesn't
<br>
sound like good fun to me.  
<br>
<p>For the crims and a special hypothetical environment that is just a big
<br>
&quot;Doom&quot;, well, the problem is there is zero opportunity to learn to live
<br>
in a less violent environment.  There are no repercussions and no
<br>
incentives (beyond hopefully eventual boredom).  There may well be such
<br>
environments but I doubt they would be useful for anything but certain
<br>
types of &quot;entertainment&quot;.  This may mark me as really odd but personally
<br>
I don't have any use for environments where people frag other people for
<br>
fun.  I realize that some people do.  To me that makes them odd.  But
<br>
heh, it takes all kinds.
