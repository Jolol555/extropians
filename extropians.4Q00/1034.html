[ Non-member submission ]
<br>
<p>Perhaps I can appeal to the collective brains trust of readers on this list
<br>
for suggestions of good reading material covering 'where the world has come
<br>
to, and possibly where it is going', especially by authors and intellectuals
<br>
that have a broader view of history, and not too much technological myopia.
<br>
Personally I am trying to escape my technological parochialism and get a
<br>
clearer picture of where technology fits into the direction of society (my
<br>
professional concerns are with a general picture of technology and society).
<br>
<p>So far I have read the following:
<br>
<p>1. Manuel Castells - The Information Age ... magnum opus from a long time
<br>
scholar which a more socialist perspective on globalisation, who develops
<br>
important concepts and perspectives on the way that peoples and cultures are
<br>
being organised globally, and particular pressure points and issues that may
<br>
continue to shape future events, based on years of pragmatic research and
<br>
investigation.
<br>
<p>2. Thomas Friedman - The Lexus and the Olive Tree ... pulitzer prize winning
<br>
author writes something of a pop book on globalisation by appealing to
<br>
popularist notions of McDonalds and well known global brands and products,
<br>
generally centered around the power of the financial markets and the
<br>
economic dimension of globalisation as it impacts on the way people live.
<br>
<p>3. J.M. Roberts - The Penguin History of the Twentieth Century ... well
<br>
known and accomplisted historian writes on the twentieth century as a
<br>
cronological tale of major structures and forces prevelant around the world
<br>
prior to 1901, and then the developments across the globe as events shaped
<br>
and developed across the century with a strong sense of concepts and
<br>
structures.
<br>
<p>What I have not read so far (but intend to) is:
<br>
<p>4. Jacques Barzun - From Dawn to Decadence : 500 years of Western Cultural
<br>
Life, 1500 to the Present
<br>
5. David Reynolds - One World Divisible : A Global History Since 1945
<br>
<p>This is amidst a mix of other things, including sci fi, pop futurism, and so
<br>
on.
<br>
<p>Further suggestions ? Comments ? Hopefully any suggestions will be for the
<br>
wider benefit of readers, not just myself.
<br>
<p>Best regards,
<br>
Sir Matthew the Wanker.
