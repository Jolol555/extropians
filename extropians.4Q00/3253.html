<br>
&nbsp;such a ref in the good book? -Zero  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is something to the effect about there being angels at the four 
<br>
corners of the Earth.  I think today you will find that is generally 
<br>
interpreted as meaning the entire earth is watched over.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to be a little careful about the change in language used up to 
<br>
four thousand years ago and the way it is used today.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard a preacher, last summer, mention being in Hebrew class in 
<br>
seminary and having an assignment to translate a certain section of the old 
<br>
testament.  He was certain he had made a laughably inaccurate translation 
<br>
because he read it as God telling one of the prophets, &quot;Go into the 
<br>
wilderness and bury your underwear.&quot;  His instructor being well aware of the 
<br>
sentence pressed the student for a translation and got the young guy's best 
<br>
effort, &quot;Go into the wilderness and bury your underwear.&quot;  The instructor 
<br>
enjoyed a chuckle along with the rest of the class and then complimented the 
<br>
student on his accuracy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out that in that day only the upper class wore underwear.  The 
<br>
prophet was really being told in the language of the day to go to the 
<br>
wilderness and get rid of his hoity toity habits of thought.
