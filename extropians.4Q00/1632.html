<p>Actually, reading the archives at those two great sites Greg provided links for,
<br>
ONE MOL mission was supposed to be a NAVY only mission. They didn't want any
<br>
USAF staff in the air or on the ground involved in that one. BTW: Its not
<br>
shouting when you capitalize a military branch, thats a command voice being
<br>
implied, not a shrieking civilian. ;-)
<br>
<p>Now, the code word 'BLUE' does not necessarily imply navy involvement, since we
<br>
have the HAVE BLUE, TACIT BLUE, and other stealth projects that were exclusively
<br>
USAF territory. As the Deep Cold site says, the USAF was planning to use the
<br>
Gemini capsule system into the 70's for many missions, the MOL being just a part
<br>
of that goal. They were envisioning space based anti-missile systems maintained
<br>
by BLUE GEMINI missions as far back as 1967 apparently.
<br>
<p>Now that it is after midnight, whew, I can post again... ;)
<br>
<p>Now, that November 3, 1966 Gemini B mission is extremely curious. Not only did
<br>
they launch it with a 'mock-up' MOL, but they launched an OV1 observation
<br>
vehicle as well, which had its own propulsion system, and THREE OV4 vehicles as
<br>
well. The OV series of vehicles were autonomous satellites WITH reentry
<br>
capabilities for a 35 kg cargo (presumably film). Now, its curious that there
<br>
were FOUR other spacecraft other than the Gemini B capsule and the proto-MOL,
<br>
since the MOL was supposed to carry FOUR film return capsules. Interesting, huh?
<br>
If the MOL was such a 'mock up', why was it equipped with these spacecraft that
<br>
seemed to wind up in their own orbits before reentering?
<br>
<p>Now, early November of '66 was a busy time. On the 6th, Lunar Orbiter 2
<br>
launched, to survey possible landing sites for the Apollo program. On the 8th,
<br>
the USAF launched its KH-4A surveillance satellite, and that week the Soviets
<br>
were assembling the first N1 heavy launcher for their own lunar program, but
<br>
were having problems. On the 11th, the Gemini 12 mission went up (which
<br>
conducted tethering experiments) with an Agena logistics ship as well. The
<br>
database online does not say when the mockup MOL re-entered, and the two were in
<br>
very close orbits, with only a three degree inclination difference at the same
<br>
altitude of 290 km, so even if the prototype Gemini B capsule ejected on ascent
<br>
to re-enter to test the new hatch that went through the heat shield, the MOL
<br>
mockup was likely still in orbit when Gemini 12 went up on the 11th. Gemini 12
<br>
was in orbit for almost four days, and Aldrin performed some EVA work as well.
<br>
<p>Here's some other events in the Cold War during this period:
<br>
1966
<br>
January: ICBM, Minuteman II, with improved accuracy, enters service.
<br>
February: Vietnam: Senate hearings on the Vietnam War chaired by Senator
<br>
Fulbright begin.
<br>
March 16: 10,000 Buddhists march in Saigon protesting U.S. support for corrupt
<br>
Ky regime. 
<br>
March 25: Anti-Vietnam War rallies staged in seven United States and European
<br>
cities.
<br>
April 30: Chinese Cultural Revolution begins with Chou En-lai's call for
<br>
anti-bourgeois struggle.
<br>
June 2: Surveyor I makes perfect soft landing on moon.
<br>
December: Vietnam: U.S. forces number 362,000 in Vietnam.
<br>
<p>1967
<br>
January 27: Outer Space Treaty limits military uses of space, signed by the
<br>
United States,
<br>
U.S.S.R. and 60 other nations.
<br>
February 14: Treaty of Tlatelolco, signed in Mexico by all Latin American states
<br>
except Cuba,  prohibits the introduction or manufacture of nuclear weapons.
<br>
June 5: Six-Day, Arab-Israeli War begins.
<br>
June 17: China explodes its first hydrogen bomb.
<br>
October 18: Soviet Venus IV probe lands on Venus.
<br>
December: Vietnam: U.S. forces number 485,000 in Vietnam.
<br>
<p>I'm betting this was a little more than a 'mock-up'.
<br>
<p>What I am wondering is how far along they got, if they actually built anything
<br>
or not. I'm also wondering where the plans to Skylab and MOL went off to, and
<br>
wondering why some private group isn't getting aholt of the engineering database
<br>
for Skylab to build a private space station on the cheap. I mean, it ought to be
<br>
easy to build a space station on 1970's technology levels, with Moore's Law and
<br>
everything. Hey Doug, what do you think?
<br>
<p>A Titan III or IV ought to be able to put it in orbit, especially after you
<br>
replace all the old electronics with modern processors, cut the solar panels in
<br>
half and replace them with GAs/GAn panels at twice the efficiency, and use newer
<br>
alloys on the pressure hull.
