Warning: future appears turbulent
<br>
Column by Dale McFeatters
<br>
<p>The top seers and swamis at the World Future Society 
<br>
have squinted over the horizon and come up with a 
<br>
forecast of what's in store for us in the coming
<br>
decade, century and millennium. It is not a pretty 
<br>
sight.
<br>
<p>For a start, it's good-bye to Socks and Buddy. And 
<br>
maybe good-bye to us. Intelligent robot pets will be 
<br>
common by 2005 and outnumber &quot;organic pets&quot; by 2020.
<br>
<p>Their owners might not be real, either. &quot;Virtual 
<br>
assistants&quot; will start replacing executive secretaries 
<br>
in 2007, and by 2020 we'll be sharing the planet with 
<br>
synthetic intelligent life forms that will have legal 
<br>
rights, meaning that as lawsuits become ever more 
<br>
creative and pervasive you might be sued by your 
<br>
virtual cat.
<br>
<p>But there's new hope for medieval French lit majors. A 
<br>
liberal arts degree will be more valuable than a 
<br>
specialized education because technology will
<br>
change so fast than no sooner is a technical skill 
<br>
mastered than it's obsolete.
<br>
<p>While the college degree is nice, it will probably be 
<br>
from Rec Room U. Home schooling will lead to a home-
<br>
college movement and 50 percent of private colleges 
<br>
and 10 percent of public colleges will close because 
<br>
so many students are staying home to study online.
<br>
<p>But the new jobs will be fun, fun, fun. Thanks to 
<br>
improved productivity and longer lifespans, people 
<br>
will have more free time - where have we heard that
<br>
one before - and thus leisure-oriented businesses - 
<br>
think 21st-century amusement parks - will dominate the 
<br>
world economy and account for half of U.S. GDP by 2015.
<br>
<p>President Clinton was wrong when he said most workers 
<br>
will change jobs six or seven times in a career. The 
<br>
futurists say most workers will stay with a single 
<br>
company throughout their working lives. Companies will 
<br>
not so much hire workers as adopt them.
<br>
<p>Most baby boomers will keep working after they retire- 
<br>
they'll have to because of inadequate pensions and 
<br>
Social Security.
<br>
<p>But help is on the way. The &quot;echo boomers&quot;, the 80 
<br>
million Americans born from 1977 to 1997, will be a 
<br>
far more money-savvy generation, flush with cash and 
<br>
economic clout. That's good because if the futurists 
<br>
are right, they'll be supporting their parents.
<br>
<p>The generation that follows may be a faint echo 
<br>
indeed. More people will elect to remain single and 
<br>
postpone having children who will be mostly girls
<br>
when they do have them.
<br>
<p>But there's no rush because medical advances will 
<br>
allow women to delay menopause until 70. That means 
<br>
people in their 80s will be raising teenage
<br>
daughters, which goes a long way toward explaining the 
<br>
next prediction.
<br>
<p>Mental illness will reach epidemic proportions as the 
<br>
population ages.
<br>
<p>But no less a person than Sir Arthur Clarke says that 
<br>
electronic monitoring will eliminate professional 
<br>
criminals from society by 2010.
<br>
<p>That would still leave us at the mercy of random 
<br>
pyschos and disgruntled day traders and software 
<br>
testers.
<br>
<p>Specially bred bacteria will extract oil reserves that 
<br>
cannot now be tapped through conventional methods, but 
<br>
in 50 years we won't need the oil anyway because 
<br>
thermonuclear fusion will provide us with unlimited, 
<br>
cheap energy in the form of hydrogen.
<br>
<p>Nobody has said what happens when the bugs run out of 
<br>
oil and start heading our way. Perhaps nothing because 
<br>
we might not even be here.
<br>
<p>Humans will land on Mars in 2022, opening the way for 
<br>
colonization, and on Halley's Comet in 2061, where we 
<br>
will discover both active and dormant life forms.
<br>
<p>That's important because by the year 3000 most 
<br>
economic activity will be in outer space and it would 
<br>
be good to have a ready-made customer base already
<br>
there.
<br>
<p>There's the future for you. Don't say you weren't 
<br>
warned.
<br>
<p>It may not be too late to turn back.
