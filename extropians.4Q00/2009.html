<em>&gt; Hi Damien,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Running out of eggs? PLEEEEASE........ !
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me thinks you've been absorbing pharmaceutical sales schlock aka 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;clinical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science.&quot; So your sources are questioned and requested.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Women don't even begin to peak before 50.
</em><br>
<p>I also question the &quot;running out of eggs driven aging&quot; excerpt from THE
<br>
LAST MORTAL GENERATION.  If I'm not mistaken, humans are the only species
<br>
in which menopause takes place. I've been told of anthropological
<br>
research showing that menopausal women are more productive at gathering
<br>
food from the wild than younger women. I've been meaning to contact the
<br>
person who told me this and ask for her source(s). 
<br>
<p>One theory of evolution of menopause in humans is that a woman would be
<br>
able to pass down more of her genes if she remained alive during a period
<br>
of time after her reproductive functions stopped. This would allow her to
<br>
help her daughters and sons take care of their children.
<br>
<p>I suspect that bone loss is driven as much by diet and lifestyle as by
<br>
lack of ovarian function. I've had friends who had hysterectomies with
<br>
removal of ovaries when they were in their 20's and 30's, and they did
<br>
not become brittle boned and wrikled (true, they were taking supplemental
<br>
estrogen and progesterone). OTOH, I know women in their 30's who are
<br>
presumably NOT sinsemilla and who look and act older than other women I
<br>
know who have experienced menopause. 
<br>
<p>Bottom line: the phenomenon of aging isn't all that simple.
<br>
