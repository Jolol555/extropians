<p>
Lately, I've come to respect the idea that a libertarian society will
<br>
require no political revolution, but, rather, it will require a moral
<br>
revolution.
<br>
<p>A key argument in favor of polycentric law is that I want to keep my
<br>
freedom more than you want to take it away from me, and that I'll
<br>
reveal that preference relative to yours in the market, so our rights
<br>
will be maintained according to our revealed preferences.
<br>
<p>But this is not so; there are people who want to control you (in
<br>
certain ways) much more than you want to have control over yourself.
<br>
Every day we reveal our preference for living peacefully under a
<br>
government rather than fighting a revolution.  As some people are fond
<br>
of pointing out, in a weak sense, we're already living in anarchy.  In
<br>
particular, we're already living under anarcho-capitalism, in a weak
<br>
sense.
<br>
<p>Of course I realize that if you try to start up your own private
<br>
protection agency and stop paying taxes, you'll probably be shot.  But
<br>
those are simply the most economically efficient rules for this area.
<br>
For comparison, try starting a PPA; see how efficient this turns out
<br>
to be.
<br>
<p>But we don't just want anarcho-capitalism in this weak sense... we
<br>
want it in the stronger sense, under which no one will shoot us for
<br>
starting one's own PPA or arbitration organization.
<br>
<p>If so, and you bought my argument above, MUCH more needs to change
<br>
than simply who holds the guns.  The revealed preferences of most of
<br>
the entire population in this area has to change.  People have to want
<br>
their own freedoms more than anyone else wants to take them away.  We
<br>
all have to believe that this is morally right.
<br>
<p>This is quite a change from a society in which most citizens routinely
<br>
vote for legislators who intend to govern over them.  The citizenry
<br>
not only believes that government is acceptable; they believe it is
<br>
morally right.
<br>
<p>In poverty stricken despotic countries around the world, the deepest
<br>
problem isn't political: it's moral.  Corruption runs rampant amongst
<br>
the police, and not, in many cases, on account of excessive power.
<br>
You might expect that the dictators would be corrupt, but the police?
<br>
They're just police, with no more no less power than the police around
<br>
here.  But still, the police are corrupt.
<br>
<p>Think about it.  How can you have a society that follows rules when
<br>
the very POLICE are corrupt?
<br>
<p>Now, maybe the problem here is that the wrong people are the police,
<br>
and if someone managed to stage a successful revolution, this would
<br>
all get better.  But I doubt it, in most of these cases.  Instead, the
<br>
society sees it as the right of the mighty to oppress their lessers.
<br>
If they want a revolt at all, they don't want a revolt so they can
<br>
replace the government with honest people; they want a revolt so that
<br>
THEY can be the corrupt police.
<br>
<p>A simple revolution is inadequate in these areas.  The people would
<br>
have to see that it's not only wrong for the police to oppress THEM,
<br>
but that it's wrong for anyone to oppress anyone else.  Their revealed
<br>
preferences altered, they would then choose to revolt, if need be.
<br>
<p>Similarly here: people would reveal their preferences for polycentric
<br>
law or a minimalist government if they wanted it.  But they don't want
<br>
it.  Until they want a libertarian society, they'll never get it.
