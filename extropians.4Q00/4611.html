<p>
The need to define sanity indicates a desire to prove ourselves sane.
<br>
<p>But the whole history of humanity proves that humanity lacks sanity as
<br>
much
<br>
as it lacks anything. Basically, humanity proves itself insane by fighting
<br>
five thousand wars in the last three thousand years. The greed, jealousy,
<br>
and selfishness that prevails throughout human social orders indicates the
<br>
dominance of something other than sanity.
<br>
<p>Sane people exult in doing what comes naturally, in satisfying a
<br>
congenital
<br>
appetite for the beauty of reason, the thrill of understanding, the
<br>
excitement of knowing reality directly.
<br>
<p>A wise man once defined sanity as &quot;coming out of the mind into the open,
<br>
into the silence, where no thought, no desire disturbs you. In that pool
<br>
of
<br>
silence, with not a single ripple upon it, sanity abides.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sanity means to secure your happiness, and by extension, the happiness of
<br>
your neighbors, family, friends, and community, since one cannot really
<br>
feel
<br>
happy when surrounded by misery.
<br>
<p>When your means fulfill your ends, if you can manage that -- the harmony
<br>
between the means and the end -- then you've got sanity. When your means
<br>
don't satisfy your end, and you continue to repeat the same means, never
<br>
arriving at a gratifying end, then you've got a neurosis. &quot;Make every act
<br>
of
<br>
your life dedicated to love and sanity arises out of it,&quot; a romantic man
<br>
has
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>When liberated people want to play the game of sanity, they live as sanely
<br>
as anyone can live. Then they can outdo Aristotle with logic and reason.
<br>
They can follow every rule and regulation. But if they want to play the
<br>
lunatic game, then they can become as demagogic, theologic, and ideologic
<br>
as
<br>
any other maniac.
<br>
<p><p>The perfectly sane brain thinks only when necessary. It reverts to
<br>
ecstatic
<br>
tranquility (i.e., it allows  thought-noise to dissipate, clearing the way
<br>
for the emergence of superlative sentience or learning) whenever it can,
<br>
for
<br>
as long as it can. Conversely, the insane brain cannot stop chattering.
<br>
<p>A psychologist asked a psychonomer, &quot;How do you deal with neurotics?&quot;
<br>
<p>The psychonomer replied, &quot;We trap them?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Oh? And how do you do that?&quot; asked the psychologist.
<br>
<p>&quot;By making it impossible for them to ask any more questions,&quot; answered the
<br>
psychonomer.
<br>
<p>Keep smiling,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>&quot;Something beckons within the reach of each of us
<br>
to save heroic genius. Find it, and do it.
<br>
For as goes heroic genius, so goes humankind.&quot;
<br>
--Alligator Grundy, _Analects of Atman_
