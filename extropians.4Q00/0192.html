<em>&gt;  Jeez and Bush Papa did serious business with the Reich until he was forced

<em>&gt; Jeez, Spudboy, I just asked a question.  We can go on and on if we are trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be embarrassing to one another.  For example: --------nah, I refuse to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that even even though the material is factual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     But I stick with my question: was Armand Hammer the guy at Occidental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that helped Al Gore's daddy so much?  I believe that money is still in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family.
</em><br>
<p>Gore's family does have a large amount of money in Occidental Oil, and received
<br>
lots of campaign funding from Occidental, during which time the elder Gore's
<br>
stances on issues drifted markedly to the left, which eventually caused his
<br>
losing the election in conservative Tennessee. Several years later Al Gore Jr.
<br>
ran for congress on a decidedly more conservative platform than his father would
<br>
support (and he banished his father from his campaign), taking stances contrary
<br>
to those he allegedly held while a reporter at the liberal Tennesseean
<br>
newspaper, and only slipping back to liberal stances after joining Clinton and
<br>
losing many policy fights early in the administration to Hillary (she originally
<br>
wanted his office for herself also) only when her disastrous health care plans
<br>
failed and the GOP came resurgent in congress did Gore gain back control of many
<br>
policy issues that were under his original contract with Bill Clinton as part of
<br>
his agreement to be his vice president.
