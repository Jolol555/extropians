<p>Obviously, you can't make it solid. It has to be a cloud of objects in

actively controlled orbits.

<p>As an aside, I recently ran into the solar satellite fleet power

people again. The new model includes large-aperture solid state phased
<br>
array microwave radiating antenna (principle similiar to SAR) directly
<br>
integrated into the thin solar cells. It is LEO-based, and tracks
<br>
receiving rectenna arrays on the ground. From a critical satellite
<br>
density onward, you have a total coverage, one satellite taking over
<br>
when one moves out of the direct line of vision. One doesn't need that

much hardware in the skies, surprisingly, and of course this can

greatly profit from linear mass driver launched solar sats fashioned

from lunar material.

No way, dude. Because Arkuat's going to eat it.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Megascale engineering could give a planet its complete atmosphere and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; home sun radiation exposures and gravitational effects regardless of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; whether the sun still existed if it had novaed.  So, it would be a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; projected sun in the sky, and the surrounding stars at night, with
</em><br>
<em> &gt; regular gravity.
</em><br>

<br>
Megascale engineering gives you means to dismantle the planets, and
<br>
intercept the entire solar output.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; If the Earth is 25,000 miles in circumference, it would have to be
</em><br>
<em> &gt; bigger than that.  Refer to Anders Sandberg's web pages for megascale
</em><br>
<em> &gt; engineering.
