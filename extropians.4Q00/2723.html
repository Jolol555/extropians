<p><p>Sure, when so used.  I used them a fair bid in the end of the hippie
<br>
years.  At the time they were great psychological dynamite for
<br>
unraveling old structures and building new ones.  It introduced me to
<br>
the &quot;I&quot; within but distinct from belief, thought and personality
<br>
structure overlays.  But they are not for everyone and few know how to
<br>
use them well and most have other negativities (besides backwards laws)
<br>
against them.  At some point many, many years ago I got it that I had
<br>
gained all I could from their use and needed to integrate what I had
<br>
learned. That will probably keep me busy for many more  years.  I also
<br>
found that meditation produced much more integrated and focused effects
<br>
(though generally without the fireworks) than the psychedelics did. 
<br>
Meditation sneaks up on you differently.
