<em>&gt;Personally, I agree with L. Neil Smith.  The Libertarian party will not

</em><br>
<p>While I agree that you've expressed the underlying philosophy of 
<br>
Libertarianism:  If we are relying upon a plurality of American 
<br>
voters to get on board for the sake of one simple (albeit logical and 
<br>
paramount) idea, we're doomed.
<br>
<p>Developing a plurality in American politics requires forming 
<br>
coalitions of people interested in different party planks. 
<br>
Libertarians need the cooperation of the pot heads, the gun 
<br>
enthusiasts, the gays, the entrepreneurs, the pro-choicers, etc. 
<br>
They're not going to all buy into the underlying principle (at least 
<br>
not at first), but they'll at least give us their consideration if we 
<br>
advertise the party planks that they like.
<br>
<p>One of the things that I personally *love* about the LP is how the 
<br>
positions on the favorite issues of all of those groups can be 
<br>
logically and easily obtained from the guiding principle that you 
<br>
mentioned above.
<br>
<p>The Democrats and the Republicans, however, are forced to cobble 
<br>
together coalitions that lack the strength of a unifying principle. 
<br>
Instead, they're forced to live with their little intellectual 
<br>
dishonesties:  Republicans talk about &quot;rugged individualism&quot;, but the 
<br>
moment you take a mind-altering substance besides alcohol, you're a 
<br>
criminal.  Democrats talk about freedom of expression, but if the KKK 
<br>
wants to adopt a stretch of highway, that's the &quot;wrong&quot; kind of 
<br>
expression.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; But the Republicans are the only ones even *willing to entertain* a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  reduction of taxes and a corresponding decrease in the size of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Federal Government.  As the Government's size decreases, they'll have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;[...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sure they will &quot;entertain&quot; a reduction in how much of your money the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will steal in order to take away more of your rights than they have any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intention of acknowledging, much less protecting.  The Republicans will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never, ever, reduce their drain on the economy enough to undermine their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own favorite tyrannies against the American people they claim to serve.
</em><br>
<p>I agree to an extent.  However, after we've achieved what we can by 
<br>
working from within one of the dominant parties, I'd much rather 
<br>
fight a Republican-dominated government that has a tax (and power) 
<br>
base of 1x than a Democrat-dominated government that has a tax (and 
<br>
power) base of 2x or 3x.  Plus, the subsequent battle with the 
<br>
Republicans will be about repealing &quot;tyrannical&quot; laws.  The 
<br>
subsequent battle with the Democrats will be about taking away 
<br>
entitlements.  In general, the former is easier to accomplish.
<br>
<p>Creating a new and valid political party in this country that will be 
<br>
capable of competing with the Republicrats will be extraordinarily 
<br>
difficult - especially when you consider that Libertarians don't have 
<br>
those purely emotional core groups like the Democrats have minority 
<br>
groups and the Republicans have religious groups.  I'm helping where 
<br>
I can, and I support the Libertarians where I can, but realistically, 
<br>
I think that I'm more likely to see some of the issues I'm looking 
<br>
for addressed by the Republicans.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
