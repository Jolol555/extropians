Not to fan any acrimony flames, but given that information wants to be
<br>
free, how do you plan to achieve privacy in 2005? In 2010? In 2020?
<br>
<p>The evolution of cooperation stuff indicates that rough parity among all
<br>
players is essential for cooperation to be a good strategy. Pure
<br>
individualism in its rawest form is hard to distinguish from
<br>
pyschopathology unless the observer has confidence in the shared values
<br>
of the observed. Think Mickey and Mallory in _Natural Born Killers_.
<br>
<p>The mantra you mention is far from valueless to me. Please don't make me
<br>
your enemy just yet. 
<br>
<p>Principles *are* important. One principle that's important is not to
<br>
burn the barn down while the horse is still inside.

<em>&gt; As long term list members will recall, we have had some acrimonious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debates with David Brin on this list about his attitudes towards privacy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He ran into similar highly negative responses from others in the online
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe it is this issue which has brought him to his present meta-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis of attitudes and ideologies.  It was a terrible shock to him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to find himself accused of supporting tyranny and wanting to quash the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom of individuals to communicate privately.  He didn't really think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of himself as tyrant material.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So he has launched a meta ideological battle on a number of fronts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguing against ideology itself in favor of pragmatic compromise.  He also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be attacking individualist philosophy.  His mantra, &quot;I am a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; member of a civilization&quot; is meant to remind us of how we owe to others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I consider the ideas Brin is pushing to be significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threats to the values which are most important to me.  I don't want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonize the guy, but based strictly on his current writings I have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view him as an enemy.  I hope people can see past the smiling face and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jokey writing style to recognize the importance and seriousness of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues he is raising.  David Brin is a dedicated and sincere ideological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warrior who is fighting a long-term, well-planned campaign to use his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing skills to influence public opinion.
</em><br>
