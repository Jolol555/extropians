<p><em>&gt; Charter of Fundamental Rights of EU
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Adopted by EU Parliament, november 2000, the 14th]
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; Article 3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right to the integrity of the person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his or her physical and mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integrity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.  In the fields of medicine and biology, the following must be respected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in particular:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -  the free and informed consent of the person concerned, according to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedures laid down by law,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -   the prohibition of eugenic practices, in particular those aiming at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection of persons,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -   the prohibition on making the human body and its parts as such a source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of financial gain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -   the prohibition of the reproductive cloning of human beings.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I know of this article. It is interesting to consider the
<br>
underlying philosophy here. It all hinges on how you define integrity,
<br>
and that is a hairy issue. Quite often it seems that it becomes
<br>
confused with having unique genes, and that leads to very silly laws. 
<br>
<p>I like to view integrity as the issue of self-ownership of one's
<br>
internal information (a kind of extension of Article 8). Moral
<br>
integrity means that I make my own moral decisions without being too
<br>
influenced by external attempts to influence or coerce me. This can be
<br>
seen as saying that my moral software is not amenable to outside
<br>
rewriting. Personal integrity implies that I have a right to keep my
<br>
personal information (like my genes or thoughts) private - or to
<br>
voluntarily decide to share it.
<br>
<p>Integrity is the basis of informed consent, and there I have little
<br>
problems with the writing. In fact, I might want to extend it - the
<br>
current sale of Icelandic and Tongan genetic information might
<br>
constitute a breach of the personal integrity of the citizens there
<br>
since it was not done by them or with their consent. 
<br>
<p>On the other hand, from my point of view there is hence little
<br>
problems with selecting genes etc (there is no person there to violate
<br>
the integrity of - that person will exist later, partially as a result
<br>
of the actions) or selling body parts - that really follows from
<br>
self-ownership. And banning reproductive cloning is a rather arbitrary
<br>
decision about who should be allowed to have children with who and
<br>
how, largely based on the genes=integrity view (which often is stated
<br>
in silly terms like the right to have an unique genome, which make
<br>
twins somehow victims of mutual integrity infringement).
