Umm. I remember the Agena, and I remember the MOL project. I can't of
<br>
course prove that the Agenas *didn't* carry cameras, but can you give a
<br>
cite for Agena stages being called MOLs? As best I can recall, the MOL
<br>
was a Navy project, human habitable in design, final design had the
<br>
Gemini mated ass to the can with crew transfers through a porthole in
<br>
the heat shield; and never flew. As I recall, there were some
<br>
preliminary studies of twin-can &quot;swinging&quot; MOL-like designs, with a SNAP
<br>
nuke reactor at the &quot;far&quot; end. It seems oversilly to me for even the
<br>
'60s fedgov to name an Agena with a docking collar a Manned Orbiting
<br>
Laboratory.

<p>More than microgravity, in one case--though that was blamed on &quot;stuck
<br>
thrusters&quot;--later, the excuse was that the Gemini computer had the wrong
<br>
attitude control program loaded and tried to orient the Gemini-Agena
<br>
system as if it were just the Gemini. Oops. And that was with the two
<br>
hard docked. 
<br>
<p>I don't remember hearing about tethers at the time, either, but that
<br>
doesn't mean they didn't do it. It's an obvious thing to try. I'll do
<br>
some snooping on the NASA history sites and see what they say.
