<em>&gt;The lost continent of Lemuria was originally theorized as a land
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bridge in the Indian Ocean which connected Africa and India.  It was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intended to explain how lemures migrated across the ocean, hence the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;name.  The theory has been discounted since it was first proposed.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't know how occultists connected Lemuria with Mu, or how it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;translocated to the Pacific ocean.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know either, but the Pacific reference seems to be quite
<br>
old.
<br>
<p>My own reference is a 40-page booklet I bought on a climbing/hiking
<br>
trip ~8 years ago called, _The Mt. Shasta Story_ by A.F. Eichorn,
<br>
1957. This booklet quotes passages from:
<br>
<p>_Lemuria, The Lost Continent of the Pacific_ by W.S. Cerve, 1931
<br>
_Unveiled Mysteries_ by Godre Ray King, 1934
<br>
_A Dweller on Two Planets_ by Phylos the Thibetan, 1894
<br>
_Romance of Two Worlds_ by Marie Corelli, 1886
<br>
The Submerged Contents of Atlantis and Lemuria_ by Rudolph Steiner
<br>
(date is not listed)
<br>
<p>In _The Mt. Shasta Story_, the location of Lemuria is specific:
<br>
<p>&quot;In the early chapters of the Lemurian story [by Cerve], we learn
<br>
that many thousands of years ago a great continent existed in the
<br>
area now covered by the mighty Pacific Ocean. [...] This once great
<br>
continent of Lemuria is alleged to have been several thousand miles
<br>
in length and almost two thousand miles in width. Here existed the
<br>
world's oldest civilization, the people of which, were possessed of
<br>
supernatural powers and learning. During the geological changes in
<br>
the surface of the earth, This great continent slowly began to sink
<br>
into the waters of the Pacific. [...] The Lemurian legend reveals
<br>
that as the western portion of their great continent slowly began to
<br>
sink into the waters of the Pacific. [...] a great migration
<br>
occurred as the Lemurians moved to other parts of their continent...
<br>
many moved to the eastern portion and sought refuge in the high
<br>
mountains along the eastern shore, one of these higher peaks
<br>
incidentlly being Mt. Shasta. [...] The general theory is that many
<br>
of the survivors of the Lemurian catastrophe settled somewhere in
<br>
the vastness of Mt. Shasta, and by certain indications remain there
<br>
at the present time, exactly where is still unknown. We therefore
<br>
delve into Mr. Cerve's book to see if it is possible for this
<br>
advanced race of people to survive in such an unlikely place as an
<br>
extinct volcano [...]&quot;

</em><br>
<em>&gt;I wonder how long this `legend' has existed?
</em><br>
<p>This particular legend goes back at least a hundred years.
<br>
<p>However Mt. Shasta seems to be a convergence (as it were!) for every
<br>
kind of crystal-carrying-occultic-pure-light-bell-ringing modern-day
<br>
religionist. My little booklet listed at least 4 other white man
<br>
legends (The &quot;I AM&quot; story, the Little Men story, the Yaktayvians and
<br>
their great bells underneath the mountain ...) attributed to Mt
<br>
Shasta. A large number of Indian legends add to the folklore of the
<br>
area too. I find the New-Agey atmosphere in the Mt. Shasta area
<br>
humorous and peculiar and quaint.
<br>
<p>That's not why I like to visit the area though. In my opinion, it
<br>
is one of the most beautiful parts of the U.S. The mountain itself
<br>
is awesome for hiking and climbing and simply *looking* (it's
<br>
splendid and HUGE)
<br>
<p>[... here, take a look at the mountain from one of my favorite bookmarks:
<br>
<a href="http://www.mtshasta.com/shastcam/cam.html">http://www.mtshasta.com/shastcam/cam.html</a>  ]
<br>
<p>and Crater Lake and Klamath Lake (Oregon)
<br>
(<a href="http://www.amara.com/photo/klamath.html">http://www.amara.com/photo/klamath.html</a>) are a short drive away.
<br>
<p>Great vacation spot, with or without the Lemurians :-) .
