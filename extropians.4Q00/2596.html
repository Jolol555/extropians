I got a letter from Alcor yesterday (Thursday) about this.  They are
<br>
licensing vitrification technology from 21st Century Medicine.  This
<br>
will enable greatly improved suspensions and hopefully eliminate much
<br>
of the damage from ice crystal formation.
<br>
<p>However, it is only for neurosuspensions.  (Those involve freezing only
<br>
the head.)  The technology requires very rapid cooling, and this is not
<br>
yet practical to achieve with whole body suspensions.  Even if it does
<br>
become practical, Alcor warns that it may be a much more difficult and
<br>
expensive procedure, and therefore they may have to raise the cost for
<br>
whole body suspensions.  Whole body suspension members like myself are
<br>
advised to consider converting to neurosuspensions in order to take
<br>
advantage of this new technology.
<br>
<p>Personally, I will wait and see.  My health is good and so I can hope
<br>
that they are able to get it working for whole body members within a
<br>
few years.  If it costs more at the end, so be it.
<br>
<p>(The reason I am a whole body member is because I believe there is
<br>
information in the muscles, spinal cord and other tissues which will not
<br>
be recoverable in a cloned body.  This includes both learned information
<br>
as well as basic issues of neural architecture which are not fully
<br>
determined by genetics.  Fitting an old head to a new body may not be
<br>
practical, I fear.)
