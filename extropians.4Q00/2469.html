nicq:
<br>
Then you are blind.  Every day, we are bombarded with advertising, messages,
<br>
and memetic influences that keep us enslaved to materialism.  Why do I live
<br>
such a self-destructive life that I can't seem to find a way to escape?
<br>
Mainly because I'm a powerless, corporate pawn.  I don't want the life that
<br>
I have- but I know no way out, at least none that looks very appealing the
<br>
minute I step out into the cold Minnesota air.
<br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
You claim you have no power and are a pawn so you have no power.  Take
<br>
responsibility for your own life rather than blaming some nebulous corporate
<br>
evil.  Are you claiming that advertising, messages and &quot;memetic influences&quot;
<br>
are more powerful than your own will and choices?  Really?  
<br>
<p>Do you equate advertising and memetics with physical force?  I hope you
<br>
never have a blunt lesson in the actual and extremely large difference.  Do
<br>
you equate the power of the dollar with the power of a gun threatening your
<br>
very life if you do not conform to the wielders orders?
<br>
<p>The only way to escape memetics totally is to run off to a deserted island.
<br>
Memetics are a natural part of any communicating species existence. Clearly,
<br>
living outside of all society and interaction with others is not reasonable.
<br>
<p>It sounds to me you are seeking an escape from reality itself.  There is
<br>
only one escape from that.  I don't think you want to go there.
