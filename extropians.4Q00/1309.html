</em><br>
<em>&gt;colonizing all sorts of niches? So, maybe you've got some folks running

</em><br>
<p>The intuition that all niches eventually get filled is appealing, and my
<br>
guess is that it is probably true eventually.  But when is eventually?
<br>
The point of doing analysis is to make clearer the connections between
<br>
assumptions and conclusions.  My analysis makes certain assumptions and
<br>
gets certain conclusions.  When such conclusions are surprising one needs
<br>
to re-examine both one's intuitions and assumptions.
<br>
<p>My analysis suggests, as per Eugene's taxonomy above, to get the universe
<br>
colonized, it is not enough to just have enough variation among stars in
<br>
tendencies to go out and explore.  Once selection works on that variation
<br>
to produce lots of colonization, you also need enough variation in those
<br>
colonists to then produce ones who choose to stop moving and settle down.
<br>
<p>My guess would be that the main variation of this sort would come from
<br>
slower waves moving out from the same central source of variation, instead
<br>
of changes in the &quot;genome&quot; of leading edge colonists.  To estimate how
<br>
much slower the next wave would be, I need better estimates of the
<br>
functional forms for my model.
