<p>
Just an interesting questionon social dynamics and personal perception:
<br>
<p>Does anyone else see the tendency of people as they grow older to romanticize
<br>
their own pasts, to talk fondly of the &quot;good old days&quot;, such as when that nice
<br>
boy down the street had to spend six months in an iron lung because of 
<br>
polio, or back when that girl in the front of the class showed up with bruises
<br>
and black eyes because she'd &quot;fallen down the stairs&quot;?
<br>
<p>It seems the fursther distant we grow from any event we personally experienced,
<br>
we seem to romanticize or at least nostalgize (is this even a word?) over it
<br>
more and more.  What sort of purpose does this pose, and what results in it? 
<br>
<p>It seems that, at least memetically, it is related to the slow calcification
<br>
and resistance to change that seems to occur as many people grow older.  Will
<br>
encouraging memetic flexibility over tiem eventually blunt this sense of
<br>
nostaliga, perhaps, and may it even possibly nullify the more reactionary 
<br>
elements of society?
<br>
<p>The reason this is so important is because quite possibly in the western
<br>
world we have seen a population peak - the &quot;baby boomer&quot; generation may be the
<br>
largest in most western nations, an this could increasingly make nostalgia 
<br>
less and less a simple cultural oddity and more and more an actual
<br>
sociopolitical threat to advancement and progress.
<br>
<p>Perhaps begin outreach to those approaching retiree age and attempt to get
<br>
extropian and transhumanist memes into their minds before they calcify?  Hmmm,
<br>
extropian missionaries sent to places like Arizona and Florida to speak of the
<br>
benefits of extropian thought (lide extension would be a big selling point
<br>
here) the way missionaries of certain Christian sects fan out across Asian,
<br>
African, and South American nations? It's an interesting thought.
