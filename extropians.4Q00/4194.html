<p>Here's a LoC I wrote to the Aussie zine SF COMMENTARY as long ago as 1996;
<br>
editor Bruce Gillespie is famously laggardly, so it's still awaiting
<br>
publication. I wrote:
<br>
<p>============
<br>
<p>Back in August, 1995, Australian Book Review ran a very nice piece by Peter
<br>
Nicholls on my Routledge book Reading by Starlight: Postmodern Science
<br>
Fiction (`a significant book', `miracles of synthesis', `certainly be
<br>
required reading for future scholars in the field'). I was surprised,
<br>
though, by the following claim:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does every now and then, however, evoke (often in footnotes or sardonic
<br>
asides) a proud, peculiarly Australian, aggressive (but also defensive)
<br>
intellectual elitism. This sometimes interferes with Broderick's usual
<br>
clarity of vision. For example, he accepts as a proper source of sf's canon
<br>
of excellence, David Pringle's 1985 book Science Fiction: The 100 Best
<br>
Novels, while scorning the list of these novels that have won Hugo awards
<br>
(voted upon by fans). Accepting the judgement of one not very distinguished
<br>
critic over the consensus of 500 or so readers is to founder on shifting
<br>
sands, no good foundation for arguments about competent sf as a whole.
<br>
<p>I sat down at once to draw up a list from Pringle's selections and match it
<br>
against the comparable Hugo winners. For technical reasons the selected
<br>
novels were sometimes offset by a year, but I made allowance for that as
<br>
best I could. Here are the two lists. Asterisks mark agreed choices:

So is it actually wrong-headed to `accept the judgement' of Pringle rather
<br>
than the 500-odd Hugo novel voters? Does Peter Nicholls really believe that
<br>
his own judgement as a specialist sf taster is not better and more reliable
<br>
than the majority vote of a small subset of several thousand fans
<br>
assembled? Can he really maintain that Gene Wolfe's long fiction must be
<br>
inferior because it has been passed over by a community which prefers to
<br>
honour David Brin and early Lois Bujold? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me a break. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the logic bit; more entertaining is the evidence of the above list,
<br>
which shows that in fact Pringle and Hugo voters agreed in 11 of the 31
<br>
comparable years! (Perhaps this populism is what marks him as a `not very
<br>
distinguished critic'?) What's more, his judgements do not vary in kind
<br>
from the conventioneers'. He likes Zelazny's Dream Master better than Lord
<br>
of Light, but the two are not Proust vs. Spillane. True, he regards Mirror
<br>
for Observers as a better book than They'd Rather Be Right, and it's hard
<br>
not to see this as a callously elitist move, but then again he does favour
<br>
The Stars My Destination over No Award as even a hardened old wardheeler
<br>
like Nicholls might do. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't know what he'd have chosen in the last few years, but I suspect
<br>
Pringle, Nicholls and I could scratch up a few titles of greater worth than
<br>
the schlock that's listed since, say, 1988 (and while I enjoy Card's two
<br>
winners, they simply aren't the best of the year - are they? are they?). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Nicholls also complained that I `implied' an `astoundingly
<br>
arbitrary' American sf `canon'. I rushed to the citation. Was this some
<br>
list where I'd madly praised Ray Cummings, Nat Schachner, Piers Anthony,
<br>
Ian Wallace, Jack Chalker, Ed Earl Repp, George H. Leonard, Randall Garrett
<br>
and Richard S. Meyers? No, it was a far more egregious tally of eccentric
<br>
non-entities:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phil Dick, Tom Disch, Robert Heinlein, Ursula Le Guin, Joanna Russ,
<br>
Theodore Sturgeon, Gene Wolfe and Roger Zelazny.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's true that some other obvious names were omitted, but that is because
<br>
I was trying to be epigrammatic rather than exhaustive (and I was drawing
<br>
on Samuel Delany's own choices for analysis, circa 1983). Maybe I could
<br>
have slotted in Isaac Asimov because of Delany's discussion of the
<br>
Foundation sequence. That leaves out a few from my personal canon (Bester,
<br>
Blish, Cordwainer Smith and van Vogt especially), and some other important
<br>
writers I like a little less or think less central (Bradbury, Budrys, Frank
<br>
Herbert, Phil Farmer, Leiber, Pohl, Sheckley, Vance, Vonnegut, Wilhelm).
<br>
Some truly important US writers were really too recent for inclusion in an
<br>
Important Old Farts List, although by calling on some later Delany pieces,
<br>
I could have - and perhaps should have - added Bill Gibson and John Varley;
<br>
obvious extras are Bear, Benford, Bishop, Crowley, Knight, James Morrow,
<br>
Stan Robinson, Schenck, Sterling, Swanwick, Vernor Vinge, Walter Jon
<br>
Williams, Connie Willis; one could, of course, go on, and many of these
<br>
were instanced anyway in the text proper. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite such grizzles, I suspect the only writer I named that Nicholls
<br>
might cavil at is Zelazny (although I think his early work was utterly
<br>
important as a poetic/louche catalyst), and the unforgivable absences might
<br>
be Bradbury and Herbert; and maybe Pohl and Sheckley; even that illiterate
<br>
cretin Doc Smith. But that doesn't add up to an insanely idiosyncratic
<br>
Oz-resentful `canon'. Waddaya reckon, Bruce?
<br>
<p><p>=======================
<br>
<p>I haven't bothered updating that list comparison here, and Vinge of course
<br>
has since got a gong, but waddaya reckon, Eliezer?
