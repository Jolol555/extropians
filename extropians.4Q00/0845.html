<p><em>&gt;&gt; As a death penalty advocate, I would be against any attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cryonically suspend anyone to whom the death penalty has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; administered.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, we seem to have another death penalty discussion at hand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This appears to generate lots of opinions, but little reasoning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from first principles.  When we administer criminal punishment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what are we trying to accomplish in the first place?  Several
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things come to mind:
</em><br>
<p>I would disagree, in fact the principals are quite simple:
<br>
<p>1)One may not murder another human being.
<br>
<p>2)If found to be in violation of principal (1), ones own life is  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;forfeit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- Revenge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I find it difficult to come to grips with this rationally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Clearly, we have a strong desire to do unto others as they do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   unto us, especially if they harmed us.  This looks like an    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    evolved survival trait, but I'm uncertain how to justify it in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   a rational manner.  The death penalty fulfills the revenge urge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   very well.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;- Reform.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   That's what they told us in religion/ethics class back in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   school. Supposedly reforming the criminal to make them a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   citizen is the primary purpose of punishment.  In practice, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   doesn't look like this to me.  Capital punishment does nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   for this, of course.
</em><br>
<p>Murder is the exception to this rule in my book.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- Removal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   This also applies to prison and deportation.  The goal is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   remove criminals from society in order to keep them from doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   any further harm.  Clearly, the death penalty is a supremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   effective means to get rid of a problem person.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- Restitution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Have the criminal repay the damage they did.  Basically, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is only applicable to property damage, and in practice usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  only to minor ones.  Putting a price tag on a human life is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  difficult, but killing yet another person doesn't provide any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  economic gain in itself.
</em><br>
<p>Restitution is not possible in the case of murder.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;- Deterrence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I'm under the impression that US experience tells that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   death
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   penalty does little to deter criminals, although I'm uncertain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   about the psychology involved.  If you build a system based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   deterrence, you have to carefully grade punishment.  Once     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   people are subject to the maximum penalty if caught, they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   nothing to lose, and that's one of the least things you want. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (&quot;Hey, I already killed a cop.  Five more won't change 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   anything.&quot;  Bad.)
</em><br>
<p>Deterence will not be a factor at the current rate of punishment.
<br>
there are a number of murders each day, there are not a number of
<br>
executions each day. Even someone of low intelligence can see the
<br>
lieklyhood of receiving the death penalty is small.
<br>
<p>--Punishment.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The death penalty is the only just punishment for the crime of  
<br>
murder. (IMO)
