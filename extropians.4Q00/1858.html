</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Harmful in what sense?  Making people choose actions that are less adaptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; means making them choose actions that lead to fewer descendants.  The paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is about what actions better satisfy the preferences of the people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whether that leads to more or fewer descendants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;All an evolutionary argument tells us is that changes in the discount
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rate would ultimate lead to less survival and, yes, fewer descendants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This may be due to increases in the death rate or decreases in the birth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rate.  Do we want to ignore the fact that a policy prescription may lead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to increases in the death rate?  Even if it acted through decrease in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;birth rate, that may be due to poorer health.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I keep asking the same question, which is, why is it OK for the paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to ignore these effects?
</em><br>
<p>I think you are missing the fundamental point that standard policy analysis
<br>
is a lot more libertarian than you expect.  It doesn't ask what policies
<br>
are good for people in some absolute sense, it asks what policies will give
<br>
people the things that they want.  If people are willing to suffer risks
<br>
of death to get, say, fun, then standard policy analysis wants them to
<br>
take such risks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Isn't it possible that the society which results from making all these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;changes, even though they are intended to satisfy people's preferences,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is one in which people are less happy than they would have been without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them?
</em><br>
<p>As Nick emphasized, standard policy analysis isn't about what makes
<br>
people happy, its about giving people what they want.  And the fact is
<br>
that people don't just want to be happy.  They are willing to give up
<br>
happiness to get other things.
