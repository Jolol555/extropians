</em><br>
<p>I consider this kind of use of time machines logically impossible; it's a
<br>
classic grandfather paradox.  In any case, such hypotheticals are 
<br>
impossible to calibratable; there's no way to determine if stated
<br>
preferences mean anything and excellent reasons that past 
<br>
preferences would be inaccurate and inconsistent.  There's sound
<br>
evolutionary reasons for them to be meaningless side-effects of
<br>
the real use of preferences, guiding action.
