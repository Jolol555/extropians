<em>&gt;This reminds me of an Edelman story. Apparently the science department was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in trouble because it had such a huge expense account. The math department
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bragged that it only needed chalk, paper, and a few waste paper baskets. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the philosophy department did even better. They didn't even need waste
</em><br>
<em>&gt;baskets. Get it? The philosophers didn't throw out their wrong questions.
</em><br>
<p>Why did you use the math department as an example of empirical 
<br>
research?  Math is based on logic, classification systems, 
<br>
consistency, nomenclature, conclusions, extrapolations, etc.  Most 
<br>
math is derived philosophically and logically.  It is only proved 
<br>
later by science empirically.  Einstein's E=MC^2 was a philosophical 
<br>
argument until science proved it later.  Imaginary numbers were a 
<br>
philosophical &quot;what-if&quot; argument that extended the rules, until 
<br>
physics and electricity confirmed them later.  Negative numbers and 
<br>
the concept of &quot;zero&quot; were abstractions demanded by philosophical 
<br>
logic and debate.  They were not discovered or empirically proven. 
<br>
It seems to me that all theory is philosophy, and the scientific 
<br>
method converts theory (possible fantasy) into fact (provable 
<br>
reality).
<br>
<p>Do you condemn logic, scientific method, theories, proofs, 
<br>
peer-review, extrapolation and imagination when you condemn 
<br>
philosophy?  Or do you exclude these from that realm when you condemn 
<br>
all philosophy?  If so, you may be condemning the parts of philosophy 
<br>
that I disdain while retaining the parts that I value.  That is, we 
<br>
may agree on our choices, and merely classify them with different 
<br>
labels.
