<p>Do you believe in objective facts in the realm of politics and rights or
<br>
not? Do you believe there is such a think as inalienable rights due to a
<br>
sentient creature by virtue of its nature, required by its nature for
<br>
its best functioning, or not?  If not then you are correct.  This
<br>
discussion is going nowhere.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Well, it wasn't.  And no one has a right to benefits stolen by force from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others.  Ever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right, according to whom? I keep trying to make the point that people are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operating from libertarian values, theory, etc. and then violating them. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply do not think libertarian theory is right, they don't value what we do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>According to an objective view of what rights do and do not consist of. 
<br>
Which is the only thing that could possibly support any position on
<br>
human ethics.  If they think differently then lets compare the quality
<br>
of the thinking, the reasoning and philosophy and its results (if any)
<br>
and decide which appears more reasonable.  Once again, truth is not a
<br>
matter of opinion.  Some values are mostly opinion at the current
<br>
primitive state of our philosophies and knowledge.  But what is needed
<br>
for humans to flourish is not arbitrary or infinitely malleable.  Truth
<br>
is not democratically arrived at.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;Will you change there minds by telling them they are right when they are not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think I'm getting great examples from you, actually. I keep trying to say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a large number of libertarians/extropes come off as know-it-alls, and keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people from paying attention to what they're saying. This in turn allows savvy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of the more statist political ideologies to get their attention (they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see what we're doing wrong, and don't do that) and then they play into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values voters hold. Not good at all for us. NOT everyone values individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom 1st, and there's nothing any of us can do about that. And yet, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confronted with it, we quote authors no one has ever heard of, beat people over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the head with theory no one agrees with, tell them it's ok for people to starve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or sell themselves into slavery, etc
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  I have never told anyone any such thing. &quot;Come off as
<br>
know-it-alls&quot;?  Do we really need to care whether there is a huge
<br>
anti-intellectual bias in this country?   You can put the situation into
<br>
words that have nothing to do with theory and are as down home as the
<br>
laundry.  You don't need to wave a copy of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; or
<br>
&quot;Libertarianism in One Lesson&quot; or whatever.  The fundamental principles
<br>
are actually not nearly as complex as the contorted rationalizations for
<br>
violating individual rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      You and I might (I think do) agree that if I earn money by honest means, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ought to be able to do with it as I will. Not everyone does, however. There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of people who think the government should control a portion of the economy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (with the largest arguments being over which portions) and should control what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people may do (pornography, scientific research into controversial areas, smart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drugs, etc.) I want to live, healthily, for a very long time. If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies which would enable me to do this aren't ever allowed to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed because the government is listening to people swayed by anti-tech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideologues, because they thought I was a smart-ass, what do I get??? The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfaction of being right? Fat lot of good that does you, dead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Then your only logical alternative is to do your best to minimize
<br>
government coercion across the board so they don't stop those
<br>
technologies from being developed.
