<em>&gt; I had a top-secret clearance and was building Arpanet before you knew

<p><em>&gt; Your talk of the &quot;early days&quot; is about two decades too late to impress me.

<p>Oh, yeah?  Well, I had to *walk* every day to deliver *my* email, six
<br>
miles each way.  Handforged each one and zero myself, because we were too
<br>
poor to afford a proper Babbage Machine. Raised my first Gopher site from
<br>
a pup...damn thing bite so bad once I needed eight stitches.  Why, I
<br>
remember one traceroute that took me 34 days and 3 pairs of shoes.
