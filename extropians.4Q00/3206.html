<p>&quot;Before the current age of science old age and death were very much
<br>
necessary parts of human life cycle as they are very much necessary
<br>
parts of the life cycle of other species that propagate by sexual
<br>
reproduction. It is only by becoming bright enough to go beyond mere
<br>
biology and natural selection that this becomes no longer the case.
<br>
There is some deep bonding to the birth, life, death cycle in creatures
<br>
such as we. It will not be instantaneous that many see it and go beyond
<br>
it. Have some compassion for your fellow creature's difficulty with
<br>
this. Go writing them off and they will simply write you off, perhaps
<br>
in worse ways than simply ignoring you&quot;
<br>
<p><p>That's nice, sensible attitude towards death. People have been adopting 
<br>
sensible attitudes towards death for a long, long time...and they keep 
<br>
putting them in the ground.
