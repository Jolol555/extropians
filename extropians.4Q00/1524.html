<p>
As a benefactor member of ExI, I must respectfully agree with your
<br>
complaints, but not your proposed response.
<br>
<p>Like you, I sent in my money and got nothing in return.  I have been too
<br>
busy to attend the expos, so I have not gotten any economic benefit.  I
<br>
could probably derive the same personal benefit from ExI without
<br>
contributing anything.
<br>
<p>However, I don't invest my money in ExI to get a monetary return.  That's
<br>
what the stock market is for.  I don't want to enjoy the benefits of this
<br>
list, the web site, or the ideas without contributing anything in return.  I
<br>
invest my money in ExI to help support the work of spreading futuristic
<br>
ideas.
<br>
<p>As you noted, communications with ExI has been sporadic.  Volunteer members
<br>
have been too overworked to attend to all the details as well as they should
<br>
have.  The paper publications have turned out to be too cost prohibitive.
<br>
Good web sites always take more time than people expect.
<br>
<p>ExI needs my money and volunteers to help them accomplish their goals.  The
<br>
flaws you point out only serve to highlight this need even more
<br>
emphatically.  I agree with all of the flaws you point out.  Rather than
<br>
avoiding sending in my money, your points have made me even more eager to
<br>
contribute to help keep ExI going.
<br>
