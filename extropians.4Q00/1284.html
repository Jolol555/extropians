<p>You could make yourself really skinny.
<br>
That way you could slip out of the sphincter of the Singularity and it could
<br>
close very tight behind you, leaving no hole at all (or only a puckered pimple).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; many of you expressed some noble inclinations. perhaps i'm just a
</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>Whoops! Another genetic dead end.

<em>&gt; Sure it's rational if one was to take an objective viewpoint. I think Spike

</em><br>
<p>So, like, people only behaved in a subjective manner before Darwin? Or did they
<br>
only behave in an objective manner back then? Oh, well. They probably did the
<br>
best they could. They might do better in today's world than we'd do in theirs,
<br>
don't you think?
<br>
It is interesting to wonder why people would behave sanely in an insane world.
<br>
But then, a sane person would abandon sanity in world of lunatics. So the
<br>
HYPOTHETICAL question loses its meaning when we remember the insanity of
<br>
humanity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually the more I think it over, it makes total sense, more sense than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the perennial puzzle of battlefield altruism.  Humans are animals, animals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have hardwired instinct somehow coded into the genes.  Even those of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans who have no desire to reproduce still have the overpowering urge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fuck each other's brains out, even at the possible risk of our lives.
</em><br>
Just
<br>
<em>&gt; like the other animals, eh?  Curious, but totally natural.  Human kind has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survived and prospered *because of* our natural memetic Darwinism.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Too bad our natural memetic Darwinism doesn't know what to do with weapons of
<br>
mass destruction except to destroy massively. The time has come to drop memetic
<br>
Darwinism, because it isn't fit for transhumans, and even less fit for extropic
<br>
Artilects and Spiritual Machines.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
