<p>
Extropes,
<br>
<p><p>In support of the recent admin policy to approve non-ExI members to
<br>
the email list discussions, I would like to point out that the
<br>
extropians mailing list is property of the Extropy Institute, and
<br>
therefore the Institute has every right to administrate the mailing
<br>
list as they wish.
<br>
<p>In addition,
<br>
<p>I see the approval procedure as a healthy experiment. Max and the
<br>
Extropy Institute created an environment to express and support
<br>
his/their views, to express and support others who have some
<br>
overlapping views, and in this  mailing list environment that they
<br>
have created, they hope to have a constructive and lively exchange
<br>
of opinions.
<br>
<p>When  a person creates something of value, the best thing that they
<br>
can do, if they want that thing to be healthy and to grow, is to act
<br>
towards that goal. Not acting to place structure or boundaries
<br>
around the thing that one cherishes, in my opinion, shows that one
<br>
doesn't care very much. And if events over time show the Extropy
<br>
Board that their particular &quot;structure&quot; has negative consequences
<br>
and doesn't work in the way that they had hoped, at least then they
<br>
have some new information of something that they tried that didn't
<br>
work, and they can employ a different strategy to nurture the list
<br>
environment.
<br>
<p>Max and the Extropy Board are employing on a larger scale, procedures
<br>
that I think are valuable on many scales, especially on small-scale
<br>
person-to-person interactions. Extropian person-to-person
<br>
interactions have a lot of room for improvement. Sometimes I think
<br>
that the technical savvy of many extropians is gained at the expense
<br>
of inexperience in the social realm and I encourage many here to
<br>
take some courses or study (and practice) from books on the topics
<br>
of &quot;interpersonal communication&quot; and/or &quot;assertiveness&quot;, and/or
<br>
&quot;ways of handling fear anger, and guilt&quot; (just to name a few
<br>
topics).
<br>
<p>Consider this: As extropian-types push their personal potential to
<br>
be bigger and better than they are, they will come into contact with
<br>
more varied cultures, more varied ages, more varied genders, and
<br>
generally more varied people. Therefore, it's more important than
<br>
ever to know yourself, know your value-system, express yourself
<br>
clearly, know how to ask for what you want, and take responsibility
<br>
for your actions. These skills guide a person in being true to
<br>
themselves and therefore to act as one with a solid core instead of
<br>
acting as a leaf blowing in the wind.
<br>
<p>We all know that even when we have created and worked through our
<br>
own value system, that then expressing and acting on our own values
<br>
can be difficult. That's where the &quot;boundary&quot;, &quot;personal rules&quot;,
<br>
etc. are helpful. Personal boundaries do not create alienation, they
<br>
safeguard those products of ourselves for contiguity. The
<br>
&quot;container&quot; aound our &quot;offerings&quot; -- whether the offering is a free
<br>
email list, a committment to a long friendship, a home for a stray
<br>
animal, giving reading lessons to a neighborhood kid, the big task
<br>
of raising one's own children to adulthood, or giving one's love to
<br>
another human being -- provides a sacred environment for the
<br>
offering to be cared for appropriately and to grow.
<br>
<p>For me, the more precious is the thing that I'm offering, the more
<br>
care and thought that I give to the container (environment) that I
<br>
create to help that seed of myself grow. To give up the container
<br>
would be like abandoning the thing that I held dear, and it would
<br>
not honor the part of myself that created it. No self-respecting
<br>
person would readily abandon something that is precious to them.
<br>
<p>Here's some tips about boundaries that I found in _Letting the Light
<br>
Through_ by D. Richo:
<br>
<p>1. Ask directly for what you want. This declares your identity to
<br>
others and to yourself.
<br>
<p>2. Foster good parenting to yourself, so that you can build an inner
<br>
intuitive sense that quickly lets you know when a situation (for
<br>
ex., a relationship) is hurtful, abusive, or invasive.
<br>
<p>3. Observe others' behavior toward you, safely, without getting
<br>
caught in their drama. That way you can decide uninfluenced by
<br>
another's seductive or aggressive actions.
<br>
<p>4. Maintain a bottom line: a limit to how many times you allow
<br>
someone to say no, lie, disappoint, or betray you before you
<br>
seriously act on the situation.
<br>
<p>5. Change the locus of trust from others to yourself: i.e. you let
<br>
go of expecting security, and trust yourself.
<br>
<p>Many people are expert at influencing guilt feelings in another
<br>
person, and we can also be expert at making ourselves feel guilty. Here
<br>
are some thoughts about that (I found this in the same booklet as
<br>
above).
<br>
<p>a) we have every right to ask for what what we want
<br>
b) we have a duty to ourselves to provide emotional and physical
<br>
safety. No one has the right to hurt you, even if he/she loves you.
<br>
c) there is nothing wrong with making mistakes or changing one's mind.
<br>
d) It is up to us, individually, to decide when and whether or not
<br>
we are each responsible for taking care of another's needs
<br>
e) we can say &quot;no&quot; or &quot;maybe&quot; without pressure in accordance with
<br>
someone else's timing
<br>
f) we can be illogical, if that's what we want to use for making decisions
<br>
g) we can have secrets, and decide how much of ourselves or our
<br>
lives to reveal
<br>
g) we can explain our choices, or not (i.e. we don't have to
<br>
describe or defend if we wish to say &quot;no, I don't want to&quot;
<br>
h) we can act non-assertively, and in some cases, that is appropriate too
<br>
<p>So, I suggest stepping back, and seeing a larger picture about what the
<br>
ExI board is trying to do with the email list, and perhaps that will
<br>
temper some of the knee-jerk reactions that I've seen.
