<em>&gt; I recall something about the &quot;4 winds&quot; but don't recall ever reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything about 4 corners (at least not in the KJV), and I think
</em><br>
something
<br>
<em>&gt; like that would have stuck with me.  Anybody know whether there is
</em><br>
really
<br>
<em>&gt; such a ref in the good book?

<p>Revelation Chapter 7, Verse 1:
<br>
&quot;And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of
<br>
the earth... &quot;

<em>&gt;     It is something to the effect about there being angels at the four
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corners of the Earth.  I think today you will find that is generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpreted as meaning the entire earth is watched over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     You have to be a little careful about the change in language used up
</em><br>
to
<br>

<p>Yes, that's right. Too bad the literalist Amish haven't learned this.
<br>
(According to the TV documentary I saw, Amish priests teach children that
<br>
the Earth is flat.)  It's also too bad the Amish children don't get to
<br>
learn about astronomy in school, and that they don't get to go beyond the
<br>
8th grade.

point than the fact than a drunken man is happier than a sober one.&quot;
