<p>&lt;&lt; We&quot; don't have quasi-human level AI yet, but that doesn't mean some secret 
<br>
US
<br>
&nbsp;agency doesn't have it (or isn't on the verge of breeding it). Whoever gets
<br>
&nbsp;human-competitive AI first will probably not have much interest in 
<br>
publicizing
<br>
&nbsp;this accomplishment, because human-competitive AI would be very useful in
<br>
&nbsp;breeding greater than human level AI, which would be much more valuable than
<br>
&nbsp;mere human-competitive AI.

&nbsp;As I see it, colonizing Mars will be a job for artificial life, not for us.

Whoa you are a pessimist!  I am guessing that if Hugo De Garis ain't working 
<br>
on military A.I. then its not being worked on by the best, which will slow 
<br>
things down-bigtime. The most the Military seems to do is create things like 
<br>
hopping mines and such. Colosus or Sky-Net (Forbin Project or 
<br>
Terminator-respectively).
<br>
<p>Look-after all the clever things the Lookheed Skunkworks has achived over the 
<br>
last several decades, it ain't much to show. A few still, top secret, drone 
<br>
aircraft, Tacit Blue and what-not, B2, F-119 Stealth Fighters. Not much to 
<br>
demonstrate, actually. 
<br>
The market (whether in the USA or Bollywood) will find use for A.I. when it 
<br>
becomes big! To make big money, they will require publicity to gain 
<br>
market-share. Got's ta' have customers, ta make money.
<br>
<p>Mars, will become a point of interest, in the 21st century (though I cannot 
<br>
swear by this), it all depends on the technology and how useful it may become 
<br>
for space colonization. Even more dramatic then the Genetic 
<br>
Algorithm-designed robot, announced at Brandeis two weeks ago is the 
<br>
potentiality for another technology. That technology has been termed 3D 
<br>
printing, or formally, Laser Sintering. A tech like this, which seems to be 
<br>
moving fast right now, seems to lead the way for a huge amount of change in 
<br>
society. Making goodies fron software templates, implies that asteroid 
<br>
colonization and such might well be rapidly achieveable for us monkeys to do. 
<br>
This seems like a dark-horse technology that might win and alter the race.
