I think there's a confusion present in whatever system
<br>
created this.  If we apply genetic terms to ideas, the
<br>
only assumption can be that they work to propogate
<br>
themselves, not people.  People can go die for all
<br>
ideas care.  Martyr, even.
<br>
There are a lot of flexible or adaptive type systems,
<br>
though, that will occasionally make a move to
<br>
accomodate another system in order to enhance its own
<br>
success, but this is usually the exception rather than
<br>
the rule.  I seem to remember certain neurological
<br>
studies reported in this book I read yesterday called
<br>
&quot;A New Psychology of Men&quot; (I know, sounds stupid, but
<br>
I had several hours in the library and had already
<br>
gotten through ten books in the last two) in which it
<br>
said that male babies tend to actually be more
<br>
emotional than female ones- and drew the conclusion
<br>
that there are sociologically inherent structures
<br>
which try to teach men to be unemotional in some
<br>
respects through isolation and emotional scarring. 
<br>
Being that the social structure of a species is
<br>
adaptive and at least semi-functional in terms of
<br>
system survival (a whole branch of sociology is
<br>
dedicated to this stuff, actually), it may be one case
<br>
in which our individual genetic/behavioral
<br>
predilections are overriden by another reflexive
<br>
system- in this case the behavior of the societal
<br>
organism/brain/whatever.
