Dean K. Shibata, M.D., has discovered that humor appreciation
<br>
&nbsp;- our ability to recognize a joke - appears to be based in the
<br>
lower frontal lobes of the brain. It is the first study that captures
<br>
images of the brain, using functional magnetic resonance imaging
<br>
(FMRI), to determine what areas become active when we experience
<br>
something humorous.
<br>
&quot;Why do we laugh? No one really knows,&quot; Shibata said. &quot;But knowing
<br>
which areas of the brain are involved gives us an idea of how humor is
<br>
processed, what functions it may be related to, and ultimately how
<br>
it may have developed. This is important because it provides insight
<br>
into social and emotional behavior, and how we communicate
<br>
and foster relationships.&quot;
<br>
Connecting the brain's response to humor, which plays a powerful role
<br>
in shaping our personalities, is significant for many reasons.
<br>
It could aid physicians in diagnosing and treating patients with mental
<br>
illness or mood disorders such as depression, by showing the brain's
<br>
response to positive stimuli. Traditionally, research has focused on the
<br>
brain's response to negative emotions such as fear.
<br>
It could provide surgeons with valuable pre-operative mapping of the brain
<br>
areas critical for maintaining the emotions and social behaviors that
<br>
make up our personalities.
<br>
It advances science, proving the value of new and sophisticated tools
<br>
that can provide glimpses into the brain and how it works.
<br>
It helps to demonstrate that mental activity, even one as evanescent
<br>
and complex as humor, has a physical correlate.
<br>
Other studies, involving stroke and seizure patients, have tried to
<br>
correlate brain abnormalities with either uncontrollable laughing episodes
<br>
or a loss of the sense of humor.
<br>
But in Shibata's research, MRI scans were performed on 13 normal
<br>
volunteers in a series of four exams. The scans directly visualized what
<br>
parts of the brain were involved when the subjects read written jokes,
<br>
viewed cartoons and listened to digital recordings of laughter.
<br>
The MRI scans showed that when the subjects saw the jokes and cartoons
<br>
- tasks that require a decoding of the humorous stimuli - the brain activity
<br>
was most prominent in the ventromedial frontal lobe. This suggests that the
<br>
frontal lobe is responsible for telling us what's funny.
<br>
But when they heard laughter and laughed along internally, a response
<br>
known as contagious laughter, the activity was centered in the anterior
<br>
supplemental motor area. That part of the frontal lobe near the top of the
<br>
brain is normally associated with planning complex movements and
<br>
initiating speech.
<br>
All four scans also showed activity in a small spot at the base of the
<br>
brain, called the nucleus accumbens, an interesting area associated
<br>
with positive emotions in animals and identified as a key site in moderating
<br>
drug addiction.
<br>
Activity in the nucleus accumbens is likely related to our feeling of mirth
<br>
after hearing a good joke and our &quot;addiction&quot; to humor, Shibata said.
