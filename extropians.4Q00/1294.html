<em>&gt; It isn't a question of resources, or intelligence, or foresight, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compassion.  It is a question of ability to coordinate and commit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider the analogy of firms trying to collude to raise prices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They each have a common interest in so colluding, but also a private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest in secretly violating the agreement and selling more at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lower price.  Even though firms are smart with great resources, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is their inability to coordinate and commit that typically drops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices to far below the collusive level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Outcomes, especially ones that claim we wouldn't get to hatch if a more
<br>
intelligent species had come through this sector, very much are a
<br>
question of intelligence, foresight, morality and so on along with the
<br>
things you name.  There is no a priori reason why we should assume that
<br>
more advanced species than ourselves are at all covered by an analogy of
<br>
competing firms or any other analogy from current earthside economics. 
<br>
I won't go into where your analogy isn't necessarily so clear cut even
<br>
in earthside economics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there is just one colonizing agency, then yes, they might assign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property rights to places to colonize, and take their time about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if some other &quot;sooners&quot; get out there too, and get out in front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the slower standard colonists, then there may not be much the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; official agency can do to stop them or punish them.  By the time the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colonist &quot;police&quot; arrive, the sooners are off to the next place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Assuming the policing agency, assuming one was needed, and was only
<br>
technological equal to the sooners rather than enough superior to set up
<br>
barriers that would stop sooners from encroaching.  Suppose, for
<br>
instance, that there is a sort of Vingean relative slowness bubble
<br>
around us until we seem mature enough to venture out into the broader
<br>
universe.  The bubble would make operations unprofitable for those who
<br>
might be tempted to not respect the local nursery space.  But I would
<br>
actually suggest that any forces that may be have a mutual agreement to
<br>
abide by certain rules and do not let new races out and about until they
<br>
make the same agreement and can be trusted to keep it.    I would expect
<br>
much more advanced species to have much more advanced ways of sealing
<br>
such a mutual agreement than simple brute force and hauling one another
<br>
before magistrates. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The key technology that would make a difference would be an ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to project force out farther and faster than reproducing colonists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could move.  But it is hard to imagine such a technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, if the colonies are moving at less than c and there is a means of
<br>
communication at c or better and policing mechanisms have been deployed
<br>
throughout the protected spaces (at least), then it is not that terribly
<br>
difficult.  Forget the communication.  Just have local intelligence
<br>
mechanisms on guard duty that are sufficiently powerful to deter any
<br>
foolish enough to break the agreements.
