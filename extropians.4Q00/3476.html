<p>Sorry Harvey, I just don't accept claims of widespread rural bigotry at
<br>
the level you claim, except possibly in the rural South or other areas
<br>
of strong Klan influence (if they communities you speak of were such,
<br>
then I suppose that helps explain it). Working in Vermont as I do, with
<br>
the current Civil Union controversy raging, it has turned out that all
<br>
of the overt 'hate' crimes committed here since the 'Take Back Vermont'
<br>
grassroots campaign began were actually committed by gays trying to gain
<br>
sympathy. A gay priest, for example, torched his own car in a ploy to
<br>
enrage the community against conservative opposition, and it was a few
<br>
Darthmouth students who painted swastikas on a few street signs in
<br>
Norwich as a ploy to promote a 'diversity celebration' they had planned.
<br>
I know its rather stereotypical of me to say this, but these individuals
<br>
are only reinforcing prejudices about 'drama queens', and are doing
<br>
their cause no good.
