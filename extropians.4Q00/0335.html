<p>Already? Darn, ran out of meds, again.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; such that you are rationalizing away your responsibility. Shades of the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'm honoured by the comparison with those great men (thankfully, you
<br>
didn't compare me with Edward Teller) attempting to preempt Nazi
<br>
Germany in the race to the nuke, but what exactly is it that you're
<br>
accusing me of?
<br>
<p>As I said, I think having molecular circuitry is crucial for uploads,
<br>
and uploads are supposed to save our all asses, by making us
<br>
competitive with golems. I've given my arguments why I think this is
<br>
true. I'm not responsible what Eliezer's going to do with the stuff,
<br>
that's why he's on *my* 'gene's Very Own Extremely Evil People list.
<br>
<p>I've also made a ;) argument, telling don't hit me, I'm not the one.
<br>
(And yeah: you think that's air you're breathing?!)
<br>
<p>If I can't even make a joke in an argument, I think the matters have
<br>
gone way too far. I hope this is not giving us a taste how conflicts
<br>
between differing camps are conducted, 'cause then I'm moving in into
<br>
one of those abandoned missile silos, with a load of supplies to last
<br>
a man-century.
