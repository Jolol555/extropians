<p><em>&gt; &gt;  Today transhumanism should be out of the basement but it isn't.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;I disagree.  We're seeing transhumanist ideas discussed in wider and wider
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fora, although usually without the label &quot;transhumanism&quot; or &quot;extropian&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Kurzweil's book and Jaron Lanier's article in Edge.org are good examples).
</em><br>
<p>One thing that I've noticed is that Extropian ideas are showing up, more and 
<br>
more, in science fiction, even though many of the commentaters of SF don't 
<br>
seem to be aware of this and are a bit confused by it.
<br>
<p>Consider a statement, in a recent interview, by Gardner Dozois (a very 
<br>
important editor of SF): &quot;It seems fairly clear, using 20/20 hindsight, that 
<br>
the biggest trends of the '90s were parallel booms in the hard-science 
<br>
story, updated and reinvented to better suit the tastes of the time, and in 
<br>
modern space opera, also updated and reinvented to better suit the tastes of 
<br>
the time. We're talking now about the work of people like Greg Egan, Gregory 
<br>
Benford, Paul J. McAuley, Vernor Vinge, Greg Bear, Stephen Baxter, Michael 
<br>
Swanwick, Gwyneth Jones, Brian Stableford, Bruce Sterling, Pat Cadigan, Iain 
<br>
Banks, Peter Hamilton and a number of others; some of the newer writers I 
<br>
just mentioned, such as David Marusek and Alastair Reynolds, would clearly 
<br>
fit comfortably in here as well. Many of the same players have produced work 
<br>
in both these areas, but they don't quite overlap exactly; Greg Egan, for 
<br>
instance, is perhaps the foremost new practitioner of the modern 
<br>
hard-science story, but he doesn't write space opera, nor does Brian 
<br>
Stableford (although, interestingly enough, he used to); where people like 
<br>
Iain Banks or Peter Hamilton don't write hard-science stories. You do have 
<br>
people like Paul J. McAuley and Stephen Baxter, though, who seem equally 
<br>
fluent in both areas, and move freely from one to the other as they choose.&quot;
<br>
<p>Note that he's not quite sure how to catagorize the writing of these 
<br>
authors, but that he definitely sees some ambiguous commonality.  I've read 
<br>
a lot of work by most of the writers he mentions I can assure you that a lot 
<br>
of these folks (as well as others he didn't mention just as James Reed and 
<br>
Ken MacLeod) are either transhumanists (e.g., Egan), Extropian sympathizers 
<br>
(e.g., Vinge), or are, at the least, very familiar with the ideas that 
<br>
Extropians have been batting around, either directly or through osmosis.  
<br>
Indeed, I've been seeing so many Extropianist themes showing up in short 
<br>
stories (which are, as always, the cutting edge of the genre) that I feel 
<br>
that Extropian fiction is now a legitimate sub-genre.
<br>
<p>One theme in particular that's been cropping up a lot is that of 
<br>
transhumanism.  Most specifically, the notion that people not only can or 
<br>
will transcend their humanity, but that this may (or even definitely will) 
<br>
be a *good* thing.  This is in sharp contrast to the pervasive fear of the 
<br>
idea (to say nothing of the obnoxious antrocentricism exhibited by 
<br>
characters such as Star Trek's Data who want to become *human* because, well 
<br>
shucks, ain't that the best thing to be?) that has dominated the genre in 
<br>
the past.
<br>
<p>As such, I would suggest that the memes are definitely out there and that 
<br>
they are finding an audience.  If one wanted to put a snooty, postmodernist 
<br>
take on it (and I may as well get *some* use out of my English degree :-), 
<br>
one could say that the Promethean metaphor is in ascension while the 
<br>
Frankenstein metaphor is in decline.
