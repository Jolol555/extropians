</em><br>
<p>In fact, let me amplify on that last part.  Buying property is not a risk-free
<br>
activity.  Bars open and bars close.  Famous theaters move away and famous
<br>
theaters move in.  Bus routes change and train stations open.  It's only
<br>
natural that property owners should wish to control events - help bars close,
<br>
stop bars from opening, complain when bus routes change (the more so as it's a
<br>
public, governmental function), even sign petitions to stop theaters from
<br>
moving away.  Maybe they'll open up a plague house next door that'll cut
<br>
property prices in half, and maybe the new megamall will open three doors away
<br>
and your prices will shoot up by a factor of ten.  The Libertarian credo is
<br>
that, even though it may be to the benefit of individuals to try and exert
<br>
control in specific cases, in the end everyone loses once the government gets
<br>
involved.  Looking over the interaction of people building and owning
<br>
buildings, what I see is a free economy that should be protected from
<br>
government interference, even if some people lose on individual transactions. 
<br>
That's why I have a strong a priori prejudice towards choice A in situations
<br>
like these - though the real answer depends on who owns the noise spectrum.
