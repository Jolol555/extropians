[Non-member submission]
<br>
<p>Some of you may have noticed the lack of my unsettling intrusions, 
<br>
insightfull commentaries, sexist monologues, boring diatribes, or whatever 
<br>
category you may have chosen or not.  Briefly, Hotmail screwed up my mail 
<br>
during their &quot;upgrade.&quot;  Note that Hotmail is now owned by 
<br>
MicroSloth.  (&quot;Oh no-o-o, Mr. Bill!)  Thus, upgrades are a time to wish 
<br>
that prayer worked.
<br>
<p>Since I was no longer getting 95% of my incoming mail, I quickly signed up 
<br>
with Altavista's mail service, and unsubscribed from the Extropy email list 
<br>
to avoid further problems re Hotmail.  I found, meanwhile, that, except for 
<br>
a slight delay before the archives were posted, it is much, much faster and 
<br>
easier to peruse the archives than to try to handle it via email.
<br>
<p>Then I noticed two things: First, and this has yet to be explained, a fair 
<br>
number of my earlier posts were not in the archives. (!???)  Second, 
<br>
virtually none of the posts that I sent in after unsubscribing from the 
<br>
email list, which I spent so much time to get right, were posted.  The 
<br>
explanation which I received on that issue, after a couple of weeks, was 
<br>
that no one had time to manually check all the non-subscriber posts, so 
<br>
most of them are just dumped.
<br>
<p>One wonders how many posts from non-subscribers - I suspect Esther Dyson 
<br>
among them, for example, as she has occasionally posted to the list - who 
<br>
simply cannot afford to cull through hundreds of &quot;REs,&quot; often silly 
<br>
messages re gun control or whatever, and thus do not subscribe, are also 
<br>
simply dumped - a sure way to discourage further contribution.
<br>
<p>So, I resubsribed via my altavista email account, which I quickly 
<br>
discovered is a disaster, as altavista is even slower than hotmail when 
<br>
ones box starts getting full.  It took me over two hours just to delete the 
<br>
Extropy email for a few days and find my own personal mail!  Thus, I 
<br>
unsubscribed again.
<br>
<p>Anyway, this message is a test in part, as I have now been informed that an 
<br>
account has been set up in response to my request such that I can post 
<br>
without receiving the email.
<br>
<p>My question is: Why isn't this SOP?  Why not make this the FIRST option, 
<br>
not something available only by special request?  Most really productive 
<br>
and smart people simply don't have time to handle hundreds of mostly inane 
<br>
messages, which may be fun to a handful of the parties involved, but only 
<br>
clutter up the infospace for the rest of us.  I have found that using the 
<br>
archives has not only speeded up my access enormously, but also has 
<br>
seriously curtailed my impulse to jump in with an opinion on every topic.
<br>
<p>My suggestion, since this topic has also emerged recently in the form of a 
<br>
request for people to limit their postings, is to make non-email 
<br>
subscription the standard, with the email optional.
<br>
<p>A second suggestion, since I have been using the archives, is to make them 
<br>
more user friendly.  For instance, the search engine DOES NOT WORK!  I 
<br>
tried searching for my own name, using various options, and got all kinds 
<br>
of stuff with no connection, while most of my posts never came up at all.
<br>
<p>A good search engine that indexed threads, for example, so that the user 
<br>
could locate all the threads on a topic and then look at all the original 
<br>
messages first, for example - not the REs - would be very helpful.
<br>
<p>Finally, and I'm sure that much more could be written on this topic, the 
<br>
archives should be downloadable, at least by subscribers.  Downloads from a 
<br>
search result would be optimum, I think.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, both I, and, I suspect, certain other list members have much 
<br>
enjoyed my vacation from the list.  There is an addictive quality to these 
<br>
things, which becomes visible perhaps only on its absense.
