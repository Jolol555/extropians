<em>&gt; You're making a mistake if you identify all of rationalism with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practice of *some* of the followers of Ayn Rand (generally the devotees of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the official Randians rather than the more open-system Kelly-style
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Objectivists). I agree that there are plenty of irrational rationalists. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see people preaching reason while being dogmatic and utterly blind to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own rationalizations and narrow perspectives. But that's certainly not true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of all Objectivists, and certainly not true of all rationalists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I forget the ifs ands and buts of it but Objectivism is not a form of
<br>
rationalism philosophically IIRC. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ayn Rand did not invent rationalism. Rejecting rationalism as a dogma
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of your views on Ayn Rand and some of her followers is unfair. Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear of Karl Popper? Or David Hume? Or [insert one of hundreds of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalists here]?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Popper and Hume made even worse mistakes.  Rand did not do at all badly
<br>
in many respects.  This little mealy mouth creature who calls himself
<br>
her &quot;heir&quot; is another matter entirely.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Ascending paradigms are those which revolve around spirit and deny matter-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;descending paradigms are those which revolve around matter and reject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;spirit.  I'm borrowing this from Ken Wilber.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ken WIlber made some very interesting assertions and laid some
<br>
interesting theories here and there but he didn't go very far beyond
<br>
that.  And there are gaping holes in his writings that were badly
<br>
glossed over.  Matter vs. Spirit  is another silly dichotomy.  As Gilder
<br>
(who now and then says something quite good) pointed out quite some time
<br>
ago, you could see the transformation of our society to center on
<br>
information and the continual miniturization of the means of doing work
<br>
(micro-&gt;nano) and, with nanotech, everything being controlled by
<br>
consciousness right down to individual molecules and atoms - all of this
<br>
can be seen as very much (if you will) a &quot;spiritualization&quot; of matter. 
<br>
This has led me to the modern aphorism:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The ultimate spiritualization of Matter IS the ultimate
<br>
materialization of Spirit.&quot;
<br>
<p>Think about it.  It is a quite interesting point of unification along
<br>
two major lines of human striving to transcend their limitations. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; That's a useless distinction then. If you see no reason to believe in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence of &quot;spirit&quot; (in a supernatural sense) then the distinction cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even be made. Most extropians do not believe in spirits, though they may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite spiritual in the sense of having ideals, lofty goals, and a strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of meaning and purpose. Our views do not revolve around matter but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around values and goals. (We inhabit material bodies but that doesn't mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our paradigm revolves around matter. It actually revolves around much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher-level abstractions.) Wilbur's distinction just cannot be made to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply to such views. It's like trying to fit most of our political views
</em><br>
<em>&gt; onto the silly one-dimensional left-right spectrum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Substitute transcendent consciousnes (transcendent of current
<br>
limitations continuously) for spirit if you will.  Then tell me being
<br>
extropian is not profoundly spiritual.  It is the ultimate triumph of
<br>
spirit (consciousness) over limitations (all the way to the maximum
<br>
tinkering in the works that may someday be possible.  all the way to
<br>
Omega Point perhaps).
