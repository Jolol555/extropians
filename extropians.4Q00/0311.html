<p>
Just to throw in my two cents on this...
<br>
<p>Such a thing is definitely possible - some of our experiments with other
<br>
primates have shown that we may yet be able to teach them without any 
<br>
genetic tinkering.  Add in the genetic component, and we should be able to
<br>
re-implement the changes evolution made to come up with us, at least in 
<br>
terms of sentience and intelligence.
<br>
<p>Uplifting other species may prove more difficult, but Brin's examples of
<br>
dolphins, chimpanzees, and gorillas all make sense - they seem to have the 
<br>
capabilities as-is. SOme recent studies seem to indicate that we are engaging
<br>
in a wholesale, haphazard uplift of raccoons (They have grown in size and 
<br>
intelligence with the more puzzles we throw at them.  I have some anecdotes
<br>
that are good examples, but they're more off-topic for this).  The question 
<br>
is, where would we stop?  Would we want to uplift bears, wolves, cougars,
<br>
or similar?  I think the answer is, quite simply, if we start we'll find it 
<br>
almost impossible to stop.
<br>
<p>It's the getting started that's the problem.  Ethicists are already asking 
<br>
some annoying questions about our &quot;right&quot; to tinker with things like this,
<br>
and certain schools of religious thought would look upon this sort of work
<br>
as &quot;tinkering with God's creation&quot; or &quot;trying to engage in the one act still
<br>
sacred to the Creator - the creation of new, sentient life&quot;.  It would raise
<br>
all kinds of interesting and obnoxious questions about the soul, and would
<br>
result in a group of sentient beings that would have no unanswered questions 
<br>
about their Creators - they could ask us.  The backlash amongst the religious
<br>
elements of our society, especially those of the Judeo-Christian line, would
<br>
be intene.
<br>
<p>As for Moreaus, though, there is another possibility.  Most people have some
<br>
sort of idealized anthropomorphized view of themselves.  Consider this
<br>
question:  If you could take on the traits of any animal, what animal would it 
<br>
be?  we already are doing crude body modifications that are slowly reaching
<br>
this level - surgically implanted bone structures that look like horns, 
<br>
sculpted nails like claws, and certain hair grafts.  The idea of a physical
<br>
transformation to something of a half-animal, half-human form resonates with
<br>
some people on a very deep level.  THIS sort of Moreau I could see as being
<br>
not only possible, but most likely probable, given that it could be done 
<br>
through limited genetic modifications and lots of advanced structural 
<br>
surgery.
<br>
<p>Like those who engage in body modification today, it's quite likely that people
<br>
who engages in this sort of &quot;transformation&quot; would be ostrasized and shunned
<br>
by most people, forced into certain &quot;niche&quot; communities for employment, 
<br>
especially manual labor.  SInce such changes wouldn't be inheritable, it would 
<br>
be less likely to create a true &quot;underclass&quot; of Moreaus, the in-generation
<br>
effects would be fairly pronounced until they became generally accepted.
<br>
<p>Again, just a few thoughts on this.
<br>
