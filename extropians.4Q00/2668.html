Nicq-shades of the Buddha. Let me speak for the dear old ego and say that the 
<br>
personality (traits and memory) are what makes you, you! If these are 
<br>
permanently washed away from the Universe, then what you suggest is a kind of 
<br>
&quot;value-death&quot; for the Universe--to quote Philosopher from Guelph University, 
<br>
John Leslie. The cosmos becomes utterly meaningless, because not only you, 
<br>
but all the people you cared about, all the people they cared about, all the 
<br>
beauty of nature is vanished permanently. This seems to give annihilation a 
<br>
permanent win. This is what Neitzsche's Ubermann was all about, knowing that 
<br>
life is crap and still keeping one's &quot;nobility&quot;. Neitzsche also believed in 
<br>
palegenesia--that the same people would repeat the exact same events over and 
<br>
over again. This is also akin to the Stoics world view. Ultimately the 
<br>
universe dies, or life dies in it and it becomes an unaware commodity. My 
<br>
point is that one of the purposes of this list is to begin to tackle the 
<br>
problems of the human condition (there are many) and rectify them. No easy 
<br>
answers but from a cosmic time scale we may have a bit of time.

<p>&lt;&lt; Not quite.  You're still viewing your &quot;self&quot; as a self-contained entity, 
<br>
not
<br>
&nbsp;as the totality of existence.  So far, no one has explained why the &quot;self&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;exists- other than in a physicalist manner which really doesn't explain
<br>
&nbsp;anything, because it still doesn't explain the idea of self-in-experience
<br>
&nbsp;(in other words, why am I me and why am I not you... or why am I not aware
<br>
&nbsp;of everything, because I am part of everything).  The only reason we think
<br>
&nbsp;we are self contained is because of the limits of our nerve endings- as
<br>
&nbsp;Wilber pointed out, our consciousness extends much further.  The brain is
<br>
&nbsp;not a machine that exists outside the universe- it is constantly reacting to
<br>
&nbsp;the gravitational effects of countless bodies throughout the universe, and
<br>
&nbsp;ends up being something of a conveyance for thought that takes place as the
<br>
&nbsp;motions of innumerable bodies throughout the universe.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Will you be self-aware when you die?  No.
<br>
&nbsp;Is there a soul?  No.
<br>
&nbsp;Will we reincarnate? Not in totality- but to some extent, the patterns may
<br>
&nbsp;pass on.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;However, the movements still take place.  The universe goes on, and life
<br>
&nbsp;continues.  The ego is the only thing that has vanished.
