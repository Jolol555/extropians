And THIS is exactly why libertarians won't ever be a real force in American
<br>
politics. Almost universally every libertarian I know (including me, most of the
<br>
time) comes off as a self-righteous know-it-all, acting as though everyone else
<br>
is beneath them. We all seem to say &quot;If only they could see what we see, but
<br>
they're not bright enough, so we'll have to make them do it anyway.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From: Chris Russo &lt;<a href="mailto:extropy@russo.org?Subject=Re:%20Random%20comments%20on%20some%20late%20discussions.&In-Reply-To=&lt;852569AC.0062FED2.00@notes.cbis.com&gt;">extropy@russo.org</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Because people are really really really stupid.
</em><br>
<p>A lot of the people I know don't like the libertarian philosophy, no matter how
<br>
well you explain it. Why? They don't value the same things we do. (Wholly aside
<br>
from the things in the last paragraph) Conservatives value order and/or faith
<br>
more than individualism, liberals value fairness, socialists value equality of
<br>
outcome, etc. Values underlie HOW we reason, by causing us to choose differents
<br>
facts, lines of thinking, or even different outcomes. We're never going to get
<br>
what we want without force, thus negating everything we value.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't expect people to change their minds because you think something
<br>
is logical, if they value something else more. Telling a mother receiving ADC
<br>
she'll be better off without the money she uses to feed her children after the
<br>
economy is freed up is NOT going to work. Telling corporations they'll have to
<br>
work in a totally free-market is not going to get it done.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoting favorite libertarian authors doesn't help, since people have either
<br>
never heard of them (Hayek, Mises) or if they have, they usually are quoted by
<br>
people who sound like fundamentalists (this happens to me when people quote
<br>
Rand, and I have always liked her work. Quoting what she says as a weapon, as a
<br>
lot of objectivists I've known do, marks you as a nut, largely.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing which happens is that anyone who isn't &quot;100%&quot; libertarian is
<br>
castigated for lack of purity, no matter what kind of person they are, no matter
<br>
how much they could have helped us win some of what we want. I've seen this over
<br>
and over, and the attitude of the people doing the flaming is &quot;good riddance&quot;.
<br>
Well, that's great, but there are so few people who will pay us any attention
<br>
now, we can't really afford to piss them off.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Libertarians also take words and &quot;re-define&quot; them, so that a person using
<br>
normal language thinks they agree with us, when they don't. When they realize
<br>
this, it pisses them off. This isn't exactly a way to get what we want.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure I'm really a libertarian anymore, since so much of what they
<br>
seem to want is unrealistic. Maybe I'm wrong, I certainly hope so. Not all of
<br>
the people on this list are libertarians, which is good, but a large number seem
<br>
to be. So, how do we get from here to there?
<br>
I know I'm going to get flamed for this, but so be it. Maybe I'll learn
<br>
something.
<br>
Sorry for the somewhat dis-ordered order.
<br>
Mike
