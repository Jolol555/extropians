</em><br>
<p>I admit I'm a bid superstitious on this topic. John and I have gone back
<br>
and forth on this for years. John's concept of the destructive scan
<br>
producing a copy that is indistinguishable from the original avoids what
<br>
happens when the original is not, in fact, destroyed during a scan, so
<br>
while the copy may be as good as the 'real thing', there is something
<br>
basically counter-intuitive to the idea that my uploaded copy is
<br>
indistinguishable from ME, or is me for all practical purposes. 
<br>
<p>The way I get around the squeamishness of blithely zapping the original,
<br>
or having to deal with leftovers is to embrace the 'soft upload' as the
<br>
only true 'transfer of conciousness', where the individual augments
<br>
their mind with artificial components to such a degree that eventually
<br>
the biological component dies but is not missed by the concious entity.
<br>
<p>It is tantamount to taking a '57 Chevy and slowly replacing parts: the
<br>
alternator, the points, the carb, the muffler, the head, etc. At some
<br>
point in the future, there will be no original parts on it, but its
<br>
history, its provenance, makes it a superior vehicle to one that has
<br>
been reproduced by some CAD/CAM system from scans of original parts.
<br>
With a body infested with nanites whose job is the slow replacement of
<br>
dying neurons with artificial substitutes is analogous to this. 
<br>
<p>I can much easier accept that the resulting entity eventually living
<br>
totally on an artificial substrate is a 'human' that is aware than a
<br>
mere scanned upload. 
<br>
<p>Do I think they are inferior to soft uploads? Not necessarily. How would
<br>
they be any different from an AI grown from scratch on artificial
<br>
substrates? Likely little except the AI would likely have far less junk
<br>
code involved. I am just not sure if following that route would retain
<br>
the ME-ness of ME. 
<br>
<p>This is likely a significant solipsistic conceptual stumbling block, one
<br>
that is entirely 'in my head'. I don't deny it. This is likely true.
<br>
However, anything that would make me comfortable going through such a
<br>
transition ought to be attempted, if only to make such a procedure more
<br>
acceptable to the population at large, and to make the resulting
<br>
entities more likely to be treated as 'human' by the rest of humanity.
<br>
This would likely help reduce greatly the amount of support for luddites
<br>
who would oppose granting civil rights to such entities, which can only
<br>
be to the good.
