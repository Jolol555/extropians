</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think you may need to refine the term &quot;intelligent life&quot; a bit.
</em><br>
<p>Yes and no. No in the sense that for this particular application I don't 
<br>
think it makes much difference how you define an &quot;observer&quot;, namely if you 
<br>
think that the real difficulty was getting to complex organisms (like 
<br>
vertebrae) and that the step from there to human-level intelligence was 
<br>
*relatively* easy. But yes in the sense that there are many other cases 
<br>
where how you define &quot;observer&quot; will make a big difference to what results 
<br>
you get when trying to account for observational selection effects. The 
<br>
more general problem here is how to define the reference class. (Remember, 
<br>
the Self-Sampling Assumption says you should think of yourself as a random 
<br>
sample from all observers in your reference class, so you need to know what 
<br>
that class is.) The precise solution to this is not currently known (though 
<br>
I have some ideas that I haven't yet articulated that possibly might solve 
<br>
this.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;For example, we can compare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the time it actually took for intelligent life to evolve and compare that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to the time that was available (an upper bound on which is given by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;time when the sun engulfs the earth in about five billion years).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hsssss...  The sun engulfing the planet is a very poor limit unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you are taking a very anthropic view of what &quot;life&quot; must look like.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The habitable water zones shrink as the stars get smaller (K &amp; M
</em><br>
<em>&gt;class), but they are much more numerous and live much longer.  Free-formed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or wandering planets (flung out of solar systems by gravitational sling-shots)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could still evolve life based on energy from gravitational contraction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or radioactive decay if they formed in regions significantly enriched
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by SN explosions with radioactive elements.  While the matter density
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of gas clouds is low, we know they are seedded with the building
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blocks of life, have energy sources in nearby stars and have very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;large (&gt;&gt; solar) masses (which may offset their low density).
</em><br>
<p>I'm talking about the cut-off for the interval during which our earth could 
<br>
evolve life. Presumably you agree that that is impossible after earth has 
<br>
been evaporated and been absorbed by a red giant, don't you agree? (If 
<br>
posthumans were to construct some kind of hardy life form that could 
<br>
continue to evolve after that point, this obviously doesn't count, since 
<br>
we're talking about the first point when intelligent life evolved, not how 
<br>
long is can survive.)
<br>
<p>As for the other life forms you mention, although they would be irrelevant 
<br>
to the point I'm making, I also happen to think that they are even more 
<br>
extremely improbable. If evolution of intelligent life is so hard even on a 
<br>
nice planet like earth, then I can see no reason to think that it is a 
<br>
frequent event in less hospitable environments. But that's a sidetrack.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Going back as far as Shklovsky and Sagan, there are concepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of civilizations advanced only slightly beyond ours, to reengineer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their star to extend its longevity.  There are also concepts for moving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the planet.  So, any limits on the maximum longevity of technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civilizations are very questionable.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but that's irrelevant for the point I was making (see above). To 
<br>
clarify, the argument is this: Trace back to the starting point of our line 
<br>
of intelligent life. It happened apprx 4.5 billion years after the Earth 
<br>
became habitable. Also, we know it couldn't have happened later than after 
<br>
apprx 10 billion years. Now, if there were many critical steps in the 
<br>
evolution of intelligent life, then one should have expected it to have 
<br>
appeared closer to the cut-off than it did. (This can be shown 
<br>
mathematically - see e.g. Robin's paper <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/hardstep.ps">http://hanson.gmu.edu/hardstep.ps</a>.) 
<br>
Conclusion: probably, there were not very many critical steps. (If we 
<br>
assume that the real cut-off was earlier than 10 billion years, which it 
<br>
might be because of climate change, then there could be more critical 
<br>
steps. You need to assume either the number of critical steps or the true 
<br>
cut-off time to be able to estimate the other.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;record of?  On other planets, these could have taken faster
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(or slower) approaches to the development of complex multi-cellular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forms.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. That's a separate issue.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;..., except that all the evidence we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;have is perfectly consistent with the hypothesis that it is extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;difficult for intelligent life to evolve. This is also consistent with (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in my opinion is the most probable explanation of) the absence of any signs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of extraterrestrial intelligence (the Fermi paradox).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is also a reasonable amount of evidence (IMO) to suggest that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there is no Fermi Paradox.  We are almost completely lacking in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ability to detect &quot;life&quot; at a distance, especially life at the limits
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of physical laws.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that there is no Fermi &quot;Paradox&quot;. A paradox is supposed to be where 
<br>
there are compelling arguments for each of two incompatible claims. But 
<br>
there is no compelling argument why life should be common in the universe. 
<br>
I think there are some semi-compelling arguments for thinking that if 
<br>
space-travelling life were common, it would have been here by now, but 
<br>
that's been debated here a lot quite recently so let's not go into that at 
<br>
this point.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There are a lot more PhD thesis that need to be written about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the possible end-points for technological civilizations and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we might recognize them.
</em><br>
<p>That could be interesting. Unfortunately, it's not a PhD topic that many 
<br>
departments would encourage.
