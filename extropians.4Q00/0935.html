</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I find it odd that so many people in the world think that living is the most

</em><br>
<p>I hear this from people, but they don't seem to understand the reason for my
<br>
statement. A person who desires to remain free in the face of one who would
<br>
enslave him/her must be prepared to deprive the opressor from any profit from
<br>
their actions (i.e. profit is your slave labor), as well as to add significant
<br>
risk to the actions of the opressor by the threat of violent resistance to
<br>
becoming enslaved. Smart opressors can make the cost/benefit analysis and back
<br>
down from their opression, and go looking for an easier mark. This is why peace
<br>
through strength works and appeasement does not (as has been so ably
<br>
demonstrated by history.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, whether or not you guys or some SI holding me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; captive thinks escape or hope are possible, I can still contemplate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; escape and hope. If my faculties for thinking, remembering, or feeling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything other than the pain to which I am being subjected are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temporarily switched off, there is still the faintest ghost of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility that some turn of events will get those faculties switched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back on[1]. If they are permanently, irrevocably switched of... i.e.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroyed, making me nothing more than a pain-bot, then I suppose I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be indifferent to being dead because as a sentience that limited I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already be dead for practical purposes. So, I suppose that if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permanently destroy enough of my brain you'll eventually get me to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; okay with getting killed... but that will happen a long time after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you've already gotten me to be okay with the idea that the sun being
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The Jews in europe thought the same thing. Only a small fraction of them
<br>
survived. Appeasement and acquiescence does not work with bullies.
