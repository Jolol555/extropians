<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The mantra you mention is far from valueless to me. Please don't make me

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The problem with &quot;I am a member of a civilization&quot; is that it doesn't say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whether the civilization is good or bad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it is true that, taken by itself, then notion is so boiled down as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be too value free. How about &quot;I am a member of an increasingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enlightened planetary civilization&quot;? Welp, it sounds awful prissy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NWO; besides, the Nazis probably thought that too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brin doesn't want the Reichstag, he just wants a day a year and some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time once in a while spent on reflecting on how far we've come with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperfect systems we have. I do grant you that a new Goebbels, or even
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but Bellamy (the author of &quot;Looking Backward&quot;) seemed to have
<br>
similar sentiments, yet his book and other writings spawned Nationalist,
<br>
Socialist, and National Socialist movements around the world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Principles *are* important. One principle that's important is not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; burn the barn down while the horse is still inside.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't follow what that means in this context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's an old saw that cuts both ways. In this case, I meant that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premature polarization (enemy talk) can cost you. Brin might not be as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful to your goals as an enemy as he might be as a grudgingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respected gadfly with whom you have piquant disagreement.
</em><br>
<p>As opposed to say, Chomsky?
