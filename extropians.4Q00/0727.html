<em>&gt; Sure but dont worry about culture shocking Zubrin.  Hes been an

</em><br>
<p>I had a few beers with Zubrin at Case for Mars IV back in 1990, when he
<br>
unveiled Mars Direct.  My buddy Steve Jones (no relation) and I were
<br>
trading cab driving war stories when Bob chimed in with, &quot;I, too, once
<br>
drove a cab...&quot;  Bear in mind that Zubrin looks just like Danny Devito,
<br>
only taller ;)  Bob continued:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I picked up this guy at LaGuardia, wanted to go to a spiffy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;hotel in Manhattan.  He kept dropping hints about the movies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;he'd been in, but just to be difficult I refused to &quot;realize&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;who he was.  As I was dropping him off, he finally said, &quot;Don't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you know me? I'm Jose Ferrer!&quot;  So I replied, &quot;I'm sorry,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't follow Puerto Rican baseball...&quot;
<br>
<p>I like him, just for that.
