<em>&gt; &gt; The trouble with asserting rights as a kid (or as a parent, on behalf of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; children) is that after you've made a stink, you have to go back to the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; school, to the same teacher.  And won't they be glad to see you....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then again, American parents have the right to move their kids to Montana and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; home school them.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but is forcing your child to move to Montana with you kidnapping? No? Then
<br>
they have no rights separate from the authority of their parents.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The tough issue for me:  Kids come in all stripes and colors.  Some are mature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and responsible, some are wild animals, and some are in-between.  From my POV,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the rules, particularly those in school, give adults broad discretion with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; little recourse and few repercussions for treating children in a way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be wholly unacceptable if applied to adults.  On the other hand, inner-city
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; teachers complain that, in this oversensitive, litigious age, they feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; powerless to deal with disciplinary problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think they should not only &quot;feel&quot; powerless to rule and control kids, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should *be* powerless, and let the kids evolve to autonomous responsibility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own device. That's probably the best way to provide an environment in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which a Siddhartha Gautama, Moses, Lao Tzu, Galileo, Socrates, et al., can grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up.
</em><br>
<p>I have no trouble with preventing teachers from forcing students to behave. I do
<br>
have trouble with not permitting teachers to expel troublesome students who are
<br>
violating the rights of everyone else to teach or be educated. When a parent
<br>
enrolls their child in school, they must accept responsibility for the behavior
<br>
of their child, or else give the school the authority commensurate with the
<br>
responsibility they are being asked to assume.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think children are the one of the hardest issue for a libertarian to grapple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with.  What rights should children have?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically, I think they should have the right to think for themselves, and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose whatever philosophy (philosopher, science, school of thought, etc.) suits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them best, regardless of the personal opinions of parents and teachers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Where do the rights of a parent end?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Parents rights ought to end where children's rights begin, IMO.
</em><br>
<p>Funny. And they are?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What right does the rest of society have to interfere with how I raise my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If your child becomes a serial killer, society has the right not only to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interfere, but also to hold you responsible. This kind of policy would have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; added benefit of discouraging many people from becoming parents, thereby helping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to alleviate the overpopulation problem. (All social problems derive directly or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indirectly from overpopulation.)
</em><br>
<p>If a society prevents parents from taking action to prevent their children from
<br>
becoming serial killers, the it is on the head of society, not the parents.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Should the rights be age-based, or is there a reasonable way to assess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence, maturity, and judgment?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd say children (and everyone, for that matter) should be evaluated on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basis of their actions, their behavior, and their social conduct, rather than on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the basis of age or whatever psychotropic substances they choose to put into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their bodies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The Libertarian Party platform takes a stab at it, but some of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conclusions seem absurd.  They feel that &quot;children always have the right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; establish their maturity by assuming administration and protection of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; own rights, ending dependency upon their parents or other guardians, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assuming all responsibilities of adulthood.&quot;  Sure....  How about three-year-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; olds who don't want to take a nap?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you focus on waking the 3-year-old from its naps at a regular and specified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times instead of trying to make them take a nap at a specific time, this problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaporates. Kids will go to sleep when they get sleepy enough. When kids get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mature enough to object to being awakened at a particular time (selected by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parent or caretaker), then kids can decide for themselves what time to begin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their naps.
</em><br>
<p>Starting kids on a regimen from infancy does wonders for their emotional
<br>
stability (it works with pets too). Try feeding your pet from puppyhood at the
<br>
exact time every day. They do get to know when they are supposed to be fed.
<br>
Don't do so, and they will want to eat at any time, and are far more bothersome
<br>
on a consistent basis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Animal rights are also hard.  Why is it a property crime to kill Koko, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gorilla with an IQ of 70, when it's murder to kill a human with an IQ of 70?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given today's atmosphere of animal rights versus human rights, I'd guess it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be easier to kill a retarded human than to kill a healthy gorilla. As for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws which pertain to this comparison, remember that the 70 IQ human probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has parents capable of litigation, but the gorilla does not. The old saw still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rings true, &quot;It's not what you know that counts, but who you know.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>And if you can pay for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We already have a system of fractional civil rights -- certain rights for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; adult citizens vs. felons vs. children vs. non-citizens vs. retarded -- why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not extend it to non-humans?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd be more in favor of moving in the opposite direction on this. Instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extending the concept of rights to non-humans, why not give rights only to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who demonstrate that they know what to do with them?
</em><br>
<p>Ah, a meritocracy. Something I've often speculated about, but most people tend
<br>
to be of the opinion that a meritocracy is fascistic (mainly because they fear
<br>
they themselves will not qualify).
