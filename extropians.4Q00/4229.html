<p><em>&gt;I don't want to get drawn into politics, because both major
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parties are flawed.  However, I will comment on the creation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Internet. As much as Gore-bashers will hate it:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Congressman Al Gore was one of the leading proponents of the bill
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that legalized public access to the Internet.  Before this bill 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;passed, the Internet was limited to military and university access
</em><br>
<em>&gt;under government programs.  Gore specifically called this &quot;the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Information Superhighway&quot; to parallel a similar bill his father
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had passed which created the Interstate Superhighway system.  As
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much as  his father created the Interstate Highway system, Al Gore
</em><br>
<em>&gt;created the public Internet system in America.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;It was an obvious idea that would have happened no matter what,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but Al Gore did bring the Internet to the American public.
</em><br>
<p>I have had no luck finding any reference to the bill you speak of,
<br>
please provide a reference.
<br>
<p>I remember things very differently, although I do remember Al being
<br>
an advocate of a government led &quot;Information Superhighway which of
<br>
course was never built.
