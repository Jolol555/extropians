J R's message seems to be intentionally baiting, but I'll give it a go
<br>
anyway.

<em>&gt; Yes, the list is about the same as ever. Same old topics, same old complaints,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same old... same old. Interesting that people who engage a discussion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accelerating change (of the extropic kind) do not themselves seem to change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their minds, their opinions, their politics, their attitudes, or their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical positions.
</em><br>
<p>Speak for yourself, J R. I've changed all of those quite dramatically over
<br>
the years, and I remain openminded and ready for more change.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... Others realize that, due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their economic situation and the fact they are past their prime, they don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stand a chance of joining the singularity clique.
</em><br>
<p>They may *believe* that, but they can't *realize* it until it's true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anti-geezer sentiments run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high among young turks (although you may not be as sensitive to this issue as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of us). Sure, geezers want to &quot;rise to the heavens&quot; ...the problem relates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to being tied down by decades of psychic baggage and an unattractive persona.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who would we rather recruit, a bevy of nubile young extro-girls, or some lame
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old duck who can't even learn computer languages, but who still wants to join
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the party? (Hint: the geezers can't even make it to the party.)
</em><br>
<p>Why can't the &quot;geezers&quot; &quot;make it to the party&quot;? I might be a geezer,
<br>
depending on your definition of geezer, but personally I wouldn't exclude
<br>
anyone based on their age or their ability to learn a programming language.
<br>
A population consisting solely of young nerds doesn't sound terribly
<br>
interesting to me. I prefer a wider range of backgrounds, experiences,
<br>
abilities, and interests.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; .., I know &gt;H AI doesn't want an old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fart like me around on its honeymoon. &lt;gag me with a virtual spoon&gt;
</em><br>
<p>How can you *know* what a nonexistent entity wants?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... The more I think about it, the more I suspect Sasha had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right idea.
</em><br>
<p>I know Sasha died, but I missed the discussion about it. You seem to be
<br>
implying that he killed himself. I don't see anything Extropic about suicide.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When faced with years and years of toil to earn enough capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to freely join technological singularity, it seems more reasonable, rational,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and yes, responsible to simply opt out.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds more like a cop out than an opt out. Suit yourself, but don't think
<br>
you're doing anyone a favor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... And look what's going on in the Middle East today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's only depressing if you plan to be around for more than a few more years.
</em><br>
<p>It's also depressing if you've giving up on believing that things can be
<br>
better and that you might possibly live to see it happen.
<br>
