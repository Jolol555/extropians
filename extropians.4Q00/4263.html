<em>&gt; Gore is supposed to be a liberal arts graduate of Harvard, where one

<p>You, maybe.  I can see quite easily how one individual could go through

such a cirriculum, or any broad cirriculum, without having heard of any

given individual (aside from pop culture ones like Einstein, Newton,

and Shakespear).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and thus its unreasonable

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; For those still not convinced that Al Gore is a liar, gander at this:

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; taking of credit again...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;  Al Gore said (in his CONCESSION speech, no less): As for the battle

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;  This was really said by Edwin Markham, in Victory in Defeat: &quot;Defeat

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So his father was quoting Markham, directly or indirectly.  I fail to
