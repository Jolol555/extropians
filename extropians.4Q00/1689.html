<em>&gt; I'm going to recommend that everyone on this list who is in

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Self-defense is one of about fifteen things that I think are

</em><br>
<p>Well, you made a good case for self-defense.  What are the other fourteen? 
<br>
(I'm not requesting a series of fourteen posts, I just want the list off the
<br>
top of your head.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, I don't think submachine gun is the first and best weapon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for you to learn but this course is free and other courses are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $500 and up.
</em><br>
<p>Rumor has it that some modern video games with simulated recoil on the guns
<br>
are actually quite effective training simulations, though you do have to
<br>
actually shoot a real gun at some point to finalize the training.  Can anyone
<br>
personally attest to this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hear arguments on either side but for now I will go with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea that the second amendment is a good idea and was put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there for a reason.
</em><br>
<p>The US population exists at the sufferance of the US military until such time
<br>
as the average Joe owns a tank and a fighter jet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another consideration is that nanotech and AI may eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the relevance of firearms.  That may be true one of these days
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but we are not there now.  We may someday live in utopia but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think there is a good chance that even after nanotech and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI we will still have a need for self-defense (perhaps even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more so).  Firearms may someday cease to be relevant but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combat mentality and concepts that you learn will still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply.
</em><br>
<p>No, actually the whole idea is that nanotech/AI/superintelligence scenario is
<br>
hopefully alien enough to eliminate even the need for self-defensive
<br>
thinking.  My own philosophy is that the future is so distant - not just in
<br>
terms of the environment, but in terms of who we will be - that the best
<br>
course is to try and be the most intense human you can be, here and now,
<br>
without moping too much over how much better you would be if you didn't have
<br>
to be human.  Arguably, firearms - and to an even greater extent, martial arts
<br>
- are a part of that.  The question, as always, is time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, I have a hunch.  It's just an idea and it may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply to everyone.  It's only something I feel and I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even sure it applies to me yet.  I think really knowing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can defend yourself is good for your energy level and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peace of mind.  It may be a biological effect of vigorous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and complex physical training. [...]  It may also be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that our brains also still respond to a pecking order system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which recognizes self-defense ability as a key dominance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trait.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, that's the one.
