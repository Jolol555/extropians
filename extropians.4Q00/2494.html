<p>
<em>&gt; Well, the easy answer is that we may put the finishing touches on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly seed AI which will set nanites to work for us.  But I'll do a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little more work, since I doubt that will satisfy you.
</em><br>
<p>I'm afraid of two possibilities-
<br>
<p>1. John Horgan's predictions regarding the end of scientific progress will
<br>
come true- and we will be unable to develop a Transhuman AI that may save us
<br>
and we will end up destroying our planet through war and environmental
<br>
damage.
<br>
<p>2. All these precautions and ideas for programming an ethical AI fail, and
<br>
we end up enslaved to a superconsious, survivalist computer that sees us as
<br>
little more than tools or servants.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, in case you weren't aware of it, Earth's resources can't be saved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forever, or even anything like forever.  The Earth will be swallowed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up by our dying sun billions of years from now; some large rock will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost certainly come flying at us out of the Oort cloud MUCH sooner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than that.
</em><br>
<p>Resource depletion will occur in my lifetime- the Earth being swallowed by
<br>
the sun will not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm sure I can never convince you that technological progress can make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us happier.  I will point out that we tend to be happier the wealthier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are, but this tendency is weak.  Granted, crime tends to be lower,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and, more generally, rich civilizations tend to be freer (on anybody's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms) than poor civilizations. * We also enjoy living longer, so long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as we don't run out of resources.  But happiness, while it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correlate with these things, is not captured in any of the above.
</em><br>
<p>My father is a multimillionaire, I attend a private college, I own an
<br>
expensive computer, expensive clothing, etc. etc.  Yet for some reason, I
<br>
feel incomplete.  I'm frequently depressed (I've been to two
<br>
psychotherapists- both say I'm fine and that I don't need medication), and
<br>
no matter how much I study, my life just feels more insignificant and
<br>
pointless.  Yet, at the same time, I see many people with far less material
<br>
wealth than I that seem far more satisfied, happy, and purposeful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * [The noble savage is not a myth, but he's hardly the norm.  Spare me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your hamlet of paradise story; *most* hamlets are hellholes.]
</em><br>
<p>I've never been a believer in the idea of the &quot;Noble Savage&quot;.  I believe
<br>
that any utopian political philosophy, whether it's that of Rousseau, Marx,
<br>
or Rand, can only lead to disaster.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for our arts, there the correlation to wealthier and more leisurely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies is far more obvious.  So, for those who WANT challenging and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engaging art, a high-technology society will be in the best way to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  If you want high art, you look to where there's the MOST art,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; namely rich time periods and cultures like the Renaissance, like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; musings of the idle priesthood in the East and in the West, like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20th century (more than all of these put together).
</em><br>
<p>True enough.  But tell me, what is art?  If you deny spirituality, you've
<br>
pretty much dissolved any meaning of the artistic experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By the way, try to be open minded to those working for profit.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are, in fact, working for the masses.  They're the ones finding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common bonds between their peers, sharing in their solidarity.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people prize them most of all.  That's why they keep paying.
</em><br>
<p>True as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Leisure is easier when you're richer.  Breaks come more naturally when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have time to spare.  The &quot;world&quot; of death looks less appealing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when the future has never looked so good, and you can be sure you'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be there to see it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Assuming we make it, of course.
</em><br>
<p>That's the catch.
<br>
<p>-Nicq
