From: &quot;Alex Future Bokov&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:alexboko@umich.edu?Subject=Re:%20A%20scary%20but%20HYPOTHETICAL%20question.&In-Reply-To=&lt;002401c0361b$6b7f5de0$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">alexboko@umich.edu</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt; One's effectiveness in accheiving overarching goals is sometimes hobbled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by self-preservation. If one knew that one was going to die soon (and for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever reason cryosyspension was not an option) then self-preservation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not longer influence one's decisions. How could one's strategy
</em><br>
change
<br>
<em>&gt; in response to this fact?
</em><br>
<p>This is a very interesting topic.  I think we discussed a variant of it on
<br>
the Transhuman list, god, who knows, like 3 years ago?
<br>
<p>I've arm-chair-theorized that the sense of impending mortality that grips
<br>
some of us as we age is directly responsible for galvanizing action.
<br>
<p>Actually, now that I think about it, this is not quite what you're talking
<br>
about.  There seem to be two complimentary issues:
<br>
<p>a.)  I don't want to die, so I'll make cautious (and limiting) decisions.
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>b.)  I could die soon, so it's time to get busy.
<br>
<p><p>I'm certain that overzealous self-preservative behavior can inhibit our
<br>
success-ability.  (Don't mind me, I'm just making up words here as I go
<br>
along.)
<br>
<p>Also, I think the philosophy of &quot;this day could be your last&quot; can be an
<br>
incredible motivator to drink deeply of the cup of life.
<br>
<p>So, curiously, it seems we need to relinquish some of our self-preservative
<br>
fear, while simultaneously enhancing our love for life.  Challengingly,
<br>
however, it appears that those two variables have an inverse relationship,
<br>
the more we love life, the less we want to lose it.
