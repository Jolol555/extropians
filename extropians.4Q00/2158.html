<em>&gt; The ironies involved here run deep.  With such a slim margin, a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred votes, there is *no question* that should Shrub win, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nadir is responsible.  So the far left has submarined the left.  Should

</em><br>
<p>Yes, but only if none of the other recounts (the GOP is pushing Iowa, Wisconsin,
<br>
and a few other close states to recount as well) flip as well. For example, if
<br>
Iowa flipped to the GOP, Bore wouldn't have enough electoral votes even if he
<br>
won Florida, while Oregon and New Mexico, as of yesterday, still had not
<br>
declared.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This experience has also placed a spotlight on the traditional dirty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tricks that surround every election, the only difference being this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one time, it really really matters.  Examples being: calls to known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democrats claiming to be the NAACP, endorsing Bush.  Another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be the gag email saying &quot;Democrats vote Tuesday,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Republicans vote Wednesday,&quot; or one of the very old standbys,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used traditionally in the south, is to have a police car park near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the polling place with the flashing lights going, which tends to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause a disproportionate number of Democrats to flee in terror.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Old tricks that never mean anything, until now.
</em><br>
<p>Technically, those avoiding polling places due to police presence are felon
<br>
fugitives, who shouldn't be voting anyways. Now what would be offensive is to
<br>
post some drug K-9 units at the doors, nailing anyone who smelled like drugs to
<br>
the dogs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find it astounding that the future of the country is now in the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Assuming they are still alive.
