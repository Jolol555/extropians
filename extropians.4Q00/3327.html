</em><br>
<p>Absolute disagreement, for precisely the reasons I have already cited.  Your
<br>
direct equation of &quot;power&quot; with &quot;freeness&quot; is simplisitic.  Does money
<br>
become more powerful if it's free?  Or it is made useful by the
<br>
control/limits we place on it?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Laws of scarcity.  Maybe you think it would be nice if every kid on the

that
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such a distribution wouldn't destroy an interesting market.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Irrelevant to the discussion.
</em><br>
<p>Only if you haven't been paying attention, or are unaware of the
<br>
transformation of creative energy into replicable data prevalent in today's
<br>
media environment.  If 'collectibility' is an asset worth protecting in the
<br>
material world, why isn't it in the electronic one?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A first edition is a material artifact.
<br>
<em>&gt; It is not information but a given physical embodiment in a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form produced at a particular time.  It cannot be duplicated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition.  But every kid can have a copy of the contents of that first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; edition.
</em><br>
<p>Yes Samantha, and think very carefully about what that &quot;definition&quot; is.
<br>
<p>Here, allow me: we have arbitrarily placed value upon a particular edition
<br>
of a magazine.  Although the technology exists to create a nearly exact (for
<br>
all practical intents and purposes) duplicate, we have passed laws against
<br>
any attempt to pass such a forgery off as a first edition.  Essentially we
<br>
have decided to outlaw the replication of a particular print run of material
<br>
goods, despite the fact that we could easily put an accurate forgery in the
<br>
hand of every elementary school kid on the planet.  We do that to
<br>
(arbitrarily) protect a market-- and as a result, there is one.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Yes there is a place for secrets - in war or the equivalent, one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal information and affairs.
</em><br>
<p>That's not the position of the post to which I replied:  Zero Powers wrote:
<br>
<p>&quot;I personally think those who demand the perpetuation of personal &quot;privacy&quot;
<br>
in a future that will live and breath on the unrestricted communication and
<br>
processing of ever increasing amounts of information are unknowing Luddites.
<br>
As I see it our ultimate &quot;purpose,&quot; if there is one, is to facillitate the
<br>
efficient storage, transmission and processing of data.  Everything at its
<br>
core is information and the more of it we can grasp and utilize, the better
<br>
off we will be.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But in peace and in non-personal
<br>
<em>&gt; information, the maximal power and good of each of us is highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dependent on the free flow of information.
</em><br>
<p>Again, total disagreement.  It's not just about free flow of information,
<br>
(isn't that obvious?) it's about access to the right information.  Further,
<br>
you specifically use the term 'each of us' referring to individuals: can't
<br>
you think of a few (thousand) ways in which the maximal power and good of an
<br>
individual is highly dependent on the controlled flow of information?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Your password is also not relevant.  This is a key designed to protect a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal asset.  It is no more information in the sense under discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than  your housekey is.
</em><br>
<p>Frankly, my housekey is also information Samantha.  And if you think
<br>
password information is not relevant to this discussion, then you better use
<br>
a different word than &quot;information.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Someone who prefers personal empowerment to the empowerment of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; collective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the world of information this boundary between you and them, or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precisely, this chopping up of the information commons into &quot;yours&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;theirs&quot; often harms each and every one of us.
</em><br>
<p>Who said it was an 'information commons?'  Your choice of words begs your
<br>
conclusion.
<br>
<p>Further, if you do not also hold that the 'chopping up of *goods and
<br>
services* into &quot;yours&quot; and &quot;theirs&quot; often harms each and every one of us,'
<br>
(a la Communism) then you'll need to effectively distinquish why we
<br>
shouldn't protect the information market (by showing how the differences are
<br>
significant.)  (Pretend like microchips built in 5 billion dollar factories
<br>
can be indefinitely replicated and transmitted-- that's a good jumping off
<br>
point.  Should we let people copy them, or should we secure them to the
<br>
benefit of the creators?)
<br>
<p>Damn, well this brings us around to a conversation that I -really- don't
<br>
want to have again-- you'll find reams of material on the subject in the
<br>
archives just prior to your joining the list if I recall correctly.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There is a vast difference between secure ownership of money or goods,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or even ownership of personal information crucial to privacy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claiming ownership of algorithms, data and so on.  Creative works are in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a slightly different category in my opinion although some of the changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brought about by the information age also change quite a bit about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music, literary works and so on and the rights and obligations of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved.
</em><br>
<p>Your so-called &quot;vast difference,&quot; is shrinking rapidly.  Good nanotech means
<br>
that it's ALL going to be software before long.  Everything is information--
<br>
its just that some of it is currently represented in a form over which we do
<br>
not yet have fine grained access.
