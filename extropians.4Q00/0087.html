<p><em>&gt; You are too kind, J.R.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I know. Some folks probably think I need to develop a tougher policy
<br>
toward anti-AI activists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While on vacation we visited my wife's grandmother.  I got in a discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with her on cryonics.  She is a coverted Seventh Day Adventist, having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been raised Mormon.  82 years old, mind in excellent shape, body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deteriorating.  We discussed cryonics, but I did not manage to get her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to sign on, even if I pay all expenses.  She would agree that *everything*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is waaaaay better now than in previous times in her life, and would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree that life will continue to get better and that science will continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to advance and even that cryonics might work.  But oddly enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she still didnt see it as compatible with her religion, even without a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear reason.  She just knew it was wrong.  {8-[
</em><br>
<p>Wouldn't it be weird if religionism disappears from the Earth because religious
<br>
people refuse to take advantage of new technology? Not so weird? My grandparents
<br>
died years ago, but their minds were never what I'd call in excellent shape
<br>
(since they never stopped believing in organized religion). I'll never forget
<br>
Jesse Ventura's famous quote: &quot;Organized religion is for weak minded people.&quot; Of
<br>
course they're not all weak minded. Eliezer S. Yudkowsky wants to kill everyone
<br>
who disagrees with him, and Eugene Lietl wants to put all AI workers in
<br>
concentration camps. Oh well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am reminded of those religious groups in India that believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cobras are sacred.  Many of these people die of cobra bites.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a clear case where a religious notion is harmful to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wellbeing of the mind in which it resides.  The anti-cryonics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grandmother would be another example.  spike
</em><br>
<p>What? Cobras are not sacred? Their venom produces suspended animation... for a
<br>
few hours. Then it ends animation forever. Gee, doesn't that warrant worshipping
<br>
them as sacred beings?
<br>
Yes, I know some religions keep their adherents in good health by proscribing
<br>
alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, etc. But do they really live longer, or does it
<br>
just seem longer?
<br>
<p>--J. R.
