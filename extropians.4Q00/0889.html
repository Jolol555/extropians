<p>Riiiiight. You believe what they say on their web site, why don't you
<br>
believe everything you read everywhere? Or do you? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eddie Eagle's message tends to glamorize gun ownership as a badge of adulthood and coolness, with a cartoon character to hook the message, much as Joe Camel did for tobacco.
</em><br>
<p>*Utter* ballocks, and it sounds as if you're parroting a party line.
<br>
Have you actually studied the materials? I have, and I've taught with
<br>
them, even though I am not and have never been a member of the NRA. It's
<br>
straightforward. Eddie Eagle says &quot;I care too much about you to see you
<br>
get hurt,&quot; and &quot;Stop. Don't touch. Leave the area. Tell an adult.&quot; to
<br>
the youngest kids. Older kids get a more sophisticated set of messages,
<br>
but they no more glamorize guns than does the Boy Scouts of America. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Kids should know not to touch guns, and to tell a responsible adult about guns they find, but a child safety program cannot substitute for adult responsibility, only supplement it, and I have concerns about a propagandized 'NRA Youth&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed. Have your concerns. By all means, keep the NRA honest about what
<br>
the program will and won't do; but kindly can the Joe Camel crap.  Me, I
<br>
have concerns about a propagandizing establishment that is the
<br>
overwhelming source of glamorizing gun *use*, not ownership, as a badge
<br>
of coolness and adulthood and whatnot. Such as a greaaaat many Hollywood
<br>
blockbusters.
<br>
<p>Such things are what adult responsibility *and* programs like Eddie
<br>
Eagle have to work *against*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;There are some little kids that were effectively killed recently by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;State of California's child safety law - when the naked guy with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;pitchfork broke in, the oldest child could not unlock Daddy's gun to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;attempt to defend her siblings. I hold the lawmakers responsible for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;kind of incident.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Stupid, well-meaning laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They'll most likely save a lot more lives than they lose; if people are gonna sue either way, there will be many more suits for many more deaths without such laws.
</em><br>
<p>I notice your total lack of compassionate response to the cited case.
<br>
Were the deaths in question _right_? Was Kitty Genovese's death any more
<br>
terrible?
<br>
<p>I think not.
