<p>&lt;&lt; &gt; Actually, the well-orchestrated campaign belongs to, and always has 
<br>
belonged to, the NRA, which is unparalleled in their foisting of 
<br>
lies-with-statistics (the baby-drowning-in-buckets urban legend being a prime 
<br>
example, which I have previously debunked), 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just thought some of you would like to help me start a collection of the 
<br>
Urban Legends that Anti Gun Zealots spread.  Has somebody got a real good 
<br>
version of the one that goes.  &quot;We don't want to ban all guns.  We only want 
<br>
to continue our one hundred year tradition of banning just one more gun.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh I also need a real good example of the anti gun zealot explaining what 
<br>
the gun crime statistics were before and after each gun law was passed.  That 
<br>
includes statistical proof of all the successes they have had over the past 
<br>
hundred years.  Chicago, New York and a number of other cities virtually 
<br>
outlaw all guns.  Can you get me the statistics before and after to show me 
<br>
how the anti gun laws reduced crime?
