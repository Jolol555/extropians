<em>&gt; It is a small percentage of killers who are psychotic in ways that are
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Growing up in a relatively abusive household, I can say unequivocally that
<br>
school was far worse than home. The torture of my peers at school for 12 years I
<br>
can only compare to POW camp, if I felt going home at the end of the day was
<br>
actually a relief. When the boys of Columbine committed their deeds, I
<br>
understood exactly why they did what they did, and was flabbergasted that
<br>
everyone was so intent on avoiding or ignoring these reasons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMO the laws today treat children as property - making it difficult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intervene in abuse situations. For purely selfish reasons (I'd like less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violent offenders and predators) I would prefer if children were NOT treated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as property but rather as human beings with rights.
</em><br>
<p>All children or just the one's on the football team?
