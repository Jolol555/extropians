<p><em>&gt; One point about the !Kung is that they are modern day hunter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gatherers, in a world generally no longer suitable for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practice. The land they are on is available because no-one else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants it; compared to the average hunter gatherer of the past, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably live a marginal and much more difficult existence.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps true, it could also be that the land itself is not that bad
<br>
(they seem to have some fairly reliable food sources the year around
<br>
regardless of weather, for example) but the conditions are unpleasant
<br>
enough to keep people away. Food is not the only factor in making land
<br>
more or less desirable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not advocating the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, however! Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless I can take a gameboy... and my notebook... and all my other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff with me. No, stuff it.
</em><br>
<p>My view too - I love civilisation with its complex, intertwined and
<br>
wonderous systems that make it possible for me to listen to Beethoven
<br>
while communicating with similar minds halfway across the world, eat
<br>
delicious fruits out of season and watch the snow settle outside my
<br>
window while I'm warm and cozy. That is something well worth
<br>
defending.
<br>
<p>Of course, a hypothetical future wearable and nanoassembler-equipped
<br>
hunter-gatherer (wanderer-assembler?) might be able to have all the
<br>
above without being tied to a single location, but it wouldn't change
<br>
the fact that he or she would likely be part of such a civilisation
<br>
network.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This thread has merely been there to question the assumption that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology has historically absolutely benefitted the peoples who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have adopted it. This situation is turning around today, I think, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the west, but that's an anomaly (which we need to continue and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spread).
</em><br>
<p>Technology is adopted for a lot of reasons, but as a rule I think it
<br>
is adopted because it gives some benefit. Not necessarily to the
<br>
people as a whole, and sometimes at the expense of one factor (such as
<br>
farming providing more and more reliable food than hunting, but at the
<br>
expense of a lot of labor). That is why much of our current
<br>
technological development is so amazing: it is distributed, and
<br>
inventions have to show themselves useful to enough customers to
<br>
spread. This is a huge democratization compared to how much has been
<br>
done in the past.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe the ancient romans had a similar situation? I have no idea.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the romans didn't really do much technological adoption once
<br>
they got their civilisation up and running. I guess there was quite a
<br>
bit of future shock as the latinians encountered Greek
<br>
ultratechnology, but they got over it. Unfortunately for them they had
<br>
a sociotechnological infrastructure that was a bit of a dead end - it
<br>
took a lot of slaves to run, and with many slaves there was little
<br>
incentive to make it more automated. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I like to think that this is quite in keeping with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism. Humans have been in a race for survival and expansion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over past millenia, and our conditions seem generally to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deteriorated with growing numbers. The hope is that we may finally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be (or soon be) on top of our technology to a point where it can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than keep ever more of us alive in worse overall circumstances;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe it can start to raise absolute standards, in aggregate.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is a far too pessimistic view. Look at life expectancy -
<br>
it has been rising since the stone age, with some plateaus and dips of
<br>
course, but in general it has been increasing. Why? Hardly because
<br>
conditions have become worse.
