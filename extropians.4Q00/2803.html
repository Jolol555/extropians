<br>
<p>I want to clear the air about Ken Wilber.  Originally, yes, he was a
<br>
transpersonal philosopher/psychologist.  His first book, &quot;Spectrums of
<br>
Consciousness&quot; was a corner stone of the movement.  However, that was almost
<br>
thirty years and he has revised his thinking.  He no longer considers
<br>
himself a transpersonal philosopher because it puts too much emphasis on the
<br>
transpersonal modalities of understanding.
<br>
<p>Integral Psychology (which is the name of his latest book) is how there are
<br>
multiple developmental lines (cognitive, emotional, biological, etc.) within
<br>
the individual and society.  Each person's development is the process of
<br>
integrating all lines of development into a unified whole.  It does not
<br>
emphasize spiritual ascendance or material descendance.  It's about
<br>
navigating all relaties as you work towards continual self-improvement.
<br>
<p>Yes, there are gaps in his theories.  He is not trying to flesh out all
<br>
points.  He is trying to integrate the teaching of philosophy, psychology
<br>
and spiritual traditions into a unified model of consciousness.  He's
<br>
creating a framework for others to flesh out.
<br>
<p>One of the most interesting points he has to make is that during
<br>
development, different neurosis can develop at each stage.  In order to
<br>
heal, you need to apply the right type of therapy for that stage of
<br>
development.  Another recommended book is his &quot;A Brief History of
<br>
Everything&quot;.
<br>
<p>For those of you who want an introduction to his ideas, I suggest visiting
