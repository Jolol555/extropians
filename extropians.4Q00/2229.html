<br>
<p>Seriously.  Many people who are, legally, perfectly innocent believe
<br>
they have something to fear from police and other government enforcers.
<br>
Granted, what they fear is abuse of the sort that would most likely be
<br>
illegal for the cops to pull.  However, just because something is
<br>
illegal does not mean it does not hapen, nor does it prevent people from
<br>
taking action to prevent it from happening (even, in this case, at the
<br>
cost of their vote by avoiding the polling place).
<br>
<p>Which brings up something that's been knocking around my mind for a
<br>
while.  In system designs, when you wish to prevent an action, you can
<br>
put in physical (or, for non-physical systems like programs, logical)
<br>
blocks that prevent the proscribed action.  For example, if you're
<br>
building a car and don't want it going over 90, you can put in a speed
<br>
governor to stop acceleration when it hits 89.  Sure, one could get to
<br>
89 and then go downhill to accelerate; if the desire for never-over-90
<br>
was strong enough, maybe the governor could kick in at 79 (assuming the
<br>
car will usually never be used on a hill long and flat enough to
<br>
accelerate from 79 to 91).
<br>
<p>I wonder if it would be possible to come up with inexpensive, similar
<br>
guards for illegal actions, where the problem is big enough that the
<br>
methods currently used to prevent these actions (for instance, avoiding
<br>
uniformed police at all costs in order to avoid police abuse) is far
<br>
from inexpensive (many societal costs of people not trusting the police
<br>
- whether the police earn that mistrust or not - are rather obvious,
<br>
when looked at as such).  If it becomes literally impossible to violate
<br>
the law, then &quot;enforcing&quot; the law becomes moot.  (Which would make the
<br>
issue of making sure the law is just and fair even more important, but
<br>
that's another topic...)
