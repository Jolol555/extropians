<p><em>&gt;Where are the threads on nutrition, etc.?  I don't see them much,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but I would imagine this is one of the core things we can do, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuals today, to assure we live to see more of the future,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instead of waiting for some technological savior to come and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;uplift us from our unhealthy lives.  
</em><br>
<p>Threads on these subjects come up all the time, most of the time
<br>
you don't see them because they've been discussed already. Just
<br>
recently I posted about a book by CBS medical man Dr Bob Arnot for
<br>
example. In fact I've dropped 10 hard-to-lose pounds so far
<br>
following this strategy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ironically, some of the best advice I've gotten on health,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nutrition, exercise, etc. comes from one of those mystic, green
</em><br>
<em>&gt;types that seem to be generally denigrated around here.  Maybe if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we listened with open minds instead of closed ears to some of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they had to say, we could learn something.
</em><br>
<p>If you have something usefull to contribute, go ahead and do so.
<br>
But remember you've a list of intelligent people here, many of them
<br>
scientists, and we've all seen every diet fad/nutritional quackery
<br>
to come along.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It would be a simple matter from an inexpensive launch mechanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to full-scale private habitation in space, to manufacturing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;community formation.
</em><br>
<p>Space is difficult, and expensive: prove me wrong, show us YOUR
<br>
business plan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(c) People who are not economic libertarians have significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;greivances; why aren't we addressing these?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The purpose of this list is not to address the grievences of those
<br>
who follow archaic ideas about economics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Things such as overseas labor conditions, personal sovereignty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;artificial scarcity in key needs (such as housing), environmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;degredation, and the oft-proven link between agrochemicals and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cancer are concerns raised again and again by those across the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political spectrum.  These are not political concerns, but social
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ones.
</em><br>
<p>Your welcome to go out and battle these windmills Don Quixote, but
<br>
your unlikely to find a Sancho here....  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Are these things dismissed because they're the hard questions, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we want to only answer the easy ones?  Or are they simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inconvenient for the political and personal philosophies of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the speakers here?  We are intelligent; we should all be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capable of rising above cheap rhetorical devices and knee-jerk
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dismissals to consider issues at the fundamental level.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;So what about these social issues, the ones that transcend simple 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political pigeonholing, despite our attempts to do so.  Let's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consider  how to take some of these issues from the statists, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;turn this to our advantage.  No one wants to see people starving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the street - how do you manage to feed people or enable them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feed themselves without turning to handouts and massive government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subsidies?  How do  you assure a stable food supply with fewer and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fewer externally added chemicals, while addressing the fears of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;outbreaks&quot; and possible negative reactions in those whom eat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these new foods?  It's all about tradeoffs in the real world - if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you fear the Greens so much, find what their issues are and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;present solutions to the issues that fit with your mode of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking, instead of simply dismissing them as non-issues.
</em><br>
<p>Go back and re-read the Extropians principals and see if this time
<br>
you can figure out what this list is for.
<br>
<p>I'm not being harsh or sarcastic, I'm trying to point out that what
<br>
you want to do is outside the purpose of this list.
<br>
<p>As an example, the comment about the greens, with the exception of
<br>
yet another redistribute-somebody-elses-wealth scheme, everything
<br>
they're advocating can be accomplished under the present system if
<br>
people are willing to do it. The fact is most people don't want to,
<br>
they want someone to force everyone do it.
<br>
<p>Not interested.
<br>
<p>If you are willing then go out, do it, and report back on your
<br>
success.
