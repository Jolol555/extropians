<p><em>&gt; The problem isn't that we require people to demonstrate that their

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  timespan.&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>I love it when bright &quot;amateurs&quot; figure things out from first principles and 
<br>
come to the same conclusion that &quot;experts&quot; do.  In this case, Anders, you'd 
<br>
done something I've seen happen a number of times since becoming involved in 
<br>
the transhumanist community: You've invented the Anglo-American common law of 
<br>
&quot;products liability&quot; and identified one of its key challenges.  Here, in two 
<br>
paragraphs, you've recapitulated 200 years of the development of this 
<br>
jurisprudence and arrived at the frontier of a field that absorbs a legion of 
<br>
good minds in economics and law.
<br>
<p>The challenge is indeed how best to use the clear benefits of the fine-tuned 
<br>
feedback of the case-by-case common law liability mechanism.  The superiority 
<br>
of this system to the Continental system of a-priori precise legislation and 
<br>
administrative regulation is clear, since it uses an on-going process of 
<br>
clarification and adjustment of standards to evolving circumstances in a way 
<br>
that's more insulated from temporary political pressures than the civil law 
<br>
system is.  However, the one fundamental problem is that presented by the 
<br>
need to tailor sanctions to harms in a way that properly compensates victims 
<br>
and disciplines actors, without creating the need for such great capital 
<br>
requirements that innovation is stifled.  In theory, the risk-spreading 
<br>
mechanism of liability insurance serves this purpose and in practice, in most 
<br>
circumstances, that mechanism works.  However, we see this system break down 
<br>
in the face of truly catastrophic damage and insidious, long-term 
<br>
environmental degradation.  
<br>
<p>The insurance industry tends to develop exclusions for perceived 
<br>
&quot;super-catastrophic&quot; and so-called &quot;long-tail&quot; claims. Examples of these 
<br>
phenomena in current practice is the near-universal &quot;nuclear exclusion&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;pollution exclusion&quot; in standard Commercial General Liability policies 
<br>
(commonly known as &quot;CGL&quot; insurance).  
<br>
<p>Specialty markets develop to insure such &quot;mega-risks&quot;, covering claims in 
<br>
these areas at a higher premium only for those companies that feel the need 
<br>
for or are legally compelled to carry it.  However, it takes time for this 
<br>
over-all mechanism of general exclusion and specialty coverage to develop and 
<br>
become properly applied to industries to which they are suited.  Typically, 
<br>
the process doesn't even start until claims for the special risk begin to 
<br>
accrue and specific underwriting markets develop around them.  In a world 
<br>
marked by increasingly rapid development of technologies that hold the threat 
<br>
of &quot;super-hyper-mega-risk&quot;, this process of organic development may well be 
<br>
too slow to accommodate the over-all level of threat to society.
<br>
<p>The case of claims arising from nuclear accidents is an exception that may 
<br>
well point the way to how the over-all process needs to evolve.  The 
<br>
widespread inclusion of a &quot;nuclear exclusion&quot; in CGL policies happened before 
<br>
there were any real claims in this industrial arena.  The exclusion developed 
<br>
as a response to general awareness in the early 1950s to the new and uniquely 
<br>
potent risk presented by nuclear technology.  The same may well need to 
<br>
happen in a prospective way to the generic threat posed by &quot;replicator 
<br>
technologies&quot;, i.e. nanotechnology, molecular biology and artificial 
<br>
intelligence and robotics. Bill Joy may well serve the same function to the 
<br>
legal and commercial system of common law liability that the vocal physicists 
<br>
of the 1940s and 1950s did.  Ironically, by sounding an alarm before the 
<br>
threat arrives, Joy may begin the process of commercial and legal 
<br>
accommodation that will make the development of the technologies he fears 
<br>
commercially and legally safe and possible.
