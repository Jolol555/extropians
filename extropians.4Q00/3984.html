Mike Lorrey writes, regarding <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9804020">http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9804020</a>,
<br>
which describes ancient Indian knowledge of the speed of light:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; this is one more april fools joke. the speed of light was not first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculated by measuring the time differences that light took to travel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Io to Earth in the 1600's depending on whether it was moving toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or going away from earth (how would they measure these times? The could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only have done so by redshift of spectral lines, which would have given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us relativity long before Einstein).
</em><br>
<p>First, it's clearly not an April Fool's joke.  The abstract reads,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We survey early Indian ideas on the speed of light and the size
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the universe. A context is provided for Sayana's statement
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(14th century)that the speed is 2,202 yojanas per half nimesha
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(186,000 miles per second!). It is shown how this statement may
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have emerged from early Puranic notions regarding the size of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the universe. Although this value can only be considered to be an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amazing coincidence, the Puranic cosmology at the basis of this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assertion illuminates many ancient ideas of space and time.
<br>
<p>So the author himself is claiming only that this value is a coincidence.
<br>
<p>Second, the story about measuring the speed of light in the 1600's is
<br>
real.  You don't measure redshift due to Io's motion; you measure the
<br>
difference in travel times due to the Earth's motion around the sun.
<br>
Earth is 16 light-minutes closer to Jupiter at one point in its
<br>
orbit than six months later, and so the measured interval between
<br>
Io's orbits would slow for 6 months and then speed up for another 6.
<br>
An astronomer correctly deduced that this was because of light taking
<br>
more time to get to the Earth at some points in its orbit than at others.
<br>

for discussion on early measurements of the speed of light.
