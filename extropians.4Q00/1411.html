<p><em>&gt;      I believe that I may no longer be a member of the ExI.  The reason I 
</em><br>
am 
<br>
<em>&gt;  not sure is that there is no difference between being a member and not 
</em><br>
being 
<br>
<em>&gt;  a member -- except that it costs more to be a member, of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       There are probably those on this list who consider joining the ExI.  
</em><br>
I 
<br>
<em>&gt;  would therefore like to warn them: since you get nothing for your money if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you send it to the ExI, you might as well flush it down the toilet.  I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  certain that you can use that money better.
</em><br>
<p>Why don't you tell us how you really feel, Ian - don't hold back!  
<br>
<p>In recent years, the primary value you get for your membership dues is a 
<br>
discount on the fee for participation in the EXTRO conferences.  We haven't 
<br>
had one since August of 1999 so, unless you attended that conference, you 
<br>
missed the most significant economic value you could have gotten from your 
<br>
membership.  Organizing a conference with worthwhile speakers in a good 
<br>
location is extremely expensive, even when you use a lot of volunteer (and 
<br>
vastly underappreciated) labor (thanks, Natasha and everyone else who made 
<br>
EXTRO4 happen).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        The first thing that &quot;happened&quot; was nothing -- that is, I couldn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  even get any confirmation that my membership fee had actually reached the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ExI.  Eventually I started sending emails to people whose address was on 
</em><br>
the 
<br>
<em>&gt;  Extropy site, asking if they had received the money.  Still nothing.  No 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  reply.  After half a year of sending emails to people who according to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Extropy site were representatives of the ExI, I finally received 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  confirmation that my money had indeed arrived, and that I was registered 
</em><br>
as 
<br>
<em>&gt;  a member.  That was all.  Then nothing again.
</em><br>
<p>I never heard from you, Ian.  We've just arranged for Shaun Russell to be ExI 
<br>
membership director.  I'm sorry you didn't get better communication from ExI. 
<br>
&nbsp;Improving that function is certainly one of our primary goals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;       That's it.  That is all you get as a member of the ExI: if you pester 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  them enough you may eventually receive confirmation that you are a member, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and that is all you will receive.  I don't know if the money you send in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  goes straight to Max More's own pocket.  He seems like a nice enough 
</em><br>
fellow, 
<br>
<em>&gt;  and I find it hard to believe that he is running this thing just as a way 
</em><br>
to 
<br>
<em>&gt;  make money on the poor suckers who send in money to the ExI.  
</em><br>
<p>Max hasn't received any salary from ExI in a LONG time - certainly since well 
<br>
before you sent in a membership fee.  I assure you that Max hasn't made ANY 
<br>
money from Extropy Institute that's worth considering at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do know what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that money is NOT used for, however.  It is not used to pay for printing 
</em><br>
and 
<br>
<em>&gt;  distributing the Extropy magazine to ExI members.  In fact, I seriously 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  doubt that that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  money goes to anything that benefits ExI members.
</em><br>
<p>You're right.  Printing the paper magazine has been a thing of the past for 
<br>
some time, as it was an ironic anachronism for a group that promotes advanced 
<br>
technology.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;        Hence, if you are thinking of applying for membership and sending 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  money to ExI, DON'T DO IT!.  Treat yourself to something nice for that 
</em><br>
money 
<br>
<em>&gt;  instead.  You won't receive anything at all for your money if you send it 
</em><br>
to 
<br>
<em>&gt;  the ExI.
</em><br>
<p>ExI has evolved over the years as the people involved have dealt with the 
<br>
progress of their own lives.  A few years ago, Max was in graduate school 
<br>
working on his PhD.  He had more time to devote to the organizational 
<br>
details.  I've never received a dime from ExI, and I have a very busy 
<br>
practice that makes it difficult for me to help with administrative details.  
<br>
We could use more constructive help from people who are enthusiastic and 
<br>
optimistic about the future (although we've certainly had some loyal and 
<br>
long-standing support with donations in kind from the folks at Javien in 
<br>
Canada - thanks!).
<br>
<p>To the extent that your criticisms have merit, I'll address them, although 
<br>
your tone certainly doesn't encourage constructive feedback.  Max has been 
<br>
very busy recently working on improving value to members.  There are projects 
<br>
in the works that will greatly improve the networking value that ExI members 
<br>
get from their dues.  We have plans for a strategic retreat for ExI 
<br>
benefactors, its prestigious advisory board and the many organizations that 
<br>
make up the network of future-oriented groups of which ExI has been a leading 
<br>
member.  EXTRO5 is taking shape and the EXTRO conferences will continue to be 
<br>
one of the greatest values members get from their dues.
<br>
<p>Finally, let me ask whether you ever asked what you could do to improve the 
<br>
value of our community?  Do you have skills that could add value?  Did you 
<br>
propose a project that would improve the future?  Many of our members have.  
<br>
Folks like Shaun and Brent Allsop and Alex Bokov have worked hard to 
<br>
experiment with ways to use the Web to make our community more valuable to 
<br>
its members.  People like Brian Atkins have been ready to put their money 
<br>
where their mouth is in speeding the arrival of a positive future.  (I know I 
<br>
haven't given credit in this post to everyone who deserves it - to all the 
<br>
volunteers - thanks!)  Perhaps you'd like to help.
