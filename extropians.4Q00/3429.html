No, it's not a straw man argument, I'm not asserting something which isn't
<br>
already in existence. What I'm talking about
<br>
(government programs which do things groups of people want done) exists. What
<br>
I'm talking about is that libertarians want
<br>
to take that away from people, and tell them 1) You're better off without it,
<br>
and 2) It wasn't yours anyway.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may (and largely do) agree with that, but that isn't the point. You WILL
<br>
BE taking away things people want when
<br>
you get the government to stop doing the things you don't want it to do. I never
<br>
&nbsp;said it was wrong to stop it, I think (mostly)
<br>
it IS stealing. What I am saying is that we're a minority in this opinion, no
<br>
matter how well we can back this up (facts, logic,
<br>
reasons), but it's not something anyone wants to admit. We pretend that by
<br>
shouting louder we're getting through, but what
<br>
we're doing is making sure we never get listened to. Ever. I know this for a
<br>
fact, from talking to people who make valid points
<br>
about welfare, from their own set of values, there's a point where your facts,
<br>
reasons, arguments, etc. mean nothing, and
<br>
you are just causing them to shut you out.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as that is true, you have to deal with it as it is, not as you wish
<br>
&nbsp;it to be. We're not going to change people's minds
<br>
by telling them they're wrong, that it's ok for some people to starve while
<br>
others are billionaires, that the money they get from the
<br>
government (and have gotten all their lives) isn't theirs.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point, here, is that it doesn't matter how much we 'know' we're right,
<br>
there are far too few of us to win this fight, this way.
<br>
So, now what? How do we make things better? Things are already as they are,
<br>
given how marginalized libertarians (and/or
<br>
extropians) are, what good does it do to pretend it's otherwise, or act as if
<br>
plains facts (about reality) don't exist?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, here is my semantic alteration point - you say is it wrong to use
<br>
force to stop force. What does force mean? Does
<br>
what you mean by it match what most people mean by it? If not, do they know what
<br>
&nbsp;you mean when you say it? I've seen an
<br>
argument to counter the no-force initiation argument about taxes, and it's
<br>
rather simple - taxes are the price you pay for living
<br>
in a modern, industrial country. Do I agree with that? No, but again, I'm in the
<br>
&nbsp;minority on this. So, you say, it's force to make me
<br>
pay taxes, it's countered with 'not by any accepted definition of force'. Try
<br>
using the argument about police coming to jail you
<br>
when you don't pay taxes, and they might shoot you. I guarantee you're going to
<br>
find people who will blame you for not paying
<br>
your taxes. And, again, there are more of them than us, and probably always will
<br>
&nbsp;be.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 'seems' to be an anti-government theme in our culture, but I don't
<br>
know how valid it is. I know people get angry
<br>
about specific governmental actions, but  I really don't think there's a general
<br>
&nbsp;'Government = bad' sentiment. I have friends,
<br>
acquaintances, co-workers, etc. from a large portion of the (American) political
<br>
&nbsp;spectrum, and almost none of them are
<br>
against the simple existence of government. Given that, arguing that government
<br>
shouldn't be allowed to do anything will fall
<br>
on deaf ears.

<p><em>&gt;That's a straw man, the old hostage taker guilt trip. Is using force to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stop people from using force wrong or hypocritical? That is the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principle of self defense. Eliminating programs that depend upon the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;involuntary confiscation of private property to exist is not wrong.
