</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think your roof size may be too low (depends a lot on how many stories
<br>
the home is) and your energy peak may be too high (Robert Freitas keeps
<br>
beating me up anytime I use a number over 400 W/m^2).  But I don't see
<br>
why you say 10% since my electric bill says I'm averaging 40 kWh/day
<br>
(and thats with a lot of computers on all the time).
<br>
<p>Your point is taken though.  The efficiency needs to go up.  You can
<br>
always double the roof area by doing a little reconstruction.  And
<br>
if the material is really cheap (like tar paper), you would put
<br>
it on the exterior wall surfaces as well.  You probably couldn't
<br>
disconnect yourself from the grid, but you could make a good dent
<br>
in your electric bill.  The real trick will be lowering the electrical
<br>
requirements of the refridgerator, since that is generally the biggest
<br>
draw in the house.  We need some more progress with magnetic cooling
<br>
using gandolinium or acoustic cooling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have to HAVE self replicating systems BEFORE they can beat overcoming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravity. How much R&amp;D do you think it will take?
</em><br>
Maybe 50 man-years worth.  I think I can do it within the next 2 years.
<br>
I don't know if I can build solar cells with them yet but H2 or CH3
<br>
production will definately be doable.  I'll send you a copy of the
<br>
patents once they get filed.
