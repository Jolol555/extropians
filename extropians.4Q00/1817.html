<em>&gt; &gt; Now, corn, up until 500 years ago was completely unknown to anyone but Native

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans or their domesticated animals to be adapted to digesting efficiently or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; healthfully.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only sweet corn, which is grown for human consumption, has enough sugar to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be sweet to the taste. Field corn, from which animal feeds, corn syrup, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost all other corn products are derived, is very starchy and not very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sweet. Rice, wheat, and barley are also &quot;atom bombs&quot; of starches. What makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them so great and corn so evil?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you say that? As far as I can tell, corn, barley, and rice are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; strikingly similar, nutrionally. For example, see:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;   <a href="http://waltonfeed.com/self/ntr3.html">http://waltonfeed.com/self/ntr3.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Where then is the wheat, rice, and barley syrup?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All of those exist, they're just much more expensive to produce than corn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; syrup.
</em><br>
<p>Why is that, if they are so similar?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Corn is higher in sugar (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; notice the page you referenced does not break down the carbohydrates at all),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, it's not. Corn syrup isn't produced by tapping cornstalks and ears and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boiling the sap. It's produced by chemically converting the starches to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sugars, a process known as refining. For more information, see:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.corn.org">http://www.corn.org</a>
</em><br>
<p>This page does nothing to detail the carbohydrate content versus other grains. I
<br>
suspect there are significant differences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and is also very low in thiamin, niacin, and calcium compared to the others,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; though it is well endowed with Vitamin A. The sugar is the big thing, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cornfed cows are sugar junkies, this I know from experience, since if given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opportunity they will prefer cereal surplus even over well fermented silage (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; apple jacks and other cinnamon cereals do tend to pass the cinnamon through to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the milk, though).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cereal is sweetened. You can't blame that on the corn.
</em><br>
<p>Sweetened with corn syrup, right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not for me. I want my meat from lean athletic animals that work for a living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (and work out all day). Fish swim all day, grouse, woodcock, duck, geese, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wild turkey all scratch out their living in the wild, deer get chased around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pretty thoroughly by dogs, coyotes, cars, and any odd sound that sets them into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hysterics, while moose are constantly working the swamp wading treadmill, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; caribou are the long distance kings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's fine. You're welcome to eat whatever kind of meat you like. Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people would probably find it tough and oddly flavored. It's probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthier than grain-finished beef. It seems to me, though, that the health
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits are due primarily to the lower fat content.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, caribou is far more tender than most beef I have had, while at the
<br>
same time lower in fat, by far. I don't know why it is so tender, perhaps
<br>
because the muscle fibers are finer, but it is. Venison and moose are not tough,
<br>
and the flavoring is fine if you treat the animal right after shooting it.
<br>
Venison burgers are better than just about anything, and garlic and cheese bear
<br>
sausage is quite tasty. Proper field dressing, and transporting it cold (i.e.
<br>
not over the hood of your engine or flat on the bed of your pickup over the
<br>
muffler, use a pallet or two to support the animal, or better yet, use a
<br>
trailer) minimize the 'gaminess', which is actually caused by this preheating
<br>
which sours the meat (shooting the animal while in rut also contributes to this,
<br>
and I'll bet cows don't get butchered in estrus, do they?). Meat ought to have
<br>
tastes that are different for each animal. Duck, pheasant, and woodcock are some
<br>
of my favorite tasting meats. The bland 'tastes like chicken' attitude is for
<br>
people that might as well be living on oatmeal, and the taste of beef is just
<br>
the taste of fatty meat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You may have hormone and chemical free cattle, but unless they walk at least a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; few miles a day and live off the land, I'm not interested.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You misunderstand. My beef is not for sale. I understand and agree with your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire for hormone and chemical free meat, but I'm not as convinced of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need for them to live off the land and walk N miles per/day. (My cattle walk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite a bit, but I've never attached bovine pedometers to them to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly how far they go.) I like my beef fairly lean, too, but I like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tender steak now and then, and I like the way grain-finished beef tastes. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was willing to give all that up for the health benefits, I'd give up beef
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altogether.
</em><br>
<p>Frankly I would not mind if they took hormones, so long as they were fit.
