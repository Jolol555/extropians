Hi Jason (have changed thread, since this seems more to do with
<br>
psychology &amp; identity than it does to &quot;greens&quot;).
<br>
<p>I don't want to waste time on semantical arguments here ... but we have
<br>
may differing concepts of &quot;belief&quot; ... which I think of as being
<br>
emotional/subconscious to a greater degree than they are explitic
<br>
and articulated. The notion of stripping away belief structures is
<br>
less valid than notions of excorcising psychological imbalance
<br>
(through hypnosis and psychotherapy).
<br>
<p>For example, I happen to think all the main world religions are
<br>
intellectually &quot;wrong&quot; in making their various supernatural claims. But
<br>
those who follow these religions do so for social and emotional reasons, and
<br>
are
<br>
not open to persuasion out of their faiths by intellectual argument alone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In any case, observationally your belief is clearly wrong-- or do you not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see millions of ongoing examples of individual humans falling prey to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;limiting belief structures?
</em><br>
<p>You are inserting a value judgement &quot;falling prey&quot; to &quot;limiting&quot; beliefs.
<br>
But
<br>
fairy stories &amp;c. can be very comforting for individuals, and the
<br>
psychological
<br>
benefits may outweigh the intellectual doubts.
<br>
<p>There are valid differences in beliefs also ... I only agree in part with
<br>
the Extropian principles ... since Extropianism is just one brand of
<br>
after-humanity, and I represent a different brand (direct posthuman). It
<br>
isn't fair to say one or the other is &quot;limiting&quot; or &quot;clearly wrong.&quot;
<br>
There is a tendency to generalise and over-simplifying ... especially
<br>
amongst
<br>
those steeped in the failed human-era Philosophical quagmire.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Huh?  I -do- have an ego (it's true) but in what fashion have you seen it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reflected unflatteringly in my previous post?
</em><br>
<p>Simply the over-concern with and drive for personal power .... I suffer from
<br>
this trait also on occasions. As a therapist, sometimes I find it good to
<br>
boost the self-esteem and sense of worth of a client (ego-strengthening, the
<br>
Western way) and sometimes it might be useful to deflate the ego and stand
<br>
back (ego-dissolution, the Eastern way).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; All environments are mental constructs .. sense data isn't direct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The world is located in consciousness&quot; (Kuhlenbeck).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our (E-1) brain generates a phantom median eye out of the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action potential/ neural information that carries generic sense-data ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is the ONLY explanation of consciousness that squares Leibnitz' Law.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I agree.
</em><br>
<p>With MVT, or with the Idealist proposition? MVT is the key to all of this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You're going to make me do this again, ain'tcha?  Okay...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Environments have decreased relevancy to our existence is we don't actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get to &quot;mentally interface&quot; with them.
</em><br>
<p>No, aeons ago our ancestors' behaviour was governed by sunlight
<br>
&amp; the primal eye, whereas nowadays our E-1 brains have infinite-state
<br>
capability (self-organising) since they are no longer governed by the
<br>
organic
<br>
(primal eye) external clock.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I'm not directly referencing some core truth of reality, but rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remarking on an empowering means by which we might consider interfacing
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt;it.  I'm not talking Rocket Science (tm) here either-- simply: a) be aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of how we are capable of interacting with reality, and be) take advantage
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt;it to optimise our existence.
</em><br>
<p>We can't &quot;interface&quot; with reality directly .. merely model it and make
<br>
abstract mental
<br>
representations ... as well as painting it/ writing music/ explore it thru
<br>
science &amp;c.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; By rehearsal and constant practice, we become more like the think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we pretend to be, but they are all &quot;thought-constructs&quot; still.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is just a case of finding our most accurate/ comfortable option.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All these roles are subject to change ... the point is we should aim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to become &quot;more than human.&quot; Immortality is earnt, not given.
</em><br>
<p>If &quot;pretending&quot; to be those things adds observable value to your existence,
<br>
and aids in achieving certain goals, then I say go for it.  (Premises which
<br>
are, perhaps, debatable.)
<br>
<p>It seems to me that most roles &amp; beviour are &quot;learnt&quot; at some stage on some
<br>
level, and thus all our behaviour is &quot;pretence&quot; or acting&quot; even if we often
<br>
successfully disguise this pretence from ourselves! The best liars are those
<br>
who
<br>
can convince themselves of their lies.
<br>
<p>All I am saying is (1) understand this, and (2) use it to your advantage by
<br>
writing and editing your own script, don't pretend to be a character that
<br>
others have scripted for you. There are better things to be than &quot;human&quot; ..
<br>
this is just a tired old legacy label ... but then presumably we are all
<br>
after/trans-human
<br>
and agree with this statement?
<br>
