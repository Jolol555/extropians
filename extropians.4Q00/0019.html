<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Brawling was something I became
<br>
<em>&gt; proficient at, whether I wanted to or not ... I learned to fight dirty,
</em><br>
strangling, poking eyes, kneeing
<br>
<em>&gt; groins, and how to use a club and quarterstaff and broken bottle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (thankfully I only had to bluff with the bottle).
</em><br>
<p>It was similar (though not as bad--maybe only a fight or two a day) for
<br>
my brother in Houston.  There were some guys in metal shop who regularly
<br>
threatened him with sharp pieces of metal.  Even as a girl, I got into my
<br>
share of fights in the early years, had my glasses broken, got my clothes
<br>
dirty and torn.  My cousin once used a broken bottle--luckily she too
<br>
only had to bluff with it.  
<br>
<p>On several occasions male friends of mine got into knife fights in
<br>
highschool, and a couple of times I had friends who were wounded, but
<br>
none of my friends was ever killed (not in a knife fight anyhow).  Some
<br>
of these fights took place in the school building.
<br>
<p>OTOH, things seem to be pretty tame these days at my daughter's school in
<br>
a small town.  There's been a suicide, but I don't think there have been
<br>
any murders the whole time she's been in highschool.
