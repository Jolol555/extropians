<p><em>    &gt; Your duplicate earth doesn't explain anything.  It merely restates
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; your position.  You claim that the duplicates are somehow connected
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; or mystically &quot;one&quot;.  But you don't explain why you claim this.
</em><br>
<p>If you're on the Extropian list I assume you believe that mind is what the brain
<br>
does, if the brains are identical then what they're doing is identical and so  the mind
<br>
is identical and the feeling of self is identical. That doesn't seem very mystical to me.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; According to this line of reasoning, I don't ever need to watch a
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; movie.  It doesn't matter whether my particular hardware experiences
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the movie.  Someone somewhere probably saw the same movie and reacted
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the way I would.
</em><br>
<p>What on Earth are you talking about? If I have not seen the movie but my
<br>
(semi) copy has then we are no longer identical and I am not him anymore.
<br>
Nothing vary mystical in that either.
<br>
<p><em>        &gt;&gt;Me:
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;&gt;Try the experiment. Switch the position of the two hydrogen atoms and you
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;&gt;find that the state of the system remains identical,  the two could be
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;&gt; instantaneously changing position and there would be no way two tell and
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;&gt; no reason to care.
</em><br>
<p><em>    &gt; Why do you assume this?  One may be sharing a bond with an oxygen
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; molecule, while one is not.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, before the switch one hydrogen atom is bound to oxygen and one is not,
<br>
after the switch one hydrogen atom is bound to oxygen and one is not.
<br>
No detectable change.
<br>
But wait, now a new hydrogen atom is bound to oxygen and a new one is not!
<br>
How can you tell?
<br>
You can't.
<br>
<p>By the way, this business about instantly changing identities isn't just some
<br>
silly game, it's behind the entire idea of exchange forces in physics, you can even
<br>
use it to derive the Pauli Exclusion Principle and that is the foundation of chemistry
<br>
and that is the foundation of biology and that is the foundation of us. I show just
<br>
how this can be done and some other stuff too in my dialog &quot;Waiting For Zed&quot; at
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/zed.htm">http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/zed.htm</a>

<p><em>    &gt;You still aren't explaining why you think that just putting
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; them in the same environment mystically links them so that they
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; become &quot;one&quot; with each other.
</em><br>
<p>I believe I have explained that, identical things do identical things.
<br>
Nothing very mystical about that either.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; What transfers the consciousness between one to the other?
</em><br>
<p>I've answered this several times also, Information. If you don't like my
<br>
answer then criticize it, but don't keep asking the same question.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;When I  send you these notes, and you read my exact sentences
</em><br>
<p>Maybe that's the problem, I haven't read your exact sentences I've only
<br>
read copies.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;I don't feel  that I am transferring bits of consciousness to you.
</em><br>
<p>But my consciousness at this instant would be different if you had not sent them.
<br>
Nothing very mystical about that either
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;If your  goal is to preserve information, all humans could die and floppy
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; disks could live on.  However, those floppies aren't alive,
</em><br>
<p>Straw man, we both know why.
