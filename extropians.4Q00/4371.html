<p><em>&gt; &gt;now, I've been thinking of leaving my studies of Philosophy and Psychology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(neither of which seem to be getting me anywhere), and going into the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Slightly off topic, but it's useless to major in something like philosophy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or psychology. I'm not talking about the tired (but true) argument that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are not profitable later in life. I just mean that these are things you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not really need formal instruction in to learn. Someone who devotes 4 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years to studying philosophy, or psychology (or art history, etc.) is going 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be better off then someone with a major in it. I learned more about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive science from my own studies then from majoring in it. The only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really interesting thing I learned in psychology was about cool experiments 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they did with monkeys.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes and no. I agree that it is quite possible to educate
<br>
yourself in an useful way into fields where you have no formal
<br>
training, I do it all the time myself. But at the same time I have
<br>
found that the formal training does contain stuff that you tend to
<br>
ignore when you look at the field &quot;from the outside&quot;. For example, in
<br>
psychology you learn a lot about statistics and test design, which are
<br>
IMHO dreadfully boring - but unless you become well acquainted with
<br>
them you will become uncritical towards the whole field. The same goes
<br>
for (say) linear algebra - not the most exciting part of math, but it
<br>
is taught early on for a reason. A skilled self-educator will of
<br>
course pick things like this up, but it is not always obvious.
<br>
<p>Another issue is whether you might have a use of a title. My views
<br>
became markedly more convincing to people when I got my M.Sc, and I
<br>
have little doubt that little Ph.D. will further my aims even
<br>
more. Not monetarily (I would be better off consulting or writing
<br>
database software or virtual machines like my brother), but by gaining
<br>
certain forms of credibility. Today I was interviewed on radio about
<br>
cloning, and one reason I was on the air was because I obviously was a
<br>
serious character - after all, I have an office at the Royal Institute
<br>
of Technology. Maybe that is a stupid game - I know plenty of people
<br>
with no formal background that know more than me - but it is part of
<br>
the primate structures and can be used as an exercise in applying
<br>
those skills you learn by playing roleplaying games.
<br>
<p>(Only 343 more experience points and I will go up a level to Ph.D.!
<br>
Then I will get access to spell-lists like Letter to the Editor,
<br>
Instant Expert and the dreaded Statistics Deluge. Now I better slay
<br>
that dragon... I mean finish my research paper. Where did I put my +5
<br>
Pen of Neuroscience?)
