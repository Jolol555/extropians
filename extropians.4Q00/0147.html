&quot;Spike Jones&quot;  contends,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ive met a number of you guys face to face and there isnt a one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you I would call even slightly evil, or even abnormally mean.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Get over it already!  {8^D  spike
</em><br>
<p>Gosh, where were you when my step-dad called me a &quot;murderer&quot; for killing a field
<br>
mouse (I was 12, the mouse died when I threw dirt on it while digging an
<br>
irrigation ditch).
<br>
Halloween's coming. Can't some of us be just a little abnormally mean?
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p><p><p>&quot;When Gore Vidal made media history by calling William Buckley a
<br>
&quot;crypto-Nazi&quot; in front of millions of television viewers during the 1968
<br>
Democratic convention, he presumably meant that beneath Buckley's
<br>
conservative facade lurked a fascist trying to keep the public -- or
<br>
himself -- from seeing his true colors. At least, that's the way Buckley
<br>
took it; Vidal later pointed out that what he'd actually called his
<br>
archenemy was a &quot;pro crypto-Nazi,&quot; in reference to Buckley's defense of the
<br>
Chicago police, who were at that moment battering demonstrators with gleeful
<br>
abandon in the streets outside. This version would make the cops the
<br>
Nazis-in-law-enforcement-officers'-clothing; Buckley merely a sympathizer
<br>
and, possibly, only a quasi-Nazi himself. (This
<br>
&quot;less-than-a-full-fledged-Nazi&quot; interpretation is bolstered by Vidal's
<br>
adding that, in fact, he hadn't meant to use the term Nazi at all; had he
<br>
not blown his cool, he said, he would have called his opponent merely
<br>
&quot;Fascist-minded.&quot;) Because a crypto-Nazi has something to gain by keeping
<br>
her real feelings hidden, and a quasi-Nazi probably isn't sure just what her
<br>
real feelings are, you don't have to get out of the way of either of them
<br>
quite as fast as you do some of those neo-Nazi organizations whose members
<br>
like to parade up and down Midwestern streets in modified Luftwaffe surplus,
<br>
paint swastikas on synagogues, and bash the heads of whichever minority
<br>
groups they feel are polluting the race these days. In other words, the
<br>
neo-Nazi is, or likes to think she is, the real thing, updated. Last and
<br>
certainly least, don't worry at all abut those fifteen-year-old pseudo-Nazi
<br>
rockers who like to affect combat boots and Iron Crosses and who go around
<br>
spouting a lot of racist rhetoric they picked up at the last heavy-metal
<br>
concert; they're just out to scare you in the hopes of being taken seriously
<br>
for a change.&quot;
<br>
--William Wilson
