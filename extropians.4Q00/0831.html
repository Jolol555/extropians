</em><br>
<p>But this problem you describe of the excessive context dependence of
<br>
things learned *is* exactly the inherent difficult of communication.
<br>
All learning is naturally context dependent, and it takes substantial
<br>
cognitive effort to strip out person-specific context in order to try
<br>
to communicate what you've learned to other people.  Your hypothesis is
<br>
that some other architecture will do better at abstracting from
<br>
person-specific context when learning, which would then directly make
<br>
communication easier.
