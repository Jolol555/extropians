<p><em>&gt; So I'm wondering, what work has been or is being done on the &quot;brain in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vat&quot; scenerio - by that I just mean keeping it alive and functional. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume there isn't much being done, so what is it that has to be done?
</em><br>
<p>To  my limited knowledge  there is  indeed very  little being  done on
<br>
this. But  work on artificial  blood, artificial livers,  dialysis and
<br>
heart-lung machines are clearly relevant. 
<br>
<p>But I don't think it is going to be a very elegant system or even
<br>
movable before we have nanotech, good biotech or at least good
<br>
microtechnology, there are a lot of nasty engineering details to solve
<br>
(such as preventing clotting, keeping chemical homeostasis and
<br>
especially, good brain-computer interfaces). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only other thing I can think of is the immune system, which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really know nothing about at all (are white blood cells self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproducing or do they come from the marrow like red cells?).
</em><br>
<p>They are mainly generated in the marrow, in a quite interesting
<br>
cascade. The problem is that if you want a working immune system for
<br>
your cyborg or brain in vat, you would need to deal with moving both
<br>
the marrow and the &quot;training&quot; structures of the thymus or lymph nodes
<br>
where the cells learn how to distinguish self from non-self (if you
<br>
avoid using an immune system, then you get less problems of rejection
<br>
of the &quot;implants&quot; (explants?) of the brain). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In some situations this may be preferable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to biological existence. By making some changes to account for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temperature variations (keeping the brain at a constant temperature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be required anyway), the robot could basically be a space suit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the brain, or a diving suit.  Nobody say anything about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading.. I'm thinking nearer term.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I think this is doable in the long run, but I think it will
<br>
never catch on because it is very cumbersome to achieve with low
<br>
technology, and as technology gets better alternatives to the brain in
<br>
vat approach will emerge. It might be useful in emergency medicine
<br>
(where some cases are good approximations to this problem), but as a
<br>
way of life?
<br>
<p>(I actually though this was a great idea myself some years back, but
<br>
that was before studying too much medicine. Things like that tend to
<br>
make you sceptic, you see all the devils in all the details. I could
<br>
be quite wrong, of course)
