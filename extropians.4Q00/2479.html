<p>
<em>&gt; Of course, extropy has been called a cult before, usually by trolls,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much like yourself.  As there is no particular OTHER reason to call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropianism a cult, (as I'll attempt to show), usually they fall back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on calling us dogmatists, which, I have to presume, is what you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driving at in your parody of an extropian calling deep-ecologists &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DEVIL.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't calling it a cult- I was just referring to the attitude many
<br>
extropians have regarding &quot;The Singularity&quot;.  We're running out of
<br>
resources, destroying our environment- yet you seem to think that we'll be
<br>
saved by this occurence.  I think otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I've said before, no extropian is my leader.  None of them tell me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what to do, or what to believe.  I've disagreed with Max More, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, time and again.  I'm sure I will in the future.
</em><br>
<p>I'll disagree too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think he and I agree that there is not only a non-trivial chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apocalyptic disaster in the next century, (a possibility which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone became aware of around the time of the cold war,) but also a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance of unprecedented wealth, longevity, and, dare I say it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness.  Neither of these possibilities is inevitable, though I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think they're quite likely outcomes of the next century or two.
</em><br>
<p>By apocalypse, I was not referring to disaster, but to rapture.  Where is
<br>
all this wealth going to come from, with our resources destroyed by the
<br>
wasteful behavior of the 20th century?  Where is this longevity going to
<br>
come from, with our veins filled with carcinogens and our bodies bombarded
<br>
by radiation?  Where is this happiness going to come from, with our
<br>
spirituality destroyed by &quot;flatlander&quot; philosophers, our arts smashed by a
<br>
media concerned only with profits, living in a world where we work from
<br>
sunup until sundown with no hope for another world hereafter?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But it is in holding these beliefs *tentatively*, and in not allowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our beliefs to be determined by a leader or any other person, that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrate our rationality (in particular, our rejection of dogma).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are not cultists or dogmatists of any other kind.
</em><br>
<p>Rationalism is a dogma in of itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't know much about Gnosticism.  I do know that typical Gnostics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have tended to prioritize the &quot;spiritual&quot; realm over the &quot;physical&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realm.  I rather doubt most extropians would agree with that.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but they were working from an ascending paradigm.  Extropianism is
<br>
Gnosticism reversed, the exact same stand within a descending paradigm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, most Gnostics also hold that gnosis, a special kind of arcane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge, is what you need to survive apocalypse.  While I think most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us agree that you can make yourself more powerful if you know more,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge by itself won't make you better off.  I rather doubt that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there will be a mystic quiz at the end of time; if anybody here DOES
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that, I rather doubt they believe that this is view is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly relevant to extropy.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, this is where you are incorrect.  Gnosticism isn't just about posessing
<br>
the knowledge- it's about using it.  Extropianism is about knowledge as
<br>
well, and the gaining of a form of arcane knowledge- Artificial
<br>
intelligence, nanotech, etc.
