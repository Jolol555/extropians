<em>&gt; Funny I had never thought of doing a search on myself, though.  Must be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blindspot.

<p>The majority of people on the net do not appreciate that keystrokes never
<br>
die. The more of your life that is spent on the net, then the more that is
<br>
available for public inspection. As has been pointed out, doing a few Web
<br>
searches can turn up an incredible amount of information on some netizens.
<br>
And remember the Web is not the whole Internet. Many databases can only be
<br>
searched outside the Web.
<br>
At present you still need a bit of training before you can do efficient
<br>
searches. You need to know what search engines to use, how to ask the right
<br>
questions of them and where to look. (100,000 links with Bill Clinton in
<br>
them is not much use to anybody!)  This is a chargeable service which some
<br>
investigators will provide - and it doesn't mean doing anything illegal,
<br>
like involving bribery and corruption. The Freedom of Information Act is a
<br>
goldmine for investigators. Your email addresses, postal address, phone
<br>
number, medical records, Social Security no, academic and job record can all
<br>
be obtained. Add on your Web site info, newsgroups, mail lists and chat
<br>
rooms and we're beginning to get the picture. Some parents have started
<br>
using services like this (or doing it themselves) to check out the latest
<br>
specimen that their teenage daughter has brought home as a boyfriend. (They
<br>
don't all have piercings, tattoos, earrings and leather jackets - some look
<br>
almost human).  Flat sharers do it to check up on prospective flatmates,
<br>
list members do it to find out about new list members, etc.
<br>
<p>And it is not only you. If you have children or partners on the Web, do you
<br>
know how much information they are giving away?
<br>
<p>Come the fully Open Society, of course, then everyone will know what you had
<br>
for breakfast (and who you had breakfast with!)  And, if you're interested,
<br>
you will be able to know the same about them.

<p>Solipsism Warning:
<br>
The consumer should be aware that he or she may be the only entity in
<br>
the universe, and therefore that any perceived defects in product
<br>
quality are the consumer's own fault.
