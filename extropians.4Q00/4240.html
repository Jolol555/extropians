<br>
<p>______________________________________________________________________
<br>
New York Times, John Markoff, December 29, 1988:
<br>
______________________________________________________________________
<br>
Computer scientists and Government officials are urging the creation 
<br>
of a nationwide &quot;data superhighway&quot; that they believe would have a 
<br>
dramatic economic impact, rivaling that of the nation's interstate 
<br>
highway system.
<br>
<p>This highway would consist of a high-speed fiber-optic data network 
<br>
joining dozens of supercomputers at national laboratories and making 
<br>
them available to thousands of academic and industry researchers 
<br>
around the country ...
<br>
<p>Legislation introduced in October by Senator Albert Gore, Democrat of 
<br>
Tennessee, included initial financing for development and 
<br>
construction of a National Research Network. Backers of the measure 
<br>
say that Federal financing for the project is necessary to develop 
<br>
the technology and convince industry that vastly speedier computer 
<br>
networks are commercially viable.
<br>
<p>______________________________________________________________________
<br>
The Houston Chronicle, &quot;Data superhighway' for nation's computers 
<br>
approved by Congress&quot;, November 30, 1991:
<br>
______________________________________________________________________
<br>
A plan to create a high-tech &quot;data superhighway&quot; likened in 
<br>
importance to the creation of the nation's highway system has been 
<br>
approved by Congress and sent to President Bush for his signature.
<br>
<p>The plan would create a high-speed national computer networking 
<br>
infrastructure that would link computers in the nation's research, 
<br>
education and military establishments.
<br>
<p>Proponents say that this network eventually will evolve into a 
<br>
universally available National Public Telecomputing Network that may 
<br>
be the successor to the telephone system, marrying the entertainment, 
<br>
communications and computer industries.
<br>
<p>The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991, which contains the plan, 
<br>
was approved by a House-Senate conference committee over the weekend 
<br>
after being stalled for several weeks because of disagreement over a 
<br>
&quot;buy American first&quot; provision.
<br>
<p>The bill, sponsored by Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., does not provide 
<br>
funding for the effort. Budget allocations and appropriations must be 
<br>
made individually during each year of the program.

Time Magazine interview with Vint Cerf, inventor of the Internet 
<br>
Protocol, June 14, 2000:
<br>
______________________________________________________________________
<br>
Timehost: Welcome to the TIME auditorium. We're thrilled to have as 
<br>
our guest Vinton Cerf, one of the inventors of the Internet. Mr. Cerf 
<br>
has just written an article for TIME magazine, in which he says that 
<br>
the Internet will be everywhere. Even, literally, in our bodies! So 
<br>
send in your questions about the past, present and future of the 
<br>
Internet. Who better to answer those questions than the man who 
<br>
invented the Internet? (Sorry, Al Gore)
<br>
<p>Timehost: Mr. Cerf is now with us. Welcome!
<br>
<p>Vinton Cerf: Good evening, or whatever time zone you are in, hi!! 
<br>
While we're waiting for questions, I'd like to clear up one little 
<br>
item - about the Vice President ... He really does deserve some 
<br>
credit for his early recognition of the importance of the Internet 
<br>
and the technology that makes it work. He was certainly among the 
<br>
first if not the first in Congress to realize how powerful the 
<br>
information revolution would be and both as Senator and Vice 
<br>
President he has been enormously helpful in supporting legislation 
<br>
and programs to help further develop the Internet - for example the 
<br>
Next Generation Internet program. I get to see a lot of this stuff 
<br>
because I am a member of the President's Information Technology 
<br>
Advisory Committee and we regularly review the R&amp;D programs of the US 
<br>
Government and many have relevance to the evolving Internet.
<br>
<p>______________________________________________________________________
<br>
National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1986
<br>
Computer Network Study Amendment
<br>
(Al Gore speaking)
<br>
______________________________________________________________________
<br>
MR. PRESIDENT, IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO SUPPORT THE PROPOSED 
<br>
NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AUTHORIZATION ACT.
<br>
<p>WITHIN THIS BILL I HAVE TWO AMENDMENTS, THE COMPUTER NETWORK STUDY 
<br>
AND THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT REPORT. THE FIRST AMENDMENT WAS ORIGINALLY 
<br>
INTRODUCED WITH SENATOR GORTON AS S. 2594. IT CALLS FOR A 2-YEAR 
<br>
STUDY OF THE CRITICAL PROBLEMS AND CURRENT AND FUTURE OPTIONS 
<br>
REGARDING COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS FOR RESEARCH COMPUTERS. THE SECOND 
<br>
AMENDMENT REQUIRES THE PRESIDENT TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO CONGRESS ON 
<br>
THE ACTIONS TAKEN TO ESTABLISH AN INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE 
<br>
GREENHOUSE EFFECT.
<br>
<p>BOTH OF THESE AMENDMENTS SEEK NEW INFORMATION ON CRITICAL PROBLEMS OF 
<br>
TODAY. THE COMPUTER NETWORK STUDY ACT IS DESIGNED TO ANSWER CRITICAL 
<br>
QUESTIONS ON THE NEEDS OF COMPUTER TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS OVER 
<br>
THE NEXT 15 YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT ARE THE FUTURE REQUIREMENTS FOR 
<br>
COMPUTERS IN TERMS OF QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF DATA TRANSMISSION, DATA 
<br>
SECURITY, AND SOFTWEAR [sic] COMPATIBILITY? WHAT EQUIPMENT MUST BE 
<br>
DEVELOPED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HIGH TRANSMISSION RATES OFFERED BY 
<br>
FIBER OPTIC SYSTEMS?
<br>
<p>BOTH SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO HANDLE THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF SUPERCOMPUTERS 
<br>
AND SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF SMALLER RESEARCH COMPUTERS 
<br>
WILL BE EVALUATED. THE EMPHASIS IS ON RESEARCH COMPUTERS, BUT THE 
<br>
USERS OF ALL COMPUTERS WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS STUDY. TODAY, WE CAN 
<br>
BANK BY COMPUTER, SHOP BY COMPUTER, AND SEND LETTERS BY COMPUTER. 
<br>
ONLY A FEW COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS USE THESE SERVICES, BUT THE 
<br>
NUMBER IS GROWING AND EXISTING CAPABILITIES ARE LIMITED.
<br>
<p>IN ORDER TO COPE WITH THE EXPLOSION OF COMPUTER USE IN THE COUNTRY, 
<br>
WE MUST LOOK TO NEW WAYS TO ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN 
<br>
TELECOMMUNICATIONS -- NEW WAYS TO INCREASE THE SPEED AND QUALITY OF 
<br>
THE DATA TRANSMISSION. WITHOUT THESE IMPROVEMENTS, THE 
<br>
TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS FACE DATA BOTTLENECKS LIKE THOSE WE FACE 
<br>
EVERY DAY ON OUR CROWDED HIGHWAYS.
<br>
<p>THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS ALREADY AWARE OF THE NEED TO EVALUATE AND ADOPT 
<br>
NEW TECHNOLOGIES. ONE PROMISING TECHNOLOGY IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
<br>
FIBER OPTIC SYSTEMS FOR VOICE AND DATA TRANSMISSION. EVENTUALLY WE 
<br>
WILL SEE A SYSTEM OF FIBER OPTIC SYSTEMS BEING INSTALLED NATIONWIDE.
<br>
<p>AMERICA'S HIGHWAYS TRANSPORT PEOPLE AND MATERIALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
<br>
FEDERAL FREEWAYS CONNECT WITH STATE HIGHWAYS WHICH CONNECT IN TURN 
<br>
WITH COUNTY ROADS AND CITY STREETS. TO TRANSPORT DATA AND IDEAS, WE 
<br>
WILL NEED A TELECOMMUNICATIONS HIGHWAY CONNECTING USERS COAST TO 
<br>
COAST, STATE TO STATE, CITY TO CITY. THE STUDY REQUIRED IN THIS 
<br>
AMENDMENT WILL IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES THE NATION 
<br>
WILL FACE IN ESTABLISHING THAT HIGHWAY.
<br>
[Upper case shown, indicating a contemporaneous insertion into the 
<br>
Congressional Record at the time of corresponding floor debate.]
<br>
<p>______________________________________________________________________
<br>
National High-Performance Computer Technology Act of 1988
<br>
(Al Gore speaking)
<br>
______________________________________________________________________
<br>
THIS LEGISLATION TAKES THE FIRST CRITICAL STEPS TO ADDRESS THOROUGHLY 
<br>
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN PROMOTING HIGH-PERFORMANCE 
<br>
COMPUTING. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS, WE CAN REFINE THIS 
<br>
LEGISLATION. BUT WE MUST ACT. THE UNITED STATES HAS MAYBE A 1-YEAR 
<br>
LEAD OVER OUR CLOSEST COMPETITORS IN THE HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING 
<br>
FIELD. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO HESITATE IN CRAFTING A BLUEPRINT TO ENSURE 
<br>
THAT LEAD FOR THE [*S16898] NEXT DOZEN YEARS OF THIS CENTURY AND TO 
<br>
POSITION OURSELVES FOR THE NEXT CENTURY. REPRESENTATIVES FROM 
<br>
INDUSTRY, ACADEMIA, AND FEDERAL AGENCIES SHOULD DISCUSS WHAT NEEDS TO 
<br>
BE DONE, USING THIS BILL AS A FRAMEWORK FOR ACTION.
<br>
<p>THE NATIONAL HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ACT OF 1988 WOULD 
<br>
EXPAND AND IMPROVE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND THE 
<br>
APPLICATION OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY. SPECIFICALLY, 
<br>
THIS ACT WOULD ESTABLISH A HIGH-CAPACITY NATIONAL RESEARCH COMPUTER 
<br>
NETWORK, DEVELOP AND DISTRIBUTE SOFTWARE, DEVELOP ARTIFICIAL 
<br>
INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMS, STIMULATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HARDWARE, AND 
<br>
INVEST IN BASIC RESEARCH AND EDUCATION.
<br>
<p>THE ACT WOULD DEFINE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN 
<br>
HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING. THE ACT WOULD PROVIDE FOR A 
<br>
3-GIGABIT-PER-SECOND NATIONAL NETWORK, DEVELOP FEDERAL STANDARDS, 
<br>
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT USER VIEWS, EXAMINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY, 
<br>
BUILD AN INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE COMPOSED OF DATA BASES AND 
<br>
KNOWLEDGE BANKS, CREATE A NATIONAL SOFTWARE CORPORATION TO DEVELOP 
<br>
IMPORTANT SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, ESTABLISH A CLEARINGHOUSE TO VALIDATE 
<br>
AND DISTRIBUTE SOFTWARE, PROMOTE ARTICIFIAL INTELLIGENCE DATA BASES, 
<br>
INCREASE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, STUDY EXPORT CONTROLS 
<br>
AFFECTING COMPUTERS, REVIEW PROCUREMENT POLICIES TO STIMULATE THE 
<br>
COMPUTER INDUSTRY, AND ENHANCE COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION PROGRAMS. 
<br>
IT ALSO CLEARLY DEFINES AGENCY MISSIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES WITH 
<br>
RESPECT TO HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING.
