<br>
Priced at $100 and designed for ages 3 and up, Rocket the Wonder Dog is a
<br>
decidedly more downscale dog. We didn't expect it to compete with a
<br>
technological purebred such as Sony's Aibo, but Rocket is one pathetic puppy.
<br>
<p>Perhaps Fisher-Price can do some tie-in with the re-release of The Exorcist,
<br>
since it seems the dog's designers were inspired by the movie. Various body
<br>
parts, such as the legs, can spin 360 degrees. If you happen to be holding
<br>
Rocket when this occurs, your hands get pinched between its legs and its body,
<br>
and as you let go in pain, it drops to the floor with a thud.
<br>
<p>Virtually every inch of Rocket is covered with moving parts -- mouth, eyes,
<br>
eyebrows and tail all move in different directions -- and the dog lets out a
<br>
continuous stream of pants, whines, barks, burps (yes, really) and the
<br>
occasional song. The overall effect is sure to drive parents to drop-kick the
<br>
dog.
<br>
<p>Rocket comes with a remote control and a headset that you can use to train it to
<br>
recognize its name and simple voice commands. When we first tried this, Rocket
<br>
just sat there scratching an ear and staring at us.
<br>
<p>We finally broke down and read the directions, but even then training was hit or
<br>
miss. As you speak commands into the microphone, the system reads them back in a
<br>
garbled voice that sounds something like the grown-ups in Charlie Brown
<br>
cartoons. Eventually, we were able to get Rocket to respond to a few commands
<br>
(&quot;Do Tricks&quot; seemed to be its specialty). But most of the time it seemed to have
<br>
a mind of its own.
<br>
<p>The most disappointing aspect of Rocket was its sluggishness. You'd think a dog
<br>
named Rocket with little rubber wheels for feet would have some speed. But this
<br>
thing is no greyhound. When it does decide to walk, it's about as fast as a
<br>
one-legged tortoise.
<br>
<p>As much as we'd like to see it now, our prediction is it'll be at least one dog
<br>
year before anyone comes up with a household robot that is both affordable and
<br>
worth owning. Sorry, Rocket.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
