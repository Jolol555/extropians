<p>Looking for Madam Tetrachromat
<br>
Do mutant females walk among us?
<br>
<p>By Glenn Zorpette
<br>
<em>&gt;From the December 04, 2000 issue 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Oh, everyone knows my color vision is different,&quot; chuckles Mrs. M, a
<br>
57-year-old English social worker.  &quot;People will think things match,
<br>
but I can see they don't.&quot; What you wouldn't give to see the world
<br>
through her deep blue-gray eyes, if only for five minutes.
<br>
<p>Preliminary evidence gathered at Cambridge University in 1993 suggests
<br>
that this woman is a tetrachromat, perhaps the most remarkable human
<br>
mutant ever identified. Most of us have color vision based on three
<br>
channels; a tetrachromat has four.
<br>
<p>The theoretical possibility of this secret sorority -- genetics
<br>
dictates that tetrachromats would all be female -- has intrigued
<br>
scientists since it was broached in 1948. Now two scientists, working
<br>
separately, plan to search systematically for tetrachromats to
<br>
determine once and for all whether they exist and whether they see
<br>
more colors than the rest of us do. The scientists are building on a
<br>
raft of recent findings about the biology of color vision.
<br>
<p>The breakthroughs come just in time.  &quot;Computers, color monitors, and
<br>
the World Wide Web have made having color blindness a much bigger deal
<br>
than it ever was before,&quot; says Jay Neitz, a molecular biologist who
<br>
studies color vision at the Medical College of Wisconsin in
<br>
Milwaukee. Color-blind individuals, he explains, often lose their way
<br>
while navigating the Web's thicket of color cues and
<br>
codes. &quot;Color-blind people complain miserably about the Web because
<br>
they can't get the color code,&quot; Dr. Neitz says. (Just try surfing on a
<br>
monochrome monitor.)
<br>
<p>Most people are trichromats, with retinas having three kinds of color
<br>
sensors, called cone photopigments -- those for red, green, and
<br>
blue. The 8 percent of men who are color-blind typically have the cone
<br>
photopigment for blue but are either missing one of the other colors,
<br>
or the men have them, in effect, for two very slightly different reds
<br>
or greens. A tetrachromat would have a fourth cone photopigment, for a
<br>
color between red and green.
<br>
<p>Besides the philosophical interest in learning something new about
<br>
perception, the brain, and the evolution of our species, finding a
<br>
tetrachromat would also offer a practical reward. It would prove that
<br>
the human nervous system can adapt to new capabilities.  Flexibility
<br>
matters greatly in a number of scenarios envisaged for gene therapy.
<br>
For example, if someone with four kinds of color photopigments cannot
<br>
see more colors than others, it would imply that the human nervous
<br>
system cannot easily take advantage of genetic interventions.
<br>
<p>For years now, scientists have known that some fraction of women have
<br>
four different cone photopigments in their retinas. The question still
<br>
remains, however, whether any of these females have the neural
<br>
circuitry that enables them to enjoy a different -- surely richer --
<br>
visual experience than the common run of humanity sees. &quot;If we could
<br>
identify these tetrachromats, it would speak directly to the ability
<br>
of the brain to organize itself to take advantage of novel stimuli,&quot;
<br>
says Dr. Neitz. &quot;It would make us a lot more optimistic about doing a
<br>
gene therapy for color blindness.&quot;
<br>
<p>There have been very few attempts to find Madam Tetrachromat. The one
<br>
that turned up Mrs. M in England, in 1993, was led by Gabriele Jordan,
<br>
then at Cambridge University and now at the University of
<br>
Newcastle. She tested the color perception of 14 women who each had at
<br>
least one son with a specific type of color blindness. She looked at
<br>
those women because genetics implies that the mothers of color-blind
<br>
boys may have genetic peculiarities of their own.  Among that somewhat
<br>
peculiar group of women, one could expect to find the odd
<br>
tetrachromat.
<br>
<p>It's almost as if the supersense these women enjoy comes at the
<br>
expense of the men in their families. &quot;I'm just sorry I've robbed my
<br>
son of one of his color waves,&quot; Mrs. M says.
<br>
<p>Dr. Jordan reports that of the fourteen test subjects in her study,
<br>
two showed &quot;exactly&quot; the behavior that would be expected of
<br>
tetrachromats. &quot;It was very strong evidence for tetrachromacy,&quot; she
<br>
adds. The apparent tetrachromats were Mrs. M, who was identified in
<br>
the study as cDA1, and another candidate, cDA7.
<br>
<p>Dr. Jordan set up an experiment in which subjects tried to determine
<br>
whether a pair of colored lights matched. They used joysticks to blend
<br>
two different wavelengths as they pleased. The resulting hues lay
<br>
outside the spectrum of the blue photoreceptor, rendering it nearly
<br>
useless, so that normal trichromats would have the use of only their
<br>
red and green photoreceptors. Having hit upon a color, the subjects
<br>
would then try to reproduce it by mixing two other wavelengths.
<br>
Because the tetrachromats had the use of only two receptors, they
<br>
found a whole slew of mixes that produced a matching color.
<br>
<p>However, any tetrachromat should have been able to use three receptors
<br>
in this color space, and therefore make a single, precise match. In
<br>
the experiment, cDA1 and cDA7 performed pretty much as a tetrachromat
<br>
would be expected to.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, Dr. Jordan declines to say that she has finally found a
<br>
tetrachromat, partly because her testing is still a work in
<br>
progress. The vast majority of us have no idea what tetrachromacy
<br>
would be like. Anyone who had the supersense wouldn't know she did,
<br>
let alone be able to describe it.  After all, it is an exercise in
<br>
futility for trichromats to try to explain their visual experience to
<br>
color-blind people.
<br>
<p>Dr. Neitz and Dr. Jordan each plan a more definitive search for
<br>
tetrachromats. Dr. Neitz plans to take advantage of the fuller
<br>
understanding of the underlying genetics of color vision.  His will be
<br>
the first experiment that will use genetic techniques to identify
<br>
women with four different color photopigments.
<br>
<p>What will he be looking for? Let's start with the basics. The genes
<br>
for the red and green photopigments are adjacent to each other on the
<br>
X chromosome; strangely, blue is way off by itself on another
<br>
chromosome. Women, of course, have two X chromosomes and therefore two
<br>
sets of red and green photopigment genes. Men have only one X, so they
<br>
have just one shot at getting the red and green photopigment genes
<br>
right.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately for men, it turns out that those genes are prone to a
<br>
kind of mutation that occurs when eggs are formed in a female
<br>
embryo. When the eggs are created, the X chromosomes from the maternal
<br>
grandmother and grandfather mix with each other in random places to
<br>
make the egg's brand-new X chromosome. Because the genes for the red
<br>
and green photopigments are right next to each other, those genes
<br>
sometimes mix.  That's perfectly normal. But every once in a while,
<br>
the mixing occurs in a lopsided way, and the result, 30 years later,
<br>
could very well be a man who has to check with his wife every time he
<br>
dresses.
<br>
<p>A lopsided mix can have three outcomes: (1) the egg in the embryo has
<br>
an X chromosome that's missing either a red or a green photopigment
<br>
gene, (2) the X chromosome has two slightly different red photopigment
<br>
genes, or (3) the X chromosome has two slightly different green
<br>
photopigment genes. In any of these cases, if that egg gets fertilized
<br>
and becomes a male, the man will get that X chromosome and be
<br>
color-blind.
<br>
<p>Here it gets interesting. Suppose a woman inherits one X chromosome
<br>
with two slightly different green photopigment genes. And let's say
<br>
her other X chromosome has the normal complement of red and green
<br>
photopigment genes. Because of a well-known biological phenomenon
<br>
called X inactivation -- which causes some cells to rely on one X
<br>
chromosome and others to rely on the other -- that woman's retinas
<br>
would have four different types of photopigments: blue, red, green,
<br>
and the slightly shifted green.  (It would also be possible, through a
<br>
different genetic sequence, to produce blue, green, red, and a shifted
<br>
red.) X inactivation is only possible in women, so there has never
<br>
been, and probably never will be, a male tetrachromat.
<br>
<p>True tetrachromacy would require a few other characteristics in
<br>
addition to retinas with four different photopigment receptors. For
<br>
instance, there would have to be four neural channels to convey to the
<br>
brain the sensory inputs from the four receptors, and the brain's
<br>
visual cortex would have to be able to handle this four-channel
<br>
system. If a woman were born with four types of photopigments, would
<br>
her brain wire itself to take advantage of them? No one knows for
<br>
sure, but some experts strongly suspect it would. &quot;Yes, definitely,&quot;
<br>
says Jeremy Nathans, a pioneer in color-vision research at Johns
<br>
Hopkins University School of Medicine. One reason to think so is the
<br>
brain's great plasticity in other respects.  People with special
<br>
skills -- musicians, bilinguals, deaf people who learn sign language
<br>
-- often show characteristic brain patterns.
<br>
<p>Dr. Nathans also believes, however, that for full-blown tetrachromacy,
<br>
the fourth photopigment must not have a peak in sensitivity that is
<br>
too close to the peaks of either the red or the green
<br>
photopigments. That's the rub, as far as he's concerned -- he suspects
<br>
that most female tetrachromats would have only mildly superior color
<br>
vision, because the genetics indicates that the fourth photopigment
<br>
would almost always be very close to either the red or the green.
<br>
Every now and then, however, an oddball photopigment might appear,
<br>
well separated from both red and green.  &quot;The genetics do not rule it
<br>
out,&quot; Dr.  Nathans explains. &quot;It would be a rare event. But who's to
<br>
say it hasn't happened? There are a lot of people out there.&quot;
<br>
<p>That idea finds support in the recent discoveries about the genetics
<br>
of color vision, many made by Dr. Neitz's group.  Those findings have
<br>
shown that the genetics underlying color vision are surprisingly
<br>
variable, even within the narrow range regarded as normal. &quot;The
<br>
variety in photopigment genes in people with normal color vision is
<br>
enormous,&quot; Dr. Neitz reports. &quot;It's enormous.&quot;
<br>
<p>Would there be any practical advantages to tetrachromacy? Dr. Jordan
<br>
notes that a mother could more easily spot when her children were pale
<br>
or flushed, and therefore ill. Mrs. M reports that she has always been
<br>
able to match even subtle colors from memory -- buying a bag, for
<br>
example, to match shoes she hasn't laid eyes on for months. And
<br>
computers, color monitors, and the Internet raise a whole raft of
<br>
possibilities. Just as someone with normal three-color vision surfs
<br>
rings around a dichromat on the Internet, a tetrachromat, looking at a
<br>
special computer screen based on four primary colors rather than the
<br>
standard three, could theoretically dump data into her head faster
<br>
than the rest of us.
<br>
<p>If Dr. Neitz or Dr. Jordan finally finds Madam Tetrachromat, the
<br>
discovery will confirm that the human nervous system can handle
<br>
four-channel color vision. And that confirmation would raise the
<br>
possibility that, within a couple of decades, gene therapy will make
<br>
tetrachromacy just another option that wealthy parents could check off
<br>
on the list when they are designing their daughters.
<br>
<p>It won't be possible with male children -- not for quite some time,
<br>
anyway. So as long as we're on this flight of fancy, let's take one
<br>
more short hop: a few decades from now, men and women will still be
<br>
seeing the world differently. But the expression might not be merely
<br>
figurative any more.
