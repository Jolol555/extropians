<em>&gt; I also sometimes notice additional information from wearing polarized

</em><br>
<p>This is probably caused by the two polarizing lenses being slightly
<br>
misaligned.  Glancing reflected light tends to be polarized, and so
<br>
if the two eyes have polarizers with different orientations then the
<br>
relative brightness between the leaf and the ground will be different
<br>
with your two eyes.  Your brain is apparently presenting this oddity as
<br>
a peculiar sheen.
<br>
<p>Another interesting experiment would be to go around for a few days
<br>
with those red-blue 3D glasses on.  I know, it sounds like a headache,
<br>
but probably after a while you'd get used to it and perceive some degree
<br>
of normal color vision.  You'd have less color perception rather than
<br>
more, but I suspect that you would feel that you were seeing somewhat
<br>
normal colors.  Just a guess though -
