<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wow. Tremendous post. What a perfect example of eactly what we are up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Though I admire the depth of vision and imaginative genius on display in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;this work I have many problems with its philosophical underpinnings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Broderick, and the scientists he discusses, seem to have little conception
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of old age and death as necessary parts of the human life cycle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am stunned almost speechless by the depth of the gulf between his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and ours. When I hear someone who is apparently educated and well-read make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this statement, and realize that the vast majority of humans share his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;viewpoint, I wonder if we have any real chance to win them over, ever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Perhaps the old saying about how new ideas win acceptance--the holders of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the idea paradigm simply die out, leaving the field open for the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;--is completely correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The tone of the review was more that of someone trying to convince himself 
<br>
of what he's saying.
<br>
The kind of attitude expressed is not surprising and it's easy to see how it 
<br>
comes about. As long as people have existed, death has been inevitable (and 
<br>
even with billion year+ lifespans, it is still something which will 
<br>
eventually happen). Those who accept this hideous inevitability as &quot;a 
<br>
neccessary part of life&quot;, thus desirable, probably were the ones better at 
<br>
coping with their own morality, and the deaths of others around them. I saw 
<br>
this documentary, &quot;Sick: The life and death of bob flanagan, 
<br>
supermasochist&quot;, about a guy with Cystic Fibrosis, constantly in pain since 
<br>
childhood, who became a masochistic performance artist, doing things on 
<br>
stage which would kill me if I did them. It's the same mechanism, you try to 
<br>
turn something you can't get away from into something you love, something 
<br>
you wouldn't give up for the world, a neccessary part of the grand cycle of 
<br>
life.
