<br>
or nanoflechette guns, is it really appropriate for like 20% of this list's 
<br>
traffic to be about this piece of 1920s technology? Aren't there forums 
<br>
specifically devoted to gun rights? If there are no appropriate ones, perhaps 
<br>
it's time to start an exi-guns list. I'll certainly join.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Alex, you know that you are absolutely right.  Far too much time is spent 
<br>
discussing guns; not only on this list but on other lists.  But, if you will 
<br>
notice the anti gun zealots are always the ones that introduce the subject.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever tried to end one of these threads.  The zealots will be be 
<br>
right back with the latest set of statistics from their anti-gun sites, the 
<br>
latest set of arguments to explain away the constitution and they will go on 
<br>
&amp; on.  Then you pick up the paper and see the evidence that their high level 
<br>
supports and spokesmen have not given up their guns.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish we could drop the argument.  I totally support the right to own 
<br>
guns including semi automatic civilian versions of military weapons, I don't 
<br>
shoot, I have no interest in shooting and I don't belong to the NRA but I get 
<br>
tired of listening to those guys.
