<em>&gt; &gt;Isn't the notion of the &quot;media&quot; becoming obsolete in this day of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;user to user communications?  I don't think we can usefully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;distinguish between the media and ordinary people, when anyone can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;publish and share his observations via the Internet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Internet is not primarily a broadcast media.
</em><br>
<p>Well, one use of the Internet is for publishing web pages, which is
<br>
akin to broadcasting.  Presumably your ban would need to apply to web
<br>
publishers in addition to TV, right?
<br>
<p>An interesting example in the recent election was Matt Drudge,
<br>
whose site drudgereport.com published the early exit poll results,
<br>
contravening the stated policy of the consortium which conducted the
<br>
polls, Voter News Service.  He may still get sued for this, we'll see.
<br>
Would you muzzle Matt Drudge?  Is he merely an influential individual,
<br>
or does he count as a broadcaster?  How to decide?  What happens as
<br>
others become successful publishing their own opinions?
<br>
<p>I don't see how you can draw a meaningful line between individuals and
<br>
the media, given that there are a number of influential individuals
<br>
(and you can bet that more such personal sites would spring up if you
<br>
did succeed in quashing media discussion).  Then there are discussion
<br>
groups like alt.politics (which is actually where I found Drudge's
<br>
reports, his site was overloaded all day), chat rooms and a host of
<br>
other communication options.
<br>
<p>Face it, the future is moving towards increased information flow.
<br>
Any proposal to limit political discussion is a non-starter, IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Ultimately the question is whether to try to limit the flow of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;information. It's true that people's behavior may change if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;know more about what is going on, including how people are voting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;during the course of election day.  But IMO we have to accept this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;kind of change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's trying to limit the negative effect of information during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voting hours only. Can you suggest a positive use for this flow?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; During the voting hours only?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the burden of proof ought to be on someone justifying
<br>
a positive use for people being able to communicate with each other.
<br>
Rather, you need to show that there is very significant harm in allowing
<br>
them to do so, in order to justify muzzling their natural ability to
<br>
communicate.
<br>
<p>Why should we restrict people from learning how others are voting?
<br>
What is the harm?
<br>
<p>If it really were so harmful, shouldn't we disallow pre-election polling?
<br>
That gives people an idea about how others should vote.  Granted it is
<br>
not as accurate, but as we have seen, same-day reports are not always
<br>
100% accurate either (Drudge had Florida going overwhelmingly for Gore,
<br>
which is why the networks called it 15 minutes after most but not all
<br>
of the polls closed).
<br>
<p>Even if such information influences votes, don't people have the right
<br>
to use whatever information they choose in making decisions?  What gives
<br>
us the omniscience to say that the world would be a better place if each
<br>
person were to decide without any information about what others are doing?
<br>
<p>There is plenty of experimental and theoretical reason to think that
<br>
giving people the maximum of information will help them.  Take the famous
<br>
Delphi system, in which experts are polled, and then given feedback about
<br>
what other experts said in order to revise their estimates.  The feedback
<br>
is said to greatly improve accuracy.  Or look at the theoretical results
<br>
in which social information institutions evolve to be trustworthy so that
<br>
average individuals don't have to be experts on everything in order to
<br>
still make decent decisions.  People implicitly rely on the judgement
<br>
of their fellows being roughly accurate most of the time.
<br>
<p>It seems to me to be contrary to the principle of respect for individual
<br>
autonomy to try to put a ban like this into place.  Better to let people
<br>
decide for themselves what information they want to use.
<br>
