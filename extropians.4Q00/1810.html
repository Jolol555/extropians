<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Grain finished beef tastes better and is more tender, regardless of thespecies of grain used.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know the biochemical differences between corn and other grains like wheat or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rice, but it is the newest major domesticated grain, and thus the least likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for humans or their domesticated animals to be adapted to digesting efficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or healthfully.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Corn is at least 7000 years old versus wheat/barley ~10000. I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's a big difference. And, of course, humans and animals ate the wild
</em><br>
<em>&gt; varieties long before they were domesticated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American farmers use corn to finish cattle for one reason: cost.
</em><br>
<p>As I said, it is most profitable for farmers to do so. 
<br>
Now, corn, up until 500 years ago was completely unknown to anyone but Native
<br>
Americans and Llamas. Caucasoid, African, Asian and even Australian and
<br>
polynesian people have had no experience with it prior to that. Moreover, up
<br>
until 500 years ago, maize was a pretty pathetic little thing compared to the
<br>
atom bomb of sugars and starches it is now. As I said, it is least likely for
<br>
humans or their domesticated animals to be adapted to digesting efficiently or
<br>
healthfully.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can understand the draw, as I appreciate the taste of a couple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ears of ripe Butter and Sugar corn in a nice fall barbecue, but I'm sure if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; given the chance I'd develop a taste for crack if I could legally buy a dozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hits for a dollar. Thats essentially what corn is: its the crack cocaine of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; domesticated grains, and nearly as bad for you as cane sugar.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why do you say that? As far as I can tell, corn, barley, and rice are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strikingly similar, nutrionally. For example, see:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://waltonfeed.com/self/ntr3.html">http://waltonfeed.com/self/ntr3.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>Where then is the wheat, rice, and barley syrup? Corn is higher in sugar (I
<br>
notice the page you referenced does not break down the carbohydrates at all),
<br>
and is also very low in thiamin, niacin, and calcium compared to the others,
<br>
though it is well endowed with Vitamin A. The sugar is the big thing, most
<br>
cornfed cows are sugar junkies, this I know from experience, since if given the
<br>
opportunity they will prefer cereal surplus even over well fermented silage (the
<br>
apple jacks and other cinnamon cereals do tend to pass the cinnamon through to
<br>
the milk, though). They are essentially couch potato junk food junkies. I'll bet
<br>
if you had a cannibal feeding off couch potatos, he would have the exact same
<br>
health problems as someone who lived off cornfed cattle.
<br>
Not for me. I want my meat from lean athletic animals that work for a living
<br>
(and work out all day). Fish swim all day, grouse, woodcock, duck, geese, and
<br>
wild turkey all scratch out their living in the wild, deer get chased around
<br>
pretty thoroughly by dogs, coyotes, cars, and any odd sound that sets them into
<br>
hysterics, while moose are constantly working the swamp wading treadmill, and
<br>
caribou are the long distance kings. 
<br>
<p>You may have hormone and chemical free cattle, but unless they walk at least a
<br>
few miles a day and live off the land, I'm not interested. Sure I'm an odd
<br>
customer in today's society, but until some farmers, at least, are producing
<br>
truly natural beef, then it will continue to be the dioxin of the human diet,
<br>
and vegans arguments will continue to have merit. Will people be willing to pay
<br>
the price? I don't know. Currently its cheaper for me to go shoot a deer or
<br>
moose or other wild animal than to buy the same weight in beef from the store,
<br>
and I get free exercise in the outdoors doing so as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Just out of curiosity--I don't doubt your word--but what measurable benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; can you attribute to cutting out 5-10% beef?  And what is the basis of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; percentage: calories of total diet, protein by weight, or what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can't tell you any specifics. I cut it out, and I'm now much better for it. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't count calories or weigh myself, as I don't want to develop any obsessive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; behaviors in my diet... It is, though, difficult to not notice a difference in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; waist size of four inches.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, that's great, but you haven't identified the basis of the 5-10% number.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5-10% of *what* by *what* was beef?
</em><br>
<p>5-10% of my meat, by weight.
