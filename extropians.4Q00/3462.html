Michael M. Buttler quotes Ted Nelson at
<br>
<a href="http://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~ted/TN/WRITINGS/TCOMPARADIGM/tedCompOneLiners.html">http://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~ted/TN/WRITINGS/TCOMPARADIGM/tedCompOneLiners.html</a>

<em>&gt; &quot;The Xanadu® project did not 'fail to invent HTML'.  HTML is precisely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we were trying to PREVENT-- ever-breaking links, links going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outward only, quotes you can't follow to their origins, no version
</em><br>
<em>&gt; management, no rights management.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I've been reading the ideas of Tim Berners-Lee, the man who can rightly be
<br>
said to have invented the web.  The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) he
<br>
founded is now promoting XML as a lingua franca for the web.  Lee sees
<br>
XML as a way to promote automated web reading, so that web pages can
<br>
present data in machine-readable XML which is automatically translated
<br>
to nice looking HTML for humans.  The result will be that both humans
<br>
and their software agents can browse the web with ease.  Lee calls this
<br>
the &quot;Semantic Web&quot; and describes it as an important part of his initial
<br>
vision of what the web could become.
<br>
<p>Associated with XML is the linking spec, XLink, which lets you set up
<br>
hyperlinks between XML documents.  This is intended to address many of
<br>
the deficiencies with HTML linking.  The XLink Design Principles have
<br>
a number of interesting points.  Some excerpts:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 XLink Shall Be Straightforwardly Usable Over the Internet
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a requirement to allow for &quot;open systems&quot; of linking where
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not all resources are under the control of a single person or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organization (along with easier &quot;closed systems&quot;). For example,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broken links must be tolerated.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both unidirectional links (common on the Web today) and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multidirectional links (commonly used in commercial hypermedia
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;systems) must be supported.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2 XLink Shall Be Usable by a Wide Variety of Link Usage Domains
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of Classes of Linking Application Software
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLink should not favor particular domains over others. For example,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it should be usable in scholarly annotation, cross-referencing in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technical publications, and other domains of link usage.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3 The XLink Expression Language Shall Be XML
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.4 The XLink Design Shall Be Prepared Quickly
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5 The XLink Design Shall Be Formal and Concise
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.6 XLinks Shall Be Human-Readable
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.7 XLinks May Reside Outside the Documents in Which the Participating
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources Reside
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a requirement that XLink provide a means to do sophisticated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out-of-line linking, in order for it to offer scalability and relief
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from HTML linking problems. This does not mean that all links must
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be out-of-line; on the contrary, the &quot;Straightforwardly Usable Over
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Internet&quot; principle demands that simple in-line linking also
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be accounted for.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.8 XLink Shall Represent the Abstract Structure and Significance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Links
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.9 XLink Must Be Feasible to Implement
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a nongoal for XLink to be easy to implement because we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recognize that certain functionality, in particular out-of-line link
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;handling with extended document groups, is inherently difficult. Our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goal is to make implementation at least tractable; that is, we must
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider implementability in our deliberations.
<br>
<p>For more information on these new technologies, see www.w3.org.  I have
<br>
found the tutorials at www.xml.com to be useful as well.
