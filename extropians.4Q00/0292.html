<p>
As fascinating as the debate has been between Speer as the sole authority
<br>
on Nazi economic policy, versus the enormous body of academic research on
<br>
the precise degree of capitalist/financier/industrialist complicity in the
<br>
rise and rule of the Nazis, it really misses my point.
<br>
<p>Capitalism as a system has always required coercion, i.e. governments,
<br>
simply to exist, if only to enforce contracts. And as attractive as the
<br>
libertarian fantasy of reducing governance to simply the enforcement of
<br>
contracts might seem, real-existing capitalism, dominated by various kinds
<br>
of capitalists in alliance with various kinds of military thugs, fascist
<br>
thugs, liberal democratic polities, and all the other forces of modern
<br>
politics - real capitalists have always used the coercive aparatus of the
<br>
State in far more extensive ways than libertarians would like. Which is why
<br>
very few capitalists have ever been consistent libertarians.
<br>
<p>Capitalists are by definition interested in making profit, not in
<br>
maximizing the greatest good through libertarian or democratic social
<br>
policy. Different groups of capitalists respond to the economic and
<br>
political terrains they face in different ways. Sometimes things are so
<br>
dire they think their best bets are with backing military dictators,
<br>
religious zealots, and racist demoagogues in order to squash trade unions
<br>
and leftist parties. Sometimes they think backing democratic or even
<br>
populist politicians is the best way to stabilize their economies, achieve
<br>
social peace, fund education, health and other social investments important
<br>
for a healthy workforce, etc. But in the end, the &quot;bottom line&quot; for people
<br>
who control finance and industrial capital, i.e. the owning classes, is
<br>
what will make profit, and maintain and reproduce their wealth.
<br>
<p>Libertarian policy, such as a laissez-faire attitude towards monopolies or
<br>
dropping prescriptive control of drugs, in many cases has been been as
<br>
violently opposed as social democratic policy by real-existing capitalists
<br>
in real-existing capitalism, precisely because it threatens the
<br>
profit-making of existing capitalists. To define slavery and slave camp
<br>
labor as not really capitalist since it involves coercion, therefore, is
<br>
absurd. Coercive labor, which includes killing labor organizers,
<br>
union-busting, and so on, is not libertarian or democratic, but is
<br>
definitely capitalist.
<br>
<p>Finally, as for the equation of social democracy with Communism and Nazism
<br>
because the Nazis appropriated some aspects of socialist symbology and
<br>
policy, thats just silly. First, the Nazis rounded up and executed hundreds
<br>
of thousands of socialists, communists and trade unionists. Secondly, the
<br>
Communists rounded up and executed hundreds of thousands of social
<br>
democrats and trade unionists. And thats because they had diametrically
<br>
opposed social policy goals:
<br>
<p>Nazis: Europe/world united under the leadership of a German,
<br>
racial-nationalist one-party state, with corporatist, but nonetheless
<br>
privately owned, economy.
<br>
<p>Communists: World united under a set of one-party communist states with
<br>
state-owned industry
<br>
<p>Social democracy: Independent multi-party, democratic countries with mixed
<br>
economies 
<br>
<p>Anyone who tries to tell you these three social systems were basically same
<br>
thing because they weren't anarcho-capitalism isn't contributing
<br>
meaningfully to the conversation.
