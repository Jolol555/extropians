<em>&gt;&gt;I just heard this news item while driving, but missed the name of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;governor (I think it was a governor) proposing the idea. I'm hoping 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;can fill in the details. The governor of whichever state was seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;proposing to deal with the problem of possible mistakes in administering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the death penalty by putting those executed into cryonic suspension.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;According to the report, the governor was completely serious and simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;thinking outside the box&quot; (his words).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I'd *really* like to find out who he is and in which state, as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;monitor the responses. Whether you are for or against the death penalty, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;administered by the government, I think this is a positive thing--it sends
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the message that an &quot;official&quot; sees cryonic suspension as holding out real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;hope.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, if this idea were implemented, it would probably &quot;make&quot; cryonics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here's an excerpt from the news story:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mayor suggests cryogenically freezing death row inmates
</em><br>
<p>I hate when they call it &quot;cryogenics&quot; instead of &quot;cryonics&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — To the growing death penalty debate, a mayor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;submitted this suggestion: put inmates on ice — literally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;During a city council meeting, Mayor Keith Holliday said Tuesday that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worry over executing innocent people could be resolved by cryogenically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freezing death row inmates, then reversing the process if later evidence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clears them of crimes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Several council members laughed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But Holliday said he wasn't joking. He said the technology had been the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subject of a television talk show he had watched.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;I'm just trying to think outside the box,&quot; he said.

<p><p>Do you have a link for the whole article (or is it only in print)?
<br>
I do not think this will be implemented. Nevertheless, I recommend that 
<br>
those of us who are of the highest social standing (certainly not me) get in 
<br>
touch with this Mayor, encourage him, congradulate him, move to Greensboro 
<br>
NC and vote for him, and maybe get him signed up for cryonics.
<br>
If it were implemented then I see a huge potential for backlash - capital 
<br>
punishment protesters saying that it will never work and the government is 
<br>
just trying to assuage their guilt over killing innocent people - and they'd 
<br>
be mostly right, we all know cryonics is risky at best (I speak as someone 
<br>
who is signed up), and it would be mainly a propoganda tool. It would be 
<br>
recognized as such and attacked, and the attack could spread to the concept 
<br>
of cryonics itself.
<br>
I had an interesting idea a while ago relating to this - what if a 
<br>
(admittedly guilty) death row prisoner signed up for cryonics? Would the 
<br>
government allow him to do so? Would they take care in executing him to 
<br>
damage his brain as little as possible, and let Alcor in quickly to do the 
<br>
work? Would Alcor even take this case? In a few centuries or decades, would 
<br>
he be allowed to be revived? Would the family of the victim sue Alcor at any 
<br>
point along the way?
<br>
Here's another thing, imagine that a (claiming to be innocent) death row 
<br>
inmate signs up for cryonics, is not allowed to, but takes it to court and 
<br>
wins, using the same argument as Mayor Holliday? This introduces cryonics to 
<br>
anti-death penalty activists and makes it an anti-death penalty cause (who 
<br>
wants to write Mumia and offer to pay for his suspension?). Then, suppose 
<br>
that after execution, he turns out to actually be proven innocent - this 
<br>
places a perceived (by the public) moral burden on the government to come up 
<br>
with some way to revive the executed individual, especially if it becomes a 
<br>
widespread thing with a lot of people in suspension.
<br>
But I worry a lot about more publicity for cryonics in today's climate. 
<br>
Would anyone really be surprised to hear tommorow that Janet Reno is 
<br>
ordering the dismantling of all cryonics institutions and the thawing and 
<br>
&quot;proper burial&quot; of all the &quot;Defrauded victims of this scam&quot;? And would the 
<br>
general public take a rebuttal seriously?
<br>
Here is a sci-fi Machiavellian ploy I just though of and not to be taken as 
<br>
a serious proposal: let's get three of us together who are terminally ill 
<br>
(or just have death wishes). The first one will kill the second, and frame 
<br>
the third. The third will go along with it, hire a hack lawyer, be declared 
<br>
guilty, and get the death penalty (do it in Texas and make sure participant 
<br>
number one is black and participants number two is a cop). He'll sign up for 
<br>
cryonics and win a lawsuit. After he is frozen, the actual killer comes 
<br>
forward to confess to the murder, and there we have a known innocent death 
<br>
penalty victim frozen, and a cause celebre for cryonics.
