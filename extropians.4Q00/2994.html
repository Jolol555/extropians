<p>I think it goes beyond implication. People *do* en masse abandon all
<br>
decency and history and respect for each other. It happened in Germany (a
<br>
very highly civilized country I'm told) and I don't believe the US is
<br>
immune to this mass socio-genic illness.

<p><em>&gt;a rather strange opinion in a list

players)
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Difference is that it doesn't cost anything to vote. (In Australia it
<br>
costs *not* to vote.) If people had to pay directly for government, all
<br>
ideas of democracy would instantly change.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;True, most markets are highly asymmetrical in

<br>

</em><br>
<p>That's right. Poor people can't afford the luxury of moralism that rich
<br>
folks advertise.
<br>
&quot;It's illegal for both the beggar and the billionaire to steal a loaf of
<br>
bread&quot; but the fact that a billionaire doesn't steal a loaf of bread
<br>
doesn't make him as moral as the beggar who also suppresses the urge to
<br>
steal it.
<br>
<p>Pure democracy is based on the false premise of equality. The truth is
<br>
that we are not all created equal, and even if we were, we sure don't stay
<br>
that way.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,

<p>&quot;It is enough that the people know there was an election.
<br>
The people who cast the votes decide nothing.

The people who count the votes decide everything.&quot; --Joseph Stalin
