<em>&gt; Spike Jones reminisces about the present,  &gt;Corey, extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; notions do not require extropian missionaries.  All those ideas are

<p>You are too kind, J.R.
<br>
<p>While on vacation we visited my wife's grandmother.  I got in a discussion
<br>
with her on cryonics.  She is a coverted Seventh Day Adventist, having
<br>
been raised Mormon.  82 years old, mind in excellent shape, body
<br>
deteriorating.  We discussed cryonics, but I did not manage to get her
<br>
to sign on, even if I pay all expenses.  She would agree that *everything*
<br>
is waaaaay better now than in previous times in her life, and would
<br>
agree that life will continue to get better and that science will continue
<br>
to advance and even that cryonics might work.  But oddly enough
<br>
she still didnt see it as compatible with her religion, even without a
<br>
clear reason.  She just knew it was wrong.  {8-[
<br>
<p>I am reminded of those religious groups in India that believe
<br>
cobras are sacred.  Many of these people die of cobra bites.
<br>
This is a clear case where a religious notion is harmful to the
<br>
wellbeing of the mind in which it resides.  The anti-cryonics
<br>
grandmother would be another example.  spike
