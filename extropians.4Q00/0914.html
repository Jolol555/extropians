</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; You really don't know, huh?

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not much imagination.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Just to get you started:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Wishing you could die when you can't die is worse than death.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find it odd that so many people in the world think that living is the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important thing, to the exclusion of all else. For me, liberty and intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are more important than life, as I would fight and die to resist any attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remove either from me.
</em><br>
<p>You cannot be free, and you cannot exercise your intelligence if you
<br>
are dead. Furthermore, whether or not you guys or some SI holding me
<br>
captive thinks escape or hope are possible, I can still contemplate
<br>
escape and hope. If my faculties for thinking, remembering, or feeling
<br>
anything other than the pain to which I am being subjected are
<br>
temporarily switched off, there is still the faintest ghost of a
<br>
possibility that some turn of events will get those faculties switched
<br>
back on[1]. If they are permanently, irrevocably switched of... i.e.
<br>
destroyed, making me nothing more than a pain-bot, then I suppose I'd
<br>
be indifferent to being dead because as a sentience that limited I'll
<br>
already be dead for practical purposes. So, I suppose that if you
<br>
permanently destroy enough of my brain you'll eventually get me to be
<br>
okay with getting killed... but that will happen a long time after
<br>
you've already gotten me to be okay with the idea that the sun being
<br>
made from Jell-o.
<br>
<p>Also, there is the question of what level of complexity one has to be
<br>
for pain to have meaning. If I am reduced to nothing more than pain
<br>
neurocircuitry, will &quot;I&quot; truly feel the full intensity of that pain,
<br>
anymore than an olfactory system devorced from any higher functionality
<br>
truly smell?
<br>
<p>[1] For the record-- if you ever see me lying in a deep coma and some
<br>
'concerned', 'ethical' physician asking whether I'd perhaps prefer to
<br>
die with dignity and forego 'heroic measures', if you're a buddy of
<br>
mine, you'll stand up and say &quot;He'd want every heroic measure you've
<br>
got and dignity can wait. Shove tubes into and out of every orifice in
<br>
his body and drill as many new ones as you need to. Some people wake
<br>
out of coma.&quot;
