<p>
A possible solution to the problem of last-minute voting in an election
<br>
protocol which permits vote-switching:
<br>
<p>Have a non-predetermined cutoff time.  That way, anyone who tries to vote at
<br>
the last minute is gambling with their vote.  If they switch their vote too
<br>
late, they lose their vote (or wind up voting for whomever they voted for
<br>
originally); if they switch their vote early, then others will have time to
<br>
react, which is a desirable property of the system.
<br>
<p>So there are four days in which you can vote over the Internet; then three
<br>
days following, the Days of Uncertainty, in which your ability to vote could
<br>
be cut off at any moment - as determined by random-number generators or
<br>
lottery balls or (most preferable of all) Schrodinger's Cat or similar
<br>
non-tamperable non-predictable protocols.  The four original days should be
<br>
enough for all legitimate purposes, like switching your vote to a main party
<br>
if the third-party thing didn't work out, with the three days following enough
<br>
for honest folk to respond to genuine last-minute developments, while
<br>
discouraging maliciously last-minute voting.
<br>
<p>Hey, maybe that protocol would work for Ebay... the last three hours are
<br>
Random Death time, producing a sustained frenzy of desperate bidding (each
<br>
moment might be the last!) while giving the other bidders time to respond
<br>
(probably!).  If anyone turns this into a new e-commerce site, I get 0.5% of
<br>
the stock.  (If anyone tries to patent it, I'll have your guts for prior art.)
<br>
<p>(Hmmm... while I'm on the subject, another thing Ebay could try is a system
<br>
whereby each new bid extends the deadline to five minutes beyond the time of
<br>
that bid, with a final cutoff point of one hour after the original closing
<br>
time.  Those last-minute trumps are incredibly annoying.  And no, the &quot;highest
<br>
bid you're willing to make&quot; system isn't the same - not psychologically,
<br>
certainly.  Rarely does someone really know, down to the dollar, how much ve's
<br>
willing to pay...)
