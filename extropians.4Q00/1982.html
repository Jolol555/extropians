<p>I believe it's been done. But maybe you're thinking of this passage from
<br>
THE LAST MORTAL GENERATION:
<br>
<p>===========
<br>
<p>Menopause marks a change in a body's response to these pituitary messages,
<br>
largely because a woman's ovaries are finally depleted of eggs. Unlike men,
<br>
&nbsp;who keep producing spermatozoa all their lives, girls are born with a
<br>
limited supply. Once all the eggs are gone, the ovaries can no longer
<br>
respond to LH and FSH, even in elevated quantities - so other hormones
<br>
necessary for health, chemical messengers formerly made in those tissues,
<br>
simply dry up.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fact that ova are a finite resource is a reflection of the
<br>
evolutionary history of  human ageing. A human female foetus contains a
<br>
startling seven millions eggs, which are screened and shed in vast
<br>
profusion during the course of her mother's pregnancy. At birth, the number
<br>
of ova in the new-born girl child is down to a million, and the number
<br>
keeps dropping through life - a quarter of a million at puberty, only
<br>
25,000 by around age 40. When a mere thousand or so remain, the subtle
<br>
feedback between pituitary and ovaries starts to shut down. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that surgically removing and freezing some of this
<br>
wasted ovary tissue, transplanting it back in late middle age, might serve
<br>
to extend the hormonal protection granted to the reproductively able.
<br>
Indeed, experiments have shown that implanting ovary tissues from aborted
<br>
female foetuses (which contain, as mentioned, a huge supply of egg cells)
<br>
can extend an adult's sexual window. This is regarded by many as a
<br>
repugnant option, and has been banned in some countries, but the point
<br>
remains - it is the loss of eggs that activates the doleful cascade of
<br>
menopause, not the other way around.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once that happens, then, a menopausal woman's reproductive hormone system
<br>
starts to shut down, and the long-term consequences for the whole female
<br>
body are well-nigh catastrophic. As the least of her problems, fat is laid
<br>
down more readily in some places and less so in others, so an older woman's
<br>
body is likely to thicken and sag even as her features hollow and wrinkle.
<br>
Her bones grow brittle. And, for a time, `hot flushes' suffuse the whole
<br>
body as blood suddenly rushes into a woman's surface tissues, trying to
<br>
cool a body confused by the abrupt drop in levels of oestrogen. Luckily,
<br>
well-tailored Hormone Replacement Therapy can compensate for many of these
<br>
uncomfortable and injurious side-effects.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is menopause a selected, organised change in the human body's dynamic,
<br>
like the growth spurt and onset of sexual maturity in adolescence? Or is it
<br>
something more alarming - a simple failure of one life-support system after
<br>
another, driven by the loss of ova, the exhaustion of the ovaries, and the
<br>
consequent failure of all the reproductive machinery? Is the female human
<br>
body coded genetically to `degrade gracefully', as an engineer might put
<br>
it, or is post-menopause life just whatever happens after the final page of
<br>
the manual is turned and nothing more is written? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hormone replacement therapy already shows that we can stall some of these
<br>
uncomfortable and damaging changes, although sometimes at a price. [...]
