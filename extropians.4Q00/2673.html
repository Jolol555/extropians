Nicq MacDonald quoted,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;A day shall come when you shall see your high things no more, and your
</em><br>
low
<br>
<em>&gt; things all too near, and you will fear your exaltation as if it were a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phantom.  In that day you will cry: All is false!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Another version:
<br>
&quot;One day you will no longer see what is exalted in you, and what is base
<br>
in you, you will see all too closely; your sublimity itself will make you
<br>
afraid, as if it were a phantom. One day you will cry: 'Everything is
<br>
false.'&quot;
<br>
<p>The reason for calling everything an illusion is not philosophical, the
<br>
basic reason is psychological. Living alone in your head requires a
<br>
certain kind of strength so that you keep yourself sane. The self-imposed
<br>
solitary confinement of solipsism can cause one to hallucinate, to start
<br>
talking to those hallucinations, and finally to answer from their side.
<br>
To live in solitude and to remain sane requires that one be creative, so
<br>
one creates an illusory world and then calls it false.
<br>
<p>Zarathustra continues...
<br>
&quot;There are emotions that seek to kill the solitary; if they do not
<br>
succeed, well, they must die themselves! But are you capable of being a
<br>
murderer?&quot;
<br>
<p>Can you be a murderer of your own illusions, murderer of your own
<br>
emotions? In your solitude you will desire friends, lovers, family, and
<br>
all kinds of things of which you've not yet thought. These desires will
<br>
kill you; these emotions will kill you, unless you are able to kill them.
<br>
Hence Zarathustra asks &quot;are you capable of being a murderer of your own
<br>
emotions?&quot;
<br>
<p>Only choiceless awareness can directly experience reality.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
