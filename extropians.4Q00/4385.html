<em>&gt; |&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |&gt; Will the United States have more than 50 states?  There are procedures

</em><br>
<em>&gt; |&gt;

<em>&gt; |&gt; The flag does not have to change.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; |Traditionally it does, since the flag laws say that the stars represent

<em>&gt; |the number of states. I personally would bet on there being fewer states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |in the future (there are secessionist movements in Hawaii and Alaska).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about the last time some states tried to leave the federation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; South vs North, and all that. They did not succeed, AFAIK.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Feel free to elaborate on why secessionists would have more luck today.
</em><br>
<p>Primarily because there is no slavery issue for the remaining americans
<br>
to get indignant over, and at least in the case of Hawaii a good case
<br>
can be made that it was illegally annexed anyways, at least done by
<br>
bully tactics, similar reasons by which we snagged the Panama Canal
<br>
Zone, and which were later used in propaganda to justify returning the
<br>
canal to the Panamanians. Alaska was not one of the original colonies,
<br>
so there is less sentimental attachment, and the propaganda could be
<br>
that it &quot;only cost us $2 million bucks anyways, so its hardly worth much
<br>
to bother about&quot;.
<br>
Moreover, it was far more socially acceptable to order other peoples
<br>
kids to their deaths 140 years ago for abstract reasons than it is
<br>
today. While in the case of Alaska at least there would likely be a
<br>
fight due to the value of its strategic resources (oil), it's such a
<br>
large area that it would be impossible for an occupation force to take
<br>
and police with any degree of success. Its terrain lends itself well to
<br>
guerrilla insurgency forces.
