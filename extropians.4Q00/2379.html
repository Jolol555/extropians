Congress does more than just vote on bills.  They actually *write* the
<br>
bills.  This, I believe, would not be feasible for the nation as a whole to
<br>
do online, or offline for that matter.  I'm sure you've heard that two
<br>
things you don't want to see are (a) sausage being made and (b) laws being
<br>
written.  The laws that Congress writes are not simple things like &quot;it shall
<br>
be illegal to run a red light.&quot;  They are usually long, drawn-out, very
<br>
detailed pieces of legislation that would take hours to even read, much less
<br>
write.  The important pieces of legislation are most often the result of
<br>
excruciatingly negotiated compromises between many competing special
<br>
interests.
<br>
<p>Also, in order to create a statutory scheme is not self-contradictory, the
<br>
people writing the new laws need at least a workable understanding of the
<br>
existing laws.  I'm not saying Congress is efficient, or even the best way
<br>
to get legislation enacted.  But *I* can't imagine a way to do it in a truly
<br>
democratic manner where all 200 million of us each get to have our say.

<p><p><em>&gt; I just realized, if it gets to the point where we can vote online, then
</em><br>
what
<br>
<em>&gt; is to prevent the elimination of congress altogether, and simply have
</em><br>
people
<br>
<em>&gt; vote directly for each bill (besides the time it would take)? Or at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replace one of the arms of the legislature with them. Or this, or that..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.. there's a lot of ways to do it. At minimum, a public vote of 66%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be able to veto or override the president's veto of any bill.
