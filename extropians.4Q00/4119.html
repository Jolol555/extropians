<em>&gt; What went wrong with deregulation?  Why did the deregulated companies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not produce power cheaper than the regulated government monopoly? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because the deregulated industry was not really a free market.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state of California was a captive marketplace which had to purchase 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the power by law.  There was no customer feedback to reject prices 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when they got too high.
</em><br>
<p>This is true.  Only one of the three public utilities, San Diego Gas
<br>
and Electric, has been allowed to pass on price increases.  And when
<br>
they did, customers howled.  Prices went up by factors of two or three.
<br>
I think they ended up forcing rollbacks of customer prices.
<br>
<p>(I think it's kind of ironic: we've been told for years to save energy,
<br>
while all the while low prices have caused exactly the opposite behavior.
<br>
Now when we are finally given a real incentive to save, it's politically
<br>
unacceptable.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instead of high-priced companies losing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market-share, this deregulated environment ensured market-share to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all power producers no matter how high their prices got.  Naturally, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices kept going up and up with no end in sight.
</em><br>
<p>The way the system works, I can't really see how utility companies
<br>
can compete.  There's one set of lines, the same power producers are
<br>
used; the only difference is which company you send your payments to
<br>
and who pays the producers to arrange for electricity to be put onto
<br>
the wires.  The only real places competition can occur would seem to be
<br>
in administrative costs and possibly bargaining strength to get producer
<br>
prices down.  And the latter can't even happen now because of how the
<br>
electricity auction market works.
<br>
<p>The market is a &quot;first price&quot; auction, where suppliers and utility
<br>
companies offer and bid on electricity at a certain price per
<br>
megawatt-hour (MWh).  With this kind of auction, whatever the highest
<br>
price is for the last bit of electricity, that price is used for all
<br>
the electricity sold during that time period.  So if some providers are
<br>
selling for $100/MWh, but that only covers 80% of requirements, and then
<br>
others are selling enough for $150 to cover 10% more, and then some are
<br>
selling for $200 to cover the last 10%, everyone pays $200/MWh for all
<br>
the electricity.
<br>
<p>This kind of auction has some advantages in that it reduces &quot;gaming&quot; on
<br>
the part of the sellers, which is where they try to guess how much the
<br>
others are offering and adjust their offer prices correspondingly.  With a
<br>
first price auction there is more incentive to just offer an honest price,
<br>
because if someone else offers more then you can still get the benefit.
<br>
However it does reduce some of the bargaining possibilities, and the
<br>
latest proposals get rid of this feature at least for prices above some
<br>
cap of $250 or $500/MWh.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Basically, the new power companies did not try to work more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiently or produce cheaper power than the previous monopoly did. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since they are producing a costlier product, the customer is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; switching back to the cheaper brand.  The state is not shutting down 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the new companies.  It is merely putting them on notice that it will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no longer purchase high-priced power when it can produce its own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power cheaper.  Only power that is priced at what the state feels is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable will be purchased by that customer.
</em><br>
<p>During deregulation, the public utility companies (SDGE, PGE, SCE)
<br>
were forced to sell off their power plants.  These are now owned by a
<br>
variety of operators.  The utility companies buy power in the markets
<br>
and have to buy enough to service their customers.
<br>
<p>There is now competition (theoretically) in both areas: power generation,
<br>
and providing power to customers.  The second is somewhat theoretical,
<br>
as I mentioned; you can sign up for another power provider, such as
<br>
Green Mountain, but it's largely just a difference in accounting.
<br>
<p>The greater hope was for competition among power plant operators.
<br>
This seems to be what is breaking down.  At the time the California
<br>
system was implemented, Californians were paying $100/MWh, twice the
<br>
national rate.  After deregulation it went down for a while.  But starting
<br>
this past summer the price has gone unstable and has had some extremely
<br>
high peaks.  For the past two weeks it has been especially bad and has
<br>
reached over $1000/MWh some days.
<br>
<p>It's not known whether the power generators are colluding to keep the
<br>
price this high.  IMO there are enough competitors in the market that
<br>
collusion seems unlikely.  People say that operators are pulling plants
<br>
off line intentionally to cause shortages.  But for any given operator, he
<br>
can make a bundle if he can manage to get a few more generators operating
<br>
given these incredibly high rates.  It's hard for me to believe that
<br>
some hypothetical cartel has enough discipline to make its members hold
<br>
back when there is so much money to be made individually at the expense
<br>
of others.
<br>
<p>I suspect that the real explanation is simply a matter of supply and
<br>
demand.  As Harvey says, demand is largely inelastic and doesn't change
<br>
with price, since the prices aren't being passed through.  And supply has
<br>
been hampered due to delays in constructing new plants and environmental
<br>
regulations.  Any time you have a limited supply and inelastic demand,
<br>
you will get price spikes as demand approaches supply.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this instance, the state of California seems to be acting like any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other customer in a free-market environment.  They are limiting the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price they are willing to pay, and they are switching from costly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producers to more efficient producers.  Even when choosing between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regulated and deregulated industries, the free market chooses the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most efficient options.  Too bad the new companies deliberately chose 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profiteering over efficiency.
</em><br>
<p>Every company chooses that course which maximizes its profits.  Using
<br>
loaded words like profiteering is pointless.  We are all profiteers.
