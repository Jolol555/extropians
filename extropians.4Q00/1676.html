<p>
I think I'm responding to Nick Bostrom, following some discussion 
<br>
by Jason Thompson &amp; Hal Finney, but I'm not sure given the
<br>
forwarding this went through.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But finding a second source of intelligent life, in our relative vicinity, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would dramatically boost the support for those theories which say that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent life is common. (My PhD thesis at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com/phd">http://www.anthropic-principle.com/phd</a> has more on this and many other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;related topics.)
</em><br>
<p>I think you may need to refine the term &quot;intelligent life&quot; a bit.  A pretty
<br>
good case can be made that dolphins, whales, and even perhaps other
<br>
primates are as &quot;intelligent&quot; as we are.  What they lack is a system
<br>
for recording and transmitting knowledge across generations.  I think the
<br>
human ability to do this is what makes us interesting.  So, you want
<br>
to really focus on the development of intelligent &quot;technological&quot; life.
<br>
Of interest, might also be species, that are much less intelligent, but
<br>
do develop the ability to archive information, then retreive and  manipulate
<br>
it.  Hive minds of insects that developed external information storage 
<br>
technologies might be very interesting.  I believe there was
<br>
an example of this in Permutation City.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;For example, we can compare 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the time it actually took for intelligent life to evolve and compare that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the time that was available (an upper bound on which is given by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time when the sun engulfs the earth in about five billion years).
</em><br>
<p>Hsssss...  The sun engulfing the planet is a very poor limit unless
<br>
you are taking a very anthropic view of what &quot;life&quot; must look like.
<br>
The habitable water zones shrink as the stars get smaller (K &amp; M
<br>
class), but they are much more numerous and live much longer.  Free-formed
<br>
or wandering planets (flung out of solar systems by gravitational sling-shots)
<br>
could still evolve life based on energy from gravitational contraction
<br>
or radioactive decay if they formed in regions significantly enriched
<br>
by SN explosions with radioactive elements.  While the matter density
<br>
of gas clouds is low, we know they are seedded with the building
<br>
blocks of life, have energy sources in nearby stars and have very
<br>
large (&gt;&gt; solar) masses (which may offset their low density).
<br>
<p>Going back as far as Shklovsky and Sagan, there are concepts
<br>
of civilizations advanced only slightly beyond ours, to reengineer
<br>
their star to extend its longevity.  There are also concepts for moving
<br>
the planet.  So, any limits on the maximum longevity of technological
<br>
civilizations are very questionable.
<br>
<p>So, using the model that &quot;intelligent life&quot; must evolve (and continue
<br>
to live) on water based planets around G class stars with 10 billion
<br>
year longevities is *not* a good approach to the discussion, IMO.
<br>
I recognize that because it represents the only known &quot;existing&quot; example,
<br>
it makes some &quot;limited&quot; sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We can also look at our evolutionary record and try to identify plausible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;candidates for critical steps. For example, the step from prokaryotic to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eukaryotic life seems to have been very difficult.
</em><br>
<p>There were a number of messy problems that had to get solved in this
<br>
transition.  There are two that seem the most important.  The first
<br>
was the &quot;active transport&quot; of molecules to various locations in the cell
<br>
(the cellular postal system), which required the development of both the
<br>
transport motors and an addressing and delivery system.  This was
<br>
a consequence of needing to make the cells larger to accomodate larger
<br>
genomes (genome packing may have also had to be developed).  The
<br>
second was the isolation of the genome within the nucleus and the
<br>
complex machinery to handle duplicating &amp; separating the chromosomes,
<br>
breaking down and reassembling the nuclei, etc.  It isn't clear
<br>
exactly why this was done.  The best argument I can make is the
<br>
protection of the DNA from free radicals or xenotoxins in the
<br>
cytoplasm, but this seems like a weak reason to me.
<br>
<p>*However*, there is no reason to believe that &quot;intelligent technological
<br>
life&quot; requires eukaryotic architectures.  There may be other equally
<br>
good solutions to the problems that eukaryotic cells were trying
<br>
to solve that could have occured elsewhere but may have taken
<br>
less evolutionary time.  For example, there are bacteria, such
<br>
as Anabena, that do have sophisticated abilities to form cellular
<br>
aggregates with a division of labor between the cell types.
<br>
Is difficult to say how many different solutions might have
<br>
evolved here and died out due to changing climates, impacts
<br>
from space, etc.  It still remains a mystery what happened
<br>
to the range of species produced in the precambrian explosion.
<br>
Who is to say what experimental approaches to even simpler
<br>
forms of life were developed prior to that that we have no
<br>
record of?  On other planets, these could have taken faster
<br>
(or slower) approaches to the development of complex multi-cellular
<br>
forms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;..., except that all the evidence we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have is perfectly consistent with the hypothesis that it is extremely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difficult for intelligent life to evolve. This is also consistent with (and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in my opinion is the most probable explanation of) the absence of any signs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of extraterrestrial intelligence (the Fermi paradox).
</em><br>
<p>There is also a reasonable amount of evidence (IMO) to suggest that
<br>
there is no Fermi Paradox.  We are almost completely lacking in the
<br>
ability to detect &quot;life&quot; at a distance, especially life at the limits
<br>
of physical laws.  Minsky pointed out ~28 years ago that any &quot;life&quot;
<br>
that radiates energy at anything slightly above the background temperature
<br>
of the universe is being inherently wasteful.  He is correct, and our
<br>
abilities to detect fine-scale variations in radiation at those temperatures
<br>
is very poor.  So the only &quot;question&quot; that Fermi really raises is at what
<br>
point do intelligent civlizations choose to stop growing?  I believe
<br>
that transition is one that every civilization must face as it
<br>
decodes its genetic makeup and develops the engineering to
<br>
create individuals that live indefinately.  There comes a point
<br>
in time where &quot;intelligence&quot; (and philosophy?) must resolve
<br>
the points made by Malthus so long ago.  Just as you can
<br>
envision a buckytube bearing being a &quot;perfect&quot; bearing, there
<br>
should be &quot;optimal&quot; architectures for life &amp; civilizations
<br>
(depending on what they have consciously chosen to be and do).
<br>
<p>By definition, expanding colonization of the galaxy (or the
<br>
universe!) cannot be one of those optima, because sooner or later
<br>
it must come to an end.  Panspermia doesn't solve the problem of
<br>
&quot;how does life originate&quot;, it just moves it someplace else.
<br>
The &quot;Colonization Mentality&quot; (which leads to the Fermi Paradox)
<br>
doesn't solve the problem of, &quot;How do civilizations achieve a
<br>
balanced long term equilibria with their environment?&quot;
<br>
(it simply postpones the inevitability of that requirement).
<br>
I don't think there is a &quot;Fermi Paradox&quot; to really advanced
<br>
civilizations as they would have refined their civilization
<br>
to a point where it is in balance with its environment.
<br>
There are a lot more PhD thesis that need to be written about
<br>
the possible end-points for technological civilizations and how
<br>
we might recognize them.
