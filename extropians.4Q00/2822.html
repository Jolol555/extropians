<em>&gt; The Original Message was:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I suspect that experiencing a wide variety of conscious states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has added a certain amount of resilience to my personality.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are these different conscious states consistent with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one personality [one soul]? Or is this personality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; splitted in many othogonal states of mind?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scerir
</em><br>
<p>I meant this in a very prosaic, practical way.  IMHO, my singular
<br>
personality is more stable for having used psychedelics.  I am more calm.
<br>
I am more likely to respond to potentially alarming or confusing situations
<br>
in a calm and clear way.  I am more competent and more able to act
<br>
effectively in confusing situations, or in other altered states.
<br>
<p>There is a separate effect which your mention of &quot;orthogonal states of
<br>
mind&quot; prompts me to mention:  I believe psychedelics have helped me
<br>
integrate various aspects of my personality, specifically various parts of
<br>
my world-view which I previously felt were fairly separate.  One phenomena
<br>
frequently noted in the use of psychedelics is a tendency to see more
<br>
patterns and connections relating previously unrelated phenomena.
<br>
<p>In truth, this may be largely illusory.   The mind has a tendency to see
<br>
patterns which may not actually exist.  But, while the psychedelic mind
<br>
produces many false-positive patterns or connections, it also produces some
<br>
true-positives that were not apparent to the non-psychedelic mind.  (Or at
<br>
least this is my own experience.)
<br>
<p>I should also add that I agree with the poster who commented on other
<br>
techniques, meditation in particular, as viable routes to some of the same
<br>
effects.  I would also encourage anyone who wants a more predictable
<br>
psychedelic experience to experiment with the combination of psychedelic
<br>
substances and grounding techniques such as meditation and yoga.  I find
<br>
that they mix quite well, and indeed potentiate each other.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
