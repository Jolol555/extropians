<p>Of course it's an opinion: we can't study advanced cultures from close

as there aren't any. Nevertheless, logics dictates that ignoring the

hardware layer is perilous as long as you couple to physical reality.

<p>Yes, but then it stops being navel gazing.

<p><em> &gt; material/physical then some beings or even entire species may find the

<br>
Sure it is provincial, but a cat may look at a queen.
<br>
<p>I'm not judging on whether it is meaningful/worthwhile, or not (I'm
<br>
rather fond of navelgazing myself, orelse I wouldn't be here), but
<br>
realworld barbarians are rarely impressed with delicate works of
<br>
art. They will raze your diamond castles, and fashion trinkets from
<br>
your flesh &amp; bone.

<p><em> &gt; I think we have more freedom to rewrite who we are and what &quot;we&quot; means
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Uh, we don't know how to make new usable spacetime nor
<br>
matterenergy. I'm not saying it can't be done, just that we should
<br>
remain within the limits of known physics in our speculations. There
<br>
are a lot more of could-be's than there are what-really-is'ses.

<p><em> &gt; Socializing is actually pretty boring eventually as it becomes too

</em><br>
<p>In reality, the opposite is true. The higher cerebralisation, the more 
<br>
resources allocated to intangibles. We primates are particularly good
<br>
at it.
