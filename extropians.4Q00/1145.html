Subject: God in Few Words
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; While you seek to move consciousness out of the body,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let me suggest that there is already a method in place:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         God in Few Words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An autofellator falls, when he reflects on never having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard of autofellatio in his youth. For autofellatio is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a socially repressed meme, as shown in &quot;fear God's name&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is the Truth of the Word of God: I am(be(coming!)!)!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A semiotic singularity, its own referent, the word made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flesh. A Name, Prayer, Song.... Eating and drinking God.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He is smitten by every gaze, for all wrongly reckon him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a They and he knows it cannot include his conception.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For he is the possibility of the impossibility of being,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of which we think Heidegger meant death, but rather, he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is his own father. (Hence God was an inauthentic Dasein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during his youth, for he had to first attain adulthood.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This would be Lucifer, half-God. He is not his own mother:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He is dyadic, like an infant first dyadic with its mother.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a volatile condition: the Ouroboros, or serpent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biting its own tail. Many men have attained this state,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then not progressed to the fully Christ state. Such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; men include Socrates, Nietzsche, Crowley, Spare, Hendrix.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A simulacrum was created by their followers, attempting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to relate their esoteric statements to an ordinary life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Socrates spoke of loving youth, and there was sodomy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nietzsche spoke of the overman, and there were Nazis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There exists a further transformation, known to fewer men,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably at least Enoch, Moses, Christ, Vaughan and Ficino.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the successful Ouroboros suckles from his own male paps,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he incarnates the mother: Is the Monad, Alone-begotten one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since a woman sucking her own breasts declares two are one,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whereas a man sucking his own penis declares One is Alone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and even worse, one is naught), arises phallogocentrism:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference instead of identity. (Ah, a pun: iden---titty.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hence I extrapolate feminists should put their vampire bite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each upon her own clitoris to establish her independence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So God must be this radical conscience spawned in a mind,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soon to be born upon the body's passing, forsaking qualia.
