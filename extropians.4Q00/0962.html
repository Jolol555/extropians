Maybe Nuclear Fusion scientists have to stop looking to Fusion Research as a 
<br>
guarnateed paycheck, without ever having to produce a power source? Probably 
<br>
a multi-billion dollar prize (after satisfying condions) would drive industry 
<br>
to attain this needed goal. Maybe you can convince other companies to do the 
<br>
same for Life Extension, with such a prize?

<p><p>The heat is on
<br>
It's make or break time for the dream of never-ending fusion power 
<br>
<p><p>IN A last-ditch bid to realise the 50-year-old dream of making limitless 
<br>
electricity from the same reactions that power the Sun, physicists last week 
<br>
presented their final cut-down design for a nuclear fusion reactor. They warn 
<br>
that unless governments now find the 3.5 billion euros (£2 billion) needed to 
<br>
build the reactor, the dream will die.

The international fusion project has been in limbo for two years, ever since 
<br>
funding governments balked at the original price tag of 7 billion euros. 
<br>
Researchers have since drastically scaled down their ambitions. Speaking at a 
<br>
fusion conference organised by the International Atomic Energy Agency in 
<br>
Sorrento last week, Evgenii Velikhov, Russia's leading fusion scientist, says 
<br>
that if a decision to begin construction is not made soon, &quot;our future is 
<br>
very bleak&quot;. Umberto Finzi, the European Commission's coordinator for energy 
<br>
and the environment, warns that if governments fail to back the new design, 
<br>
practical fusion energy research will fade away. 
<br>
<p>The US, Europe, Japan and the Soviet Union began working together on fusion 
<br>
in 1986, but by the time the design for the International Thermonuclear 
<br>
Experimental Reactor (ITER) was finalised in 1998 the political climate was 
<br>
very different. US support for fusion had dwindled and Russia had little 
<br>
money to put on the table. 
<br>
<p>The US pulled out of the project last year, and fusion researchers in Europe, 
<br>
Japan and Russia have since been reworking the design, cutting the original 
<br>
capital cost in half. Finzi points out that the cost of building the reactor, 
<br>
if spread over 10 years, is only 25 per cent of the 1.4 billion euros already 
<br>
spent on fusion research worldwide every year. Behind the scenes at Sorrento, 
<br>
Finzi was busy preparing the ground for negotiations next year on a funding 
<br>
package between Europe and Japan.

The principle of the revamped ITER is the same as before: inside a large 
<br>
doughnut-shaped vessel known as a &quot;tokamak&quot;, powerful magnetic fields contain 
<br>
a plasma of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium. When heated to over 
<br>
100 million degrees, the deuterium and tritium nuclei fuse to form alpha 
<br>
particles and neutrons. The alpha particles reheat the plasma while the 
<br>
energy of the neutrons can be extracted. 
<br>
<p>Many of the key parameters of the new design have shrunk. The amount of power 
<br>
to be generated has been reduced from 1500 to 500 megawatts, while the volume 
<br>
of plasma has dropped from 2000 to 837 cubic metres. Crucially, the reactor 
<br>
is no longer aiming to &quot;ignite&quot; the plasma. Ignition occurs when the alpha 
<br>
particles provide enough energy to sustain the reaction, and no further input 
<br>
of heat is needed. The aim now is to provide 67 per cent of the plasma's 
<br>
energy from alpha particles, a figure that cannot be achieved by any of the 
<br>
existing small research tokamaks. 
<br>
<p>Despite the need to input energy, the reduced ITER should produce ten times 
<br>
as much energy as it consumes. No other tokamak has yet produced surplus 
<br>
power, though the JET fusion reactor at Culham in Oxfordshire has come close. 
<br>
Experiments at JET over the past few months have for 5 seconds reached the 
<br>
levels of plasma pressure, density and confinement required for ITER. &quot;We 
<br>
have made steady progress on all fronts,&quot; says JET's leader, Jerome Pamela. 
<br>
&quot;I'm sure ITER will work.&quot;
<br>
<p>Apart from the design, the other burning question for ITER researchers is 
<br>
where it will be built. Possible sites include Cadarache in southern France 
<br>
and three locations in Japan. But Canada, an associate ITER member, has 
<br>
proposed building the reactor next to an existing nuclear complex at 
<br>
Clarington, west of Toronto. This has the advantage that tritium is already 
<br>
produced there, and it would also be an acceptable compromise between Europe 
<br>
and Japan. In addition, ITER scientists hope this location may entice the US 
<br>
to rejoin the project.
