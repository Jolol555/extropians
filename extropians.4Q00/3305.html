</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; A backup would just be a copy- your consciousness would be gone forever.

<em>&gt; I'm not interested in &quot;backing myself up&quot;, having my brain scanned into a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stardust didn't organize itself into a human being overnight, no matter what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any scripture might say.
</em><br>
<p>What is your consciousness?  When you are knocked out, where is your
<br>
consciousness?  If you had every part of your brain bit by bit replaced
<br>
by more efficient hardware performing the same functions but better,
<br>
would you still be you?  If so then why would copying all that is part
<br>
of your consciousness and reintroducing it into a reconstructed body be
<br>
not-you?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So as long as accidents are possible you are saying that not dying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; except by such unforeseen and unprepared for accident is simply not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; good thing?  Or not good enough for you to be particularly interested?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No.  Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against life extension.  I just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't believe in immortalism- and many of the immortalist scenarios I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read offer little appeal to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I hear what you are saying but I have yet to understand why they don't
<br>
appeal to you. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Maybe so, but so what?  Would you rather stay on this size of stage you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are on now for these few short years followed by oblivion or expand the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stage and the time, perhaps enough to find real answers to whatever it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is you seek?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly- I plan to make use of any technology that comes along that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially extend my lifespan without destroying my true self.  I'll make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use of any nanotech devices or longevity treatments that come along, barring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the destruction of my body or brain.  I'm not going to download myself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however- I like having a body, and, until the tech is availiable for me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmute myself into other forms, I'll keep it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do you think you know what your true self is?  If not then what is it
<br>
that will inform you what will endanger it?  Your body is being
<br>
destroyed and recreated throughout your life.  It is a dynamic system. 
<br>
I like having a body to.  If possible I want one that is not so puny and
<br>
prone to various breakdowns and extreme limitations as this one.  I
<br>
would also like a brain much more capable than the one I was dealt at
<br>
birth.  I don't consider this particular flesh (including this
<br>
particular brain) to be definitive of &quot;I&quot; even as it is what &quot;I&quot; am
<br>
embodied within and implemented through at this time.  
<br>
<p>When you transmute into other forms how is this so very different than
<br>
transference to another form?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Does this somehow comfort you or are you somehow confronting us with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something you think is for our own good or what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No- it's just the truth.  In the long run, we're dead.  It doesn't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comfort me- how could the idea of dissolution possibly comfort an egomaniac?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just don't see any point in a lifespan extended beyond a few millenia...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but this is subject to change.  I don't have to worry about this until 4000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CE.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If you don't see any point in it it is because there is no point except
<br>
the point of existence which each of us must create for verself.  The
<br>
creation of the point is essential continuously.  It cannot be put off
<br>
for a few thousand years.
