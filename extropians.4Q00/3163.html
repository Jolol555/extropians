Michael M. Butler, &lt;<a href="mailto:butler@comp-lib.org?Subject=Re:%20Civilization%20and%20Enemies,%20was%20Re:%20CONFESSIONS%20OF%20A%20CHEERFUL%20LIBERTARIAN%20By%20David%20Brin&In-Reply-To=&lt;200012012236.OAA20265@finney.org&gt;">butler@comp-lib.org</a>&gt;, writes:

<em>&gt; Not to fan any acrimony flames, but given that information wants to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free, how do you plan to achieve privacy in 2005? In 2010? In 2020?
</em><br>
<p>A fair question.  I believe technologies are coming which will allow us to
<br>
maintain considerable amounts of privacy even in an increasingly networked
<br>
world.  Freenet, for example, is designed to be a publishing medium
<br>
where authors and readers can share data anonymously.  This is exactly
<br>
the kind of system which David Brin describes as a threat, providing a
<br>
&quot;blinding fog&quot; (his words) to hide the data which is being shared.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The evolution of cooperation stuff indicates that rough parity among all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; players is essential for cooperation to be a good strategy. Pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individualism in its rawest form is hard to distinguish from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pyschopathology unless the observer has confidence in the shared values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the observed. Think Mickey and Mallory in _Natural Born Killers_.
</em><br>
<p>Ultimately we are all individuals and people's greatest motivations are to
<br>
benefit themselves.  Yet that motivational framework has led to trade and
<br>
exchange and the fantastically interwoven global economy we have today,
<br>
even in the face of individual differences in power and wealth.
<br>
<p>Individualism is not the same as hatred of society, but rather, it is
<br>
a philosophical position which puts the individual first.  Society is
<br>
judged on the basis of the benefits it provides to individuals, rather
<br>
than vice versa.  &quot;Ask not what you can do for your country, but what
<br>
your country can do for you.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The mantra you mention is far from valueless to me. Please don't make me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your enemy just yet. 
</em><br>
<p>The problem with &quot;I am a member of a civilization&quot; is that it doesn't say
<br>
whether the civilization is good or bad.  Just to get the Hitler reference
<br>
out of the way, if the Third Reich had won some of us might have been
<br>
members of that civilization.  Would that make it good?  Would that
<br>
mean we should support it?  No, a civilization must be judged on the
<br>
basis of its values and its works.  Whether I am or am not a member of
<br>
any particular civilization tells me nothing about whether it is worth
<br>
my support.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Principles *are* important. One principle that's important is not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burn the barn down while the horse is still inside.
</em><br>
<p>I don't follow what that means in this context.
<br>
<p>Hal
