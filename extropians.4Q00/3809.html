<p>That's why I have difficulty in believing they are &quot;one&quot; thing.  They 
<br>
seem seperate and not connected in any way.  They just are following 
<br>
the same design and therefore act similarly.

<p><em>&gt;I had typed up several lengthy paragraphs expounding upon why I

<p>A strawman is when you misrepresent the other's position and then 
<br>
attack it.  Representing my own unpopular opinion is not a strawman.

<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To you, the importance of your continued existence is only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adequately represented by the program looking at the world through

</em><br>
<p>Mostly right, except that the physical eyes can be replaced with 
<br>
other physical eyes within the same original.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Trying to pretend that those core values can somehow be melded or 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That's what I've been saying for a long time.  We neither disagree in 
<br>
science or specifics.  We disagree in goals and motives.
