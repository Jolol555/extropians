<p>'Ignorance' of Greens berated by scientist
<br>
By Roger Highfield, Science Editor
<br>
<p>AN independent scientist revered by Green groups attacks them today for their 
<br>
stance on nuclear power and GM food.
<br>
<p>James Lovelock, 81, who is best known for his Gaia theory and the many 
<br>
environmental prizes he has won, said: &quot;Too many Greens are not just ignorant 
<br>
of science, they hate science.&quot;
<br>
<p>Named after the Greek goddess of Earth by the novelist William Golding, Gaia 
<br>
theory says that creatures, rocks, air and water interact in subtle ways to 
<br>
ensure the environment remains stable. Gaia has exerted great influence on 
<br>
the Green movement, but in Homage to Gaia: The Life of an Independent 
<br>
Scientist, published today, Lovelock says that he has &quot;never been wholly on 
<br>
the side of environmentalism&quot;. 
<br>
<p>He likens Greens to &quot;some global over-anxious mother figure who is so 
<br>
concerned about small risks that she ignores the real dangers&quot;. He wished 
<br>
they &quot;would grow up&quot; and focus on the real problem: &quot;How can we feed, house 
<br>
and clothe the abundant human race without destroying the habitats of other 
<br>
creatures?&quot;
<br>
<p>Unlike most Greens, Lovelock backs nuclear energy. &quot;Some time in the next 
<br>
century, when the adverse effects of climate change begin to bite, people 
<br>
will look back in anger at those who now so foolishly continue to pollute by 
<br>
burning fossil fuel instead of accepting the beneficence of nuclear power.
<br>
<p>&quot;Is our distrust of nuclear power and genetically modified food soundly 
<br>
based?&quot; he asks, saying that his disenchantment with the Green movement is 
<br>
similar to that of Patrick Moore, the veteran environmentalist who accused it 
<br>
of abandoning science. &quot;He was a founder of Greenpeace, but like me has an 
<br>
Orwellian view of the environmental lobbies as they are today.&quot;
<br>
<p>One reason why Lovelock regards the Green movement &quot;with mixed vexation and 
<br>
affection&quot; is its obsession with the chemical industry. &quot;To many Greens, if a 
<br>
chemical like methyl iodide or carbon disulphide comes from some dark satanic 
<br>
mill, it is by nature evil, but if it comes from organically grown or natural 
<br>
seaweed, it must be good and healthy. To me, as a scientist, it does not 
<br>
matter where it comes from. I am poisoned if I eat too much of it.&quot;
