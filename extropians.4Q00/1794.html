<p><em>&gt;There have been a bunch of physics articles about time machines over the

<p>Yes, but the proposed time travel models do not allow the past to be
<br>
*changed*.  If a future event causally affects a past event, that past
<br>
event was always altered.  It's similar to a micro-time-travel
<br>
model that  Hawking used for predictions on black hole radiation .
<br>
The current models agreed that changing the past creates paradox,
<br>
and demonstrated that in certain limited worlds you could have time
<br>
travel that didn't change the past.
