<p>A lot depends on what you call &quot;work&quot;.  If I only cared about software
<br>
enough to put in 35 hours a week I wouldn't care very software.  If your
<br>
work is what you are really interested in then you don't count the
<br>
number of hours this way.  If it isn't then make it so for the sake of
<br>
your sanity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hunter gatherers apparently spent about 2 hours a day in work-like (staying
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Obviously you have never spent any real time attempting to live off the
<br>
land. Even with modern weapons and tools for hunting the above is way
<br>
shy of reality.  And check out how long it would take you to clean and
<br>
dress a kill, properly build a fire in the wild and properly cook it
<br>
(you don't want to play with the bugs you could get otherwise) and how
<br>
long to dispose of the rest either for later or in such a way not to
<br>
have other predators checking out your tender flesh. It is a little
<br>
better fishing.  If you have gear or know how to make it and are
<br>
fortunate enough to be close to a place to fish. Don't wrestle any
<br>
grizzlies for the local salmon or trout though.  The time to gather wild
<br>
food, except in a few extremely liberal climes, of sufficient variety
<br>
and prepare it is even worse.  And we didn't talk about the time to find
<br>
pottable water, lug it about, maybe do various things to clean it up a
<br>
bit and so on.  Nor about the time to find a way to keep yourself clean
<br>
or to find and maintain shelter.
