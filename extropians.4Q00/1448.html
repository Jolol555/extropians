<em>&gt; &gt;I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; certain that you can use that money better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I certainly don't belong to the NRA just because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the magazine
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see what you mean.  If I lived in the US I would also be a member of 
<br>
the NRA, and I wouldn't care if they sent me a bi-monthly magazine or not.  
<br>
Since I don't live in the US, I can see no point whatsoever in being a 
<br>
member of the NRA, however.  I will not influence the situation in this 
<br>
country by being a member in an organisation like the NRA in a foreign 
<br>
country on the other side of the earth.  It would be a complete waste of 
<br>
money.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now, if you are the sort of shallow person who only thinks in terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of immediate material benefit, I suppose ExI may not be for you, either in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of its membership benefits or in its overall long term goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK.  Fair enough.  I can live with that.  I just wish that it had said 
<br>
so on the Extropy site early last year, when I joined.  Membership in the 
<br>
ExI is some sort of holy crusade, is it?  Think not of such petty things as 
<br>
money or personal gain, for there is something higher and more noble to be 
<br>
had from joining our holy mission.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may be right for all I know.  After all, I joined the ExI primarily 
<br>
because I agree with just about everything it stands for.  Unfortunately, I 
<br>
doubt that the ExI will make much of a difference over here in the 
<br>
foreseeable future, and I am very poor.  Hence, I will be shallow and 
<br>
materialistic enough to draw the conclusion that if the satisfaction of 
<br>
knowing that I support the forces of good is really all that you get out of 
<br>
an ExI membership, it is not for me.  If I were rich I might consider it, 
<br>
but as it is, yes, I do like to get a least something back for my money.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian
