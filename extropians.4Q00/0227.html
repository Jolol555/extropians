In your typical platoon during WWII, in any given firefight, typically 3-5
<br>
soldiers actually would shoot back, the rest trying to dig themselves as deep
<br>
into the ground as possible. Most people have an innate reluctance to shoot a
<br>
human shaped object. Durinig Vietnam, the Marines instituted a training program
<br>
that acknowledged this fact, and which attempted to break down this reluctance,
<br>
training soldiers to shoot BEFORE they had time to think about what they were
<br>
shooting at, that it was human shaped. Part of this comes from the psychological
<br>
trauma the drill instructors would put the trainees under every day, such that a
<br>
soldier in combat would fear their seargent more than the enemy, at least until
<br>
they had been through their first few firefights. The first few firefights would
<br>
typically weed out the soldiers. You would typically have three types: a) those
<br>
who either stood their ground and shot back or advanced and shot back, b) those
<br>
who would duck into the lowest hold they could find, and c) those who turned
<br>
tail and ran. Those in the third category would typically get shot in the back
<br>
by the enemy as they fled (this is typically the number one way to get killed on
<br>
the battlefield). Those in the second category would typically either survive
<br>
long enough to get rotated to a non-combat position, or find something to do
<br>
supporting someone who was willing to shoot back (feeding ammo and mortars,
<br>
giving first aid to other deadweights who got hit first, etc.), or get killed or
<br>
captured when the few who were shooting were overwhelmed by enemy forces. Those
<br>
in the first category typically survived and/or got the medals (sometimes
<br>
posthumously). Getting medals is not a matter of being brave in combat, but in
<br>
being brave in combat while an officer is looking (and who survives long enough
<br>
to report it).
<br>
<p>Special forces owe a large portion of their success to the fact that they are
<br>
100% proven shooters, so a small squad or maniple of specwarriors can do as much
<br>
damage as a platoon or company simply because they have as many actual shooters
<br>
as a conventional platoon or company (and they are more mobile because they
<br>
don't have to worry about carrying out cowardly deadweight). Since the early
<br>
Vietnam war era, the percent of soldiers actually shooting back in combat has
<br>
grown measurably, up to around 30-60% these days in conventional units. ASVAB
<br>
tests and other tests in early in training help the services weed out most
<br>
non-shooters into non-combat positions before they get sent off to train for
<br>
their MOS.
<br>
<p>The sort of training the Marines use to make shooting people instinctive is one
<br>
reason why combat soldiers are useless as police or 'peacekeeping' forces, and
<br>
why military police are separate from and different from other military units.
<br>
They have to be trained to be able to distinguish combatants from non-combatants
<br>
to a far more discriminating degree (the sort of training you see in 'hogan's
<br>
alley' type exercises).
