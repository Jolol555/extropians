Americans uneasy about `designer' kids
<br>
<p>NEW YORK: The prospect of expectant parents being able to choose between
<br>
fertilized eggs to have a baby who is intelligent, good-looking and talented
<br>
leaves most of the US public feeling uncomfortable, results of a new Harris
<br>
Poll show.
<br>
<p>A poll of 1,015 Americans reveals that although most feel it is okay for
<br>
parents to choose to have a child who can ``give cells&quot; to a sick sibling,
<br>
they largely oppose allowing parents to choose to have an attractive or
<br>
gifted child. Most also feel parents should not choose whether to have a boy
<br>
or girl.
<br>
<p>The survey was conducted in October, in the wake of a controversial case in
<br>
which a couple had a baby through in vitro fertilization in order to create
<br>
a stem-cell donor for their dying daughter. The parents chose the embryo
<br>
that eventually became their son because genetic tests showed it was free
<br>
from disease.
<br>
<p>The survey showed that 67% of respondents feel embryo selection is all right
<br>
in such a case. However, 72% said parents should not be able to ``choose to
<br>
have a child who is good-looking&quot;, and two-thirds were against picking a
<br>
&quot;gifted&quot; child. Sixty-four percent opposed choosing the sex of a child.
<br>
Respondents were split on whether it is acceptable to pick an embryo free of
<br>
genetic disease--48% were for it, while 44% opposed it.
<br>
<p>Overall, men gave more support than women did to parents' ability to choose
<br>
embryos. (Reuters)
