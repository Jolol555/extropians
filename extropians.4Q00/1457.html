<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why don't you tell us how you really feel, Ian - don't hold back!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I never heard from you, Ian.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was from April to October last year.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To the extent that your criticisms have merit, I'll address them, although
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your tone certainly doesn't encourage constructive feedback.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excuse me?  Getting any response at all from the ExI has been like 
<br>
pulling teeth.  I think you can appreciate that this has made me a little 
<br>
peeved.  That said, I am not out to insult anybody.  As I wrote, Max More 
<br>
seems like a very nice fellow.  It was he who finally took pity on me and 
<br>
answered my emails, and eventually, several months later, after a couple of 
<br>
reminders, confirmed that I was a member.  You may all be very nice people, 
<br>
but that is not the point.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I was misinformed concerning the ExI.  If I understand 
<br>
the other postings correctly, I should have realized that sending money to 
<br>
the ExI is just like sending money to CARE or to the Red Cross.  The 
<br>
difference is that by sending money to the ExI one gets the satisfaction of 
<br>
knowing that one supports &quot;the revolution.&quot;  I have to admit that I never 
<br>
realized this.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to believe that a membership in for instance the NSS and 
<br>
the Artemis Society also helps support something good and worthwhile.  Apart 
<br>
from the warm and fuzzy feeling this knowledge imparts, the benefits of a 
<br>
membership in these organizations also include magazines and access to 
<br>
members-only mailing lists (no coffee mugs or T-shirts).  Occasionally, they 
<br>
also send you interesting news via email.  Best of all, however, they do all 
<br>
this without you having to send them email messages until you are blue in 
<br>
the face, begging them to do it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I made the mistake of believing that you might actually get 
<br>
something for the money sent to the ExI, there may be others out there who 
<br>
are almost as stupid as I am, and who may therefore make the same mistake.  
<br>
I think it would be a good thing to help them from making this mistake.  The 
<br>
best thing would probably be if it said at your site that sending money to 
<br>
the ExI is just like sending it to CARE or the Red Cross, but that by doing 
<br>
so one helps fund &quot;the revolution.&quot;  Such a message would certainly 
<br>
discourage even somebody as stupid as me from joining.  It would be a whole 
<br>
lot more effective than my postings to this list are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Finally, let me ask whether you ever asked what you could do to improve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;value of our community?  Do you have skills that could add value?  Did you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;propose a project that would improve the future?  Many of our members have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is very nice, and I wish them all luck.  No, I never made any such 
<br>
suggestions.  Is that a requirement?  I had hoped to learn more about the 
<br>
ExI through whatever information the ExI would see fit to send me.  Perhaps 
<br>
I would then have made such suggestions eventually.  That is moot, however.  
<br>
I never received anything from the ExI whatsover -- nothing to discourage me 
<br>
from doing so, that is true, but nothing to spark my interest in proposing 
<br>
any projects either.  It is hard to feel any community spirit with an 
<br>
organization that doesn't seem to care about its members, and which doesn't 
<br>
communicate with you, in fact doesn't even reply to your messages.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say that I don't possess any skills whatsoever which could add 
<br>
value.  Does that mean that I am not welcome as a member?  In that case it 
<br>
would probably be a good idea to write that at the Extropy site as well.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian
