<p>Coaxing Molecular Devices to Build Themselves
<br>
<p>Dennis Normile
<br>
<p>NAGOYA--When Nagoya University chemist Makoto Fujita thinks about how
<br>
to store data in tiny spaces, he thinks big--about how nature handles
<br>
the problem. Then he tries to emulate the answer. &quot;A living cell is
<br>
incomparably smaller than a compact disc, but its DNA carries far more
<br>
information,&quot; he says. &quot;Handling data at the DNA's molecular scale
<br>
could lead to handheld supercomputers. But to do that we need more
<br>
efficient ways to manipulate molecules.&quot;
<br>
<p>Fujita and others are doing exactly that through a technique called
<br>
directed self-assembly. By adroitly exploiting the chemical and
<br>
electrical bonds that hold natural molecules together, they can get
<br>
molecules to form desired nanometer-scale structures. This could lead
<br>
to computer logic and memory devices up to 100 times smaller than
<br>
their current counterparts. Self-assembled molecules might also serve
<br>
as cages to hold and deliver unstable medical compounds, and as
<br>
crucibles for chemical reactions.
<br>
<p>The technique builds upon two properties of matter. One is the bonding
<br>
between hydrogen atoms, which holds the two strands of DNA in its
<br>
double helix. The other is the electrical attraction between
<br>
positively charged organic ions and negatively charged metal ions. The
<br>
organic ions are strategically placed on organic molecules, or
<br>
ligands, which are like the rods of Tinkertoy sets. The metal ions are
<br>
like the socketed disks that hold the rods together. Unlike
<br>
Tinkertoys, however, these metal ions and ligands assemble themselves
<br>
if mixed together in solution in the right proportions and under the
<br>
right thermodynamic conditions.
<br>
<p>Fujita was among those who pioneered the metal-ion technique in the
<br>
early 1990s. His first construction used four simple linear ligands
<br>
and four metal ions to produce square macromolecules. More recently,
<br>
his group has built an eight-sided, three-dimensional structure made
<br>
up of two pyramids joined at their bases.  The molecule is 3
<br>
nanometers across, and the cavity is big enough to hold a C60
<br>
molecule, the so-called buckyball. Fujita and other researchers have
<br>
also created a variety of grids, tubes, cages, and catenanes, which
<br>
are rings interlocked like links of a chain. &quot;Such structures cannot
<br>
be synthesized by conventional chemical reactions, but we can very
<br>
easily construct them using directed self-assembly,&quot; Fujita says.
<br>
<p>J. P. Sauvage, a chemist at Louis Pasteur University in Strasbourg,
<br>
France, has proposed using catenanes as computing devices. One ring
<br>
would be mechanically fixed, allowing the second ring to rotate. If
<br>
the second ring has an additional ion, it could be rotated 180 degrees
<br>
back and forth in response to an adjacent electrical charge. The
<br>
position of the ring would indicate the 1 and 0 of digital data.
<br>
<p>The molecular cages can be constructed to have small openings through
<br>
which atoms can enter and react with other atoms, forming molecules
<br>
that are too big to escape. This arrangement, which can capture and
<br>
stabilize molecules that otherwise rapidly react and disappear if free
<br>
in solution, could be the basis for a drug-delivery system.
<br>
<p>Donald Cram, a Nobel laureate in chemistry who is now retired from the
<br>
University of California, Los Angeles, used such a cage to capture
<br>
cyclobutadiene, a compound that briefly appears at intermediate stages
<br>
of some chemical reactions but which until then had been too unstable
<br>
for chemists to isolate. Julius Rebek, director of the Skaggs
<br>
Institute for Chemical Biology of the Scripps Research Institute in La
<br>
Jolla, California, who works on self-assembly using hydrogen atoms,
<br>
explains that the characteristics of cyclobutadiene had been
<br>
theoretically predicted but never confirmed. &quot;By encapsulating the
<br>
molecule, [Cram kept it] stable long enough to be characterized by
<br>
nuclear magnetic resonance,&quot; he says. Aside from its value to basic
<br>
research, this trick could be used to deliver drugs that are hard to
<br>
stabilize.
<br>
<p>Fujita predicts that the number of self-assembled molecules and their
<br>
uses will rise rapidly in the years to come. Whereas a decade ago
<br>
there were only a handful of groups working on self-assembly using
<br>
metal ions, he says, &quot;now there are dozens. The field is advancing
<br>
very rapidly.&quot;
