<em>&gt; You're

<em>&gt; I think while one is alive, one can always recover lost liberty and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence.  One can live to fight another day.
</em><br>
<p>No, you can't. There has been only one successful slave revolt in history:
<br>
Haiti, and look what happened there. Mass slavery causes a mass psychology
<br>
version of the Stockholm Syndrome, inculcating a subconcious slave master within
<br>
the mind of every slave, which they tend to pass down, to a greater or lesser
<br>
degree, to their children and later generations. It is not an accident that
<br>
those minorities who have suffered the most opression also exhibit
<br>
contemporarily the most distain for individual rights versus those (imaginary
<br>
ones) of the community.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That said, though, the willingness to fight to the death to keep them has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its merits.  It raises the price of dictatorship.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, would be dictators value their own hides far more than anyone elses. I
<br>
would put forward the proposition that 90%+ of those killed in military violence
<br>
over the last 20 years could have been avoided with the help of a few good
<br>
asassins. I can think of a handful to a dozen people off the top of my head
<br>
whose early deaths would have saved hundreds of thousands, if not a million or
<br>
two lives in this period. Asassination is highly underrated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Frankly, though, I'd rather get those who want to take them from me to die
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying than to make some romantic gesture a la the Light Brigade,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memorialized by Tennyson.  (Of course, I'm not claiming the Crimean War was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about liberty and intelligence.)  Dead is dead.  I'm sure Michael would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose that path too, though I'm not sure if either of us would be willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to go further.  After all, talk is talk.
</em><br>
<p>Depends. I would, of course, given the choice, choose martial action which
<br>
presented the least risk to my person. I prefer sniper work, for example, versus
<br>
trench combat. I do, however, have a record of putting risk out of my mind in
<br>
order to help save others, both in and out of the military. Romantic gestures of
<br>
suicidal missions I would prefer to avoid, however, given the choice only of
<br>
dying for no reason, or dying gloriously, well, as Heinlein said, your rank in
<br>
hell is determined by the size of your honor guard (i.e. how many of the bastids
<br>
you take with you). Being shot in the back while running like a bunny, or in a
<br>
firing line of prisoners, is not how I want to die or be remembered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That most people value just breathing alone more than liberty or any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing in life is just a fact.  This is why when most people are faced with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an armed robber or rapist, they give in rather than resist and die.
</em><br>
<p>Despite the proven fact (at least here in the US) that you are more likely to
<br>
die by not resisting. The meme of self preservation gets reinforced by
<br>
propaganda of individual disempowerment. Few slaves ever die in combat.
