<p>Yes, I know.  I thought about putting in a comment about that, maybe even
<br>
claiming that it made it &quot;harder to tell&quot;, but that would have been a dead
<br>
giveaway that I knew you were born on January 19th, 1982.  It's much more
<br>
eerie if I appear to &quot;guess&quot; you're a Capricorn.  Right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not that I put much stock in

<em>&gt; &gt; Huh.  I didn't even notice that.  Well, despite the sig, your favorite

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My favorite Crowley book is his collection of letters, &quot;Magick Without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tears&quot;, which the essay &quot;On Original Sin&quot; is in.
</em><br>
<p>Damn, blew it again.  Oh, well... more books you like include &quot;Hermetic
<br>
Magic&quot;, &quot;The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying&quot;, Dostoevsky's &quot;Crime and
<br>
Punishment&quot;, and &quot;Foundations of High Magick&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've actually never read a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decent copy of MiTaP, and yes, I am a fan of Peter J. Carroll, even if his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretations of quantum physics make Fritjof Capra look hard-nosed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparison.  Now tell me, who do you have planted in #thee_vortex, feeding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you info?
</em><br>
<p>I currently don't have anyone feeding me information.  Everything you've
<br>
seen so far, I did on my own.  I considered trying to contact a roommate
<br>
at St. Thomas to find out the name of your cat, but that would be too much
<br>
trouble.  I do need to draw the line somewhere.
<br>
<p>*You* have to stop feeding *me* additional information, though, or this
<br>
all gets much less impressive - what do you think this is, a palm
<br>
reading?  Saying that you chat on #thee_vortex really takes the impact out
<br>
of my calling you &quot;an eighteen-year-old chaos mage&quot;, which, by the way, I
<br>
knew beforehand, but too late now.  Likewise with the &quot;on the cusp&quot; line,
<br>
which blew the January 19th bit, forcing me to use the actual
<br>
date-of-birth for verification.  I was saving it for later.  Sigh...
