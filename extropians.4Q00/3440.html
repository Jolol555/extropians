</em><br>
<p>How is this an appropriate analogy.  Sure, twins are (theoretically) 
<br>
identical when they're both single cells, but once they start to 
<br>
develop and even before their little neurons start firing, they're 
<br>
very different entities.  The discussion was about having an *exact* 
<br>
duplicate standing by, ready to be restored from some backup of your 
<br>
thoughts and memories.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; There is a subjective sentimentality issue with which I can
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's not &quot;sentimentality&quot;, it's a truth of perspective.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;truth&quot; and &quot;perspective&quot; have so many meanings.  I'm sure I could 
<br>
pick some that I liked just to make a point, but I'd rather know more 
<br>
about why you used them.  Could you elaborate on the distinction 
<br>
you're trying to draw above?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; Instead, I've seen only the use of equivocation for words like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &quot;consciousness&quot; and &quot;continuity&quot; in some hopeless effort at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  maintaining a logical argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's the semantics that blow the argument apart-
</em><br>
<p>Which argument?  Yours or mine?  Could you give any examples?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  I'd suggest trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remember your own existence from time to time.
</em><br>
<p>I do and I feel strongly about maintaining its continuity.  In what 
<br>
way am I forgetting my existence?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If I had a better vocabulary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and more experience in logic, I could argue this point better.
</em><br>
<p>Well, please continue to try.  I feel fairly comfortable with the 
<br>
soundness of the conclusions that I've reached so far, but if you 
<br>
come up with a real distinction between you and a just-restored 
<br>
backup, I'd be interested in learning about it.  The quote in my sig 
<br>
is there because I think that it's good policy and I try to live it.
<br>
<p>Regards,
