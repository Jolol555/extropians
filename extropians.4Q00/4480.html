<p>
Using GPS, tell me where I am and how to get wherever I want to go
<br>
Using GPS, tell me where my child is (or wife or consenting members of a
<br>
&quot;buddy&quot; list)
<br>
Free voice over IP telephone calls
<br>
Hold a table at a restaurant - I *hate* waiting in lines when we go out to
<br>
eat - my 4 year old gets really bored.  It'd be nice to be able to &quot;get in
<br>
line&quot; while you're on the way to Macaroni Grill or whatever.  I can even see
<br>
a service popping up with restaurants having a slow night advertise on your
<br>
PDA (through your intelligent agent which knows where you are - see above)
<br>
letting you know where the shortest waits are.
<br>
Let me know where the &quot;happeningest&quot; nightclubs are - maybe even with a live
<br>
video to let me watch the action
<br>
Let me browse user reviews of some item I'm about to buy (impulse book
<br>
purchase at Border's)
<br>
Let me watch whatever shows I've Tivo'd.  This'd be handy while waiting in
<br>
line just about anywhere - airports, etc
<br>
Get live traffic reports given by actual drivers (or their computers) who
<br>
are where you'll be in 15 minutes
<br>
Reserve a parking space at the mall
<br>
<p>I could probably think of more.  I want to see what everyone else on the
<br>
list would like to see.  I tried to make my list a list of things that might
<br>
actually be possible in 2 or 3 years - unlike my desire to video record
<br>
everything I see and do all day or neato cool tricorder functions that we
<br>
won't have for a while.
