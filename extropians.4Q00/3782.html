<br>
<p><em>&gt; computers get faster and for what? to play games?
</em><br>
<p>And act as a prosthetic to the human imagination.  Modelling chemicals
<br>
(including nanodevices) to design their properties in lieu of the real
<br>
thing (whether because of cost or, as in nano, to decide what we want
<br>
to build while the factory is still being invented).  Practice for
<br>
various tasks (say, airline piloting) without the expense of actually
<br>
doing the thing for training (or, granted, for recreation).  And, of
<br>
course, as an aid to human communication (witness this list, a
<br>
community of people grouped by interest rather than mere geography).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; fifty years since world war two, and the greatest advance in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military technology is reliability and rate of fire in firearms that project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead bullets.
</em><br>
<p>Not counting, say, research in non-lethal weaponry so that people in
<br>
combat don't have to resort to lead bullets as often.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; we have looped ourselves. the answer is not  just technology, but a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological self awareness. and the ability to change, that  this self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness brings.
</em><br>
<p>This one's a bit different: people have been banging their heads
<br>
against the wall of getting others to be more aware for thousands of
<br>
years.  Though the right kind of tech might be the solution...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; i realise that this is a highly technical list.
</em><br>
<p>Not really.  The technical expertise is scattered across so many
<br>
disciplines that most of the list is probably layman-equivalent in any
<br>
one field.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;but i know that you agree
<br>
<em>&gt; with me, when i say that there are many ways just to improve your biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind that people ignore.
</em><br>
<p>Or are not aware of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but my question remains. what of us? (i for the purposes of this point out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that i am far closer to the masses than the post-human, with my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-limiting mindsets, and dim horizons) i am a person who is trapped by my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought-processes and mindsets, yes, but i am trapped nonetheless.
</em><br>
<p>You are at least aware of the possibility of boundless improvement, and
<br>
are conciously willing to try to attain such.  That alone sets you apart
<br>
from the masses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; how will you help me, and my friends like me? what is it that the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offers me, and you who see it, and lust after it so keenly?
</em><br>
<p>Most people prefer to list higher goals that may be attained through the
<br>
future they desire, and they are correct in listing them.  I prefer to
<br>
acknowledge my unbridled greed - more money (or equivalent societal
<br>
influence), more physical/mental power, more abilities, more, more, MORE
<br>
- but taint it with the recognition that the surest and fastest way for
<br>
me to profit is if at least part of humanity profits with me (the part
<br>
that could tear me down out of envy if I shut them out, or, more
<br>
importantly, could help me realize this bounty for myself and them).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; i have heard you call yourself post-human, but i am just a young man. not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even a very clever one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how do we get from here to there?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is the bridge that i am missing?
</em><br>
<p>Post-human is a relative term.  For example, few if any of us are
<br>
genuine cyborgs, fewer still in the augmented sense (as opposed to just
<br>
having a replacement hip or similar).  Only in the mental arena is it
<br>
currently widely possibly to upgrade, and even then our methods are
<br>
crude compared to what we wish to achieve.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; i realize this isn't very clear, and very long and boring. but if someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could struggle through it, and show me what it is, and where the road
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starts, i would be grateful.
</em><br>
<p>The road has already started.  Exactly where and when might be a topic
<br>
of eternal debate, but humanity is now on it.  The challenge is for us
<br>
to keep on it, and advance down it.
<br>
<p>That said, pick your path.  Intelligent software, nanotech, biotech,
<br>
space...the fields are out there for you to choose from.  In your
<br>
particular case, you might want to approach some of the more open-minded
<br>
of your professors to ask what areas you'd need to study to be a
<br>
professional in each of these fields (if one of them says a field is
<br>
useless, find another prof), and sample the areas to see what you like.
<br>
Be warned that the reccomendations are likely to be tilted towards
<br>
academia, but there is also a great need for businesses which
<br>
sucessfully exploit these fields (opening them up for practical public
<br>
use), whether you start your own or sign up with someone else's effort.
<br>
And there are other paths...
<br>
<p>Note that we are further along than most people think we are.  If and
<br>
when the Singularity happens, will most people even know?  How will they
<br>
find out?  One usually must seek benefits out to reap them...
