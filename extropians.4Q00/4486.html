<p>In this letter, Ray Kurzweil makes the same claim I heard him
<br>
make in his keynote address this past summer at PC Expo in New
<br>
York -- namely, that the 21st century will encompass 20,000 years
<br>
of technological progress, measured as the amount of progress
<br>
accomplished in one calendar year at the current (year 2000)
<br>
rate, because (Kurzweil claims) technological progress is and
<br>
will continue to be described by an exponential curve.  He made
<br>
the same claim at that Spiritual Robots seminar at Stanford
<br>
hosted by Douglas Hofstadter and in a recent article in an
<br>
on-line magazine called &quot;Business 2.0&quot; at
<br>
<a href="http://www.business2.com/content/magazine/indepth/2000/09/12/17734">http://www.business2.com/content/magazine/indepth/2000/09/12/17734</a>
<br>
<p>This statement (that the next century will see the equivalent of
<br>
20,000 years of progress at today's rate) is certainly a very
<br>
potent rhetorical device, which rivets the audience's attention
<br>
and gets their adrenaline surging (either out or fear or
<br>
anticipation!)  A friend of mine, who was with me at PC Expo,
<br>
asked me later exactly how this 20,000 years will be distributed
<br>
over the next century, and apart from saying that most of it will
<br>
be stuffed into the last decades, I never bothered to provide him
<br>
with a better answer.
<br>
<p>However, I later resurrected some college calculus, and after a
<br>
bit of stumbling around, came up with an exponential function (a
<br>
pair of them, actually -- one is the derivative of the other)
<br>
that, if I did the math correctly, gives some interesting
<br>
intermediate numbers between now and 2100, and fits Kurzweil's
<br>
20,000-year figure closely enough.
<br>
<p>The function E(x), which gives the total elapsed technological
<br>
progress (in years at current year 2000 rate of progress) between
<br>
now (year 2000, x=0) and a century from now (year 2100, x=100)
<br>
is:
<br>
<p>E(x) = (13.8 * e^.0725x) - 13.8
<br>
<p>The function I(x), which gives the instantaneous rate of progress
<br>
relative to the current (year 2000) rate, is:
<br>
<p>I(x) = d/dx E(x) = e^.0725x
<br>
<p>Here are some representative values:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elapsed              E(x)                     I(x)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time (yrs) (Total Progress since 2000) (Instantaneous Rate)
<br>
Year   (since 2000)    (years at 2000 rate)   (compared to 2000 rate)

<br>
<p>As you can see, it kind of sneaks up on you!
<br>
<p>HOWEVER, it later occurred to me that these numerically
<br>
impressive &quot;years at current rate of progress&quot; numbers start to
<br>
look a little fluffy if you shift your Year 0 point of view
<br>
backward a few decades (which I've already lived long enough to
<br>
do while staying within the span of years encompassed by my own
<br>
personal memories) and use the formula to compute &quot;years at
<br>
then-current rate of progress&quot; looking forward to the present
<br>
from that past vantage point.  For example, according to the
<br>
exponential function I plotted (derived from Kurzweil's
<br>
20,000-years-in-the-next-century statement), between now and
<br>
2040, there will be 237 years of progress at the year 2000 rate.
<br>
OK, so that also means (assuming the same curve was in effect)
<br>
that there's been 237 years of progress at the **1960** rate of
<br>
progress between 1960 and now.
<br>
<p>I was thinking of a science-fiction story by Robert A. Heinlein
<br>
called _The Door Into Summer_ (there are, of course, hundreds of
<br>
similar examples), which was written in 1956.  This story starts
<br>
around 1970 (only 14 years in the future, from the point of view
<br>
of its authorship), by which time, Heinlein imagines, there will
<br>
be household robots (the hero of the story is an engineer and
<br>
entrepreneur who had founded a company called &quot;Hired Girl, Inc.&quot;
<br>
[now **that** really dates the story!] and is forced out by his
<br>
business partners).
<br>
<p>Now, looking forward from 1956, Heinlein plausibly (for the time)
<br>
imagined useful robots by 1970, 14 years later.  Remember, those
<br>
were the heady days of the earliest commercial digital computers
<br>
(&quot;electronic brains&quot;) and Alan Turing's speculations about the
<br>
possibility of artificial intelligence, as well as of the
<br>
post-war consumer electronics boom (the beginning of the Age of
<br>
Television).  Heinlein might have been mildly disappointed if
<br>
you'd told him that consumer housecleaning robots wouldn't have
<br>
been invented even by the year 2000, 44 years later.  He would
<br>
**certainly** have been disappointed if you'd gone on to tell him
<br>
that, since progress is exponential, that 44-year gap is really
<br>
equivalent to something like 350 years at the &quot;1956 rate of
<br>
progress&quot;.  He might think, &quot;wow, 350 years ain't what it's
<br>
cracked up to be!&quot;.  He would probably have been appalled if
<br>
you'd then added that technology optimists in 2000 now anticipate
<br>
that such devices might start showing up around 2040, after
<br>
**more than six thousand years** of progress at the 1956 rate!!
<br>
<p>I suspect our **expectations** of the future may be exponential
<br>
in some sense, too.  In other words, we can imagine all sorts of
<br>
things we'd like to have or do, and even portray them to the masses
<br>
by means of TV shows like _Star Trek_, many of which (like
<br>
intelligent machines or immortality) are out of reach to an
<br>
indeterminate degree compared to what is possible with today's
<br>
technology.  Kurzweil says we've all adapted to and internalized the
<br>
current rate of change, which causes us to underestimate the
<br>
progress that will occur during a future calendar period (like
<br>
the next century), but I wonder if our unbounded hopes for
<br>
the future make our linear view the more realistic one, even
<br>
if Kurzweil's exponential curve is accurate.
<br>
<p>There's a special edition of _Newsweek_ magazine on the
<br>
newsstands right now entitled &quot;Issues 2001&quot; which has a section
<br>
called &quot;The Technological Human&quot; starting on p. 46 and containing
<br>
nine articles.  One of these, on p. 50, is entitled &quot;2001: Why
<br>
HAL Never Happened&quot;.  The article's author, Steven Levy, says
<br>
that &quot;Marvin Minsky, the celebrated MIT computer scientist who
<br>
was one of Kubrick's gurus on the subject, had blurted to _Life_
<br>
magazine [sometime in the late 60's, presumably] that within a
<br>
few years, 'we will have a machine that will be able to read
<br>
Shakespeare, grease a car, play office politics, tell a joke,
<br>
have a fight.'&quot;  Levy then goes on to say, &quot;More recently, to
<br>
author David Stork, [Minsky] has called the quote a joke, and
<br>
says that he has always believed we'll have HAL-like computers
<br>
'in between four and 400 years'&quot;.  Minsky means calendar years,
<br>
presumably.
<br>
<p>Let's see -- in terms of &quot;years at the current (Y2K) rate of
<br>
progress&quot; (blending Kurzweil's exponential math and Minsky's
<br>
revised timeline for AI) we should expect HAL-like computers
<br>
after anywhere between about 4.6 years and 54 trillion years
<br>
of continued technological progress (at the current year 2000 rate).
<br>
<p>That sounds about right!  ;-&gt;  ;-&gt;  ;-&gt;
