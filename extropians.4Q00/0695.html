Has there ever been a study done on people who are slim naturally (and maybe
<br>
those who really enjoy a low cal diet)?  I wonder if they live longer.
<br>
<p>I don't know if they are slim, but the Okinawans of Japan naturally eat a
<br>
slightly calorie restricted diet, and tend to live longer. The October issue
<br>
of Life Extension magazine talks briefly about this (was this already
<br>
mentioned?).
<br>
<p><p>On average, Okinawans appear to eat a mild version of the CR diet. Okinawans
<br>
live much longer than genetically similar people on a more traditional
<br>
Japanese diet. If the longest-lived of different Japanese sub-populations
<br>
are compared, the difference is striking. According to a recent study, the
<br>
overall proportion of centenarians in Japan was 21.6/100,000 people in 1990.
<br>
By prefecture, the highest proportion of centenarians, by far, was in
<br>
Okinawa. In Okinawa, the centenarian rate was found to be 133.8/100,000-a
<br>
statistically significant difference. Note that this is the highest
<br>
corroborated per capita centenarian rate in the world, among a large cohort.
<br>
<p><p>If you are slim &quot;naturally&quot; you probably have a fast metabolism, which isn't
<br>
good for anti-aging. Not many people will willingly restrict calories for
<br>
long periods of time, while maintaining adequate nutrition, while food is
<br>
abundant. Evolution favors fast growth and abundant breeding, and that can
<br>
best be accomplished with an inbred desire for high calorie foods to insure
<br>
our survival. So true CR is hard to find in a natural environment, and
<br>
humans are difficult subjects to study because of their long life spans.
