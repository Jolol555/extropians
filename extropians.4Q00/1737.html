Anal retentiveness forces me to specify that I was talking about the

<p>Avoid the emotion of frustration, don't doubt your goals while you're
<br>
working, always know what you're trying to do at any given time, and
<br>
take off a few minutes to figure it out.  Don't dwell on failures. 
<br>
Don't put off the primary task; find something worse and put that off by
<br>
working.  Recurse on obstacles before dismissing them as insuperable.
