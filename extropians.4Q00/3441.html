<p>You could be a transhumanist of any of those brands (although some are more 
<br>
likely than others) but NOT a fascist one. There has been considerable 
<br>
discussion about this and the general view was (correctly IMO) that fascism 
<br>
is logically incompatible with transhumanism. To see this we must 
<br>
understand (1) our roots in humanism, and (2) the strong emphasis that 
<br>
transhumanism places on individual choice.
<br>
<p>Regarding (1), consider the final clause in the Transhumanist Declaration 
<br>
(<a href="http://www.transhumanism.com/declaration.htm">http://www.transhumanism.com/declaration.htm</a>):
<br>
<p>&quot;Transhumanism advocates the well-being of all sentience (whether in 
<br>
artificial intellects, humans, non-human animals, or possible 
<br>
extraterrestrial species) and encompasses many principles of modern secular 
<br>
humanism.&quot;
<br>
<p>Suppression of one group by another clearly violates the &quot;well-being of all 
<br>
sentience&quot; clause. Moreover, if you read any summary of secular humanism 
<br>
(you can find several on the web) you will see that it is totally contrary 
<br>
to fascist policies. (I know of just one instance of a self-ascribed 
<br>
&quot;fascist transhumanist&quot; and he is simply misusing the term &quot;transhumanist&quot; 
<br>
just as much as if someone called himself a &quot;fascist extropian&quot;.)
<br>
<p>Regarding (2), see e.g the following section from the FAQ 
<br>
(<a href="http://www.transhumanist.org/#ethical">http://www.transhumanist.org/#ethical</a>)
<br>
<p>&quot;Is there any ethical standard by which transhumanists judge &quot;improvement 
<br>
of the human condition&quot;?
<br>
<p>Transhumanism is compatible with a variety of ethical systems, and 
<br>
transhumanists themselves hold many different views. Nonetheless, the 
<br>
following seems to constitute a common core of agreement:
<br>
<p>According to transhumanists, the human condition has been improved if the 
<br>
conditions of individual humans have been improved. In practice, the 
<br>
individual is usually the judge of what is good for himself or herself. 
<br>
Therefore, transhumanists advocate individual freedom, especially the moral 
<br>
right for those who so wish to do to use technology to extend their mental 
<br>
and physical capacities and to improve their control over their own lives.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;From this perspective, an improvement to the human condition is a change 
<br>
that gives increased opportunity for individuals to shape themselves and 
<br>
their lives according to their informed wishes. Notice the word &quot;informed&quot;. 
<br>
It is important that people are aware of what they are choosing between. 
<br>
Education, freedom of information, information technology, idea futures, 
<br>
and potentially intelligence amplification, can help people make choices 
<br>
that are more informed. (Idea futures is a proposed market where people 
<br>
would place bets on uncertain scientific hypotheses or predictions about 
<br>
the future, thus encouraging an honest consensus. Hanson (1990).)&quot;
<br>
<p>- It's worth emphasizing that just because transhumanism does not include 
<br>
something per definition, that doesn't mean that denying it is a reasonable 
<br>
thing to do for any individual transhumanist. For example, nothing in 
<br>
transhumanism implies that the Earth is round, so in principle you could be 
<br>
a flat-earth-transhumanist. That would not be contradictory, just very 
<br>
stupid. Similarly with some political beliefs. It would be a mistake, IMO, 
<br>
to try to bake every reasonable belief into the definition of 
<br>
transhumanism. That way lies dogma and futile system-building. Much better 
<br>
to see transhumanism for what it is - an evolving body of views and values 
<br>
relating to some of the issues raised to the prospect of radical human 
<br>
enhancement technologies.
