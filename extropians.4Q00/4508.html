<p>Have you ever read the Iron Man comic book?  Iron Man wore an augmented power suit
<br>
made out of steel or some alloy.  Thus he could fly.  He worked from time to time
<br>
with Nick Fury in that comic book universe.  A graphic novel of him was among the
<br>
first computer-generated graphic novels.
<br>
<p>I have some PDAs but mostly use my computer.  I like the wireless PDAs because you
<br>
can carry them around.
<br>
<p>This thread was talking about ecash.  Basically, for e-cash you need some
<br>
non-repudiable scrip.  You can do that anonymously over the Internet using
<br>
pre-agreed certificates that have some byzantian level of security around the root
<br>
certificate.
