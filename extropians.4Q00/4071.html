Yeah, economics courses are useful, psychology courses are useful, and
<br>
law courses are useful, maybe some marketing courses, but generally I'd
<br>
recommend you get a BS in something real then get your MBA if you want
<br>
some business expertise, or else take some extension courses at night.

<em>&gt; &gt; Jeremy if I could turn back the clock the one thing I would've done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as far as school is concerned is I would have taken more business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; classes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure I agree with you, Brian, about taking business classes. I took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a number of business classes at the University of Texas and have also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started and operated businesses. I learned much more about business by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually engaging in it than by studying about it. Unless your goal is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get a job with a person or organization that requires business classes as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admission ticket, I'd advise you to start a business in order to learn about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business (and even if you DO need a business degree as a ticket, it's still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good to get some practical experience). You don't need a huge amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capital in order to do this, and it can be done &quot;on the side&quot; without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely disrupting the rest of your life. Keep your eyes and ears open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for things or services people need that you could provide. As far as I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been able to determine, the same general economic principles apply to both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tiny and huge businesses. A lot of the stuff they teach in university
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classes is based on unrealistic assumptions, some of it's pure BS; but out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the streets you gain practical wisdom which you can put to use in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real-life situations. With respect to summer jobs, internships, and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forth, IMO most &quot;management trainee&quot; jobs in large companies teach social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills but not how to run businesses (not to say that social skills aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely useful).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Go to a discount bookstore and find a copy of &quot;The millionare next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; door, or the millionare mind&quot; this weekend and start reading. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may help re-inspire you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another good book is _Rich Dad, Poor Dad_.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as non-business classes to take, I'd suggest sampling as many things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as possible. You may find something that ignites your interest. When I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in school I found that my mind seemed sharper if I took at least one math
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course each semester. Even now I find that I can think more clearly if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend at least half an hour each day engaged in mathematical play.
</em><br>
