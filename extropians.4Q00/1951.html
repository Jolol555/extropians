The following is an excerpt from the URL listed.  It's speculative at the
<br>
present time, but IMO this is a far better technology to aim for than
<br>
building toxins into our food.

<br>
<p>Smaller fractal robots can be used to control pests especially those that
<br>
hide in fractal space (the tiny nooks and crannies found in small areas).
<br>
The pest control can be 100% effective. This however is a dangerous
<br>
option. Wherever pest control has been introduced, all efforts to
<br>
eradicate some pest or another produce newer and super varieties of pests
<br>
because the only ones that survive are by natural selection more fit and
<br>
more able to overcome their adversaries in nature. Even if a pest was
<br>
eradicated, a totally new and unexpected one will take its place.
<br>
Whatever the method of pest control, be it chemical or be it traps, the
<br>
result is always the same. The problem with farming as practiced today is
<br>
that it has to produce large monocultures of one crop which then favours
<br>
breeding of huge monocultures that feed on these vast food reserves. It
<br>
is not possible to eradicate such large monocultures of pests because
<br>
they have amplified genetic variety that can withstand increasingly
<br>
severe pest control systems.
<br>
<p>Instead of eradicating pests, we can talk about managing pests. Very
<br>
small pests that infest a leafy plant is difficult at best of times to
<br>
recognise and eradicate because of their size. They are small and hide in
<br>
every nook and cranny which in surface area alone is vastly inflated than
<br>
what we might measure with a big ruler at our scale. The the pest scale,
<br>
it is a vast space and good for hiding  - i.e. they hide in fractal
<br>
space. To hunt down such pests, a fractal robot is needed to search out
<br>
pests in this fractal space - i.e. we need a robot that can reach into
<br>
smaller nooks and crannies where these pests might be hiding. Fractal
<br>
robots around 100 microns in size is adequate for many pests to be
<br>
eradicated.
<br>
<p>Once we have a small army of tiny predatory robots, it can be sent into a
<br>
field to manage the number of pests in the field. We don't want to wipe
<br>
out everything. We need to set a minimum count for the number of pests we
<br>
would like in an area. Anything over that is culled. Larger fractal
<br>
robots can be used to manage larger pests such as rodents by sniffing out
<br>
their burrows and controlling their numbers (once again - we do not need
<br>
100% culling).
<br>
<p>Another potential way to manage pests is to get rid of monoculture
<br>
farming techniques and replace it with multi-culture farming techniques.
<br>
A field might contain soil that suits different plants and we could put
<br>
all those plants there if we knew where we put each plant and we had a
<br>
machine to harvest each fruit. The likelihood of monocultures of pests
<br>
developing are reduced because it is more than probable that predators
<br>
that live on one kind of plant is also likely to feed on other insects
<br>
that live in other plants thereby indirectly controlling the population
<br>
of both since if there is no food, the predator does not proliferate. To
<br>
economically farm such a jumbled up field, it is necessary to have a
<br>
machine that can harvest all the different kinds of produce in one go
<br>
without the farmer having to buy separate tools for each produce - and
<br>
also without having to send out men and machines to hunt down the right
<br>
produce.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike, I am certainly no fan of the FDA, but I think I have to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; with them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; on this one.  The food in question is engineered to produce its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; pesticide.  This new corn is not chemically equivalent to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; corn, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is chemically equivalent to natural corn plus pesticide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Given that toxins tend to concentrate in urine, milk, and fat I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want to drink milk or eat meat from animals that had been fed this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corn,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nor would I want to use manure from these animals on my garden.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a bit strange considering that you are already consume 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based products from animals fed foods quite saturated with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pesticides. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point of modifying a plant genetically to produce its own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pesticide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that it produces just enough (and if possible of a happier 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemical)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for its needs.  This results in much lower concentration of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pesticides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than non-genetic means like spraying crops.  The latter is a shotgun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach and likely to result in much higher health risks and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accidental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contamination of nearby lifeforms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've had the experience of using manure from horses who'd been fed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cut from pastures sprayed with 2,4-D. The herbicide residue in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; killed all my broad leaf plants. Even the county ag extension 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agent here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who was educated at a university which advocated the liberal use 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pesticides in agriculture now questions whether it is, afterall, a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly.  Old style pesticide use is much more dangerous.  However, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of pesticides must be used to have effective crop yields.  So 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do what is most controllable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  I doubt that it's any worse to eat Starlink corn itself than it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to eat animals who'd been fed on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually it should be much better to eat animals fed this corn and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corn itself than corn that had been massively sprayed the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old-fashioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way.  The pesticide is in the plant but not necessarily as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the actual corn.  But I would need to see studies on that idea.
