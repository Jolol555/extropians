<p><em>&gt; &gt; It's interesting to consider that greater knowledge of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's also worth noting that greater freedom may well

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would either of these assertions have any basis?
</em><br>
<p>A trivial example: Not every possible product is released
<br>
into the marketplace to compete; a large number of potential
<br>
product designs are dismissed or not even considered.  An
<br>
increase in the intelligence or knowledge of the product
<br>
designer(s) would result in a greater number of designs
<br>
being dismissed or not considered before production.
<br>
<p>An increase in knowledge about the marketplace results in
<br>
the centralisation of decision making in the design process.
<br>
Consumers making purchasing decisions cannot necessarily use
<br>
the same knowledge to their advantage.  The same is true of
<br>
knowledge about society, which by necessity must be formed
<br>
from a centralised perspective.  Purposeful design, if
<br>
possible, will always be superior to spontaneous order (if
<br>
it isn't designed, it's badly designed).
<br>
<p>A society purposefully designed (and therefore &quot;governed&quot;)
<br>
for freedom will offer greater freedom than an anarchy.
