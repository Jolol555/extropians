</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; wrote: criteria the IRS uses for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deciding whether an organization qualifies as a tax-exempt &quot;church&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ==
</em><br>
<p>OK, well, lets try this then:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1 Provide a brief history of the development of the organization, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reasons for its formation.
</em><br>
<p>We give the actual one, along with the fabricated Broderickjo history.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2 Does the organization have a written creed or statement of faith? Yes No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If “Yes,” attach a copy.
</em><br>
<p>The extropian principles, v. 3.0.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3 Does the organization require prospective members to renounce other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious beliefs or their membership in other churches or religious orders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to become members? No Yes
</em><br>
<p>Wellllll, no, I suppose not.  Pure reason might require this, but I dont think
<br>
this extrojo church requires it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4 Does the organization have a formal code of doctrine and discipline for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its members? Yes No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If “Yes,” describe.
</em><br>
<p>The extropian principles is the formal code.  Discipline?  Dont know,
<br>
but it kinda has a sexy ring to it...  {8^D
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5 Describe the form of worship and attach a schedule of worship services.
</em><br>
<p>The occasional extro-schmoozes?  Schedule of worship, well, the
<br>
related Foresight Institute Nanoschmoozes on third Thursday of the
<br>
month might hafta do.  Form of worship?  Its kinda sorta just a
<br>
big yakkity yak session mostly.  We love em.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 6 Are the services open to the public? No Yes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If “Yes,” describe how the organization publicizes its services and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain the criteria for admittance.
</em><br>
<p>Yes!  On the chat group.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 7 Explain how the organization attracts new members.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I dont know how that happens.  Does anyone here know this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 8 (a) How many active members are currently enrolled in the church?
</em><br>
<p>How many extropian members are there?  Max?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (b) What is the average attendance at the worship services?
</em><br>
<p>If you count the Foresight schmoozes, we have been getting a
<br>
couple dozen.  The approximately bi-annual extroschmoozes,
<br>
a couple hundred.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 9 In addition to worship services, what other religious services
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (such as baptisms, weddings, funerals, etc.) does the organization conduct?
</em><br>
<p>No baptisms, no weddings that I know of, two very heartbreaking
<br>
funerals so far, if you count a cryosuspension as a funeral.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 10 Does the organization have a school for the religious instruction of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; young? Yes No
</em><br>
<p>No, but we have one for the old.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 11 Were the current deacons, minister, and/or pastor formally ordained after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a prescribed course of study? No Yes
</em><br>
<p>NO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 12 Describe the organization’s religious hierarchy or ecclesiastical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government.
</em><br>
<p>HA!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 13 Does the organization have an established place of worship? Yes No
</em><br>
<p>In front of our computers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 14 Does (or will) the organization license or otherwise ordain ministers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or their equivalent) or issue church charters? No Yes
</em><br>
<p>Doubt that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 15 Did the organization pay a fee for a church charter? Yes No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If “Yes,” state the name and address of the organization to which the fee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was paid, attach a copy of the charter, and describe the circumstances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surrounding the chartering.
</em><br>
<p>Extropian dues?  Alcor dues?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 16 Show how many hours a week the minister/pastor and officers each devote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to church work and the amount of compensation paid to each of them. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the minister or pastor is otherwise employed, indicate by whom employed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nature of the employment, and the hours devoted to that employment.
</em><br>
<p>Um, folks, I dont think this extrojo religion thing is gonna fly.  {8-[  There
<br>
should be *some* way we can tap into this anti-hate-crime ultra politically
<br>
correct environment to get the right to not be murdered by autopsy.  spike
