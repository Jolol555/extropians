<p><em>&gt;One reform I hope to see come out of this situation is some kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of standard balloting system. Computers could be used to make most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of these irregularities impossible. They could make it impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to submit an illegal ballot. They could display the names of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;candidates the voter has tentatively chosen for his confirmation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They could warn him if he has left any office unvoted. To maintain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a paper trail as a safeguard, for each office voted a ballot slip
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could be printed: 10 offices, 10 slips. That would allow the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machine to pre-sort them by the voter's choices. If, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasonable tolerances, they had a standard weight, the machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;count could be verified by weighing each stack of ballot slips.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The voter could be given the chance to review the ballot slips for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;errors. He could abort and start over, or confirm and allow the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ballot slips to fall on the stacks. The tallies could be kept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;essentially in real time as the voting progressed, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the winner of a state would be known with certainty when the poll
</em><br>
<em>&gt;closed. This seems like a reasonable standard to me.
</em><br>
<p>Sometimes things move fast. This morning on the news, David Orr the
<br>
cook county registrar of voters was demonstrating a new idea.
<br>
<p>We've started using a desktop computer based machine that tabulates
<br>
the votes. Instead of dropping a ballot into a ballot box to be
<br>
counted later, Orr is suggesting placing the ballot directly into
<br>
the machine. The machine will reject it if there is a double vote,
<br>
so the person can vote over.
<br>
<p>This has to be voted on, and may be approved by the end of the
<br>
week.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As far as other voting systems I think you want to keep things as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simple as possible. That seems to be a weakness of the Borda
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system if there are many choices. How about just giving the voter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a chance to make a second choice?. As a first stage elimination
</em><br>
<em>&gt;determine the two highest vote-getters from first choices. If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;voter's first choice is not among the two highest, but his second
</em><br>
<em>&gt;choice is, then count his second choice in a second-stage
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supplemental count. Of course this could be generalized from 2
</em><br>
<em>&gt;choices and 2 counts to n choices and n counts if you wanted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Having two choices would make it more appealing to vote for an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'unelectable candidate'. The second choice could be kept for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mainstream candidate you least dislike. This system would make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much easier for a &quot;fringe&quot; party to gain substantial support. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for precisely that reason, I don't think there is a snowball's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chance in hell that the Dems and Reps would allow it to come into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;existence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But it's interesting to think about.
</em><br>
<p>I like the idea of a Borda system for the primary.
<br>
<p>On the day of the primary all states would vote.
<br>
<p>The first part of the ballot would give you the opportunity to list
<br>
a party affiliation, Democratic, Republician, Green, Libertarian,
<br>
Extropian, what have you.
<br>
<p>Then you would vote for the candidates, all candidates, in your
<br>
order of preference. This would allow for a number of different
<br>
types of analysis based on location, party affiliation, what have
<br>
you. This primary could be preceded by debates in which all
<br>
candidates could participate.
<br>
<p>The results of this primary would be good fodder for the individual
<br>
parties conventions.
