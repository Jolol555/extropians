<p>I don't think it makes sense to talk about side effects of changing
<br>
discount rates, because that isn't a specific policy which can have
<br>
such effects.  You could talk about the side effects of changing
<br>
interest rates, or rates of taxation on capital, or subsidizing
<br>
education, etc.  But social discount rates are just a feature of
<br>
social preferences - and preferences don't have side effects, actions
<br>
do.
