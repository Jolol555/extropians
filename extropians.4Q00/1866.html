<p>I think the authors are making a mistake here. To the extent that 
<br>
&quot;discounting the future&quot; is merely a matter of weighing in the risk that 
<br>
things could go wrong before we reap the harvest on our investments, then 
<br>
their arguments don't show that dictatorship of the moment leads to 
<br>
suboptimal total preference satisfaction. Any benevolent social planner 
<br>
would also have to take that risk into account. This is an epistemic matter 
<br>
(&quot;we don't know the future&quot;) rather than a matter of incentives (&quot;we care 
<br>
too much about the present to freely optimize total preference satisfaction&quot;).
