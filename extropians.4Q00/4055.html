</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt;So we should dump everything at will into our little cage and see what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;happens?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's not exactly what I am arguing for is it? It is not what is happening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; now either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How not?  A company uses a new chemical, dumps it, and if and when sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence is found against it then it may be banned.  But lots of new chemicals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are produced, probably outpacing regulatory inspection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Proving that something is safe may be impossible.  But at least looking at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;persistent stuff to see what it might do seems only intelligent.  Look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;before you leap, yes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes and we do that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, how so?  Perhaps I'm ignorant of standard procedure; how do we look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ahead?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Electricity isn't created out of thin air you know, soot particles from gas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and coal, radioactive waste, magnetic fields around High Voltage wires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soot particles don't accumulate in fish at 2000x environmental concentrations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as far as I know.  Some radioactive waste does; radioactive dumping is banned.
</em><br>
<p>Except radioactive dumping that is in fact coal ash. Coal plant fly ash,
<br>
if it were produced by a nuclear plant, would be considered nuclear
<br>
waste. Because it is a coal byproduct though, it is salable as concrete
<br>
filler, is dumped in the ocean, and mixed in the soil used in grading
<br>
backyards and playgrounds. Radioactive heavy metal particles from this
<br>
ash accumulate in fish and the fatty tissues of children, and are
<br>
generally responsible for much of the 'hot spot' phenomena with leukemia
<br>
and other malignacies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The usual scientific argument against the fear of transmission wire fields is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the radiation is too pathetic to plausibly have any effect; if statistics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proved there was an effect, it'd be New Science.  The plausibility of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persistent and accumulative chemical causing damage is way higher.  In fact, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonder how many chemicals meet Sweden's definition and are harmless?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Fertilizers certainly are accumulative and is killing the low waters around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think they are accumulative.  They get used as food.  They don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poison things, they feed algae which swamp the area.
</em><br>
<p>and breed creatures like pfisteria, which has killed numbers of people,
<br>
and permanently paralyzed many more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  slow development/low risk               fast development/high risk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  poor society                                       wealthy society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And now that we're wealthy we can afford to be more cautious.  Especially as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the greater wealth gives us more power to fuck up if the risk happens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We have (very high) taxes on cars, gas, electricity, fertilizers, pesticides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and consumption in general. None of these &quot;enviromental&quot; taxes are used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better the enviroment. But to further their own agena.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regulations can be abused.  But in the US I think the EPA has done a good job
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of making things better.  Not that we're likely to adopt the precautionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle, especially with Bush in office.
</em><br>
<p>Regulations are built to be abused. We have a nuclear waste problem
<br>
because the EPA, thanks to greens pressure, is opposed to constructing
<br>
any breeder nuclear plants which are perfectly capable of eliminating
<br>
nuclear waste. You don't see France with the same waste problems we have
<br>
here because they use breeder reactors. The EPA doesn't allow the
<br>
recycling of many forms of toxic waste because the regulations say that
<br>
toxic wastes are supposed to be put in 50 gallon drums and stored. The
<br>
EPA won't allow blast furnaces to be built to flash remediate pcb laden
<br>
soils due to accusations that they releast dioxins into the environment,
<br>
when they are actually proven to operate at too high a temperature to
<br>
allow dioxins to escape.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Fair point. The safer the better. Only problem is that the greens are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attacking the test fields and destroying the crops. They don't want safe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; development, they want no development.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I hardly agree with experiment-breaking.  That's evil.  But not all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people concerned with the environment are anti-science Greens.  Some of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are scientists.
</em><br>
<p>Who get their funding from greens, and who provide science reports that
<br>
are misread and misinterpreted by the greens to further their agenda.
