<p>I think that many who fought for democratic nations did so because they were drafted
<br>
and thus legally obligated to go fight.  Those who had moral or ethical motivations
<br>
to do so were probably of the following camps:  1: those who sought to preserve and
<br>
extend democracy, 2: those fighting against atrocities against civilians, and 3:
<br>
those figting or working to promote democracy as well as bring about the downfall of
<br>
blatant tyranny.  Each one was an individual.
<br>
<p>World War II showed the United States encountering its highest ever levels of
<br>
&quot;socialization&quot; or perhaps more aptly &quot;statist centralization&quot; than existed before.
<br>
Resources were earmarked by the government and metered to the people, and people
<br>
were encouraged through state-censored media to invest their monies and other
<br>
resources in the government.
<br>
<p>My previous comment was perhaps short-sighted.  Since before recorded history,
<br>
groups of men have attacked others to take their resources or for other
<br>
motivations.  In World War II itself, there were almost certainly more attacks
<br>
against ethnic Chinese by Japanese occupying forces than internal Chinese dissident
<br>
crushes, yet I do not know any of these numbers for sure, and the government of
<br>
China itself has killed its citizens and otherwise violated their civil rights and
<br>
continues to do so, as it is the largest non-democratic state, for the time being.
<br>
<p>Of course, no state is completely capitalistic, or not, or democratic, or not.  They
<br>
simply do not exist, or are a philosopher's construction.
<br>
<p>Someone in an unrelated post noted that humans fight each other because there is no
<br>
one else to fight.  It's the species' immune system, in a metaphorical sense.
