<p>That's wonderful! I made similar experiences, especially my Dad wanted
<br>
me to learn as much as possible on both arts (mostly painting and
<br>
singing) and technology. But unlike my Mom, he has become quite a New
<br>
Ager (who also thinks that people shouldn't be immortal, but have many
<br>
kids to carry on their genes). 
<br>
Well, my parents have been divorced now for a long time.
<br>
My Mom likes cognitive sciences a lot, but she was never really happy
<br>
with the luddite-like attitude of many of the researchers in this field.
<br>
So, when I told her of the Extropian Principles and other information on
<br>
Extropianism, she simply shouted: &quot;Great! That's it!&quot;
<br>
I'm really very sorry that my Mom can't live closer to me, as she is
<br>
still in Germany.
