Hi everyone.  Pleased to be back.
<br>
<p>Having the opportunity to briefly puruse a vast cross-section of messages
<br>
(the accumulation in my absence) has given me some macro perspective on list
<br>
activities.  Very interesting actually.
<br>
<p>I'm pleased to find that the &quot;will AI be unfriendly?&quot; thread seemed to have
<br>
genuinely knocked itself out of its negative attractor state momentarily
<br>
(no, I'm not wrong, you're wrong, etc, repeat.)
<br>
<p>Although Eugene's comments were sensational (probably intentionally,) I do
<br>
think that he has helped to define an important tension (embrace vs.
<br>
reliquish)-- I think it is uncontested: we truly must excercise cautious
<br>
optimism.
<br>
<p>A comment: it isn't necessary or desirable for all of us to be cautious
<br>
adopters-- it is acceptable for us as a group to have some who are cautious
<br>
and some who are early adopters-- so long as we allow that we share a common
<br>
vision-- and so long as we allow that we are to a degree united by this
<br>
vision-- and so long as we temper our behavior in this context (we are
<br>
greater than the sum of our parts, etc.)
<br>
<p><pre>

<p>It's interesting as well to have had the opportunity to experience the
dialogue thread of individual posters over a longer period of time.  I took
this opportunity to apply the Turing test to list members: curiously,
several failed.  (Sorry Molloy, I'm on to you. :)
<p>---
<p>I really like that we've started a bisexual thread-- and I'm pleased to find
that a number of list members are forthcoming about their respective
sexualities-- let's face it folks, these are the days of miracles and
wonders.
<p>I, for instance, am a straight male, however I have long held that we
are -all- bisexual to a degree.  I disagree with the J.R. bot that this
distribution is unequally weighted amongst the sexes-- I suspect this
perception is as a result of the fact that:
<p>a) Women are less threatened/insecure regarding their sexuality.
<p>(probably as a result of:)
<p>b.) It is (still) (very generally) less societally acceptable to be a
bi-sexual male, than a bi-sexual female.  (In fact, as indicated, bi-sexual
females are often the stuff of male-fantasy.)
<p><p>This is a topic of some interest to me and I have a fair bit of direct
experience regarding issues of sexuality.
<p>I have been in close association with gay communities for many years.  I
have been an actor in the -theatre- for several years, I currently live in
Vancouver (San Fran North) and I have consistently been 'mistaken' as gay...
(I am an artist, I'm emotional, sensitve, I have good fashion sense (often
flamboyant) and I make lots of physical contact with individuals of both
genders)
<p>Indeed, I am often flattered by this assumption, and I am flattered by the
male attention I have accrued-- it is not an assumption that I have actively
sought to debunk.
<p>I am truly in favor of an individual's ability to love *people*.  I can't
deny that there is an important sexual/chemical aspect missing as far as my
appreciation of males goes-- but I am, nonetheless, extremely pleased by the
close relationships I have with them.
<p>I think it would be nice, actually, if we were all more fully (and
acceptably) bi-sexual-- I remember with some clarity being propositioned by
a male acquaintance of mine for whom I had the utmost respect and
admiration-- I can &quot;intellectually,&quot; in retrospect, recognize it as being a
pity that I could not generate 'deeper' feelings for him.
<p>Sorry, no butterflies.  (And, damn, it ain't worth shit if there ain't no
butterflies!)
<p><p>I also disagree that women are more attracted to bi-sexual men *in general,*
(As indicated, the reverse is more probably true,) although, to be honest,
my -personal- experience seems to suggest that women do find sexual (and
bi-sexual) -comfort- to be attractive (particularly once you get to know
them.)
