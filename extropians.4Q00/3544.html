<p>I disagree.  The Internet was not originally a commercial venture. 
<br>
It started as a free service to connect researchers with Arpanet in 
<br>
1969.  Military personnel got free access, as did graduate students 
<br>
in the computer departments.  The first search engines started 
<br>
appearing in 1990.  Archie, Veronica, WAIS, VSL, and the like, were 
<br>
all free.  The concept of paying for access or information didn't 
<br>
really become common until 1995 with the advent of AOL.  For decades, 
<br>
free access to information was the default.  It is the concept of 
<br>
paying for information that would have been zany or unforeseen by the 
<br>
early adopters.
