</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Due to a family medical emergency, I had to drop out of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussion, but I've been following the thread.  I read with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;appreciation the information, provided by both you and Harvey, on
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Glad your back, I hope everyone is okay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Despite my dislike of Al Gore, I think it's fair to say that Al
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Gore was ahead of the curve in the congress regarding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Internet.  I think that he at least raised the consciousness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;normally technophobic senators on this issue, and he should get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;credit for that.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My problem, however, is with what he actually said:  &quot;During my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creating the Internet.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;He could have said lots of things:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- I took the initiative to ease restrictions on access to what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would eventually become the Internet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- In the Senate, I championed bringing the technology of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Internet to the general public.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- I pushed legislation through congress that helped change the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Internet from something that was a little-known tool for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientists and academics into the publicly accessible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technological achievement of our generation.
</em><br>
<p>You should have been on his team. ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;.... but he didn't.  Instead, Al Gore - a professional politician
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who has spent his whole career expressing himself to the public -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chose to take almost complete credit for the creation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Internet.
</em><br>
<p>I have considerable problems with his inability to accurately state
<br>
the truth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes, I know that Republicans exaggerate what he said by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;misquoting, &quot;I invented the Internet.&quot;  Yes, I know that Democrats
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are right in saying that there was some truth in what he said.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Some truth, however, doesn't really cut it.  There was also &quot;some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;truth&quot; in statements from him and his mentor:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;I did not have sex with that woman&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;I drank lots of tea and was in the bathroom a lot&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;We just want to make sure that every vote is counted&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The parts of those statements, and what they imply, that aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;truth are what concern me.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;If anyone can show me, and prove to me, that I am wrong in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought or deed, I will gladly change.  I seek the truth, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never yet hurt anybody.  It is only persistence in self-delusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and ignorance which does harm.&quot;
