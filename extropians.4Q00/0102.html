&quot;David Lubkin&quot; wrote,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see.  That explains the absense of bickering on the list, between &gt;H and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians, among libertarians, and between cryonics organizations.
</em><br>
<p>That's correct. We just don't have a monolithic enemy like an anti-extropy
<br>
movement which has put millions of us to death and enslaved more of us in
<br>
concentration camps. How many of the two million Americans in the US penal
<br>
system are extropians? (Hint: not many).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That much I agree with.  Many leaders of Labor and Likud still bitterly
</em><br>
despise
<br>
<em>&gt; each other for acts allegedly committed by the other during the British
</em><br>
Mandate.
<br>
<em>&gt; Rabin was assassinated by a fellow Jew who believed he was betraying them by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; giving away land deeded to them by God.  Why, meetings of the Knesset are
</em><br>
almost
<br>
<em>&gt; as raucous as those of the House of Commons....
</em><br>
<p>I rest my case.

<p><p><p><p>&quot;I had lunch a while back with a friend who is an ex-deputy director of the CIA.
<br>
He told me a fascinating story. When he was hired, one of the first things he
<br>
did was get all his scientists together and say, &quot;OK, boys, what's the truth
<br>
about UFOs?&quot;  And they all told him the same thing--one, we're pretty sure
<br>
there's a lot of life out there in space and, two, there's not the slightest
<br>
evidence of their ever having contacted us. And, of course, that's exactly what
<br>
everybody knows, but it was nice getting it from that level. But even if that
<br>
conversation were made known, it still wouldn't convince the nuts who always
<br>
believe there's a cover-up.&quot;
