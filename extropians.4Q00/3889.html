<p>
i believe the key to property rights lies in whether or not the person can 
<br>
be considered to have originated or &quot;paid&quot; for the property in question. by 
<br>
sacrificing some quantity( work, other property, time, age, etc) you 
<br>
effectively create a balance of exchange. to deny the person property they 
<br>
have sacrificed for disrupts this balance. just as attributing property 
<br>
rights beyond their sacrifice also disrupts the balance. the question then 
<br>
becomes, what is a proper valuation of comparative property? i think the 
<br>
result, upon a proper valuation, will not be that some things cannot be 
<br>
owned, but that some things are simply far too valuable for the average 
<br>
human to be able to sacrifice anything to balance it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And of course the fundamental right to property grows out of one's right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to one's own life and to make one's own decisions and to live with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consequences.  If one has no right to property then there is no right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one's life or to the outcome of one's decisions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I do believe that property in many realms of ideas, especially software,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is theft however.  Or not exactly theft, but that applying property
</em><br>
<em>&gt;notions to software diminishes us and our abilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- samantha
</em><br>
<p>informantional, or idea property rights seem rather unclear at the moment. 
<br>
people feel that they did work for the idea, so they should have a certain 
<br>
ownership of it. however, i believe that principles and formulae exist 
<br>
whether we &quot;discover&quot; them or not. so a person cannot rightly be the owner 
<br>
of something simply be finding it.
<br>
to apply the current law in information ownership, columbus would have had 
<br>
property rights to the western hemisphere, as the indigineous poeple 
<br>
obviously didn't have any legislative support, they would have been unable 
<br>
to protest this. i don't think that discovery means ownership, but 
<br>
development does give you the right to implement it first. just as racing to 
<br>
the store faster than anyone else, allows you to get the best pickings. it's 
<br>
an inherent right, and not an invented or supported one.
<br>
<p>to return to my earlier point, i think that it also supports samantha's 
<br>
point that informational ownership is harmful. because in a proper 
<br>
valuation, design, formulae, and processes can be, and often are, 
<br>
fantastically valuable, meaning people would need to go to equally fantastic 
<br>
lengths to &quot;own&quot; them.
<br>
<p>in a properly valued society. which it isn't.
<br>
c'est la vie.
