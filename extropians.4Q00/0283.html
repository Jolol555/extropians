<em>&gt;You might as well say he argues for nano Difference Engines in preference

</em><br>
<p>We can talk about the point of view of a work of fiction, and when doing
<br>
so it is largely irrelevant what the author actually thinks, or what points
<br>
of view he presents in other works of fiction.   Similarly when I read an
<br>
academic article, I evaluate the argument presented there, and for that
<br>
purpose it really doesn't matter if the authors came to exactly the opposite
<br>
conclusion in some other paper.
<br>
<p>I still claim that MacLeod's Cassini Division has a point of view against
<br>
uploads that do not retain human form, environment, speed, level, and styles
<br>
of thought.  I grant that MacLeod himself may not share this view, and that
<br>
other books of his may have other views.  I also grant that nano-computers
<br>
are not essential to the point of view of the novel, and that the book's
<br>
point of view doesn't really care much about them one way or the other.
<br>
But I do think the book's point of view does care about some things.
