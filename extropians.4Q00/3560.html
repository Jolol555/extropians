<p>
Utilizing Candy as a Tool of Psychological Warfare in the Workplace or,
<br>
&quot;How the Grinch Ruined the Office Christmas Party&quot;
<br>
<p>By Mike Lorrey
<br>
Chances are that in your workplace there are a number of people who keep
<br>
candy or fruit bowls on their desks. Many secretaries are slaves to
<br>
chocolate, I have found, especially Hershey's(R) Kisses(TM), as well as
<br>
various M&amp;Ms(TM), while programmers show a predeliction for bubble gum,
<br>
lolli-pops, butterscotch candy, and for those who forget to brush their
<br>
teeth for weeks on end, mints and hot balls.
<br>
<p>Because candy is such a food of self gratification, it is an effective
<br>
tool for using positive and negative re-inforcement techniques in
<br>
building or destroying office morale, esprit de corps, and general
<br>
productivity and creativity. I am sure there is a human resources person
<br>
somewhere trying to patent a mechanism to distribute controlled
<br>
quantities of candy throughout a cubicle ridden officeplace in exchange
<br>
for completed work units to maximize the efficiency of this concept. 
<br>
<p>Everyone is familiar with the tactic of buying candy or other food or
<br>
drink for your boss or other upper echelon person in order to butter up
<br>
those likely to promote. Its a classic tactic, sometimes taken to
<br>
extremes by some women (or demanded by some men). What many don't
<br>
realize is that they can use each piece of candy in the workplace as a
<br>
controlled dose of memetic confusion, uncertainty and doubt. 
<br>
<p>There are those who may desire to profit from the decreased productivity
<br>
in their workplace. Make a fortune in shorts on the futures market by
<br>
betting on reduced profits by your employer. Here I've listed a number
<br>
of ideas that the local self styled agent of the Erisian Liberation Army
<br>
can utilize to systematically and scientifically destroy workplace
<br>
cohesion as part of their own Operation Mindfuck.
<br>
<p>a) play 'musical candy', where after work you snag all the candy out of
<br>
one
<br>
person's bowl and put it all in another person's bowl. That will work
<br>
wonders to help spark workplace animosities. 
<br>
<p>b) kidnap ALL candy in the office one night, then put it all back the
<br>
following night.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
c) Mix up and/or swap people's candy bowl contents. 
<br>
<p>d) if you are concerned about your own susceptibility for candy, but are
<br>
trying to get THEM to gain weight, then what you want to do is fill the
<br>
bowl with candy that YOU don't like... or...
<br>
<p>e) buy candy to put in the bowls on THEIR desks... and they'll thank you
<br>
for being so generous too!!! 
<br>
<p>f) If you want to resist the temptation but are weak, what you can do is
<br>
pillage everyone else's candy bowls after hours and give it all to your
<br>
kids, nephews, or just kids playing at the local park. People will get
<br>
pissed and won't buy any more candy.
<br>
<p>f)  Now, if your aim is to get someone specific canned, or just in
<br>
trouble, put a whole pile of candy wrappers in their trash bin, then
<br>
suggest that people look for that evidence when they are on the warpath
<br>
in the morning...
<br>
<p>Now, if you have security cameras, there is obviously some risk to these
<br>
activities. One must be prepared and able to cover one's tracks.
<br>
Stocking type ski masks can cure this, but be sure to not have your
<br>
favorite shirt or pocket protector in plain view for people to identify
<br>
the perpetrator by.
<br>
<p>Repeat any or all of these suggestions until you have a workplace riven
<br>
with mistrust, paranoia, hostility, and an absolutely ruined team
<br>
spirit. At the very least, it will spark some very entertaining drunk
<br>
fights at your office christmas party. Oh, yeah, its beautiful.
