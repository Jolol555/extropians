GENERAL COMMENTS ON THIS THREAD:
<br>
<p>First of all, it is almost impossible for one, a modern of the
<br>
post-Renaissance expansion, to try to divine what primitives and ancients
<br>
actually thought unless there is enough surviving original material in which
<br>
to immerse oneself.
<br>
<p>This being said, it extremely easy to use flawed hindsight to impute to
<br>
ancient science, belief systems that they never held - or even to validate
<br>
such beliefs by correlation with modern beliefs.
<br>
<p>Secondly, fairly lengthy reading of the older Hindu literature shows that
<br>
there was an empirical approach... though it was based on introspective
<br>
analysis of the &quot;world within&quot;.  The ancient Hindus compared many such
<br>
observations, and there was actually a fair amount of dissent. All output of
<br>
such observation can't be summarily dismissed as groupthink.
<br>
<p>This tradition was expanded into two schemata: a minute dissection of the
<br>
atoms of consciousness; and an application to cosmology &amp; cosmogony.
<br>
<p>The basic premise was that, paraphrasing Bertrand Russell ( speaking in
<br>
respect of his own physical epistemological perspective ), ultimate
<br>
empiricism lay within the realm of the state of consciousness; and
<br>
everything else - including the macroscopic physical world and the process
<br>
and contents of consciousness themselves - were solely inferences.
<br>
<p>This was the hindu basis for unifying the physical &amp; mental Universe... from
<br>
moving from a primitive human picture of Case Based Reasoning to a Theory of
<br>
Everything.
<br>
<p>By working at the physical Universe &quot;inside out&quot; as it were, by assuming a
<br>
single Universal Entity and viewing all physics as interaction of the entity
<br>
with itself, the ancient hindus came upon a picture that bears some vague
<br>
similarity to a massively entangled universe that we ourselves are currently
<br>
uncovering, even though we have trodden quite a different path.
<br>
<p>I think the papers under discussion are not meant to be definitive evidence
<br>
of any high level theoretical physics of an Aryan past... but a clue that
<br>
may or may not lead to paydirt as our own physics progresses to something
<br>
more than the travesty that it currently is.
<br>
<p>Isaac Newton please forgive me.
