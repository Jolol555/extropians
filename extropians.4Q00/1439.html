<p>
Fellow voyagers on the starship Extroprize,
<br>
<p>In the dense underbrush of technogeek arcanery, I ever more frequently
<br>
stumble across yet another development in robotics.  The seeming spoor of
<br>
the x-y-z generations.  In remote clearings of the urban jungle, beneath
<br>
the blinding klieg of tribal torches, I sit transfixed, and bear witness to
<br>
robot wars, the nativity ritual of a new fascination.  Christined in a
<br>
shower of sparks, declared by a thud and scream of indignant metal,
<br>
swaddled in the intoxicating incense of combustion by-products, emerges the
<br>
promised one, the sacred Bot, and the dawn of the new age. 
<br>
<p>Last week, endeavoring as always to enhance my already rich fantasy life, I
<br>
sent a letter/proposal to MirCorp.  
<br>
<p>No matter whether they take me up on my 'proposal'.  It works quite nicely
<br>
as an 
<br>
e-business/adventure stand alone, with MirCorp providing a staging area,
<br>
and those surplus icbms I mentioned recently as the bargain basement boost
<br>
to their doorstep.
<br>
<p>Here's the letter.
<br>

<br>
<p>You have ignited the flame. We shall not permit it to be extinguished; We
<br>
shall make every effort so that the greatest dream of mankind might be
<br>
fulfilled.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Oberth to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky -
<br>
<p>I've been watching your Mircorp adventure unfold, and I'm frankly
<br>
fascinated and excited.  I'd like to share with you some of my thoughts.
<br>
<p>Have we reached a turning point in the evolution of human culture?  Does
<br>
the successful privatization and commercialization of Mir mark the
<br>
transition from the old way to the new?  Are we moving from the old
<br>
paradigm of Keynesian corporate military-industrial state, to a
<br>
free-market, space-exploring global society?  
<br>
<p>As the post-war generation, the baby boomers, reaches ascendancy, the
<br>
passing of generations brings with it a change of goals.  Their parents'
<br>
life experiences, predominated by the economic depths of the great
<br>
depression and the wartime victory over fascism, spawned the post-war era
<br>
goals--prosperity and security--of that generation.  Those goals have been
<br>
achieved, even as the generation which strived for them passes from the
<br>
scene.  What then of new goals?  The predominant influence of the post-war
<br>
era, the influence which made prosperity and security possible, has been
<br>
technology.  Technological dynamism, technological capability, and
<br>
technological sophistication are the hallmarks of the new age.
<br>
Unsurprisingly, the unlimited possibilities of a technology-mediated future
<br>
are central features of the new era.  In the heart of technological
<br>
sophistication humanity dreams of slipping the last of its shackles and
<br>
taking control of its destiny.  
<br>
<p>Mir is more than a space station, it is a doorway to the future.  A doorway
<br>
through which humanity is about to pass.  I personally believe it will be a
<br>
marvelous adventure.  Mircorp leads the way. 
<br>
<p>Mircorp is about attitude.  Mircorp captures the imagination. Let me show
<br>
you the future.
<br>
<p>MirBot.
<br>
<p>In the exploration of space, Mircorp is going to take up where others have
<br>
left off.  (So completely has their lack of imagination colored the
<br>
experience of space, that it  seems we all have blinders on regarding the
<br>
possibilities.)
<br>
<p>After rehabbing Mir, Mircorp will be leading the push to the moon, to
<br>
establish a moon base.  Rehabbing Mir is step one.  The moon base is step
<br>
two.  L-5 is step three.  L-5 is the natural site for a space colony, also
<br>
the natural site for the seed station of the L-5 colony.  It is also the
<br>
natural site for the launch to Mars and the Asteroids.  This then is the
<br>
progression: Mir, moon base, L-5, Mars/Asteroids.  
<br>
<p>MirBots are your space bots.  They go to the moon before humans.  They are
<br>
teleoperated, performing a full range of operations, and preparing for
<br>
later human arrival.  They'll be building and operating a system to process
<br>
material, and operating the launch system that sends the product to L-5.
<br>
<p>These are teleoperated robots, with eyes for remote viewing and
<br>
manipulators for remote,... well,... manipulation.  Control of the remote
<br>
bots will be at the desk top or laptop computer of the operator, wherever
<br>
they may be.  And they will, potentially, be every man, and every woman,
<br>
everywhere. 
<br>
<p>Now we have arrived at the threshold of one part of the business plan.  The
<br>
moment for making money has arrived.  The bots are made in quantity, like
<br>
high quality toys, hobbie items. Nearly identical to the ones that will go
<br>
to the moon.  Aibo barks like a dog.  My god, how feeble.  MirBot takes
<br>
your dreams to the stars.  Now that's a REAL technology application.
<br>
<p>The enthusiasm, dedication and skill that characterizes the new computer
<br>
culture, will make competition for teleoperation privileges for the moon
<br>
bots a worldwide craze.  The practice bots will be mass market &quot;toys&quot;, and
<br>
will sell by the millions.  The world will watch as thousands of regular
<br>
people become lunar explorers and builders. 
<br>
<p>But the world will do more than watch, it will take part. 
<br>
<p>By the way--bit of an aside here-- you really must find a way to sell
<br>
shares in this enterprise to those very same little people.  Gotta take
<br>
every opportunity to broaden the experience of participation.  I recommend
<br>
you register the company with a stock exchange--Vancouver perhaps--with
<br>
rules sufficiently relaxed so that the little people can get in on the
<br>
action.  It will be like paying to go to the movie, but at the same time
<br>
getting a percentage of the gross.  Everyone a member.  A citizen.  Of the
<br>
future.
<br>
<p>Back to the bots.  I think of them as weighing one Kg. apiece, on spider
<br>
legs, with front facing camera and manipulator arms.  (But this is just one
<br>
of an infinite number of possible designs.)  The experience of being the
<br>
operator, cosmonaut, explorer, worker, builder will not be confined to the
<br>
moon.  Every space venue will be the domain of these remote agents.
<br>
Because of the massive redundancy inherent in thousands of bots,
<br>
substantial failure rates can be easily tolerated; in fact, dialed in and
<br>
designed in as a part of minimizing the cost.  The individual bots will
<br>
have a short range communications ability, and will send their data outputs
<br>
long range via uplink.  The toy that is not a toy.  Do you think this &quot;toy&quot;
<br>
will sell?
<br>
<p>Thousands of people will get to travel virtually, but with hands on
<br>
interactive and active capability, to space: the moon, L-5, and Mir.  Let's
<br>
consider Mir.
<br>
<p>I hear that Mir has a fungus problem.  A gang of bots, appropriately
<br>
equipped, could remediate that.  Bot operators on Mir--What would you call
<br>
them?-- Botmonauts maybe -- will be serving alongside human space workers,
<br>
and making substantial contributions.
<br>
<p>Who can remember what it was like to think this way, after years of
<br>
disappointment and neglect?   But never mind that.
<br>
<p>Every bit of this adventure is made for tv, and for the emerging
<br>
computer-screen world.  MirTV.
<br>
<p>Walter, I'd like to come on board, there's so much more to this than I can
<br>
write about.  Everytime I get to thinking about it, it just seems to expand
<br>
away from me, the impact, the import becoming ever greater.
<br>
<p>The Mirbots can work in space as satellite-worker roughnecks.  They can do
<br>
eva more safely, more cheaply, and in much greater numbers than humans.
<br>
With an inventory of tools they could be customized for any job, and
<br>
perhaps exceed humans in precise dexterity.  They wouldn't have to exceed
<br>
humans in judgement because they would be humans-- remember the mind behind
<br>
the remotely operated tool.  
<br>
<p>Imagine a bot repair crew--three bots let's say-- drifting through the
<br>
blackness of space, with a box of tools and parts and a little jet pack and
<br>
a radio.  Gliding silently towards a rendezvous with some satellite in need
<br>
of maintenance.  Space spiders with special tools, and grippers on the ends
<br>
of their legs, and each with a tv camera point-of-view that can be tuned in
<br>
by any human on the planet.
<br>
<p>You're going to want to set up a ring of communication satellites whose
<br>
orbits are harmonic with Mir, and which can therefore be serviced when
<br>
periodically reencountered.  Maintainability substantially reduces the cost
<br>
of the system.  And upgradability means that the system retains, rather
<br>
than loses, value in the face of improving technology.  This way, MirCorp
<br>
controls and sells access to a global communications infrastructure, while
<br>
enjoying first priority free access to these services for its own use,
<br>
access subsidized by the cash customers.
<br>
<p>The Mirbots come in every marketing style from MacDonald's action figure
<br>
size, to coffee table, to what have you, and all of these are immediately
<br>
marketable.
<br>
<p>Apple secured its place in the digital culture by filling the schools with
<br>
its machines, and capturing the minds of the first generation of computer
<br>
users.  Mircorp can secure its place in the field of space exploration, and
<br>
exploitation, by capturing the minds of the first generation of space
<br>
explorers.  Make the development (and later deployment) of Mirbots a global
<br>
competition and a global effort.  Robotics is rapidly acquiring an almost
<br>
cult-like status among the current and coming generation of technological
<br>
adepts.  Mircorp's future lies with them, and they are yours for the
<br>
taking.  As with every new generation, they hunger for their dream, and
<br>
their piece of the future, looking for someone to fire their imagination,
<br>
and someone to give them a chance.
<br>
<p>I'd like to talk to you about MirBot and MirTV  development.  (Oh, did I
<br>
forget to tell you about MirTV, television for the future?  How could I
<br>
have missed that one?)
<br>
<p>Email, phone, drop me a line.
