<p>Which makes me wonder whether those who had really crappy childhoods are
<br>
more receptive to transhumanist memes. (ie. a childhood so bad there's
<br>
no way one can self-dupe into thinking it was better than present day)
<br>
In fact, from my own anecdotal experiences, I think this may be the
<br>
case.
<br>
<p>This may not be particularly PC, but there may be a huge untapped market
<br>
for transhumanist memes in people who had crappy childhoods, not from
<br>
boredom, but from more sinister events.  To someone who had a horrifying
<br>
early life, anything novel and different would help break associations
<br>
and routines developed in childhood.  What is more novel and different
<br>
than a transhumanist's vision of the future?  Or -- I would hope -- a
<br>
transhumanist lifestyle?
<br>
<p>I think I'll go even farther and say this might be a useful form of
<br>
therapy for people plagued by a nightmarish past.  &quot;Extro-therapy&quot; ...
<br>
for people with a strong sense of purpose combined with a troubled past,
<br>
I think a transhumanistic epiphany might be just what the doctor
<br>
ordered.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Calcify my ass.  We boomers are busy trying to get the younger
</em><br>
<em> &gt; generations to pick up our memes.  Do you know how depressing it is to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; watch every single generation have to relearn the same lessons?
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Harumph!  :-)
</em><br>
<p>Well, public education isn't doing a good job of this.  Popular media is
<br>
even worse. So what other methods are boomers employing to educate the
<br>
youngsters so they aren't doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past?
<br>
<p>An AI that could induce lessons from boomers and translate them to the
<br>
reference frame of a Nintendo-Generation-Youngster would be useful for
<br>
this task. Especially if it could relate these lessons based on everyday
<br>
questions posed by the Gen-Y'ers. Not there yet, though.  Eli?
<br>
<p>In the meantime, I think boomers would do best if they could try to
<br>
relate things to modern youths instead of using analogies
<br>
incomprehensible to youngin's raised on computers and arcade games.  If
<br>
they had a viral marketing team half as good as Pokemon's...
