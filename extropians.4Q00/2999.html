I have a stupid question about Joy's article and the title of the debate.
<br>
&quot;Why the Future Doesn't Need Us&quot;.  What does this mean, exactly?
<br>
<p>The future doesn't need us because... we're going to wipe ourselves
<br>
out?  That's kind of a weird way to put it.
<br>
<p>We wiped out the dodo.  Would we say the future didn't need the dodo,
<br>
as a synonym?
<br>
<p>A more plausible interpretation is to stick to the AI &quot;threat&quot;, and to
<br>
say that our machines will become more creative, more intelligent, more
<br>
*human* than we are, so they can carry on the legacy of the human race
<br>
without biological humans.  In that sense, the future doesn't need us,
<br>
because our mind children can do the job without us.
<br>
<p>But Joy never actually makes this point.
<br>
<p>What do you think the title means?
<br>
<p>Hal
