<p>Are you sure about that?  A friend of mine who lives in the Boston and is
<br>
studying this matter told me that it seems the IRS takes about eight years
<br>
on average to go after small time tax evaders.  If this is true -- and,
<br>
believe me, I hope it is not the case -- then you might think you're getting
<br>
away with it and whammo! they get you.

</em><br>
<p>I have my doubts, serious ones since you can wind up in prison or being
<br>
heavily fined for tax evasion.
<br>
<p>What is the name of this group?  Where can interested parties get in touch
<br>
with it?  And how much are the membership fees?
<br>
<p>Cheers!
