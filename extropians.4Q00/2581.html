<p>
ahhh extropians, a breath of fresh air.
<br>
<p>I've been watching this list for a few weeks now and have read most 
<br>
of the writings on extropy.com and feel sufficiently knowledgable about 
<br>
this paradigm to engage in intelligent discourse with this list.
<br>
<p>But oh, there is so much I wish to say, and get feedback on it simply 
<br>
would not be fitting to put it all in one post and expect you to read 
<br>
it all at once. And I feel that before getting started, I owe this list 
<br>
an introduction to myself, where I'm coming from and how I came 
<br>
to find the list.
<br>
<p>Please bear with me on this somewhat lengthy and admittedly self 
<br>
absorbed tour of myself.
<br>
<p>My childhood was one of poverty and constant struggle to simply 
<br>
survive, rather animalistic, if you will. I say this not in search 
<br>
of sympathy (ugh!) but simply as a description of where I am from.
<br>
I feel neither pride nor shame for this fact for it has in great part 
<br>
shaped who I am and given me an ability to find riches in the simplest 
<br>
of things and enjoy everything that life has to offer. I need no 
<br>
material to find happiness. I travel light and live as slave to noone, 
<br>
not money, for I know very well how to do without that, not authority, 
<br>
for I have no regard for authoritarians, and definately not to any 
<br>
paradigm, religion or group, for I am singular and believe nothing, 
<br>
except maybe possibility, for reality is rife with that.
<br>
I live my life by the tenet - 
<br>
A good person needs no laws to tell them to be good,
<br>
and a bad person will just break the laws anyway.
<br>
I think I fall well within the first half of that statement.
<br>
<p>At the young age of fourteen, I discovered LSD and would not be 
<br>
satisfied to simply open the doors of perception, but rather promptly 
<br>
proceeded to kick down every door which stood in the way of my 
<br>
realizations and plunder the knowledge which awaited behind each one 
<br>
be it joyous, revalatory, or horrifying. Though I no longer feel the need 
<br>
to use hallucinogens in this manner as I have gained all that I can from 
<br>
them (for now) my intense interest in retrospection and lack of fear of 
<br>
what I find within, has led me to a knowledge of myself at a level which 
<br>
i believe (haha, already a contradiction, there will be many more in my 
<br>
writings) very few people achieve in a lifetime.
<br>
<p>Around this same time, I became very immersed in the punk rock lifesyle 
<br>
and ideaology, finding myself to be contrary to everything I could find 
<br>
in society and full of anger for what I saw as an oppressive and 
<br>
repressive society, hell bent on forcing conformity and complacency 
<br>
through media manipulation of the mass conciusness, a machine which 
<br>
viewed me as raw material with which to construct another cog to do it's 
<br>
bidding. Nope, I wasn't biting. For a length of several years I saw it as 
<br>
my mission to disassemble this system the only way I could from my powerless
<br>
perspective - waste myself, if I could damage myself sufficiently that 
<br>
they would no longer see any use for me, and encourage other to do the same, 
<br>
then I was doing my part to take the system apart at the component level. 
<br>
So I dropped out after my third year in tenth grade and proceeded to 
<br>
cause mischief, mayhem and self destruction to an almost disgusting 
<br>
extreme.
<br>
I realize now that these attempts were greatly misconceived, but boy
<br>
what time it was.
<br>
<p>Seven years ago, against all that I believed, I almost joined the Navy, 
<br>
for the all the wrong reasons - a fealing of nihilistic desperation, not 
<br>
knowing where my life was going or why, lost and powerless and hungry
<br>
and having no skill with which to trade for livelihood. My familiy surely 
<br>
would have disapproved of this decision, so I kept it a secret for as long 
<br>
as I could. The ASVAB tests concluded that I would be best suited to a 
<br>
military vocation of Intelligence, I was going to be a spy for the 
<br>
government which I detested so much. My secret was let out of the bag when 
<br>
the recuiting officer called my house to get me in the office and sign my 
<br>
life away. My older brother answered the phone (I was out), and when I 
<br>
returned home he sat me down and convinced me to try just one other path in 
<br>
life before joining the military, if that failed he would leave me to my 
<br>
decision. After a little searching, I decided to go to a vocationial school 
<br>
for  computer programming, and so began a fascinating career in computer
<br>
technology and my love of the internet. Even though, I was determined not 
<br>
to fall into some dull, dreary, workaday existence of flourescent lights, 
<br>
cubicles and capitalistic drive for material wealth. I was in it for the 
<br>
experiences and the knowledge. (Ok, i enjoy blowing wads of cash on 
<br>
indulgences such as good food and liquor, a fun night out with friends, but 
<br>
I hold those memmories in higher value than the money I spend on them. 
<br>
All of my material belongings are purely functional, I own nothing simply 
<br>
for the sake of owning it). And my quest for interesting experiences has 
<br>
led me through myriad contracts with companies such as Electronic Arts, 
<br>
Larry Flynt Publications and Virtuality to name a few.
<br>
<p>Today, I would consider myself more of a contrarian than anything, as I 
<br>
find (unarmed) conflict to be one of the most creative forces in my 
<br>
experience and am always seeking a balance with the extremes.
<br>
<p>Of course I can't express fully who I am in this email, but I think that
<br>
is sufficient.
<br>
Thank you for taking the time to get to know me, I hope to know all of you 
<br>
better in time, and may we have many a heated discussion.
<br>
<p>Nate
<br>
<p><p>Keep an eye out for my future posts:
<br>
-  Why I'll never be a &quot;true&quot; extropian
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
-  A thesis on the paradox of nothing 
<br>
and
<br>
-  There is no box
<br>
<p><p>P.S.
<br>
Something I thought you extropians might be interested in...
<br>
I'm sure many of you are aware of the new development from 
<br>
ICANN regarding the seven new domain name suffixes - 
<br>
.aero, .biz, .coop, .info, .musuem, .name and .pro
<br>
Well, it occurred to me that the mere existance of these
<br>
has a great potential to cause a bull market the likes of which
<br>
noone has ever dreamed possible as they will undoubtedly
<br>
result in a massive number of computer sales and new 
<br>
companies which is almost certain to cause growth in every
<br>
aspect of the market. This coupled with the current (but temporary)
<br>
bear market makes this possibly the best moment in history
<br>
to invest in the stock market. But don't take my word for it.
<br>
I'm just a market watcher, not a player.
