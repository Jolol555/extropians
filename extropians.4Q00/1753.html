<p>Extropians are transhumans and do not differ from transhumans.  (A
<br>
transhuman is an evolution - a biological transition -  and not a
<br>
philosophy or an ideology.)  
<br>
Extropians can differ from other transhumanists by their goals and values.
<br>
<p>I can't find Max's response to Perry's post where he explains that
<br>
extropians are not by definition libertarians and he referred to the FAQ.
<br>
Perhaps he'll post it again.
<br>
<p>Anyway, it seems to me to more future oriented not to be affiliated with
<br>
any one party, but to focus on issues rather than leaders or political
<br>
parties.  In a world where everyone is constantly moving forward, it seems
<br>
silly to emphasize a political party rather than individual and global
<br>
values.  Even the libertarian party is not futuristic enough for those who
<br>
argue with strong government control.  What we need to do is to see beyond
<br>
parties and rally around the issues that will protect our interests and
<br>
provide venues for our endeavors.  The libertarian party may be forward
<br>
thinking on many fronts, but it lags behind in ideas about humanity (or
<br>
transhumanity, if you will) and this could be the reason why there is
<br>
resistance toward it.
<br>
<p>I'm not interested in political parties.  I'm interested in ideas and
<br>
gaining momentum.  To do this it is essential to work with others and to
<br>
develop an understanding of diverse perspectives.
