<p><em>&gt; Duh. Do you think I'm a monster?

<p>Nooo... You're the monster slayer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sure, but no matter what you do, a few of the bright babies wound up

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>And they would destroy AIs too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To show you all how truly evil I am, I propose for an early screening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program, identifying such people (thankfully, brilliant sickos are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite rare), and locking them up where they can't hurt themselves and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others.
</em><br>
<p>Do you have a preference as to the facility that will contain your &quot;truly evil&quot;
<br>
self?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sounds like a good plan. But people don't buy into delayed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gratification, so it has to work in small increments.
</em><br>
<p>Oh yeah, right. That explains why bankers rule the world. They just don't buy
<br>
into delayed gratification. And of course no one ever puts off gratifying their
<br>
desire to own a Mercedes until they finish medical school. That's why no one
<br>
ever finishes medical school.

<p><em>&gt; Our firmware is not made to cooperate in large groups, and deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extreme threats. We're not smart and rational enough for that. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there ever was a use for human germline engineering, it's to boost our
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Best argument I've read here in favor of developing AI which would result from
<br>
boosting human EQ and IQ.
