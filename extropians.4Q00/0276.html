<p><em> &gt; The seem to be utterly ignoring their models as offering any real insight
</em><br>
<em> &gt; into the possibility that economic output could rise to unheard of levels
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in the next few decades.  After all the charts and equations pointing
</em><br>
<p>You know, there's no magic in equations, forcing reality to fit the
<br>
plotted curve forever. Sooner or later the physical system passes out
<br>
of the regime where the equation did fit, and then you have to invent
<br>
another, better describing the total behaviour. Surely the moment,
<br>
where reality starts deviating from one model is noteworthy, but then,
<br>
it happens all the time.
<br>
<p>What we have now is something very far from sustainability, unless we
<br>
fix several things pretty damn quick. Still prevailing Carnot-cyclus
<br>
energy production is just plain barbaric, human-level automation only
<br>
exists as a potentiality at the horizont, so people remain the
<br>
bottleneck, we don't have cheap haul to LEO nor understand how to make
<br>
long-term stable life-support ecologies (heck, not even suits you can
<br>
decently work in), and hence no space culture at all, so there's not
<br>
even yet a place to expand to.
<br>
<p>Simultaneously, we have old industry countries petrifying in their age
<br>
demographics and political climate. This spells a conservative,
<br>
short-sightedly risk-averse reality perception, and set of strategies
<br>
to deal with it. We have a shift from vision driven people to money
<br>
and hedonism driven people, with the resulting slacking off in quality
<br>
of education in science and technology. A generation or two of the
<br>
kids are frankly going to the dogs. Regarding to science, there's a
<br>
dry spell in the memetical weather.
<br>
<p>Maybe that's me, but in face of a lots of forecasts going towards
<br>
infinity, this particular mix is not exactly healthy. In those 30-40
<br>
years until they hit the ceiling, we better get our collective asses
<br>
in gear, pronto, orelse these diamond castles in the sky will remain
<br>
only mirage, forever.
<br>
<p>I've been expecting massive research into nanotechnology to start in
<br>
early to mid 1980s. It has been two decades late in coming. Still not
<br>
quite at a funding level where I'd like it to see. We could have had
<br>
molecular electronics, right *now*. Fuel cell technology is nearly
<br>
three decades late in coming, and is still at least 5-10 years
<br>
away. In the year 2000, I'm very disappointed with AI/robotics, and
<br>
the state of computing in general. Space development is *extremely*
<br>
disappointing, and private efforts are right now well below threhold
<br>
at where it matters. Of all things, biological sciences including
<br>
gerontology are coming along nicely, much better than I've expected.
<br>
<p>Of course the doom-sayers are probably similiarly overzealous, so the
<br>
ceiling doesn't hang quite as low as advertised. But we sure as hell
<br>
need to change our attitude. Some heavy-duty PR is in order.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; towards something incredible happening, they continue to see the future
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in conventional terms.  What a letdown.
