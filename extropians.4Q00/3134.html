</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Especially if one can vary the reflectiveness of the sun-facing
<br>
surfaces, to reflect more in the side one wishes to accelerate away from
<br>
the center, and absorb more in the other side.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The star may have a magnetic field.  The field lines may extend out into

</em><br>
<em>&gt; sphere.  They may be conducted through the dyson sphere.  What is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sphere made of?  If it were made metallic and isotropic, would the star and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sphere be magnetically drawn together, or held stably concentric?  Could a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-isotropic or non-metallic sphere design take advantage of or circumvent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magnetic effects to passively achieve spherical concentricity?
</em><br>
<p>Modern technology, believe it or not.  The keywords you want are
<br>
&quot;intertially contained fusion&quot;: basically, keeping a plasma contained at
<br>
the center of a (spherical, usually) shell.  They're still working on
<br>
the &quot;fusion&quot; part, granted, but people have contained plasmas this way
<br>
before.  This would appear to be that, just on a much larger scale.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One last note.  Though the 800 lb gorilla appears neutral in this matter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's only first order effects.  Second order gravitational effects may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come into play.  If the non-uniform heating of one side of the sphere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causes it to distort, or tidal forces cause it to distort, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravitational forces may again come into play.  The devil's in the details.
</em><br>
<p>Even with an undistorted sphere, would the pull of gravity not be larger
<br>
on the point of the sphere closest to the star's center than on the
<br>
opposite point?  This would seem to be the biggest argument for keeping
<br>
the star centered (so there is no poin substantially closer to the
<br>
center).  Also, in practice, it may be desirable to support spheres with
<br>
non-uniform mass distribution - say, for docking large spaceships, or
<br>
for manufacturing, or for sentients residing in a similar fashion as
<br>
sentients on the surface of the Earth today (that is, clustering in
<br>
cities, migrating, et cetera) - though this may be best handled by
<br>
figuring the current center of mass and moving the star there with
<br>
respect to the sphere.
