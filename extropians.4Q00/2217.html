<em>&gt; More election news from inside Florida.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I reported yesterday that there was a 5 minute time limit for voting in Palm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beach County, a fact that I have not heard on the national news.  Today, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local news added a new bit of information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Poll workers today confirmed that people asking for help or asking for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second ballot were not given extensions on time.  People who took their time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allotment before asking for help were not allowed to vote because they ran
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of time.  People who took their time, voted, and then discovered that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their card was double-punched were not allowed to get a new ballot because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they had run out of time.  Many erroneous ballots were knowingly submitted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I wondered how people knew that they punched the wrong hole!)  Poll workers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say that about 20,000 ballots were discarded because they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; double-punched, and another 10,000 were discarded because the did not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either candidate punched.
</em><br>
<p><p>What?  This is outrageous.  The poll workers in California were
<br>
super-helpful.  Almost annoyingly so.  I have never heard of a 5 minute
<br>
time limit to vote.  If this is the case then we should go to internet
<br>
voting immediately.  That way we could make it uniform and let people
<br>
take their time.  The only limit is having a big enough channel and
<br>
large enough queues for the demand.  People can take all day playing
<br>
with the pages involved if they have their own computer or web tv.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This was legal under the time-limit rule which was approved by both parties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and lawfully applied.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another fun fact:  Write-in votes for Gore or Bush were not counted by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer.  If neither candidate was punched, the card was ignored.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apparently many people were so confused about which hole to punch, that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used the write-in slot instead.  These extra votes will appear during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; count by hand.  The count has already added about 800 more votes.  The hand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; count will add even more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can we trust any count if it changes every time?  Wouldn't we want the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; count to remain stable?
</em><br>
<p><p>I imagine there is no way to utterly stabilize it as the system was
<br>
relatively poorly designed and the results subject to some
<br>
interpretation in any case.  GIGO rules.
