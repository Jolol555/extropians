</em><br>
<p>Only if you are not decisive and do not know what is important to you. I could
<br>
probably make lots of money living in Silicon Valley. You couldn't get me to
<br>
live anywhere in California for a million bucks.

<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt;I personally find that more poor people move around far more frequently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than more affluent people, so your argument does not hold. Welfare people seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to find it quite easy to move from city to city and state to state to follow the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; best benefits, according to the data. U-HAUL and KOA are wonderful things. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could move my own household for $500-$1000 from coast to coast with little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trouble. People seem to excel at finding reasons to not do things far more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; finding reasons to do things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having been dirt poor once or twice in my long life I can assure you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that moving is no picnic when you haven't hardly (if at all) the money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for this month's rent plus groceries much less for first, last and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving costs.  The costs you list above is far beyond what can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afforded when you are really poor.  Welfare?  I was never eligible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one bureaucratic reason or another, not even when I was literally down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and out enough to be eating out of soup kitchens.  I was pretty dumb and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down and out in those long ago days but I wasn't a simple parasite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following the crumbs of welfare to the easiest pickings.
</em><br>
<p>Having been dirt poor myself once or twice, I realize the price I quoted is
<br>
higher than some could afford, it is what *I* could move coast to coast for
<br>
without selling off furniture or other posessions in my current household, but
<br>
those that would be that poor would likely find a bus ticket and/or just gas
<br>
money for their stuffed car to be more than sufficient.
<br>
<p>Currently we are seeing people whose Massachusetts welfare benefits have expired
<br>
are being told to move to NH, which has a limit of 5 years, though the benefits
<br>
are lower. These people would rather move to get lower benefits than go to work,
<br>
and they seem to be able to afford the move as well. If they put as much effort
<br>
into working as they do into not working, they could make a decent wage.
