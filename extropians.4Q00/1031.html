<em>&gt;     &gt; Question: What is the theoretical minimum yield you could get from a fusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; warhead using today's technology?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you're talking pure fusion warhead the answer is nobody knows, it could be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same as the maximum yield, zero.
</em><br>
<p>Huh? Zero?
<br>
Is it absolutely necessary to use a fission reaction to trigger a fusion
<br>
reaction, or are other means just not feasible for an easily deployable warhead?
<br>
I was reading about how shrimp have been discovered to produce 5000 degree
<br>
sonoluminescent bubbles with their claws via cavitation, and I am wondering how
<br>
much research has been done in using shaped charges or other acoustical focusing
<br>
methods to generate fusion reactions. If as you say, the mass defect is only 2
<br>
or 3 times greater, doesn't that mean you should be able to acheive such a
<br>
reaction with enough high explosives? How much more energy does the clean D-H3
<br>
reaction require over non-clean D-T reaction? Could it be possible to use a
<br>
small fission warhead to trigger a small D-T warhead to trigger a D-H3 reaction?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; The only problem would be using pony nukes that were clean.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even a pure fusion D-T bomb wouldn't be clean,  most of the energy goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into very high speed neutrons and that would turn everything near it into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radioactive isotopes. The neutrons also case structural weakness in materials so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the maintenance  on a D-T fusion reactor would be high. 
</em><br>
<p>OK. How easily does this radioactivity work its way through materials? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The greenest fusion reaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is between non radioactive deuterium (Hydrogen 2) and non radioactive Helium 3,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it produces non radioactive Helium 4 and an easily controlled positively charged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proton with 18.3 mev of energy. Its greatest virtue is that it produces no neutrons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately you need a higher temperature to achieve it than the deuterium tritium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction. Also, there is almost no Helium 3 on the Earth, although there is probably a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  lot of it that could be mined on comets and on the ice moons of the outer planets.
</em><br>
<p>I was under the impression that there was a lot of it in lunar regolith.
