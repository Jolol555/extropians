John Clark argued that &quot;The constitution says that the new president will be 
<br>
the man who receives a  majority of electors OFFICIALLY APPOINTED by December 
<br>
18. . . .  All Gore has to do is drag things out with lawsuits in the courts 
<br>
until December 18 and  then nobody would get Florida's 25 vote and Gore would 
<br>
be president.&quot;  For reasons I'll explain, I don't think John is quite right.  
<br>
I do think he raises an interesting question, though.
<br>
<p>Amendment. XII specifies that the president shall be *not* the candidate 
<br>
elected by a majority of *all possible* electoral votes but rather merely the 
<br>
candidate who gets &quot;the greatest number of votes for President, if such 
<br>
number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed . . . .&quot;  Thus 
<br>
the question: Could Gore's legal machinations delay the appointment of 
<br>
Florida's electors past some crucial date so as to allow him to prevail with 
<br>
the majority of the remaining delegates?  The Constitution does not specify a 
<br>
particular date on which electors shall be appointed.  Rather, art. II, s.1, 
<br>
cl. 3 provides that &quot;Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, 
<br>
and the Day on which they shall give their votes; which Day shall be the same 
<br>
throughout the United States.&quot;
<br>
<p>(An aside regarding the unconstitutionality of the entire election:  That the 
<br>
second &quot;Day&quot; in art. II, s. 1, cl. 3 speaks in the singular strongly implies 
<br>
that delegates must vote on the same day that the voters choose them.  To the 
<br>
contrary, however, under current practice voters choose delegates on the 
<br>
first Tuesday following the first Monday in November, 3 USCS s. 1 (2000), and 
<br>
delegates cast their votes on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in 
<br>
the December following the election, id. s. 3.  For the sake of the current 
<br>
discussion, however, let us charitably assume that the current practice 
<br>
passes constitutional muster.  We've got smaller fish to fry.)
<br>
<p>The question then turns on this: When is an elector &quot;appointed&quot; for the 
<br>
purposes of Amendment XII?  Note that art. I, s. 1, cl. 3 speaks solely of 
<br>
&quot;chusing&quot; electors.  If that equates to appointment, then it might well prove 
<br>
true that a state could by dint of an unresolved vote count fail to appoint 
<br>
electors by the December deadline.  In other words, Gore could by delaying 
<br>
the Florida outcome win on the votes of the remaining delegates.
<br>
<p>But if &quot;appointment&quot; means &quot;selection through some sort of state-level 
<br>
process--a reasonable interpretation, given that delegates are state 
<br>
officials--then a delay in resolving a state's vote would not leave delegates 
<br>
from other state's to decide the vote.  What would happen on this latter 
<br>
interpretation were Florida's delegates unable or unwilling to cast their 
<br>
votes by the specified deadline?  The passage from Article XII quoted above 
<br>
continues thus: &quot;and if no person have such a majority [of all appointed 
<br>
electors], then . . .&quot; the House shall choose the President.  In that event, 
<br>
no doubt, Gore would lose.
<br>
<p>I'll leave you with this last uncertainty: the just-cited provision clearly 
<br>
aims at resolving the problems raised by a vote split between three or more 
<br>
presidential candidates none of which has won more than 50% of the vote.  It 
<br>
does not at all seem designed to handle the problem I've described, that 
<br>
raised when less than a majority of electors split their votes between two 
<br>
candidates.  A constitutional crisis?  Well, a conundrum, at least.
