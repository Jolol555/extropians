This guy...
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.aful.org/pipermail/patents/2000-January/000286.html">http://www.aful.org/pipermail/patents/2000-January/000286.html</a>
<br>
<p>...has the craziest high tech business plan ever. He wants to search for
<br>
prior art on various companies' patents; short their stock or buy put options
<br>
on it; sue his victims to have their patents invalidated; laugh all the way
<br>
to the bank!
<br>
<p>Cruel, elegant, and ingenious. 
<br>
<p>The nice thing is, one doesn't even have to join his company. All one
<br>
would need to do is watch whom he's going after. If his theory proves 
<br>
correct with his first several victims, simply start copying his
<br>
investing behavior. If he becomes wildly successful, simply the fact
<br>
that he's suing a company should be enough to make their stock take 
<br>
a bath for a while, whether or not he wins.
<br>
<p>I originally sent this to a certain group of colleagues, but then I
<br>
realized that this guy's plan has a further-reaching significance so
<br>
I'm forwarding this to a broader audience. If frivolous patents benefit
<br>
the companies filing them at the expense of the common good, but now
<br>
lawyers can tear them to shreds and make a quick buck doing so, what
<br>
other instances of Tragedy of the Commons can this approach help solve
<br>
in a non-regulatory manner?
<br>
<p>What if somebody forms a law firm that files class action suits on
<br>
behalf of exploited workers? Or property owners in areas that are
<br>
suffering from illegal toxic dumping by companies? Or individuals who
<br>
were harrassed or discriminated against by a particular institution?
<br>
Heck, there already are organizations like that out there-- why are
<br>
most of them non-profits? Theoretically they should be rolling in the
<br>
dough from a cut of the settlements (and from shorting the stock of the
<br>
companies they are targetting, just like Aharonian is proposing to do).
<br>
What am I overlooking?
