<em>&gt; What if your Real SI has something analogous to Asperger's Syndrome, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you decide to go with it anyway? (Fatal Flaw scenario) What but an SI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can challenge its qualities? This is not a luddite question, it's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question about monocultures. Couldn't a deficient but effective SI still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present problems for the human race as a whole? This can be looked at as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another sort of labeling error, the grossest kind being &quot;insane SI&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labeled &quot;sane&quot;; I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtler. The SI runs its self-tests and says AOK. Great. How do mehums
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know it has its head screwed on straight?
</em><br>
<p>What if we have questions that only a Real SI can answer? Do we keep
<br>
derailing science with irrelevant distractions, or do we put our psychic
<br>
energy to use by supporting a Real SI. (Get Real scenario) Anyone can
<br>
challenge &quot;its qualities&quot; (whatever that might mean), by asking questions
<br>
that humans have not been able to answer (from Fermi's paradox to a Theory
<br>
Of Everything -- presently unanswerable questions abound). Neo-luddites can
<br>
form questions about monocultures as well as anyone, I guess. A second
<br>
Enlightenment entails shutting down pompous theologues, ideologues, and
<br>
demagogues with empirical science issuing from new convergence of nano-,
<br>
geno-, bio-, computatio-, neuro-, etc., hi-tech discovery which is happening
<br>
on a daily basis (read the hi-tech news items posted here). If it is a Real
<br>
SI, it has no &quot;deficiencies&quot; that a human can detect (if it has detectable
<br>
deficiencies, don't call it SI, call it DDAI, detectably deficient
<br>
artificial intelligence). If the deficiency is not detectable, then the
<br>
machine is way ahead of any human counterpart, because *every* human brain
<br>
has deficiencies of one sort or another. In any event, it will definitely
<br>
not present nearly the problem for the human race &quot;as a whole&quot; that
<br>
misguided opponents of SI present.
<br>
<p>Intelligence means the ability to solve problems, not the ability to present
<br>
problems. The human race &quot;as a whole&quot; has failed to provide evidence of its
<br>
sanity for the last three thousand years, in which time it has waged five
<br>
thousand wars (most of them &quot;holy&quot; wars. The Killer Ape is evidently a
<br>
congenital homicidal maniac. I have no idea what &quot;mehums&quot; need as far as a
<br>
warranty that SI &quot;has its head screwed on straight&quot; but responsible
<br>
scientists no doubt understand that considerably more scrutiny will be
<br>
applied to the sanity of SI than is currently applied to the millions of
<br>
humans who despite severe psychological problems continue to breed. If you
<br>
were sincerely concerned about the effects of insane intelligence on the
<br>
human race &quot;as a whole&quot; I don't believe you'd waste time philosophizing
<br>
about SI, you'd go to work for Zero Population Growth or Planned Parenthood,
<br>
or at least help to point out the insanity of organized religion.
<br>
<p>The strongest argument in favor of an Enlightenment singularity, as I
<br>
understand it, comes from cognitive and computational neurosciences, which
<br>
provide the foundation for building artificial brains. Artificial
<br>
intelligence will do for our brains what automotive technology has done for
<br>
our legs: Extend their power, amplify their function, enhance their purpose,
<br>
and improve the world in which we live and learn. Automobiles, despite some
<br>
clever essays by neo-luddites, do not actually rule our lives. Super
<br>
intelligence, because it is potentially far more powerful than cars, will
<br>
enhance human life even more than cars and trucks have. It's important to
<br>
remember that intelligence does not rule our society. If it did, we wouldn't
<br>
have gorons (sic) in government. What determines power and status, and
<br>
therefore authority and control in our social order (as a message from Greg
<br>
Burch helped me to understand) relates to the ability to establish social
<br>
connections and build confidence and trust in a professional network of team
<br>
members. Decisions are made by those in command, with help from advisors,
<br>
and often the advisors are smarter than commanders. Competent leaders are
<br>
those who have the emotional quotient to trust rather than to distrust high
<br>
intelligence, use it effectively, and make sane decisions with its help. No
<br>
mystery there.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>

&nbsp;I think I'd add &quot;free will&quot; to the list of &quot;consciousness&quot; &quot;phlogiston&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;vitalism&quot; and &quot;mind&quot; as examples of useless hypotheses.
