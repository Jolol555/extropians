It may work both ways. At least in my experience there were a lot of married
<br>
guys in the gay bars in the 60's and 70's.
<br>
<p>A lot of their wives gave them a &quot;boys night out&quot; and knew exactly what was
<br>
going on. In fact I met several of the wives.
<br>
<p>One reason for this is it allowed their husbands a little variety without
<br>
the risk that the guy would meet another woman which would threaten the
<br>
marriage. It might have also been a good reason to get them out of the house
<br>
for a few hours or not have them sitting around watching football and
<br>
drinking beer.
<br>
<p>One wife said it kept her husband in better shape for her as an out of shape
<br>
guy would have no luck in the bars.
<br>
<p>A lot of reasons are likely.
<br>
<p>Best Ralph
