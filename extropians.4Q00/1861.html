Robin writes, quoting Hal:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Another part of the paper that I disagree with is sections 4.2 and 4.3,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;on procrastination and addiction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;... discounting as typically understood cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be considered to play a significant role in these phenomena.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The problem is simply that the time frame is too short ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That paper is just referring to a large economic literature that does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to explain procrastination via non-exponential discounting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A common model is &quot;hyperbolic&quot; discounting.  If you could persuasively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show such models to be inconsistent with experiments, you could publish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that and win fame among economists.  So far such models do a reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; job of accounting for a wide range of otherwise puzzling phenomena.
</em><br>
<p>I will try to learn more about hyperbolic discounting.  One abstract I
<br>
found at <a href="http://www.opioids.com/abstract/discount.html">http://www.opioids.com/abstract/discount.html</a> generally supports
<br>
the hyperbolic model, but it closes with:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with previous findings, delayed heroin rewards were
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discounted at a significantly higher rate than were delayed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monetary rewards.
<br>
<p>This conforms to my observation that in order to explain addiction via
<br>
discounting, you must invoke a significantly higher discount rate than the
<br>
kind of rates I am familiar with from monetary markets.  My conclusion was
<br>
that discounting didn't fit, however I see now that another explanation
<br>
is to invoke different discount rates for different sources of happiness.
<br>
<p>Still, if people discount different pleasures by different amounts,
<br>
the model in the social discounting paper is incomplete at best.
<br>
