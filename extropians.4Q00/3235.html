<p>You lost me there, chief. I mean I can't dictate anything beyond whether
<br>
my own arms should reach out for another mouthful of popcorn, that sort
<br>
of thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Some people boggle to discover that many Plain Folk in Pennsylvania have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cell phones. This is because they think the Amish are luddites, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are not. They are, however, very selective about the technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they adopt. More power to that, say I.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I saw a documentary on PBS about the Amish. They don't let their kids go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond the eighth grade, because it might tempt them to discard literal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief in the Bible. (They believe the Earth is flat, because the Bible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentions &quot;the four corners of the Earth&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>I said Plain Folk, and then I said Amish. This was an attempt at noun
<br>
diversity. I am not sure all Plain Folk agree with both those points. In
<br>
any event (along the lines of the rather plonking adage that a stopped
<br>
clock is still right twice a day), I stand by my notion that picking the
<br>
technology you choose to adopt is a good thing, even if an occasional
<br>
Betamax or HDTV or Gene Z45678 doesn't get off the ground.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think secluded glens off the information superhighway are a fine idea,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even if some of them have razor wire around them. If you can keep 'em.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, those are very secure places. I think they're called &quot;prisons&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;penitentiaries&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I thought they were called &quot;Joe's Pick-N-Pay Wrecking&quot;. Watch out for
<br>
the dog.
