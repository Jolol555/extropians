Hi Steve.
<br>

<p><em>&gt; Truth, in this context, means a realistic assessment of our ability rather

</em><br>
<em>&gt; an outlook based optimism.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that we should make realistic assessments, but I suppose I'm trying
<br>
to be evocative of the somewhat more fluid actuality.  Our abilities are
<br>
often inextricably linked to our self-perception-- for instance, strangely,
<br>
my billiards game falls apart when I play my father.  The sort of
<br>
limitations I'm talking about removing have less to do with the physical
<br>
truth of our reality, and more to do with arbitrary limits we assign
<br>
ourselves for non-rational and emotional reasons.  The 'truth' of whether or
<br>
not I am capable of doing certain things is very often a function of, for
<br>
instance, my self-confidence.  This might be Yoda-esque, but I am no longer
<br>
'trying' to be successful, I have 'determined' to be successful.  In making
<br>
such a determination, I am choosing a greater truth for myself.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Am not sure &quot;talking to women&quot; is empowerment. Is visiting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prostitute *empowerment?* Isn't deliberating choosing NOT to talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also an empowerment ....an exercise of choice? Why not empower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joe by normalising his choice rather than by forcing him to act
</em><br>
differently?
<br>
<p>I'm not talking about forcing Joe to do anything... hey, if he doesn't want
<br>
to talk to someone, that's fine.  The far more common scenario that I'm
<br>
referencing however, is the case of an individual wanting to talk to other
<br>
people, but sabotaging their own efforts due to self-imposed doubt.  BTW,
<br>
I'm not suggesting the solution is trivial-- au contraire.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We may be acting on internal scripts learnt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from adults in childhood that were never properly analysed ....
</em><br>
<p>Yes!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Observe that there are people out there who operate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on another level-- who understand their empowerment-- who greedily embrace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you mean &quot;self-actualisation&quot; in the Rogerian sense?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, although from the comfort of my armchair, I've come at it from the
<br>
Maslow direction.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This is the sort of conversation I'd like to have in person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $50 an hour I'm afraid ..... (I jest, meet me for a drink if in Leeds).
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The whole point (I though) of this list was that participants are actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;trans-human&quot; going on &quot;post-human&quot; .....
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Again, this is my attempt to be ironic at your expense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just my normal conversation ... though I should remember that Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't handle irony very well, it's more of a British thing maybe.
</em><br>
<p>Who said I was American?  :)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Sorry, let me rephrase for clarity: &quot;can we imagine environments we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to imagine?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nightmares are a good example of this.
</em><br>
<p>Good example.
