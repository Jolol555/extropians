</em><br>
<p>I only adopted that view for the purposes of discussion.  In fact, as
<br>
you may recall, I'm a complete anti-realist about &quot;experiences&quot;
<br>
generally.  I believe that we can and should reinterpret claims about
<br>
consciousness and qualia as claims about non-mental entities, because
<br>
the mental entities aren't &quot;really&quot; there, much like &quot;the creeps.&quot;
<br>
<p>I had a different point to make in that post, however, so I adopted
<br>
epiphenomenalism as a useful starting point.  My point was that no
<br>
scientific theory can be given about how we have consciousness.
<br>
<p>Granted, if one is anti-realist about consciousness, this falls out in
<br>
one step: it's hard to have a good explanation for the existence of
<br>
stuff that's not really there.  (But darned if Steve won't try!)  But
<br>
the point is that even if I'm an epiphenomenalist, I have the same
<br>
problem.  I'm not sure, but John Clark may be an epiphenomenalist (as
<br>
described above) as well; I know he has said in the past that no
<br>
theory of consciousness can be defended scientifically.
<br>
<p>As for you, Eliezer, I know you think that experiences affect the
<br>
physical world (so we can, in principle, discover this
<br>
scientifically).  But I doubt that you're right about that.  If you're
<br>
not, then I think one has to fall back on epiphenomenalism or mental
<br>
anti-realism.
<br>
<p>Steve believes that non-physical things can't interact with physical
<br>
things.  If I argue successfully that he ought to be an
<br>
epiphenomenalist if he is to believe in experiences at all, then I can
<br>
show that he's got to give up MVT as a theory of consciousness (though
<br>
not as a theory of conscious-like behavior).
