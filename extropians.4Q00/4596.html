<br>
<em>&gt; Why did you use the math department as an example of empirical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research?
</em><br>
<p>I tried to deduce why you think that I used the math department as an
<br>
example of empirical research, but I failed. I did not use the math
<br>
department as an example of empirical research. Then I remembered that it
<br>
doesn't really matter why.
<br>
How is the math department used in the Edelman story? It is used as an
<br>
example of a discipline which functions between the careful observation,
<br>
empirical experimentation, and hands on experience of science in contrast
<br>
to the methods of philosophy, methods which have failed for thousands of
<br>
years to disprove the bugaboos of religionism. As I envision the big
<br>
picture here, science relates to philosophy as a medicinal drug relates to
<br>
a panacea. Math is trangulated somewhere outside them both.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you condemn logic, scientific method, theories, proofs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peer-review, extrapolation and imagination when you condemn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy?  Or do you exclude these from that realm when you condemn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all philosophy?  If so, you may be condemning the parts of philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I disdain while retaining the parts that I value.  That is, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may agree on our choices, and merely classify them with different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labels.
</em><br>
<p>I'd exclude the scientific method from philosophy because the scientific
<br>
method requires hardware: empirical experimentation, direct observation,
<br>
physical measurement (which includes math), and philosophy does not
<br>
require these ties to reality to do its stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it still Thesius' ship?  There is no right answer.  The label of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Thesius' ship&quot; denotes an ownership relationship that is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empirically provable.  The concept of ownership is philosophical.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists, not in reality or by science.  It exists by cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreement, by legal agreement, by linguistic terminology, or by other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference systems that we use for interaction between humans.
</em><br>
<p>An ownership relationship is empirically provable in the State of
<br>
California, I don't know about other States or other nations. In
<br>
California ownership is established with a tangible instrument called a
<br>
deed or a bill of sale. Even philosophers can own property in California,
<br>
but they must have a deed or a bill of sale to prove it, just like
<br>
everyone else.
<br>
<p>Regardless of how you define ownership, unless you fundamentally change
<br>
the elements of that definition by exchanging the atoms of the property in
<br>
question, the original ownership relationship remains intact. So, I hold
<br>
with my conclusion that the reconstructed ship belongs to Thesius. Those
<br>
who claim ownership to Thesius' ship will do well to avoid resorting to
<br>
philosophy to prove their claim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In law, for instance, we would have to determine what the contractual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreement was for the workers to do all this work, and what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreed to return to Thesius.  In all probability, the rebuilt ship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was returned to Thesius as his property and the rotting ship was left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the workers as spare parts.  Can this be empirically measured?
</em><br>
<p>Can the probability be measured? No, because it is only a philosophical
<br>
probability about a hypothetical ship. If the ship were real, then yes, it
<br>
could be measured empirically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No.  Is there a chemical test we can perform, such as DNA matching,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see which is Thesius' ship?
</em><br>
<p>This seems rather far afield. We don't need to test the ship to see if it
<br>
is Thesius' ship if we were paying attention to the narrative. According
<br>
to the story, Thesius' ship got all its rotten material replaced with
<br>
fresh material. So, Thesius has a fresh ship. DNA testing is irrelevant.
<br>
No quandary there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No.  The question of nomenclature is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely a linguistic reference system that we use for communications.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question of ownership cannot be measured by science.
</em><br>
<p>I think it can be measured by science. If the ships in question were real,
<br>
science could quite easily ascertain the correct ownership. Whether those
<br>
involved accept a scientific determination is another matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logically deduced by linguists, lawyers, judges, and psychologists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whatever we end up deciding becomes the right answer.  There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective measurable ownership particles that will lead us to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right answer.
</em><br>
<p>I think linguists, lawyers, judges, and psychologists will continue to
<br>
justify their jobs in concrete terms, rather than rely on philosophy. As I
<br>
wouldn't trust shysters who advance their careers on the basis of their
<br>
religious connections, so I wouldn't trust those who prosper as a result
<br>
of their philosophical connections.
<br>
<p>But this isn't really about Thesius and his imaginary ship. It's about
<br>
uploading and copying humans. To accomplish that will require science, not
<br>
philosophy.

<em>&gt; (Actually, pancritical rationalism in some sense makes scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foundations at somewhat empirical, but you still have to do some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical thinking there)
</em><br>
<p>Well, you may have to do some rational thinking, but that doesn't mean you
<br>
have to get philosophical to do it.

<br>
<em>&gt; Yes, you're exactly right about the answer. The reason it is the wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question though, is because the person giving this talk, when members of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; audience made the point that you just made, would respond with something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like &quot;yes, but which one is *really* Thesius's ship?&quot;, this is the wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question but he thought it made sense. He was implicitly subscribing to
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; belief known as &quot;essentialism&quot;, that there is something about this ship
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; give it its &quot;Thesius's ship&quot;-ness as an object, something which is
</em><br>
separate
<br>
<em>&gt; from any cultural considerations.
</em><br>
<p>I think it can be shown that the reconstructed ship is Thesius' ship
<br>
(separate from any cultural considerations), with no recourse to
<br>
philosophy. Simply keep an accurate record (one of several scientific
<br>
techniques) of the stated intentions of those who cause the reconstruction
<br>
of Thesius' ship. If their intention is for the reconstructed ship to
<br>
remain Thesius' ship, then we have empirical evidence in this record of
<br>
their intent.

<br>
<em>&gt; Philosophies vary a lot too.  One shouldn't assume that all of them are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equal or as useful or as valid.  In this vein, it's my belief that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy's purpose, against which it can't be measured, is to help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals to live life.  So in a sense, it should be for the good,
</em><br>
though
<br>
<em>&gt; there is a lot of difference between different people and different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical systems over what is good.
</em><br>
<p>I'll drink to that, and add that whatever values we use to make the kind
<br>
of philosophy you describe good, can be used to make science better.

&quot;It's time people stopped taking Rand at her word and start looking at her
<br>
ideas, examining them dispassionately to see where they lead - rather than
<br>
just accepting what she and some of her followers tell us about them.
<br>
This, of course, is the method one should use when examining any person's
<br>
beliefs or any set of ideas. Anything less is an abdication of judgment.&quot;
<br>
<p>I think if she had the patience, Rand could have done some real science.
<br>
But then, it's more profitable to work the system (as the power companies
<br>
demonstrate) than to create something truly useful. Who knows, perhaps
<br>
Rand used the scientific method to determine that she'd do better as a
<br>
fiction writer than as a scientist.

<em>&gt; Yes, I think Philosophy can be covered in kindergarten! I do accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;History of Philosophy&quot; as a valid academic category. But &quot;critical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking skills&quot; should be hived off to debating societies and rhetoric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; study on the one hand, and something like speed-Shogi  to improve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem solving, strategic ability and mental alertness on the other.
</em><br>
<p>All right! Thank you for this excellent suggestion. Those religions and
<br>
philosophies are best, IMNSFHO, which get out of the way of science the
<br>
quickest.

<em>&gt; Beyond this, studying philosophy as part of an analysis of history
</em><br>
yields a
<br>
<em>&gt; vital understanding of the importance of ideas and the role that they
</em><br>
play in
<br>
<em>&gt; society, as well as the influence that events &quot;in the world&quot; have on
</em><br>
ideas.
<br>
<em>&gt; The former bestows on the student a sense of the importance of &quot;big
</em><br>
ideas&quot;,
<br>
<em>&gt; while the latter helps to cultivate a strong sense of skepticism and the
</em><br>
deep
<br>
<em>&gt; interconnectedness of life and the world.
</em><br>
<p>Yes indeed, the benefits of studying philosophy far outweigh the benefits
<br>
of doing philosophy.
