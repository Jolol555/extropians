From: &quot;Eugene Leitl&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:eugene.leitl@lrz.uni-muenchen.de?Subject=Re:%20Fermi%20Paradox%20in%20the%20news&In-Reply-To=&lt;00a401c03d56$8e48ee80$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">eugene.leitl@lrz.uni-muenchen.de</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Any rational individual must be aware of the fact that we live in place
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; where matter, under certain circumstances, self organizes into a state
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; intelligence.  Rational and -curious- people will begin to inquire as
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; what those circumstances are, and whether they exist elsewhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, but what has this to do with the issue at hand?
</em><br>
<p>Everything.  We have an example.  We have a single data point.  To the
<br>
question: &quot;Does intelligence emerge as a result of the nature of the
<br>
universe?&quot; we can answer yes.  (Unless you believe in a 'Creator.'  Er,
<br>
nope, actually, even then.)
<br>
<p>Does this mean that there is necessarily intelligent life elsewhere in the
<br>
universe?  No.  It doesn't.  If we discover one other intelligence, does
<br>
this mean that there is necessarily more than two intelligences in the
<br>
universe?  No.  It doesn't.  It is an observation that gives us insight into
<br>
what's going on 'out there' and leads us to make predictive statements.
<br>
Theory my man, theory.  Assumptions in the face of limited knowledge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In absence of other data points our existence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence for our existence, and nothing beyond that. (Ok, I promise to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lay off bad acid for the future).
</em><br>
<p>No, actually, our existence is *proof* of our existence and *evidence* of
<br>
other intelligent existence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; show that the events that occurred on earth could not possibly be
</em><br>
replicated
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; elsewhere...?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Principia non sunt. Burden of proof. (=You lose).
</em><br>
<p>Come now, you know that doesn't work here.  You don't have to observe each
<br>
and every instance of a particular event before you can begin to make
<br>
predictive statements.  Or, to be more clear: do -you- hold the belief that
<br>
the events that occurred on Earth could not possibly be replicated
<br>
elsewhere?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In absence of further data, the simplest explanation to Fermi's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradoxon is that we're not in anybody smart/powerful light cone.
</em><br>
<p>Is the simplest explanation the most likely explanation when the subject is
<br>
necessarily complicated? (i.e. Far more intelligent than us.)  Do you
<br>
believe that future terrestrial intelligences will be understood by current
<br>
terrestrial intelligence in a meaningful and simple way?
<br>
<p>I think you believe, as I, that the arrow of intelligence approaches a
<br>
singularity.  There is great mystery left in the way the universe works.
<br>
Who knows what level of reality -we- will inhabit when we punch through.
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;I
<br>
<em>&gt; would like to amplify that by stating that we would not be holding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this discussion if it was any different. Double anthropic principle.
</em><br>
<p>The anthropic principle does not protect your argument, because it actually
<br>
says very little about reality.  Can I use a veto on this argument, or do we
<br>
really have to spiral off in this direction?  Your call I guess.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Can't we, Doug, at the very least, attach probabilities to the
</em><br>
likelihood of
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; intelligence spontaneously arising at other spatial coordinates in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; existence matrix?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not in good faith, since our planetary accretion models nor our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steriliztion-catastrophe models nor our evolutionary kinetics models
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are validated, and we don't have very-large-baseline interferometry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and very-large-aperture spectroscopy instruments to gather data points
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on remote planet composition, size and orbit distribution/stability at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least in our stellar neighbourhood.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We Need More Data.
</em><br>
<p>Is the discovery of a single neutrino enough data to speculate the existence
<br>
of 'more than one' neutrino?
