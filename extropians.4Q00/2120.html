The only problem with this is lawsuits. Given the fact that I don't like the
<br>
government, shutting it down isn't so bad, but there are people who depend on
<br>
government services (especially in areas where the government has made itself
<br>
the only provider), so this is the issue: Anyone who doesn't like the results of
<br>
the election just files a lawsuit accusing someone of fraud, then find a judge
<br>
who'll agree to it. Election stopped, time wasted figuring things out.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as one person does it, it'll happen ALL the time. Knowing that, no
<br>
politician is going to fail to use that to keep this from happening. I don't
<br>
think it matters how much data there is that this is secure; it isn't a science
<br>
issue, it's law, the same as the silicon breast-implant issue.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You probably also need a way to make sure that your vote isn't altered once
<br>
it enters the public stream, though I suspect the proper public-key encryption
<br>
would prevent this, though again it lends itself to a lawsuit.  Since large
<br>
numbers of people won't understand this, putting them on a jury is going to be
<br>
fun. (Like the trials which use DNA)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, with proper encryption, we don't need representatives (something I
<br>
think a holdover from when only land-owners could vote, and communications were
<br>
incredibly slow.) And that's why it'll be a long time before this kind of
<br>
technology will be implemented. (Isn't that sad, too, how often technology
<br>
exists but politics prevents its use?)

<p><em>&gt;No, it's not my Chicagoan blood showing through.  It's just that I feel that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Better yet would be if the cryptomagic folks come up with a way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;double-blind the votes, as with some of the proposals that have been floated
</em><br>
