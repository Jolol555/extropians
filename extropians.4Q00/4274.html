<br>
<p>A MUSICAL ODYSSEY
<br>
<p>Issue Ten:
<br>
<p>A long strange trip through the music collection of Dirk Douglas.
<br>
<p>Ayn Rand claimed that our philosophical premises,conscious and subconscious,
<br>
give rise to our aesthetic preferences.  If anecdotal accounts are to be
<br>
trusted, she went so far as to judge others on little more than artistic
<br>
evidence:  So-and-so likes Beethoven-therefore he has a malevolent sense of
<br>
life - therefore he is not my kind of person.
<br>
<p>I share Rand's moderate, &quot;official&quot; position, but not the extreme version
<br>
she appears to have held in private. Against Rand's private view one thing
<br>
that can be said is that Rand seems not to have considered the possibility
<br>
that multiple premises might lead to the same taste, or that the same one
<br>
premise might be expressed in multiple tastes.  Instead of regarding
<br>
artistic taste as an unequivocal symptom of an unambiguous spiritual
<br>
condition, I regard it as more of a magnifying glass; it delivers no occult
<br>
knowledge, but it can help you see something you are already familiar with a
<br>
lot better.
<br>
<p>An opportunity recently arose for me to put the Randian theory to the test.
<br>
A few months ago I was given the entire CD collection of a man named Dirk
<br>
Douglas, a musician of my acquaintance who died unexpectedly in June  I
<br>
don't think he'd mind if I spoke frankly, even bluntly, about the lessons I
<br>
have learned from studying his collection:  I knew Dirk for many years, and
<br>
candor was one of his highest values.
<br>
<p>Dirk had surprisingly narrow affinities. At least 75% of his collection,
<br>
which numbered 72 discs, came from the 1970s or from bands whose heyday was
<br>
in the 70s.  He had five or six albums each by Kansas and Yes as well as
<br>
greatest hits albums by Foreigner, Starship and the like.  He also had a few
<br>
greatest hits discs from early 80s performers like Mr Mister and Kenny
<br>
Loggins who were essentially holdovers from the 70s.  He had almost no
<br>
classic 60s rock - an album of Blood, Sweat and Tears from his own
<br>
brass-band days was about it.  He did have a few more recent discs:  one by
<br>
Tori Amos, one by Joan Osborne.  He also had several upbeat white gospel
<br>
albums of recent vintage, presumably acquired during the last few years of
<br>
his life when his health was poor and he once again turned to Christianity.
<br>
<p>There were a few classical and jazz items.  Dirk's mother, I know, was a big
<br>
fan of Chopin and encouraged Dirk's piano playing.  (Dirk was a keyboard
<br>
player, singer and arranger.)  So there was a disc of Chopin performed by
<br>
Vladimir Horowitz, a soundtrack from the movie &quot;Shine&quot; and one or two cheesy
<br>
&quot;Great Classical Piano Works&quot; compilations.  The principle behind his jazz
<br>
collection I cannot discern, but he did have the good taste to like classic
<br>
jazz like Miles Davis' &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; and not modern anti-jazz like Kenny G.
<br>
<p>It is obvious that Dirk favored keyboards, but he also favored vocal
<br>
harmonies.  He had a couple of CDs he'd burned himself featuring songs with
<br>
tight harmonies, including one song by the Carpenters, a group he would have
<br>
little to do with otherwise.  He had greatest hits albums by Queen and
<br>
Earth, Wind and Fire (among the rare black performers in Dirk's catalogue).
<br>
Dirk himself had a good, versatile voice, and was not only very proud of his
<br>
harmonizing but was also a connoisseur of other people's.  I remember him
<br>
almost 25 years ago explaining to me how the Wilson brothers of the Beach
<br>
Boys and Freddie Mercury of Queen worked their miracles.
<br>
<p>It should be clear that Dirk's musical taste followed his professional
<br>
interests with regard to the technical dimension. I suspect this is a common
<br>
correlation among musicians. But there are plenty of musical acts that
<br>
employ keyboards and/or tight vocals.  Why did Dirk pick the ones he did?
<br>
<p>Dirk started trying to make it as a pro when he was 17,in 1972.  He only
<br>
attended a community college and that only for a year or two.  Despite his
<br>
impressive intelligence, his formal education in music and everything else
<br>
ended in the middle 70s.  The 70s was Dirk's era:  he liked the questioning
<br>
of authority, the sexual freedom, the flamboyance of attire and hairstyle
<br>
and the drugs.
<br>
<p>It is my belief that Dirk was so at home in this era that he simply stopped
<br>
growing when it ended.  It's common for a person's tastes (and beliefs) stop
<br>
developing once they surpass college age, especially if drugs are a part of
<br>
their life.  Dirk ceased being of college age around 1977.  To be sure, he
<br>
did still follow trends after 1977, but not ones that *started* after 1977.
<br>
And this means that he missed out on punk and new wave.  Whatever you want
<br>
to say about punk, it did clean out the system of its self-indulgent
<br>
excesses and made it possible for something ironic and worldly-wise to grow.
<br>
But there was nothing like the Clash, Elvis Costello or even Squeeze in
<br>
Dirk's collection.
<br>
<p>And Dirk's limited taste was reflected in the music he wrote and performed
<br>
too.  The boy was simply lost in the 70s and that fact along with his
<br>
personality and health problems no doubt accounts for his failure to make it
<br>
as a musician.
<br>
<p>But even this biographical analysis does not peg Dirk and his tastes.  If he
<br>
was so in love with the 70s why didn't he own any Eagles or ELO?  Perhaps
<br>
the technical criteria would knock out some of the great bands of the era,
<br>
but not all.  Here we need to appeal
<br>
to Dirk's sense of life and psycho-epistemology.  Let me try to weave an
<br>
image of Dirk with the music he owned as the warp and my personal
<br>
recollections as the woof.
<br>
<p>The groups most represented in his collection were Yes and Kansas.  What
<br>
they have in common, other than the obvious, is that both use keyboards as
<br>
their foundation, both are &quot;hyper&quot; or strident in their pacing and emotional
<br>
tone, both have pretensions to the
<br>
&quot;lyrical.&quot;  The main point of difference is that Yes is more impersonal and
<br>
arty where Kansas is more intimate and &quot;sincere.&quot;
<br>
<p>Interestingly, if I had to pick a band that represented a synthesis of Yes
<br>
and Kansas, I would choose Rush. Yet Dirk didn't own any Rush and never said
<br>
a word to me about them.  Dirk was no Objectivist, and his libertarianism,
<br>
if we may loosely call it that, was purely of the &quot;Defy authority - do
<br>
drugs&quot; variety.  More importantly, Rush stylistically as well as
<br>
philosophically dedicated itself to reason:  they were always crystal clear
<br>
and they never encouraged self-indulgence of an emotionalistic kind.   In
<br>
this way, they were light-years away from Yes and Kansas.  (And no, I do not
<br>
like Rush.  But we can talk about that another time.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From knowing him, I would say that the decisive element shared by most of
</em><br>
the bands in Dirk's collection was &quot;sincerity.&quot; Dirk hit his teens in the
<br>
late 60s and while he was not a &quot;60s person,&quot; he was one of that era's many
<br>
heirs.  Those of you old enough to remember the 70s or who have studied it
<br>
have surely gleaned that one of its key concepts was &quot;the natural.&quot; Partly
<br>
this was due to the ecology movement, and partly it was due to the 1960s
<br>
rejection of process in favor of immediate, &quot;authentic&quot; action, experience
<br>
and emotion.  Put these two influences together and you get a worship of
<br>
human nature conceived of as bodily functions and spontaneous feelings.
<br>
According to this &quot;code of the natural,&quot; either you acknowledged those
<br>
functions and feelings or you  futilely tried to deny them.  Dirk's attitude
<br>
towards what was &quot;natural&quot; ranged from the matter-of-fact to outright
<br>
wallowing. In short, if Dirk had an itch he would scratch it -sometimes in
<br>
public.
<br>
<p>Lest I sound one-sidedly critical of Dirk's &quot;naturalism,&quot; let me say that it
<br>
made him a frank and open person, bolstered his sense of humor (because it
<br>
helped him puncture people's pretensions) and contributed to his largely
<br>
healthy pro-sex attitudes.  That having been said, I hope it's obvious that
<br>
I do not take Dirk's beliefs at face value - and that I do not blame him for
<br>
the errors of an entire generation.
<br>
<p>The attitude of &quot;sincerity&quot; and &quot;naturalness&quot; are clearly reflected in
<br>
Dirk's music.  As I write, I am listening to his copy of  &quot;Starship:
<br>
Greatest Hits (Ten Years and Change 1979-1991).&quot;  For those of you who don't
<br>
know, Starship was the successor group to Jefferson Starship, which was in
<br>
turn the successor to Jefferson Airplane.  Each successor represents a
<br>
diminution of its predecessor.  The original Airplane was a band of
<br>
undisciplined geniuses fronted by two amazing vocalists, Grace Slick and
<br>
Marty Balin.  Starship was fronted by a third-generation clone of Marty
<br>
Balin, an histrionic little man named Mickey Thomas, with Grace Slick as
<br>
little more than a back-up vocalist.
<br>
<p>If Starship has one salient quality, it's a loudly-proclaimed earnestness.
<br>
With his trademark wail, Thomas squeezes every ounce of feeling out of songs
<br>
like &quot;Jane,&quot; &quot;Sara&quot; and &quot;Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now,&quot; the last of which,
<br>
improbably, seems to be intended as a wedding anthem for the trailer set.
<br>
Now I could see a completist fan of the Airplane in all its incarnations
<br>
buying such a disc, but Dirk didn't own anything by Jefferson Airplane or
<br>
Jefferson Starship. He headed straight for the trough of emotion that is
<br>
just plain Starship.  This album is a particularly clear magnifying glass of
<br>
Dirk's values.
<br>
<p>With the concept of &quot;sincerity&quot; we have a pretty good hold on Dirk's ethos
<br>
(sense of life or metaphysical value judgments), but what about his
<br>
psycho-epistemology?  This is somewhat harder to identify, but again his
<br>
music can be of assistance, especially a group like Yes.
<br>
<p>What distinguishes Yes is its motoric, almost impersonal drive and
<br>
complexity.  I don't think it's the impersonality as such that attracted
<br>
Dirk, since most of his collection was anything but impersonal.  Rather it
<br>
would seem to be the machine-like drive and the complexity.  (Think of the
<br>
paradigmatic Yes song &quot;Roundabout.&quot;)  These qualities are shared by Kansas
<br>
(think of the relentlessness and the Bach-like piano of &quot;Carry On Our Native
<br>
Son&quot;).  Starship and some of Dirk's other discs also share them to a lesser
<br>
degree.
<br>
<p>There are three reasons why Dirk and the strident style were made for each
<br>
other.  First is that naturalism in the 70s frequently took an assertive,
<br>
theatrical cast. (Dirk was largely indifferent to &quot;mellow&quot; groups like
<br>
Bread.)
<br>
<p>Second is Dirk's personality.  Dirk was clinically hyperactive and
<br>
congenitally melodramatic.  Truth be told, when Dirk was &quot;up&quot; it was
<br>
difficult to share a room with him.
<br>
<p>Third and most relevant is a more specifically psycho-
<br>
epistemological factor.  Dirk loved fast, driving, complex, prestidigitation
<br>
in music.  I call this esthetic complex &quot;razzmatazz.:&quot;  I chose the
<br>
colloquial name because it seems to capture exactly what Dirk loved about
<br>
the music in question:  its ability to impress by attracting the listener's
<br>
attention and then almost losing it along the way, like a game of three-card
<br>
monty.  Razzmatazz represents the energy and enthusiasm Dirk loved and had
<br>
in his own life.  (And Dirk would have liked it that I chose a colloquial
<br>
term, since he generally believed that a technical or orderly approach to a
<br>
subject was mere pomposity.)
<br>
<p>Razzmatazz may help explain why Dirk gravitated toward synthesizers and the
<br>
like when he was also proficient on piano, guitar, drums and brass
<br>
instruments:  the gee-whiz, high-tech factor appealed to the fast-talking
<br>
showman in him.
<br>
<p>I suppose we could say that a composer like Bach displayed razzmatazz too,
<br>
but that doesn't seem right, does it?  Bach was reflecting his view of a
<br>
complex, orderly universe.  Razzmatazz, although it surely reflected Dirk's
<br>
ability quickly to take up information and to deal with multiple channels at
<br>
the same time, seems more to have been about Dirk than about a view of
<br>
reality.
<br>
<p>In loving Yes or Kansas or Kenny Loggins, what Dirk loved was his own
<br>
feeling that he could bop through the world getting by on his sense of life.
<br>
His love of complexity was not primarily about the adoration of some
<br>
crystalline aspect of the world; it was always about asserting his own
<br>
personality.  He was trying to impress, and the person he sought most to
<br>
impress was himself.
<br>
<p>The history of Dirk's belief structure confirms this analysis:  Throughout
<br>
his various ideological phases, whether he was a born-again Christian, a
<br>
free-flowing mystic, or a semi-rational student of psychology (a la
<br>
Meyers-Briggs), behind it all was always Dirk, the prodigy whose smarts and
<br>
intuition could discern the truth and deal with it, not by submission to
<br>
something external (like reality or God), but by sheer panache.
<br>
<p>Now we are able to integrate what we know about Dirk's music with what we
<br>
know about Dirk.  The linchpin is an intelligent yet rigid subjectivism.
<br>
Dirk had a concept of feelings as the ultimate authority and of conjuring
<br>
the right &quot;groove&quot; as the proper method for success.  For him style, or what
<br>
I call pseudo sense of life, was everything.
<br>
<p>And thus it was he failed.  Not in a glorious battle with the forces of
<br>
mediocrity and conformity that he loved to fight, but in sad loneliness.
<br>
Botched back surgery and a low tolerance for pain (no doubt exacerbated by
<br>
decades of drug abuse) led him to incapacity and to dependence on
<br>
prescription medicine.  The last and most pathetic in a long series of
<br>
damaged women whom he both financially exploited and emotionally bolstered
<br>
had died.  His father, who had helped get him on public assistance and
<br>
provided some emotional sustenance when he was crippled, had died.  Most
<br>
importantly, even Dirk could surely see that finally his
<br>
dreams had died.
<br>
<p>One morning in June of 2000, the nurse who helped Dirk with his morphine
<br>
patches found him dead.  He had six of the patches on him and over 100
<br>
barbiturate tablets in him.  Whether as his friends believe, it was an
<br>
accidental overdose with pill after pill being taken in a daze, or, as his
<br>
family believes, it was a suicide, will never be determined with certainty.
<br>
There was no note.
<br>
<p>I don't admire subjectivism, and I know it doesn't work.  But I do have to
<br>
respect Dirk, subjectivism and all.  Misguided and crazy as he was his whole
<br>
life, he did have a dream and he did pursue it.  I am reminded of a song
<br>
from Dirk's collection, perhaps not so atypical as it first may appear to
<br>
be:  &quot;Deacon Blues&quot; by Steely Dan.  The song tells the mythic tale of a
<br>
young man who goes from being a &quot;nobody&quot; to being a jazz musician, very much
<br>
a part of &quot;the life.&quot;  The refrain goes:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned to work the saxophone.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I play just what I feel.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink scotch whiskey all night long
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and die behind the wheel.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They got a name for the winners in the world.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want a name when I lose.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They call Alabama the Crimson Tide.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call me Deacon Blues.
<br>
<p>I've always loved the twisted perseverance and authenticity of that song,
<br>
and I guess that's how it was possible for me to love Dirk.
<br>
<p>So it appears that Ayn Rand was right, that your personality does determine
<br>
your musical choices, and one can use your musical tastes to get a handle on
<br>
your premises.
<br>
<p>But Ayn Rand was wrong on another subject: : not all values are chosen
<br>
values and not all scars on one's view of existence can be avoided.  Here I
<br>
am referring to myself.  Dirk's life and death have a greater hold on me
<br>
than I would ever choose to give them. For you see, &quot;Dirk Douglas&quot; was a
<br>
stage name which Dirk took as his legal name a decade ago.  His given name
<br>
was Dirk Douglas Keefner, and he was my brother.  Perhaps I understand his
<br>
brilliance and his madness because they are partly mine as well.  For the
<br>
rest of my life Dirk will have the power to tear me in two, as I laud his
<br>
intelligence, talent and decency, loathe his self-indulgence and blind spots
<br>
and lament his mental illness. No matter how I agonize over his memory,
<br>
however, I will always be grateful to him for helping to kindle the love of
<br>
music in me.  It is a gift which can never die.
<br>
<p>Now forgive me, gentle reader, for the deception of not revealing my true
<br>
relation to Dirk sooner.  The only way I could stand to write about him and
<br>
the only way I could trust others to think about what I had to say about
<br>
him, was by making the subject seem impersonal.  Dirk would have enjoyed the
<br>
gag.
