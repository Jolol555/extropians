<p>Actually, &quot;you&quot; are there.  Or whatever you and others of your kind
<br>
become.  The decision will be up to us at some point.  And seeing it
<br>
that way brings home the fact that intelligent beings will face some
<br>
moral, ethical questions when they run into this situation.  
<br>
<p>Now it might well be that nothing could be done due to the constraints
<br>
present.  But you don't irrevocably &quot;scrap&quot; living sentiences unless you
<br>
have no morals at all.  Upgrade maybe, but not scrap.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scary, maybe.  But, barring any physical requirements for specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societal values among advanced civilizations, there's no way to prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the good or the bad must happen.
</em><br>
<p>Values and morals are not simplistically dependent only on physical
<br>
requirements.  We choose the values we live by although some part of
<br>
what we value is determined to some extent by the types of creatures we
<br>
are.  But we are in the process of re-writing the types of creatures we
<br>
are.  So again, it is up to us what we decide to be and why.
