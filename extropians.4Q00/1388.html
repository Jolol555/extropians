The Possibilities of FTL:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Fermi's Paradox Reconsidered

<br>
<p>--I submit the following excerpt, one of several suggested possible
<br>
explantions of the Fermi Paradox:
<br>
<p>2.9 A galactic community exists with the capability of enforcing some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viewpoint concerning life bearing worlds.
<br>
<p>The final possibility is one where a long term stable galactic community of
<br>
civilizations exists. At some point during the 10 to 13 billion years that
<br>
advanced civilizations have had the opportunity to arise in either a single
<br>
civilization or a cooperative group of civilizations would almost certainly
<br>
have spanned the galaxy. Once such a pattern of galactic community takes
<br>
hold, it is self reinforcing as it has an inherent survival value (32).
<br>
Cooperative pooling of resources generally produces a more efficient use of
<br>
the resources. It can be seen in Earths ecosystem, both
<br>
biologically and sociologically, that cooperative behavior is reinforced. 
<br>
<p>The &quot;Anti-Social&quot; civilizations that arise would have a harder time
<br>
surviving in a galactic
<br>
environment where pre-existing civilizations could bring their more
<br>
advanced resources into play against such upstart civilizations. Likelihood
<br>
of the survival of an &quot;Anti-Social&quot; civilization is low, either initially
<br>
or in the long run. 
<br>
<p>It would appear that this galactic community is opposed to the haphazard
<br>
colonization of life
<br>
bearing worlds. The reasons for this are legion. Current attitudes in
<br>
Western civilization here on
<br>
Earth towards Third World cultures give some possible reasons. A short list
<br>
of possibilities are: 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest in unspoiled Native Cultures 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indigenous creativity may produce previously unknown items 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Code of Non-interference 
<br>

<br>
(1966), page 418.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>I would also like to draw attention to the idea, either Robin's or Gene's,
<br>
that the autoreplicators of the expansion wave achieve their maximal
<br>
expansion capability through a Darwinian selection process.  That being the
<br>
case, those *fastest* replicators will be one among a vast family of
<br>
replicators, whose various capabilities make them most suited to various
<br>
galactic niches.  Which is to say, this *family* will constitute an
<br>
ecosystem, and drawing again from the above excerpt, Mssr. Freiheit writes:
<br>

</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>One additional comment.  The high-speed, stripped down, pony-express model
<br>
replicator, would not want to drop in on a large planet or one with an
<br>
atmosphere, because both of these factors requires a larger, and therefore
<br>
more time-consuming-to-build re-launch system.  No.  To minimize the
<br>
turnaround time they want to drop in on an asteroid, maybe.  But even this
<br>
might not be optimal, because consider, escaping the gravity well of the
<br>
star itself is going to slow things down for the next jump.  Unless you
<br>
simply blast right on through without stopping, using the star's gravity
<br>
for the old slingshot effect.  Stopping in the oort cloud reduces the
<br>
gravity well problem, and although solar energy at that distance is meager,
<br>
fusion power from low-nucleon-number matter should do the trick.  Heck,
<br>
under the right circumstances the replicator could map out its route
<br>
through the system ahead of time, calculate the slingshot and desired
<br>
course correction, blast on in and through at high fractional c, never
<br>
stopping, collect and process local materials on the fly, build the landing
<br>
replicator and restock its own fuel/supplies, then deccelerate the lander
<br>
by using it as reaction mass, as it gives itself a fractional boost off to
<br>
its next stop.  Just a thought.
