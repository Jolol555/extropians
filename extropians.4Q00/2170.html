Extropians,
<br>
<p>Note when reading this that Senator-elect Hillary just
<br>
announced (I was listening to the radio when reading
<br>
this) that she would be introducing 
<br>
legislation to abolish the Electoral College...

<em>&gt;RULE OF FLAW
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by L. Neil Smith &lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:lneil@ezlink.com?Subject=Re:%20Apropos%20election:%20Fwd:%20RULE%20OF%20FLAW%20by%20L.%20Neil%20Smith&In-Reply-To=&lt;20001110195704.19287.qmail@web9802.mail.yahoo.com&gt;">lneil@ezlink.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;[*Please see &quot;A Special Request from L. Neil Smith&quot;, below]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Special to _The Libertarian Enterprise_
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I have no particular use for George W. Bush, let me make that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;perfectly clear&quot;, right up front. I am not now nor have I ever been a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Republican, even when I campaigned hard for Barry Goldwater back in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1964.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     However I do have a reason that's unimpeachable (if you'll pardon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the expression) for disliking the slimy gang of collectivists to whom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my mentor, Robert LeFevre, used to refer as &quot;Socialist Party A&quot;. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't like the rules when the rules don't serve their purpose. We all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feel that way from time to time. But when the rules don't serve their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;purpose, they expect everyone else to let them whine their way out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     We saw this phenomenon at work all throughout the eight miserable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years of the Clinton regime. The President (the Democratic president,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that is) couldn't be tarred and feathered and driven from office for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the high crimes and misdemeanors (including sexual harrassment, theft,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;graft, influence peddling, perjury, obstruction of justice, blackmail,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;treason, rape, and mass murder) that no one really bothers to deny he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;committed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     His wife, the Woman with One Eyebrow, couldn't be jailed for her
</em><br>
<em>&gt;various low crimes -- accepting bribes disguised as investment advice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conducting public meetings in secret, concealing evidence connected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with a homicide -- because, well, because she's the Woman with One
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Eyebrow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Of course the reason they offer, loudly, incessantly, for why the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rules others follow shouldn't apply equally to them is that there's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;greater cause&quot; to be considered. What they won't tell you is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;greater cause&quot; they have in mind is seizing absolute ownership and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control of your life and all the products of your life. Adolf Hitler
</em><br>
<em>&gt;slaughtered millions in that &quot;greater cause&quot;, so did Joseph Stalin,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mao Tse Tung, and Pol Pot. Waco Willie and his culture-genocidal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hordes simply aren't about to let a silly thing like the United States
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Constitution stand in their way, let alone a little statute here and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Their attitude toward the proper outcome of the election of 2000
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is exactly the same as their attitude toward, let's say, the Second
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Amendment. Despite their egalitarian rhetoric, they hate, loathe, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;despise the distributed power that ownership of personal arms bestows
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on each and every one of We the People, so they want us all to ignore
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the clearly written prohibition on any government interference with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the unalienable individual, civil, Constitutional, and human right of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;every man, woman, and responsible child to obtain, own, and carry,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;openly or concealed, any weapon -- rifle, shotgun, handgun,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machinegun, _anything_ -- any time, any place, without asking anyone's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;permission.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     A Republican victory, however slim it turns out to be, thrusts a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;big stick into their bicycle spokes, and they know it. Having suffered
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nearly a decade of Clintonism -- due to the cowardice and hesitancy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Socialist Party B&quot;, the Republicans -- advocates of liberty of every
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stripe are highly unlikely to tolerate such failures of resolve any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;longer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     They understand that it was the Milquetoast tactic practiced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the George Bush Junior campaign that brought about the sorry mess of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;November, 2000 (just as it brought about the well-earned defeats of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;George Bush Senior and of Robert Dole). They will run away with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;victory now, realizing, at long last, that the task before us is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to feebly defend ourselves from each socialist assault on our lives as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's contrived in Congress or the legislatures, but to undercut every
</em><br>
<em>&gt;move the enemies of liberty can make with a single sweeping strategy:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demanding stringent, swift, and energetic enforcement of the Bill of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Socialist Party A understands that, too, which is why it's trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to steal this election at any cost. Their present contention is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our lives must be totally re-engineered not only for cripples and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;illiterates, but that the electoral process itself is fatally flawed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if it fails to accommodate the hopelessly stupid. Yet if it weren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the infamous Palm Beach &quot;butterfly&quot; ballots, rest assured, it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any other excuse they could think of. Just like you, I've seen those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ballots (they were used in my home state for years). Anyone confused
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enough to mess up a ballot like that -- and then complain about it --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is admitting publicly that he (or she) has the intelligence of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eggplant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Which pretty much accounts for their choice of political parties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My answer -- if they want to play like that -- is that anyone who can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be confused by such a ballot is clearly disqualified to vote, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyone who voted for Albert Gore should be disqualified on the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grounds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Another thing: in any conflict between the electoral vote and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;popular vote, there _is_ no popular vote. The system as it exists was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;developed to allow a loose confederation of equal sovereign nations to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;choose a single leader, a confederation all but destroyed by a fascist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dictatorship in the 1860s. For the last 140 years, decent individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in this civilization have been struggling to reestablish that loose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;confederation. Abolishing the Electoral College is a step in the wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;direction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     The claim that the election of 2000 proves that each of our votes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;counts is untrue. If the Democrats have their way, it will have proven
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only that the whining of 19,000 morons outweighs the best efforts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most reasoned opinions of the millions who are forced to pay for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;upkeep.
</em><br>

<em>&gt;* A SPECIAL REQUEST FROM L. NEIL SMITH: My first work of non-fiction,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;_Lever Action_, is nearing completion. My publisher, Mountain Media
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(the same folks who brought you Vin Suprynowicz's splendid _Send in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Waco Killers_), have asked me for &quot;blurbs&quot; to put on the back
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cover. If you have enjoyed my essays, speeches, or novels and would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like a chance to say so to those thinking about buying my latest book,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;please write a sentence or two about it, click on the address below,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and send it to Deke Castleman at &lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:editor@huntingtonpress.com?Subject=Re:%20Apropos%20election:%20Fwd:%20RULE%20OF%20FLAW%20by%20L.%20Neil%20Smith&In-Reply-To=&lt;20001110195704.19287.qmail@web9802.mail.yahoo.com&gt;">editor@huntingtonpress.com</a>&gt;.
