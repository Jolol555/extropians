</em><br>
<p>Also to consider, this commodity is a limited one.
<br>
<p>I don't know much about petroleum, and web searches are likely to bring more
<br>
information about the industry than the geology.  Yet, I am pretty sure that there is
<br>
no ongoing process creating new petroleum at anything comparable to the rate at which
<br>
it is extracted from the earth.  If there would, that would be great and petroleum
<br>
would be a renewable resource, yet it is not, thus prices for it will only ever get
<br>
higher on the average as its availability diminishes and demand assumedly does not
<br>
drop.
<br>
<p>So petroleum from different deposits is having different relative quantities of the
<br>
various organic compounds that comprise it.  It's not a homogenous material, so there
<br>
are the refiners that crack and distill the input liquid into the various kerosenes,
<br>
oils, and gasolines.  There is presumably some kind of sludge that remains, and some
<br>
of the outputs are made into plastics and other petroleum-derived products.
<br>
<p>In the early 70's, there was little notion of fuel efficiency, until there was a oil
<br>
blockade and then fuel economy became much more of a relevant issue.  Thus by the
<br>
late 80's there were many cars with much better gas mileage for a given performance.
<br>
Yet, ten years later, only glancing at EPA stickers, it is not much better, and SUV's
<br>
are guzzlers.
<br>
<p>Some comparisons of some renewable alcohol-derived fuel versus petroleum distillate
<br>
fuel on this thread say that alcohol is more expensive, yet, an alternate accounting
<br>
can show it less expensive.
<br>
<p>An analogy was made that the tractor on the field took more fuel than the field
<br>
produced in terms of renewable biomass portable fuel.  I do not know if that is
<br>
accurate.  In some model, the tractor can be made electric and run from solar power.
<br>
That's like saying that the fuel to run gasonline trucks takes gasoline (or diesel),
<br>
but they can pump more gasolline out of the ground, until it's gone, then none can be
<br>
pumped.
<br>
<p>Of course, all power on the planet, besides nuclear power and some geothermal and
<br>
coriolis power, derives from solar power.
<br>
<p>In the last ten years, there were supposedly laws put into place saying that cars
<br>
were supposed to have certain emissions and mileage characteristics, as well as that
<br>
some use alternate fuels.
<br>
<p>About carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide emissions, coal burning should be banned.
<br>
Burning alcohol as opposed to burning gasonline emits less volatile pollutants.
<br>
<p>About carbon dioxide, it takes a lot of algae to convert as much carbon dioxide as
<br>
man creates through chemical reaction each day into oxygen and some other form of
<br>
carbon.  Perhaps someday there can be huge photosynthetic banks in the ocean creating
<br>
synthetic natural gas while converting carbon dioxide to oxygen.  It should be simple
<br>
enough to find or synthesize the correct photosynthezoid.
<br>
<p>Remember, the ozone layer over Antarctica is decimated, and there's smog over Salt
<br>
Lake and Phoenix.
