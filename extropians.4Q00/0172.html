We often talk about using technology to benefit the third world
<br>
here. This is clearly appropriate.

<p>================================================
<br>
<p><p>Friends:
<br>
<p>Charles Gay of Greenstar sent an email by
<br>
solar-powered satellite from a small village in
<br>
south-central India today. He said:
<br>
<p>================================================
<br>
<p>&quot;At 10:02 a.m. today in Parvatapur, Greenstar went
<br>
live on the internet, and simultaneously began
<br>
recording music for a digital culture program.
<br>
We used a high-speed portable satellite terminal
<br>
from Inmarsat, to connect to the Internet through
<br>
space, powered solely by a portable solar
<br>
power panel.
<br>
<p>&quot;Dedicating the village on Gandhi's birthday was
<br>
just the right touch.
<br>
<p>&quot;A large solar power array was used to power the
<br>
computers and recording equipment, and also ran
<br>
the public address system for the launch
<br>
ceremonies. All green electrons powered the
<br>
village today.
<br>
<p>&quot;Simultaneously, at a press conference in
<br>
Hyderabad, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, one
<br>
of India's leading lights in the technology
<br>
field, delivered a powerful speech about
<br>
Greenstar. He was joined by K.L.Chugh, a highly-
<br>
respected businessman, and Ms. Rajeswari of
<br>
Greenstar India.
<br>
<p>&quot;Mr. Naidu actually ordered his own Greenstar
<br>
India CD from the Greenstar website - projected
<br>
onto a large screen in front of 200 observers and
<br>
media.  In addition, the CM committed to
<br>
providing whatever government resources are
<br>
necessary to implement 50 Greenstar villages in
<br>
Andhra Pradesh.
<br>
<p>&quot;The scene in the small, isolated village of
<br>
Parvatapur, 120 miles away, was incredible. About
<br>
300 people attended four hours of speeches, in
<br>
which the Greenstar vision was compared to
<br>
Gandhi's vision. The talks were interspersed with
<br>
music, dance and poetry -- all of which were part
<br>
of the solar-powered recording sessions,
<br>
conducted by local student technicians.&quot;

<br>
and technology behind the Greenstar India launch.

Start an Ecommerce Movement

<br>
<p><p>New Delhi and Los Angeles, October 2, 2000: Greenstar
<br>
India announced today that it will build 50 solar-powered
<br>
community and ecommerce centres in remote villages
<br>
throughout India over the next three years. As part of the
<br>
celebration of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi, the first site
<br>
is being dedicated today in Parvatapur village, about 150
<br>
km from the Andhra Pradesh capital of Hyderabad in
<br>
southern India.
<br>
<p><p>Mr. Chandrababu Naidu, Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh,
<br>
will connect with events in Paravatapur today through the
<br>
Internet, where the first Indian &quot;digital culture&quot;
<br>
products will be produced, and offered to the world. The
<br>
Chief Minister will place an order for the music and art
<br>
being created by villagers hosting today's inaugural
<br>
ceremony; he will be visiting a Greenstar website at
<br>
<a href="http://www.e-greenstar.com/India/">http://www.e-greenstar.com/India/</a>
<br>
<p><p>To generate income through ecommerce, Greenstar villages
<br>
focus on India's vivid traditional culture -- authentic
<br>
art, music, legends, literature, history and sacred way of
<br>
life, long a source of fascination by people everywhere in
<br>
the world. Greenstar is employing a team of artists and
<br>
teachers to record elements of rural Indian culture,
<br>
working closely with the people of each village. This
<br>
original concept is already working in the Palestinian
<br>
Authority and Jamaica. The result will be a powerful,
<br>
unique collection of &quot;digital culture&quot; -- a gallery of
<br>
music, artwork, photographs, video, poetry and other arts,
<br>
which can be distributed in high-resolution digital form
<br>
throughout the world, instantly and efficiently.
<br>
<p><p>The revenues from digital culture will be used to fund
<br>
basic needs of each village for its future, as decided by
<br>
the people themselves -- deploying tools that include
<br>
clean solar power, telemedicine and vaccination resources,
<br>
basic education, micro-credit, community organizing, and a
<br>
high-speed, two-way connection to the world through the
<br>
Internet.
<br>
<p><p>The company behind these investments is Greenstar India, a
<br>
new consortium of companies from India and the United
<br>
States. Stakeholders include Capital Fortunes, a
<br>
Hyderabad-based financial and business advisory
<br>
consultancy, the Jindal Organization based in Delhi with
<br>
operations throughout India and America, and Greenstar
<br>
USA, which has pioneered the solar-powered ecommerce and
<br>
digital culture concept. The participating companies are
<br>
providing capital, technology and resources. Other key
<br>
players are Indian government agencies and private
<br>
participants including the Ekalavya Vidayalya Foundation,
<br>
Ikisan, Kinera Object Connect, and the Renewable Energy
<br>
Office at the Centre for Scientific Research of Auroville.
<br>
<p><p>Major support for Greenstar India comes from The Sterling
<br>
Group, a company that has led the way in providing high-
<br>
speed Internet access in India. Through its subsidiary,
<br>
Dishnet/DSL (<a href="http://www.dishnetdsl.com/">http://www.dishnetdsl.com/</a>), Sterling will
<br>
provide all the internet connections for Greenstar
<br>
villages, including free Web hosting, and will sponsor a
<br>
village demonstration in the Chennai region in the near
<br>
future.
<br>
<p><p>The first Greenstar India project is in Parvatapur in the
<br>
Mahabubnagar District of Andhra Pradesh. This community
<br>
has a deep tradition of music and art, and has been
<br>
pioneering natural agricultural practices. Digital culture
<br>
techniques are the only means feasible for preserving the
<br>
intricate colored chalk art practiced in the village, and
<br>
the spontaneous drumming and storytelling of the Telugu
<br>
people.
<br>
<p><p>See backgrounder below for more in-depth
<br>
information on the people, ideas, policies and
<br>
technologies behind Greenstar India. A selection of
<br>
photographs of Parvatapur and Andhra Pradesh is also
<br>
available.
