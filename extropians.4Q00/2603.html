</em><br>
<p>This has been discussed on eBay - some of the other auction sites do
<br>
this (I think Yahoo auctions).  Sellers would generally prefer it, and
<br>
bidders who don't try to put in last-minute bids.  But there are some
<br>
vocal bidders who rely on the technique who oppose changes.
<br>
<p>The idea of a probabilistic cutoff is also interesting but probably
<br>
not practical for voting.  It doesn't seem &quot;fair&quot;, too unpredictable.
<br>
Randomness isn't a desirable quality in a voting protocol.
<br>
<p>Something similar has been used a few times on the FX game, where there
<br>
were claims betting about FX parameters which might have been subject to
<br>
manipulation if the parameter was tested at a known time.  So the claims
<br>
were set up to test the parameter at random times chosen over a period of
<br>
weeks, with the claim value being based on the average of these samples.
