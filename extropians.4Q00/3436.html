<p>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Being new to extropy, and having just begun thinking about this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  subject, I've been trying to decide how I feel about this whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  cloning/uploading/backup thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Some of us have been thinking about/debating/discussing/analyzing this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subject for a -very- long time.
</em><br>
<p>I mentioned that only to say, &quot;Hey, I know how you body-lovers feel. 
<br>
I haven't been thinking about being a cyborg for so long that I've 
<br>
forgotten about existence as a human being and all of the instincts 
<br>
that it entails.&quot;  Some might find that statement of value in 
<br>
relating to what I was saying, some might not.  As I had mentioned, I 
<br>
was just stating some conclusions, not a whole argument.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; My only further question is why the people in this thread so adverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  to backup restoration don't just admit that they're basing their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  decision upon a subjective sentimental factor and be done with it in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  a somewhat intellectually honest fashion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Tsk tsk!  You mean: you've decided that attachment to a particular discrete
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experience is subjective sentinmentalism and those who differ should stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being intellectually dishonest and just agree with you?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, that'd be a bit egocentric of me.  The intellectual dishonesty 
<br>
exists whether or not I'm around.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;-True- intellectual honesty, Chris, would mandate a recognition of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complexity and subtle ramifications of the issues.
</em><br>
<p>I've yet to see anyone show that those complexities and ramifications 
<br>
are anything but sentimentality.  I'd be interested in seeing 
<br>
otherwise.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; Instead, I've seen only the use of equivocation for words like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &quot;consciousness&quot; and &quot;continuity&quot; in some hopeless effort at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  maintaining a logical argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Hopeless effort at maintaining a logical argument???&quot;  Wow.  Those are big
</em><br>
<em>&gt;words.  Well, since you have so incisively pierced through my intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dishonesty and uncovered the hopeless illogic of my arguments, it should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exceedingly trivial for you to point out the myriad of intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discrepencies that I have perpetrated in my equivocal and sentimental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rationalizing (dare we even call it rational??)
</em><br>
<p>:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Even though the many flaws of my reasoning might be ridiculously obvious, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invite you to make an actual *argument* -- it is notoriously more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;efficacious at exposing illogic than are unsubstantianted pronouncements of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enlightenment.
</em><br>
<p>Damnit, I shouldn't be spending the time on this, but okay.  Let me 
<br>
start a new thread on this with your question.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
