<p>What about the concept that going back to change the past either eliminates the
<br>
future timeline you came from, or shifts you over to a new timeline (depending
<br>
on whether you buy multiverses or just a single timeline at any given time).
<br>
Thus, the future always is indeterminate.
<br>
Now, as to market weighting, I was under the impression that a market 'failure'
<br>
is really only a failure of participants to accurately predict correct prices,
<br>
that the 'correction' that occurs in a 'failure' is really just the market
<br>
forces re-asserting themselves over the improperly distorted choices of
<br>
participants who are empowered disproportionately by outside factors like
<br>
governments, regulation, etc., so in a sense, it is regressing to its true mean
<br>
on the timeline.
