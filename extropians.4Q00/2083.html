<p>
<em>&gt; Sometimes, studying neuroscience and working in a lab, I get mired in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minutia, and sort of lose faith.  Then I read something that galvanizes my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolve.  Goedel, Escher, Bach was one.  Anything by Damasio works.
</em><br>
Dennet
<br>
<em>&gt; is pretty good, too.  This article was another.
</em><br>
<p>I've been rather disappointed by Damasio's works.  No matter what the man
<br>
attempts to explain through his adherence to physicalism, he is still left
<br>
without any explanation for why we can function as independent beings, or
<br>
what the true root of consciousness is.  He explains nothing that hasn't
<br>
already been determined, and adds little to the philosophical dialogue
<br>
surrounding the concept of consciousness.  Even the idea that all subjective
<br>
experience can be empirically measured still breaks down due to the fact
<br>
that reading into the precise meaning of every neural connection and
<br>
chemical pair would require the interpretation through a new symbolic system
<br>
based upon the structure of the brain itself, which would have to be created
<br>
by another mind- thus, we can never escape the subjective nature of
<br>
objective reality.  Our brain just doesn't work that way.
<br>
<p>Dennet's work, &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot;, might better have been titled
<br>
&quot;Consciousness Explained Away&quot; (To borrow a quote from Ken Wilber's essay
<br>
series &quot;The Eye of Spirit&quot;).  It is an objective, conscious attempt at
<br>
denying the existence of consciousness, through denying the validity of
<br>
subjective experience.
<br>
<p>I don't believe that I've posted to this elist before.  My name is Nicq
<br>
MacDonald, and I am a student of Philosophy and Psychology at the University
<br>
of St. Thomas, in St. Paul Minnesota.  I became interested in the Extropian
<br>
movement after reading about it in an essay by noted &quot;Ontological Anarchist&quot;
<br>
Hakim Bey.  After searching several web sites for data, and investigating
<br>
the core documents provided online, I noticed that the idea behind
<br>
extropianism is comparable to the backstory of a fantasy I had been working
<br>
on a few years ago, revolving around a future, &quot;post-singularity&quot; world in
<br>
which the great mass of humanity has forgotten how to command the
<br>
nanotechnological fabric that now supports the world, and is kept in the
<br>
firm grip of a dark age dominated by a transhuman demiurge, in which only
<br>
the gnostics who know how to wield the ancient technology have a chance to
<br>
escape into the transhuman realm.  Although I certainly hope that our world
<br>
doesn't turn out that way, and I'm certainly not against the extropian
<br>
movement, being cautious can't hurt...
