<p>Carrier pigeon?  Luxury!  Why I remember when we had to chisel
<br>
ASCII code into granite punch cards.  The floppies each had a capacity of
<br>
one bit.  And they crashed half the time.  The error message was:
<br>
&quot;Data unreadable.  Was it a 0 or a 1?&quot;  Since the clock rate on the
<br>
computers was one cycle per minute, each floppy took about an hour to
<br>
read, and of course it took 8 of em per character.  The hard disks
<br>
were the size of tabletop and they didnt actually have a motor, you
<br>
had to wind em up. Then you had to move the read head by hand to
<br>
the place on the disk where you thought the data was.  The keyboards
<br>
in those days had only two keys, a 1 and a 0.  Programming was
<br>
tedious.  We got better.  spike
