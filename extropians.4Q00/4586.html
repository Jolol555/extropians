<p><em>&gt;They tried to this, but, I believe, they failed.  So do many others,

<p>What difference in functionality is there between the maths &quot;+&quot; sign,
<br>
the natural language &quot;and&quot; word, and the logical symbol for 
<br>
conjunction (upturned U)? Same for all the other logical and
<br>
mathematical operators. I think that maths has a psychological
<br>
(logos = mind) basis rather than an observable, empirical basis.
<br>
<p>S&gt; &gt;Einstein's E=MC^2 was a philosophical
<br>
S&gt; &gt;argument until science proved it later.
<br>

S&gt; This a claim from Physics, not algebra ... or academic
<br>
S&gt; philosophy come to that.
<br>
<p>Not actually.  Einstein made certain assumptions and deduced things from
<br>
them.  In some ways, his assumptions were bolder, more consistent, and more
<br>
parsimonious than those of others.
<br>
<p>Maths deals with generalities: &quot;Energy is Mass speedolight squared&quot; or
<br>
whatever is a claim about physical properties .... sure Einstein used
<br>
THOUGHT experiments, but Philosophy cannot claim proprietorship
<br>
over all types of &quot;thinking&quot; (see fuller response to Harvey Newstrom)...
