<p>Why, I'm glad you asked that question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From TRANSREALIST FICTION (Greenwood, 2000):
</em><br>
<p>===========
<br>
<p>A novel, orthodoxy once instructed us, is a long invented story, told in a
<br>
clear prose, that describes what we are to see in prompted imagination,
<br>
transcribes what we are to hear, evokes the thoughts and memories of
<br>
characters who do not exist in reality, and sometimes comments upon and
<br>
evaluates these invented lives.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, no. Of course that is not it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Vladimir Nabokov, a novel might be a longish poem attended by ever
<br>
more bizarre footnotes (Pale Fire, 1962). Italo Calvino made one out of
<br>
fragments of barely-begun novels allegedly by other people (If On a
<br>
Winter's Night a Traveller, 1981). James Joyce wrote one all of dreams, in
<br>
a glossolalia that tempts even as it repels (Finnegans Wake, 1939). Martin
<br>
Amis tracked his Nazi doctor backward through time to his innocent
<br>
redemption (Time's Arrow, or The Nature of the Offence, 1991).
<br>
Postmodernists generally scatter the literary landscape with oddities and
<br>
triumphs of form, imagination working on language as a confectioner whips
<br>
sugar and egg white.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many stolid souls, yearning for a good 19th century read, or even for a
<br>
good Doris Lessing before she turned to turgid allegory, will agree with
<br>
these demurrals. Yes, those are all novels, too--alas.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not all departures from the canonical format are automatically
<br>
slipstream, or transrealist in the sense I use in this book, some plainly
<br>
stand at the boundary. Consider Stanislaw Lem's Hospital of the
<br>
Transfiguration (1989), which at first glance seems a strikingly realistic
<br>
account of occupation life shortly after the German invasion of Poland but
<br>
is nothing so simple.
<br>
<p>FROM EARTH TO CYBERIA
<br>
<p>Stanislaw Lem is the pre-eminent European sf writer, standing somewhere
<br>
between the technical dazzle of Alfred Bester and the speculative sociology
<br>
of Isaac Asimov. Better, perhaps, he is the Polish equivalent of Italo
<br>
Calvino or Jorge Luis Borges, a fabulist whose invented worlds seem at once
<br>
more opulent and clarified than the world of experience. His approach to
<br>
fiction has grown more uncompromisingly intellectual with every book, so
<br>
that his piercing melancholy seems unassuageable by anything warm, kind,
<br>
generous in human life. A terrible Olympian laughter goes with the cool
<br>
assessment, however, so that it is hard to know if Lem is a Martian adrift
<br>
among people or a human lost among absurd aliens. His reputation and
<br>
world-wide fame is founded on a kind of sf derived directly from Verne and
<br>
Wells, by-passing commercial western models. In his first published novel,
<br>
Hospital of the Transfiguration, Lem's beautifully observed vignettes fold
<br>
together, with exquisite placement, like the elements of a ritual, perhaps
<br>
an exorcism, holding the past even as it purges its unbearable grief. This
<br>
is territory trodden more recently, of course, by such writers as D. M.
<br>
Thomas and Martin Amis, using much the same transgressive apparatus.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan Trzyiecki, like Lem himself at the time a student doctor (though
<br>
slightly older, so that he begins his practice in wartime), attends an
<br>
uncle's funeral in a village where his family have been minor notables for
<br>
centuries. As distant and alienated from his kin as Joyce's Stephen
<br>
Dedalus, Stefan watches the obsequies with a certain distaste: all this
<br>
confused bustle of life, family politics, evasion and warmth. By the
<br>
novel's end, Stefan is lying in the arms of a cool, lovely woman whose name
<br>
he does not know, in the hay of a stable, `as blank and empty as the moment
<br>
of his birth' (ibid, p. 207). That journey to nativity is Poland's funeral
<br>
rites as well, his nation's uncertain re-birth into a condition of internal
<br>
exile that it is only now, fifty years later, finally able to challenge.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Hospital of the Transfiguration was completed in 1948, it was not
<br>
published until 1955--victim of the hegemony of `socialist realism'--nor
<br>
translated into English until the late 1980s with the fall of the Soviet
<br>
system. Yet it is not easy for us to see what the Polish communist
<br>
authorities found technically offensive in the book, which evades realism
<br>
only in its structure, and then only to the attuned eye. Even in his
<br>
twenties, though, Lem was clearly struggling with those questions of form
<br>
and narrative strategy which were to turn him away from the quotidian and
<br>
into landscapes of the cognitive imagination. More recently he has written:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those days have pulverised and exploded all narrative conventions that had
<br>
previously been used in literature. The unfathomable futility of human life
<br>
under the sway of mass murder cannot be conveyed by literary techniques in
<br>
which individuals or small groups form the core of the narrative. 
<br>
<p>If Thomas Mann found a tuberculosis clinic and apt metaphor for the decline
<br>
of the west, many writers since have looked to a more extreme figure: the
<br>
lunatic asylum, the cuckoo's nest. Almost by accident Stefan takes a job in
<br>
a mental hospital named, with grotesque irony, for Christ in his
<br>
transfigured state after the resurrection. There is little enough hope of
<br>
rebirth for these poor souls. In the era before sophisticated psychoactive
<br>
medication, Lem's site is the customary Bedlam of heedless, untrained
<br>
orderlies and medical staff themselves on the verge of craziness. Each is
<br>
sketched with precision and wit as Lem puts his carnival through its paces
<br>
before the authentic madness begins, when the SS arrive to murder the
<br>
doctors' charges, those supposedly less-than-human victims of disease,
<br>
stress and the accidents of genetics.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the heart of the novel is a truly horrifying Foucauldian rebus of the
<br>
whole, a clinically described operation to remove a tumour from the brain
<br>
of a patient who has been deteriorating under the enthralled gaze of his
<br>
surgeon. Kauters (a suitable emblematic name) is the sole German physician
<br>
among these Poles, destined to cower and blubber before his triumphant
<br>
countrymen. At the operating table he delves and tears into the naked brain
<br>
like a mining engineer dredging a sacred site, scorching tissue when an
<br>
artery is cut, scooping out the cancer until, to his exasperation, the
<br>
patient lies dead. Beyond the walls of the asylum, in a local power
<br>
station, Polish patriots smuggle arms to partisans and brood upon the
<br>
bodies of suicides charred black by electricity. Lem's world in this
<br>
apparently realist first novel is at once pitiless and aching with pity, a
<br>
small gem of a book gleaming across the decades like a drop of blood caught
<br>
in a spotlight.
