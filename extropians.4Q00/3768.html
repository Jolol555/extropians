Im only going to hit on the first paragraph here as an in depth breakdown
<br>
would take WAY to long.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One of the libertarian's favorite slogans is &quot;taxation is theft&quot;, but the
</em><br>
counter is &quot;property is theft&quot;. Who's right? Depends on your values,
<br>
actually.
<br>
<p>Property is theft? How can anything be &quot;stolen&quot; from anybody when no-one can
<br>
own anything?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you think private property is the basis for hierarchical enslavement of
</em><br>
the masses, you'd say the latter.
<br>
<p>Private property isnt a &quot;system&quot; as your implying... Its the right to life ,
<br>
made concrete. A person needs to make things to stay alive. They need to
<br>
control items in their environment to not starve to death. The limit of
<br>
thier action is the boundary of the other person's rights. The &quot;science&quot; of
<br>
law is the attempt to discover this boundary as clearly as possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By what standard is anything judged? My standards aren't accepted by
</em><br>
everyone.
<br>
<p>You premise here is that standards are not objective. I havent met a person
<br>
yet that doesnt follow the standard of gravity. I can sum up this
<br>
nonsensical line of thinking this way. If you want to say that the universe
<br>
is subjective, then you just tried to make an objective statment about the
<br>
universe. Naturally this is self contridictory.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt;As someone else (Hal, I think) pointed out, they could say the same about
</em><br>
you. One of the libertarian's favorite slogans is &quot;taxation is theft&quot;, but
<br>
the counter is &quot;property is theft&quot;. Who's right? Depends on your values,
<br>
actually. If you think property rights are the basis of civilization, you'd
<br>
say the former. If you think private property is the basis for hierarchical
<br>
enslavement of the masses, you'd say the latter. By what standard is
<br>
anything judged? My standards aren't accepted by everyone.&lt;
