<em>&gt; &gt;There are definite advantages to high heartrate aerobic exercise, say 5

<em>&gt; &gt;times a week for 45 minutes or so. Keep ya from having one of those dreaded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;heart attacks :-) As for going for the muscle-bound superman look I am not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;so sure of any benefits from that unless you are a leader of some organization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and have to look good in public. I fear that all the extra calories burned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to keep that muscle mass happy may actually reduce your lifespan slightly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would say that 45 minutes of strongly aerobic exercise five times a week
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is excessive. I think you can get virtually the same health benefit from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around 25 minutes four times a week, with far less free radical formation.
</em><br>
<p>I'd have to disagree.. my understanding (feel free to prove me wrong) is that
<br>
you really have to do a minimum of 30 minutes of steady aerobic exercise
<br>
to really have any effect on your cardio system. Extending that a bit to 45
<br>
minutes will lead to even better shape. Combine this of course with some good
<br>
anti-oxidants daily. I think going for the extra cardio conditioning is worth
<br>
it since heart related problems are one of the top killers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for building muscle mass -- certainly excessive bodybuilding is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimal for health, especially if the bodybuilder is using steroids in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their current form to grow muscle tissue without regard to side-effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I've found that people are relatively unaware of the benefits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight-training as compared to aerobic exercise. It is most definitely not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all a matter of appearance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Weight-training/bodybuilding when done sensibly improves glucose metabolism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and insulin response, lowers blood sugar (=less glycosylation) and reduces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk of diseases (including diabetes), maintains or restores bone mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (very important as you age, *especially* for women reaching menopause), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improves the sense of well-being (more than aerobic exercise).
</em><br>
<p>I definitely can agree that doing some serious weight training is practically
<br>
a requirement say once you hit your 40s. As for diabetes, etc. I believe (again
<br>
correct me if wrong) that regular aerobic exercise is probably even better
<br>
than weight training in terms of prevention. See a basic article here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/health_tip/ttsthpd.html">http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/health_tip/ttsthpd.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beyond those benefits, others will be more relative to the individual. Here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would include how healthy, powerful, and vigorous you look. Some of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to sculpt our bodies, others see them as mere vehicles of no aesthetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest.
</em><br>
<p>This is the part that I find a little off-putting.. like I said if it helps
<br>
you in your job or whatever that's a good thing. But other than that, I see
<br>
it as a waste of time to try to attain some kind of &quot;look&quot; and hold it. I
<br>
could understand it if you are planning to try to maintain a physical body
<br>
far into the future... some people dig that, but myself I prefer to just be
<br>
uploaded and modify my body image at will after that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Improved physical strength may save your life in some circumstances and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful in many more situations. Given that caloric restriction with good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nutrition is life-extending, muscle building has the extremely important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit of giving you tissue to burn in an emergency if you don't have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fat. I've seen friends lose 30-50 lbs very quickly in hospital. If you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calorically restricted and have neither body fat nor muscle tissue, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medical emergency could just kill you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Remember that I'm not recommending two hour workouts daily. That would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed mean unnecessary free radical formation. You can get tremendous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health benefits from shorter, focused workouts. (Mine are 30-40 minutes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including plenty of rest between sets. But when I do a set, I'm working at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peak capacity.)
</em><br>
<p>Right, I just worry about all the extra oxidization going on in all those
<br>
extra muscle cells. Have there been any studies done on this?
<br>
<p>Overall I just don't see a good reason for the average person to do weight
<br>
training in addition to regular aerobic exercise, UNLESS they need it for
<br>
specific reasons such as their job, their age, desire to participate in
<br>
extreme sports, etc.
