<em>&gt; Transhumanist, she was honestly interested in what I was interested in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And became a Transhumanist herself. Now she sits for hours in front of

<p>You are lucky indeed.

<br>
<em>&gt; But I don't think my Mom's the only Mom that doesn't dislike

</em><br>
<p>My father is an artist, with the same sort of obsessive
<br>
singlemindedness that I try not to exhibit (but do) toward science and
<br>
technology.  Which is to say, if something isn't ART and we're talking
<br>
Van Gough or earlier, then it's worthless. My mom actually can grasp
<br>
the concepts, and isn't shocked by them, and can even be supportive.
<br>
Then again, she also believes in Astrology, Feng Shui, Christianity,
<br>
biorythms, homeopathy, and god only knows what else.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the difference between an Extropian and a New Ager is that both
<br>
score high on Eliezer's Shock Level scale, but the New Ager doesn't
<br>
have ver fanciful thinking counterbalanced by the discipline of
<br>
rational, critical thinking.
