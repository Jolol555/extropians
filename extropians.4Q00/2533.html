</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'd have to disagree.. my understanding (feel free to prove me wrong) is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you really have to do a minimum of 30 minutes of steady aerobic exercise
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I have to disagree with your disagreement. :-)  Aerobic conditioning 
<br>
certainly begins no later than 10 minutes after training range is attained. 
<br>
25 minutes gives you most of the preventive health benefits. I'll go look 
<br>
this up when I have more time. But I can say that I wouldn't have gotten 
<br>
such a high aerobic fitness rating in my Kronos Clinic testing if what you 
<br>
say is true. I never continue aerobic exercise past 25 minutes.
<br>
<p>When I'm talking about aerobic exercise, I'm not referring to girly-man low 
<br>
heart rate exercise. ;-)  I'm talking about maintaining my heart rate at 
<br>
the upper end of the fitness training range. (Last night's 3 mile run 
<br>
quickly brought my heart rate up to 165, then it climbed to 170-180 for 
<br>
most of the workout. I use a Polar heart monitor--this is cool tech that 
<br>
lets you see your heart rate in real time on a watch or displayed on most 
<br>
treadmills.)
<br>
<p>45 minutes several times a week might be needed to get most of the benefits 
<br>
if someone is training a lower level of intensity. According to Dr. Kenneth 
<br>
Cooper, running any more than 15 miles per week will not bring increased 
<br>
health benefits. If I were to run for 45 minutes five days a week at close 
<br>
to my current pace, I'd cover about 30 miles. At my pace, 25 minutes 
<br>
several times a week seems just about optimal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is the part that I find a little off-putting.. like I said if it helps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you in your job or whatever that's a good thing. But other than that, I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it as a waste of time to try to attain some kind of &quot;look&quot; and hold it. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could understand it if you are planning to try to maintain a physical body
</em><br>
<em>&gt;far into the future... some people dig that, but myself I prefer to just be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;uploaded and modify my body image at will after that.
</em><br>
<p>When do you expect to be uploaded? I'm not willing to wait for a future 
<br>
technology to save my body, not knowing when it will happen. The clear 
<br>
health, strength, and mood-enhancing benefits of resistance exercise give 
<br>
me clear reasons to do it. The enhanced body image is an enjoyable plus. If 
<br>
uploading takes decades (which I think fairly likely but practically 
<br>
unknowable) then I will have decades to enjoy the results of my exercise, 
<br>
and I'll be a vigorous grey-haired guy while wait-for-uploading folks will 
<br>
be shuffling around and asking for    a hand with their luggage. :-)
<br>
<p>Weight-training does have clear health benefits such as stronger, healthier 
<br>
bones, reduced LDL levels, and lowers total cholesterol, among other 
<br>
things. Some references:

<br>
1984): 336-340
