<p><em>&gt;Can you briefly share some of the core elements of the unique
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought that Mr Aaberg is bringing this field?
</em><br>
<p>I don't have it with me today but here goes.
<br>
<p>One of the things I liked was his approaching the whole issue from
<br>
the perspective of biomechanics. He gives an excellent introduction
<br>
to the various parts of the skeletal system, muscles and joints and
<br>
how they interelate. Simple things, like pointing out that muscles
<br>
can't push, they can only contract and use bones as levers. Sounds
<br>
simple but it affects the way you think about things. Or the fact
<br>
that weights don't actually do anything, it is GRAVITY which only
<br>
moves in one direction (towards the center of the earth) so
<br>
naturally this is the precise direction the weight should travel
<br>
for maximum effectiveness. Simple things like making sure the
<br>
exercise is oriented along the length of the fiber, which is the
<br>
direction it contracts in.
<br>
<p>He argues against the confusion of all the different names for
<br>
exercises and proposes an effective nomenclature. It has three
<br>
parts, the first being the type of resistance, the second the
<br>
muscle being worked, and the third being the activity. For example
<br>
a &quot;bench press&quot; becomes either a &quot;barbell chest press, a &quot;dumbell
<br>
chest press,&quot; or a &quot;smith machine chest press&quot;. Simple but very
<br>
effective.
<br>
<p>In the long section on different exercises he will show several
<br>
ways to work each muscle with both free weights and machines. Each
<br>
page has a black and white drawing of the body with the muscles
<br>
being worked shaded in blue, also  a list of the muscles involved.
<br>
Very effective.
<br>
<p>I like the way he argues for maximizing effective exercise while
<br>
minimizing any chance of injury. 
<br>
<p>In short he imparts a great deal of knowledge in a very effective
<br>
way.
<br>
<p>I own a number of books on the subject and found this one both
<br>
unique and a valuble addition. I thought it would be particularly
<br>
good for beginners, and yet, it has plenty of information for more
<br>
advanced users. I found it very extropian in scope.
