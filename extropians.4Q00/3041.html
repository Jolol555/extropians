Color receptors are not really dimensions, they are simply separate
<br>
ranges in the visual spectrum, and only overlap a bit. Likewise, deer
<br>
have only two color receptors, so they see the world as a matter of
<br>
blue, yellow, and shades of grey in between (which is why they don't see
<br>
blaze orange)

<em>&gt; &gt; It would take some time to get used to your two eyes seeing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different colors, but perhaps it would eventually become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unconscious.  There were famous experiments back in the 60s in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people wore special glasses that turned the visual image upside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; down!  After a few days they got used to it and everything looked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; normal.  Then when they took the glasses off they had to adjust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; again.  If people can adapt to such a radical change as this, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; incorporating some extra color information ought to be easy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         There is a huge categorical difference between having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additional colors in our color awareness and simply inverting an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise subjectively similar image and it eventually seeming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normal.  The article touched on this a bit by pointing out that simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having an extra 4th receptor in the eye isn't enough for us to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aware of an additional color.  You must also have an additional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; channel in the optic nerve to convey the added information to the part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our brain where the awareness is produced (the visual cortex) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course the most important part of all is, one's conscious knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must be enhanced to be able to produce additional quale to represent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this 4th color dimension in order to be what I would consider a full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blown subjective &quot;tetrachromate&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         I'd bet that, given what little was in this article, It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely that Mrs M is simply mapping the set of trichromatic color
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia produced by most of our visual cortexes in our consciousness a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little more broadly over the tetrachromic set of information, hence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still enabling her to distinguish differences in perception better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a trichromat, yet not really experiencing a truly subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tetrachromatic experience or in other words Mrs M can't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience any additional subjective color qualia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Or can she!?  To me that would be by far the more interresting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question in all this.  Who cares what one can perceive compared to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what it is really subjectively like!?  As in, will I ever be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say: &quot;Oh wow, that gred (or whatever) color is fantastic and nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like I've ever experienced&quot;, thanks for enhancing my primary visual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cortex so it can produce this new quale in my subjective awareness!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now can you make me a tetrachromat and wire the additional sensors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; added to my eyes, through an addition chanel added to my optic nerve,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to this new quale my visual cortex can now produce in my consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so I can be a subjectively full blown tetrachromat!?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         And are there more than just 3 (or 4) dimensions to the qualia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible in this physical universe so that our visual cortex can use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such enhanced awareness to be aware of data from receptors that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pick up additional information not just between red and green, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from outside the visible spectrum altogether!?  I don't just want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reuse the qualia I've got and map the additional spectrum my sensors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can pick up into this! I want more qualia too!  If so, you'd be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do a lot more than just zip through the internet faster!!!
