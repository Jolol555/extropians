A better idea then volunteering time and money to the Green party to detract 
<br>
votes from the Democratic party is to form your own local Green party and 
<br>
run for office. You could certainly get more votes doing that then you can 
<br>
just campaigning for some other candidate. It also puts you in a position to 
<br>
confuse and jumble the Green positions, making the overall term &quot;Green 
<br>
party&quot; less meaningful. Look what it did for the reform party - the only 
<br>
position they had with Perot was &quot;reform the government&quot; (which is somewhat 
<br>
akin to washing shit), they were open. The Greens aren't as open - but 
<br>
they're pretty open and undefined in most people's minds, as many people who 
<br>
purport to be supporters of them only do so because they see Nader as &quot;an 
<br>
alternative to the status quo&quot;, and really know very little about them and 
<br>
their exact positions except that they're environmentalist/socialist types 
<br>
(I've heard people who used to talk highly about the LP now talking highly 
<br>
about the GP in a similar light, as if their opposite ideologies are 
<br>
interchangeable because they're both &quot;an alternative&quot;).
<br>
With some well placed memetic terrorism, the Green party ideology could be 
<br>
as absent as the Reform party ideology is, an ideology wide enough to 
<br>
accomodate both Pat Buchanan and John Hagelin.
<br>
Come to think of it - after looking at Hagelin's site a bit 
<br>
(<a href="http://www.hagelin.org/">http://www.hagelin.org/</a>) I wonder if he's a closet Green trying just this 
<br>
same tactic on the Reform Party.. good for him.
<br>
Everyone should do this to every political party and drag them all down.
