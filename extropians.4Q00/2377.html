<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seriously.  Many people who are, legally, perfectly innocent believe

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm with you there. I know I'm a law abiding citizen. I also typically am armed.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have nothing to fear legally from cops, so any action they take against me is&gt; by definition illegal action, and I am legally able (and justified) to defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; myself against such *felonious* criminal actions by police. Any jurisdiction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; which would treat me any differently is, by definition, a tyranny. Insisting on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; living under tyranny implies the acceptance of that tyranny, if the means and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ability to leave that tyranny exist. If you fear such tyranny, vote with your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; feet. If you don't, its like not voting: you don't get to complain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And what of those, typically poor and/or with non-easily-mobile assets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (like their family or community) to defend, who can not practically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; leave, but who live in a tyranny as you have defined it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A community is not an asset that belongs to you, and if its tyrannical, it must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be worth much, or else you must enjoy tyrannical communities. Make up your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind. 
</em><br>
<p>A community can be prized for many different things.  I prize living in
<br>
Silicon Valley at the center of so much tech craze and with Foresight
<br>
and so on down the street enough to put up with California stupidity and
<br>
with ultra high costs, for now.  The equation of what is and is not
<br>
worth the cost is not simple. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I personally find that more poor people move around far more frequently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than more affluent people, so your argument does not hold. Welfare people seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to find it quite easy to move from city to city and state to state to follow the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best benefits, according to the data. U-HAUL and KOA are wonderful things. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could move my own household for $500-$1000 from coast to coast with little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trouble. People seem to excel at finding reasons to not do things far more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding reasons to do things.
</em><br>
<p>Having been dirt poor once or twice in my long life I can assure you
<br>
that moving is no picnic when you haven't hardly (if at all) the money
<br>
for this month's rent plus groceries much less for first, last and
<br>
moving costs.  The costs you list above is far beyond what can be
<br>
afforded when you are really poor.  Welfare?  I was never eligible for
<br>
one bureaucratic reason or another, not even when I was literally down
<br>
and out enough to be eating out of soup kitchens.  I was pretty dumb and
<br>
down and out in those long ago days but I wasn't a simple parasite
<br>
following the crumbs of welfare to the easiest pickings.
