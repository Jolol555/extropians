<p><em>&gt; I was thinking about qualia - wondering what would happen if my brain were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suddenly receiving inputs about other wavelengths of light besides those in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the visible range, x-rays suppose - would I immediately associate novel 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colors with them, or it would take some time to learn?
</em><br>
<p>How would the brain receive the inputs? If you use the axons of the
<br>
optic nerve, then the X-ray stimuli would induce sensations similar to
<br>
the ordinary colors. If you tack on new connections, then you might
<br>
get something completely new, assuming it doesn't get linked up with
<br>
something already defined in your brain (which is most likely in an
<br>
adult brain, I think; lets try it with an embryonic brain).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; realized that since I have (at least) red/green color blindness I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may get to find out sooner then normal, since a treatment for color
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blindness will probably be developed before x-ray vision.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately there is not that much work on curing color blindness
<br>
today - it would be very hard with current methods, it is actually not
<br>
that debilitating aand most color blind people don't complain. A cure
<br>
would as you say involve adding a population of cones and ganglion
<br>
cells to the whole retina, and then getting them to organise
<br>
themselves into something useful in the brain. I think this would be
<br>
tricky in an adult, even if the organisational abilities of cortex are
<br>
amazing. It is easier than x-ray vision in that the cones are
<br>
pre-existing structures (how you make a good x-ray receptor for a cell
<br>
beats me, I guess our resident nanotechies will have the solution
<br>
instantly :-), but then actually on the same order of trickyness.
<br>
<p>Your experience might give a hint on just how odd feelings we might
<br>
get when we start adding new senses and realise just how much we have
<br>
missed - the ultraviolet markings on flowers, the infrared heat-traces
<br>
and color shifts, X-ray sources in the sky, the subtle odors a dog
<br>
would immediately notice, the ultrasounds of everyday objects, the
<br>
j'khguis of woifang eyg...
<br>
<p>(of course, we might have to recompile our brains and add new kernel
<br>
modules to fully appreciate them)
