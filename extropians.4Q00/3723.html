<p><p><em>&gt; ... and as we add new stuff, we can slowly shut off old stuff. Eventually,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the transition is complete. Like the axe handed down through generations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; head replaced 3 times, handle replaced 7 times, the components have
</em><br>
changed,
<br>
<em>&gt; but identity remains. I think we can fully upload, and retain conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integrity.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p>Now -here's- someone on my wavelength.  (Thanks for picking up the ball on
<br>
these threads Emlyn-- your excellent &quot;which-of-the-copies-is-most-me
<br>
response&quot; saved me a long email. :)
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;Not by a copy mechanism, however; only by gradual modification
<br>
<em>&gt; (how gradual? I don't know).
</em><br>
<p>Me either, but I expect we'll find out pretty rapidly once direct-brain
<br>
peripherals become available.  I, for instance, am -very- interested in just
<br>
adding general neural substrate and seeing what happens.  We already know
<br>
that the current brain architecture is remarkably plastic.  I suspect that
<br>
we would take advantage of new hardware surprisingly quickly.  I can already
<br>
imagine the rapid reinforcement of the neural pathways attaching us to our
<br>
new 1ns-access-time-short-term-memory.
<br>
<p>(Would your brain quickly figure out that if it remembers something 'in a
<br>
particular way' it consistently gets better results?)
<br>
<p>I really do think you could 'coax' the whole consciousness into a new
<br>
substrate by this means.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Unfortunately, this is not an information scenario, and means there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility of backups. Of course, backups can be made, and run, and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be very grateful for it, but the original's case is not helped at
</em><br>
all.
<br>
<p>I actually think the back-ups of the future will be tremendously useful--
<br>
even for those difficult 'consciousness sentimentalists' like yourself and
<br>
I.  Here's why:
<br>
<p>Yes, if the whole system suffers catastrophe, we've got a big problem.  But
<br>
back-ups across an individual upload's distributed network of intelligence
<br>
will provide lots of protection from damage.  I tend to hold that the
<br>
consciousness is an emergent awareness resulting from the ongoing operations
<br>
of a plethora of parallel processes (Minsky's society of mind?)  It appears
<br>
redundant and robust enough to survive the critical loss of functionality
<br>
across a signficant percentage of these processes.  Given this state of
<br>
affairs, it will be very nice to have a timely copy lying around for
<br>
on-the-fly re-implantation of corrupted processes.
<br>
<p><p>I'm kind of tired of the purposeless side of this debate (yes the copy is
<br>
you, no it's not, repeat,) and I wouldn't mind more 'collaborative-type'
<br>
discussion to explore the possibilities.  Here's something I find
<br>
interesting:
<br>
<p>You make an exact copy of yourself.  You send him off on his own for 5
<br>
years.  He comes back, and the two of you hook your brains together.
<br>
&nbsp;What's -that- sort of subjective experience going to feel like?  Will the
<br>
two consciousness be able to 'sense' each other, or will they be invisible
<br>
to each other?  Will they, like drops of water on glass, merge upon
<br>
touching?  Obviously this is highly speculative but I am very
<br>
curious/excited about the prospect of consciousness sharing.  (I would feel
<br>
safest doing so with my copy at first.)  (Clearly the means by which the
<br>
connections are drawn is incredibly important in attempting to make any
<br>
determination of the nature of the subjective experience for the two parties
<br>
in question.)
