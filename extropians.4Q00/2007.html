<p>Ah, Barbara, just think what people will say when they are told all these
<br>
fractal robots are in their food:
<br>
&quot;You mean I'm eating them RIGHT NOW?&quot; (extreme distast and fear)
<br>
&quot;Its a conspiracy of the running dog capitalist multinationals to spy on our
<br>
insides and cancel our health insurance before we even know we are sick.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Studies have shown that if you feed 100 lbs of fractal robots to 2 ounce
<br>
laboratory mice, they will develop cancer. Therefore, we should not approve
<br>
their use.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Fractal robots will ride on the corn pollen across fields on the wind to
<br>
milkweed plants and delouse Monarch Butterflys, which is NOT natural. They
<br>
therefore should be banned.&quot;
<br>
&quot;One out of every 100,000 members of the population has a fatally allergic
<br>
reaction to fractal robots, so despite the fact they save 10 out of every
<br>
100,000 lives by reducing spoilage, we should let 10 people die so that one may
<br>
live... thats logical, isn't it?&quot;
