I don't think I need to say much more about this idea than to refer to
<br>
it, buuut:
<br>
<p>Yes, philosophy can solve some useful problems.  Just like art can, in
<br>
principle, serve a useful purpose.  But philosophy as it is commonly
<br>
done is better understood as part of a tradition of &quot;analysis,&quot; into
<br>
which I might include literary critique, much of art history, and some
<br>
cultural analysis, none of which serve some higher purpose.
<br>
<p>This form of analysis is the kind reserved only for those with plenty
<br>
of time on their hands.  (Leisure classes?)
<br>
<p>It is an art in and of itself, and done for much the same reasons.
<br>
<p>You're a better person to the extent that you can appreciate and
<br>
discuss art and philosophy, or at least follow along in such
<br>
discussions.  Things like this aren't useful for doing other things.
<br>
They are what life is worth living for.
<br>
<p>If you don't appreciate philosophy, fine.  I enjoy discussing it.  I
<br>
think it can serve a useful turn or two, but that's really not the
<br>
point.  You should get to know philosophy for the same reason you
<br>
should become familiar with good jazz.  Maybe you won't like it, for
<br>
all of that.  But you'll grow as a person if you do.
