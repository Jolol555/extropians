<em>&gt; &gt; Hmm, so if neobioconservatives hardwire their children for a &quot;natural&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lifespan and add in some genetic diseases to give them a taste of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human condition, we should applaud it? After all, things like that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will increase the range of human variation, and it may turn out that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it is actually a good idea as suggested by one of the futures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sf-stories in Nature, where a massive epidemic wiped out everybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without Tay Sachs-genes). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose that if that future came to pass, then in fact people would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applaud that devotion to genetic diversity in the past.  However from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our present perspective we don't know that this will happen.
</em><br>
<p>Being heterozygote for cystic fibrosis apparently confers an advantage
<br>
against cholera. But if somebody tried marketing a cholera medication
<br>
that as a side effect had the effects of CF (including the much
<br>
shortened lifespan) I guess no agency would approve it and nearly
<br>
nobody would want to take it. There are better ways of treating
<br>
illness. 
<br>
<p>My point above is more about whether we should accept all changes than
<br>
whether a certain change *could* be beneficial. Being born with a
<br>
cross on your forehead (due to parents having odd religious views)
<br>
*could* be beneficial in some circumstances, but most likely not and
<br>
would impose quite a bit on the child.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Taking risks is necessary, but taking unnecessary risks is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; irrational. The same goes for genetic modifications; I really doubt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; many parents would select highly risky treatments for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; children-to-be. That is not really the issue here, but how to handle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the fact that if parents select genes they might create initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conditions that are adverse to the person that later develops. Should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there exist some form of feedback or compensation system so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; children can express their rights once they have become persons? It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not an issue of banning certain forms of radical changes, but rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; making parents aware of the different potential costs of different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; changes. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about a parent who takes his child into space on some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irreversible journey (say, a traditional SF generation ship to the stars)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should children conceived on such a trip be able to sue their parents?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should the children on the Mayflower have sued their parents for exposing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to the hardships of the New World?  I don't think we can categorize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such journeys into necessary vs unnecessary risks.
</em><br>
<p>Isn't this a very different problem?
