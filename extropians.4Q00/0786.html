</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;After quietly listening to the exchange on this topic, I submit this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;notion:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that there is some yet unknown mechanical/genetic explanation for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;homosexuality that is a completely random event.  It comes from inheriting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the genital configuration from one parent and the sexual orientation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from the other, and that the probability of this is about 5% regardless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of other factors.  I have had gay friends tell me they were gay since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;as far back as their earliest memories, cases where twin boys were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;raised identically as far as anyone could tell, yet only one is gay.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;must be something genetic, decided at the moment of conception.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Something striking I remember reading is that the correlation between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homosexuality between two identical twins is almost exactly 50% (if one twin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is gay, his twin has a 50% chance of being gay..) and that for non-identical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twins and for just plain brothers, it is about 25%. This tells me that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence is 50% of genetics and 50% social/environmental/whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (non-fraternal twins share 50% of their DNA - 50% x 50% = 25%).
</em><br>
<p>Actually, this 25%/50% is what you would expect if it were totally genetic,
<br>
since fraternal twins are caused by fertilization of two eggs (which themselves
<br>
have a 50% chance of commonality) by two sperm. This, I think, also suggests
<br>
that homosexuality manifests as the reinforcement of two recessives, one from
<br>
the male, the other from the female. This data would be reinforced if you took a
<br>
group of straights with one of four siblings being gay, and bred them, you'd get
<br>
a 25% output of gay offspring, with 50% having the recessive (assuming that all
<br>
of the parents started out with the recessives. If 33% did not have the
<br>
recessive (which you'd expect from such a Mendel ratio), you'd wind up with
<br>
16.5% gay, 33% straight w/ gay recessive, and 50% straight with no recessive).
