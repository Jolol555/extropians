Remember the saying by Arthur C. Clarke?  Any science/technology
<br>
sufficiently advanced is indistinquishable from magic.  Want to be immortal,
<br>
fly through the air, have food materialize out of thin air, ... ? Through
<br>
science/technology we know we can do these things.  We deliver on what
<br>
religions claim.  
<br>
<p>Truly this isn't supernatural but imho supernatural is simply a
<br>
misunderstanding of where transcendent abilities come from and how they can
<br>
exist.  &quot;Transcendent&quot; being a relative term here rather than being some
<br>
woozy transcending of reality.  It looks like transcending reality to minds
<br>
that have a more limited understanding of what is and is not possible in
<br>
reality.  
<br>
<p>In my opinion we should gather up religious folks and some types of what is
<br>
called &quot;mystical&quot; folks and point out that they don't need pie in the sky.
<br>
They can have real pie.  
<br>
<p>There are many different things that are called &quot;mystical&quot;.  Some of them
<br>
are more philosophical/state of mind/experiental states rather than being
<br>
some claims of transcending reality.  But I would point out that quantum
<br>
mechanics defines reality at its most fundamental level as being quite
<br>
different and even spooky compared to most people's common-sense notion of
<br>
reality.  This doesn't mean it should be used to excuse all kinds of
<br>
weak-minded nonsense as has become trendy among some of the new-age set.

<p><p>The future of science and technology are not mystical, not magick, not
<br>
mysterious.
<br>
A transhuman is not supernatural.
<br>
Capital 'P' Powers are not amazing or incredible, they are merely currently
<br>
inscrutable.
<br>
Mystics read fantasy, extropians read science fiction.
<br>
Get it?
