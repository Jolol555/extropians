Nice stuff.
<br>
<p>Hey, if this is happening to women, what happens to men? We do die younger,
<br>
after all.

<em>&gt; I believe it's been done. But maybe you're thinking of this passage from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; THE LAST MORTAL GENERATION:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ===========
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Menopause marks a change in a body's response to these pituitary messages,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largely because a woman's ovaries are finally depleted of eggs. Unlike
</em><br>
men,
<br>
<em>&gt;  who keep producing spermatozoa all their lives, girls are born with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited supply. Once all the eggs are gone, the ovaries can no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respond to LH and FSH, even in elevated quantities - so other hormones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary for health, chemical messengers formerly made in those tissues,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply dry up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That fact that ova are a finite resource is a reflection of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary history of  human ageing. A human female foetus contains a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; startling seven millions eggs, which are screened and shed in vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profusion during the course of her mother's pregnancy. At birth, the
</em><br>
number
<br>
<em>&gt; of ova in the new-born girl child is down to a million, and the number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeps dropping through life - a quarter of a million at puberty, only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 25,000 by around age 40. When a mere thousand or so remain, the subtle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feedback between pituitary and ovaries starts to shut down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It has been suggested that surgically removing and freezing some of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasted ovary tissue, transplanting it back in late middle age, might serve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to extend the hormonal protection granted to the reproductively able.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed, experiments have shown that implanting ovary tissues from aborted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; female foetuses (which contain, as mentioned, a huge supply of egg cells)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can extend an adult's sexual window. This is regarded by many as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repugnant option, and has been banned in some countries, but the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remains - it is the loss of eggs that activates the doleful cascade of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; menopause, not the other way around.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once that happens, then, a menopausal woman's reproductive hormone system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starts to shut down, and the long-term consequences for the whole female
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body are well-nigh catastrophic. As the least of her problems, fat is laid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down more readily in some places and less so in others, so an older
</em><br>
woman's
<br>
<em>&gt; body is likely to thicken and sag even as her features hollow and wrinkle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Her bones grow brittle. And, for a time, `hot flushes' suffuse the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body as blood suddenly rushes into a woman's surface tissues, trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cool a body confused by the abrupt drop in levels of oestrogen. Luckily,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well-tailored Hormone Replacement Therapy can compensate for many of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncomfortable and injurious side-effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So is menopause a selected, organised change in the human body's dynamic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the growth spurt and onset of sexual maturity in adolescence? Or is
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; something more alarming - a simple failure of one life-support system
</em><br>
after
<br>
<em>&gt; another, driven by the loss of ova, the exhaustion of the ovaries, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequent failure of all the reproductive machinery? Is the female human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body coded genetically to `degrade gracefully', as an engineer might put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, or is post-menopause life just whatever happens after the final page
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; the manual is turned and nothing more is written?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hormone replacement therapy already shows that we can stall some of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncomfortable and damaging changes, although sometimes at a price. [...]
