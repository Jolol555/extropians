<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; Though I admire the depth of vision and imaginative genius on display in
<br>
&nbsp;this work I have many problems with its philosophical underpinnings.
<br>
&nbsp;Broderick, and the scientists he discusses, seem to have little conception
<br>
&nbsp;of old age and death as necessary parts of the human life cycle. This to me
<br>
&nbsp;is the major weakness of the book. It is taken as fact that old age and
<br>
&nbsp;death are evils to be avoided at all costs, that they are in short
<br>
&nbsp;pathologies of the human, diseases, rather than experiences related to
<br>
&nbsp;summarising, relinquishment and moving on. True to the philosophy of
<br>
&nbsp;materialism, the book's analysis centres upon the physiology of ageing and
<br>
&nbsp;death ... &gt;&gt;
<br>
Whew! Rather, toxic in my opinion. Or &quot;just lay back and enjoy it!&quot; as the 
<br>
old, saying went. Wisdom seems to come mostly, from experience, rather then 
<br>
the pile-up of debri in human cells. The materialist culture comment was a 
<br>
bit crazy, since the &quot;spirtual&quot; cannot, as such, be detected; if it were, 
<br>
then the world would appear as something from Larry Niven's &quot;The Magic Goes 
<br>
Away&quot;.  So the choice is to do something or do nothing. If death by aging is 
<br>
so preferable then why work on allieviating Alzheimer's, which is normally 
<br>
age-related? Let the children die of the disease, Progeria, rather then 
<br>
attempt to examine genetic therapy. 
<br>
<p>There are people who may actually disagree with the reviewer, and consider 
<br>
that some of the tasks ahead, that would help humanity and earth-life 
<br>
survive, may (as Arthur C. Clarke has often stated) &quot;take the labour of 
<br>
centuries&quot;. Cleanning up the earth, enhancing its plant-life zones, helping 
<br>
ensure that earthlife survive on terra-formed planets. I understand that many 
<br>
luddites feel the same way as the reviewer, but I feel I shall dismiss him as 
<br>
just another 'Granola-Eater'. 
<br>
<p>If you build the technology, they will come(to paraphrase as movie and a 
<br>
book). Sounds vaguely pornograhic to me.
