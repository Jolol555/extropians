<p><em>&gt;How can we trust any count if it changes every time?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wouldn't we want the count to remain stable?
</em><br>
<p>Presumably.  But having worked with forms (clinical trials) I can assure you
<br>
humans find all kinds of fascinating ways to fill out forms in ways you don't
<br>
anticipate.  When you try to figure it out, the result is that your numbers
<br>
change every time due to judgements calls you're forced to make.  There's
<br>
just no way around it.
<br>
<p>Usually it doesn't matter, we're just dealing with one of those rare cases
<br>
where it does.
<br>
<p>In our case we started out with yes/no boxes for complications.  But some
<br>
doctors would just skip the &quot;no&quot; boxes no matter how much we told them
<br>
not to.  This gave us legally uncompleted forms, so we dropped the &quot;no&quot;
<br>
box .  THEN doctors started skipping the &quot;yes&quot; boxes and putting complications
<br>
in the comments!  So we put in word searches for complication names.  
<br>
Then we run into doctors who wanted to brag about how they *didn't* have
<br>
particular complications (one just loved to list ALL the major complictions, 
<br>
with
<br>
some indication the patient did not have it.)  In the end we had to correct
<br>
most forms ourselves and send them back for signature, often multiple 
<br>
times.
<br>
<p>This is *doctors* dealing with *yes/no* boxes.   What amazes me about the
<br>
Palm Beach business is not that 2% did their ballots wrong but that 98%
<br>
did them right.
