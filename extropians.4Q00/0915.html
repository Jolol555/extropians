<br>
for home protection, they are designed to be compact and easily portable. So 
<br>
I expect you'll be banning them any day now, right?  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get through engineering school I took a job that required me to enter 
<br>
buildings late at night and search them for burgulars.  A handgun is far 
<br>
superior IMHO for that task than any other type of weapon.  This is 
<br>
especially true when passing through a doorway.  It's other utility is that 
<br>
when it is time to quit playing Tom Mix and do some other work, as required, 
<br>
you can put it back into your holster and work.  This is very nice as the 
<br>
question of whether or not the building is truly clear of bad guys is often  
<br>
more than a little ambivalent.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to home protection, if you ever defend your home against a home 
<br>
invader, that has made it inside, you will find that a pistol is again 
<br>
superior to a long weapon.  As your not defending your home against an 
<br>
invader, that has made it inside, the newspapers often carry the stories of 
<br>
the brutality of invaders when no resistance is present.
