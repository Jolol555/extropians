<em>&gt;     &gt; if I delete my mp3 of my favorite Metallica song, I'm fairly certain
</em><br>
your
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; collection will remain unscathed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if I make a copy and send it to you then your collection will be
</em><br>
unscathed too
<br>
<em>&gt; because you'll get the exact same mp3 file back, it is digital after all.
</em><br>
<p>You're dodging the issue.  I'm not disputing that it is a digital
<br>
equivalent.  I'm asking whether they are the SAME thing, or are, instead,
<br>
two instances.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt;&gt;If you have a better definition of death than having a last
</em><br>
thought I'd  love to hear it.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Death = Permanent termination of the experience of reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's exactly equivalent to my definition, except that in my humble
</em><br>
opinion my wording is
<br>
<em>&gt; much better, it doesn't need  a murky concept like &quot;reality&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree that they are equivalent.  &quot;Having a thought&quot; seems to me to be
<br>
the active experience of forming an idea and is, I suspect, a poor model to
<br>
attach to certain life forms.  Or is your definition relevant only to
<br>
humans?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Like being brain dead. I am using &quot;thought&quot; in the broad sense that
</em><br>
includes feeling.
<br>
<p>Well, you can use it in any sense you want John, but you'll admit that
<br>
there's going to be some issues for other people understanding what you're
<br>
talking about if the definition is not commonly held.  Thought includes
<br>
feeling?
<br>
<p>Anyway, this part of our discussion is kind of tangential to our
<br>
conversation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;       &gt;How long is that instant?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Depends of how long &quot;now&quot; is, probably second or two for most people.
</em><br>
<p>Your contention is that there is a one or two second period in which both
<br>
entities would, in fact, be basically one?  Why?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;      &gt;Is there an actual effective reality in which  they are all &quot;me?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Depends of which &quot;me&quot; your talking about, the &quot;me&quot; of a year ago, the &quot;me&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the instant the copy was made, or the &quot;me&quot; of after the copy.
</em><br>
<p>Your insistence on using the same word to refer to each of the copies is
<br>
unnecessarily imprecise.  If you don't like original and copy, can we call
<br>
them One and Two (etc...)?  In that context, let me rephrase: is there an
<br>
actual effective reality in which copies 2 through 10 are, in fact, One?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; In what -scientific- fashion is one of the brains simultaneously
</em><br>
doing what
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; you describe above, and what possible substance does it have?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huh?
</em><br>
<p>You appear to making the claim that my copies are not discrete-- that there
<br>
is some sort of shared experience across the entities.  I'm asking for the
<br>
scientific basis by which you hold this belief.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; By what science does my subjective experience mysteriously jump
</em><br>
across to
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; the clone?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Something can't &quot;jump&quot; unless it occupies space (Where is the number
</em><br>
eleven?)
<br>
<em>&gt; and it's debatable if consciousness even has a position in space,
</em><br>
<p>Space is a BIG issue with regards to consciousness-- we're talking about
<br>
discrete entities, remember?  My brain is separate from yours-- we have
<br>
differing experiences of reality.  It -matters- that our disparate brains
<br>
don't have hardware connecting them; that their relationship is non-local.
<br>
It appears to be your contention that the discrete conscious subjective
<br>
process that is One will somehow have access to (or become???) the discrete
<br>
conscious subjective process that is Two.  I would like to hear your
<br>
explanation of how this 'transference' might take place (the movement or
<br>
transformation of the subjective experience of One into Two.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;     &gt; Why is it important that the copy was made within a single
</em><br>
nanosecond?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because I can have a thought in 60 seconds. If the copy was made a 60
</em><br>
seconds
<br>
<em>&gt; ago and then I'm hit by a bus then I've had a last thought  and so the
</em><br>
&quot;me&quot; after the
<br>
<em>&gt; copy was made is dead, and I wouldn't like that at all.
</em><br>
<p>Your logic is fraying.
<br>
<p>Let's try a little diagram.  This is the subjective experience of One:
<br>
<p>1:  --------|  &lt;splat&gt;
<br>
<p>with the horizontal axis representing the passage of time, the dashes
<br>
representing subjective experience (your life up until now) and the pipe
<br>
representing the point of termination (the bus of our thought game.)  In
<br>
what EFFECTIVE fashion does ANY external copying event alter this particular
<br>
subjective experience?
<br>
<p>It -appears- to be your belief that if we create an instantaneous copy at
<br>
the moment of termination:
<br>
<p>1:  --------|
<br>
2:              |--------
<br>
<p>that the subjective experience that is One, will somehow be uninterrupted.
<br>
I'm curious to know:
<br>
<p>a) By what scientific principle is the discrete experience of One affected
<br>
in any way by the initiation of Two?  (Or, for that matter, ANY other
<br>
external copying event?)  To put it another way: How does One &quot;know&quot; about
<br>
Two?  Is there some sort of quantum magic going on here?
<br>
b) You appear to believe that if the switch isn't (practically)
<br>
instantaneous, then someone dies.  How do you reconcile this belief in the
<br>
face of a harsh reality that would seem to dictate a (non-trivial!) period
<br>
of time to scan your information and reconstitute it elsewhere?
<br>
<p>Further, why -should- time be a factor?  If the copy REALLY is you, and you
<br>
get hit by the bus 60 seconds later, then all you've lost is 60 seconds.
<br>
You had a 60 second old back-up made.  Yes, there IS a minute of subjective
<br>
experience lost to the mists of antiquity, but, hey, Two isn't going to know
<br>
about that.
<br>
<p>Or let's pretend that a *second* copy is made, just as the bus hit you.  Is
<br>
the second copy (Three) -more- you than the first? (Two)  Since Three was
<br>
made at the moment of your death, is Three now the vessel for your
<br>
subjective experience?  What about Two?
<br>
<p>Is death of One a necessary component of the success of Two?  You seem to
<br>
think that if we kill One -instantaneously- when we make Two, its okay, but
<br>
if One dies -later- that's a bad thing.  By that logic, we should ALWAYS
<br>
KILL ONE (at the moment of copying)-- it saves you having to die down the
<br>
road.
<br>
<p>All these ideas regarding multiple copies, etc, are confusing only if you
<br>
hold that there is some sort of continuity of subjective experience going on
<br>
here.  Frankly, I don't find any of this confusing at all-- we're making
<br>
clones (xoxes?); they're separate people; if anything bad happens to them,
<br>
that's a bad thing (for them.)  I don't think that -timing- makes it okay to
<br>
kill One!
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;     &gt; Let me get this straight:  is it your contention that my discrete
</em><br>
experience
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; of reality will, at the instant of impact, jump across to the (just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; activated) copy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A loaded question. If your experience is and always will be &quot;discreet&quot;
</em><br>
then obviously
<br>
<em>&gt; I can't make another, but I've yet to find a scrap of evidence indicating
</em><br>
that is true.
<br>
<p>Discrete, not discreet... my subjective experience is definitely discrete,
<br>
but not always discreet... :)
<br>
<p>I'm not quite sure why this is a loaded question.  I never said that my
<br>
experience always will be discrete-- only that it currently is.  Since most
<br>
of us (except for the telepaths... damn you telepaths!  Get out of my mind!)
<br>
have discrete experiences of reality, I think the burden of proof is on you
<br>
to show that a shared or transmitted experience of reality is going to occur
<br>
under conditions of copying.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;     &gt; there's got to be *something* making that mystical jump across into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; the new substrate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed there is but it's not mystical, it's information.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly, and there's more than just information at stake here.  Information
<br>
is good-- it tells you exactly how I am to be built.  But we don't care
<br>
about just the information, we also care about the reality of the instance.
<br>
The information of the precise composition of the Brooklyn Bridge is NOT the
<br>
Brooklyn Bridge.  It only becomes a bridge when we build it.  And once we
<br>
build it, we no longer care about the information again.  We care about the
<br>
reality of the instance of a bridge.  *I* care about the reality of this
<br>
instance of *me.*  You might use my data to create another instance, but
<br>
that process is irrelevant to the first particular instance of the
<br>
implementation of that information in reality.  I am not -just- information.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;As far as I'm concerned, -you're- the one who believes in a human
</em><br>
soul
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're the one claming this huge difference between &quot;The Original&quot; and
</em><br>
&quot;The Copy&quot;.
<br>
<p>Actually, I don't claim a huge difference at all.  I think that Two will be
<br>
an &quot;exceedingly precise (nearly exact) copy&quot;  It will be a second instance
<br>
of the implementation of my information in reality and will be totally
<br>
similar to myself in every way.  It will be *another* Jason.  It just won't
<br>
BE the first Jason.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Something must cause the difference, what is it, what does one have that
</em><br>
the other does not?
<br>
<em>&gt; It can't be matter, science can tell no difference between one hydrogen
</em><br>
atom and another,
<br>
<p>Are two separate hydrogen molecules the same hydrogen molecule?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;and
<br>
<em>&gt; if you're right and it's not information either then it can only be
</em><br>
something beyond the scientific
<br>
<em>&gt; method, the soul.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it might be beyond -current- scientific method (for now) but that's
<br>
not because I think it's mystical!  Intelligence is a tricky animal, that's
<br>
all.  We are representative of the finest, most complicated self-adaptive
<br>
emergent process in reality, of which we are currently aware.
