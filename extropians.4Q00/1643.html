The following article makes a more plausible argument than I would
<br>
have thought possible that private choices fail to put sufficient
<br>
weight on the future.  The paper does note, however, that governments
<br>
seem to place even less weight on the future that private parties do.

The Social Discount Rate
<br>
Andrew Caplin, John Leahy
<br>
NBER Working Paper No. W7983 Issued in October 2000
<br>
<p>In welfare theory it is standard to pick the consumption stream that
<br>
maximizes the welfare of the representative agent. We argue against this
<br>
position, and show that a benevolent social planner will generally place a
<br>
greater weight on future consumption than does the representative agent. Our
<br>
analysis has immediate implications for public policy: agents discount the
<br>
future too much and the government should promote future oriented policies.
