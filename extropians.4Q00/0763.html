<p><p><em>&gt; I wonder why you are concerned with Deiicide(sp) and how it relates to modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life? If the concept of God is gone from humanity, do you expect that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who believe will not take up some other nonsense? Will you be safer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the missionaries, will sociry be more sensible and humane? Are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rebelling against Jesus, Jerry Fallwell, the Buddha, Pagans, whom? All? Just
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; To me, the essence of Nietzsche is that he was a destroyer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of the boxes within which people are intelligent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  In his attempt to destroy religious boxes, he said &quot;God is dead!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and got his message onto the cover of Time magazine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Many religious people are highly intelligent... within their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  religious boxes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Max Stirner ('The Ego and its Own') was, in my opinion, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  more penetrating box-destroyer than Nietzsche. He essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  said, &quot;You need to go beyond killing God, you need to destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the very notion of &quot;god&quot; (so-called), the very idea of &quot;god&quot;; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  word &quot;god&quot; needs to become no more than a nonsense-noise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to you.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Nietzsche also attempted to destroy political boxes:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;There are still peoples and herds somewhere, but not with us,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  my brothers: here there are states.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The state? What is that? Well then! Now open your ears, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  now I shall speak to you of the death of peoples.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The state is the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly it lies, too;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and this lie creeps from its mouth; 'I, the state, am the people.'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It is a lie! It was creators who created peoples and hung a faith
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and a love over them: thus they served life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It is destroyers who set snares for many and call it the state:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  they hang a sword and a hundred desires over them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Where a people still exists, there the people do not understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the state and hate it as the evil eye and sin against custom and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I offer you this sign: every people speaks its own language of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  good and evil: its neighbor does not understand this language.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It invented this language for itself in custom and law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But the state lies in all languages of good and evil; and whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it says, it lies -- and whatever it has, it has stolen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Everything about it is false; it bites with stolen teeth. Even its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  belly is false.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Confusion of the language of good and evil; I offer you this sign
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of the state. Truly, this sign indicates the will to death! Truly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it beckons to the preachers of death!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Many too many are born: the state was invented for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  superfluous!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Just see how it lures them, the many-too-many! How it devours
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  them, and chews them, and re-chews them!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ...It would like to range heroes and honorable men about it, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  new idol! It likes to sun itself in the sunshine of good consciences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  -- this cold monster!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It will give you everything if you worship it, this new idol: thus it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  buys for itself the luster of your virtues and the glance of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  proud eyes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It wants to use you to lure the many-too-many. Yes, a cunning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  device of Hell has here been devised, a horse of death jingling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  with the trappings of divine honors!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Yes, a death for many has here been devised that glorifies itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  as life: truly a heart-felt service to all preachers of death!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I call it the state where everyone, good and bad, is a poison-drinker:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the state where everyone, good and bad, loses himself: the state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  where universal slow suicide is called -- life.&quot; [emphasis added]
</em><br>
