<p>
I think the problem here is that people mix up mysticism,
<br>
spirituality, magick and the supernatural.
<br>
<p>Mysticism is the epistemological position that some truths can or must
<br>
be grasped by direct insight, not empirical thought.  Spirituality is
<br>
about meaning, the core values that we have. It doesn't have to
<br>
involve any spirits.  Magick, as defined by Crowley, is merely the art
<br>
and science of causing change according to will - i.e. it encompasses
<br>
both technology, ordinary skills and magic.  Supernatural denotes
<br>
stuff that behaves according to rules outside not just current
<br>
understanding of the universe but apparently against it.
<br>
<p>(These are quick-and-dirty definitions with no warranty, if people
<br>
want to go on debating using them they better look up better versions
<br>
of them)
<br>
<p>Now, how do these fit together with transhumanism and extropianism?
<br>
<p>Mysticism claims that mystic insight delivers important truths. It has
<br>
a bad track record of delivering useful practical information like
<br>
physical laws or natural constants (it should not be mixed up with
<br>
creativity, where a random insight is then tested against reality and
<br>
possibly adapted, such as the Kekule benzene structure idea). A lot of
<br>
&quot;mystical science&quot; is just analogical thinking, a happy chant of &quot;look
<br>
how elegant and neat it all fits together!&quot; that doesn't lead
<br>
anywhere. What mysticism seems good at is delivering a sense of
<br>
meaning and emotional significance to stuff (be it the universe or a
<br>
single leaf).
<br>
<p>Transhumanism is out to improve the human condition using efficient
<br>
means. This implies that mysticism does not provide much help in
<br>
building the devices or techniques we need or want. Where it may be
<br>
helpful is on the emotional level, in getting a feel for how wonderful
<br>
the universe is or how we ourselves fit in with it. Extropian-wise,
<br>
Practical Optimism and Rational Thinking implies that we should not
<br>
place blind faith in any revelation, but rather test it against
<br>
reality. Maybe it turns out that mysticism can be physically useful,
<br>
but it better prove itself.
<br>
<p>Transhumanism and extropianism are often spiritual in the sense I
<br>
defined it above. Our drive towards progress, self-transformation,
<br>
optimism, self-direction etc. have a spiritual component - they are
<br>
meaningful and important to us. Here spirituality in a transhumanist
<br>
context would be the cherishing and development of these values, our
<br>
increased understanding of what we want and believe and how this fits
<br>
in with the rest.
<br>
<p>Magick in the Crowley sense is trivially transhumanist - we want to
<br>
cause change, and we want to use the best available means to do so. In
<br>
the stronger sense of involving something supernatural, then we get a
<br>
collision with the rational views embodied in the extropian principles
<br>
and transhumanist declarations. Being rational we seek to minimize the
<br>
discrepancies between our reality models and observed reality, and
<br>
this means that in the long run all supernatural stuff will either
<br>
become natural (we figure out how it fits with a better reality model
<br>
- either as an unusual effect of the earlier models or by being
<br>
included as an irreducible part of the new model) or vanish (it did
<br>
not exist in the first place or was just misinterpreted). Clarke's
<br>
law, you know.
<br>
<p>In the short run time, money, attention and intelligence are of course
<br>
limited and we should spend them in an efficient manner - not every
<br>
claim warrants great expenditures to be understood (here the benefits
<br>
of a distributed and individual approach seems to work well, let
<br>
people spend their own resources on whatever research they think will
<br>
be profitable). 
<br>
<p>To sum up, transhumanism has spiritual values, but these are not based
<br>
on any supernatural assumptions. Mysticism may reinforce or refine
<br>
them, but it is not regarded as the sole way to truth. Transhumanism
<br>
seeks efficient means of causing change fitting these values, and does
<br>
this from a practical empirical approach. Merely assuming that
<br>
something works is not transhumanist, but testing that something works
<br>
and then investing in it depending on how reliable the effect appears
<br>
to be, is.
