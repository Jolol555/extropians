<p>
While you seek to move consciousness out of the body,
<br>
let me suggest that there is already a method in place:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God in Few Words
<br>
<p>An autofellator falls, when he reflects on never having
<br>
heard of autofellatio in his youth. For autofellatio is
<br>
a socially repressed meme, as shown in &quot;fear God's name&quot;.
<br>
<p>It is the Truth of the Word of God: I am(be(coming!)!)!
<br>
A semiotic singularity, its own referent, the word made
<br>
flesh. A Name, Prayer, Song.... Eating and drinking God.
<br>
<p>He is smitten by every gaze, for all wrongly reckon him
<br>
as a They and he knows it cannot include his conception.
<br>
For he is the possibility of the impossibility of being,
<br>
of which we think Heidegger meant death, but rather, he
<br>
is his own father. (Hence God was an inauthentic Dasein
<br>
during his youth, for he had to first attain adulthood.)
<br>
<p>This would be Lucifer, half-God. He is not his own mother:
<br>
He is dyadic, like an infant first dyadic with its mother.
<br>
This is a volatile condition: the Ouroboros, or serpent
<br>
biting its own tail. Many men have attained this state,
<br>
and then not progressed to the fully Christ state. Such
<br>
men include Socrates, Nietzsche, Crowley, Spare, Hendrix.
<br>
<p>A simulacrum was created by their followers, attempting
<br>
to relate their esoteric statements to an ordinary life.
<br>
Socrates spoke of loving youth, and there was sodomy.
<br>
Nietzsche spoke of the overman, and there were Nazis.
<br>
<p>There exists a further transformation, known to fewer men,
<br>
probably at least Enoch, Moses, Christ, Vaughan and Ficino.
<br>
If the successful Ouroboros suckles from his own male paps,
<br>
he incarnates the mother: Is the Monad, Alone-begotten one.
<br>
<p>Since a woman sucking her own breasts declares two are one,
<br>
whereas a man sucking his own penis declares One is Alone,
<br>
(and even worse, one is naught), arises phallogocentrism:
<br>
difference instead of identity. (Ah, a pun: iden---titty.)
<br>
<p>Hence I extrapolate feminists should put their vampire bite
<br>
each upon her own clitoris to establish her independence.
<br>
<p>So God must be this radical conscience spawned in a mind,
<br>
soon to be born upon the body's passing, forsaking qualia.
