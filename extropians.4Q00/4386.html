</em><br>
<p>No mistake. A government is a corporation, a non-profit corporate
<br>
association.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Governments enjoy a power monopoly over a territory ultimately using weaponry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I fail to see corporations doing that on their own, except maybe in parts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Latin America where U.S. companies have used that technique (with the approval
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the local fascist government, I might add).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those who define governments as corporations make a special version of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age-old Thoreau argument on social contracts. Except for people who leave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one state to become subjects of another I know of nobody having written a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social contract. How can one allow one's forefathers to write a social contract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in stone, as it were?
</em><br>
<p>The state constitution is the social contract. If you accept being a
<br>
citizen, you accept that contract. You may not like some parts of it,
<br>
but you accept it or you leave. The only point of contention is what
<br>
constitutes uncoerced acceptance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No. States simply consist of local power monopolies giving some people the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power over some territory. The &quot;us vs them&quot; syndrome of human behaviour.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If one idealizes states as corporations, then one should also idealize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mafias and mobs of this world as such. Power monopolies can allow themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make any discrimination against the subjects of their power monopoly.
</em><br>
<p>Mafias and mobs are in and of themselves corporate organisms, though
<br>
they are not officially organized as such, but since they also typically
<br>
only engage in their monopoly of force within their own ranks (and
<br>
punish those who violate this rule), they only need to be internally
<br>
recognised as such. Just because a government is a monopoly of force
<br>
does not mean it is not a corporation that is engaged in monopolizing
<br>
the market of force. Just because it engages in that market does not
<br>
mean it permanently monopolizes it without contest. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One could argue that you wrote about *U.S.* govnerment and that the laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (esp. one called &quot;constitution&quot;) allow you to bear arms and theoretically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overthrow the government in case it goes &quot;bad&quot;. In practice, you can forget
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that pipe dream. You may have your rifles, but when the opposition has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much larger arsenal of weapons, technology, and people you lose. Irak had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a large force (the 4th largest, if memory serves) but lost hard. Why would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any small group win over the U.S. Government, given those statistics?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just wanted to add my USD 0.02 to point out some contradictions in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your belief system.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't accept that its impossible to reform our government by
<br>
force of arms, and having studied a bit of military history, for a
<br>
number of years, I stick by that statement. However that has nothing to
<br>
do with the assertion that a government is a corporation of a non-profit
<br>
association type.
