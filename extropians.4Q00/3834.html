<p><em>    &gt; Everyone involved in this discussion is flailing about hopelessly
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;because M.V.T. is the correct (thus only) solution to the mind-body
</em><br>
problem.
<br>
<p>Even overlooking the fact that there is little evidence supporting the idea
<br>
this
<br>
pineal gland business is a bit old fashioned isn't it. I don't see how it
<br>
could
<br>
answer any of the questions we've been asking even if it were true.
<br>
<p>* Your first mistake, Median Vision Theory (MVT) is concerned
<br>
with the pineal EYE rather than the gland.
<br>
* The evidence is quite substantial, including studies on the functions of
<br>
pineal eyes of living vertebrates by Dendy, Roth &amp; Roth and many others.
<br>
* The pineal eye was on the front cover of Nature magazine (1994 I think)
<br>
because of unique depolarizing properties and other recent studies. My
<br>
own formulation of MVT dates back to 1979/80, agreed, but has been
<br>
updated in response to new evidence (PhD &amp; MA, 1993-5 &amp;c.), so I don't
<br>
think it is &quot;old fashioned.&quot;  Are you discarding knowledge because it
<br>
predates year 2000?
<br>
<p><p><em>    &gt; It is very obviously and indisputably true that any circuit (brains
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;included)  *must* include at least some infinite-state capacity in
</em><br>
order to
<br>
<em>    &gt;self-organise.
</em><br>
<p>It most certainly is not obvious and I do dispute it.
<br>
<p>OK, but you are arguing against fairly elementary solid-state physics.
<br>
Name me any finite-state components that can readjust their logic in
<br>
response to the environment  ..... I say you can't because finite-state
<br>
means
<br>
pre-set switching. Consciousness requires a degree of self-organisation.
<br>
<p>I await your counter arguments. If you want, I can reference you papers.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; &quot;consciousness&quot; [...]  happened in evolution only since the pineal eye
</em><br>
disappeared.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;ou seem very sure of that but, forgive me for asking, how do you know when
</em><br>
animals
<br>
<em>&gt;first became conscious? For that matter, how do you know I'm conscious?
</em><br>
<p>I don't want to get bogged down in semantics here .... so I claim that REM
<br>
(rapid eye
<br>
movement) indicates dream mentation. REM occurs only in warm-blooded
<br>
animals.
<br>
Warm bloodedness only occurs in E-1 (lost pineal eye) animals ... this is
<br>
fact.
<br>
If behaviour is governed by hard-wired response to sunlight (E-2) and no REM
<br>
occurs, I claim the animal is not *fully* conscious in the way we (mammals &amp;
<br>
birds)
<br>
are conscious. Sure, you can make a case for teleology in insects, even
<br>
robots, but
<br>
this is just lingoistic whinging ... I am interested in *our* type of
<br>
consciousness and
<br>
how it came about.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; End of discussion
</em><br>
<p>Well it's really nice that now we know all there is to know about
<br>
consciousness.
<br>
Only trouble is you've put a lot of philosophers out of work and they can be
<br>
a mean
<br>
bunch when they get liquored up late on Saturday night, so be careful.
<br>
<p>Hardly a problem ... sure, there is a whole (old fashioned!) mystery
<br>
industry ...
<br>
priests and mumblers of all types, not just philosophers. But we are post
<br>
(or at least trans- ) humans, and should welcome reduction of the failed
<br>
human-era traditions? The Mystery Industry is mere vested interest that
<br>
profits by keeping humans in a state of unknowing.
<br>
<p>And they should be more worried about meeting me on a Saturday night ....
