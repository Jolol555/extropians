<p>
I read &quot;The Cassini Division&quot; by Ken MacLeod over the weekend.  I couldn't
<br>
find any mention of it in the archives at <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/</a>
<br>
though I think I recall some discussion here once.
<br>
<p>It was well written (or maybe it had been too long since I'd read SF and I
<br>
needed a fix).  People like us are clearly the bad guys in the book, but it
<br>
was interesting to see what our worse crimes are from MacLeod's perspective.
<br>
<p>MacLeod seems to favor some sort of socialist society, though he was never
<br>
very clear how it worked.  He is, however, able to depict an
<br>
anarcho-capitalist society, and it isn't a terrible place -- just culturally
<br>
backward and unsophisticated.
<br>
<p>**** SPOILER WARNING - I'm going to say what happens! ****
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>The people in his socialist society think uploads are just machines without
<br>
any inner life worth considering, but the main character of the book
<br>
eventually get temporarily uploaded and then realizes that she is wrong
<br>
about this.
<br>
<p>It seems that according to MacLeod, our great crime is selfishness. When
<br>
Earth was in bad shape, the people in space split into two factions,
<br>
&quot;beautiful people&quot; who had lots of sex and wanted to help Earth, and
<br>
&quot;outwarder&quot; nerds who only cared about conquering the universe for selfish
<br>
glory.  At some point the outward faction violently grabs a bunch of
<br>
resources, kills lots of the others, and uploads more of them to serve as
<br>
slaves.  They go off to Jupiter, take apart a moon, create millions of
<br>
upload copies to do their dirty work, become huge million-mind-equivalent
<br>
creatures, and build a wormhole.
<br>
<p>They then get stuck in virtual reality navel-gazing, and broadcast viruses
<br>
that destroy all computers and telecom on Earth, forcing Earth to from then
<br>
on use mechanical computers and no radio. Earth folk are about to destroy
<br>
them all, but then try to talk, and find creatures on Jupiter that seem
<br>
reasonable.  Earth asks them to stop the viruses, and asks them to explain
<br>
how to use the wormhole to get to a distant colony of anarcho-capitalists,
<br>
and the Jupiter folk do both.
<br>
<p>Many groups in the anarcho-capitalist colony then decide they want trade
<br>
with Jupiter and send ships there through the wormhole, ignoring Earth-folk
<br>
warnings about the viruses.  Viruses from somewhere on Jupiter then take
<br>
over those ships, which is then a justification for killing all life/mind
<br>
on Jupiter.
<br>
<p>So MacLeod's bottom line is that we're right about that technologies like
<br>
uploading and wormholes and anarcho-capitalism can work as envisioned, but
<br>
that our selfishness will do us in.  It makes us get stuck in navel-gazing,
<br>
and when we are powerful it makes us so irresistibly grabby that others
<br>
will get together to kill us all.  When we stay as weak humans we create
<br>
societies that work, but are culturally unsophisticated.
<br>
<p>I suppose the image is similar to that of the Ferengi in Star Trek NG,
<br>
&quot;ugly, greedy and sexist&quot; traders -- useful to have around, but not the
<br>
sort you'd want to socialize with, or have sex with, and definitely not
<br>
the sort you'd want to allow to have substantial power.  Which if you
<br>
think about it is the stereotype of the nerd.  And all this fits with
<br>
my theories of why people don't like cryonics, and why they aren't
<br>
thrilled with our becoming superhuman.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately these stereotypes do have a basis in reality.  People
<br>
on this list do on average give the impression to outsiders of being
<br>
less sexy, less culturally sophisticated, more selfish, and more caring
<br>
about things and stuff out there than people around here.  And ordinary
<br>
people do seem to have deeply ingrained fears of letting such people
<br>
have power.
<br>
<p>My response to all this is not to deny stereotypes regarding values,
<br>
but to deny that the facts will make them very relevant.  The common
<br>
SF scenario is a small group of people who have a huge influence over
<br>
history and society, usually via their access to technology, and whose
<br>
values are pivotal to the outcome.  But this has almost never happened
<br>
in the past, and isn't likely to happen in the future either.
<br>
<p>Most change is due to large broad social forces, and organizations
<br>
large enough to have substantial power over others are controlled by
<br>
coalitions of many types of people, with many types of values.  SF
<br>
scenarios where a few nerds could take over the world with the tech
<br>
(AI, nanotech, wormhole, etc.) that they develop in their obscure lab
<br>
are just fantasy.
<br>
<p>Selfish techie nerds are and will remain largely powerless, even
<br>
if all the changes we forsee and promote come to pass.  We may be
<br>
pivotal in making people pay attention to these possibilities, but
<br>
if they happen after that it will be because of social forces and
<br>
widely shared values - our differing values won't matter much.
