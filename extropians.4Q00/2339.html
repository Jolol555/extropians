<em>&gt; This is in error, the vote in a number of states was close enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to warrant a recount. The reason it's only taking place in Florida
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is because Florida has a law insisting on a recount if the vote is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within a certain percentage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Look for other states to pass such laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Gore camp didn't like the results of the recount (because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still lost) hence the current situation.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, Gore doesn't have anything to do with this situation.  Florida law
<br>
mandates or authorizes SIX counts of votes to occur.  Everything that has
<br>
happened in Florida is specifically prescribed by law.  Even the recounts,
<br>
hand-counts, voter lawsuits and judicial review of the vote is all going
<br>
according to the plan described by our lawmakers.  Only Bush's lawsuit tried
<br>
to deviate from Florida law, and it was denied.  This is how the election is
<br>
supposed to occur under Florida law when the vote is this close.
<br>
<p>COUNT ONE:  EXIT POLLING
<br>
Our state law allows news media to conduct exit polling and to announce the
<br>
results of the exit polling when the majority of counties have closed their
<br>
polls.  We have two time zones.  After the majority of our polls were closed
<br>
in the eastern timezone, the exit polls clearly showed Gore ahead by 20,000
<br>
or so votes.  The exit polls projected Gore to be the clear winner, and this
<br>
is what was reported by all the new media.
<br>
<p>COUNT TWO:  MACHINE COUNT
<br>
Our state law requires all votes to be counted and reported.  This produced
<br>
the first indication that the computers were not recording the vote the same
<br>
way as the exit polls.  The news media moved Florida back into the
<br>
too-close-to-call column.
<br>
<p>COUNT THREE:  MACHINE RECOUNT
<br>
Our state law requires that all votes be recounted if the initial count
<br>
shows the top two candidates to be within one-half of one percent of each
<br>
other.  This triggered the first round of recounts.  This also forbids the
<br>
original count from being certified as official.
<br>
<p>COUNT FOUR:  SAMPLE HAND COUNT
<br>
Our state law allows any candidate to call for a recount if the final count
<br>
is close or if the accuracy of the machine counts is questioned.  Gore
<br>
requested this recount on both grounds in four counties.  It is not only
<br>
possible, but is specifically allowed by law.  In the case of questioning
<br>
the accuracy of the machine counts, the law specifically authorizes hand
<br>
counts to check the machines.  To save work, the county is allowed to
<br>
perform an initial hand-count of a small sample to test the machines.  This
<br>
is the first hand-count.
<br>
<p>COUNT FIVE:  COMPLETE HAND COUNT
<br>
If the above hand count shows a dramatic difference between what the
<br>
machines report and what the humans count, the election officials have the
<br>
authority to call for a total hand count.  This occurred in Palm Beach
<br>
county.  They said that they found so many votes that were not counted by
<br>
the machines, that a hand count was warranted.  Broward county had the
<br>
opposite result.  They hand counted two-thirds of one percent of their
<br>
votes.  They found four votes that were not counted by the machines.  They
<br>
decided that this was not enough of an error to warrant a hand count of all
<br>
the votes.
<br>
<p>COUNT SIX:  ABSENTEE BALLOT COUNT
<br>
The final count occurs on Friday when the absentee ballots come in.  These
<br>
votes must be counted at that time, and the votes must be added to the
<br>
totals.  The final total for the whole state cannot be certified until then.
<br>
The initial certification on Tuesday can be used to lock in existing votes,
<br>
but cannot prevent new votes from being added as they get counted.  This
<br>
will be the final count authorized by Florida law.  Any numbers reported
<br>
before this sixth count cannot be certified as official under Florida law.
<br>
<p>All of these counts have and will occur because of Florida law.  Gore had
<br>
not interfered with our normal election process yet.  Bush is tried to
<br>
overturn our local laws, but failed.  The Palm Beach lawsuits are
<br>
specifically allowed by law which even goes so far as to allow the judge to
<br>
reallocate the vote if it does not accurately reflect the intent of the
<br>
voters.  Everything down here is going according to plan.  The country
<br>
should just be patient and wait.  We are not the only state that is
<br>
recounting.
