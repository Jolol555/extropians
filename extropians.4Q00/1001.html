</em><br>
<p>Which I see every day, which is part of what prompted this thought.  I
<br>
know computers, and have at least a basic understanding of what one can
<br>
do with them.  I even work in an ecommerce firm that's trying all kinds
<br>
of new technologies.  My co-workers could do their jobs better, and thus
<br>
make the company (and, through our stock options, themselves and myself)
<br>
richer, with even a fraction of my understanding of the company's
<br>
systems than without.  I attempt to impart this understanding where the
<br>
benefit becomes significant (for instance, to marketers who write
<br>
requirement specifications totally at variance with reality), but am
<br>
occasionally faced with a lack of understanding as to why I'm telling
<br>
them this - even when I spell out my reasons in plain English.
<br>
<p>I understand my job, and though I am not an expert in what they do, I at
<br>
least try to understand their jobs.  I have even done parts of their
<br>
jobs, on occasion as necessary (for instance, defending the customer's
<br>
point of view in engineering meetings).  They make no such apparent
<br>
effort in return.
<br>
<p>It has gotten to the point where I have taught otherwise non-technical
<br>
people the basics of programming, such that they can write simple &quot;Hello
<br>
World&quot; programs...and, more to the point, simple utilities that increase
<br>
their productivity.  But I can only teach the willing; the others simply
<br>
stare, uncomprehending, at the increased productivity and free time that
<br>
those I have taught gain.
<br>
<p>And it is far from just programming.  For instance, marketers are
<br>
supposed to be on top of what our competition is doing and planning how
<br>
we can beat them, and yet, according to the executives, it is I who sees
<br>
almost the majority of useful ways we can extend our services, both in
<br>
new features and in new markets.  (And this is in a company of over 100,
<br>
not counting contractors.)  Though, to be honest, I suspect they're
<br>
counting innovations I merely inspire others to think up.
<br>
<p>In short, the possibility I outlined at the start of this thread is but
<br>
a major exaggeration of the world I personally face today.  I do not
<br>
take this as proof that the Singularity has already started, but it is
<br>
tempting to do so.  Main fact weighing in favor: the Singularity is, if
<br>
I understand it correctly, the point where no one can make reasonable
<br>
predictions about the future.  Already, most of my friends have given
<br>
up trying to predict their personal lives, or what tech will be
<br>
available, even one or two years ahead.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What might happen is of course that the posthumans (or people of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new economy or whatever) want to make sure people staying behind do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this due to their own values as a rational decision, rather than just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due to mistaken information, habit or something else. Hence they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to give an unbiased image of what they are missing out on (here I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will just assume ethical posthumans; posthumans with an ideological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axe to grind is another matter of course). Education becomes very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant.
</em><br>
<p>But, unless one can comprehend the way forward, how can one not have
<br>
mistaken information about it?  And if those who choose not to advance
<br>
do (or seem to) universally not truly comprehend the way forward, how
<br>
can one disprove that it is the lack of comprehension itself which
<br>
causes people to stay behind?
