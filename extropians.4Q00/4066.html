<p><em>&gt; Jeremy if I could turn back the clock the one thing I would've done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as far as school is concerned is I would have taken more business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classes.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I agree with you, Brian, about taking business classes. I took
<br>
a number of business classes at the University of Texas and have also
<br>
started and operated businesses. I learned much more about business by
<br>
actually engaging in it than by studying about it. Unless your goal is to
<br>
get a job with a person or organization that requires business classes as an
<br>
admission ticket, I'd advise you to start a business in order to learn about
<br>
business (and even if you DO need a business degree as a ticket, it's still
<br>
good to get some practical experience). You don't need a huge amount of
<br>
capital in order to do this, and it can be done &quot;on the side&quot; without
<br>
completely disrupting the rest of your life. Keep your eyes and ears open
<br>
for things or services people need that you could provide. As far as I've
<br>
been able to determine, the same general economic principles apply to both
<br>
tiny and huge businesses. A lot of the stuff they teach in university
<br>
classes is based on unrealistic assumptions, some of it's pure BS; but out
<br>
on the streets you gain practical wisdom which you can put to use in
<br>
real-life situations. With respect to summer jobs, internships, and so
<br>
forth, IMO most &quot;management trainee&quot; jobs in large companies teach social
<br>
skills but not how to run businesses (not to say that social skills aren't
<br>
extremely useful).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Go to a discount bookstore and find a copy of &quot;The millionare next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; door, or the millionare mind&quot; this weekend and start reading. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may help re-inspire you.
</em><br>
<p>Another good book is _Rich Dad, Poor Dad_.
<br>
<p>As far as non-business classes to take, I'd suggest sampling as many things
<br>
as possible. You may find something that ignites your interest. When I was
<br>
in school I found that my mind seemed sharper if I took at least one math
<br>
course each semester. Even now I find that I can think more clearly if I
<br>
spend at least half an hour each day engaged in mathematical play.
<br>
