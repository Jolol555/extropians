<p>&lt;&lt; One problem with that argument- you're not the book, and we have never
<br>
&nbsp;experienced dissolution (in our present forms, anyway), so we cannot take
<br>
&nbsp;this argument any further.  The most significant issues in life cannot be
<br>
&nbsp;resolved through objective, empirical arguments- they can only be resolved
<br>
&nbsp;through experiencing them from within.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;I am not my brain.  I am not the data within it.  The I is the I that is not
<br>
&nbsp;I.  It makes sense when you start to meditate on it...

Look, when I had an operation (an easy one) I believe the anesthesiologist 
<br>
gave me atropine ( i guess) and the world didn't disappear, but Popped* back 
<br>
to reality. For that time, I ceased to be, or so it seems to me. No memory, 
<br>
recollection, no hallucinations--just a discontinuity. I don't remember going 
<br>
under, only the visual shift  of position indicated that anything had 
<br>
happened from the instant before. I am not sure that human consciousness can 
<br>
exist except on something that behaves exactly like a human body, including 
<br>
the brain and nervous system. Hopefully there will be computers and networks 
<br>
and even some kind of omega point or substrate that exists; that we can be 
<br>
reconstituted on.
