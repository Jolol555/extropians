<p><em>&gt; &lt;&gt;  Would it be possible to actually use the ISS as a &quot;construction base&quot; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects such as assembling translunar or interplanetary vehicles?  This
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; pulsing the ACS jets toward the solar panels.  I gather that once the Big Rig
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of solar panels is in place that final docking will be accomplished by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capture with the station's big arm, to cut down on final correction firing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the shuttle's ACS.  With that delicacy in mind, is it practical to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about having a lot of hardware being moved around anywhere near the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;completed&quot; ISS?  If not, would there still be savings in doing work based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the ISS, but &quot;commuting&quot; a short distance to a work site in some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small &quot;taxi&quot; vehicle?
</em><br>
<p>I'm no expert &quot;space cadet&quot; but it seems to me a  better design would
<br>
have been to put the solar cell array (or better) external to the
<br>
working station and beam the power to the station.  Especially if the
<br>
power generation mechanism is quite delicate.  Perhaps the station could
<br>
beam power to smaller working shacks? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&gt;  What are the cost/benefit factors effecting creation of a fuel depot near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the station for use by other vehicles.  This always seemed to be an inherent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; element of the Original Plan (c. 1955 - i.e. the one I was weaned on).  I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; envision low-cost, specialty tankers, perhaps Big Dumb Boosters, for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose of ferrying fuel into LEO.  I realize that using lunar resources at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Moon makes the most sense for getting energy there, but does a fuel depot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in LEO at or near ISS or something like it make sense?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>AFAIK it would make a lot more sense to process near-earth asteroids for
<br>
fuel (and construction materials and other worthwhile volatiles) than to
<br>
try to do anything like that from lunar resources.  And it would be a
<br>
lot cheaper than hauling all the fuel up from earth.  Of course there is
<br>
a bootstrapping problem of getting enough stuff &quot;up there&quot; to extract
<br>
fuel and other goodies from local space rocks.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&gt; What about using ISS as a base for an on-orbit satellite retrieval and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repair service?  I've envisioned an unmanned &quot;tug&quot; vehicle, based at the ISS,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to make the transit from LEO to GEO, for the purpose of placing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satellites into GEO, or of retrieving hardware from anywhere within that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regime.  Targets could be brought back to ISS for servicing there, or for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; packing into relatively &quot;dumb&quot; reentry shells to be shipped groundside for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; servicing.  Are there decent economics in this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Much more economical if you have the fuel to do the work and a series of
<br>
useable vehicles that stay in orbit for the purpose.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CAVEAT: All of this is near term stuff and I know that flinging monkeys into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space doesn't make a lot of sense in the long run.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It may not make sense in the short run if instead we can set up robotics
<br>
to build some of the infrastructure needed to support monkeys in space. 
<br>
As I'm sure many know we need to set up some economically viable and
<br>
lucrative space activities to justify sending many monkeys up.  I vote
<br>
for local asteroid mining myself.  Cheaper than going to the moon. 
<br>
Richer variety of materials than can be had from the moon.  Able to be
<br>
fairly well automated.  Tons of very high grade ore, fuel, building
<br>
materials and volatiles for the taking.  The trick is to get enough up
<br>
that to tap that first rich rock in order to fuel more and to start a
<br>
space gold (well not exactly gold per se) rush.
