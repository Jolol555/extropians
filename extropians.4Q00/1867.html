I would prefer a 100% chance of getting $1,000,000 to a 50% of getting 
<br>
2,001,000. This could be explained either by saying that I am risk averse 
<br>
or by saying that there is a diminishing marginal utility of money for me. 
<br>
Is there a way of distinguishing these explanations or are they 
<br>
fundamentally saying the same thing?
<br>
<p>We might try to answer this question by considering goods that purportedly 
<br>
don't have a diminishing marginal utility, such as units of pleasure. 
<br>
Suppose I prefer a 100% chance of getting 1,000,000 hedons to a 50% of 
<br>
getting 2,001,000 hedons. Does this then show that I am truly risk averse? 
<br>
But how do we know that there is not a diminishing utility of hedons? (Not 
<br>
to mention the difficulty of measuring hedons.)
<br>
<p>Maybe we can approach the issue by considering goods that have different 
<br>
rates of diminishing marginal utility. The marginal utility of hamburgers 
<br>
decreases very rapidly - after one or two I really don't care to get any 
<br>
more. The marginal utility of money decreases more slowly - almost any 
<br>
imaginable sum would still leave me wanting more. Risk aversion, on the 
<br>
other hand, is not supposed to be relative to goods. So risk aversion would 
<br>
be what remains when we have factored out the specific diminishing marginal 
<br>
utility of the good we are considering. The problem is knowing when we have 
<br>
factored out all the diminishing marginal utility. Maybe we could define 
<br>
risk aversion as the factor by which our choices deviate from getting the 
<br>
greatest expected quantity of good x, where x is the good which has the 
<br>
least diminishing marginal utility. But what would x be? Something like 
<br>
wish-granting-power? How would that be quantified? Wish-granting power 
<br>
doesn't come in natural units like kilograms or $$. You could say that one 
<br>
unit of wish-granting power is the power to grant one wish. But how does 
<br>
one individuate wishes? (One couldn't permit wishes that asks for more 
<br>
wishes, or wishes that are conjunctions of arbitrarily many &quot;sub-wishes&quot;.)
<br>
<p>[Wild idea: Could we say that a basic wish is the power to determine the 
<br>
true answer to a random one-bit question?]
<br>
<p>Maybe we'll have to stick to money as the best approximation to such a 
<br>
&quot;pure good&quot;. But then it seems we should forego speaking of diminishing 
<br>
utility of money. Only stuff like consumption of hamburgers would have a 
<br>
diminishing marginal utility, and it would be measured by how much less 
<br>
money we are willing to pay for eating an additional hamburger.
<br>
<p>A common intuition is that, other things equal, a more even distribution of 
<br>
money is better. But rather than grounding this in diminishing utility of 
<br>
money, one would have to justify it by appealing to risk aversion. Perhaps 
<br>
one could tell some sort of veil-of-ignorance story to that end.
<br>
<p>Alternatively, we could seek to reinterpret all talk of risk aversion as 
<br>
talk about diminishing utility of money. Is there any reason why this would 
<br>
not be an attractive option?
