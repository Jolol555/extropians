<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  We can do these things and more (including resurrecting dead
<br>
ancestors) given a few assumptions:
<br>
<p>1) that it is possible to extract the &quot;you&quot; as a pattern of informaiton
<br>
and such from your body;
<br>
<p>2) that some future technology enables not only this but time travel
<br>
such that it is possible to come to this point in space time rather than
<br>
some variant created by the time-travel itself;
<br>
<p>3) that these future uber-geeks decide to record the patterns of all
<br>
humans of the period.
<br>
<p>Insert anything else of interest in the place of your consciousness
<br>
above.  Tipler and company had (iirc) a super super computer
<br>
autogenerate all possibilities including ourselves.  But that is a dumb
<br>
way to acheive such effects.  Time travel and patern extraction, storage
<br>
and replay abilities will do the trick nicely.  
<br>
<p>I get a bit freaked reading books of myths and mysticism at how much of
<br>
what is presented as miraculous in those works could be acheieved with
<br>
sufficient technology. Sometimes I have the nagging suspicion that some
<br>
of these myths and legends grew out of a memory of more advanced
<br>
technology and capabilities that our distance forbears somehow had some
<br>
run-in with.  Wouldn't it be a hoot if it turned out that this very
<br>
world is already chock full of something a level or two more complex
<br>
than nanotech or that it is a complex VR and that it is only usably
<br>
accessible to those &quot;mystics&quot; who get beyond their single-self ego
<br>
boundaries enough not to be a huge danger to themselves and others if
<br>
they could make use of some of its possibilities?  
<br>
<p>Pure speculation to be sure.
