Another interesting story from &quot;Living to 100&quot;.
<br>
<p>Interested in finding out how much of longevity might be attributed
<br>
to genetic components the researchers searched for families of long
<br>
lived persons.
<br>
<p>They were informed by other researchers that this was unlikely
<br>
because then current wisdom had any genetic involvement at being
<br>
the result of thousands of genes.
<br>
<p>The researchers in fact found a picture in the paper of a man
<br>
celebrating his 108th birthday. Looking over his shoulder was his
<br>
103 year old sister! They also had a 97 year old sister and
<br>
informed the researchers had they arrived two years earlier they
<br>
could have talked to two other sisters aged 101 and 102.
<br>
<p>The researchers then found two other such families. This pointed to
<br>
the possibility of a few genes rather than many.
<br>
<p>Now the REALLY interesting part &quot;There was a strong likelihood of
<br>
family intermarriage by cousins in two of the three families.
<br>
Intermarriage has often been associated with the development of
<br>
harmful inherited diseases....We may have found a mirror-image case
<br>
in which a positive trait, that of extreme longevity has emerged as
<br>
a result of intermarriage. This discovery reinforced our belief
<br>
that a small number of genes-perhaps fewer than 10-might be
<br>
responsible for extreme longevity in the R family.&quot;
<br>
<p>Shades of the Howards huh? Somebody get Robert a grant.
<br>
<p>Back to the book.....
