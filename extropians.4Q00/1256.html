&quot;Human Immortality Is Achievable By The Year 2029,&quot; Proclaims Ronald Klatz,
<br>
M.D., Pioneering Biotech Guru And Founding Physician Of Anti-Aging Movement
<br>
<p>&nbsp;CHICAGO, IL -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 10/02/2000 -- In the October 2000 issue
<br>
of Anti-Aging Medical News, an official scientific newsletter servicing a
<br>
physician readership in excess of 50,000 worldwide, Dr. Ronald Klatz, Senior
<br>
Fellow at Tufts University, President of the 10,000 member American Academy
<br>
of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M, Chicago, IL), and inventor/administrator of
<br>
more than 100 US biotech patents, advances his longstanding thesis that life
<br>
expectancy projections based on pastcast models will be quickly abandoned in
<br>
favor of a new forecasting projection of longevity that focuses on five
<br>
emerging technologies which, taken collectively, will be the singlemost
<br>
important innovation that delivers boundless vitality to humankind within
<br>
the next three decades.
<br>
<p>Dr. Klatz's authoritative report on the future of human life expectancy
<br>
debunks pessimistic claims of a predetermined and finite limit to human
<br>
lifespan as advanced by S. Jay Olshansky, demographer at the University of
<br>
Illinois at Chicago. Olshansky, whose statistics-centered, non-clinical
<br>
research is underwritten by the National Institute of Aging, is part of an
<br>
arcane and ineffective movement seeking to squelch the voice of
<br>
forward-looking physicians and scientists who embrace cutting-edge medical
<br>
and biotechnological advancements that will help us to achieve human
<br>
immortality. Olshansky, who since 1990 has clung to historical statistical
<br>
analyses purporting that the elimination of cancer, heart disease, and
<br>
diabetes would increase life expectancy only to about age 85, and would
<br>
proliferate disabling conditions such as arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and
<br>
vision and hearing losses in advanced age, is now contradicted by a highly
<br>
reputable and objective source. In a new study published by the prestigious
<br>
Science magazine (Sep 29 2000: 2366-2368), &quot;Increase in Maximum Life-Span in
<br>
Sweden, 1861-1999,&quot; we learn that in Sweden, the maximum age at death has
<br>
risen from 100 years during the 1860s to about 108 years during the 1990s.
<br>
The study's authoring team, demographers J. R. Wilmoth and L. J. Deegan of
<br>
the University of California/Berkeley along with H. Lundström, and S.
<br>
Horiuchi, acknowledge that &quot;an intensification of efforts … to prevent or
<br>
even cure ailments such as coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer&quot; has
<br>
profoundly contributed to &quot;the more rapid rise in the maximum age since
<br>
1969.&quot;
<br>
<p>In &quot;Making the Quantum Leap to Human Immortality in the Year 2029&quot; appearing
<br>
in the October 2000 issue of Anti-Aging Medical News, Dr. Klatz advances the
<br>
concept of The Longevity Link, a novel representation of the impact of five
<br>
key biomedical technologies on gains in human longevity.
<br>
<p>According to Dr. Klatz's LEx Equation, medical knowledge and technology
<br>
doubles every 3.5 years and gains in human longevity are directly
<br>
proportional to the cumulative sum of advancements in the biotech fields of:
<br>
stem cells, giving rise to a supply of human cells, tissues, and organs for
<br>
use in acute emergency care as well as treatment of chronic, debilitating
<br>
disease:
<br>
<p>cloning, a technique holding tremendous promise in producing consistent
<br>
organs, tissues, and proteins for biomedical use in humans
<br>
<p>nanotechnology, enabling scientists to use tiny tools to manipulate human
<br>
biology at its most basic levels
<br>
<p>artificial organs, making replacement body parts available
<br>
digital cerebral interface, a technology to transfer one's thoughts, sensory
<br>
perceptions, emotions, personality, and autonomic body responses -- to
<br>
computer storage device, enabling your memories and consciousness to survive
<br>
in the event of your physical death
<br>
<p>Says Dr. Klatz, &quot;The accelerating biotech revolution leads us to the
<br>
incontrovertible conclusion that human immortality -- lifespans beyond 120
<br>
years -- may well be delivered by the year 2029. The arrival at the Ageless
<br>
Society is believed by leaders in the government, commercial, and private
<br>
sectors to be the salvation and solution to the healthcare crisis in
<br>
America.&quot;
<br>
<p>As a registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization, the American Academy of
<br>
Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M) is the only non-profit, non-commercial, medical
<br>
society in the world devoted to eradicating the degenerative diseases of
<br>
aging. Since its inception seven years ago, the A4M has been the first and
<br>
only scientific nonprofit medical society to have forecast the deliverance
<br>
of human lifespans in excess of 100 years. The 10,000 physician, scientist,
<br>
and health practitioner members of the A4M are forging a profound healthcare
<br>
paradigm shift that alleviates the mounting social, economic, and medical
<br>
woes otherwise anticipated to arrive with the rapidly growing volume of an
<br>
aging population. The A4M sponsors The World Health Network, the Internet's
<br>
#1 anti-aging portal, at www.worldhealth.net, as part of its mission of
<br>
promoting advocacy and awareness of this new clinical science.
