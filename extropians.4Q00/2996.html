Subject: WTL: Enlightenment: universals; new essays; Veatch; mp3
<br>
<p><p>New Essays:
<br>
<p>Scholars intending to present and defend papers at the Enlightenment
<br>
Annual Meeting were required to provide several samples of their work,
<br>
including one substantial essay and two new critiques of material
<br>
available somewhere on the web. I've published several of these
<br>
submissions in the last few days and will be continuing to get more
<br>
material published over the next week or so. You can find the
<br>
announcements on the front page. People interested in attending the
<br>
meeting may begin sending application materials immediately; see the web
<br>
site for instructions.
<br>
<p>The Online Conference is tentatively scheduled for January 20-21.  The
<br>
submissions for this conference are being evaluated and published at this
<br>
time. Please look for announcements on the front page.
<br>
<p>Universals:
<br>
<p>Enlightenment's Analytic discussion list has been critiquing chapters 5
<br>
and 8 of Carolyn Ray's doctoral dissertation, IDENTITY AND UNIVERSALS.
<br>
We have now begun more direct discussion of chapter 3, &quot;Universals&quot; and
<br>
will continue with this topic until winter break.
<br>
<p>Since some people on Atlantis and OWL have commented on the dissertation,
<br>
members of those lists might be interested to know that they and anyone
<br>
else are welcome to join the list and observe or actively participate in
<br>
this discussion.  Though anyone is welcome to submit posts for
<br>
consideration, it is asked that everyone keep in mind that the purpose of
<br>
the list is to assist professional philosophers by providing a forum in
<br>
which they can receive critiques useful to the development their theories
<br>
and written works. The list is strictly moderated by Bryan Register for
<br>
content, quality, and relevance, and the standard is generally graduate-
<br>
to professional-level. And, as the name of the list implies, we're mostly
<br>
doing analytic philosophy there. Most of the active participants
<br>
explicitly use the method of objectivity to approach problems and handle
<br>
objections.
<br>
<p>Posts will all be available in the web archives, but since updating must
<br>
be done by hand, they do not appear immediately. They are, however,
<br>
public; so people who are not interested in joining the list are free to
<br>
read them at something of a delay. 
<br>
<p>(Note: I won't be actively participating in discussions of the topic that
<br>
have been occurring on the wetheliving lists, as I'm spread a bit thin as
<br>
it is and have a prior commitment to Analytic. Don't let that stop you.)
<br>
<p>Veatch:
<br>
<p>The Veatch discussion has been postponed until after winter break, due to
<br>
widespread difficulties in obtaining the out-of-print but
<br>
still-copyrighted text. We are currently seeking contributors willing to
<br>
write chapter summaries to start the discussion of each chapter of
<br>
INTENTIONAL LOGIC; please let list owner Bryan Register know that you are
<br>
interested when you subscribe.
<br>
<p>The mp3 version of my TOC Summer Seminar 2000 talk, &quot;How To Win
<br>
Arguments,&quot; which targets the kinds of reasoning errors made by, at, and
<br>
among Objectivists, is available for free download. CD's will be burned on
<br>
demand and may be purchased for $5.00 US.
