<p>
Well, Spike's discussion about Interstellar Dust and the need to
<br>
figure out just what our capabilities would be if we could enshround
<br>
the Sun and collect all of its power output led me to get off my
<br>
lazy butt and crunch some numbers.
<br>
<p>The assumptions I started with were the Project Daedalus mission
<br>
which was a carefully studied effort to design in interstellar
<br>
flyby probe for surveying nearby solar systems.  The mission
<br>
parameters were a total flight time of 40 years, 500 tons
<br>
of dropoff payloads (survey satellites), 1000 ton dry
<br>
mass, 2 stage fusion starship with ~150,000 tons of Deuterium
<br>
and Helium-3 as fuel.  The energy produced to accelerate this
<br>
ship to 0.16c was ~1.64*10^12 Tons of TNT (6.8*10^26 J) using
<br>
an inertial fusion reactor (similar to the National Ignition
<br>
test facility currently being built at LLNL).
<br>
<p>For comparison purposes the Space Shuttle weighs ~200 tons
<br>
empty and ~2000 tons fueled.  The International Space Station
<br>
will be about 100 tons when it is completed.
<br>
<p>I changed things slightly by assuming you would build solar
<br>
system infrastructure (mass drivers or lasers) to provide
<br>
power for launching the ships.  The results are quite interesting.
<br>
The sun gives you enough power that you could launch 300 fueled
<br>
ships a second (fueled because you want to use the fuel to decelerate
<br>
at the destination).  That would allow you to launch the entire
<br>
Earth's population into interstellar space in less than a year
<br>
(at 1 person per ship!).  And you still leave behind the solar
<br>
system in much the same condition as you found it.  You probably
<br>
need to dismantle a small fraction of the moon for the material
<br>
to build the ships (1.5*10^18 kg) and has has been previously
<br>
discussed in my Planetary Dismantlement paper, you only need a small
<br>
fraction of Mercury or the moon to enshroud the sun in solar cells.
<br>
Though if the Solar System Green Party has its way you probably
<br>
have to dismantle the solar cells and mass drivers on upon
<br>
leaving the system so it can remain as a pretty &quot;natural&quot; star.
<br>
<p>So, the next question is what if you don't want to send probes
<br>
with people on them.  What if you want to send automated probes
<br>
until you run out of material...  Well that picture is *very*
<br>
different.  Even using 100% of the Sun's output it still takes
<br>
you 300 million years to fire off all the material you have
<br>
available to construct ships from.  So, you can move entire
<br>
planetary civilizations relatively quickly but moving all
<br>
the mass of a solar systems takes a long time.
<br>
<p>Now, of course this brings us to the missing mass question.
<br>
It would appear that if the launches are done via solar
<br>
sails or mass drivers, then you are not going to leave
<br>
hot thrust production signatures outside of the starting
<br>
system or the destination system.  Minimal energy requirements
<br>
for single individuals are around probably around a hundred watts,
<br>
perhaps adding some computer support (you can talk to Hal for
<br>
the 40 years it takes), maybe pushes you to a few thousand watts.
<br>
Radiate that much heat over a fairly large surface area and it is
<br>
going to be very difficult to notice.  If you have uploaded into a
<br>
nanocomputer before the start of the trip, you simply put yourself
<br>
in a big box of lead to shield yourself from the cosmic rays and have
<br>
the ship reboot you after a specified time period.  Very low
<br>
power consumption indeed.
<br>
<p>Now, lets say a galaxy gets to the ~ Kardashev Type III level and
<br>
they decide they all want to throw a party.  Maybe Kieth Henson's
<br>
infamous &quot;Far Side&quot; party.   They tell everyone to meet at such
<br>
and such a location at such and such a time (perhaps a million
<br>
years in the future due to the long interstellar travel times
<br>
required).  Now what happens on the day of the party is you have
<br>
100 million trillion single person ships (give or take a few orders 
<br>
of magnitude) decelerating and opening communication channels within
<br>
a single solar system.  Things may get tight, accidents may happen,
<br>
but boy if you survive, what a rush!  And that my friends just might
<br>
be what astronomers refer to as an Extragalactic BL Lacertae object.
<br>
<p>Robert
<br>
<p>P.S. For those unfamiliar with BL Lacerte objects, from the
<br>
GCVS (General Catalog of Variable Stars):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;...compact quasistellar objects showing almost continuous spectra
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with weak emission and absorption lines and relatively rapid irregular
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;light changes with amplitudes up to 3 mag in V or more.  Sources of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;strong X-ray radiation and radio waves, their emission displays strong
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and variable linear polarization in the visible and infrared spectral
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;regions.&quot;
