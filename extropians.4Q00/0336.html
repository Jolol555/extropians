Oh, my. He has entrapped me, your Honour.
<br>
<p>Seriously, you know recombinant DNA technology? Very useful for all
<br>
kind of things: pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, agriculture, nowadays
<br>
even gerontology. Even more goodies in the future. Alas, also handy
<br>
for badass bioweapons. Same technology, different use. Some good, some
<br>
bad. One is saving a sick little girl from leukemia, other is giving
<br>
her a roaring case of Ebola. Quite different, don't you agree?
<br>
<p>So is molecular circuitry. No uploads without. Unfortunately, also
<br>
very handy for &gt;H AI. I think playing Rabbi Loew before uploads are
<br>
there is irresponsible, since suddenly confronting us with beings of
<br>
potentially vastly larger fitness. I don't think uploads are nearly as
<br>
dangerous because of their limited initial kinetics, and &quot;eternal
<br>
life&quot; does have a ring, so that sounds worthwhile. You think I'm full
<br>
of it, and you're in posession of the single truth telling you the
<br>
risks are worth the chances, so let's just agree to
<br>
disagree. Hopefully, both of us are wrong, and the tight spot isn't
<br>
nearly as tight as it appears.
