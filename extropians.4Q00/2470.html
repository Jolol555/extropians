<p>
Of course, extropy has been called a cult before, usually by trolls,
<br>
much like yourself.  As there is no particular OTHER reason to call
<br>
extropianism a cult, (as I'll attempt to show), usually they fall back
<br>
on calling us dogmatists, which, I have to presume, is what you were
<br>
driving at in your parody of an extropian calling deep-ecologists &quot;the
<br>
DEVIL.&quot;
<br>
<p>As I've said before, no extropian is my leader.  None of them tell me
<br>
what to do, or what to believe.  I've disagreed with Max More, for
<br>
example, time and again.  I'm sure I will in the future.
<br>
<p>I think he and I agree that there is not only a non-trivial chance of
<br>
apocalyptic disaster in the next century, (a possibility which
<br>
everyone became aware of around the time of the cold war,) but also a
<br>
chance of unprecedented wealth, longevity, and, dare I say it,
<br>
happiness.  Neither of these possibilities is inevitable, though I
<br>
think they're quite likely outcomes of the next century or two.
<br>
<p>But it is in holding these beliefs *tentatively*, and in not allowing
<br>
our beliefs to be determined by a leader or any other person, that we
<br>
demonstrate our rationality (in particular, our rejection of dogma).
<br>
We are not cultists or dogmatists of any other kind.
<br>
<p>I don't know much about Gnosticism.  I do know that typical Gnostics
<br>
have tended to prioritize the &quot;spiritual&quot; realm over the &quot;physical&quot;
<br>
realm.  I rather doubt most extropians would agree with that.
<br>
<p>Being &quot;apocalyptic&quot; is in the spirit of Gnosticism (along with many
<br>
other religions), but there are plenty of obvious reasons why you
<br>
might expect *something* big to happen in the next century.  For one
<br>
thing, our weapons have gotten drastically bigger.  The potential for
<br>
doom at our own hands is so obvious that it's hardly worth mentioning.
<br>
For another, our population is still growing exponentially, with all
<br>
of the benefits and drawbacks that entails.  Finally, Moore's law,
<br>
along with what we already know about physics and computer science,
<br>
seem to suggest that our creations will begin to get very interesting
<br>
as we learn more and more about how to make our computers faster.
<br>
<p>However, most Gnostics also hold that gnosis, a special kind of arcane
<br>
knowledge, is what you need to survive apocalypse.  While I think most
<br>
of us agree that you can make yourself more powerful if you know more,
<br>
knowledge by itself won't make you better off.  I rather doubt that
<br>
there will be a mystic quiz at the end of time; if anybody here DOES
<br>
think that, I rather doubt they believe that this is view is
<br>
particularly relevant to extropy.
<br>
<p>So, we are neither cultists, nor Gnostic.  Make of that what you will.
<br>
