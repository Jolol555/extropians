This is the press release which Shell is putting out, to announce the 
<br>
winners of the essay competition.  There was an announcement based on this 
<br>
press release on page 19 of the Oct 21-27 issue of The Economist.
<br>
<p>Bill
<br>
<p><p>Prize-winning thinking.
<br>
Winners announced for 'The World in 2050' writing
<br>
competition run by Shell and The Economist.
<br>
<p>The Economist and Shell are pleased to announce the
<br>
winner of this international writing competition,
<br>
which was launched in April 2000.
<br>
<p>The aim of the competition was to encourage debate and
<br>
thought about the social, political, environmental,
<br>
technological and economic issues that countries,
<br>
companies and individuals will face in the middle of
<br>
the 21st century.
<br>
<p>William Douglass, age 28, from Houston, Texas beat
<br>
more than 3000 entrants from 75 countries with his
<br>
essay 'Dear Nestor'.  The essay takes the form of a
<br>
letter written by a young Bangladeshi boy to a friend
<br>
in the USA in a world governed by 'The Network' where
<br>
oil rigs are obsolete, and special genes and limited
<br>
duration marriages are the norm.
<br>
<p>The judges chose Mr Douglass's entry because of the
<br>
connection made between advances in technology and the
<br>
unchanging importance of human relationships.
<br>
<p>Bill Emmott said: &quot;We liked this essay not only
<br>
because it was compellingly written in an accessible
<br>
form, but also because it artfully included ideas both
<br>
about how life and people might change, and about
<br>
things which might endure.&quot;
<br>
<p>The competition was judged by a panel of experts
<br>
chaired by Richard O'Brien, Partner of Outsights (the
<br>
international consultancy in external change and
<br>
strategy).  The panel included Esther Dyson, an e-guru
<br>
and investor; Peter Warshall, a biologist and
<br>
environmentalist; Matt Ridley, a science writer, most
<br>
recently of &quot;Genome&quot;, a much-acclaimed book; Wolfgang
<br>
Michalski, a futurist at the OECD; Jusuf Wanandi, an
<br>
Indonesian academic specialising in strategic studies;
<br>
Bill Emmott, editor of The Economist; and Sir Mark
<br>
Moody-Stuart, chairman of the Committee of Managing
<br>
Directors of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
<br>
<p>William Douglass will receive a prize of US$20,000 and
<br>
his essay will appear in The Economist's annual
<br>
publication, &quot;The World in 2001&quot;, published in
<br>
November 2000.  Two second prizes of $10,000 are
<br>
awarded to Paul Gordon and Robert Carlson, and five
<br>
third prizes of $5,000 go to Peter Baker, Alain
<br>
Boxhammer, Paul Copeland, Peter John and Martin Smith
<br>
Sir Mark Moody-Stuart said: &quot;What has been impressive
<br>
about this competition is the range and scope of
<br>
entries.  From space exploration through to
<br>
environmental sustainability, it is clear that there
<br>
are common themes of concern and debate that are
<br>
shared across the world.  As well as offering
<br>
congratulations to the prizewinners, I'd like to say a
<br>
big thank-you to everyone who made the effort to share
<br>
with us their vision of what the world will be like in
<br>
2050.&quot;
