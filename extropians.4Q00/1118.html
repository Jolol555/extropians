My father was quite interested in manned space flight and science and
<br>
technology in general and supportive of my interest in science even my
<br>
ventures in pyrotechnical chemistry when I was quite young.
<br>
<p>The rules were simply not to blow myself up or get my girlfriends pregnant.
<br>
<p>Of course this may be relative. While still supportive, they are not too
<br>
happy that I am gay (although they have treated my lovers like members of
<br>
the family) and were definitely not happy when I got a motorcycle. So
<br>
transhumanism is not a big thing to them. Although, I brought up the subject
<br>
of being frozen when it was clear my fathers cancer was terminal and he
<br>
decided to pass in it. My father wanted to live to see the day men landed on
<br>
Mars and time was running out for him unless he was placed in suspension.
<br>
<p>Best Ralph

<em>&gt;Hi all!

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;After reading so many posts about parent's reactions on their children's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interests, I feel so lucky to have my Mom. About the same time I became
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Transhumanist, she was honestly interested in what I was interested in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And became a Transhumanist herself. Now she sits for hours in front of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;her computer, reading all messages from the German Transhumanist Group
</em><br>
<em>&gt;DE:Trans. And she hopes her English will become better, so she can read
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Extropians, too. She was and still is the only female person I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;talk with about Sysop scenarios, cryonics (she's a member of CI, too)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and uploading.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But I don't think my Mom's the only Mom that doesn't dislike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Transhumanist ideas. I would be very interested to hear about your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experiences with your parents or other family members.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If this question has been brought up earlier already, I apologize for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;repeating it.
