<p>
With the successful completion of STS-92's on-orbit work at the International 
<br>
Space Station, I'm prompted to some musings on that growing stack of 
<br>
hardware.  As long-time list denizens know, I'm an Apollo-era space-junkie, 
<br>
and can't help but be both happy and a little bemused at the landmark of the 
<br>
shuttle's 100th flight and ISS's being very near &quot;Phase I&quot; completion.
<br>
<p>The Original Plan (i.e the von Braun-Ley vision that was hard-coded into my 
<br>
psyche as a preschooler looking at LIFE magazine) called for step-by-step 
<br>
development of space: First a winged, reusable orbiter, then a LEO station, 
<br>
then the Moon, then Mars; all of which would be done by &quot;about now&quot;, i.e. the 
<br>
turn of the century.  Well, the Cold War saw to the fact that things got 
<br>
taken out of order, and the funding slump following Vietnam saw to it that it 
<br>
took 20 years to get from the reusable winged orbiter to the first station, 
<br>
in the US program, at least.
<br>
<p>So what do we have with the ISS? Cold War aftermath dictated building the ISS 
<br>
in a very high inclination orbit.  This has lead me to wonder about a number 
<br>
of questions:
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt; How much of a delta-v penalty does the STS pay in reaching that high 
<br>
inclination?
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt; How much of a delta-v penalty will a launcher starting from a more 
<br>
sensible equatorial base have to pay to reach the current ISS orbit?
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt; Suppose someone actually uses the ISS for one of the primary original 
<br>
purposes envisioned in the Original Plan, i.e. as a construction and 
<br>
maintenance base for further space infrastructure, such as a reusable 
<br>
translunar vehicle, planetary transit vehicles and the like.  How much 
<br>
penalty is imposed by its current orbit?
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt; Suppose things change in the future and it makes sense to move the ISS to 
<br>
a more equatorial orbit.  Will the propulsion system the final version will 
<br>
have be able to make that move?
<br>
<p>Beyond these questions of &quot;location, location, location&quot;, I also wonder what 
<br>
the more professional space cadets here think of the ISS's prospects for 
<br>
serving as a useful platform for expanding space infrastructure might be.  
<br>
For instance:
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;  Would it be possible to actually use the ISS as a &quot;construction base&quot; for 
<br>
projects such as assembling translunar or interplanetary vehicles?  This 
<br>
question is prompted by the extreme caution I know is used when the shuttle 
<br>
gets close to the ISS even in its current configuration, in terms of not 
<br>
pulsing the ACS jets toward the solar panels.  I gather that once the Big Rig 
<br>
of solar panels is in place that final docking will be accomplished by 
<br>
capture with the station's big arm, to cut down on final correction firing of 
<br>
the shuttle's ACS.  With that delicacy in mind, is it practical to think 
<br>
about having a lot of hardware being moved around anywhere near the 
<br>
&quot;completed&quot; ISS?  If not, would there still be savings in doing work based 
<br>
from the ISS, but &quot;commuting&quot; a short distance to a work site in some kind of 
<br>
small &quot;taxi&quot; vehicle?
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt; Do back-of-the-envelope calculations support the idea of using ISS as a 
<br>
base for building other space hardware?  By this, I mean are the savings in 
<br>
having a &quot;construction shack&quot; in place sufficient to justify using it for 
<br>
this purpose?
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;  What are the cost/benefit factors effecting creation of a fuel depot near 
<br>
the station for use by other vehicles.  This always seemed to be an inherent 
<br>
element of the Original Plan (c. 1955 - i.e. the one I was weaned on).  I can 
<br>
envision low-cost, specialty tankers, perhaps Big Dumb Boosters, for the 
<br>
purpose of ferrying fuel into LEO.  I realize that using lunar resources at 
<br>
the Moon makes the most sense for getting energy there, but does a fuel depot 
<br>
in LEO at or near ISS or something like it make sense?
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt; What about using ISS as a base for an on-orbit satellite retrieval and 
<br>
repair service?  I've envisioned an unmanned &quot;tug&quot; vehicle, based at the ISS, 
<br>
able to make the transit from LEO to GEO, for the purpose of placing 
<br>
satellites into GEO, or of retrieving hardware from anywhere within that 
<br>
regime.  Targets could be brought back to ISS for servicing there, or for 
<br>
packing into relatively &quot;dumb&quot; reentry shells to be shipped groundside for 
<br>
servicing.  Are there decent economics in this?
<br>
<p>Ultimately, I wonder how expandable the ISS architecture is.  Clearly, the 
<br>
PMA &quot;node&quot; design allows for a modular extension in a lot of directions.  I 
<br>
know Spacehab has a couple of designs they're pushing for some nice 
<br>
accommodation modules, including the truly cool inflatable hab module.  
<br>
Obviously, crewing is limited to the lifeboat capacity, which is 3 until 
<br>
Rutan's bird flies, when it will be 7 per ACRV.  Docking two ACRVs could 
<br>
bring the crew up to 14.  Could the current ISS platform be grown that much?
<br>
<p>CAVEAT: All of this is near term stuff and I know that flinging monkeys into 
<br>
space doesn't make a lot of sense in the long run.
