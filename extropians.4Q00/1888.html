<p>
Wow.  You step away from the list for a few weeks, and a discussion
<br>
like this one pops out.
<br>
<p>It is, IMO, ridiculous to explain the existence of an interest rate by
<br>
virtue of the fact that I'd rather have pleasure today than tomorrow.
<br>
(I'll ignore the case where preferences are satisfied without my
<br>
knowing it and lump preference satisfaction together with &quot;pleasure.&quot;)
<br>
The standard argument claims that, since I prefer pleasure more today
<br>
than tomorrow, and since I'm rational, I'd refuse to trade away
<br>
today's pleasure for tomorrow's pleasure, unless tomorrow's pleasure
<br>
was sufficiently greater than today's pleasure.
<br>
<p>This argument is wrong, because, if rational, it seems I'd also rather
<br>
have pleasure yesterday than today, which is false.  I WOULD rather
<br>
have $1M 20 years ago than $1M today, yet it's not at all obvious that
<br>
I'd like to eat an ice cream cone yesterday more than I'd like to eat
<br>
that cone today.
<br>
<p>(So far, we notice, there's no reason for a beneficient utilitarian
<br>
government to step in and make me eat my cone tomorrow instead of
<br>
eating it today, assuming that the government is trying to maximize
<br>
the sum of my pleasure states over time.  If I eat the cone at time X
<br>
rather than at time Y, at time Y I'll wish I had a cone, and at time X
<br>
I'll be happy to have one.  It doesn't matter whether time X comes
<br>
before or after time Y; I'd be just as happy, overall, either way.)
<br>
<p>There's a better explantion for why we have interest rates: money
<br>
which is used today to buy microeconomic capital like machinery,
<br>
advanced technology, training, etc. will make more money tomorrow.
<br>
<p>This has nothing to do with human desires and everything to do with
<br>
the raw material payoffs of investment.  Pleasure sensations, (and
<br>
events which satisfy preferences,) which happen when I take a bite out
<br>
of a chocolate-covered double-mint sugar cone, can't be invested today
<br>
to get more pleasure sensations tomorrow, while the money I spent on
<br>
that cone can be saved and spent on infrastructure.
<br>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>There is SOMETHING to the argument from future/past discounting, which
<br>
I take to be a real psychological fact.  This psychological fact
<br>
actually provides us with the moral reasons why we should NOT allow
<br>
the government to step in and prioritize the future for us.
<br>
<p>The argument for government stepping in and making us more
<br>
future-minded goes as follows.  Pleasure we have today is good, but
<br>
tomorrow we'll tend to feel bad that we're not having pleasure THEN.
<br>
If we tend to discount tomorrow, however, we won't count tomorrow's
<br>
regret as much as we count today's pleasure, and may find ourselves
<br>
taking pleasures today which we regret, too much, tomorrow.
<br>
<p>Of course, if we prioritize the past more than we prioritize the
<br>
present, we'll still make rational decisions.  Suppose it's time T1
<br>
and I decide that pleasure today is worth more than my future regret
<br>
at T2.  Our future (discounted) regret is outweighed by today's
<br>
pleasure.  Now suppose T2 has rolled around.  If we prioritize the
<br>
past over the present, our regret will STILL be outweighed by our
<br>
(prioritized) past.  I'd always think: &quot;Yes, the headache hurts today,
<br>
but I had so much fun last night that it's worth it.&quot;  More to the
<br>
point, I'd never catch myself overall regretful if I was fully
<br>
informed about the outcome of my actions.  As the paper points out,
<br>
I'd never say to myself: &quot;Thank heavens that bad lecture is over,&quot;
<br>
since bad lectures would actually be WORSE the further they were in
<br>
our past.
<br>
<p>All of this argument was to show that we DON'T prioritize the past
<br>
over the present, but rather we prioritize the present over the past
<br>
(as well as the future); this explains why we do stupid things today,
<br>
which we regret, more than we enjoyed them, tomorrow.
<br>
<p>The government should step in, it is argued, to MAKE us prioritize the
<br>
future over the present, to MAKE us save our money to spend later,
<br>
because we spend our money irrationally in the present.
<br>
<p>But this argument needn't stop there.  Money invested today yields
<br>
more money tomorrow.  So why not invest it ALL?  Why not invest every
<br>
cent you own on technology, training, building factories, etc. and
<br>
never again buy anything for the purposes of pleasure?  After all, the
<br>
cheap thrills you'd experience today would be 10% less (or whatever)
<br>
than the pleasure you'd reap if you'd invested your money.
<br>
<p>And, of course, the pleasure you'd get next year is 10% less than the
<br>
pleasure you'd get from saving THAT for the year after, and so on.
<br>
You'd invest it all, and always invest all of the outcome of your
<br>
investment, again and again, forever.
<br>
<p>A person who lived like that would be a super-miser.  A super-miser
<br>
would never actually be happy, since he'd consistently postpone his
<br>
happiness for later.  Compare this to a situation in which someone is
<br>
living a progressively happier life, spending some of his earnings and
<br>
saving the rest, developing investments slower than a super-miser, but
<br>
living a substantially happier life.
<br>
<p>This, I argue, is the way that life ought to be led; this is the
<br>
reason why it is rational to prioritize the present over the future,
<br>
even if we prioritize the present over the past.
<br>
<p>Another argument for prioritizing the future, the argument from
<br>
&quot;brevity/uncertainty&quot; of life, provides some reason not to be a
<br>
super-miser, but nowhere near ENOUGH reason.  According to this
<br>
argument, risk prevents us from being super-miserly.  Investment, as
<br>
we all know, is at least somewhat risky.  Some investments don't pan
<br>
out.  Some investments do pan out, but for various reasons
<br>
(e.g. death) you don't get to reap the benefits of your investment
<br>
personally.  (Death is not the ONLY such reason; it's merely the most
<br>
obvious.)
<br>
<p>Still, if this were your ONLY reason for not investing all your money,
<br>
you wouldn't spend a penny of it until the very last reasonable
<br>
instant, then blow it all.  You'd live out most of your life under the
<br>
worst possibly tolerable conditions, and then, finally, you'd go out
<br>
with a bang.  If you were immortal or if your risks were negligibly
<br>
low, you'd still be a super-miser.
<br>
<p>Worse, if you're a beneficent preference-satisfying government, (an
<br>
organization with no obvious lifespan,) you'd never take special risk
<br>
to INDIVIDUALS into account, only the expected payoff for the group.
<br>
So the fact that I might die (or for some other reason never see the
<br>
payoff from my investment) is irrelevant: the payoff from *my*
<br>
investments could go to the future pleasure of your children or other
<br>
people's children.  And their money could go to the future pleasure of
<br>
their children.  And so on, and so on, with no individual generation
<br>
or time EVER receiving a payoff from investment, since it would ALL be
<br>
reinvested.
<br>
<p>Another related argument which might be raised is that money has
<br>
diminishing marginal utility.  Having one more dollar is great when
<br>
you've only got $2, but it's just a drop in the bucket when you've got
<br>
$2 billion.
<br>
<p>This argument, as trained economists know, is actually just the
<br>
argument from risk aversion again, because having a diminishing
<br>
marginal utility is exactly the same as being risk averse; they're
<br>
perfectly logically equivalent.  If I get ten utils of pleasure from
<br>
having $1M (relative to being penniless) but I only get two more utils
<br>
from having $2M over $1M, then, if I've got $1M, I'll refuse to make a
<br>
50:50 bet of $1M.  I'll have a 50% chance of getting 2 utils, and 50%
<br>
chance of losing ten.  On average, that's a loss of 8 utils; a bad
<br>
bet.
<br>
<p>So since having a diminishing marginal utility is just the same thing
<br>
as being risk averse, arguments from diminishing marginal utility are
<br>
just arguments from risk with different phrasing, and the same
<br>
argument I applied to the argument from uncertainty applies here,
<br>
though diminishing marginal utility does suggest to us that it may be
<br>
harder than we think to invest with negligibly low risk, since risks
<br>
seem bigger the more we have to invest.
<br>
<p>Interest rates come from material payoffs, not from human desires.
<br>
Because of this, if we don't prioritize the present over the past,
<br>
then a benificient government must prefer us to be super-misers,
<br>
individuals who invest everything forever, never ever spending on
<br>
pleasure, even when we take risks and diminishing marginal utility
<br>
into account.  This is an unacceptable utilitarian outcome, and this
<br>
is the reason why we should be allowed to (apparently irrationally)
<br>
*spend* some of our money rather than investing all of it.
