<p>&lt;&lt;I just wonder about the above statement (nothing else then wonder).
<br>
Is this a &quot;new trend&quot; in being a great parent or is just overkill? Is
<br>
quite
<br>
possible that Emlyn's daughter is a &quot;little genius&quot; but what about
<br>
the other
<br>
kids? Should we (parents and grand parents) read them bed time stories
<br>
full
<br>
with microbiology and astronomy scientific explanations or should we
<br>
just
<br>
&quot;let the fables to tickle their imagination&quot;? &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I can't see that it would be any healthier for a child to live in a fantasy 
<br>
world than for an adult. Telling a kid the truth about the world doesn't 
<br>
necessarily mean reading bedtime stories filled with scientific 
<br>
explanations, but if the kid's interested it seems a shame not to satisfy 
<br>
his or her curiosity. In some cases the parent may not know the answer to 
<br>
the kid's question (as Emlyn didn't about the bacteria). That's happened to 
<br>
me from time to time ever since my daughter started talking, and I've 
<br>
handled it by helping her learn how to do research the fun way, as a joint 
<br>
mother-daughter project. Morgana had a chance to learn a couple of valuable 
<br>
lessons when her dad didn't immediately know the answer to her question: 
<br>
first that it's okay to not have all the answers and second that if you 
<br>
don't have an answer you can sometimes find it.

<p>Fantasy stories are great, and normal kids are smart enough to know the 
<br>
difference between fantasy and reality, unless adults mislead them.
<br>
<p>However, she's also interested in the real thing. I don't think this is
<br>
<em>&gt;anything specific to her; I've talked to lots of kids here and there about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science/techie stuff; they really like it.
</em><br>
<p>Same here. And I've often found that my understanding of how things work 
<br>
increases as a result of answering kids' questions.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I object to the fairytails-only mental diet fed to many kids. It seems to be
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Or worse, to blindly infect the kids in ways the adults never really 
<br>
stopped to think about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I can't help feeding my kids my own beliefs, just like every other parent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm trying to counter that by giving them as much independant access to real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information as I can. That means encouraging them to learn to read as early
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as possible, encouraging them to ask questions and find things out. It also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;means relatively unfettered internet access as soon as it is useful (ie:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when reading is at a high enough standard) - that's a bit scary, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;couldn't justify not doing it.
</em><br>
<p>I've never limited my kid's access to the Internet, books, TV, or 
<br>
movies.And I've let her make her own choices about life in general for the 
<br>
most part (although with my guidance if she wanted it). As she's grown up 
<br>
she's gotten into less trouble and been far less rebellious than kids whose 
<br>
parents were stricter. I've noticed this same thing with other kids whose 
<br>
parents haven't tired to limit their knowledge of the real world.
