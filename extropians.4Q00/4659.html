</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong-headed to the core, as far as I could make out. The notion it argued
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seemed to be (1) in the near future genomic engineering *really does work*,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you actually can optimize your offspring to produce phenotypically superior
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;new world horrors *by sheer grit*. Yeah, right. Just like a house cat can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beat a cheetah in a race *given the right spiritual attitude*.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with your general assessment of this stupid movie, but let me 
<br>
carry this observation to a logical extreme.  As far as I could tell, 
<br>
the genomic engineering *did*not* really work.  There was no 
<br>
detectable difference between the enhanced humans and the 
<br>
non-enhanced humans.  Except for an unsubstantiated feeling of 
<br>
superiority, and a unsupported prejudice against the unenhanced, no 
<br>
one could tell the difference without a genetic test.  For all we 
<br>
know, the enhancement was simply a &quot;Microsoft&quot; signature tacked on 
<br>
the end of the genome.
<br>
<p>The enhanced humans were not really superior.  They didn't learn more 
<br>
or faster than the unenhanced human did.  They didn't perform 
<br>
physical feats that the unenhanced human could not.  There was no 
<br>
reason to exclude unenhanced humans from the space program.  The 
<br>
message of the movie seemed to be that if all the tests to keep out 
<br>
unenhanced humans were bypassed, no one would really would notice the 
<br>
difference.  The unenhanced human would perform just as well as the 
<br>
unenhanced human.
<br>
<p>Therefore, I am not sure that human spirit beats out genetic 
<br>
enhancements in this movie.  I think the real story was that people 
<br>
claim superiority even when no actual enhancements were evident.  I 
<br>
thought this movie was really about a self-appointed master race that 
<br>
claimed genetic superiority where none existed.
