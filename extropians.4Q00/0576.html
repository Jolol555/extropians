One observation cluster, after which I will shut up. Notice that the
<br>
header of this page say explicitly
<br>
<p>&quot;...in their relationships with their spouses or male partners...&quot;.
<br>
<p>I believe I understand that this subthread was about a claim that men
<br>
vastly predominate in overall violent crime. The response was to mention
<br>
a whole bunch of research on women acting in domestically violent ways.
<br>
<p>There is a disconnect here; no numerical relationship of the two
<br>
populations is made. Certainly, some people don't have partners;
<br>
certainly, partners are not the only people who attack other people.
<br>
Also, since it's a quick set of summaries, no definitions are provided,
<br>
e.g., what constituted &quot;severe physical aggression&quot; in dating? Slapping
<br>
someone who said something rude? Or forcing a broken broomstick up his
<br>
alimentary system?
<br>
<p>I once had a bad scene in which, as I was leaving, the female I was
<br>
arguing with slammed the door while my hand was curled around the jamb.
<br>
Blood and pain ensued. Did she assault me, or was she just trying to
<br>
keep me from leaving? I figured the latter, and still do. I have never
<br>
assaulted a woman. So someone looking for it would smell blood (so to
<br>
speak) and tally up another 1-to-nothing woman-harming-man stat. Would
<br>
that be right?
<br>
<p>It would be interesting to see a male v female breakdown on state and
<br>
federal crime statistics per se. Not to say that the general state of
<br>
those (completeness, accuracy, standards, etc.) is anything to be proud
<br>
of. After the numbers were up, we could make claims about how they
<br>
seemed skewed.
