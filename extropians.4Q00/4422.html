<p><em>&gt; I love it when bright &quot;amateurs&quot; figure things out from first principles and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come to the same conclusion that &quot;experts&quot; do.  In this case, Anders, you'd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done something I've seen happen a number of times since becoming involved in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the transhumanist community: You've invented the Anglo-American common law of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;products liability&quot; and identified one of its key challenges.  Here, in two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paragraphs, you've recapitulated 200 years of the development of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jurisprudence and arrived at the frontier of a field that absorbs a legion of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good minds in economics and law.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks! That felt good! I vividly remember when as a child I managed
<br>
my first geometrical proof (the area of a parallelogram) and then
<br>
discovered that somebody Euclid had beaten me with a few millennia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The challenge is indeed how best to use the clear benefits of the fine-tuned 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feedback of the case-by-case common law liability mechanism.  The superiority 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this system to the Continental system of a-priori precise legislation and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administrative regulation is clear, since it uses an on-going process of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clarification and adjustment of standards to evolving circumstances in a way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's more insulated from temporary political pressures than the civil law 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system is.
</em><br>
<p>Anglic empirism versus continental rationalism? 
<br>
<p>So the main issue is how to set up the feedback so that it adapts at
<br>
an optimal rate, and also adapt the &quot;strength&quot; of the corrections it
<br>
sets up to avoid too little or too much feedback. Oh, it is just a
<br>
simple optimization problem, as a friend once said about economy :-)
<br>
<p>Actually it sounds a bit like the learning problems we are studying in
<br>
neural networks and the brain - how does a system set its learning
<br>
rate so that it is optimal for a given environment, and adapt it fast
<br>
enough (metalearning) when the environment changes. In this example
<br>
the individual cases and market provides the first level of learning,
<br>
setting the price for various risks. Then there is both some
<br>
adaptation where various cases and political decisions influence the
<br>
strength of the feedback and adaptation to changes in the amount of
<br>
super-mega-risk? 
<br>
<p>The problem seem to be that while there is no shortage of learning
<br>
material on the first level (the everyday cases and transactions),
<br>
making learning relatively efficient, you get far less learning and
<br>
more reliance on the a priori methods on the metalevel.
<br>
<p>Maybe it could be improved if there was a better way of accumulating
<br>
and learning from such decisions on a global scale (a bit like how I
<br>
think politicians might have use for a database showing the results of
<br>
decisions similar to ones they are considering). This is of course the
<br>
job of the historians.
