<em>&gt;Chuck,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     With all respect to you; can't you figure this one out?  Look at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;average Anti-gun zealots mail.  It is full of data, carefully framed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quotations of how their leaders only want to save lives not ban guns and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reveal that they have excellent sites that will give you the full story
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against guns.  This is a well financed and orchestrated campaign to get all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guns out of the country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     As part of that campaign they demonize Lott, the NRA and anyone else 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opposes them.  I especially enjoy the hoops they jump through trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explain away our constitutional right to bear arms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I don't shoot or belong to the NRA and I mostly watch this debate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lurking position in the corner of the room but truly the anti gun zealots are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;easy to see through.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     What is their goal?  A country, possibly a world, where only they or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people they approve of have guns.  Why would I say that?  Again just watch;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then tell me the next time you see one of the zealot's leaders without an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;armed guard.  Please, if you ever see one send me an email.  I'll mark it in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my journal as worthy of remembrance.

<p>I know - I just wanted to make Joe think there. I am fully aware of the 
<br>
process by which we are being stripped of all rights, not just guns. The 
<br>
Million Moms &quot;grassroots&quot; movement is a prime example.
<br>
<p>I have yet to see any anti in public without an armed escort.
<br>
<p>If you have never been shooting, check out the nearest pistol range - most 
<br>
of them rent guns. It's a real hoot! If you are ever in the Chicago area, 
<br>
drop me a line, and I would be glad to let you check out an &quot;assault rifle&quot; 
<br>
or two.
