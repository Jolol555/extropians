The thesis is that if you're powerful enough to protect you're

indistinguishable from the enemy. Same problem as with grey goo

<p>Whoever stays behind wavefront, he's not important, because he's not

the first interactor. You'll only see the pioneers, because the

wavefront is self-selective. Whoever is slower than wavefront arrives
<br>
second, third, and fourth. If you're still alive by then, and can
<br>
meaningfully interact, you can try talking with the late arrivals.
<br>
<p>Of course this won't happen, because we're about to hatch
<br>
ourselves. Whoever is going to drop by, he better do it within the
<br>
next few hundred years.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; reason to assume everything is explanable and predictable according to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; auto-replication models or by comparing super-intelligent species and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; their agents to RNA.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Super-intelligent species are also subject to the laws of physics and
<br>
evolution. And the point is precisely that you don't need to be
<br>
super-intelligent (in fact quite to opposite, it adds to the overhead)
<br>
to sustain a wave propagation across the cosmic substrate.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Not so.  You do not need to synch action across huge volumes to stop
</em><br>
<em> &gt; encroachment on protected areas.  Local intelligent defenses of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; sufficient caliber will be adequate.  The encroachment is limited by
</em><br>
<em> &gt; even greater constraints than speed of light communication.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
You've reinvented Eliezer's sysop, only inserted from the
<br>
outside. Notice that the observable universe, if not a collossal
<br>
Potyemkin's facade, is incompartible with anyone powerful. You need to
<br>
have presence and massive gunpower coupled with absolute
<br>
self-restraint. That's a lot of hefty assumptions. How exactly, will a
<br>
superciv prevent the propagation of wavefront? You can only call back
<br>
the seeds as long your technological advance makes you faster. Notice
<br>
that the seeds get selected for speed. If you tarry even a little, you
<br>
lose your speed advantage (intercepting something which sets out to
<br>
cover a distance of a few lightyears from a distance of 100 lightyears
<br>
is no small feat, plus consider the volume you have to police, and
<br>
expand into -- your expansion fleet technology must be exceedingly
<br>
brittle to not to engender an even more fatal growth front -- since
<br>
you're already so fast and reckless to start with).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; What pray tell is real physics post-Singularity?  It is to laugh to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; dismiss &quot;science fiction physics&quot; out of hand.  What a science fiction
</em><br>
<p>Something which exists outside of limit of known physics does not
<br>
exist in the scientific context. Since we're at least trying to upkeep
<br>
a mirage of science, this really helps to stick to known facts.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; writer can come up with today is merely a jumping off point for the best
</em><br>
<em> &gt; scientists today.  Post-singularity with vastly increased and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; concentrated intelligence much that is science-fiction will be child's
</em><br>
<em> &gt; play.  The inner areas of galaxies?  If they are sterile of life it is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; probably due to higher radiation, asteroid bombardment and so on.  At
</em><br>
<em> &gt; least sterile of life as we usually define it.  Post-SI entities could
</em><br>
<em> &gt; probably exist and thrive in some remarkably &quot;sterile&quot; environments.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
This is very true, but I was talking about emergence of biological
<br>
life. Since it can't emerge there, it has to emerge elsewhere, and
<br>
migrate in. You don't see metabolism signatures of anything smart out
<br>
there. So we're not in their lightcone.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; Not in the least.  I simply expect intelligence, esepcially much higher
</em><br>
<em> &gt; intelligence to manage to make and keep agreements that increase its
</em><br>
<p>You assume intelligence as a shining clear single 100 ct gem. I have
<br>
to disappoint you, statistical behaviour of large groups of
<br>
intelligent beings entangled in a darwinian process does follow
<br>
larger-scale behaviour. It's messy. They're also only doing blind
<br>
optimization. There's is no homunculus inside your brain, and crowds
<br>
of smart people do not necessarily act intelligently themselves.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; overall benefits and avoid too much conflict and chaos.  I would rather
</em><br>
<em> &gt; bet on that than bet that a model based on replicating bacteria is more
</em><br>
<em> &gt; applicable.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Smarter beings can only help if their intelligence is correlated with
<br>
faster and farther travel. It is not obvious why this should be
<br>
true. Reckless replication and minimal complexity (=less baggage to
<br>
replicate) as well as fast travel (possibly invented by advanced
<br>
beings somewhere far behind the wavefront and lost their intelligence
<br>
baggage along the way) are the most obvious components of the
<br>
wavefront fitness function. Unless there's a reason why empathy gets
<br>
conserved when interacting with players which can't reciprocate, it is
<br>
not obvious why the gods should care. To them, universe is either
<br>
sterile, or god-grade already. If it's sterile (in their eyes we're
<br>
biofilm -- but we'll upgrade to full blown deity pretty soon), it is
<br>
theirs to take. We won't stop mining Mars just because there might be
<br>
a few primitive bacteria up there, won't we? If it's god grade, they
<br>
shake hands and exchange pleasantries with their peers.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Dunno.  We would miss serious nanotech level defenses in say the Oort
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Cloud today.  Hell, we would miss significant nanotech level presence
</em><br>
<p>Why is the universe sterile? Why are all these resources laying
<br>
fallow? Even virtual navelgazing can profit from
<br>
parallelism. Computers couple to physical reality.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; even on earth. What makes you think for a second that the more advanced
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and more moral species will stand for the fast dumb brutes marching
</em><br>
<em> &gt; roughshod over the developing races?  Personally I would tend to protect
</em><br>
<em> &gt; developing races and make sure they don't get too far out into the rest
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of the galaxy while they still are &quot;dumb brutes&quot;.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
They're not &quot;still&quot;, they're *already* dumb brutes. Cyanobacteria
<br>
typically don't develop interstellar travel. Keeping on running
<br>
without making a stop is not something which I associate with
<br>
intelligent behaviour.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Sigh. You seem unable to think beyond your own model of endless conflict
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to see that it is actually in the interest of intelligent species to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; cooperate and that it might be considered in their interest to carefully
</em><br>
<p>It is only in the interest of intelligent species to cooperate if they 
<br>
can profit from the interaction.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; guard the development of young species.  It is not that hard to set up
</em><br>
<em> &gt; agreements between species that have mutual interests and agreements
</em><br>
<em> &gt; about what is important. 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I know where you're coming from (I've been there before) but you
<br>
refuse to see where the logic of this all is leading this to. You
<br>
don't have to like it (I don't) but you have to acknowledge it.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt; If you can expand, you will. If you can't or won't, you're irrelevant,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; because no one is ever going to interact with you. Hence either Rare
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; Earth, or the Zoo.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Expansion is not the end and be all that you attempt to make it.  There
</em><br>
<p>No, but if you don't expand you'll never be observed and interact with
<br>
anybody else but a passing pioneer front -- which is then supposedly
<br>
no problem for you. The universe is a large place, and intelligent
<br>
life nucleation density seems to be very low. (Though it is difficult
<br>
to see how a species of billions of spatially distant diverse
<br>
individuals (it is not easy to see how any wet life can produce
<br>
anything else) can agree to never venture outside of the small ring
<br>
they set to themselves -- notice about the properties of individuals
<br>
who chose to do so, the first step of self-selection).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; are other things of massive importance that make an individual or a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; species worth interacting with.  Expansion does not equate to mindless
</em><br>
<p>We're not an advanced species. We're not worth interacting with on
<br>
equal footing.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; expansion that destroys and consumes everything else other than itself
</em><br>
<em> &gt; regardless.  In all the vastness of space other life might be rare
</em><br>
<p>I know, you've said that often enough, but you never falsified the
<br>
reasons of why the wavefront critters will be nasty.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; enough to be held quite special and worthy of respect and room to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; develop.  
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't compute.
