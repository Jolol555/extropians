</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Perhaps this is an argument for not using things that resemble such

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your hypothesis seems to be that the architecture of the human mind is poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at communicating with other minds, and that some other architecture might do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much better.  You might be right, but I suspect that what you are seeing is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainly the intrinsic difficulty of communication, which any architecture

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's no obvious reason to expect them to do much better any time soon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I think you have missed my point.  My premise is that it is not the
<br>
inherent difficulty of communication that is the problem but the very
<br>
way the human brain is built and therefore learns and stores information
<br>
that is the difficulty.  My its nature &quot;learning&quot; in the human brain (or
<br>
similarly build artificial brains) takes place by the associations
<br>
formed and stored.  But this bundles up all learning with everything
<br>
else that is so cross-associated and makes both separation of the
<br>
learning and efficiently transferring it to another such mind quite
<br>
difficult.
