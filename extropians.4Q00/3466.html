&quot;Most successful mass stuff like this&quot;? Name three other things like
<br>
coding an HTML web page. Name five. There is no question that the Web
<br>
has succeeded. And so most people put up with all the things wrong with
<br>
it--&quot;404 not found&quot; being one of the biggest. No rotten fruit to be
<br>
thrown at you--you're eating it. And so am I. Every damned day.
<br>
<p>Not sour grapes, though. :)

<em>&gt; Cool stuff. However, I'd say the web has done well because of the simplicity
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is probably just as basic.

<em>&gt; &gt; TWO CHEERS FOR THE WORLD WIDE WEB

<em>&gt; &gt; in it you will find:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;The Web is a foam of ever-popping bubbles, ever-changing shopwindows.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;The Web is the minimal concession to hypertext that a

<em>&gt; &gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;The Xanadu® project did not 'fail to invent HTML'.  HTML is precisely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what we were trying to PREVENT-- ever-breaking links, links going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outward only, quotes you can't follow to their origins, no version
