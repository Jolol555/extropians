<p><em>&gt;Holding all primaries on the same day gives the advantage to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incumbent and/or whoever has the most money. Holding early
</em><br>
<em>&gt;primaries in small states allows a less affluent candidate to gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exposure and credibility (and thus the increased ability to raise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;funds for more expensive large states). McCain did well here in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;NH, and gave him enough exposure for the people to learn why he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more than what his handlers and the media said he was: he has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mean streak, holds grudges, has few friends among his co-workers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and is willing to spout the accepted government line on the 2nd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amendment in order to get 'soccer mom votes, contrary to his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;claims. If there had not been a long period of exposure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for McCain between NH/Iowa and Super Tuesday, most people would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not have found this out. Additionally, if the primaries were not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;open primaries (i.e. people could cross party lines to vote in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;primary), then 3rd party candidates would have better showing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Primaries are not to select popular candidates among the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;population, but popular candidates among party membership. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;insist on being an independent, then you shouldn't get to select
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which nominated candidate you get from each party. Thats what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;write-in candidate is for.
</em><br>
<p>In the current system it's a matter of semeiotics.
<br>
<p>The reason New Hampshire matters is because New Hampshire is FIRST.
<br>
The amount of money spent per inhabitant is huge compared to later
<br>
on. As you correctly pointed out establishing an early lead means
<br>
a candidate can more easily gather additional funds.
<br>
<p>The problem is that for the rest of us it eliminates choice. By the
<br>
time the primaries get to us in Illinois the only decision was
<br>
whether or not to bother going to the polls to vote for the only
<br>
guy still left in. I voted for Keyes, because he was still in the
<br>
running, (and I liked him) McCain dropped out the week before the
<br>
primary.
<br>
<p>There is no reason to belong to a political party if your
<br>
membership has no affect on your ability to choose.
<br>
<p>The primary system is badly flawed and needs to be
<br>
modified/replaced. I've already suggested an alternative in another
<br>
post.
