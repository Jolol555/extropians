<br>
The posthumans are in Jupiter, having previously disassembled Ganymede, and
<br>
the Cassini Division patrols the rings of Jupiter.  
<br>
<p>&quot;The Cassini Division... In astronomy, the Cassini is a dark band in the rings
<br>
of Saturn.  In the astronautics of the Heliocene Epoch, the Cassini Division
<br>
was the proud name -- originally given in jest -- of a dark band indeed, a
<br>
military force in the ring of Jupiter.&quot;
<br>
<p>Note that said ring is more substantial than it is today, due to the
<br>
diassembling of Ganymede.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; fastminds.  The fastminds are evil and must be destroyed,
</em><br>
<p>This is simplistic.  The Solar Union has the &quot;true knowledge&quot;, which denies
<br>
the utility of terms such as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;.  It's a war of predators,
<br>
started by the posthumans when they were humans, humans who (like many on this
<br>
list) bragged about the coming extinction of the human race, and the
<br>
disassembly of the planets, including Earth.  But those who wish to remain
<br>
human aren't fuzzy-bunny people; they wish to remain the top predators.  Even
<br>
if the Jovians were peaceful Ellen (the book's protagonist) would be
<br>
suspicious of them _because_ they are more capable and powerful than humans,
<br>
and because they can't be bound or trusted (because you can never tell if
<br>
they're honest, or deep lying and planning to turn.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; like humans are all right by MacLeod.  But uploads that leave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the human form, environment, speed, and styles of thought are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an evil horror.
</em><br>
<p>No, they're superhuman, and threaten to overshadow humanity.  In the Culture
<br>
humans accept being pets and parasites of the Minds, having designed them to
<br>
be that way.  The Solar Union, faced with Minds with a more aggressive
<br>
background, is more inclined to attack.  Complicated, of course, by the
<br>
dominant (but false) view in the Union that the Jovians aren't actually
<br>
conscious, just dead machines.
<br>
<p>BTW, I thought the New Martian ship was suborned not by non-sentient viruses,
<br>
but an actual Jovian; pretty much being taken over by a Vingean Power.
<br>
<p>What's really weird about MacLeod is 
<br>
<p>a) The Union itself was created and run by a human-friendly socialist
<br>
fastmind.  (There's only a teeny hint of this in tCD, you have to connect with
<br>
_The Star Fraction_ and _The Sky Road_.)
<br>
<p>b) The first fastminds in human history (tSF) were innocent and angelic, but
<br>
wiped out.
<br>
<p>c) In another book, the friendly utopian fastmind gets turned on by 'good'
<br>
humans, who don't like the idea of living in a machine.
<br>
<p>d) MacLeod himself doesn't actually believe in AI at all.  (I can't explain
<br>
why.)  Actually he claimed once that AI tended to be favored by libertarian
<br>
types; socalists, although otherwise materialist, seem to avoid believing in
<br>
machine intelligence, Banks being the most visible exception.
<br>
<p><p>As Damien B. says it's hard to get a real &quot;line&quot; out of MacLeod.  
<br>
<p>OTOH, Robin's basically right.  The Jovians are a threat (effectively 'evil',
<br>
from the human POV) because they're selfish and aggressive, because they come
<br>
from selfish and aggressive people.  (Extropians.)  Fastminds with different
<br>
bases are better... although not necessarily ideal, even when offering utopia.
<br>
