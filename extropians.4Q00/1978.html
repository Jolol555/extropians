<p>Do allow me to make one semi-serious point among the mirth
<br>
and jocularity.  Whenever the nanotech enthusiasts speak publicly,
<br>
they point out the dangers of the technology, and spend some time
<br>
describing possible safety measures, such as Ralph's broadcast
<br>
architecture.  Every time I hear Drexler or Merkle speak, they
<br>
mention safeguards.
<br>
<p>What is Singularity Institute's counterpart to that?  Are yall thinking
<br>
safety?  Is there some kind of technology which would allow yall
<br>
to hit the off switch if something goes awry?  You know Im a big
<br>
fan of the HWoMBeP and all of yall, but if yall are rushing headlong
<br>
into unknown and dangerous technology without appropriate safety
<br>
measures (if such a term even applies) then I understand some of
<br>
the criticism yall are getting.  spike
