</em><br>
<p>Even if this means I can have all the headlines from 53 different

script-fu -- on my side. I did try this but it didn't scale even on
<br>
768/768 xDSL not to mention my current crappy dialup), is this still
<br>
the page on a local machine?  And do I have the message bodies on the
<br>
local machine, so I can retrieve them without delay? Reliably (because
<br>
MTU protocol is a lot more robust than HTTP)?

<br>
You must be joking. I don't have to subscribe to all my mailing lists
<br>
each time I fetchmail (roughly hourly, I can't hog the current phone
<br>
line). And the average MByte of mail I get/day are easily consumed by
<br>
loading just *one* web site. Right now my entire inbox is worth 63
<br>
MBytes, equivalent to more than 12 kMessages, assembled in about two
<br>
months.

<em> &gt; Please direct your comments at how ExtroDot specifically can improve. I

<p>It can't. Because it's a web thing. Now if you can get ExtroDot

content (not just headlines) delivered into my mailbox as plain text
<br>
in single mail increments, we're in business.

A webmonkey can't help being a simian. It's an occupational hazard ;P

<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Ditto. Have you even bothered to look at the Extrodot site? 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Nope, I was talking about /. clones in general. I believe it's slick,
<br>
loads fast, and is about as mean and lean as webpages can
<br>
get. Unfortunately, it's still a web page.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt; * unless I run a tweaked squid and have essentially infinite drive

<em> &gt; &gt;   space I don't have that information stored. Not so with hypermailed 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt;   and full-text indexed inboxes, these are much easier on drive space
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Huh? Extodot sits on *our* drivespace, not yours. Unless you choose
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to save a particular posting or article locally. It's *more* efficient
</em><br>
<em> &gt; on disk space. 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I'm a digital pack rat. I don't trust content to be there tomorrow
<br>
when I see it today. Because, like, every third link I click is dead
<br>
like, totally. Rather frustrating, this. Other people are solving this 
<br>
by running squid in total web trail mode, me, I don't have that much
<br>
hard drive space. So I grab whatever I deem useful. Because web
<br>
doesn't allow me to save the entire document, I have to resort to
<br>
naked .html, txt, .ps.gz and .pdf
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt; * I usually have about 100 browser windows open, which have lots of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt;   state in them. Sooner or later the whole shebang crashes, resulting
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt;   in me producing weird muffled noises and wanting to strangle Netscape 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt;   programmers. All of them.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Your misconfigured browser and your misconfigured computer is no more
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I'm running the leanest browser version I know, have a
<br>
browser half life time of a week despite heavy use (abovementioned 100
<br>
simultaneously open sessions) and system uptimes well in excess of a
<br>
month (usually, due to creeping memory leaks (thanks again, Netscape
<br>
programmers) lwhich et ran my swap space (256 MBytes) full, and when I
<br>
forget to weekly kill and restart the browser, the system will sooner
<br>
or later typically crash). It would sure help if I had a gig of core,
<br>
but I'm not that rich.
<br>
<p>Opera is not quite there yet when it comes to stability (but it is
<br>
making good progress), nor is Galeon (also almost there). However, the
<br>
problem is principal. You can't render complex content in a
<br>
sustainably stable fashion, using state of the art software
<br>
development. On the other hand, I can rely on the average software to
<br>
render simple content (ASCII) reliably.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; ExtroDot's problem than your misconfigured email client or sendmail
</em><br>
<em> &gt; server is <a href="mailto:extropians@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20A%20plea%20for%20restraint&In-Reply-To=&lt;14823.48039.637305.142456@lrz.uni-muenchen.de&gt;">extropians@extropy.org</a>'s problem.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
You should know my reactions are typically not knee-jerk. There is
<br>
usually a reason for what I do. And thank you for your concern, but I
<br>
manage to run a quite stable system without apparent gross
<br>
misconfigurations, despite this not being my job.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt; * Browsers not only crash, they eat memory like crazy for each page
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt;   rendered. And, yeah, memory leaks. Lots of them. Comes with
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt;   braindead programmers trying to render complex content specified 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt;   in a braindead language transported by braindead protocols
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Which is why none of this list's readers use web browsers. Oops, I
</em><br>
<em> &gt; should have known this World Wide Web thing would never catch on.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I've never liked the web. When the CERN dudes came out with HTML, my
<br>
first thoughts were 1) great, something new which totally ignores
<br>
prior art (both TeX and PostScript) and is not a programming language
<br>
2) it doesn't do typography? uh-oh. In a few years they'll wind up
<br>
reintroducing basic typographic capabilities, in dribs and drabs,
<br>
until the thing breaks all over the place.
<br>
<p>So we did have 4 major HTML revisions, now there's XML which is
<br>
falling into complexity morass even before it is widely deployed, we
<br>
have about five different, incompatible widely misused scripting
<br>
languages which further increase browser instability and are a system
<br>
security nightmare. 
<br>
<p>While I did not predict the browser wars with their full viciousness,
<br>
and the amount of actual balkanization does surprise me, the overall
<br>
trend has been predictable. Man, nowadays the web sucks so badly I
<br>
don't even have to vacuum the living room anymore.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; Hey, if your VAX or whatever it is doesn't have enough memory to run
</em><br>
<em> &gt; a GUI browser, ExtroDot will work just fine with Lynx. I've tested it.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I'm not rich, so I can only afford 1/4 GByte. I understand this is 2-4 
<br>
times average user's memory size. And why on Earth should I run lynx?
<br>
It's still a browser, and a lousy one at that. If I need to grab stuff 
<br>
from an uri, I use wget.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt; * slash(hash, dash, mash)dots do everything server-side, which does
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt;   not allow me with to engage my proven idjit filter (notice that 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt;   even low grade morons can click, but it takes at least an 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt;   imbecile to set up a mail configuration, and subcribe to a 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt;   push medium. Also, the overhead usually prevents said idjits to fire 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt;   up their insightful one-liners)
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Finally you're getting to a rational criticism. You should have started
</em><br>
<p>That's the general malaise with you web people, you don't even accept
<br>
user criticism. This makes web doubly broken, because without problem
<br>
awareness there will be no fixing. Uck, ptui. Gag me with a pitchfork.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; with this point in the first place. Tell me more about your filters.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; They may already exist as features, or they may be relatively easy to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; implement.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; * I can go on, but this really proves web is totally broken
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; No it doesn't. Please, do go on.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Eugene, I apologize for the sarcastic tone of this message. I have the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; utmost respect for you, but I get as irritated by junk logic as you
</em><br>
<p>Ditto here. So I will put away the razor, at least for this time ;)
<br>
<p><em> &gt; do. To the rest of you-- you won't get the Eugene treatment; please
</em><br>
<em> &gt; don't be afraid to speak up. Eugene is a special case because I know he
</em><br>
<em> &gt; knows better.
</em><br>
<p>Naw, impossible.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; I leave everybody with this question to ponder:
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Is there an inherent difference between push and pull media, or is this
</em><br>
<em> &gt; difference arbitrary, artifactual, and potentially transparent to the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; user in the same way as &quot;static location vs. search query&quot; or &quot;local
</em><br>
<em> &gt; volume vs. distributed file system&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>It's not just about push and pull. I won't tolerate HTML pushed at me
<br>
either.
<br>
<p>I'm not even bitter. An atypical user will always get creamed, but he
<br>
should be used to it. 98% of everything is crap, so the web is just a
<br>
particular special case of the general rule.
