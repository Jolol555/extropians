There is selection pressure for the replicators to advance as quickly as
<br>
possible.  Robin basically analyzes the steady state, the &quot;climax ecology&quot;
<br>
of the replication wavefront.  At that point it may be that the best
<br>
strategy is a lightweight replication, similar to what Eugene supplies.
<br>
A few days or weeks disassembling asteroids, building solar collectors,
<br>
masers and probes, and you're off.  You then build defenses to keep
<br>
competitors from coming in afterwards and using the remaining system
<br>
resources to leapfrog you.  After the wavefront is far enough away,
<br>
even these are no longer needed.  Evolution is through with you.
<br>
<p>However it seems unlikely that an intelligent being would intentionally
<br>
launch such an effort.  There would be no point.  The wave accomplishes
<br>
nothing; it passes through the universe, leaving it largely unchanged.
<br>
No one benefits.
<br>
<p>What seems more plausible is that a traditional colonization effort could
<br>
evolve into a space race, which would eventually culminate in the cosmic
<br>
burning that Robin describes.  As time goes on, original motivations like
<br>
colonization, information collection, and communication with the nucleus
<br>
of the effort would be downgraded in importance.  Those colonies which
<br>
emphasize speed of spreading come to dominate.  This slippery slope
<br>
eventually leads to the mindless replication wave.
<br>
<p>Given that this potentiality exists, wouldn't it be relatively easy
<br>
for the colonizing agency to prevent it?  Could it &quot;lock in&quot; certain
<br>
principles in its daughter colonies, designed to make sure that the
<br>
built in motivations are not lost?
<br>
<p>Evolution requires variation and selection.  But variation can be
<br>
controlled through engineering principles.  Our own DNA is arguably
<br>
designed and evolved to promote successful variation.  Engineers can
<br>
choose different principles to prevent variation, or to control it.
<br>
<p>Given enough time, any engineered system will break.  In the long enough
<br>
run, built-in constraints will be violated.  But it seems plausible that
<br>
this can be made much longer than the expected history of the universe.
<br>
Foresight recently proposed preventing evolution of nanotech replicators
<br>
via cryptographic checking.  Such technologies should allow designed
<br>
systems to be subject to the whims of evolution only in those parameters
<br>
allowed by the creators.
<br>
<p>Evolutionary based analyses are powerful and suggestive, but they can't be
<br>
taken literally without a mechanism to show that variation and selection
<br>
will occur at effective rates.  Even without any externally imposed
<br>
restraints, it took trillions of generations on Earth for replicators to
<br>
evolve significant multicellular complexity.  Once you are talking about
<br>
engineered systems built by intelligent beings for specific purposes,
<br>
the role played by evolution may be much smaller than in Earthly life.
