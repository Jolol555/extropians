It's going to be an arms race for some, and open arms for others. I
<br>
think a sheaf of strategies and solutions, if not a spectrum, is
<br>
healthy. 
<br>
<p>More people should adopt technology more mindfully than they seem to, I
<br>
think--but I don't know how to do that for anyone other than myself, and
<br>
I don't have a perfect track record by any means.
<br>
<p>Some people boggle to discover that many Plain Folk in Pennsylvania have
<br>
cell phones. This is because they think the Amish are luddites, when
<br>
they are not. They are, however, very selective about the technologies
<br>
they adopt. More power to that, say I.
<br>
<p>I think secluded glens off the information superhighway are a fine idea,
<br>
even if some of them have razor wire around them. If you can keep 'em.
