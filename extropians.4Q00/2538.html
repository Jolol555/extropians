(extropians-digest):
<br>
<p><em>&gt;------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Every day, we are bombarded with advertising, messages,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and memetic influences that keep us enslaved to materialism.  Why do I live
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such a self-destructive life that I can't seem to find a way to escape?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mainly because I'm a powerless, corporate pawn.  I don't want the life that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have- but I know no way out, at least none that looks very appealing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minute I step out into the cold Minnesota air.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You may want to consider referring to your namesake,
<br>
Nicolaus von Koeln, who Had A Plan:
<br>
<p>&quot; They were asked by many people on whose 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;advice or at whose urging they had set 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;out upon this path. They were asked 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;especially since only a few years ago 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;many kings, a great many dukes, and 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;innumerable people in powerful companies 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;had gone there and had returned with 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the business unfinished. The present 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;groups, morever, were still of tender 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;years and were neither strong enough 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nor powerful enough to do anything.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Everyone, therefore, accounted them 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;foolish and imprudent for trying to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;do this. They briefly replied that 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;they were equal to the Divine will 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in this matter and that, whatever 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;God might wish to do with them, they 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;would accept it willingly and with 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;humble spirit. They thus made some 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;little progress on their journey.&quot;
