<p><em>    &gt; you'll note my emphasis of the word &quot;particular.&quot;  As it stands, MY
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; discrete experience of reality is contained within a -particular- pattern.
</em><br>
<p>A pattern is nothing but information, if it's the same information then it's
<br>
the same particular pattern.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Unless you are proposing a means by which that particular discrete reality
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; experiencer is able to transition to a new substrate,
</em><br>
<p>I am proposing such a mechanism,  use a pattern to know how to arrange off
<br>
the shelf atoms in the same way they were before, the result is another you.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; *I* (by definition)
</em><br>
<p>I'd like to hear what your definition of &quot;I&quot; is. I'll give you two of mine,  both work pretty well.
<br>
1) I am John Clark's thoughts.
<br>
2) I am matter that behaves in a John Clarkian way.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; [I] will not be thrilled with the copy process.
</em><br>
<p>You might have been copied and destroyed a billion times a second every second of your
<br>
life from the day you were born and you wouldn't even know it. As I said, a nanosecond is
<br>
far too short to have a thought, and yet something still thinks, something is still conscious.
<br>
That something is you.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;The copy process could fail and the results would be identical
</em><br>
<p>Not so, if the copy process failed externally things would be very different, nobody could
<br>
talk to me anymore for one thing, and my subjective experience would be different too
<br>
because I wouldn't have one.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; with respect to the perspective of the original discrete reality experiencer
</em><br>
<p>I've been trying to puzzle out from your context what &quot;the original&quot; is but I've been unsuccessful,
<br>
it might as well be Egyptian hieroglyphics,  all I'm sure of is that it's 11 ASCII characters.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Well, that's sort of a fast and loose definition of death,
</em><br>
<p>Except for pure mathematics I don't think precise definitions are very important but
<br>
If you have a better definition of death than having a last thought I'd love to hear it.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;its difficult to even call the new pattern MY thoughts, since they are discrete
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;from the original.
</em><br>
<p>What's discrete about it?  And what's &quot;the original&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; What if you were to make 10 copies?  Would they all be my thoughts?
</em><br>
<p>Certainly, they would all be Jason Joel Thompson's thoughts.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;They would each be their own divergent reality experiencer
</em><br>
<p>As time progressed they would start to diverge into different people due to
<br>
differences in the environment they experience or just because of random
<br>
fluctuations, but at the instant they were made they'd all be you.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; How are you transferring my subjective experience of reality across the two
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; humans?
</em><br>
<p>Superbly.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;If you don't destroy the original, do I somehow get to experience
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;both realities simultaneously in a single brain?
</em><br>
<p>Only if both of you are in a identical environment, but then experiencing
<br>
two identical environments is undistinguishable from experiencing one.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; you could create such a copy covertly and I, unawares, could walk out onto
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the street and get hit by a bus-- does my subjective experience then
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; mysteriously jump across to the clone?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, assuming the copy was made a nanosecond before the bus hit.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;You -will- have pleasing and  effective results if the copying resolution is
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;fine-grained enough-- I don't  dispute that.  But should you leave the 'original'
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;intact, you now have TWO  discrete experiencers
</em><br>
<p>Let's cut to the chase, there is one way and one way only that could be true,
<br>
if the holly rollers turned out to be right and the human soul exists. I consider
<br>
the likelihood of that to be too low to worry about
<br>
