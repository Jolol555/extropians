<p><p>I have to agree with Michael on this part at least.  Most rural people will 
<br>
generally give city people the benefit of the doubt if you don't already 
<br>
fall into some category that has a well-deserved reputation for being &quot;no 
<br>
good&quot;.  Odd or unusual people are usually viewed as a curiosities and are 
<br>
generally dealt with in a friendly manner.  By comparison, city people have 
<br>
a tendency to be condescending to rural people, or people they think fall 
<br>
into the rural redneck genre (which has happened to me, when I am in Nevada 
<br>
Native mode).  Having a &quot;suburban superiority complex&quot; will win you no 
<br>
friends in the back country.  As each culture has its own social protocols, 
<br>
I don't think comparing city-to-city or rural-to-rural interactions to be 
<br>
particularly relevant.
<br>
<p>Consider the Burning Man festival.  It is held deep in Basque rancher 
<br>
country, out in the Black Rock desert.  The people who live in the area 
<br>
generally have no problems with the festival.  Interestingly enough, most 
<br>
of the objections to the festival come from California environmentalists 
<br>
who have never even been to the place.  (It is an interesting anomaly that 
<br>
most environmentalists tend to be true city people i.e. people who have 
<br>
virtually no real experience with wilderness.)
