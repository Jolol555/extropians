<em>&gt; Alright guys, you are treading into my territory here -- 1960s manned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spaceflight trivia.  MOL was an AIR FORCE project; otherwise Michael got the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general idea right.  It was NOT an Agena.  
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, it was based on the Agena chassis, originally. Seems there were numerous
<br>
design changes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This makes it clear in pictures:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (BTW, Dan Roam's site above, &quot;Deep Cold&quot; is, well, cool.)  MOL (which was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also called &quot;KH 10&quot;) was cancelled when automation made mannning a really big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surveillance platform unnecessary.  The camera developed for MOL was used in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;Big Bird&quot; KH 11 satellites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More details can be found at Mark Wade's Encyclopaedia Astronautica;

</em><br>
<p>The thing is Greg, I've heard from several people who were Security Police and
<br>
ground crews at Vandenberg in the late 70's who all insist they had actually
<br>
launched MOL, that it was rather plain as day on various launch papers they
<br>
dealt with. Keeping the cover story of 'it was cancelled' seems to be a
<br>
recurring theme for cover stories in my experience in the USAF. That and the
<br>
double/triple cover of a) &quot;no, it doesn't exist&quot; and b) &quot;pssst, btw, its really
<br>
an alien spaceship&quot;, followed by c) &quot;if you saw it, you must be insane&quot;, were
<br>
the two recurring ones I saw when I was on active duty, depending on the level
<br>
of security needed, though the alien thing backfired on them and attracted more
<br>
attention instead... ;)
<br>
<p>I notice on the sites you mention, they never mentioned in the subcontracting
<br>
details who did the cameras (which was Itek).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And also, Mike, which Gemini mission actually swung a tethered Agena? (I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not doubting you; I just don't recall this . . .)
</em><br>
<p>Gemini 11 and 12, here's the links:

<br>
<p>and here's a link to a few pics from the missions:
<br>

<br>
Gemini 12:
<br>
<a href="http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/GT12/10074597.htm">http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/GT12/10074597.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Though, I was incorrect in the length of the tether. It was only 100 feet long.
<br>
It seems to look a lot longer in the photos... must be the rear-view mirror
<br>
effect from the periscope... ;)
