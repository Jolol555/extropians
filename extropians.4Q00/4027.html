<em>&gt; &gt;Some thermostats alter the absolute temp they switch on at depending on

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;variably based on time of day, and depending on whether the room is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;occupied, and occupied by particular people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they are making these decisions, however complex, from programming,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then they are finite-state. If they are altering their circuitry in response
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feedback loop from the environment, then they might be infinite-state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (analog).
</em><br>
<p>This is not consistent. A program is nothing more than a mathematical
<br>
circuit, and a circuit is really nothing more than a program encoded in
<br>
hardware. Either both are finite state or both are infinite state. What
<br>
you call analog is actually digital given a small enough level of
<br>
resolution.
<br>
<p>There is a finite number of neurons in the brain, a finite number of
<br>
synapses any one neuron can have at any given time, and a finite number
<br>
of neurons that a synapse can transmit to at any given time. Given a
<br>
finite life span of a brain, then the brain is a finite state piece of
<br>
hardware. Even if the brain is immortal, it is still finite state given
<br>
a finite lifespan to the universe. Thus, your argument is dismantled.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Human brains are not infinite state either, and you still have not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;provided any evidence that they are in fact conscious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Human brains are 'plastic' and rewire their circuitry. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not disputed by anybody, except by you it seems.
</em><br>
<p>see above. Being plastic is a far far cry from being infinite state.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Turing machines are hard-wired and cannot evince PHASIC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; TRANSIENT behaviour ... correct me if I am wrong? R.E.M.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as I would claim is a random-like phenomena because E-1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brains are still (in long evolution terms) changing from finite to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; infinite-state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; random-like is not the same as random.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are avoiding the point ... besides, perhaps pure randomness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is just a concept and does not exist in nature? Rapid eye movements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *seem* random in the same way that phasic transients *seem* random.
</em><br>
<p>Quantum indetermininance and entanglement phenomena display randomness.
<br>
<p>Since as I demonstrate above, human brains are not infinite state, I
<br>
rest my case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     &gt;Consciousness requires a degree of self-organisation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ah, first they must self organise, then they must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-disorganised... You seem confused.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In order to make an *independent* response to the environment some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree of &quot;self&quot; (organisation/ choice/ reaction) seems necessary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A robot that blindly follows a set of instructions and cannot make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent volitions has no &quot;self&quot; or central executive, but is just a slave machine.
</em><br>
<p>Your idea of a robot's potential capabilities (given future technology)
<br>
are far more narrow minded than my ideas of human mentation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, the ability of the brain to self-organise (or internally organise, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you dislike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the term &quot;self&quot;) is basic ..  and indeed, human embryos spend up to 24 hrs a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in REM before birth at certain stages, and well after birth the neuronal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circuits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form and reform. There is a massive volume of data on ontogeny ... if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insist I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will bore this list with reams of references?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Bore me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The debate seems to centre on the problems resolving Leibnitz Law ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that to be truly &quot;identical&quot; the two things in question must be fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interchangeable. Sense-data (experience) and the conscious sensor/ self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seem to be different types ... this is the problem for brain-mind identity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theorists. However, MVT explains the virtual sensor(gan), the phantom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; median
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; eye, which gives the persistent experience of self in terms of generation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; potential signals &amp;c) of the *same* generic neuronal information as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense-data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (contents of consciousness).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I don't think so. Identity is not an issue of consciousness, it is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;issue of discretion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The loci of experience, and the mechanisms that give rise to it are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very pertinent to the parallel discussion about uploading &amp;c. Cogito ergo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sum.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but that has nothing to do with a debate about human versus AI
<br>
'conciousness'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is a major reason why MVT is important, most theories of mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Descartes' dualist account) fail on this point. Brains are necessary, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sufficient for consciousness (they could be in mu-state ... don't you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; agree?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;You have to be kidding. Brainless awareness? Excuse me? Cites please,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cites.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I am saying is that brain-dead (mu-state) means NO awareness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The brain is not only a circuit, but needs to be in infinite state. I tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think insect neuronal clusters, and even hagfish &amp; lampreys (E-2 brains)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not conscious. If the word conscious is a problem, use sentience or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even qualify as &quot;self-referential consciousness.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Since a brain is not an infinite state entity, your statement is
<br>
incorrect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As to whether I can *prove* that you are conscious (whoever &quot;me/ you&quot; are)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ... I don't want to get bogged down in individual cases because of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of solipsism. Do you accept that dreams happen? If you do, then you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allowing me that the dreamers (in general, whether birds, mammal, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *you*)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you claim that dreams are anything more than automated backup/sorting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of buffer data stored in short term memory?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I agree with Globus (Real Time Hypothesis) that REM occurs during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but is harder to detect, and with Aristotle that we are nearer to our true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;self&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when dreaming and mentation is not interrupted by external 'noise.' I also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partly with Freud, and think that dreams are a way of rehearsing behaviour
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as sex) without taking risk of actually engaging in the world. We build and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; models of reality when dreaming ... I also think that consolidation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reinforcement of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory (and discard activity) happens during dream, both REM and non-REM.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your view is too narrow, and ignores loads of evidence. But at least you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dreams (a form of conscious event) occur!
</em><br>
<p>Rehearsing is another possible use of rem. Given your reference to
<br>
foetal rem behavior, this can easily, though, be explained as the fetus
<br>
learning to sort through and make sense of sensory data, creating
<br>
circuitry to deal with what is at first incomprehensible mishmash. How
<br>
would you feel if the only input you received for days on end was like a
<br>
combination of a static picture with twenty different stations mixed
<br>
together? Making sense of input by trying out various neural
<br>
configurations until one is comprehensible seems to fit the data well.
