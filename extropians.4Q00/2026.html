Eliezer, you are a gentleman and a scholar.  I am honored to
<br>
have made your acquaintance.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, I see many parallels between current AI research
<br>
and the researchers into nuclear fission in the 1930s.  The
<br>
task of AI is much more difficult, but in both cases, the dangers
<br>
and rewards are great.  Altho inherently dangerous, I believe
<br>
it *is* possible and logical to use the term &quot;safety&quot; in the same
<br>
sentence with AI, just as much as it was in the 30s with nukes.
<br>
<p>Carry on, yall!  spike
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Spike, I realize that I used to be somewhat cavalier about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issue of Friendly AI...
</em><br>
<p>p.s. Eliezer, no apologies necessary.  You, like the rest of us,
<br>
are entitled to a youthful indiscretion or two, so long as they
<br>
are *safely* in the distant past.  {8^D
