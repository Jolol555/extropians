<em>&gt; I will not rise to any of Michael's tempting bait (yum), but there's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nugget of gold here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There is a significant difference between individualism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; socio/psychological killers, liberty is not about nihilism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolutely true, and I never said it was.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will repeat what I said, broken down, with annotation:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Pure individualism        &lt;do what thou wilt, plain and simple&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) in its rawest form        &lt;hmm... what the *hell* is going on? looks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weird to me&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) is hard to distinguish    &lt;not impossible, _hard_ for J. Random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person on the street&gt;
</em><br>
<p>For J Random Ignoramus who has been fed Union, DNC, and Welfare State
<br>
media garbage, there is a significant memetic barrier to overcome, I
<br>
will grant, at least, it seems, with many city dwellers. I do not see
<br>
much difficulty for residents of rural areas to distinguish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4) from psychopathology      &lt;bad craziness&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5) unless the observer       &lt;the person trying to gauge how to respond&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6) has confidence            &lt;justified or not&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 7) in the shared values      &lt;I figure most people will eat the pie, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throw it in my face&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 8) of the observed.          &lt;the person doing what he wilt&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, of course, but as I said above, this is typically a city dweller
<br>
response, and given rat experiments and human experiments on crowding
<br>
and sensory inundation, I would venture that a large percentage of city
<br>
dwellers are at least minimally paranoid psychotics from trying to deal
<br>
with city stresses. I have found that its far easier for rural resident
<br>
A from Montana to trust rural resident B from New Hampshire than for
<br>
city resident A from one side of Boston to trust city resident B from
<br>
the other side of Boston. Could it simply be that the shared values of
<br>
city dwellers are values of distrust of the individual in favor of
<br>
bureaucratic authority?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pick any part of this apart, Michael. Please go by the numbers, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are a lot of assumptions and nominalizations here; I hope you won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waste time quibbling over semantics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean, really, haven't you ever freaked a mundane? You know what I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about, don't you?
</em><br>
<p>I do freak petty socio/communo-fascists all the time.
