<p>I can respect this point of view, but I don't agree with it.
<br>
<p>I was going through life with the opinion that I'll never find the right
<br>
person for marriage. But this was because I was looking in the wrong
<br>
places (night clubs, work, travel etc). When I found the Extropy
<br>
Institute mailinglist, I saw that this could be the right place for
<br>
finding the man I could marry. I don't mean that this was the only
<br>
reason I subscribed the mailinglist for, though :-) I just saw the
<br>
possibility. And it turned out that I had really found the right place:
<br>
After a long time of loneliness, I found the right person there.
<br>
<p>I don't think that an open relationship makes a marriage more
<br>
progressive in an extropian kind of way. I admit, I could be biased here
<br>
but I never got the notion from open relationship marriages that they
<br>
really worked. I always got the impression that at least one person in
<br>
those relationships was having a &quot;looking for an emergency exit&quot; in
<br>
mind.
<br>
In my opinion, open relationships are the easy way of being married.
<br>
It's easy and distracting from the things an Extropian should (in my
<br>
opinion) really focus on: Being a catalyst for new ideas, finding
<br>
solutions for life-threatening problems, exploring the universe in a
<br>
scientific kind of way. Two Extropians who &quot;join forces&quot; have a much
<br>
greater impact here. And this impact is even more increased if the two
<br>
people who are involved really know each other, which often allows
<br>
balancing out one person's weaknesses with the other person's strengths.
<br>
<p>Of course, it was much easier for me, a female Extropian, to find a man
<br>
I could marry as it is for extropian men.
