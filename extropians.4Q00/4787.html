<p><em>&gt;Morgana came running in to Jodie, crying. After Jodie managed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;calm her down, Morgana explained that they'd said on the show that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the sun was going to explode and swallow the earth in 5 billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years. She was terrified! She woke up in the night with nightmares
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about it.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;So today, I'm expounding at length on visions of colonising the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stars, jupiter brains, and all the rest. Also, we took some time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to discuss just how long 5 billion years is, finding out that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have a little time up our sleeve after all.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Still, she takes the threat seriously. When she found out about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;death, about a year ago or more I think, I told her about life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extension and what I think will be happening in her life time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which she was very happy with. Since then, she's been ruminating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on that a lot. She told me this morning that we'd probably be dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before the sun explodes, but we might not be.
</em><br>
<p>Tell her that one day humans will live on millions of worlds and
<br>
that we will know all about the day that the sun will explode long
<br>
before it happens, and that we all will have safely moved away
<br>
before then. 
<br>
<p>But we will watch and remember.
<br>
<p>There is an old joke about this that goes like this:
<br>
<p>A physicist is giving a lecture on the sun, and concludes his talk
<br>
saying the sun will explode in 5 billion years.
<br>
<p>A man jumps up from the back of the room and in a terrified voice
<br>
says &quot;HOW LONG?????&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;About 5 billion years&quot; the physicist answers.
<br>
<p>&quot; Oh Thank God&quot; the man says greatly relieved, &quot; I thought you said
<br>
5 MILLION&quot;.
