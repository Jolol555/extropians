<p>
Sarfatti is also mentioned in RAW's Cosmic Trigger Vol. 1 and claims to have
<br>
written major portions of Gray Zukav's &quot;Dancing Wu Li Masters&quot;.  I contacted
<br>
him once and he blew me off.  He was only interested in obtaining some
<br>
article where I had read his name and didn't know that it was published.  He
<br>
is a close friend of Fred Alan Wolf and I think he hangs at Cafe Trieste
<br>
here in San Fran's North Beach.
<br>
<p>I once heard Fred Alan Wolf speak.  He was a sham.  He had a cheesy
<br>
multimedia slideshow he used to tell us how he used physics to define the
<br>
soul.  The worst part was that he used quantum physics and four dimensions.
<br>
So I asked him what about the other six dimensions that super string theory
<br>
mentions and it threw him for a loop because it didn't fit into his theory.
<br>
So he made a joke.  I felt he was just in love with playing to an audience.
<br>
<p>So, I'd ignore both of them for the most part.
