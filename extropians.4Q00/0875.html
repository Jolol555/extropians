</em><br>
<p>Ouch.  This is quite likely what the perp set about his/her victim. 
<br>
Exactly when and how, especially in the light of possible immortality,
<br>
can you tell that a given individual is totally unredeemable now and for
<br>
all time?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; How could a sentient, caring person live with themself knowing they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; had murdered another person? Denial? That wasn't the &quot;real&quot; me?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A sentient, caring person can come to appreciate the enormity of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wrongness of the act if properly reformed and never perform such an act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; again.  Many acts short of murder but also quite heinous cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; undone.  At best one can make what poor atonement one can and resolve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; never to perform in such a way again.  Or do you believe all wrong-doers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should be executed given your logic?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not all wrong doers, but the cost to incarcerate an incorrigible murderer for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life is so great you might as well just offer a $3 million dollar reward for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to turn themselves in. You'd save more money that way. Society practices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the morals it can afford. I can't afford YOUR morals, which seem intent on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rewarding murderers with lifetime maximum security bed and breakfast services,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nor can society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Exactly when is a murder &quot;incorrigible&quot;?  Especially given near-term
<br>
techniques and time?  I am not at all sure any of can afford the morals
<br>
we as individuals and as a society practice today for too much longer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How can a sentient, caring person condemn another human being to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; irreversible and irretrievable death?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thats just it: murderers are not sentient caring people (not manslaughterers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc), else they would not murder people. They typically do not recognise others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as 'real', or at least as 'real' or important as themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There you are talking about a psychotic.  That is a mental condition,
<br>
not a moral one.  And it is a mental condition that with the advent of
<br>
nano-medicine we most likely can cure.  So why would you justify
<br>
murdering someone for a curable condition?   The more common type of
<br>
murder is committed by someone like you or me who believes that the
<br>
victim &quot;just needs killin&quot;.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This could also lead to a dilemma: What if someone decided to kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; someone knowing the worst that could happen is that the &quot;bad part&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; would be purged. They would still accomplish their task.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is not that simple by far.  There is no &quot;bad part&quot;.  This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strawman.  Their task was a misaligned way of acheiving some goal.  Cure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the misalignment if you can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And who do you suggest decide how the fixing gets done and by whome? By
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments that kill far more people than individuals do? By doctors who kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more people from negligence every year than are murdered intentionally? Show me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone who knows what the hell they are doing first. Until you get such people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can do that job, those that offend should be excised from society. Life is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the highest ethic, liberty is at least coequal to it. 'Death is not the worst of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evils'.  What is wrong about murder is not the theft of life, but of liberty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life being merely one of many liberties the individual posesses, and the one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without which the rest are moot. One who commits such an act surrenders their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That no one knows what they hell they are doing totally is precisely why
<br>
an irrevocable death penalty makes far less sense than putting the
<br>
person on ice (figuratively or literally for a while). 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Most likely many such murders would be avoided by better psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and sociological practices before the fact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I doubt it very much. Better education, more stable upbringing, these would make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a difference for most. The rest, those who are 'wired wrong', if you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rewire them, eliminating them from the gene pool is the best you can do.
</em><br>
<p>If they are &quot;wired wrong&quot; then they are not responsible and need to be
<br>
cured, not murdered.
