<em>&gt; Why is it exactly that we don't have a Death Ray?
</em><br>
<p>Define &quot;Death Ray&quot;.  Would the neutron bomb, supposedly capable of
<br>
wiping out all life in an area while leaving buildings and other
<br>
infrastructure intact, count?  Or perhaps you mean something that
<br>
disentigrates all matter in its path, and/or with a lot more precision
<br>
than an area effect bomb.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You'd think that
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The US military is testing anti-missile lasers, whose power sources are
<br>
large enough to take up most of a large jet.  If they can destroy
<br>
missiles, their effect on unarmored infantry would probably be similar
<br>
to what you're looking for...but this would be like swatting flies with
<br>
a sledgehammer.  Why bother with an expensive death ray when some
<br>
bullets would render the enemy just as dead?  Similar logic applies to
<br>
antivehicular weaponry.
