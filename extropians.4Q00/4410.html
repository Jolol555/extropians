<em>&gt;&gt;That's right, I was there

<p><em>&gt;&gt;I've been on the Internet since administrators used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to ask you to keep off their systems during the day
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;remember spending alot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of time at the site at CERN and playing with an interesting text
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;based system  the creator was calling the world wide web. I still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;have the E-mail I got back from him thanking me for my comments
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and telling me they were working on a GUI for it, and after that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;he hoped it would really take off... Need I even bother
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mentioning his name?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Puh-lease....
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I had a top-secret clearance and was building Arpanet before you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knew what a network was.  I invented network technology and helped
</em><br>
<em>&gt;debug protocols before the Internet converted to TCP/IP.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;debuged network links before we had a connection to Europe.  I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an admin years before ISPs like yours (The Well) were allowed on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Internet.  I was probably one of those admins who asked you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;users to stay out of my way.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Your talk of the &quot;early days&quot; is about two decades too late to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impress me.
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't out to impress you Harvey, I've seen your resume and it's
<br>
very impressive.
<br>
<p>I've held a few clearances myself, try EA6-A/B and PRP program for
<br>
buzz words and I got out of the military in 1979. I never said the
<br>
WELL and 1989 were my first exposure to the Internet or ARPANET.
