<p>Perzackly.  Current practice polarizes the voters in such a way that the
<br>
two-party system stays on top, and the closeness of this election will
<br>
lead to cries of &quot;Nader split the liberal vote and caused this mess!&quot; 
<br>
(By that logic, Slick Wille's ascendancy was H. Wingnut Perot's fault.)

<br>
<em>&gt; I do think there are ways of improving a democracy to allow more winners
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (in terms of preferences). This was the kind of discussion I was hoping for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, rather than a blow by blow account of events. However, clearly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will of the people on this List has spoken, so I withdraw my request to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hold back from chatting about the subject. Besides, some of the posts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *have* added to what you'll find elsewhere.
</em><br>
<p>Discover magazine has a *very* timely article on superior means of
<br>
voting
<br>
at <a href="http://www.discover.com/nov_00/gthere.html?article=featbestman.html">http://www.discover.com/nov_00/gthere.html?article=featbestman.html</a>
<br>
<p>The current system is the plurality vote- each ballot may select only
<br>
one candidate, and the one with the most votes wins.  We can see how
<br>
poorly this has served.
<br>
<p>Another method is approval voting, where you may select as many
<br>
candidates as you wish- say, Bush, Browne, and Hagelin.  The winner is
<br>
still the one that received the most votes, but the voters have more
<br>
choices- and can hedge their bets.  If you feel a particular candidate
<br>
is dangerous, you might vote for everyone *but* him, but also third
<br>
parties can be voted for without &quot;throwing away&quot; your vote. Think what
<br>
this would do for the LP (and also, alas, for the Greens).
<br>
<p>More mathematically accurate is the Borda count, where the voter ranks
<br>
all the candidates in preferred order 1,2,3... n.  The first ranking
<br>
gives n points, second rank is n-1, etc.
<br>
<p>The Borda count is better at resolving ties, but requires a bit more
<br>
effort (and numeracy!) on the voter's part than the approval vote. 
<br>
Either would be a vast improvement over the status quo, but are unlikely
<br>
to come about because they would open up the field to third parties, a
<br>
horror that the republicrats and democans will always unite to oppose.
