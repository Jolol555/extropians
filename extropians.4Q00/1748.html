From: &quot;Nick Bostrom&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:nick@nickbostrom.com?Subject=Re:%20Fermi%20Paradox%20in%20the%20news&In-Reply-To=&lt;00aa01c041f0$914be300$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">nick@nickbostrom.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Suppose we know that the true theory of everything is of the form T, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it has one free parameter, a physical constant k that, on theoretical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grounds, can take on any integer value between 1 and 1,000,000. But there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no a priori ground, let's assume, why k should have one of these values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than another. So by a principle of indifference, we assign each of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these possibilities an equal probability. Now consider the specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypotheses Tn:=&quot;T and k=n&quot; for n=1, ..., 1,000,000. Probability calculus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then implies that the probability of Tn &lt;= 1/1,000,000. In other words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each of these specific hypotheses must be highly a priori improbable since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are mutually exclusive and their combined probability cannot exceed
</em><br>
1.
<br>
<p>But, again, why should we reason this way at all?  Why should we be of the
<br>
belief that since we are able to attach a numerical value to a property of
<br>
the universe, it is therefore a 'variable'?  On what sort of theoretical
<br>
grounds can you presume to assign a particular set of integer values to
<br>
physical constants?
<br>
<p>There's a little bit of devil's advocacy going on here-- I admit to being a
<br>
proponent of multiverse theories of reality (ALL things happened is as
<br>
logically consistent in my mind and NO things happened,) but even in the
<br>
context of many worlds theorems, I wonder why we should consider 'alternate
<br>
numbers' as being logical possible place-holders for physical constants.
<br>
<p>This is one step beyond what I imagine the human mind is capable of
<br>
attaching much significance to, but can we hypothesize about a
<br>
non-mathematical template for reality?  Attaching numbers to processes as a
<br>
means of measuring fundamental building blocks and relative ratios of values
<br>
seems to reference the intrinsic fabric of our existence-- but I wonder if
<br>
our adherence to numbers as the ultimate rules of reality doesn't put us
<br>
into arbitrary mindsets with regards to possible existence scenarios.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Even if it was in some sense physically necessary that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; k=42925, so that the physical chance of k=42925 is 1, this is compatible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with our prior epistemic probability of k=42925 being very small.
</em><br>
<p>Not following you here.  Again: why should we reason that since other
<br>
numbers exist, they are (even a priori cognitively) available to said
<br>
constant?
<br>
<p><p>Thanks.
