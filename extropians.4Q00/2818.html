<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; sf-stories in Nature, where a massive epidemic wiped out everybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; without Tay Sachs-genes).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I suppose that if that future came to pass, then in fact people would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; applaud that devotion to genetic diversity in the past.  However from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our present perspective we don't know that this will happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Being heterozygote for cystic fibrosis apparently confers an advantage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against cholera. But if somebody tried marketing a cholera medication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that as a side effect had the effects of CF (including the much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shortened lifespan) I guess no agency would approve it and nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nobody would want to take it. There are better ways of treating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point above is more about whether we should accept all changes than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether a certain change *could* be beneficial. Being born with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cross on your forehead (due to parents having odd religious views)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *could* be beneficial in some circumstances, but most likely not and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would impose quite a bit on the child.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Body modifications of infants unable to make decisions happen quite often.  One
<br>
of the most obvious examples is circumcision.  Admittedly, being hidden by a
<br>
loincloth, it is not the same as being branded on the face.
<br>
<p>If there are true uploads in the extropic sense, then it might be like a Greg
<br>
Bear novel where infants are uploaded upon in- or conception.  Then infants
<br>
develop in a virtual world and choose their body or bodies later.
<br>
<p>In the space of two or three generations, we could see everything change, or
<br>
not, and in the space of three hundred generations, we could observe each.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Taking risks is necessary, but taking unnecessary risks is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; irrational.
</em><br>
<p>True.  Almost not any human is completely rational in a logically objective
<br>
sense, or most are in their own sense, with none two the same.  A rationale is a
<br>
state of mind.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;The same goes for genetic modifications; I really doubt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; many parents would select highly risky treatments for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; children-to-be. That is not really the issue here, but how to handle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the fact that if parents select genes they might create initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; conditions that are adverse to the person that later develops. Should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; there exist some form of feedback or compensation system so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; children can express their rights once they have become persons? It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; not an issue of banning certain forms of radical changes, but rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; making parents aware of the different potential costs of different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; changes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What about a parent who takes his child into space on some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; irreversible journey (say, a traditional SF generation ship to the stars)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Should children conceived on such a trip be able to sue their parents?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Should the children on the Mayflower have sued their parents for exposing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them to the hardships of the New World?  I don't think we can categorize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such journeys into necessary vs unnecessary risks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isn't this a very different problem?

<p>About lawsuits, people generally have the right to raise their children how they
<br>
would, there are certain rules about abuse and neglect.  About lawsuits, in a
<br>
suit there are two sides, I think you can find a lawyer to sue anybody, more or
<br>
less.
<br>
<p>I started reading this book about the genome called _Genome_, it tells me a lot
<br>
I did not know.  I don't have any biology background except for science-fiction
<br>
immersion and the anatomy plates.  Anyways, at some point we can tell the
<br>
computer what enzymes we want and thus print RNA to make them, in the comfort of
<br>
our own homes.  Thus any demyelinization of the neuron could be stopped, as
<br>
well, any tumors proactively prevented, and cells' multiplication delimited.
<br>
<p>As soon as the zygote is fertilized, and then it multiplies, there is the genome
<br>
for that future person, if it is born.  If the gene absolutely predicts massive
<br>
congenital birth defects, it is perhaps better to use a different fertilized
<br>
zygote that has a better chance of a happy development and maturity.  As soon as
<br>
the zygote is then manipulated, then it too easily leads to the spiral of
<br>
eugenics.
<br>
<p>If adults choose to modify their own genetic code, so be it.  If they are not
<br>
then mules, then they could pass it as humans.  Some forms of genetic
<br>
modification of a human would make it not human, more or less.
<br>
<p>Tampering with the genetic code is parallel to evolution, except where evolution
<br>
is the more or less randomized sum result of incremental mutation, purposeful
<br>
manipulation of the genetic code is an extremely powerful action, thus
<br>
dangerous, morally and perhaps for the rest of the species, and in the case of
<br>
the manipulation gone wrong, dangerous for the being whose genes were changed.
<br>
<p>Humans selectively interbreed on a more-or-less conscious level, thus some
<br>
30,000 generations bring us from using stone or bone tools to chip chert to
<br>
using nanoprobes to shape bones.
