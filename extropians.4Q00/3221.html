The Autoerotic Asphyxiation Syndrome In Adolescent and Young Adult Males
<br>
<a href="http://members.aol.com/bj022038/">http://members.aol.com/bj022038/</a>
<br>
Autoerotic asphyxia is the practice of inducing cerebral anoxia, usually
<br>
by means of self-applied ligatures or suffocating devices, while the
<br>
individual masturbates to orgasm.

dying

This file contains four separate documents on the controversial subject of
<br>
erotic asphyxiation. The first document, &quot;The Medical Realities of Breath
<br>
Control Play&quot; by Jay Wiseman, argues that this type of play is inherently
<br>
dangerous and always potentially deadly. The second document, &quot;Please Be
<br>
Tender When You Cut Me Down&quot; by Knud Romer, discusses the phenomenon of
<br>
erotic asphyxiation from a historical/academic perspective. The third
<br>
document, &quot;When All is Said and Done, Life Kills Your Ass&quot; by Michael
<br>
Decker, sheds insight into what erotic asphxiation offers to the people
<br>
who are drawn to it. The fourth document is a summary of some safety
<br>
advice on erotic asphyxiation, drawn from various internet articles on the
<br>
subject. A brief bibliography concludes this file.

3M TA3
<br>
<p>You cannot stay on the summit forever; you have to come down
<br>
again. So why bother in the first place? Just this: What is above
<br>
knows what is below, but what is below does not know what is
<br>
above. One climbs, one sees. One descends, one sees no
<br>
longer, but one has seen. There is an art of conducting oneself
<br>
in the lower regions by the memory of what one saw higher up.
<br>
When one can no longer see, one can at least still know.
