<p>I don't have the books to hand, but my guess is that MacLeod explicitly
<br>
sets up a variety of kinda kneejerk or ideological reactions to all manner
<br>
of things that are often later reversed or at least modified as the
<br>
characters learn more, and certainly as the reader sees more variations
<br>
than any of the characters do. You might well be correct that this
<br>
anti-upload/non-humanoid prejudice seems reinforced by his extant novels,
<br>
but I think that's just an accident of the stories he's happened to tell.
<br>
(Which, granted, might be sufficient for your purposes.) There's no one,
<br>
consistent `line' being run in his work (as there is, maybe, in Asimov's).
<br>
You might as well say he argues for nano Difference Engines in preference
<br>
to electronic computers, but again that's just an accidental side-effect (a
<br>
rather clever and amusing one) of the gloabl EM pulse weapons used in one
<br>
of the books.
