<p>This is not really my field of interest, but a simple thought
<br>
experiment should be a good start. Could I stop being straight if I
<br>
wanted to? Nope. Maybe swing both ways somewhat, but unless I get some
<br>
female, um, companionship now and then, I'm not completely fulfilled.
<br>
Can you stop being gay if you wanted to? I would guess nope and ditto
<br>
but you tell me.
<br>
<p>I understand the reluctance to entertain the possibity that homosexuality
<br>
has a biological component. That implies that all those creepy evolutionary
<br>
psychologists have been more right than we like to admit and gender isn't
<br>
as much of a social construct was we would like it to be. On the other hand,
<br>
that cuts both ways. If homosexuality is biological, then hating and oppressing
<br>
homosexuals becomes more akin to hating and oppressing asians or diabetics or
<br>
people with green eyes rather than hating and oppressing punk-rockers, 
<br>
body piercing afficionados, and Jerry Lewis fans. Homosexuality becomes
<br>
a component of you rather than a lifestyle choice.
<br>
<p>Anyway, since you asked, my next message to this list is going to be sixteen
<br>
abstracts and/or references to journal articles published since 1990 and 
<br>
retrieved via www.webofscience.com. All those of you who aren't interested
<br>
in this issue, be warned-- it's going to be a looong message.
<br>
<p>As I said, this isn't really my field, so I don't know how many of
<br>
these have been 'debunked'. I do think that the X-chromosome sattelite
<br>
theory may have been... someone who is curious about the question could
<br>
pursue it further by repeating my WebOfScience query and then
<br>
forward-tracking these citations to even more recent articles that
<br>
reference *them* (Isn't science cool? They invented a paper-n-ink
<br>
usenet almost two centuries before the electronic version came along)
