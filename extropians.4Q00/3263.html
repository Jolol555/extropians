<em>&gt; The Libertarian party relies *supremely* upon substantial reduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the power of the Federal Government.  Without reduction of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power of the Federal Government, only shadows of Libertarians' goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be achieved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Personally, I agree with L. Neil Smith.  The Libertarian party will not
<br>
be a force to be reckoned with until every single person who comes in
<br>
contact with it knows that it stands squarely for individual rights and
<br>
especially for the strong and whole-hearted enforcement of the Bill of
<br>
Rights.  As long as the party mealy-mouths about wanting to reduce the
<br>
power of Federal government and other side-effects of what is really
<br>
crucial, it can be easily coopted by the mainline parties.  The
<br>
Libertarian party is for reduced government because and only because it
<br>
is for seeing individual rights and their protection as the only
<br>
legitimate reason for having any government at all (if even this is a
<br>
worthwhile reason).  It is against the initiation of physical force
<br>
because all such is a violation of individual rights.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I dislike the religious component of the Republican party as much as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone.  I'm an atheist living in Houston, and the vast number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; churches here gives me the heebie geebies.  It *scares* me when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Republicans like George Bush Sr. say that they don't think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atheists should have a voice in American politics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It scares me too.  Until I remember that the office of President
<br>
requires that one upholds the Constitution.  That includes the First
<br>
Amendment.  But then I remember who interprets the Constitution. And I
<br>
remember that all elected officials swear to uphold the Constitution and
<br>
most of them install copies in their bathroom that regularly need to be
<br>
replendished.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the Republicans are the only ones even *willing to entertain* a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduction of taxes and a corresponding decrease in the size of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Federal Government.  As the Government's size decreases, they'll have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no choice but to cut out more and more Government programs.  They'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have no choice but to reduce their expensive war on drugs.  I may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really like the goals of religious conservatives, but I can see how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working with them, for now, can put us in a position to become a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarian country.
</em><br>
<p><p>Sure they will &quot;entertain&quot; a reduction in how much of your money the
<br>
will steal in order to take away more of your rights than they have any
<br>
intention of acknowledging, much less protecting.  The Republicans will
<br>
never, ever, reduce their drain on the economy enough to undermine their
<br>
own favorite tyrannies against the American people they claim to serve.
