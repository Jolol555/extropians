Good question. Your previous post inspired me because I have heard many 
<br>
professional philosophers have argued that their value to society is because 
<br>
their learning and teaching, somehow serves the greater good.  Mechanical 
<br>
Engineering surely does serve the good of society when it is harnessed, 
<br>
idealistically or philosophically, interesting and valuable goals. 
<br>
Extropianism and Transhumanism seem to seek a greater good. Human empowerment 
<br>
and the need to transcend warfare and death and disease appear to be laudable 
<br>
goals. Keep up the good work!

<p>&lt;&lt; I don't understand how my article inspired those questions, but...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Does mechanical engineering &quot;owe anything, as a discipline, to promote the
<br>
&nbsp;greater good?&quot;  I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but just to show that
<br>
&nbsp;philosophy can be considered just as mechanical engineering, as a discipline
<br>
&nbsp;or a body of knowledge.  In either case, people use them for good or ill.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Philosophies vary a lot too.  One shouldn't assume that all of them are
<br>
&nbsp;equal or as useful or as valid.  In this vein, it's my belief that
<br>
&nbsp;philosophy's purpose, against which it can't be measured, is to help
<br>
&nbsp;individuals to live life.  So in a sense, it should be for the good, though
<br>
&nbsp;there is a lot of difference between different people and different
<br>
&nbsp;philosophical systems over what is good.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Cheers!
