<p><em>&gt;Why would you conclude, Darin, that ETI,s would use low-power signals and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;avoid making their presence known? Why should they care, and why need they
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt;mindful of us, if they exist?
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't follow from their being mindful of us, anymore then the
<br>
undetectability of our radio signals to an 18th century scientist would. It
<br>
follows from simple efficiency.
<br>
<p>If I'm sending over interstellar distances, I would want to use the least
<br>
amount of power possible over the least amount of time. Now, given that I,
<br>
as an &quot;average&quot; SI, have the ability to build pretty much whatever I want
<br>
(:)), I would use a tiny fraction of the vast amounts of computing power
<br>
available to me to allow me to use extreme  amounts of data compression.
<br>
Remember, a digital PCS cell phone data signal would be completely
<br>
indistinguishable from thermal noise to any radio scientist, right up to
<br>
around the 1930s. And that's less then a 50 year gap in technology. And it
<br>
was only the findings in the mathematics of information theory that would
<br>
allow them to even consider a noisy signal as compressed information.
<br>
<p>If I know how to do interstellar communication using only a
<br>
fraction-of-a-volt tight-beam phased-frequency signal that transmits data at
<br>
something like 100 Mbits per second, why on EARTH would I want to use a 5
<br>
million volt 3-bits-per-second spoken-audio-or-equivalent-thereof signal
<br>
visible across 90 degrees of sky?
<br>
<p>Unless of course, I WANTED to speak to 18th century radio scientists :)
<br>
<p>It's not that they're mindful of us. It's the exact opposite. They can't be
<br>
bothered to dumb themselves down to the point where we could detect them.
<br>
<p>Another good example is found right here in our own solar system. The
<br>
communications from the Voyager spacecraft: the closest thing to
<br>
interstellar data communication we have practical experience with.
<br>
<p>Voyager transmits a data signal with a signal strength of well less then a
<br>
volt, from well beyond the orbit of Pluto. The only reason we can detect it
<br>
is because we know to a VERY high precision exactly where in the sky it is,
<br>
and because we have several radio telescopes doing radio interferometry on
<br>
that point in the sky, and even then it can take weeks of computer time to
<br>
dig the signal out of the background noise.
<br>
<p>Everybody on Earth is in direct line of sight of Voyager's transmissions
<br>
here. But even the Seti observations probably couldn't pick Voyager out of
<br>
the sky if they didn't know it was there.
<br>
<p>Now you may argue that we operate within Voyager's power constraints because
<br>
we have to, and that an SI could very well choose to be more extravagant. I
<br>
would have to disagree. I find it highly unlikely that the design of an SI's
<br>
communications systems would be done by conscious subsystems at all.
<br>
Automated Engineering, at least the primitive beginnings we've made of it,
<br>
is nothing if not efficient.
<br>
<p>Now, far be it from me to claim to know the mind of an SI, or even of a
<br>
significantly &gt;H subsystem of an SI, but I can make a rough guess of it's
<br>
capabilities, and I know this: if they wanted to be extravagant in their use
<br>
of signal strength, we would see it. Forget alien television signals, we'd
<br>
be seeing stellar-sized fusion pumped MASERs, and pulse modulated
<br>
supernovae. Barring FTL communications, there's no better way to get a
<br>
message out to a galaxy then a couple trillion tons of smart dust
<br>
surrounding a supernova flickering out a Morse signal :)).
<br>
<p>In conclusion, I take SI capabilities seriously, and I don't see any when I
<br>
look up into the night sky. That's why I think they'd use low powered
<br>
signals.
