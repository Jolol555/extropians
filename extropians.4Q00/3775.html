<em>&gt; As someone else (Hal, I think) pointed out, they could say the same about you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the libertarian's favorite slogans is &quot;taxation is theft&quot;, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counter is &quot;property is theft&quot;. Who's right? Depends on your values, actually.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you think property rights are the basis of civilization, you'd say the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; former. If you think private property is the basis for hierarchical enslavement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the masses, you'd say the latter. By what standard is anything judged? My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standards aren't accepted by everyone.
</em><br>
<p>Property is theft from whom?  You can steal if no one has any ownership
<br>
rights.  :-)  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Simple.  They want to not only make their own mind up but having decided
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that X is good they would like to force my compliance at gunpoint.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;have no intention of forcing them to do anything at all.  If we have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;logic in common then I guess little more than self-defense of one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;person and space or avoidance of one another would be left.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Smart-ass. But, that's meant in a good way, actually.
</em><br>
<p>How so?  I expressed the difference in philosophies and the consequences
<br>
if people truly have no basic principles or objective reality to fall
<br>
back on to reach agreement.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Ah, I forgot, there I go again, using logic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd say yes, it does mean someone must sacrifice themselves for this guy.
</em><br>
<p>Why must they?  Says who?  And are those they say so correct?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, you use the word enslave. You are re-defining a common word, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempting to substitute that altered definition into the conversation as though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it were the original, common meaning. The word slavery (in common usage) does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NOT denote being required to do some sort of service for others. 
</em><br>
<p>Being required to do service for others without pay or compensation or
<br>
choice is as close to being enslaved as I want to go.  At the least you
<br>
would have to admit this is thievery of another's time, energy and
<br>
resources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the weakest parts of any libertarian arguments, the failure to make an argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using commonly accepted definitions. 
</em><br>
<p>If you define the above as not enslavement and perfectly ok then it is
<br>
not libertarian definitions that should be questioned.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Of course people think slavery is bad. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they also don't think requiring people to 'give back' is slavery. And this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where we lose people who could potentially help us. 
</em><br>
<p>Give back?  This assumes one took something unfairly in the first
<br>
place.  &quot;Give back&quot; sounds like a justice claim.  But by what notions of
<br>
justice?  This itself is a much more prejudicial and questionable use of
<br>
words than what you are calling me (and libertarians generally) on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(Before you ask, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally would say he is asking for something to which he has no right, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know that I'd consciously call it slavery.)
</em><br>
<p>OK.  So if he has no right to it but you are forced by government to
<br>
comply anyway then your rights have been violated.  Yes?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;Someone to take care of them?  Doesn't that translate to this guy saying he has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right to enslave others for his benefit?  If &gt;so then why should any decent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people take such a statement seriously?   In fact increased freedom has done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more to &gt;increase the well-being of all elements of society than any amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chaining the more able to the needs of the less able.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the problem is cross purposes. You're arguing against what (I think) you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think I'm saying, that government is ok, etc. What I'm doing, though, is saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are people who don't agree with you, and they do wield power. I once saw a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; priest make a very strong chain of logic showing that Christ was God. My point?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you buy the basic proposition that God exists, all else falls into place.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  By that basic assumption Christ was God.  But then so was Krisna
<br>
and many others by the same logic.  OK.  It is a pointless aside.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Logic by itself is NOT enough, you have to agree on basic points of reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And, largely libertarians are in a minority on what's right and wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Those that have any claim of speaking intelligently about right and
<br>
wrong are in an even greater minority. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words in ways that others don't (slavery, plunder, etc. ) and then expect them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to agree with us. They may, for a while, but then they realize we were doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something they didn't know, and they not only no longer agree, they think we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deceptive, stupid etc. We lose ground. We need to be able to deal with things as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are, and move forward.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think this is the case at all.  The words above are well used
<br>
for the things they are used to describe.  They are not arbitrary.  That
<br>
most people don't use those words for those things is more from not
<br>
thinking about the subject much or not seeing the same implications than
<br>
anything else.  Human conversation and communication isn't about just
<br>
reacting to words mindlessly. Of course most people don't fully qualify
<br>
as having human conversation much of the time.  OK.  I am getting
<br>
cynical now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;You seem to have studiously missed the point.  I made a statement about what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think is the best that can be achieved and  &gt;that historically seems best.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim that I have prejudiced the conversation but you have not shown this. I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; telling you &gt;what I think and why.  If you disagree then show me why instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forbidding me effectively to have an opinion or apply any &gt;criteria at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply because some (or even most) disagree with me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I seem like I'm yelling, I apologize, that's not what I meant (even to imply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it). Can you show that something is really an absolute? To my satisfaction?
</em><br>
<p><p>All human knowledge is contextual.  But that doesn't mean that within a
<br>
context one can say nothing at all is certain. Human beings are
<br>
creatures with certain basic nature and characteristics. In the context
<br>
of human beings there are ways of treating them that are more or less
<br>
helpful.  I will only argue that libertarian values are more helpful
<br>
than most when construing the best ways of humans inter-relating.  I
<br>
don't need absolutes to make that case.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;Utterly outside the realm of this conversation.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Look around you. This is already happening (drug laws, police killings of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens, etc.) What happens, that is how much does the populace care? Not much,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually. I live in  a city where the police have killed young black men, refused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to answer questions about what happened, and the people in they city get mad at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the newspapers for reporting it. (I'm not making this up, I can find the letters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the editor.) People aren't always rational, or they don't always fit your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of rational. Still, you get dead, they go on plundering. If we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get enough people to accept that this is wrong, it stops. If not, your defensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force is meaningless.  (I am not arguing against defensive force, just trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make it unnecessary)
</em><br>
<p>Meaningless?  In the face of blatant human stupidity like that above it
<br>
is essential.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I didn't think ideas had power, would I be discussing this? No, all power is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not in the mob, but this is a democracy. People ought to be involved in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions which affect their lives, and we've got to meet them where they are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not demand they meet us on our terms. If we continue to do that, they're not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to show up at all.
</em><br>
<p>No real meaningful discussion can start without agreement on terms.  But
<br>
agreeing when the definitions themselves are contradictions just for the
<br>
sake of agreeing is fruitless.  Meet them where they are surely.  But
<br>
don't attempt to meet them in the make-believe land where they think
<br>
that they are. 
<br>
You can try doing even that if you are strong and patient enough.  But
<br>
when doing such work it is very important that you understand which of
<br>
their definitions make sense and which don't.
