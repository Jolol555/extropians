<p><em>&gt;I find the death penalty a difficult issue. Like you, Alex, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't trust the state with this kind of power. Mistakes *will* be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;made. On the other hand, some people should be killed for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crimes, or else kept in life-long solitary confinement where they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cannot harm again. I'm talking about multiple murderers/rapists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who exhibit sociopathic qualities. (Think of the character
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Billy--played by the brilliant Sam Rockwell, in The Green 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mile...) HOWEVER, looking ahead, so long as we have a death
</em><br>
<em>&gt;penalty (or for the days that I reluctantly support it), having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perps put into suspension for 50 years would allow those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;insist on their innocence to make a case. Of course, things never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work out exactly as intended. Once possible side-effect would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(if people started taking cryonics seriously) that more appeals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might be turned down, &quot;since you will have a second chance
</em><br>
anyway&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Even if the suspended perp is very definitely guilty (caught live
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on multiple video or independent and unimpeachable eyewitnesses)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or no one ever can cast doubt on their guilt, I *still* would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather suspend them than destroy them. I'm more comfortable with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being able to offer them the choice in the future when revival is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible and inexpensive: Now that we've brought you back, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have a choice: Either we execute you (since we can't let you run
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around freely with a destructive personality) or we can alter your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brain just enough to ensure that you don't want to initiate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aggression. Yes, more problems arise in that scenario, but at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least the person is given a chance. Since I don't believe in Evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People (but do think that certain actions and behaviors can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;called evil), I would rather offer someone redemption ever if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have done horrible things.
</em><br>
<p>The death penalty is a difficult issue.
<br>
<p>The biggest problem is that the victim is lost forever, as a result
<br>
I do not believe the killer should be allowed to live, nor be
<br>
suspended, I believe they should be treated equally with the
<br>
victim.
<br>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, I do believe that if this is ever
<br>
impleted correctly (it has not been yet). It will have a deterent
<br>
effect, not on psychotics, but on those who kill ex-spouses for
<br>
example.
<br>
<p>But I do not require a deterrent effect to believe it is just
<br>
punishment.
