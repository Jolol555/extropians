<p><em>&gt; Was this really called for?  The point is valid.  95% of those who are

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; unanimous feeling isn't the way to go forward - it's an arguement for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; status quo.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What do you mean it is an argument for the status quo?  The status quo
<br>
denies you have the right to defend yourself and that government and
<br>
others should never impede on that right.  The right to own and carry a
<br>
gun as and when you see fit is about as non status quo as you can get in
<br>
the current political climate.  
<br>
<p>If such things are not brought up and bashed out here, then where?  Are
<br>
we not here to talk about the things we think are important toward
<br>
creating a future conducive to our long life and wellbeing?
<br>
<p>It is not true that no minds change.  My own has changed and my ideas on
<br>
the subject (and quite a few others) have clarified quite a bit through
<br>
this and similar discussions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was the one who initially asked the question, &quot;why here?&quot; and I think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the answer is clear.  It will accomplish nothing but generating a lot of heat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and no light.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It has already accomplished more than that.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; And to those who cry &quot;freedom of speech&quot; I offer you this notion, given to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by my atheist/skeptic ex-roommate, which sums up why the freedom of speech is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not absolute.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (paraphrased)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Almost every Western culture has this scourge known as the Jehova's Witnesses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These people go door to door, peddling a meme that most people reject, and in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact it becomes something of a joke in many places - how will you best offend/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drive off these peddlers of religion from your door?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What renders these people an idle curiosity and less of a direct threat or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; major nuisance/irritant is that you have at any time the freedom to tell them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you're not interested, that you've already made up your mind, and to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; home and leave you alone.  Simply having the freedom to express yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not mean you have the right to force your expression upon others.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First Amendment  (to the US Constitution) does not give you the right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free time on all television networks so you can get your right to speak.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (end of point)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>How is talking about any X you don't like in a public forum &quot;forcing&quot;
<br>
anything on you?  Your point is utterly empty.  This forum is not your
<br>
front door.  It is a commons.  You are welcome to ignore conversations
<br>
you do not care for but you cannot tell those having them to simply go
<br>
away.  Er, you can tell them that but they can tell you to go to hell.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The point can be made that there was already a good place to take this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion (and a gentle nudge that it should be taken there) where those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who want to engage in it can speak to their heart's content.  It seems there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of people here who seem to be done with this discussion, and would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to see it go somewhere else to refine itself before it comes back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>But your wishes are no more sacrosanct than the wishes of others to have
<br>
this conversation.  Those who are done with this conversation will not
<br>
participate. If enough are done with it then it will peter out or move
<br>
on to fresher territory. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I've spoken my own peace in this subject, and it seems that my personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beleifs on it are very rare, to listen to people line up on either side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the issue - I'm a moderate.  Not wishy-washy, but not absolutist on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either side.  So don't tell me &quot;You're in favor of childkillers and drive-bys&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or &quot;you're just one step shy of the Gestapo and would rather that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not have a way to defend themselves&quot;.  Both sides are allowed to hate me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they'll find I don't care.  I'm not &quot;undecided&quot; - I refuse to play the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;My way or the highway&quot; game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think utterly polarizing statements are pointless in any discussion
<br>
myself. They are emotional digs rather than intelligent discussion. 
<br>
That doesn't leave me as a moderate on the issue, just unwilling to
<br>
argue it by such means.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now, if this kind of fervor could be stirred up over the colonization of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space - THAT is something I would bite for.  And it seems far more relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the long run than the question of today's choice in slugthrowers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Of course one can ask whether if you don't gain and keep the ability to
<br>
defend your own life and to be left free to make your own decisions then
<br>
you and other like minded folks will actually ever be free to build and
<br>
own the means to get to space and to own free and clear anything here or
<br>
off-planet.  Issues intersect and express common roots and themes.  What
<br>
I have gained a greater understanding of in this exchange on guns is
<br>
that the smelly old guns can't be ignored and put aside while still
<br>
gaining and keeping freedom to do and be what we wish.  I've heard that
<br>
before of course but it didn't seek in as far.
