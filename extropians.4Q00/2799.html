<br>
<p>I would make a couple comments on the &quot;bad trip&quot; phenomenon and the general
<br>
utility of psychedelics.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
1)  IMHO, the incidence of &quot;bad trips&quot; is widely overstated.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
2) The direction and content of any psychedelic experience, while no more
<br>
predictable than life itself, is still greatly sculptable by the
<br>
individual.  Set and setting are the two prime contributors to the nature
<br>
of a psychedelic experience.  Set = mood and expectation going into the
<br>
trip.  Setting = environment during the trip.  Taking LSD and going to a
<br>
wild party is not the same as taking LSD and meditating on a topic in a
<br>
tranquil environment.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
3) My personal experience is that psychedelics can be quite useful in
<br>
meta-programming, when properly used.  In addition, I think there is
<br>
something healthy about taking a drug that puts one in a slightly out of
<br>
control state.  Experiencing that state and coming through it builds a
<br>
certain amount of resiliance in the individual.  It is easy to be calm in
<br>
the face of many intense and unexpected experiences when one has
<br>
essentially practiced having intense and unexpected experiences.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
4) Finally, there are indeed cases of major psychosis or long-lasting
<br>
neurosis arising from use of psychedelics.  However these are also quite
<br>
rare, and generally seem to occur to those who had an obviously unstable
<br>
personality before the use of psychedelics.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem IMO with psychedelics as we have them today is their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unpredictability.  I had a good trip.  Lot's of folks don't.  And
<br>
from what
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, a bad trip on acid can be *really* bad.  Worse, I've
<br>
read that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long-lasting neuroses or psychoses have been triggered in a small
<br>
percentage
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of users.
