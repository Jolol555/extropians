<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;I can hear the howls from the greens now - what is the exhaust? N2O?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If a plane spewed out pure N20 or N02, it wouldn't be just the greens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that howled - that would be incredibly, well,  noxious ;-)  But I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thought N2 was the most stable form of nitrogen anyway ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It might be stable, but its not, apparently, the lowest energy compound of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nitrogen, since the Manhattan Project scientists were concerned at the time ofthe Alamagordo test that it would touch off the worldwide combustion of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earths atmosphere... It just takes a really high temperature to make it combust,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is why nukes don't do so, the energy output dissipates too quickly in open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; air to maintain the continued reaction, so at some distance from ground zero,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the air no longer combusts. I imagine that the jet we are talking about must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have one hell of a compression system to get N and O to sustainably combust.
</em><br>
<p>Now, I don't know if I heard this story correctly (I did hear it in a bar, but
<br>
they were some engineers from a really high level R&amp;D outfit...). The
<br>
alt.extropians newsgroup lists a post about a new project at the U of Washington
<br>
to develop an auto engine that runs off of compressed nitrogen. This would
<br>
obviously work in place of battery powered electric cars, thus alleviating the
<br>
environmental problems of lots of batteries being thrown out. There is a  volume
<br>
differential between liquid and gaseous nitrogen of 700, so its rather obvious
<br>
that a liquid nitrogen expansion motor would be an effective means of utilizing
<br>
this compact energy storage technique.
