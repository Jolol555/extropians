</em><br>
<p>Of course you can be persuaded.  But whether you are &quot;persuaded&quot; is
<br>
not determined internally, but externally.  I'm telling you this so as
<br>
to convince you, not so that you'll metaphysically Choose to believe
<br>
me, not because there's something you do which isn't deterministic or
<br>
random or some composition of the two.
<br>
<p>In fact, &quot;choice&quot; is really the process of *discovering* what you
<br>
want.  You think very hard about this when it isn't very obvious what
<br>
you want, and you think about it very little when it is obvious what
<br>
you want.  But what you want is determined externally.  So you act
<br>
following the orders of these desires, which you don't Choose.
<br>
Sometimes you don't even know what your desires are.  But you never
<br>
Choose them.
<br>
<p>As Steve pointed out, sometimes you can choose to change your desires
<br>
(e.g. via hypnosis).  But if you do so voluntarily, you do so because
<br>
you FOUND that you desire to change your desires.  So you changed your
<br>
desires under the orders of other desires, which you did not select.
<br>
<p>All of your behavior is governed by externally determined desires.
<br>
Hopefully, you desire to believe this, in which case, you do;
<br>
otherwise, you don't.
