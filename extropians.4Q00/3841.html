<em>&gt; &gt;I could do some research, but off the top of my head there was a case

<em>&gt; &gt;across the river in White River Junction, VT just a couple months ago
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;where a black police officer was called n_____ by a drunk woman he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;arrested for D&amp;D. At the station he also pressed charges for a hate

<em>&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't being verbally insulting to a

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No, you can't be charged with anything for speaking your mind to a
<br>
police officer, so long as you did not threaten him. Only speech which
<br>
threatens can be considered verbal assault, as in &quot;I'm gonna lynch you,
<br>
n____&quot;. 
<br>
<p>However, in my experience vermont cops do tend to go overboard. A few
<br>
years ago a Vermont State Trooper was eating breakfast at Denny's in
<br>
West Lebanon, New Hampshire, and the cook put tobasco sauce in his
<br>
scrambled eggs. The cop arrested him and charged him with assault and
<br>
battery. The guy got off claiming orders got mixed up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The woman insisted she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;never used such language when sober and did not conciously intend to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that epithet. Given that drugs like alcohol act to suppress the ego and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;allow the id more liberties (i.e. reduces inhibitions) this is as close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to a thought crime as I think it is possible to go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please please please don't in any remotely conceivable way imply that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people should have less responsibility for their actions after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they've *voluntarily* surrendered their rationality to mind-altering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The increasingly staunch Libertarian in me wants to be allowed to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with my own body whatever I choose.  I'll never be given that freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if others assume that I won't expect to be held responsible if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abuse that freedom.
</em><br>
<p>While you have a point here, there is still a distinct difference in
<br>
that the conduct was not willful, not something they would normally do.
<br>
While intentionally running someone down with your car while sober will
<br>
get you murder charges, doing so unintentionally while drunk will get
<br>
you negligent homicide or manslaughter charges.
<br>
<p>How many of us have said things, even sober, we did not intend, or did
<br>
not intend maliciously. Possibly to an ex spouse, sibling, parent, etc.
<br>
in the heat of the moment? Should you get 6 months in prison and a $5000
<br>
fine for each instance? I don't think so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Its tantamount to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;putting a right wing republican under the influence of sodium pentathol
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and asking them if they'd like to off Pres. Clinton if given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;opportunity, then charging them with violation of federal law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Forcibly taking away someone's rationality and then punishing them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for breaking the law under that coercion is light years away from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;tantamount&quot; to the situation you described previously.
</em><br>
<p>The taking away rationality is not the point. Just as any speech made
<br>
before one's Miranda Rights have been read is not admissible as
<br>
confession evidence, one's extemporaneous everyday speech should not
<br>
have to be guarded like one lives in a police state. If there are laws
<br>
that create such an atmosphere, guess what? You live in a police state.
