<em>&gt; gut, cook

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What does that have to do with the Green Party platform?  Absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing.
</em><br>
<p>It would be a nicely eye opening experience for the majority of alleged Greens,
<br>
who are little but disillusioned boyscouts and girlscouts who still think
<br>
Disney's Bambi is a true reflection of real nature, and still think that Marx
<br>
has any relevance whatsoever to today's world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's see... the Greens support equal redistribution of wealth, an increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in localization and community self-reliance, fighting for equal civil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights, better regulated international trade, the development of clean and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sustainable sources of energy, the promotion of mass transit and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighborhoods constructed for pedestrians instead of cars, a woman's right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to reproductive choice, the promotion of small scale organic agriculture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over industrialized, chemical agriculture, Native American sovereignty, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waste reduction programs.
</em><br>
<p>- equal distribution of wealth: i.e. confiscation of property by government
<br>
gunpower.
<br>
- localization and community self-reliance: communities can do whatever they
<br>
want so long as it complies with the Great Green Way.
<br>
- fighting for equal civil rights: i.e. 'OUR' minorities and special interest
<br>
groups (even women, who are a majority) get preferences in everything, and evil
<br>
while males have to pay for it all.
<br>
- the development of clean and sustainable sources of energy: except for solar
<br>
power satellites in orbit (where they would be most effective), hydropower
<br>
(cause its bad for the fishies), woodpower (cause it hurts the holy forest trees
<br>
and cute and fuzzy animals), windpower (when they are in sight of the homes of
<br>
our High Ranking Holy Green Warriors, or when there is the remotest chance a
<br>
cute and fuzzy bird will get caught in one), and nuclear power (fission, we
<br>
don't want any breeder reactors that would eliminate the waste problem, and
<br>
fusion is just encouraging those damn technologists).
<br>
- promotion of mass transit: which funnels taxpayer money into our Union allies
<br>
pockets and construction companies that donate to our Party coffers, never mind
<br>
that mass transit systems only work with communities above a given population
<br>
density, and that the average subway and/or rail system costs enough to provide
<br>
each new mass transit rider a new BMW every other year for 40 years.
<br>
- a woman's right to reproductive choice: i.e. a) heterosexual sex is rape b) a
<br>
man has choice for only 4-5 seconds during intercourse, but a woman has a choice
<br>
to kill a human being for 9 months, and c) a man has no right to demand either a
<br>
woman end a pregnancy or absolve the male of future financial responsibility.
<br>
Ergo: Equal protection under the law is dead.
<br>
- promotion of organic agriculture: We want to reduce productivity in
<br>
agriculture so the evil imperialist American phallocracy can no longer feed the
<br>
poor masses in the 3rd world who truly want a socialist revolution, only they
<br>
don't know it yet.
<br>
- waste reduction: I don't want a dump built in my back yard, and she doesn't
<br>
want one in her back yard, so instead of two dumps, we are going to cut our
<br>
trash per capita by half, and build only one dump, in her back yard, at the
<br>
point of a government gun, just so long as it isn't in my back yard.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, the future that I think most Greens envision is not one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wilderness survivalism, but one of a technological ecotopia reminiscent of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Earth seen on Star Trek... in other words, a progressive, holistic view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which we begin to focus on what is really important in life, instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what corporations tell us, and where advanced technology intermingles with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clean, healthy planetary ecosystem.
