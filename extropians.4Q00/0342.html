<em>&gt; Incidentally think the CR life extension method works

<p>My trial for a few months, about four years ago, with CR (with supplements
<br>
for full nutrition), actually did not reduce my energy levels.  I felt more
<br>
peppy than when I overeat.  (I admit, I don't overeat all that often, but
<br>
the general feeling I get when I eat a lot is that I'm tired.)
<br>
<p>What are other people's experience on CR?
<br>
<p>My current diet is below average -- below 2K calories per diem -- but above
<br>
CR.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
