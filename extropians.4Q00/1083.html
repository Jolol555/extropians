<br>
<p><p>Sinusitis caused in some by cystic fibrosis gene
<br>
<p>Approximately 14% of Americans suffer from sinusitis, an inflammation of
<br>
the mucous membranes of the sinuses frequently found in allergy sufferers.
<br>
Sinusitis is a common complaint, leading to 11.6 million physician's
<br>
office visits in 1991 alone, and in some cases causing sufferers to seek
<br>
out surgical intervention. The condition is poorly understood. The October
<br>
11 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association revealed that
<br>
in some individuals, the genetic mutations that cause the disease cystic
<br>
fibrosis causes chronic sinusitis in others. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an
<br>
inherited disease characterized by an alteration in the lungs' mucous
<br>
membranes, leading to an overproduction of thick, sticky mucous. The
<br>
disease has been found to be caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis
<br>
transmembrane regulator gene, or CFTR, which regulates the cell membrane's
<br>
flow of water and salt. Because CF patients suffer from chronic sinusitis,
<br>
researchers at Johns Hopkins sought to determine if sinusitis patients
<br>
without CF could have similar CTFR mutations.
<br>
<p>The study, partly funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Kidney
<br>
Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes for Health, examined the DNA
<br>
of 147 sinusitis patients who did not have CF, and found the cystic
<br>
fibrosis mutation in ten of them, a rate five times that of the rest of
<br>
the population.
<br>
<p>Marshall Plaut, MD of the NIAID commented, &quot;The study is among the first
<br>
to investigate the genetic basis of chronic sinusitis, a common and
<br>
troublesome disorder. It provides new insights into the cause of the
<br>
disease in some people and points to new strategies for diagnosis and
<br>
treatment. It represents a new and important research direction.&quot;
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Allergies
<br>
<p>Allergies are abnormal immune reactions to specific agents known as
<br>
antigens or allergens. Examples of common allergens are foods, drugs,
<br>
pollens, dust mites, mold spore, animal danders, feathers, and insect
<br>
venoms, as well as other substances which nonallergic people find
<br>
relatively nondangerous with usual exposure.
<br>
<p>Allergies may also develop when an otherwise innocent substance has
<br>
significant contact with an already inflamed surface (sensitization), such
<br>
as from a viral infection or exposure to irritants, and becomes involved
<br>
in the immune response. Thereafter, repeat exposure to such a substance
<br>
may evoke an allergic response with the release of a histamine and a
<br>
variety of proinflammatory substances, including enzymes, leukotrienes,
<br>
and interleukins, and the creation of damaging free radicals. The
<br>
multiplicity of these proinflammatory substances explains why single
<br>
medications such as antihistamines often fail to completely control
<br>
symptoms.
<br>
<p>The number of supplements required to suppress allergy symptoms can appear
<br>
daunting, but the health benefits of consuming these nutrients include
<br>
reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia,
<br>
osteoporosis, arthritis, and a host of degenerative diseases associated
<br>
with normal aging. Therefore, while the objective of the allergy patient
<br>
is immediate relief, the use of nutritional supplements can provide a
<br>
long-term solution in treating the underlying cause of the chronic allergy
<br>
problem and helping to maintain an optimal state of health.
<br>
<p>One or more of the following nutritional supplements should be tried by
<br>
the allergy sufferer for at least 2 months:
<br>
1. Life Extension Mix, 3 tablets, 3 times a day.
<br>
2. GLA from borage oil, 1500 mg a day, along with at least 3000 mg a day
<br>
of the omega-3 fatty acids from fish, flax, or perilla oils. (Six to
<br>
twelve capsules a day of Udo's Choice multi-oil blend may also be used.)
<br>
3. CoQ10 with tocotrienols, 30 mg, 3 times a day.
<br>
4. Vitamin C, 3000 to 9000 mg a day (Life Extension Mix provides about
<br>
2500 mg of vitamin C).
<br>
5. Magnesium, 500 to 1500 mg a day, taken with 900 to 1000 mg of calcium.
<br>
6. DHEA, 25 mg, twice a day (refer to DHEA Replacement Therapy protocol
<br>
for safety precautions).
<br>
7. NAC, 600 mg a day, in addition to the 600 mg already contained in Life
<br>
Extension Mix.
<br>
8. Life Flora, 1 capsule 3 times a day for a week, then reduce dose to 1
<br>
capsule a day thereafter. Supplementation with 5000 mg of FOS powder will
<br>
help protect the beneficial bacterial contained in Life Flora in your gut.
<br>
9. Grape seed-skin extract, 100 mg, 3 times a day.
<br>
10. Nettle leaf extract, 750 mg a day.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
N-acetyl cysteine
<br>
<p>N-acetyl-cysteine, a sulfur containing free form amino acid, is a
<br>
precursor for glutathione in the body and has been used to boost
<br>
glutathione levels in cells. N-acetyl-cysteine is a more stable and
<br>
effective antioxidant than L-cysteine, being the acetylated form of
<br>
cysteine which provides for better absorption. It is an antioxidant that
<br>
has been used to combat viruses, as a liver protectant and to break up
<br>
pulmonary and bronchial mucus.

<br>
<p>Vitamin C Capsules
<br>
<p>Each hard gelatin capsule contains 1000 mg of pure crystalline ascorbic
<br>
acid, providing 1,666% of the US RDA. Use an antacid with this form of
<br>
Vitamin C if you have an ulcer. Vitamin C is an important antioxidant,
<br>
helpful in lowering cholesterol and preventing heart disease, improving
<br>
immune function, maintaining healthy skin and blood vessels, accelerating
<br>
healing, and reducing allergic reactions.

<p><p>BOOK:  The Power to Destroy
<br>
By Senator William V Roth, Jr and William H Nixon
<br>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service has powers unrivaled by any agency of our
<br>
federal government, powers that can irrevocably affect the lives of more
<br>
than 200 million American taxpayers. Since its founding, the agency's use-
<br>
-and abuse--of these powers has spawned controversy and frequent calls for
<br>
reform. But for years, the IRS had rebuffed these efforts, openly
<br>
resisting all attempts to alter the agency's structure or policies and
<br>
engaging in acts that have intimidated those who sought change.
<br>
<p>In 1997 William Roth spearheaded the most extensive tax collection reform
<br>
effort in modern history. He initiated an investigation into the IRS and
<br>
chaired congressional hearings that uncovered horrifying stories of abuses
<br>
against taxpayers that shocked the nation. The legislation that
<br>
resulted--the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring Act, which passed the
<br>
Senate unanimously in May 1998--has ushered in what The New York Times
<br>
called &quot;the most sweeping changes in decades to an agency whose very
<br>
function has long made it the most reviled in government.&quot;
<br>
<p>Part expose' of a government agency gone grievously wrong, part history of
<br>
a radical and unprecedented reform effort, and part empowering handbook
<br>
for understanding the new tax laws, The Power to Destroy is a provocative
<br>
book every taxpaying America needs to read.
