</em><br>
<p>Harmful in what sense?  Making people choose actions that are less adaptive
<br>
means making them choose actions that lead to fewer descendants.  The paper
<br>
is about what actions better satisfy the preferences of the people involved,
<br>
whether that leads to more or fewer descendants.

<p><em>&gt;What if someone wrote a paper proposing to change prices.  Let's lower

</em><br>
<p>As economists usually define social welfare, this would not improve social
<br>
welfare.  Even if a few consumers gain, many more consumers would lose, as
<br>
would producers.  All these gains and losses are from the point of view
<br>
of the preferences of the people involved.
