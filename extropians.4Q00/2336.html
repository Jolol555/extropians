<p>That &quot;stunningly limited menu of options&quot; as you nicely put it, surely adds 
<br>
to my point. Democratic systems (currently) are not well geared to offering 
<br>
multiple options. One way of possibly improving on this might be Kosko's 
<br>
fuzzy tax form, though I can see problems with implementing it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;usually find that representations by parliamentarians from the non-ruling
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Point taken. Yet these avenues of influence, while allowing in more voices, 
<br>
may actually move the final decision (in the form of legislation) *further* 
<br>
away from the &quot;will of the people&quot;. As you said, there's no need to get 
<br>
into Politics 101. We're surely all familiar with the problem arising from 
<br>
the concentrated incentives of pressure groups to impose costs on others 
<br>
where those costs are so diffused as not to be worth organizing against by 
<br>
the much larger number of losers.
<br>
<p>Come to think of it, they *don't* generally teach that in Politics 101, but 
<br>
they should. A good dose of Frederic Bastiat's classic essay Ce qu'on voit 
<br>
et ce qu'on ne voit pas (or Henry Hazlitt's extended version in Economics 
<br>
in One Lesson  would help clarify many discussions on political economy.
