Hi Dan,
<br>
<p>The people I know in the pro-space movement who are the leaders 
<br>
and movers and shakers - the ones who are going to get us into 
<br>
space - are optimists for sure.  (Robert Zubrin of the Mars Society 
<br>
<a href="http://www.marssociety.org">http://www.marssociety.org</a>, or Rick Tumlinson of the Space Frontier 
<br>
Foundation <a href="http://space-frontier.org">http://space-frontier.org</a>, or Peter Diamandis of the 
<br>
X-Prize Foundation <a href="http://www.xprize.org">http://www.xprize.org</a>, or Henry Vanderbilt of the 
<br>
Space Access Society <a href="http://www.space-access.org">http://www.space-access.org</a>, etc, etc). However, 
<br>
they are not practical people by any stretch of the imagination. 
<br>
They are quite dynamic indeed.
<br>
<p>Really, though, I haven't been around for all of the discussions that
<br>
went on in the process of updating the principles, so this is just my
<br>
two cents.  I would never expect any principles to be changed back, and
<br>
backtracking like that seems to go against what extropianism stands
<br>
for anyway.  I was just venting.  And I am very happy to be in 
<br>
touch with such a dynamic (I'm scared to use that word now) group of
<br>
people again.
<br>
<p>BTW, we don't KNOW we're getting into space.  We are flying in circles 
<br>
and important missions are being cancelled.  NASA's gigantic &quot;humans
<br>
in space&quot; budget has been spent on the shuttle, then the ISS (all 
<br>
well and good, but not leaving Earth's gravity well) and is now going 
<br>
to be spent on a 4.5 billion dollar thing called the Space Launch 
<br>
Initiative which is not as good as it sounds, and again, all within
<br>
the great gravity well.  We do have a sliver of a chance to encourage
<br>
our new president to initiate a humans to Mars program.  Please see
<br>
<a href="http://www.marchforspace.com">http://www.marchforspace.com</a> and add your &quot;reason for going into space&quot;.
<br>
That will help the cause.  I have not announced this page to the world
<br>
yet.  Just started it up and am waiting to get more &quot;reasons&quot; first.

<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; Speaking as one of the people who was strongly in favor of calling it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Practical Optimism,&quot; I take issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Optimism is optimism.  The question is only whether you'll have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimism in a constructive way or in a destructive way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I told people that extropy is about &quot;dynamic optimism,&quot; they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't hear the word &quot;dynamic.&quot;  They didn't see that we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prepared to shift strategies in order to move forward.  All they saw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was the &quot;optimism;&quot; calling it &quot;dynamic&quot; was merely there for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emphasis, as far as they were concerned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For all the connotations are worth, being &quot;dynamically optimistic&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't sound significantly different from being &quot;extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimistic.&quot;  But there's more to be said about the principle than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, as you know.  I think &quot;Practical Optimism&quot; communicates the mood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correctly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We're still headed for space; we're still aiming for boundless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expansion, and we still think that we'll get there.  But now people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that we're not just HOPING to get into space; we think we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *going* to get there, by doing what we have to do to bring about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress.  We're *smart* optimists, which is what &quot;dynamic optimism&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failed to communicate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for Perpetual Progress replacing Boundless Expansion... who cares
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about &quot;bigger&quot;?  What we want is to get *better*.  Boundless Expansion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connotes that bigger is better, a half-baked philosophical principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that nobody here endorsed.  I worry that you're right that Perpetual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Progress doesn't sound as good as Boundless Expansion, though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for Spontaneous Order...  did Spontaneous Order mean something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different for you than Open Society, Self Direction and Rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thinking?  Something else?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -----------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To play the devil's advocate, there IS something else I meant by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spontaneous Order isn't captured in the current list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as the philosophy of mind goes, I'm a functionalist.  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that things that act like brains are conscious.  Some people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occasionally try to run a certain kind of reductio ad absurdum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument on functionalists, arguing: &quot;What if a whole group of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got together and started acting like individual neurons, and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuron-like activity made them act just like a brain?  Would THAT make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their organization conscious?&quot;  I answer yes.  I think this happens to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be one of the deeply interesting facts about our world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Autocatalysis is one of the things intelligence does, IMO.  It's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary but insufficient condition for being smart.  Things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve Spontaneous Order are important in their own right, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have one of those special characteristics that smart things have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not coincidentally, almost everything we take to be beautiful, or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting, is Spontaneously Ordered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not saying that all Spontaneously Ordered systems should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; granted rights or anything like that... I'm just saying that such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems are inherently interesting, and important.  That's something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the current principles don't take into account.  Maybe they shouldn't,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the same reason we shouldn't call it &quot;dynamic optimism.&quot;  But *I*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really like Spontaneous Order.  I think it's cool.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's all.  :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
