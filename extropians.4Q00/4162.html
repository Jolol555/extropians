<em>&gt; Personally I think civilisations do not converge in the long run,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despite living under the same ultimate laws of physics - cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences may make them branch in completely different directions.
</em><br>
<p>In further support of your comments, I'd add that the &quot;us versus them&quot;
<br>
paradigm is probably congenital in humans, and it explains why the
<br>
territorial imperative produces irrational scenarios such as Mutually
<br>
Assured Destruction. The second Enlightenment mentioned by Edelman does not
<br>
directly address the convergence of civilizations, focusing instead on the
<br>
convergence of the sciences, as outlined by Wilson's _Consilience_.
<br>
<p>One civilization may decide to pretend that it has SI, in order to advance
<br>
its non-SI agenda. This would be a foolish mistake, since real SI would
<br>
overwhelm such dishonesty by the clever maneuver of out-smarting it. Nothing
<br>
particularly difficult to understand there.
<br>
<p>Another civilization may consist largely of individuals who are frightened
<br>
of SI and the second Enlightenment that it engenders. This is probably the
<br>
most dangerous type of society, and one that deserves the attention of our
<br>
collective intelligence to deal with its propaganda and its irrationality.
<br>
So far, the best way of preventing luddite fundamentalist populations from
<br>
dominating the world has been to &quot;walk softly and carry a big stick.&quot; I
<br>
think SI (real SI, not a bogus front for advancing an agenda) will be the
<br>
biggest stick the second Enlightenment can brandish.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,

I think I'd add &quot;free will&quot; to the list of &quot;consciousness&quot; &quot;phlogiston&quot;
<br>
&quot;vitalism&quot; and &quot;mind&quot; as examples of useless hypotheses.
<br>
-------------------------
<br>
&quot;If you go back a hundred years,&quot; he explains, &quot;one of the biggest
<br>
scientific questions was 'what is life?' And one of the most prominent
<br>
theories had to do with vitalism--some substance, some thing that is
<br>
transmitted from cell to cell, animal to animal, that is the essence of
<br>
life. Well, you don't hear anybody talking about vitalism anymore. We've
<br>
come far enough to see all the mechanics--we've seen how DNA works, we've
<br>
seen all the pieces of the cell, and we don't have need for a hypothesis
<br>
like vitalism.&quot; So it will go, Sejnowski suspects, with consciousness.
<br>
(Phlogiston, incidentally, refers to a theoretical substance that people
<br>
once sought in combustible material, thinking it made up the &quot;substance&quot; of
<br>
fire.)
