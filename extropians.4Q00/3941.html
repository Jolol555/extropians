Ah, well, to extend the beer analogy, I'm sure there will be socialists
<br>
who will say that society only rents you the atoms that make up your
<br>
food, totally ignoring the fact that food atoms wind up as YOU, which
<br>
would therefore mean they are, again, supporting slavery of the
<br>
individual to society, as Proudhon said 155 years ago.
