<em>&gt;Stock markets implicitly forecast out to infinity.  That is, they estimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a weighted average of future profits, weighted by risk-rated interest rates.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;On most of the questions that investors consider important, few people 
<br>
attempt to forecast more than 5 years ahead, and once an investor sees
<br>
slightly further ahead than most, there is little incentive to see further.
<br>
So the market basically gives up on forecasting answers to those questions
<br>
out to infinity.
<br>
&nbsp;But this is largely because markets focus attention on questions which are
<br>
hard but not impossible to answer, such as comparing the competence of
<br>
groups of people who have been selected for high competence.
<br>
&nbsp;The are many questions on which markets provide clear and relatively reliable
<br>
longer term forecasts, such as whether Cisco's revenues will grow faster than
<br>
U.S. Steel's revenues between 2005 and 2010. Democratic processes prefer to
<br>
obfuscate answers to many of these questions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But I think this is as it should be.  The benefits of citizens being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ridiculously rich just a year sooner are so enormous that it should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get a very large weight.  Of course it wouldn't be worth, say, losing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;half the population to a sudden death, but my proposed measure gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that right too I think.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I wish I could share your confidence that your measure properly weights
<br>
the consequences of disaster. I suspect it will take a lot of trial and
<br>
error before any measure deserves confidence.
