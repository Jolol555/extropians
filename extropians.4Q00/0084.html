<em>&gt; &gt; Lets say your policy with your PPL states 'no death penalty for murder'. Mine

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; execution, although they are obligated to determine if you actually initiated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; force against me unprovoked, or were defending yourself against my initiation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or whether your actions were the result of accident or negligence. They thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; provide your defense in arbitration with prosecutors from my PPL. Arbitrators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would be independent of both parties. Prosecution would pay for the trial,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; subject to recovery from the convicted if a conviction results.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are several problems here.  Like, why my PPL should automatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drop me just because I am accused of a crime but not yet convicted.
</em><br>
<p>Did you read anything I wrote? Did I not say &quot;they are obligated to determine if you
<br>
actually initiated force against me unprovoked, or were defending yourself against my
<br>
initiation, or whether your actions were the result of accident or negligence&quot;? Your
<br>
PPL would provide your defense in arbitration, to determine your guilt or innocence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convicted I should be governed by the rules of my PPL, not yours.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Otherwise my PPL contract is really, &quot;we won't execute you for murder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but we will disown you once we're sure you did it.&quot;  This is not a PPL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with any real closure.
</em><br>
<p>You don't get to choose what punishment you could potentially get. If such were
<br>
available, then criminals could buy policies of total immunity from prosecution, and
<br>
do what they wanted. Nobody else would permit such a PPL policy to exist. Your PPL
<br>
policy dictates what punishments you want to see for crimes against YOU, not commited
<br>
by you. Thats why PPL providers are called PPAs, its called Private Protection Agency,
<br>
not Private Accomplice Agency. No PPL would want to be charged as an accomplice with a
<br>
criminal, so any PPL policy would dictate breach of contract if the individual is
<br>
found to be guilty of comitting a crime after a duly ajudicated arbitration trial.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, who determines the rules of evidence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; courtroom proceedings?  Your PPL? Mine? Neither? Both?  How does this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work?  What sets of rules or organization govern the arbitrators?
</em><br>
<p>Common Law is an excellent basis for such a system. It developed in such a way that it
<br>
lends itself quite nicely to operating on a private basis, independent of government
<br>
oversight or control. It and the UCC are commonly used in arbitration already in the
<br>
insurance industry as well as in other existing PPL systems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Private law is nothing new. 99% of legal action between the USPS and the postal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unions are in fact done on a private basis with arbitrators already. According
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to my postal union friends, it costs about 1/4 as much as going the public court
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; route, they do have a body of precedent of past arbitration to work from (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; designed a judgement search database for one of the regional union arbitration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reps), and so long as the union does its job to take care of its members, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system works quite well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Within some limits determined by the overall legal system. Private law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (like the way IRS cases used to be run) is certainly not an unmitigated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blessing.
</em><br>
<p>The IRS tax courts are not privately produced law, they are a pirate
<br>
extraconstitutional synidcate. Little more than a legalized mob, and since the IRS is
<br>
a government agency, and they run the tax courts (the tax courts are not independent
<br>
or part of the Judicial branch of the government, they are part of the executive
<br>
branch of government).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Arguing from analogy does nothing to address the point raised.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Predictability of a reasonable degree is quite relevant if you want a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; generally sane and peaceful society where conflicts do not become armed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; conflicts too often.  Calling names is even weaker than using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; inapplicable analogies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, tell me this: Why do you think centralized control is so godawful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; important? It should be pretty emminently accepted by now that centralizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; control of anything tends to cause more abuse and violation of trust than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decentralization. My analogy holds, because there is little difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; socialized law, socialized medicine, socialized employment, or socialized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anything. You ought to be smart enough to see that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, who said I do think it is so important (godawful or otherwise)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think overarching agreements that covered all parties are very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important to peaceful and dependable cooperative actions and recourse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when agreements are not met.  Generally, interaction and trade is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simplified between parties having in common a set of governing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles and remedies.  If there are more autonomous groups involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then negotiations between members of those groups must gross a divide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where there are relatively few such commonalities.  It tends towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making interaction between individuals of two differently governed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (contracted law and enforcement) parties more complex somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analagously to internationa versus domestic law.
</em><br>
<p>There are plenty of privately administered governing prinicples or remedies. The
<br>
Uniform Building Code, Electrical Code, Machanical Code, as well as the Uniform
<br>
Commercial Code are all examples of this, and the government has absolutely nothing to
<br>
do with creating them. These, and hundreds of other examples are conveniently ignored,
<br>
and their histories of peaceful administration, with no police actions, no wars, and
<br>
no repression, are also conveniently ignored by those who pooh pooh concepts of
<br>
libertarian governance. We already know that these things work, its just that there
<br>
are still many areas of governance where the control freaks and mind manipulators
<br>
still control things, and continually propagandize bullshit reasons why they should
<br>
remain in charge, typically along the lines that they know better than the people what
<br>
is good for them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are to be smart enough to stop telling me that I ought to be smart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to think like you about this matter.  Why are you using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bullying/shaming type techniques?
