I want to thank Harvey Newstrom for clarifying Al Gore's role in the
<br>
creation of the internet.  I had heard that he had &quot;invented&quot; it, and had
<br>
wondered quite skeptically at this overblown attribution.  Now I find that
<br>
he in fact did have a substantial role.  That, combined with his interest
<br>
in nanotech as evidenced by his interview of Drexler--Senate committee
<br>
thing, as I recall--tends to confirm the impression I had of him as a
<br>
forward-thinking tech-savvy kind of guy.  
<br>
<p>So in place of tech-savvy, we get tech's ass.  (I plead guilty to a
<br>
waste-of-bandwidth offense, and throw myself on the mercy of the court.)
<br>
<p>In the 1940's movie, &quot;Key Largo,&quot; Edward G. Robinson, playing the gangster,
<br>
Johnny Rocco,
<br>
makes an interesting speech to Bogey (as the embittered ex-Army officer):
<br>
&quot;Let me tell you about Florida politicians. I make them. I make them outta
<br>
whole cloth-just like a tailor makes a suit. I get their name in the
<br>
newspaper, I get them some publicity and get them on the ballot.  Then after
<br>
the election we count the votes, and if they don't turn out right, we
<br>
re-count them and re-count them again until they do.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
