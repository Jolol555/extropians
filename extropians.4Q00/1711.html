<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; No, actually the whole idea is that nanotech/AI/superintelligence scenario is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; hopefully alien enough to eliminate even the need for self-defensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking.  My own philosophy is that the future is so distant - not just in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; terms of the environment, but in terms of who we will be - that the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; course is to try and be the most intense human you can be, here and now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; without moping too much over how much better you would be if you didn't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to be human.  Arguably, firearms - and to an even greater extent, martial arts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; - are a part of that.  The question, as always, is time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Cheerio. The one rhetorical card I see you palming in the above is &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whole idea&quot; s/b &quot;my [Eliezer's] whole idea&quot;. :) You're still doing 'way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better than most politicians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't get that.  And what's s/b?
</em><br>
<p>You used the phrase &quot;the whole idea&quot;; I was quibbling and suggesting you
<br>
might better have said &quot;*my* whole idea&quot; to clearly mark that it's your
<br>
approach, not The Only Way To Think. Not that you actually said that,
<br>
but the use of the definite article is a standard technique of sneaking
<br>
a desired assumption's nose into the tent as a goes-without-saying. I
<br>
wouldn't be surprised if the pre-Socratics did it. Does ancient Greek
<br>
have articles, or just single-dual-plural? I know they wrestled and
<br>
agonized over the &quot;is&quot; puzzles (is of identity ?= is of possesses a
<br>
property ?= is of exists)....
<br>
<p>&quot;s/b&quot; is &quot;should be&quot;, and I think it's an ugly shortcut but it still
<br>
slips in sometimes.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It can also be read as &quot;I have a handle on a piece of what the Universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can dish out, insofar as I am able.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have that right now, and while I may know which end of a safety is up and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what a roundhouse kick is, the truth is that I don't know how to shoot and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't taken any martial-arts training since age nine or so.  That particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got-a-grip feeling is the result of self-awareness, knowing how your mind will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; react even if you run across something you can't handle.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely. I was speaking of competence at arms as one stimulus for
<br>
that experience, not holding it up as the only way of achieving same.
<br>
&quot;It's all good&quot;--competence at anything(s) and a modicum of self
<br>
reflection, I mean.
<br>
<p>Mike
