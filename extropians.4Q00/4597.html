How new millennium is failing to live up to expectations
<br>
<a href="http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4109543,00.html">http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4109543,00.html</a>
<br>
By the year 2001, we confidently expected to see computers doing our
<br>
housework, trains as fast as bullets, a cure for the common cold and
<br>
holidays on Venus.
<br>
Instead we have enslavement to keyboards, Railtrack and multinational
<br>
companies plotting to patent our genes - and we are still sniffling. The
<br>
future has failed us and we feel it keenly, said an NOP poll published
<br>
yesterday.
<br>
-------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>I didn't participate in this survey, but I can tell you that when I was 15
<br>
years old, I fully expected to die in combat someday on some muddy Asian
<br>
soil. Things have turned out altogether differently than I had expected,
<br>
and I may owe my life to the atom bomb. Without nuclear weapons, I
<br>
probably would have been drafted and sent off to war, there to die with
<br>
millions of others. The bomb made the war cold. Thanks to all the
<br>
scientists who continue to make total war unthinkable by making possible
<br>
weapons of mass destruction.
<br>
<p>Happy Newtonmas,
<br>
