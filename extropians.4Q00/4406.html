<em>&gt;That's right, I was there

<p><em>&gt;I've been on the Internet since administrators used

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;remember spending alot

</em><br>
<p>Puh-lease....
<br>
<p>I had a top-secret clearance and was building Arpanet before you knew 
<br>
what a network was.  I invented network technology and helped debug 
<br>
protocols before the Internet converted to TCP/IP.  I debuged network 
<br>
links before we had a connection to Europe.  I was an admin years 
<br>
before ISPs like yours (The Well) were allowed on the Internet.  I 
<br>
was probably one of those admins who asked you users to stay out of 
<br>
my way.
<br>
<p>Your talk of the &quot;early days&quot; is about two decades too late to impress me.
