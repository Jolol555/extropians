&quot;<a href="mailto:Spudboy100@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Gematria,%20Cryptology,%20and%20Extropic%20Mysticism&In-Reply-To=&lt;200011171428.eAHES0Y29262@panix1.panix.com&gt;">Spudboy100@aol.com</a>&quot; apparently wrote, about Carl Sagan:
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<em>&gt; He was brilliant as a inspirer and sharer of scientific knowledege. He was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also big time into the Ganja and this at age 55-60!  ...
</em><br>
<p>So what?  I hope that members of this list are smart enough not to buy
<br>
the ridiculous lies of entities like the U.S. drug warriors and others
<br>
for whom mere marijuana consumption is some kind of moral taint.
<br>
Especially given that many on this list openly enjoy the far more
<br>
dangerous drug alcohol for conviviality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... He was a big time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schmuckeroo when it came time to face down the Soviets, when they wished to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Glom West Asia and Western Europe--and glom it they would have, had not the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; West and Old Man Reagan showed them a fist, and the will to use it. Carl 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sagan  was chicken ala Carl on the money for SDI, and basically viewed the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world so pessimistically, that surrender was better then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annihilation ...
</em><br>
<p>So you're basically saying he wasn't macho enough for you?  Please
<br>
spare me.
<br>
<p>I for one am no enthusiast of an imperial US power and support the
<br>
libertarian position of ending the income tax.  It's kind of hard to
<br>
do that while trying to establish imperial peace around the globe.  I
<br>
think a US that looks after the bare minimum of its self defense is
<br>
ultimately in the world's best interest, and immediately in its own
<br>
national interest, and I have no enthusiasm for my government's
<br>
playing world's policeman.  While this may not be official list
<br>
politics anymore, there are many similarly minded people here, still,
<br>
I hope.  I, too, would have counselled caution and parsimony in
<br>
experimental military expenditures, and allow me to ask this: what did
<br>
the SDI money buy us?  When did the benchmark for sensible policy on
<br>
science and technology become &quot;how tough are you?&quot; as opposed to
<br>
showing results?  I'd rather be right than tough every time.
