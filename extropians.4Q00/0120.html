I may not be being fair to you, but after reading your absolving of Albert 
<br>
Speer, yes I even read his book; I consider that since you don't accept the 
<br>
accounts of the historians and journalists that I provided, we have nothing 
<br>
to talk about, because we don't seem to have a convergent view of what really 
<br>
happended. I know that the socialists committed mass murder by the tens of 
<br>
millions-mostly their own people, On the other hand you do what evangelical 
<br>
protestant do which, when confronted by their own historical accounts by, for 
<br>
example, medieval christians; they demurr and state, invariably &quot; those were 
<br>
not really christians&quot; R-i-i-i-ig-g-g-h-h-ht! They were Martians that did the 
<br>
killing.  Capitalist never murder, those were not real capitalists! 
<br>

<p>&lt;&lt; Sorry, Speer's account has held up quite well to all cross examination.
<br>
&nbsp;Apparently you have not read it. Knowing of camp's existence and knowing what
<br>
&nbsp;went on inside them are two completely different things, which you 
<br>
apparently do
<br>
&nbsp;not seem to be able to distinguish. Speer did not find out about the goings 
<br>
on
<br>
&nbsp;until late in the war, and did not know how broad the 'final solution' was
<br>
&nbsp;carried out until after the war. He has acknowledged that when he found out 
<br>
about
<br>
&nbsp;the production line exections, etc. that his first reaction to his fellow war
<br>
&nbsp;prisoners was 'what a waste', because his attitude then was that he needed 
<br>
those
<br>
&nbsp;people to work.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;No historian has been able to find documentation at all outside of the SS 
<br>
that
<br>
&nbsp;disclosed any policy of systematic killing, except for that at the top which
<br>
&nbsp;involved Hitler.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; AEG pre-existed before the 3rd Reich ever existed, and probably pre-dated 
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em> &gt; Weimar Republic. The German insurance company, Allianz (alliance) was 
</em><br>
afraid
<br>
<em> &gt; it would have to pay indemnities to its Jewish clients after Chrystal 
</em><br>
Nacht,
<br>
<em> &gt; till Hermann Goering reassured Allianz, it would never have to do so. (The
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Rise and Fall of the 3rd Reich) By the way, Allianz just payed off some
</em><br>
<em> &gt; indemnities to their former clients just in 1999, LOL!
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Its Kristallnacht, BTW. What does it matter that Allianz predates the Weimar
<br>
&nbsp;Rep.? That says nothing toward your claims that Nazis were capitalists, 
<br>
which you
<br>
&nbsp;have yet to show any documentation supporting.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; You know I haven't mentioned what the Belgian Minning companies did to the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Central Africans in the llate 19th century. These guys were capitalists 
</em><br>
also.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Sorry, they did what they did under a national charter, with plenipotentiary
<br>
&nbsp;police powers, and the central africans were hardly any sort of saints of
<br>
&nbsp;democracy or civilization.
<br>
<em> &gt; Its a more complicated issue then you seem to acknowledge.  Perhaps you or
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; Milt Friedman may make a decent case for harnessing capitalism to promote
</em><br>
<em> &gt; ethical behavior as a decent side-effect? But the blood doesn't wash out as
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Shakesphere said much more elloquently; a lot of evil has been done in the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; past. Slavery was capitalistic, albeit a hideously evil, form of it. I 
</em><br>
stand
<br>
<em> &gt; by my assetions, which might be clarified as &quot;making money is very nice,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; doing evil (we need to define this!) to accomplish it crosses the line&quot;
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;You come up with a few small minor cases, when the facts are that the Nazis 
<br>
and
<br>
&nbsp;the Soviets, both being socialists, committed hundreds and thousands of times
<br>
&nbsp;more crimes against humanity than any capitalist ever did. &gt;&gt;
