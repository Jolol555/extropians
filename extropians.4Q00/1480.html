One thing that should be done on the extropy site post-haste is to have
<br>
a real secure form and credit card processing available.  It is quite
<br>
embarrassing for a bunch of futurists to have grossly outmoded online
<br>
order and payment services.  I was not at all pleased on upgrading my
<br>
membership to see a post-submit screen that says &quot;details emailed to...&quot;
<br>
some extropy address.  Does this mean my credit card number was sent
<br>
over unsecure email?  This is very bad and quite amateur.  Use some of
<br>
the fees collected to fix such nonsense.  AFAIK it is not that expensive
<br>
to either process it yourselves or sign up with a service that can
<br>
process secure credit card orders.
