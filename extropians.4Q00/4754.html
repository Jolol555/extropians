<p>Hi Charlie,
<br>
<p>I don't have any pets, but I have had pets in the past.  For example, from time
<br>
to time I watch pets for other people, when they are out of town.  So I can
<br>
spend some time with the pet.  Depending on leash laws in your area and if you
<br>
fence your yard or keep your pets inside, then the pets interact while no one
<br>
else is there.  So, if you had a robotic pet, then it could interact with them.
<br>
<p>I don't have any children that is a much different matter.  When it comes to
<br>
people, they can have their own pets.
<br>
<p>I have had a turtle and dogs, cats, hamsters, fish, a rabbit, and some more
<br>
fish, in no order.  I have watched outdoor animals.  I have seen bears and
<br>
rattlesnakes in the wild.
<br>
<p>For example, there is this cat Alex.  Alex is a yellow tabby cat.  He lives
<br>
outside.  Sometimes he hunts birds or squirrels, but he is mostly past that.  He
<br>
walks around the area.  I thought about getting a dog but it takes a lot of
<br>
space.
<br>
<p>So, about robots, a robot is a pretty familiar icon in culture.  A robot can
<br>
exist for some of the same purposes that provide benefit for the same benefits
<br>
that the pets provide.
<br>
<p>Ross
