<em>&gt;  Matthew, global warming was old news by 1989.  I remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  hearing about it when I was in elementary school in the 1960s.
</em><br>
<p>The world wide web was old news to us original arpanet folks. 
<br>
Hypertext was proposed in 1965 by Ted Nelson, and was demonstrated 
<br>
with a mouse by Andy van Dam and others who build the Hypertext 
<br>
Editing System in 1967.
<br>
<p>By the time this &quot;prediction&quot; was made in 1989, Apple's HyperCard 
<br>
implementation of hypertext had been bundled with Macintoshes for two 
<br>
years.  Many papers and workshops had been held on hypertext.  In 
<br>
March of that year, CERN had published its proposal to standardize 
<br>
the hypertext mark-up language to provide consistency across all 
<br>
vendors.
