In a perfect world, you'd be right.
<br>
<p>The sampling approach presupposes that we can measure and tabulate all
<br>
that matters. We might think we can, and later be proven wrong.
<br>
Mitochondrial DNA for sure is being swept under the rug in most
<br>
discussions of cloning. What if methylation turns out to be influenced
<br>
by subtle prion-like heritable things? 
<br>
<p>We are talking about the future of the human race, after all. It pays us
<br>
to be prudent. A prudent ecologist tries to remember from time to time
<br>
that he might not really understand all of what's going on. So does a
<br>
prudent particle physicist. Why should a prudent transhuman
<br>
primatologist not do so?

<p>It's not just about the labels we put on people, Mike. Ever hear of
<br>
phrenology? Well-meaning scientistic know-it-alls have been categorizing
<br>
people for centuries. They have not been right very often so far.
<br>
<p>I am trying to apply pancritical rationalism to the notion of wild,
<br>
gotta-have-'em, go-go adoption of designer genes. We probably won't be
<br>
paving paradise to put up a parking lot--on purpose. But we should do
<br>
what we can to keep a broad population base of controls of all the human
<br>
gene pool just in case NuGene Z23456 turns out to be A Bad Thing That
<br>
Got Locked In.
