Well, as long as we are reminiscing about computers, my first experience in 
<br>
computing was with the lovely Apple IIc, programming BASIC and LOGO right 
<br>
from the command prompt. I guess that was about 1980, I was in 2nd grade 
<br>
Academically Gifted program and we were lucky enough to have 2 or 3 Apples 
<br>
around for us to kick around with. I remember my first few programs were 
<br>
horrid attempts to re-create the WARGAMES  W.O.P.R. &quot;Would you like to play a 
<br>
game?&quot; , and of course, who could forget seeing Eliza's reactions to 
<br>
inputting dirty words and phrases!
<br>
<p>My first home computer was a Timex Sinclair with 2k of memory, you had to 
<br>
hook up a regular cassette player to store the programs. I then took the leap 
<br>
to the STAGGERING ::grin:: computing power of the Commodore 64! I remember 
<br>
well typing in hundreds of lines of code from magazines like RUN and 
<br>
Commodore User. Onward into history, I finally convinced my folks to shell 
<br>
out big bucks for my 486SX25. I actually spent 100 bucks on a friggin math 
<br>
coprocessor! can you believe it! From then on, the sky was the limit.
<br>
<p>I rather enjoy the horror stories people come up with regarding 80lb hard 
<br>
drive crashes (literally!) and tearing out your hair over that ONE punch card 
<br>
that got away, or typos on the teletype machine, etc. My how we have grown, 
<br>
but on the other hand, my my my do we have a long way to go! I just wish that 
<br>
Billy Gates, IBM, and all those other brains involved in early computer 
<br>
development had though far enough ahead to design systems that were flexible 
<br>
enough to handle unlimited expansion of memory, processing speed/power, and 
<br>
storage capacity. It would have saved many a headache and hours of work 
<br>
configuring and re-configuring hardware and software so that it worked 
<br>
without causing too much grief! Plug and play my ass! LOL
<br>
<p>TTFN!
