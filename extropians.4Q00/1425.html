controlling and directing the power, isn't it?

</em><br>
<p>It depends a great deal on your definition of &quot;important&quot;.  Not all
<br>
things that are important require being on the expansion wave.  Some
<br>
things require not being on that wave but being more of a home-body
<br>
exploring within concept spaces rather than physical ones.  There is no
<br>
reason to assume the best science and conceptual work is done on the
<br>
physical wavefront.  
<br>
<p>Most of all there is no reason to assume that the most important thing
<br>
bar none is physical expansion of territory and resources covered. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; reason to assume everything is explanable and predictable according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; auto-replication models or by comparing super-intelligent species and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; their agents to RNA.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Super-intelligent species are also subject to the laws of physics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution. And the point is precisely that you don't need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-intelligent (in fact quite to opposite, it adds to the overhead)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to sustain a wave propagation across the cosmic substrate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Last time I checked evolution does not lay down what the selection
<br>
process is for all species and sentiences for all time.  Replication is
<br>
simply one selection criteria.  
<br>
<p>The laws of physics are a study in progress.  We can't make utterly hard
<br>
predictions of what we will discover to be the most up-to-date
<br>
understanding of physics a bit down the road.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Not so.  You do not need to synch action across huge volumes to stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; encroachment on protected areas.  Local intelligent defenses of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; sufficient caliber will be adequate.  The encroachment is limited by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; even greater constraints than speed of light communication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You've reinvented Eliezer's sysop, only inserted from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside. Notice that the observable universe, if not a collossal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Potyemkin's facade, is incompartible with anyone powerful. You need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have presence and massive gunpower coupled with absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-restraint. 
</em><br>
<p>I'm not attempting to cover the entire universe or even the entire
<br>
galaxy.  Just enough to protect the hatching grounds of new races where
<br>
they have been encountered.  It would be a pretty pathetic
<br>
post-singularity species that could not reasonably take on that size of
<br>
task.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; That's a lot of hefty assumptions. How exactly, will a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superciv prevent the propagation of wavefront? 
</em><br>
<p>It does not need to.  Simply direct it around what is protected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can only call back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the seeds as long your technological advance makes you faster. Notice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the seeds get selected for speed. 
</em><br>
<p><p>I have covered this at least four times.  The Protectors got there first
<br>
and installed reasonable measures.  And/or the early species simply do
<br>
not let other species out of their bubbles until they agree to abide by
<br>
certain reasonable restraints.  Or post-Singularity species self select
<br>
for some such niceness in that the ones that don't have it end up
<br>
turning against themselves or simply not advancing as fast and
<br>
gracefully as the ones who do have it. 
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; If you tarry even a little, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lose your speed advantage (intercepting something which sets out to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cover a distance of a few lightyears from a distance of 100 lightyears
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no small feat, plus consider the volume you have to police, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expand into -- your expansion fleet technology must be exceedingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brittle to not to engender an even more fatal growth front -- since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're already so fast and reckless to start with).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Speed, speed, speed.  What a boring mind trip that would be.  Is all of
<br>
our work just about who can grab and converted the most resources the
<br>
quickest into more of themselves?  Is a souped up version of the bad
<br>
guys in &quot;Independence Day&quot; (yes I know they were lame and it was a lame
<br>
movie) the best we can think to produce?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; What pray tell is real physics post-Singularity?  It is to laugh to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; dismiss &quot;science fiction physics&quot; out of hand.  What a science fiction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Something which exists outside of limit of known physics does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist in the scientific context. Since we're at least trying to upkeep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a mirage of science, this really helps to stick to known facts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Oh, yes it does.  The fact that we do not know everything and cannot
<br>
predict what we do not yet know and its implications is very important
<br>
to the scientific enterprise.  I posited nothing that is a priori
<br>
impossible.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; writer can come up with today is merely a jumping off point for the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; scientists today.  Post-singularity with vastly increased and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; concentrated intelligence much that is science-fiction will be child's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; play.  The inner areas of galaxies?  If they are sterile of life it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; probably due to higher radiation, asteroid bombardment and so on.  At
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; least sterile of life as we usually define it.  Post-SI entities could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; probably exist and thrive in some remarkably &quot;sterile&quot; environments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is very true, but I was talking about emergence of biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life. Since it can't emerge there, it has to emerge elsewhere, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; migrate in. You don't see metabolism signatures of anything smart out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there. So we're not in their lightcone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Or we are in a protection bubble.  I wonder about those roving planets
<br>
with fairly strong heat signatures though.  :-) 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Not in the least.  I simply expect intelligence, esepcially much higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; intelligence to manage to make and keep agreements that increase its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You assume intelligence as a shining clear single 100 ct gem. I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to disappoint you, statistical behaviour of large groups of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent beings entangled in a darwinian process does follow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger-scale behaviour. It's messy. They're also only doing blind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization. There's is no homunculus inside your brain, and crowds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of smart people do not necessarily act intelligently themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, it seems to me that we are learning to untangle ourselves from
<br>
some aspects of a Darwinian process we had little/no control over and
<br>
are gaining some freedom to specify some of the rules of the game for
<br>
the next process we will work/live inside of.  I just want us to not
<br>
apply old rules we understand in a context where the drivers and
<br>
determiners of those rules are or can be largely missing, especially
<br>
where it is us to us to specify largely what the new drivers and context
<br>
is.

<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; overall benefits and avoid too much conflict and chaos.  I would rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; bet on that than bet that a model based on replicating bacteria is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; applicable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Smarter beings can only help if their intelligence is correlated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster and farther travel. It is not obvious why this should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true. Reckless replication and minimal complexity (=less baggage to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replicate) as well as fast travel (possibly invented by advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings somewhere far behind the wavefront and lost their intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baggage along the way) are the most obvious components of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wavefront fitness function. Unless there's a reason why empathy gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conserved when interacting with players which can't reciprocate, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not obvious why the gods should care. To them, universe is either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sterile, or god-grade already. If it's sterile (in their eyes we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biofilm -- but we'll upgrade to full blown deity pretty soon), it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theirs to take. We won't stop mining Mars just because there might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few primitive bacteria up there, won't we? If it's god grade, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shake hands and exchange pleasantries with their peers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  If we have super fast adaptable grey goo with just enough
<br>
technology to move at near light speed given any reasonable
<br>
concentrations of energy-matter ever so often then they can eat the
<br>
entire universe.  But it is a pretty boring goal for all of our lifes,
<br>
hopes and dreams isn't it?   You can make a good argument that it is a
<br>
reasonable concern of at least some  less boring post-Singularity
<br>
species to make more of themselves and to be expansive enough to get out
<br>
and there and make room for other species to not get eaten early by
<br>
themselves or any other species. Not mandatory but certainly a
<br>
worthwhile goal.  
<br>
<p>Empathy is conserved because life is a lot more interesting than
<br>
non-life and because there is a need for and perhaps a delight in, 
<br>
&quot;not-us&quot; diversity.  Gods were not always gods and I imagine it would be
<br>
at least a bit less boring if other godlings were born now and then. You
<br>
(and I) have no business whatsoever claiming conclusively how a &quot;god&quot;
<br>
will or will not see the universe and especially other life.  What we
<br>
may or may not do with Mars is irrelevant.  Mars is not nearly as
<br>
profitable to mine as the asteroids for now anyway.  
<br>
<p>Your argument is as silly as saying adults have no use for children.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Dunno.  We would miss serious nanotech level defenses in say the Oort
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Cloud today.  Hell, we would miss significant nanotech level presence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is the universe sterile? Why are all these resources laying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fallow? Even virtual navelgazing can profit from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parallelism. Computers couple to physical reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We can barely manage to see any non-sterility out there.  We can sit
<br>
here all day and posit technology and activities that our current tools
<br>
would not notice as marks of intelligent behavior.  We could be very
<br>
early OR we are in a bubble either accidentally or on purpose OR we are
<br>
surrounded by high level activity that we simply do not recognize yet.  
<br>
Perhaps a bit of a mixture.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; even on earth. What makes you think for a second that the more advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; and more moral species will stand for the fast dumb brutes marching
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; roughshod over the developing races?  Personally I would tend to protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; developing races and make sure they don't get too far out into the rest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; of the galaxy while they still are &quot;dumb brutes&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They're not &quot;still&quot;, they're *already* dumb brutes. Cyanobacteria
</em><br>
<em>&gt; typically don't develop interstellar travel. Keeping on running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without making a stop is not something which I associate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent behaviour.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK.  We agree there.  I think.  Are you saying that all post singularity
<br>
species are not dumb brutes but would still tend to eat any developing
<br>
species on their path?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Sigh. You seem unable to think beyond your own model of endless conflict
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; to see that it is actually in the interest of intelligent species to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; cooperate and that it might be considered in their interest to carefully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is only in the interest of intelligent species to cooperate if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can profit from the interaction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So now you assume that you can understand for all time all the motives
<br>
of vastly more intelligent species and reduce them to the single word
<br>
&quot;profit&quot;.  Do you assume that you understand what such intelligences
<br>
would and would not find &quot;profitable&quot; or important?  Here on the edge of
<br>
becoming such a species ourselves I think we need to think pretty hard
<br>
about what type of species we will become and what we will define as
<br>
important and profitable ourselves.  We cannot afford for ourselves or
<br>
others to just assume we know what that is and can plan and predict on
<br>
those assumptions.  The Singularity grows out of being able to transcend
<br>
the rules we have lived under until now in large part and define the
<br>
shape of ourselves and our future to a quite large extent.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; guard the development of young species.  It is not that hard to set up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; agreements between species that have mutual interests and agreements
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; about what is important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know where you're coming from (I've been there before) but you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refuse to see where the logic of this all is leading this to. You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have to like it (I don't) but you have to acknowledge it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The funny thing about logic is that it largely only works out the full
<br>
consequences of your assumptions.  I question what seems to be the
<br>
assumptions.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; If you can expand, you will. If you can't or won't, you're irrelevant,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; because no one is ever going to interact with you. Hence either Rare
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Earth, or the Zoo.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Expansion is not the end and be all that you attempt to make it.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, but if you don't expand you'll never be observed and interact with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anybody else but a passing pioneer front -- which is then supposedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no problem for you. The universe is a large place, and intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life nucleation density seems to be very low. (Though it is difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see how a species of billions of spatially distant diverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals (it is not easy to see how any wet life can produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything else) can agree to never venture outside of the small ring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they set to themselves -- notice about the properties of individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who chose to do so, the first step of self-selection).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What small ring?  Space is vast nearly beyond imagining.  More than
<br>
enough room not to run over other less advanced species along the way. 
<br>
I am not saying no expansion.  Pioneers and expansion are a great
<br>
thing.  They are simply not the only or the only really, really
<br>
important thing.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; are other things of massive importance that make an individual or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; species worth interacting with.  Expansion does not equate to mindless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We're not an advanced species. We're not worth interacting with on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equal footing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but are we worth protecting while we grow up?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; expansion that destroys and consumes everything else other than itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; regardless.  In all the vastness of space other life might be rare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know, you've said that often enough, but you never falsified the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons of why the wavefront critters will be nasty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Nor have you proven them.  Both are build on differing assumptions.  And
<br>
mine is also build on the assumption that we get to choose how we will
<br>
behave when we encounter such species.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; enough to be held quite special and worthy of respect and room to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; develop.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Doesn't compute.
</em><br>
<p><p>If life is as scarce as you posit it certainly does compute.
