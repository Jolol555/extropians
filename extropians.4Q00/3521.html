<p>Hmm. So you are all for actual major government nastiness if the money
<br>
extorted or whatever goes to fund what you care most about?  How far
<br>
does that go?  Are you willing to see people robbed, beaten, even killed
<br>
to fund this stuff?  Do the ends utterly justify the means in your
<br>
mind?  
<br>
<p>The sword of government tyranny cuts two ways.  Today it may seem
<br>
supportive of some of the goals you want.  Tomorrow it make be
<br>
sacrificing you and all you care about to someone else's goals that have
<br>
caught the ever shifting government focus.  And through all of it the
<br>
government will be the only consistent winner and the people the
<br>
consistent losers.  You give the government the rope to hang you with
<br>
when you use it against others to get what you want.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;HUH?  Call me a simpleton but I thought Libertarianism was about people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;doing it their way wherever that does not infringe on the rights of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;others to do the same.  The above seems to assume that a lot of people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;legitimate interests are in conflict much of the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Re-structuring government is forcing people to live under your system, if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large number of them don't want it. A limited-function libertarian government is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not what most people want, or we'd have it, and were we to get it over their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposition, we'd be forcing them to live under a system they don't agree with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, the point then is, what do we do? We can tell people government is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiating force by making us pay taxes, but they largely don't agree. Giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them facts, reasons, etc. won't matter, since their values aren't ours, and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't going to connect things as we do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No.  I am not forcing anyone to do anything  but leave me alone.  All  I
<br>
ask for is a negative, the absence of  coercion.  If you want to be
<br>
really twisted I guess you can say I am denying someone's right to
<br>
murder, plunder and enslave me.  But to say that would assume there is
<br>
such a thing as some right to do these things.  I don't care what people
<br>
agree with. I care whether or not they live with me and one another in a
<br>
remotely civilized manner.  
<br>
<p>If all the facts don't matter then you come to the same position as the
<br>
Marxists that there is no truth but only the truth of this or that
<br>
group.  From that point chaos and tyranny run rampant.  We should do as
<br>
much as possible to avoid that. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Again, &quot;make them do it anyway&quot; is no part of what I thought Libertarianism was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;From this and other things you've said, I can tell you're a fan of Ayn Rand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe even an objectivist. (I'm trying not to make a definitive statement, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose. I'm also trying to illustrate a point, rather than this being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal attack). I read everything of hers I could find (except We, the Living)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I was 20. However, now, I don't like her work nearly as much, it strikes me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as too simplistic. 
</em><br>
<p>Whether I admire much of Ayn Rand's work or not, I do but abhor the
<br>
little pipsqueak that claims to be her heir and all of his works and the
<br>
rationalistic ninnies that too often seem drawn to objectivism, is
<br>
really irrelevant to this discussion.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, I have to make myself not turn off what you're saying.
</em><br>
<p>Your emotions are irrelevant.  Give me your reasoning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why? Because almost every objectivist I've met comes off sounding like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious fundamentalist. For example, I once took a FAQ on capitalism from an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objectivist web page. I then replaced the word capitalism with the word Jesus,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then read the parts which describe capitalism's benefits (making sure not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read the parts which mentioned specifically economic ideas) to some friends. ALL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them thought I was reading a religious tract.
</em><br>
<p>Well, wasn't that majorly enlightening?  NOT.  You could take many
<br>
random tracts and replace the main subject with &quot;Jesus&quot; and people would
<br>
think you were reading religion. Again, would you come back to the
<br>
points at hand?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      Why bring this up? Most people will shut you out if they think you're an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideologue, and we get nowhere. Despite libertarian theory, we live in a world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where most people don't agree with us, and we get nothing done telling them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're not bright enough to understand how much we know. Telling them they've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stolen the food they're eating, when it came from government, is going to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to mark you as a nut, and you get nowhere.
</em><br>
<p>But I have patiently said over and over again that this is not what I
<br>
do, plan to do or advocate doing.  It is you who created this strawman.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The main parties have not dared mention or name their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fundamental principles for some time now.  There is a great emptiness in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;American politics waiting to be filled.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, one person DID say people were stupid. It's what got me started on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>People generally ARE stupid.  Half of them have IQs of 100 or less! 
<br>
:-)  A good deal of the brightest are voluntarily stupid in areas they
<br>
have had no training in since our education system does not teach sound
<br>
critical thinking.  This isn't flamage.  It is the simple truth.  So if
<br>
you need everyone's buy-in before anything gets done you may as well
<br>
forget it.  But if you can have the system be truly minimalist giving
<br>
the people that do see what needs doing the maximum freedom to proceed
<br>
without coercion or coercing others, then that is probably the best that
<br>
can be acheived.  Even relatively stupid people can see it is in their
<br>
interest not to be coerced and can even see what types of systems tend
<br>
to produce the most goodies.
