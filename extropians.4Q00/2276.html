</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Love, compassion and so on are also emotions.  It is questionable
<br>
whether an intelligence with no emotions whatsoever would ever really
<br>
care much or be motivated by much.  Your certainty is an interesting
<br>
opinion but it is not certain.  The Vulcans as I see them rigorously
<br>
control and channel emotional energy but I think it is technically
<br>
incorrect to say they actually have no emotions.  As I understood Star
<br>
Trek fantasy space the species actually had a super-abundance of emotion
<br>
that required such control to avoid mass destruction.
<br>
<p>Whether the AI experiences the human equivalent emotion called hate or
<br>
not I am just as screwed if the AI logically concludes that I am a
<br>
danger to it or that the universe would be a nicer place (in some cooly
<br>
logic derived way of course) without me in it.
