<em>&gt; &gt;I.e., how to get around the fact that women almost universally treat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;any interaction with them as a special privilege which should be paid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;for? Sometimes I wish that I lived in one the more natural cultures,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;like I've occasionally run into in rural Mexico, where women didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;craftilly measure every gram of emotion they allowed a man to see .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did you really mean to say this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Obviously someone has been badly hurt somewhere.  Women measure each
<br>
gram of emotion?  HAH!  Women are so much freer with emotion than men
<br>
(generally speaking) that this is to laugh.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would I say it otherwise?  Taken in context - or even by itself (note my cultural comparison), it is obvious that I am speaking about a particular culture - perhaps I should have been clearer that I am referring specifically to S. California.  Discussion follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I was not aware that S. California is isolated enough to get such
<br>
uniformity across an entire gender.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; There are certain diseases of the facial area that effect only women, very &gt;rarely men. 
</em><br>
<p>Really?  Like what?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It has been medically ascertained that these are caused by the state of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extreme tension women exert upon their facial muscles in order to directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control what expression they project.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I have known lots of men who were this uptight about controlling their
<br>
facially expression but the only women I've known like this were ones
<br>
under some durress not to show what they felt.  Men have often been
<br>
exposed to cultural pressures that it is not manly to express emotion
<br>
easily and very uncool to show too much on one's face.  Women veil their
<br>
expression when they think they will subject them to ridicule, abuse,
<br>
unwanted flirtation or worse.  Otherwise women are extremely open in
<br>
their facial expressions.  Much more so than men.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I haven't investigated this further than the original report which I ran 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accross recently in connection with life extension research.  I will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tentatively predict, however, that there is major variance in the incidence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the problem among different cultures of similar genetic heritage.  I &gt;would also expect to see that among the rare male incidence, it would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mostly concentrated with gays, and perhaps secondarily with asian men.
</em><br>
<p>You are a piece of work.  You take an unsubstantiated report, use it to
<br>
boost empty generalizations and then on the basis of no more than that
<br>
go on to make even more vaporous generalizations and aspersions on other
<br>
groups.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why?  Because, like women, gay men are notorious for adopting poses, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even wearing makeup, involving much studying of their faces, with the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;goal of controlling effect.  
</em><br>
<p>If you knew anything about acting or projecting emotion you would know
<br>
that it requires learning to loosen up one's expressive ability and
<br>
facial muscles, build up the emotions and persona one wants to convey
<br>
within and then let that play through the face and body.  It is not
<br>
about rigidly controlling.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(Note that &quot;butch&quot; lesbians especially tend to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be on the opposite end of the spectrum - wearing their hearts on their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sleeves, and little or no makeuup.  One would expect, therefore, a lower incidence with them.) 
</em><br>
<p>What?  You never met a 'stone' butch?  There are butch lesbians who
<br>
think it is uncool to show to much emotion on their faces or what they
<br>
think.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Asian cultures also focus on the maintenance of &quot;face,&quot; which means much &gt;more than the mere physical visage, but includes the concept of the perfect &gt;playing of a role or pose again, if only in maintaining a perfectly blank &gt;expression.  Skill at treachery or deception is prized in many Asian &gt;cultures.
</em><br>
<p>OK.  I have better things to do.  Sheesh.
