<p>Gambling with the Earth
<br>
<p>If physicists create killer strangelets, we're all doomed. Should we
<br>
take the risk?
<br>
<p>THE probability that dangerous Earth-devouring particles will be born
<br>
at a new particle accelerator in the US may be tiny, but scientists
<br>
have played down the devastating potential costs in their risk
<br>
assessments, a physicist now says.
<br>
<p>Adrian Kent of Cambridge University accepts that the chances of
<br>
catastrophe are minuscule. But he claims physicists are not accounting
<br>
for the scale of the potential devastation--the destruction of the
<br>
entire planet--in their risk analysis. &quot;Small catastrophe risks are
<br>
more costly than we've generally considered,&quot; says Kent.
<br>
<p>Last year, sensational newspaper reports suggested that a new particle
<br>
accelerator, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven
<br>
National Laboratory on Long Island, could put the Earth in peril. The
<br>
accelerator might create blobs of matter called strangelets containing
<br>
&quot;strange&quot; quarks, as well as the usual &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; types in
<br>
ordinary matter. If a strangelet were stable and negatively charged,
<br>
it might begin eating the nuclei of ordinary matter, converting them
<br>
into strange matter. Eventually this could consume the entire Earth.
<br>
<p>Physicists reassured the public by pointing out that such a chain of
<br>
events is nigh-on impossible (New Scientist, 28 August 1999, p
<br>
24). The main reason for their confidence is that it's very unlikely
<br>
that strangelets would be stable or negatively charged.
<br>
<p>Astronomical evidence is also reassuring. Heavy ion collisions occur
<br>
naturally, for instance when cosmic rays smash into heavy nuclei on
<br>
the Moon. Yet the Moon has existed for 5 billion years without being
<br>
devoured by a ravenous strangelet.
<br>
<p>Arnon Dar, Alvaro De Rújula and Ulrich Heinz of the CERN particle
<br>
physics laboratory near Geneva used the fact that stars are not being
<br>
changed into strange matter at a significant rate to calculate the
<br>
maximum probability of the Brookhaven collider creating a dangerous
<br>
strangelet during the accelerator's lifetime.  The result was less
<br>
than 20 chances in a billion, which the team called &quot;a safe and
<br>
stringent upper bound&quot; (Physics Letters B, vol 470, p 142). Thus
<br>
reassured, the Brookhaven lab set RHIC running in June.
<br>
<p>But Kent now argues that this probability is far from acceptable when
<br>
compared with risk assessments of other possible hazards, which factor
<br>
in the scale of the devastation if things go wrong. He points out that
<br>
radiological protection policy in Britain deems it unacceptable for
<br>
solid nuclear waste to pose more than a one-in-a-million chance of
<br>
killing around five people a year on average. To achieve the same
<br>
level of risk, global annihilation by a strangelet would have to have
<br>
a probability of 1 in 10­15 or less, because it has the potential to
<br>
wipe out all 6 billion people on the planet.
<br>
<p>John Marburger, director of the Brook-haven lab, does not accept this
<br>
line of argument. He says that the risk limit calculated by the CERN
<br>
researchers was not a safety assessment in the sense used in nuclear
<br>
energy safety analysis. &quot;In my opinion, no such risk assessment is
<br>
possible,&quot; says Marburger. &quot;We do not know how a 'dangerous
<br>
strangelet' would be created, and we do not know the properties of one
<br>
if it were.&quot;
<br>
<p>De Rújula agrees. &quot;We've been standing on our heads to try to convince
<br>
people it's not true and to come up with limits on it, and this number
<br>
comes from very, very pessimistic assumptions.&quot; He says it is &quot;absurd&quot;
<br>
to take such a minuscule maximum probability and multiply it by the
<br>
number of people who would die if a strangelet swallowed the
<br>
world. &quot;It's not going to happen,&quot; he says.
