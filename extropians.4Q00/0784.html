<p>Doug, this is very important news for me (I have a long standing dissagreement
<br>
with a female friend over the issue of flies naturally undergoing 'cryonic
<br>
suspension'. She is a biochemistry grad student, and insists this is not
<br>
possible). Growing up here in northern new england, I know from personal
<br>
experience that flies frequently hybernate in a frozen state in the cracks of
<br>
logs and elsewhere. I've seen this from bringing into my parents house pieces of
<br>
wood for their wood stove that were frozen solid in ambient temperatures of -10
<br>
to -30 degrees F (not counting wind chill), and stacking them next to the stove
<br>
to warm up and unfreeze. Doing so causes flies hybernating in the cracks to come
<br>
back to life, and obviously annoy us by buzzing around once they recover. I have
<br>
also witnessed a fly, frozen in the crack of a stup of a tree, come back to life
<br>
as the sun rose and began to warm it above the freezing point. I do not know
<br>
what sort of flies you are using, but the ones I refer too seem to be some sort
<br>
of wild house fly that is common to these parts, but I am no entomologist.
