Subject: Re: Gematria, Cryptology, and Extropic Mysticism
<br>
<p>I think the problem here is that people mix up mysticism,
<br>
spirituality, magick and the supernatural.
<br>
<p><p>(Hej Anders,
<br>
Yea, sorry, everything's the same to me.
<br>
I write pages, but summarize and generalize them into single words.)
<br>
Mysticism, spirituality, magick, and the supernatural
<br>
all represent the same crap.
<br>
It's all weird stuff that really effects you deeply.
<br>
It's weird and deep stuff.
<br>
Deep stuff is weird, and everything effects you somehow,
<br>
so I guess it's all just stuff isn't it?
<br>
I went from 4 distinct subsets into their superset and related their 
<br>
superset to all sets and the point of all this is...
<br>
WHAT'S THE POINT!
<br>
IT'S ALL STUFF!
<br>
I'm sick of people saying this or that is or is not extropian!
<br>
USE IT!
<br>
SEE IF IT HELPS!
<br>
SHUT UP AND DO SOMETHING!
<br>
WORDS ARE CHEAP!
<br>
We are talking here again.
<br>
I've been here for years.
<br>
This list has not done much for me but waste my time.
<br>
WHY ARE WE HERE?
<br>
There are so many geniuses here...
<br>
SOMEBODY MUST HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY!?!
<br>
SAY IT!!
<br>
I am losing all hope.
<br>
I've been a transhumanist for years
<br>
and all I've learned how to do is alienate myself
<br>
by doing things that nobody else does.
<br>
All my friends smoke and drink and race towards the grave while getting 
<br>
blowjobs in fast cars on their way to stuff their faces with fast food and I 
<br>
have to sit and watch them all die one by one.
<br>
In my mind I already think of them as walking corpses.
<br>
Nobody trys to live to be 150.
<br>
Nobody eats right or exercises.
<br>
Nobody studies the things I study.
<br>
(replace &quot;nobody&quot; with &quot;only people that don't give a damn about me&quot;.)
<br>
How in the hell am I going to be able to upload my brain?!?
<br>
Is Joe Strout going to do it for me?
<br>
Not likely.
<br>
How am I going to live on an intergalactic starship
<br>
to avoid planetary extinction?
<br>
Is NASA going to let me on when they build one in the year 3500?
<br>
Not likely.
<br>
How am I going to survive that long?
<br>
I can make it to 150 if I don't starve to death.
<br>
As it is I can't even afford to feed myself.
<br>
I'm seriously thinking about moving to Antarctica to hunt seals
<br>
because I have no place to live, I'm homeless, poor, anti-social
<br>
(at least towards the average intelligences)
<br>
I hate everything about everything
<br>
because it all represents what I'm trying to overcome.
<br>
Everything should be better.
<br>
There is no place in society for me because I am trying to make a better 
<br>
society and society doesn't want to help me change it.
<br>
I boycott and I strike because I see evil everywhere.
<br>
It's killing me.
<br>
I'm going to die and I'm furious.
<br>
Do any of you think the world wants to change,
<br>
to be changed,
<br>
by you?
<br>
I can't do this by myself and neither can you,
<br>
but I don't see anybody helping me.
<br>
People have underground cities that I would love to live in,
<br>
but would they let me...
<br>
NO!
<br>
I want to take a ride in the shuttle...
<br>
HAH!
<br>
I want to be a nice guy,
<br>
but more and more
<br>
it seems like I'll have to do alot of killing and stealing
<br>
to get anything done.
<br>
I'll have to destroy democracy to protect us from the idiots who make the 
<br>
worlds average IQ plummet.
<br>
Nobody will help me with that.
<br>
The world has the technology to achieve great things,
<br>
but since it's not our stuff then it won't be used for our ideas
<br>
and even if it is used for our ideas &quot;they&quot; are not going to let us use it.)
<br>
<p><p><p>Mysticism is the epistemological position that some truths can or must
<br>
be grasped by direct insight, not empirical thought.  Spirituality is
<br>
about meaning, the core values that we have. It doesn't have to
<br>
involve any spirits.  Magick,
<br>
<p><p><p>(There it is the magick word.
<br>
Does anybody know any magick?
<br>
We need all we can get.)
<br>
<p><p>Transhumanism is out to improve the human condition using efficient
<br>
means.
<br>
<p><p><p>(Are we doing it?)
