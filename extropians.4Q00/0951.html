<em>&gt;I find it striking that people seem to think that the speed and nature of

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;You seem to have a plausible model of how societies improve their
<br>
collective IQ and of how individuals are able to utilize social knowledge.
<br>
&nbsp;But IQ tests appear to do a fairly good job of filtering out these effects
<br>
and measuring mainly what individuals can do in isolation. It is hard to
<br>
believe that this is affected by the compute cycles of the rest of humanity.
<br>
&nbsp;I was mainly reacting to your claim that you had a good explanation for
<br>
the Flynn effect. Your model may well describe some effects that will be
<br>
important in predicting the social effects of AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  My current hypothesis for what is causing the Flynn effect is based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the kind of sexual selection that is described in The Mating Mind. I
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Most observers don't think there has been enough time for selection to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have much changed intelligence over the last century.  And your hypothesis
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Most people have underestimated the effects of sexual selection, and
<br>
this has caused them to underestimate the maximum speed of evolution.
<br>
Do you know of any analysis which says sexual selection can't cause
<br>
IQ changes this quickly?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;seems to me the opposite of the Mating Mind idea as I understood it.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought the ability to earn a living was mainly just taken as a signal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the fitness of your genes.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;The Mating Mind talks mainly about measures of fitness which are stable
<br>
over time, but doesn't appear to exclude context-sensitive fitness measures.
