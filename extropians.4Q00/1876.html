<em>&gt; I don't think it makes sense to talk about side effects of changing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discount rates, because that isn't a specific policy which can have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such effects.  You could talk about the side effects of changing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest rates, or rates of taxation on capital, or subsidizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education, etc.  But social discount rates are just a feature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social preferences - and preferences don't have side effects, actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do.
</em><br>
<p>But the authors do make policy suggestions.  In fact I take this to be
<br>
the main point of the paper.  The abstract concludes, &quot;Our analysis has
<br>
immediate implications for public policy: agents discount the future
<br>
too much and the government should promote future oriented policies.&quot;
<br>
They write, in section 4.1,
<br>
<p>&quot;Relative to the market evaluation, our analysis tips the scales in
<br>
favor of policies with short run costs and long run benefits.  In the
<br>
area of fiscal policy, it favors subsidies to capital accumulation.
<br>
In the area of monetary policy, it favors low inflation.  In the area
<br>
of natural resource extraction, it favors conservation.  In general,
<br>
it favors investment and saving at the expense of consumption.&quot;
<br>
<p>My complaint is that the authors have not shown that these suggestions
<br>
will achieve their goal of better satisfying people's preferences.
<br>
Making these changes may cause disruptions to the economy that their
<br>
analysis did not consider.  And this could result in social preferences
<br>
being less satisfied than under the status quo.
<br>
<p>The burden of proof ought to be on those who propose policy changes
<br>
to show that they will achieve their goal.  Just because people in the
<br>
future might wish they had saved more in the past, that doesn't imply that
<br>
making people save more in the past will automatically satisfy more of
<br>
the preferences of people in the future.  It's like my earlier analogy:
<br>
people would prefer to pay less for gasoline, but lowering gasoline
<br>
prices will not automatically make their preferences be better satisfied.
