<em>&gt; &gt; ...Many anti-enhancement people base their position on their

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the person. What would a transhumanist defence of such enhancements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be in terms of our views of personal integrity and human dignity? And
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would defend enhancements of whatever kind on the grounds that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase personal integrity and expand human dignity. Because that's what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhancements do. They make things better, more beautiful, more free, more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excellent, healthier, more competent. Anyone who would argue against such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things simply and plainly does not understand the meaning of the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;enhancement.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reasonable people would not allow modifications or bio-engineering which

</em><br>
<p>A bit of devil's advocate, so we can more fully understand (and thus
<br>
better rebut) the opposition:
<br>
<p>When I try the above argument, the usual reply is that my statement
<br>
(that enhancements really are enhancements) are met with vague,
<br>
unformed responses that boil down to calling me a liar.  As near as I
<br>
can tell, they are worried that, no matter what potential is promised,
<br>
what will be/is being/has been sold as &quot;enhancements&quot; always turns out
<br>
to be snake oil, i.e. it profits the seller and is either benign or
<br>
actually harmful to the buyer.  The justification derives from past
<br>
enhancements like &quot;mystical&quot; potions and steroids (which get more
<br>
press, at least these days, than enhancements that actually do work -
<br>
for instance, keeping clean, better medicines, et cetera - which tend
<br>
to fade into the backdrop of accepted everyday life until they are no
<br>
longer &quot;enhancements&quot;).
