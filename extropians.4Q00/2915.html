Thanks to everyone for commenting on this question. Apparently whether
<br>
marriage is extropic or not depends on how we define marriage, how we
<br>
experience it individually, and ultimately, how we get on with our
<br>
marriage partners. Some of us may be married to technological singularity,
<br>
and some may have wed a cryonic community. In any event, undertaking
<br>
marriage vows while functioning as a biological carbon unit has not lost
<br>
its allure for now, but it may do so for posthumans (we can't know with
<br>
presently available data). Also (for now) marriage tends to lend social
<br>
credence and respectability to any movement.

<br>
<p>How many of us would leave our spouses for the chance to merge with an SI
<br>
or to upload to a more complex adaptive sentient system, we can't tell
<br>
until the real opportunity presents itself. Then again, marriage may have
<br>
nothing to do with extropy at all. It's just a matter of individual taste.
<br>
I mean, is the color heliotrope extropic? Not in itself obviously, and
<br>
neither is marriage (in itself) extropic. Will Mind Children mind if their
<br>
parents aren't married? Probably not, but Hans Moravec is married for
<br>
other reasons we presume.
<br>
<p>If marriage has extropic qualities in and of itself, then that makes
<br>
extropians rather conservative vis a vis the social engineering of the
<br>
last several decades in Western civilization. No problem. Scientists as a
<br>
group are perhaps one of the most conservative populations of all. &quot;Change
<br>
the environment. Don't change man,&quot; Buckminster Fuller is quoted as saying
<br>
somewhere.
<br>
(For good reason: If we change ourselves, we may destroy our ability to
<br>
change back again [the Dr. Jekyll/ Mr. Hyde problem] but if we keep
<br>
ourselves intact, there's always the possibility that we can restore a
<br>
damaged environment.)
<br>
<p>Internet associations may make it easier for compatible couples to find
<br>
each other, or the Net may make marriage seem less interesting and
<br>
relevant to the digerati. We won't know until the Digital Generation
<br>
answers this question for itself.
<br>
<p>Damien Broderick quoted:
<br>
&quot;Antisthenes rejoined: If that is your conclusion, Socrates, why do you
<br>
not
<br>
tutor your own wife,
<br>
Xanthippe, one of the most difficult women of times past, present, or
<br>
future?&quot;
<br>
<p>Perhaps Socrates did not tutor his own wife, Xanthippe, because &quot;Once made
<br>
equal to man, woman soon becomes his superior,&quot; as he is occasionally
<br>
cited as saying. (That statement may have another meaning as well:
<br>
defective psyches sometimes become dictatorial and overbearing -- like
<br>
Xanthippe -- so don't give them the chance by granting them equality.)
<br>
<p>Max M. W. Rasmussen wrote,
<br>
&quot;Until we can change our genes, marriage in one name or another will be
<br>
here
<br>
to stay.&quot;
<br>
<p>I find that the most compelling perspective in this discussion. When
<br>
transitional humans transcend biology, their views of inter-personal
<br>
relationships will, it seems to me, have to undergo radical change. The
<br>
ultra-extropic step of leaving (carbon-based) biology behind cannot fail
<br>
to also leave the memetics of intimate relationship behind as well.
<br>
<p>Michael Lorrey wrote,
<br>
&quot;Marriage laws in most states are essentially permitting two illiterates
<br>
to incorporate as a partnership without any business experience or
<br>
training, no assets, and allows them to assume major 18 year debts
<br>
(children) every nine months with no credit record or proof of ability to
<br>
pay, and the ability to declare bankruptcy on those debts while retaining
<br>
ownership of the assets. If that's not a recipe for disaster, I don't know
<br>
what is.&quot;
<br>
<p>In light of this analysis, I'd have to conclude that marriage doesn't seem
<br>
extropic, not even a little bit. But some people can make a bad idea work
<br>
very well all their lives. That says more about the adaptability and
<br>
resourcefulness of people than it says about marriage. The saddest thing
<br>
about marriage is that it too often persuades two losers to combine their
<br>
misery into one agonizing self-defeat.
<br>
<p>Not everyone agrees that marriage is based on biology of course. See for
<br>
example:

<br>
&quot; ...the kind of official marriage that existed during the times of the
<br>
Old Testament isn't around anymore. ... Back then - and for centuries
<br>
after - marriage wasn't designed to be a loving and lifelong union between
<br>
a man and a woman; it was designed to be a productive and lifelong
<br>
contract between a father or brother and a husband for ownership of a
<br>
female.&quot;
<br>
Apparently the modern version of marriage has been around for just a few
<br>
hundred years.
<br>
<p>At any rate, I think we can all agree that a copious amount of money would
<br>
afford one more opportunity to pursue the benefits of extropic activities.
<br>
Hence, if you know of an extremely wealthy individual who would like to
<br>
discuss marriage, please forward information to me privately.
