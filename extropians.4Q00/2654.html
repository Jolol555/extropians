<em>&gt; Hazarded a guess, did you?  Good.  In my language, we call that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief, and it is true by definition (in my language) that you believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to be true.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.  You had me there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;From now on, whenever somebody says the word &quot;objectivity,&quot; you and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will pretend they're saying &quot;solidarity.&quot;  Whenever somebody says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;absolute truth,&quot; we'll pretend they're saying &quot;beliefs we share.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Share your beliefs.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, point taken.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In an earlier post on relativism, I presented you with two arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against relativism.  One of them was traditional.  The other was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newer Wittgensteinian argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did those arguments make sense to you?  What's wrong with them on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms?
</em><br>
<p>I may have glossed over them.  Anyway, Wittgenstein is frequently used to
<br>
uphold relativism, especially by Feyerabend.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Or are you too self-absorbed to read even the most famous philosophers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nearest to your own beliefs?  Have you got it all figured out?  That's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no relativism.  That's ethnocentrism, like I was suggesting.  [I KNEW
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'd come around! ;)]  But where's the open-mindedness?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I've read Nietzsche.  I've read Thus Spoke Zarathustra three times.
<br>
I'm a Nietzsche addict.  I've never gotten around to Sartre (I will sooner
<br>
or later), and I tackled Kant's Critique of Pure Reason a few years ago,
<br>
only to give it up after getting hopelessly confused 80 pages into the text
<br>
(he's on the list for Ethics next semester, however, so I'll be returning to
<br>
him soon enough).
<br>
<p>Okay, I'm not a relativist.  Relativism is a game that I play with e-lists
<br>
made up of members that support a given ideology.  Heck, last night on a
<br>
Neopagan Druid mailing list I was arguing hotly for an
<br>
objectivist-libertarian stance that supported gun rights and environmental
<br>
pollution- and this list is made up of some of the Greenest of the Greens!
<br>
I've debated in favor of physicalism and determinism on the Temple of Set (a
<br>
Satanic religious group which believes in the supremacy of the will and that
<br>
everyone can potentially become master of the universe) e-list, and I've
<br>
tried to push asceticism and abstinence on a TOPY list (The TOPY is a group
<br>
of hedonist-anarchist punks who practice magick and promote excessive drug
<br>
use and promiscuity).  The Extropians have been the first list to actually
<br>
put up a decent argument! (Well, with the exception of Michael Aquino of the
<br>
Temple of Set... of course, that guy is scary.  He managed to use Thomas
<br>
Aquinas as proof for the existence of the devil and the non-existence of
<br>
God, and wrote a series of proofs that would make the neo-Thomist professors
<br>
here at my university convert to Setianism if they saw them.  They got me to
<br>
join their church- for three months, before I was kicked out.)
<br>
<p>You want my belief?  Here are two quotes that sum up my way of thinking
<br>
pretty well (the first from Zarathustra, the second from Hesse's &quot;Demian&quot;):
<br>
<p>&quot;A day shall come when you shall see your high things no more, and your low
<br>
things all too near, and you will fear your exaltation as if it were a
<br>
phantom.  In that day you will cry: All is false!&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;An enlightened man had but one duty- to seek the way to himself, to reach
<br>
inner certainty, to grope his way forward, no matter where it led.  I had
<br>
often speculated with images of the future, dreamed of roles that might be
<br>
assigned, perhaps as poet, or prophet, or painter, or something similar.
<br>
All that was futile.  I did not exist to write poems, to preach or to paint,
<br>
neither I nor anyone else.  All of that was incidental.  Each man had only
<br>
one genuine vocation- to find the way to himself.  He might end up as poet
<br>
or madman, as prophet or criminal- that was not his affair, ultimately it
<br>
was of no concern.  His task was to discover his own destiny- not an
<br>
arbitrary one- and live it out wholly and resolutely within himself.&quot;
<br>
<p>My belief is very existential- frankly, do what you love, and do what thou
<br>
wilt.  In the end, we're all headed to the same place- so we should all try
<br>
to discover which side we are on, which faction we are in.  There is truth-
<br>
but it cannot be known for certain.  I think that there is a pretty good
<br>
chance that in the end, truth is defined by the state of the individual's
<br>
existence, and all we can do is play this beautiful game.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To revolt is to take our beliefs into our own hands.  Relativism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking everyone else's beliefs at face value.  But the real revolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is in holding beliefs of our own, by ourselves, and rejecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; false beliefs of others.  We stand up for ourselves.  Now, dust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself off and let's get on with it.
</em><br>
<p>Well, in that case, what makes your beliefs true?  First off, I know nothing
<br>
about you, and little about your beliefs.  You could believe that I am a
<br>
purple elephant with a telepathic internet connection who has falsified all
<br>
the data that I have given about myself, but it would not make it true.
<br>
Yet, you could stand for and defend this belief, and even try to force me to
<br>
accept it as true.
<br>
<p>So, in other words, I'm going to reject your false beliefs- and uphold my
<br>
true beliefs.  That's what it comes down to, doesn't it? ;)
