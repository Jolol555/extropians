<p><em>&gt; By the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  who makes those GTGs anyway.....
</em><br>
<p>There are two kinds of GTGs: &quot;Aero-derivatives&quot; and &quot;industrial&quot;.  A GTG is 
<br>
basically a jet engine bolted to the ground, with a dynamo hooked up to its 
<br>
central shaft.  A &quot;combined cycle&quot; plant also uses the waste heat of the 
<br>
turbine to make steam that generates electricity in a secondary cycle.  
<br>
Aero-derivatives are literally jet engines that have been de-tuned to run on 
<br>
natural gas.  Industrial GTGs are designed from the ground up for stationary 
<br>
generation.  In either case, the leading manufacturers are the same as the 
<br>
ones who make the turbines that push jet planes: GE, Westinghouse and Rolls 
<br>
Royce.
<br>
<p>(BTW, GTGs burn MUCH cleaner than coal plants.)
<br>
<p>People are building &quot;merchant plants&quot; so fast and furious right now that you 
<br>
will have to wait TWO YEARS for a new GTG if you get in line right now.  
<br>
People are selling their place in those lines for these machines for a nice 
<br>
premium these days.
<br>
<p>The truly cool thing about this technology is how modular it is.  I've been 
<br>
involved in the industry for going on 15 years now and I've seen these plants 
<br>
evolve from one-off custom designs to what amounts to &quot;plug-and-play&quot; 
<br>
construction.  You can slap one together in SIX MONTHS (I've seen it done) 
<br>
from &quot;green field&quot; to cranking out &quot;golf-ball-size electrons&quot; (as one of my 
<br>
friends puts it).  Compare this to the achingly slow way that giant 
<br>
coal-fired plants (and worse, big nuke plants) have traditionally been built 
<br>
by monopoly utilities, with their huge capital outlays locked up for years, 
<br>
and the trend in power generation is a no-brainer to figure out.  
<br>
<p>Beyond this, the new breed of energy merchants like Dynegy (am I proud of 
<br>
them or what?) are in the process of completely revolutionizing the whole 
<br>
*culture* of energy production in the world.  They're completely undermining 
<br>
the old, slow, heavily regulated monopoly utility way of doing business and, 
<br>
in the process, have laid the groundwork for a new way of looking at the 
<br>
over-all energy grid and market so that ANY new energy sources can be plugged 
<br>
in at ANY level. Thus, as new, smaller-scale generation nodes become 
<br>
technologically feasible (think home- and neighborhood-scale fuel cell and 
<br>
solar plants), the &quot;grid&quot; (in the broadest sense, including not just the 
<br>
physical infrastructure, but also the market network) can accommodate them.  
<br>
This was unthinkable just ten years ago.
