<p>
<em>&gt; Love is not limited to reproduction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Love's only purpose is to serve itself.
</em><br>
<p>Love = The desire for higher organization and higher complexity
<br>
<p>Love, whether it is directed towards another person, towards an art form,
<br>
towards a study, towards one's self, or towards the universe, is what drives
<br>
entities to create- in essence, love is a very extropian principle.  Even if
<br>
marriage is a dying institution, love isn't leaving- love will continue to
<br>
drive humanity and the cosmos onward to it's final destination, wherever
<br>
that may be.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Now we're entering the domain of poets.....
</em><br>
<p>And what a sweet domain it is.
<br>
<p>-Nicq MacDonald
<br>
<p>&quot;We do progress, but how?  Not by the tinkering of the meliorist; not by the
<br>
crushing of initiative; not by laws and regulations which hamstring the
<br>
racehorse, and handcuff the boxer; but by the innovations of the eccentric,
<br>
by the phantasies of the hashish-dreamer of philosophy, by the aspirations
<br>
of the idealist to the impossible, by the imagination of the revolutionary,
<br>
by the perilous adventure of the pioneer.  Progress is by leaps and bounds,
<br>
by breaking from custom, by working on untried experiments; in short, by the
<br>
follies and crimes of men of genius, only recognizable as wisdom and virtue
<br>
after they have been tortured to death, and their murderers reap gloatingly
<br>
the harvest of the seeds they sowed at midnight.&quot; -Aleister Crowley, &quot;On
<br>
Original Sin&quot;
