<p>My mother has been a computer enthusiast for the last 30 years.
<br>
She bought a PDP-11 back in the late 70s and has watched the
<br>
technology develop over the years.  A few weeks ago she replaced
<br>
her desktop machine with a 1 GHz model P3 and loves it.
<br>
<p>Now of course, the poor woman is deeply deluded and seriously
<br>
misguided, because she thinks microsloth makes wonderful products,
<br>
but compared to what she had to work with in the 70s, I suppose
<br>
it is.
<br>
<p>Interesting point: I was able to convince her to do cryonics, but
<br>
she went along only because I wanted her to: she didnt put a
<br>
penny of stock in it.  But in the last couple years the idea has
<br>
grown on her.  She did a simple linear extrapolation on the
<br>
computer power and realized there is a damn good chance
<br>
that uploading will eventually be practical, but probably not
<br>
in her natural lifetime.  Heres the part that I am very proud of
<br>
my mother: she realized that her religious notions might be all
<br>
wrong, and that cryonics and religion together allow one to
<br>
cover both bases so to speak.  The transhumanist notions
<br>
come pretty naturally, after one begins to extrapolate technology
<br>
into the future, eh?  spike
