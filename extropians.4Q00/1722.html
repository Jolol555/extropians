death ray today, if we only had the will!

tried to build one, etc.

<p>Hi Alex,  
<br>
<p>Telsa's power plant in Telluride, Colorado was the central backdrop for
<br>
some of our &quot;power&quot;ful events and exhibitions
<br>
(<a href="http://shell.rmi.net/~pspencer/power.html">http://shell.rmi.net/~pspencer/power.html</a>)  but his SFdeath ray gun did
<br>
attract the government's attention for other reasons.  A brief summary at
<br>
<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bcash/tesla.htm">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bcash/tesla.htm</a> is a wee bit informative.
<br>
<p>&quot;We do not know if Tesla ever actually invented a death ray.  There are
<br>
conspiracy theories that the U.S. government tried to develop a death ray
<br>
after the inventor's death by confiscating his notes.  But that is all
<br>
unknown what we can best do is look at what we have of his notes and
<br>
experiments and then decide how close he came.  There are hints that he was
<br>
working on a high-potential direct-current system for generating and
<br>
transmitting electricity for long distances.  Direct current can be
<br>
transmitted better than alternating current over long distances but there
<br>
is no way of generating direct current at high voltages.  There is no
<br>
indication that Tesla overcame this problem.&quot;  Matthew McCleer Cash
