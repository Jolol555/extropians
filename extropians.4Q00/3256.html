</em><br>
<p>The earth's having four corners is just one of many scientific errors 
<br>
in the &quot;good&quot; book that Biblical literalists tend to ignore.
<br>
<p>A quick look at the Biblical Errancy web site mentions a whole slew 
<br>
of them (for the curious) &lt;<a href="http://members.aol.com/ckbloomfld/">http://members.aol.com/ckbloomfld/</a>&gt;.  The 
<br>
four corners is item &quot;o&quot;.
<br>
<p>(a) the bat is a bird (Lev. 11:19, Deut. 14:11, 18);
<br>
(b) Some fowls are four-footed (Lev. 11:20-21);
<br>
(c) Some creeping insects have four legs. (Lev. 11:22-23);
<br>
(d) Hares chew the cud (Lev. 11:6);
<br>
(e) Conies chew the cud (Lev. 11:5);
<br>
(f) Camels don't divide the hoof (Lev. 11:4);
<br>
(g) The earth was formed out of and by means of water (2 Peter 3:5 RSV);
<br>
(h) The earth rest on pillars (1 Sam. 2:8);
<br>
(i) The earth won't be moved (1Chron. 16:30);
<br>
(j) A hare does not divide the hoof (Deut. 14:7);
<br>
(k) The rainbow is not as old as rain and sunshine (Gen. 9:13);
<br>
(l) A mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds and grows into the 
<br>
greatest of all shrubs (Matt. 13:31-32 RSV);
<br>
(m) Turtles have voices (Song of Sol. 2:12);
<br>
(n) The earth has ends or edges (Job 37:3);
<br>
(o) The earth has four corners (Isa. 11:12, Rev. 7:1);
<br>
(p) Some 4-legged animals fly (Lev. 11:21);
<br>
(q) The world's language didn't evolve but appeared suddenly (Gen. 11:6-9; and
<br>
(r) A fetus can understand speech (Luke 1:44).
