Slashdot reports that Iain M. Banks has a new novel, Look
<br>
to Windward, set in his pan-galactic Culture.
<br>
<a href="http://slashdot.org/books/00/10/24/0445204.shtml">http://slashdot.org/books/00/10/24/0445204.shtml</a>.  The book is only
<br>
available in England at the moment.
<br>
<p>An excerpt is available at
<br>
<a href="http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,357311,00.html">http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,357311,00.html</a>.
<br>
The Slashdot reviewer describes this as being less of an action novel
<br>
than most of the Culture stories.
<br>
<p>A couple of strange things I've noticed about the Culture.  First, most
<br>
Culture members are human-like, although not from Earth.  This is kind
<br>
of like Star Trek, where many planets have evolved similar human-like
<br>
species.  Inter-planetary sexual reproduction is even possible.  This
<br>
is highly unlikely but it does make for more story possibilities.
<br>
<p>Second, most of the stories seem to take place roughly in the present
<br>
day.  Consider Phlebas took place around our year 1300.  The new book
<br>
is some hundreds of years later.  And the Culture does not seem to be
<br>
a fully mature technological civilization; they still have &quot;progress&quot;:
<br>
drones and ships hundreds of years old are not as advanced as newer
<br>
ones.  So we have a curious coincidence in time as well as in physical
<br>
appearance; the Culture has appeared at very roughly the same time as
<br>
our own technological civilization.  This is also like Star Trek, where
<br>
all the various humanoid races are developing space technology at about
<br>
the same time.
<br>
<p>I suppose you can explain both of these by postulating that humans did
<br>
not evolve here on earth, we were seeded here, perhaps just a few hundred
<br>
thousand years ago, and the same thing was done at the same time on a
<br>
bunch of other planets.  I don't know how you explain about monkey DNA
<br>
though.  Maybe humans weren't seeded, but they were genetically engineered
<br>
on each planet from that native species that most closely resembled the
<br>
humanoid ideal of the engineers, so that each planet developed fully
<br>
native humanoids who would nevertheless be very similar to each other.
