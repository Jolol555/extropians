<em>&gt;does NOT hold for Florida - I live here, have been to the shows, and

</em><br>
<p>Never heard of the &quot;Turner Diaries&quot; Tales of Ted and Jane - or something 
<br>
more like &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; (is that right?)? More 
<br>
info, please.
<br>
<p>I would not term the tables of guns &quot;strewn&quot; as revolting, unless the guns 
<br>
were damaged in the &quot;strewing&quot;. Persons who don't respect good machinery 
<br>
should not have it.
<br>
<p>If Florida does not have waiting periods, then if you care about this, try 
<br>
to get it changed at the state level. This is not something the feds should 
<br>
be involved in. By present federal law, the background checks are required 
<br>
of all dealer sales, still.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yeah, let's arm ALL the teachers, and if a metal detector shows that they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;DON'T have weapons, they should be issued at the schoolhouse door - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;NOT.  Let's keep the guns out of the hands of the kids, instead, through 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gun show background checks.
</em><br>
<p>Ever hear of the &quot;war on drugs&quot;? If kids can get heroin, they can get guns. 
<br>
Shut down the gun shows, and you just take away the rights of the many who 
<br>
don't shoot up schools to ATTEMPT to stop the minuscule number of creeps 
<br>
who do.
<br>
<p>Again and again - exactly how are any kinds of gun laws aside from a 
<br>
complete confiscation of all weapons, done by an inch - by - inch search of 
<br>
the entire continent, followed by a hermetic sealing of the borders, going 
<br>
to prevent a determined nutcase from getting a weapon on the black market 
<br>
that exists now and will grow uncontrollably as soon as the confiscation is 
<br>
announced? Guns are simple machines. They can be made in a garage in a few 
<br>
hours, along with ammo, if that is what you need to do. You will succeed in 
<br>
making guns hard to get for good, stable people, and make lots of money for 
<br>
smugglers.
<br>
<p>It's not necessary for every school staff member to be armed and ready for 
<br>
a fire fight, let alone openly carrying. I would not expect anyone to carry 
<br>
a firearm unless they were proficient in its' use and mentally and 
<br>
emotionally prepared to use it when necessary. The simple knowledge that 
<br>
some staff MIGHT be armed is sufficient to prevent many crimes. The 
<br>
suicidal person who would still attempt an atrocity will always be with us 
<br>
- but at least there would be a chance that someone with a weapon and the 
<br>
skill to use it in a crunch would be on hand when the disturbed person appears.
<br>
<p>The actual figures on &quot;mass&quot; killings are very low, but highly publicized. 
<br>
There are a few unpublicized instances of an armed individual stopping or 
<br>
preventing a Columbine style massacre. They are unpublicized because they 
<br>
do not fit with the media's demonization of firearms. When I find my 
<br>
references, I will send them to you direct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Most likely it is an NRA disinformation urban legend, or it was the kids 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves hyping their impending spree - that is, unless you believed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that government operatives showed them 52 Red Queens.
</em><br>
<p>The warning call supposedly came in on a line that was reserved for 
<br>
official use - not one that could be easily dialed in on by anyone.
<br>
I don't recognize the reference to &quot;Queens&quot;.
