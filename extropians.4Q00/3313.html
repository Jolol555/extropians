<em>&gt; I view Brin as the opposite of an enemy.  Brin is IMHO what we

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I agree with part of this.  David Brin does seem to be reasonably smart,
<br>
thoughtful and articulate (although to be honest I find most of his
<br>
published argumentation to be weak).  I don't know whether he is truly
<br>
eager for criticism; it's not clear to me that any of his positions
<br>
have changed as a result of the considerable criticism he has received.
<br>
Look at his response John Clark quoted here on December 16, 1996:
<br>
<p><em>        &gt;Utter sophistry! [...] philosophical arm-wavings [...]                  
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;paranoid little boys [...] drivel [...] liars [...]                 
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;secrecy-fetishists  [...] I don't give  a flying %^&amp;$%^ [...]                  
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;profound naivete [...] ignorance [...] SHUT UP!
</em><br>
<p>John's exchange with David, which grew increasingly harsh and sarcastic
<br>
on both sides, was obviously unwelcome criticism.
<br>
<p>He does take the issues seriously, which is more than you can say for
<br>
most people.  As for consequentialism, I think he has boiled it down
<br>
to a caricature of blind ideology opposing reasoned pragmatism.  I view
<br>
ideology as reliance on deeply rooted principles to provide a heuristic
<br>
guide with long-term value on complex issues.
<br>
<p>My problems with David Brin include his lack of fairness and objectivity,
<br>
and his tendency towards polemics and mischaracterizing his opponents.
<br>
Look at this interview by CNN, which he links to from his site at
<br>
www.kithrup.com/brin.  From
<br>
<a href="http://cnnfn.cnn.com/2000/03/10/electronic/q_brin_intv/">http://cnnfn.cnn.com/2000/03/10/electronic/q_brin_intv/</a>, the first
<br>
question:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. As you survey the privacy landscape today, how do you feel about
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what you see?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. I get irked when I see a premature coalescence around an unsupported
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cliche, like the one pushed by both wings of the strong privacy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;movement -- that our freedom, security, and safety will be enhanced by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preventing other people from knowing things. At root it's a despotic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rather mean-minded approach. It's been tried by tyrants, kings,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and priests, but it's not how we achieved the most successful human
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;civilization in history. The trick we use, instead, is making sure
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one can escape accountability.
<br>
<p>Right there we see him demonizing the opposition, claiming that support
<br>
of privacy is a &quot;despotic and rather mean-minded approach&quot;.  This is
<br>
not only a harsh and unjustified criticism, it borders on the absurd.
<br>
Privacy supporters as despots?  The &quot;Strong Privacy&quot; cypherpunk position
<br>
(which is what he implied he was most opposed to, in a message here also
<br>
on December 16) is not based on forcing anyone to do anything.  They only
<br>
want to be allowed to run their software and work on their technology.
<br>
It's the opposite of despotism.
<br>
<p>I am worried by someone who combines an absence of rhetorical fairness
<br>
with a position that implies restrictions on access to privacy technology.
<br>
The one saving grace, to be honest, is that I find him so (excuse the
<br>
word) transparent and unpersuasive that I hope that in the end he won't
<br>
have much influence.
<br>
