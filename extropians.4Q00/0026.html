<em>&gt; Friendly is not observer-invariant, goddamit. If you want to impose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your particular concept on the rest of us via (thankfully
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer-Friendly, or something.
</em><br>
<p>I brought this same point up towards the beginning of this thread,
<br>
addressed specifically to Eliezer, and there was no response.
<br>
<p>Two days ago I posted a URL for a recent paper by a couple of people who
<br>
are currently working in the AI field--&quot;Cooperative Coevolution: An
<br>
Architecture for Evolving Coadapted Subcomponents&quot;  by Mitchell A. Potter
<br>
(Navy Center for Applied Research in Artificial Intelligence)  and
<br>
Kenneth A. DeJong (Computer Science Dept. George Mason University). 
<br>
Published in *Evolutionary Computation* 8(1) (2000) 
<br>
<p>Again there was no response.  As an outsider to the AI field, I would
<br>
nevertheless like to have a better understanding of it.  Has anyone else
<br>
read Potter's and DeJong's paper?  
<br>
<p><p>Some questions I have include:  
<br>
<p>1. What difference would cooperative coevolution make with respect to the
<br>
relationship between humans and highly evolved AI?  
<br>
<p>2.  Are the capabilities of AI severely limited in the absence of
<br>
algorithms for cooperative coevolution?
<br>
<p>3.   Potter's and DeJong's  EA's call for destroying unsuccessful
<br>
&quot;species&quot; and maintaining &quot;genetic&quot; diversity by introducing new species
<br>
whenever stagnation is detected in the system.  Stagnation is detected by
<br>
monitoring the quality of interspeices collaborations via checking each
<br>
collaboration for the improvement it provides in the functioning of the
<br>
&quot;ecosystem&quot; as a whole.  Is this methodology  troubling with respect to
<br>
possible future interaction between humans and AI?  Why or why not?  What
<br>
are some other methods of maintaining diversity?
<br>
<p>4.  Do the &quot;species&quot; in this research correspond more closely to
<br>
biological genes or to biological species?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  And, of course, it is clearly obvious what is best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mirroring reality and what not, without being given a chance of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluated by reality, since that wouldn't truncate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular-metric-Unfriendly behaviour space region.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I see now!  This makes it all perfectly clear.
<br>
