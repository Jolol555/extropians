<p>Well yes of course you can't literally change the past, any more than you
<br>
can literally change the future.  If you learn something about the way the
<br>
future will be, via a time machine or something else, then you are stuck
<br>
with that being the way the future will be no matter what you do.
<br>
<p>And yet it does make sense to talk about choosing aspects of the future,
<br>
in situations where you don't know how the future will be and those
<br>
future events are casually connected to actions you will not take.
<br>
In exactly the same way in can make sense to talk about choosing aspects
<br>
of the past via a time machine.
<br>
<p>You don't remember every dollar you spent on every day of your life.
<br>
So there is no paradox with your considering to use a time machine to
<br>
give your ten year ago self one more cookie, or one more sip of soda, etc.
