<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Oldest age at death on the increase
<br>
<p>In the journal Science's September 29 issue, it was reported that the age
<br>
at which the longest lived people die is steadily on the rise.
<br>
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, analyzed statistics
<br>
from the years 1861 through 1999 for Sweden, which has a history of a lack
<br>
of misreporting this information and was therefore determined the most
<br>
reliable source of records.  The researchers noted that the results of the
<br>
analysis should apply to the populations of other industrialized countries
<br>
as well.
<br>
<p>The oldest lived person in Sweden in 1861 was reported to be 101 at the
<br>
time of death.  In 1999, the oldest age at death had risen to 108.  The
<br>
researchers sought to determine if the rise has occurred because of the
<br>
increase in the size of the populations studied which would provide a
<br>
statistically greater chance of longer lived people, but this was not the
<br>
case.  The rise in maximum age at death in Sweden from the 1861 to the
<br>
1990s  was mainly attributable to the reduction in death rates of people
<br>
over seventy, while only 12% of the increase was due to the growth of the
<br>
groups(organized by year of birth) studied.  Results for men and women
<br>
were almost identical.  The trend toward older maximum death ages in
<br>
wealthier nations began to accelerate upward in 1970 and will most likely
<br>
continue.
<br>
<p>The authors of the report conclude with the following optimistic
<br>
statements: &quot;Although the maximum has increased much more slowly than the
<br>
average, the entire distribution of ages at death has been shifting upward
<br>
for more than a century in Sweden and, presumably, in other countries as
<br>
well. Reductions in death rates at older ages, which have accelerated in
<br>
recent decades, seem likely to continue and may gradually extend the
<br>
limits of achieved human longevity even further.&quot; (Science Vol 289, No
<br>
5488)
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Prevention
<br>
<p>The concept of taking actions now to maintain youthful health is based on
<br>
published scientific studies showing that the diseases of aging may be
<br>
prevented, or can at least be postponed.
<br>
<p>People who want to reduce their risk of disease are often overwhelmed by
<br>
the volume of technical data on the subject. The Life Extension Foundation
<br>
has reviewed more than sixty-four years' worth of published medical
<br>
literature, and Foundation personnel have spent more than thirty-five
<br>
years working with physicians and scientists in the antiaging field.
<br>
<p>Before you embark on a program to reduce your risk of degenerative
<br>
disease, it is important for you to know about scientific studies
<br>
conducted on humans that show these therapies really work. If you are not
<br>
aware of these published studies, you may be unlikely to methodically
<br>
follow a long-term disease prevention program.
<br>
<p>If you are healthy now, and want to stay that way, the Life Extension
<br>
Foundation has designed protocols that incorporate the best-documented
<br>
disease-preventing nutrients and hormones.
<br>
<p>The Foundation's Prevention protocols consists of the 11 most important
<br>
supplements for the average person to take every day to reduce risk of
<br>
contracting the degenerative diseases of aging.
<br>
<p>Remember, the Prevention protocol is for healthy people. Those seeking to
<br>
treat an existing disease can refer to the many specific disease
<br>
prevention protocols contained in this book.
<br>
<p>The following recommendations are listed in order of importance:
<br>
Recommendation 1: Life Extension Mix
<br>
Recommendation 2: Life Extension Booster
<br>
Recommendation 3: Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)
<br>
Recommendation 4: Restoring Youthful Hormone Balance
<br>
Recommendation 5: Trimethylglycine (TMG)
<br>
Recommendation 6: Cognitex and Ginkgo
<br>
Recommendation 7: For Men: Saw Palmetto / Nettle Extract,
<br>
For Women: Bone Assure
<br>
Recommendation 8: Melatonin
<br>
Recommendation 9: Life Extension Herbal Mix
<br>
Recommendation 10: Mega Soy Extract
<br>
Recommendation 11: Aspirin (Healthprin)
<br>
<p>(Please observe the appropriate precautions pertaining to the above
<br>
nutrients.)

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
Life Extension Mix
<br>
<p>Since 1983, Life Extension Mix has been reformulated fourteen times to
<br>
reflect new scientific findings about preventing disease and slowing
<br>
premature aging. Foundation members use Life Extension Mix as the
<br>
cornerstone of an overall program to maintain an optimal state of health.
<br>
The 67 ingredients contained in Life Extension Mix provide broad-spectrum
<br>
protection against the molecular mechanisms involved in degenerative
<br>
disease and aging. What makes Life Extension Mix so different from other
<br>
multinutrient formulas is that it:
<br>
1. Provides the optimal dose for most nutrients
<br>
2. Provides the most bioavailable form of each nutrient
<br>
3. Contains pharmaceutical-grade nutrients
<br>
<p>Life Extension Mix is an antioxidant formula that affords a considerable
<br>
degree of protection against free radicals. In addition, Life Extension
<br>
Mix includes nutrients that: enhance methylation (an essential process
<br>
that declines during aging); inhibit glycosylation (a significant cause of
<br>
aging damage); suppress apolipoprotein serum levels (a cause of
<br>
atherosclerosis); suppress homocysteine serum levels (a cause of
<br>
cardiovascular disease); suppress mitochondrial oxidative stress (a cause
<br>
of premature aging); protect against thrombosis (abnormal blood clotting
<br>
inside arteries); maintain microcapillary perfusion; and protect against
<br>
DNA mutations that lead to certain cancers.

<p><p>Life Extension Booster
<br>
<p>Life Extension Booster provides a &quot;boost&quot; in potency to Life Extension
<br>
Mix.  Members of the Life Extension Foundation learned of the importance
<br>
of the gamma form of vitamin E in 1997. Since then Gamma E Tocopherol has
<br>
become a popular supplement. Each softgel of the Life Extension Booster
<br>
now equals one capsule of Gamma E Tocopherol, so those taking the Booster
<br>
no longer need to take Gamma E tocopherol. The Booster provides:
<br>
<p>Selenium - Selenium is one of the most important nutrients to supplement
<br>
with, and each softgel of Life Extension Booster equals one capsule of
<br>
Super Selenium Complex, thus reducing the need to take supplemental
<br>
selenium.
<br>
<p>Carotenoids - The carotenoids lycopene, lutein and alpha carotene are
<br>
becoming popular, and the Life Extension Booster contains more lycopene
<br>
along with natural beta-carotene, alpha carotene and a potent dose of
<br>
lutein.
<br>
<p>Grape-seed extract - The Booster contains Masquelier OPC Gold extract, the
<br>
undisputed Cadillac brand of all grape-seed extracts, along with the
<br>
BioVin Full Spectrum Grape Seed-Skin extract. These two extracts provide
<br>
potent doses of the proanthocyanidins.the strongest natural antioxidants.
<br>
<p>Folate and B12 - As in most multinutrient formulas formulated by The Life
<br>
Extension Foundation, the maximum allowable limit of folic acid, along
<br>
with vitamin B12 is included to facilitate youthful remethylation
<br>
throughout the body (and lower toxic serum homocysteine levels).
<br>
<p>Ginkgo, plus - The Booster also contains a small amount of
<br>
pharmaceutical-grade ginkgo extract and Roche brand ascorbyl palmitate and
<br>
calcium ascorbate.
