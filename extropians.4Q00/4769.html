<p>Hey Doug, Im glad you weighed in on this one.  Every time I look
<br>
at the Osprey I think how cool it would be if that concept could
<br>
be made to work.  Since you are aerodynamics cluey, help me
<br>
out here.  It always looked to me like if the pilot rotates the props
<br>
to horizontal with too much forward speed they would lose lift
<br>
the craft could go auger helplessly into the ground with both
<br>
engines screaming.  Wouldn't ya have flow separations all over
<br>
the place?  So then there would be a craft that could only be
<br>
operated safely by computer, eh?
<br>
<p>There was a scene in Contact which was set about 10 yrs
<br>
future where they had a tilt-turbine VTOL craft.  That was
<br>
pretty wicked cool too.
<br>
<p>I thought of a maneuver that might make it safer to land, altho
<br>
it might not be so comfortable to the passengers:  as the pilot
<br>
approaches the landing, she would pull it up vertical and hold
<br>
it until the upward velocity reached zero, with the nose straight
<br>
up.  Then keeping the props horizontal, the pilot rotates the
<br>
fuselage to horizontal, and gradually settles to the deck, thereby
<br>
avoiding the risk of what has evidently crunched two ospreys:
<br>
lost lift because of rotating with too much forward velocity.
<br>
<p>Wouldnt that work?  spike
