<br>
<p>My fascination with libertarianism stems from its viral,
<br>
self-perpetuating, scalable, *unpreventable* nature. It's unspoken (up
<br>
till now) assumption that &quot;if something can possibly go wrong, it will,
<br>
so let's incorporate it into our design&quot;.
<br>
<p>If the public is not morally ready and willing for a libertarian
<br>
revolution, either libertarianism is self-contradictory, or we've made
<br>
an unwarranted assumption in travelling from the theory to the practice
<br>
of libertarianism. An unwarranted assumption such as the following, for
<br>
example:
<br>
<p>In concluding that libertarianism needs a populace that understands and
<br>
appreciates its merits, we're overlooking the other way anything gets
<br>
done-- because nobody can prevent it. Because the winds of entropy are
<br>
at just the right angle to the sails. For instance, nobody, not even
<br>
those who pollute, think that pollution is actually a *good* thing in
<br>
itself, yet it still happens.
<br>
<p>A hierarchical authority can't keep up with the rapidly growing pace of
<br>
change and increasing complexity in society. It doesn't matter if
<br>
people want someone to micromanage their lives, or want to micromanage
<br>
others'. Any such authority will be too top-heavy to function
<br>
effectively. It will collapse, and it's in the mode of its collapse
<br>
that libertarians have a role to play. The more acquainted the public
<br>
is with libertarian ideas, the more gracefully hierarchical authority
<br>
will collapse and the less unnecessary damage it will do on its way
<br>
down.
<br>
<p>Group decisionmaking is necessary, but effective organizations will
<br>
acquire the neural, complex, de/poly-centralized characteristics of
<br>
market/ecological systems.
<br>
<p>I leave morality to the philosophers and clerics, but from a cybernetics
<br>
standpoint, libertarianism is inevitable.
