<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt;  &gt; That might be interesting. Even more interesting (to me) is the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that while
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  &gt; women commit most of the child abuse in the US, almost all of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in prison
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  &gt; for this crime are men.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Kinda depends on how you define abuse.
</em><br>
<p>No, it doesn't. Look the word up in the dictionary. (Read it twice.) That's what
<br>
the word means, and that's what the statistics are based on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Someone in the list posted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something about a tribe that has homosexual rituals at their coming of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age.  In most societies, forcing a boy to have sex with another man would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a horrible act of sexual child abuse and not an approach to manhood.
</em><br>
<p>In the case of the &quot;tribe&quot; it wouldn't be abuse. In the case of the ancient
<br>
Romans, it wouldn't be abuse, or the ancient (and maybe not so ancient) Greeks.
<br>
So, it's culture-content sensitive, just like all mores and traditions. Nothing
<br>
new there, no surprises.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Especially if there's a vast age difference.  Yet I doubt they see it that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way...at least not most of them.
</em><br>
<p>There's no reason for them to see it that way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what is the extropic definition of abuse?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think there is such a thing as the extropic definition of abuse, first
<br>
of all because abuse is not extropic, and secondly because extropy uses
<br>
definitions which work -- which means that diluting the meaning of words with
<br>
new and esoteric definitions creates lexigraphic entropy. If anything, extropic
<br>
definitions would tend to be more distinct, clear, and discrete. IOW, the most
<br>
extropic definition of a word is the one found in the most widely distributed
<br>
dictionary of the language. As a result, I've referred you to the dictionary
<br>
definition (preferably Webster's).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Quite a lot of bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things can be done to a child, and until society tells them it's wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they don't tend to recognize it as such.  Or a child can live our paradigm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a perfect life and still be miserable.
</em><br>
<p>Whether a particular act constitutes abuse has nothing to do with a child's
<br>
recognition of it. It matters not at all whether the child recognizes it as
<br>
abuse for it to be abuse. If a rose doesn't recognize that someone has
<br>
cultivated it, that does not lessen the cultivation. To say that a child can be
<br>
miserable when living a perfect life makes no sense whatever, unless you somehow
<br>
twist the definition of a perfect life to include being miserable. If you want
<br>
to twist words that much, go right ahead, but you haven't fooled anyone with
<br>
this trick.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Those who were beaten/sexually touched, when and if they escape,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to have a new love for life...at least so far as I've seen.
</em><br>
<p>So, we should beat children so that they'll develop a new love for life when
<br>
they escape.
<br>
How many children have you beaten in order to test this theory? Just kidding.
<br>
But seriously, I think I know what you're getting at here. When a painful
<br>
experience ends, then the ensuing relief seems lovely by comparison. By this
<br>
logic, a loving parent might beat an ugly child so that later in life, when the
<br>
child learns that its ugliness makes it impossible to socialize with the
<br>
beautiful people, it won't mind being alone. Hopefully not many on this list
<br>
would buy that as an excuse for beating a child.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who were gaurded from all these things and led a sheltered life are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ones who I've seen to be fairly neurotic.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Sheltering&quot; a child, as you describe it, would therefore constitute a form of
<br>
abuse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Those who were free to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own choices tend to be extremely hedonistic (yes, I'm aware these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are generalized stereotypes based only on my experiences).
</em><br>
<p>A nurturing, caring parent usually tries to guide a child to make intelligent
<br>
and practical choices, rather than to succumb to hedonism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is abuse defined as the level of unhappiness a child suffered from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences?
</em><br>
<p>No, not at all, unless the painful experiences and unhappiness resulted from
<br>
negligence or mistreatment on the parent's part.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Is it correlated to the end result of how a child turns out?
</em><br>
<p>Because a child receives input and experience from siblings, peers, teachers,
<br>
and society at large as well as from parents, one could say that the nature of a
<br>
child's total environment correlates to how a child turns out, yes. An abusive
<br>
environment will have a negative subjective effect. If a child overcomes that
<br>
effect, transcends it, or accepts it as a challenge to achievement and
<br>
accomplishment, then that is to the child's credit. This could lead one to think
<br>
that there is something to evolutionary psychology, genetic make-up, or
<br>
congenital capabilities. But it definitely doesn't absolve the abuse of
<br>
children, not even if the child in question is Charles Dickens, and he grows up
<br>
to entertain millions with brilliant novels.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; i.e.  if they live a peaceful yet unhappy childhood, then go on to hurt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others is it abuse, when by maybe dominating them a bit, they'd be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; submissive and less likely to hurt those around them?
</em><br>
<p>I really don't think that abused kids are as likely as well-loved kids to grow
<br>
up to be productive and happy people. To keep children from hurting those around
<br>
them, it's probably better not to hurt them. IOW:
<br>
&quot;What's done to children, they will do to society&quot;
<br>
--Karl Menninger
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can we tell what's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abuse before the result?
</em><br>
<p>If we are intelligent, mature, knowledgeable people, I think we can extrapolate
<br>
if a particular action is abusive, and what the result might be in terms of how
<br>
it could affect a child's development (within reasonable parameters). For
<br>
example, shooting up a two-year-old with heroin to keep it quiet would, in most
<br>
people's estimation, constitute abuse, don't you think? And, if a mother shoots
<br>
up heroin (or cocaine) while pregnant, some courts have ruled that amounts to
<br>
child abuse, since it results in a brain-damaged baby.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is there a way to avoid it if so?
</em><br>
<p>Is there a way to avoid abusing a child? Well, if a parent, guardian, or
<br>
childcare worker can't avoid abusing children, then it becomes the
<br>
responsibility of the community to remove children from the offending abuser, as
<br>
is usually done.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think it's safe to assume that burning someone with a hot iron
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or anything of that sort is pretty terrible, but a lot less horrible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unprovoked abuse is out there than hollywood tries to tell us (I could try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to prove this with statistics, but those would still just be numbers, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's not really that important to the argument/question).
</em><br>
<p>The statistics are important (if they are accurate) because they can tell us how
<br>
big the problem is. Burning someone (we're talking about children and/or infants
<br>
here) with a hot iron would generally be thought of as abuse -- unless the
<br>
infant in question is a male baby, and the hot iron is used to cauterize the
<br>
wound made by mutilating his sex organ in the operation euphemistically referred
<br>
to as circumcision.
<br>
(BTW, if someone were to strap a puppy to a board, and without anaesthics, cut
<br>
off the end of its penis, that someone would be liable to some serious prison
<br>
time. Doing the same to baby boys carries no penalty whatsoever.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One example:  My brother got in an argument with my mother where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she smacked him.  He pushed her, at which point she said he tried to kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her, and my Dad kicked the shit out of him.  My brother does not see what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my dad did as wrong...then again he didn't break any bones or anything, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it still doesn't cross that line.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds OK to me. I mean, it sounds like your brother had it coming, except that
<br>
your mother probably should not have smacked him, but then I wasn't there, and I
<br>
don't know exactly what caused her to smack him, plus it depends on how old he
<br>
was at the time, and whether he did actually try to kill her, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about all those who came out of loving/brainwashing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religiously zealous families?
</em><br>
<p>Don't get me started. I consider religious brainwashing one of the worst forms
<br>
of child abuse. But nobody's going to press charges against parents who send
<br>
their kids to parochial school or to Sunday school. So it's wasted effort to
<br>
rail against indoctrinating children with religiosity. On the other hand,
<br>
sending in flame-throwing tanks and helicopters with machine guns to rescue kids
<br>
from Branch Davidian David Koresh doesn't seem like the best solution either.
<br>
(Someone told me the only reason Janet Reno got away with that stunt was that
<br>
she's a woman. But I don't believe that.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They usually think they had a great family
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life, and try to pass the love on to everyone else.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it seems to be a disease that runs in families. Sort of like Republicanism.
<br>
&lt;grimace&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To the thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, they're pretty screwed up and sometimes dangerous.  In the families
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where religion was hostilly forced down someone's throat, sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violently, most that I know tended to rebel and eventually learn to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for themselves...although they're often unhappier.
</em><br>
<p>That's right, you can ask Extropy contributor Eliezer S. Yudkowsky about that,
<br>
except I don't think his parents ever did anything really hostile toward him.
<br>
Greg Burch once posted something about his parochial training, but he denied
<br>
that it came anywhere close to child abuse. In fact, as I recall, he wrote that
<br>
he has fond memories of his childhood experiences with religiosity. Spike has
<br>
posted that he's a recovered believer, and there are probably several others on
<br>
the list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, those who're weaker genetically, i.e. ugly, weak (in men),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unitellectual, tend to have a fairly horrible time growing up as well.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would think that an attractive, smart child with a bad home life stands a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better chance at being happy then one of God's unliked children.
</em><br>
<p>I'll go along with that. Mother Nature can be an abusive bitch all right. (Let's
<br>
leave theism out of it, OK?) Then again, some very attractive young ladies have
<br>
become whores, junkies, criminals, and Democrats &lt;phooey&gt; as a consequence of
<br>
what they describe as horribly unhappy childhood circumstances.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should it be considered abuse if one has children, knowing their genetics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are bad?
</em><br>
<p>Damned straight it should, at least in my book. I'd get sterilized before I'd
<br>
bring a deformed or severely defective kid into the world. It wouldn't be fair
<br>
to the child, and it wouldn't be fair to the rest of the community that had to
<br>
put up with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Especially the cases of parents with AIDS that have children...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or what about those that know a child is going to be sickly while in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; womb, and they still don't choose to have an abortion?  That child doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stand a sporting chance.
</em><br>
<p>Yup, I'd call those abusive parents, definitely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I hope someone reads this and has a good answer, but as for my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; input to the question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Every child is uniquely abused.  From this they develop a unique
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychological disorder called personality.  Most don't recognise this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disorder and develop concepts of right and wrong as a result.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably a good thing.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I have to disagree with you, because I know that some humans do not
<br>
experience abuse as children. One shining example is the life of Siddhartha
<br>
Gautama. I don't think Moses was abused as a child (did he ever get
<br>
circumcised?). Was Gilgamesh abused as a child? Charles Lindbergh? Ronald
<br>
Reagan? If you consider being spoiled as a kind of abuse, then I guess Hillary
<br>
Clinton was as abused as her daughter Chelsea. I'll bet you could find a hundred
<br>
people in one afternoon in Central Park who'd swear they were never abused. If
<br>
they don't think they were abused, I don't think so either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As society changes, so should the definition of abuse.  Once people can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; held to higher standards due to technological, or sociological advances,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they need a way to be encouraged to do so.  How much the law should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intervene, I don't know.  However As it stands I would prefer the law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cracking down on parents, if the child complains of abuse more often than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not.  Like any lawful intervention, some will get screwed, but if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child is one who would do that to their parents, it's fairly safe to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume that they didn't do a good job raising this child anyway.
</em><br>
<p>We're in agreement now, except that I'd add sometimes so-called &quot;child
<br>
protection agencies&quot; are motivated by the wrong goals. They often seek to punish
<br>
the innocent in order to alleviate their own guilt or anger about their own
<br>
damaged psyches. But that's par for the law enforcement community I guess.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for sexual abuse, the reason it's sooo terrible to a child is the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society looks at it.  Right now, pedophiles have a worse time in jail than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murderers.  And there's plenty of people I know who think we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; execute rapists but not murderers.  These things are never good things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but if society weren't so afraid to talk about it, maybe it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easier to recognise these characters.  They tend to do a lot worse things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when they become that afraid of their safety.  Personally it seems better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have a child maybe perform fellatio and yet know they won't get hurt,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then maybe a few less having this happen and the others being beaten into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; silence.  Can't say how to fix this though so hopefully someone has some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good answers.
</em><br>
<p>I just have the one question: How come almost all those in prison for child
<br>
abuse are men, despite the fact that women commit most of the child abuse? If
<br>
that doesn't show a huge bias against men and masculinity, then the general
<br>
public is as stupid as it is bigotted, and we should forget about trying to
<br>
advocate extropic memes, because humanity isn't worth the trouble.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for the original comment, women still tend to raise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children more, so by default they probably abuse them more.
</em><br>
<p>That's exactly right. The question is, since women do perpetrate most of the
<br>
child abuse, why are those in prison for this crime almost all men??
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
