<p>No, my actions can affect the future, at least as far as I can tell; my 
<br>
actions cannot affect the past, so it makes no sense to ask me for 
<br>
recommendations.  Curt85 and Curt90 would have been reasonable 
<br>
people to ask for decisions on Curt90 vs. Curt00, because they could
<br>
do something.  Curt00 has nothing to do with such as decision.
