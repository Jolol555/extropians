<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thanks Robin!  Both for sharing this slag by Hal Finney and for your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spirited defense.  I consider you a friend and an adult.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not that I consider Hal an &quot;enemy&quot;... no matter what he mutters about me!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Naturally, I know Hal. He sent extensive and vigorous criticism of early 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drafts of my controversial nonfiction book about openness: The Transparent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Freedom and Privacy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    I got used to his grouchy style then, enduring it for the sake of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those occasional gems one often discovers when listening patiently to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent fools, instead of simply dismissing them because they disagree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That typifies our difference, of course.  I deeply believe that no single 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human being can accurately model the world, especially with formulaic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideologies.  One mind cannot even model itself, let alone a complex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society. This has been proved by science in at least three fundamental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ways. Alas, this discovery hasn't prevented obsessive meme-fixation, only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;helped to abate it a bit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Indeed, this fact is deeply linked to the great tragedy of human history, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a chain horrid blunders made by countless individuals and societies over 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time -- blunders arising not so much from ignorance, as from mistakened 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainty.  Across all those sad millennia, only one palliative has ever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been found effective against our innate human drive to wallow again and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;again in satisfying oversimplifications and self-deceptive errors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That palliative (though we find it unpleasant) is criticism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hence, I am fond of Hal for many savagely caustic things he said about my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;early drafts.  His critiques (along with those of over four dozen selected 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opponents and nitpickers) helped me to refine my arguments in The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Transparent Society, winning me awards, good press and fat speaking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fees.  In other words, the very process I describe in the book seems to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have worked very well for me, thanks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     And I get to have low blood pressure, too.  I don't perceive many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;enemies.&quot;  Only lots of sarcastically helpful critics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm not sure which of my pieces Hal is railing against this time. Notice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that he only used vague generalities -- no attempts to paraphrase or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;describe what he objected to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Well, I presume it's one of my recent critiques of contemporary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarianism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     To a purist ideologue, my call for pragmatism -- in the tradition of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scots-American Enlightenment figures like Ben Franklin -- must seem like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utter betrayal.   Far better to remain pure and righteous and ineffective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than to engage in the gritty, compromise ridden world of practical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politics!  Above all, we must never acknowledge that any of our opponents 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have legitimate points to make.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There are so many levels to this.  Let's start with the most basic -- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychopharmacology!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Warning. What follows may be a bit long. But I eventually get back to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;main topic and it may be interesting enough to read, rather than skim.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Fascinating research indicates that moral indignation is one of the most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;potent known self-doping mechanisms for triggering massive secretions of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dopamine and endorphins within the brain, by pure mental volition 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alone!  As a psychotropic modifier, it can be as powerful as some illegal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hallucinogens.  It IS a well-known hallucinogen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Indeed, self-righteousness in some individuals offers a more rapid and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;steep fix than disciplined adepts achieve through deep meditation!  A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surge quicker than ingested or injected drugs.   Any of us can demonstrate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this by recalling times when we entered this indignant state of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness. (We all have!) Those of us who are honest will admit that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is an insidiously attractive high.  One that most decent folks try to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indulge only moderately or sparingly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nevertheless, we shouldn't be too harsh in assessing our brothers who are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resentment junkies, unable to wean themselves off the repeated chemical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;jolt that self-righteousness provides.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here are some suggested tests to check for dudgeon addiction, in yourself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or a neighbor:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         1) Are irate episodes rhythmic or episodic?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         2) Are they reliably induced by stress?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         3) Do they show traits that some theorists associate with fevered 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infection by a self-protective meme?  (e.g. exaggerated irate response to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mere disagreement or symbols in the environment?)  Do physiological 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fight-flight responses (flushes, rapid heartbeat, clenching, etc.) get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triggered, completely out of proportion to the person's immediate ability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do anything about the situation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         4) Is the person capable of reading an opponent's arguments 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carefully, without skimming, and then paraphrasing the adversary's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position with some accuracy, eschewing exaggeration or demonizing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caricatures? (Try it out here!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         5) Most telling of all is the Contempt Factor.  Is the person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deeply wedded to a belief that he is among just a few who see the world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly, while the great masses of his fellow citizens are befuddled 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sheep, prey to manipulation by propaganda?  Does he get pleasure from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this self-depiction?  (Come on now, be honest.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         6) Does he claim that his opponents hold their beliefs due to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flaws in their character, while HIS beliefs were (naturally) arrived at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through detached logic and selfless reason?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Notice how wonderfully convenient #5 and #6 are!  Of course, being human, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his opponents think exactly the same things about him, in reverse!  But an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideologue perceives no irony there.  He simply responds that he is right 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about them and they are wrong about him. Period.  Simple. No irony or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dilemma. No more need be said!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(A hint to the mature: whenever one of your own beliefs happens to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conveniently self-serving, that is the very time to feel a prickle of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suspicion.  It's time to seek every critical voice and counter-example, if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only to keep yourself grounded and verify you aren't fooling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yourself.  Alas, ideologues of all stripes cannot do this.  In my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experience, they cannot even scan what I have written between these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parentheses and parse the meaning accurately, without great effort. Try it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on a few and see!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Alas, this memic/psychopharmacological cycle demonstrates that ideology is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;far worse than just a foolish attempt to model complex systems with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paragraph-sized rants.  It is a deeply cruel self-doped addiction -- and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perhaps an insidious kind of infection -- that has been with us in many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forms for ages and was especially responsible for the hellish middle years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the Twentieth Century. It has far more in common with religion than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with any science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For more on this, people may want to take a little self-test ... or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Questionnaire on the Underlying Roots of Ideology&quot;... to be found at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;<a href="http://www.kithrup.com/brin/">http://www.kithrup.com/brin/</a>&gt;<a href="http://www.kithrup.com/brin/">http://www.kithrup.com/brin/</a>  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;questionnaire is ideologically neutral and aims only at pointing out some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the assumptions and processes that affect our choice of favorite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indignations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       Instead of prescribing or preaching, I only ask questions and hope 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to provoke serious discussion.  In fact, I do not know the answers to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many of the riddles posed there. I'd be very interested in hearing bright 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggestions!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Incidentally, in saying all this I do not claim we'd be better off 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without any ideologues!  In The Transparent Society I speak with much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;admiration of the positive effects of raising millions of educated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individualists, drunk on indignation and suspicious of all authority, each 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of them filled with ardor for one particular simpleminded model of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world and contempt for all others.  In an open society, they make great 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;immune cells against all kinds of error!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (But they are not deep thinkers.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;**
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ah, but having thus insulted poor Hal -- (by implicitly (and perhaps a bit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-righteously, I admit!) calling him a self-doping memic drug 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;addict)  -- I'll now happily change levels and deal with the superficial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;merits of his case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I consider myself to some large degree a libertarian (though admittedly a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heretic from today's obligatory standard dogma). I do because libertarians 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are correct in their belief that bureaucracies can oppress -- or more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely, stifle -- the right-hand of human creativity. Individual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competitiveness.  The long range goal must be an open society of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hyper-educated and hyper-free adults who are liberated to maximally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;achieve what their talents allow them to achieve.  Under such conditions, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will we even need states anymore?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Anyone who doubts my fealty to markets and other competitive systems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should see my recent paper &quot;Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Competition for Society's Benefit,&quot; which is the lead article in the most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recent American Bar Association Journal on Dispute Resolution (Ohio State 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; University), V.15, N.3, pp 597-618, Aug.2000.  (This article drew far 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more ire from lefties than I ever got from pallid attacks like Hal's!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Therein I present a model for &quot;accountability arenas&quot; and show that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; markets are just one example of this new kind of synergistic system in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human affairs, responsible for our society's tremendous fecundity, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom and wealth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So I'm loyal to competitive systems.  Libertarian, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       On the other hand, I AM a heretic to official dogma, because I see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how open-competitive systems have generally been stymied across time by a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human curse far deeper and more general than mere bureaucracy. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cheaters!  People who conspire to shut down open-competitive systems for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own biased benefit, squelching the opportunity and creativity of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others. And cheaters are remarkably adept at finding out whatever works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       I refuse to let some smug ideological mantra force blinkers over my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eyes, focusing my gaze on just one threat to liberty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It always astonishes me how many bright guys (nearly all male) consider 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves well educated while utterly ignoring 99% of human history! 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;During all that time, the sins of bureaucrats have been small potatoes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compared to the agenda of a far greater and more persistent foe of human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedom -- aristocracy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Get this.  EVERY SINGLE TIME AND PLACE THAT HUMANS INVENTED BOTH 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AGRICULTURE AND METALLURGY, SMALL BANDS OF BULLIES PICKED UP METAL 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;IMPLEMENTS IN ORDER TO STEAL OTHER MEN'S WOMEN AND WHEAT.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They then proceeded to set up social structures that guaranteed their sons 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the rights of lords and kings.  Religion and biased property rules 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eventually became even more effective tools for maintaining these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pyramidal social orders than picking up swords.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Some call it feudalism. Others liken it to schoolyard bullying. Some use 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;.  Whatever you call it, the phenomenon happened nearly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everywhere on Earth(!) with utter and dreary predictability. (Under 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so-called communism this elite clade of aristocratic thieves were called 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;commisars&quot; and they followed the exact-same pattern with complete 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reliability, replacing the old Czarist elites under a thin patina of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;altered verbal rationalizations. &quot;Communism&quot; actually had nothing at all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to do with their power-cabal.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Whatever you call the aristocratic kleptocracy, it's clearly the most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;natural human social order. And it stinks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The only way to avoid it has been to set up a civil society of laws and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;balanced interests, reciprocal accountability, high education levels, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regulated markets and... yes, some scrupulously constrained bureaucracy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Those who say otherwise bear a steep burden of proof!  I have for years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;defied them to name ONE other society that did a better job of replacing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feudal gangs with competitive markets than we have done here, now, in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;sheeplike&quot; culture they express so much contempt for!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Can they name even one culture that was more wonderfully set up to raise, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;train, and unleash legions of libertarians?  Any other nations or tribes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that even HAD appreciable numbers of libertarians?  Or even the concept?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You don't think your own libertarianism came about as a result of cultural 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;training&quot;?  Oh really?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then name even one other society in which the principal propaganda message 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was like ours.  Our central theme (seen in all our films) is Suspicion of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Authority!  Go on, deny that's the romantic zeitgeist conveyed by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rambunctious protagonist in nearly every modern movie!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And you actually think you invented it?  Honey, you suckled it from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society's teat since long before you could talk. You couldn't have been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more thoroughly &amp; relentlessly programmed if you was a computer.   (If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;sheep&quot; are defined as those whose beliefs were determined by propaganda 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;messages, what does that make you, Hal?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Alphas tend to see the irony in this and smile, without losing an iota 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their individualism... only a smidgen of their useless rancor. Betas 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just get mad.  (&quot;How DARE you imply that my individualism was TAUGHT to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me by the very society I despise!!&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;***
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Oh, never mind about that for now. Back to the main point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People who cannot see that liberty has a myriad threats -- including 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;old-time aristocracy -- are fools blithely guarding just one sector of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liberty's wall.  Worse, they invite barbarians inside the citadel to help 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;defend&quot; it.  Barbarians who, in helping us combat bureaucrats, do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everything in their power to convert our unique &quot;diamond-shaped&quot; society 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of rambunctious-educated hyperindividuals back into a traditional pyramid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of inherited privilege.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    I say feh!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Even worse than welcoming 'help' from barbarians and would-be lords, these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;goofy-bright fools demonize and call &quot;enemy&quot; people like me, who are at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least as deeply devoted as they are to a world of liberty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Double-feh.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Check it out.  I'm the paranoid one here!  Because I fear ALL threats to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liberty, not just one convenient variety of boogeymen that happens to fit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a narrow ideology.  I want to pit them all against each other in open 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opposition.  I want all the elites stripped naked so I can see what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they've got.  And if someone else considers ME to be a worrisome elite... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well then I'm no hypocrite. I'll grumble and strip down too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   So long as they do first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is exactly what's worked for us so far.  Damn if I'll be the first to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;abandon it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;**
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Enough.  This could go on and on, but I have better things to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Let me just say in conclusion that severe myopia about history, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychopharmacology, and basic complexity theory seem destined to hobble 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;both libertarianism and extropianism, making both of them look silly to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our contemporaries, as well as to our heirs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Only when we are willing to admit how human we are, and therefore wedded 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to a myriad primitive self-deceptions, can we finally start using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;criticism -- and a healthy sense of ironic humor -- to rise above 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-righteous delusions and get to the really interesting meta-human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stuff.  Fun stuff that calls for mature negotiated cooperation, as well as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Only then will we be able to pragmatically persuade our rather unsheeplike 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fellow citizens to trust us with some power to try out a few of our clever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Till then, I'm afraid our fellow citizens will be quite right not to trust 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thee -- or me -- with anything more powerful than a burnt match.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What honest/mature person could blame them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With cordial regards.
</em><br>

<em>&gt;PS... I hear there's been a lot of comment on this site but have only read 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hal's &quot;enemy&quot; comment and Robin's response.  I quit this list some time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ago for the very reason just stated.  I share goals and dreams with many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of you.  But the rants are just plain tiresome.

<em>&gt;    Want to know the difference between the opinions of grownups and those

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lecture to us about capitalism when you've made some money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Tell us about tyrants when you've actually fought one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Orate about the future after others agree that you've already helped to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make it better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Preach about science when you've discovered something new that survived 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all tests.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Tell us how to be meta-human when your neighbors admire you as a mensch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   That's the only pad worth launching from.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Till then, enjoy this magnificent civilization.  It's far better
