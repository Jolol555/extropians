Michael M. Butler, &lt;<a href="mailto:butler@comp-lib.org?Subject=Re:%20Civilization%20and%20Enemies,%20was%20Re:%20CONFESSIONS%20OF%20A%20CHEERFUL%20LIBERTARIAN%20By%20David%20Brin&In-Reply-To=&lt;200012020614.WAA21505@finney.org&gt;">butler@comp-lib.org</a>&gt;, writes (quoting Hal):
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The problem with &quot;I am a member of a civilization&quot; is that it doesn't say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whether the civilization is good or bad.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it is true that, taken by itself, then notion is so boiled down as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be too value free. How about &quot;I am a member of an increasingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enlightened planetary civilization&quot;? Welp, it sounds awful prissy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NWO; besides, the Nazis probably thought that too.
</em><br>
<p>This one is better, because it also raises the question, what is it
<br>
about our civilization which entitles it to be called &quot;increasingly
<br>
enlightened&quot;, and what can we do to make sure it continues to head in
<br>
the right direction.  Well, one of the things we can do is to defend
<br>
the values which we believe lead to enlightment.
<br>
<p>I would suggest that one such important value is recognizing each person
<br>
as an individual and not part of a class.  This is partially associated
<br>
with traditionally &quot;conservative&quot; values of freedom of opportunity
<br>
and absence of economic barriers.  But it also is seen in &quot;liberal&quot;
<br>
movements like civil rights and equality for women.  Where once a person
<br>
was judged by race and sex, we now try to look past those characteristics
<br>
and see the person within.  These are among the traits that most represent
<br>
enlightment to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Principles *are* important. One principle that's important is not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; burn the barn down while the horse is still inside.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't follow what that means in this context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's an old saw that cuts both ways. In this case, I meant that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premature polarization (enemy talk) can cost you. Brin might not be as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful to your goals as an enemy as he might be as a grudgingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respected gadfly with whom you have piquant disagreement.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps so.  However I have been debating David Brin on these matters in
<br>
email and in public since 1994.  All I have accomplished (if anything)
<br>
is to help him craft his message more seductively.  His goals don't seem
<br>
to have changed.
<br>
