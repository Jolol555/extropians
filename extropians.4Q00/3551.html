<p><em>&gt;I agree with Hal Finney on the overblown rhetoric in this case. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've been surprised to see both CNN and Wired making such a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deal over such a relatively timid experiment.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;In the context of work that uses *brain* implants to restore
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vision to sightless people, or give quadrapalegics the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;move cursors, Warwick's research seems quite pedestrian.
</em><br>

<br>
There is a small piece in the Nov/Dec issue of MIT's Technology
<br>
Review (magazine) on &quot;silicon retinas&quot; essentially thousands of
<br>
microphotodiodes designed to stimulate the underlying nerve tissue.
