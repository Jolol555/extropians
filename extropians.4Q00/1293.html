<p>You would think this would be good proof that the Bible is not the holy Word
<br>
of The One True God, but Christian literature I've read (don't ask) squirms
<br>
out of this one by muttering things about thick rims.  As far as I could
<br>
make out, if the 'brim to brim' was measured to the the outside of a very
<br>
thick bowl, and the 'line of thirty cubits' was measred around the _inside_
<br>
of the bowl, it works out.  Absolute crap, as I have come to expect from
<br>
popular Christian lit.  :-)
