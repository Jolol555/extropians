</em><br>

<p>Seeing this topic of space development come up, I can't resist
<br>
mentioning a kind of variation on Zubrin's &quot;Mars Direct&quot; that would
<br>
likely relate to asteroid and/or O'Neill settlements. in the long run.
<br>
This is a &quot;Phobos Race&quot; article that was published in the Fall, 1987,
<br>
issue of the _New Destinies_ paperback magazine. I know this may seem a
<br>
slightly dated source, however, the ideas of &quot;S. Fred Singer, former
<br>
astronaut Brian O'Leary, and planetary scientist Bruce M. Cordell&quot; which
<br>
this article reports on, are still relevant today. Well OK, I'll 'fess
<br>
up and add that I used to read something like this in the old _L5 News_
<br>
space advocacy publication, too. There, Eric Drexler sometimes used to
<br>
severely criticize the whole idea of spending money on &quot;man on Mars&quot;
<br>
expeditions, while at the same time promoting the use of automated
<br>
asteroid miners (with Mars' &quot;asteroid-like&quot; moons definitely in the
<br>
picture as worth mining). Then too, Drexler used to pan lunar bases on
<br>
*our* moon, figuring that he could more cheaply develop the hardware to
<br>
do very simple &quot;carpet sweeper&quot; mining of asteroids (or of Mars' moons),
<br>
as compared to setting up lunar landers and launchers to do anything
<br>
similar in our own Moon's relatively large gravity well. The general
<br>
idea was to develop off-Earth material supplies and manufacturing with
<br>
as little &quot;up front&quot; investment as possible.
<br>
<p>Anyway, getting back to the _New Destinies_ article, the
<br>
Singer/O'Leary/Cordell plan, those gentlemen wanted to take the mining
<br>
of Mars moons one step further by placing the emphasis on robotic Mars
<br>
explorations, with Phobos and Deimos as bases that astronauts could
<br>
travel to relatively easily, compared with the extra trouble of actually
<br>
landing humans on Mars. Although this particular article didn't quite
<br>
say so, I get the impression that it would actually be more &quot;sanitary&quot;,
<br>
as well as cheaper, if humans just orchestrated the robot rovers from
<br>
orbit. Essentially, there'd be no risk of humans biocontaminating Mars'
<br>
surface in such a scenario, despite the astronauts being close enough to
<br>
control the robots in real time, without the large Earth to Mars
<br>
communications time lag.
<br>
<p>The only drawback that I can see to this idea is that it would involve
<br>
the risk of long duration missions to Mars' vicinity for the astonauts.
<br>
At the same time, I'd note that it might well be reasonable to hold off
<br>
sending astronauts at all until new methods like advanced solar sails
<br>
were available, to get the travel time down to something less than a
<br>
couple of months perhaps? Anyway, it makes a nice picture, gives the
<br>
astronauts something more interesting to *do* in space than just take
<br>
lunar or asteroid rock samples, don't you think? Even if one never set
<br>
foot on Mars, doesn't it sound interesting, to be digging into old
<br>
streambeds via robotic proxy, searching for ancient life, maybe study
<br>
situations generally comparable to Earth's environments even if life
<br>
isn't found?
<br>
<p>On a technical level, notice how important virtual reality technology
<br>
would be for the success of something like this! You'd really want your
<br>
astronauts to be able to &quot;get down there&quot;, virtually speaking, and steer
<br>
their rovers directly to examine whatever is most interesting. So, we've
<br>
got lots of issues to think about in a scenario like this, including the
<br>
one of whether telepresence technology is going to be up to the task.
