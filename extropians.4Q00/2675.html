<p><em>&gt; Anders Sandberg asks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...should parents be allowed to add any &quot;enhancement genes&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to their children?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not? In the US, parents (in this case, irresponsible dolts) are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowed to bring children into the world even though they (the parents)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't the means to support or properly nourish the children.
</em><br>
<p>I think most of us on this list think that germline modifications
<br>
should be allowed. But some modifications may not be particularly
<br>
desirable for the person one he/she/it grows up (like an outre skin
<br>
color, hardwired sexual preferences or a &quot;natural&quot; lifespan of 45
<br>
years). Clearly we are not in favor of *all* modifications, and the
<br>
question is what ethical and legal rules we would like to see in this
<br>
area. Most bioethics has been of the &quot;just say no to germline
<br>
engineering!&quot;-style so far, to my knowledge there has been less
<br>
studies of a transhumanist approach to what changes are good, bad and
<br>
should be allowed or disallowed.
<br>
<p>One ethical principle I have been thinking of is reversibility:
<br>
genetic modifications that have reversible effects (e.g. controllable
<br>
using artificial hormones) should obviously be OK, since if you don't
<br>
like them you can always switch them off at a low cost.
<br>
<p>Another is flexibility: changes that increase the available range of
<br>
potentially desirable options are preferable to changes or states with
<br>
more limited options.

<p><em>&gt; Should they also be able to sue if their parents don't add certain

</em><br>
<p>I guess that under the current US system (+ such modifications) that
<br>
would be a possibility too. I guess that if parents had the
<br>
opportunity (and money) to fix a broken gene but didn't, then they are
<br>
responsible for the possible illness that could result.  Of course, if
<br>
you mix in religious freedom here things get iffy, I don't know what
<br>
supercedes what here. 
<br>
<p>When you come to positive enhancements, it is not clear to me that it
<br>
makes sense to sue for (say) not getting the Adobe Biosystems
<br>
Creativity Gene 4.2 since it was just one option among many. If the
<br>
majority of people get intelligence upgrades for their children but
<br>
the person that sues didn't, then there might be more of a case - but
<br>
can you sue your parents for sending you to a bad school or college if
<br>
they could afford a better one? (a roughly equivalent situation) I
<br>
doubt that (but then again, the wonderful world of US litigation
<br>
appears to be as much as a wonderland where anything can happen as
<br>
mythical Hollywood from this side of the atlantic).
<br>
<p>Here in Sweden the question is academic of course, since even if you
<br>
won you would not get much money at all.
