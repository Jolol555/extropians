Spike: you're remembering it better than it was. As I recall, the error
<br>
message was &quot;?&quot;.
<br>
And we had to trundle the card decks uphill both ways. And the chain
<br>
printers, don't talk to me about them--I still have the scars on my
<br>
back.

<em>&gt; ASCII code into granite punch cards.  The floppies each had a capacity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one bit.  And they crashed half the time.  The error message was:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Data unreadable.  Was it a 0 or a 1?&quot;  Since the clock rate on the

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the place on the disk where you thought the data was.  The keyboards
</em><br>
