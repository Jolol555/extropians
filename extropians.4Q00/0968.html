Anders Sandberg:
<br>
<em>&gt; I met him a few weeks back at a course in Trieste. He has some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting ideas about the cerebellum as a modelling/inverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kinematics system which I don't believe in as an explanation for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cerebellum, but makes a lot of sense for a robot architecture. One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsystem models the expected outcome of actions, the other calculates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what do do in order to achieve an outcome. He showed some videos of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the various robots at the project, and they were quite impressive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (although robots on presentation videos are *always* impressive, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course).
</em><br>
<p>The third chapter of _Robo sapiens_ is online at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.discover.com/sept_00/featbiobot.html">http://www.discover.com/sept_00/featbiobot.html</a>
<br>
also see: <a href="http://robosapiens.mit.edu/">http://robosapiens.mit.edu/</a>
<br>
&quot;...Robot researchers take pains to distinguish themselves from robot pundits.
<br>
But there is something so magical about the creation of artificial living
<br>
creatures -- mechanical entities with lifelike behavior -- that even the
<br>
soberest of these inventors wonder about what lies ahead for their creation, and
<br>
for humankind.
<br>
There is no shortage of soothsayers who prognosticate about the shape of
<br>
millennia to come: Kevin Warwick, Rodney Brooks, Bill Joy, Hans Moravec, and
<br>
their fellows. Robotics, they all agree, will form the future....&quot;
<br>
(There's a photo of Kawato on page 55.)
<br>
<p>With respect to your comment: &quot;robots on presentation videos are *always*
<br>
impressive, of course&quot;, Mark Tilden has this to say:
<br>
Tilden is always wary of what he calls &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; demonstrations: 'Pay no
<br>
attention to that graduate student behind the curtain -- I am the great and
<br>
powerful roboticist of Oz.' If you see a machine with a whacking great big cable
<br>
or antenna coming off it going to a supercomputer run by various grad students,
<br>
then you are looking at a Wizard of Oz demonstration. If it repeats a behavior
<br>
pattern, then you've got a puppeteer on tape. There are over 10,000
<br>
special-effects masters on the planet right now. But if you count the number of
<br>
people who are really researching robots, who are trying to go beyond fiction,
<br>
the total is small compared to the people who are making Jim Henson machines
<br>
that run using human control.&quot;
<br>
<p>According to _Robo sapiens_, imitation is the essence of human intelligence. We
<br>
learn various kinds of tasks by watching, so Kawato recorded human movement for
<br>
DB (dynamic brain) to learn from.
<br>
One of the most striking achievements in this area was done by Christopher
<br>
Atkeson of Georgia Tech, open-loop juggling. Open-loop juggling is the technical
<br>
term for juggling without feedback, blindfolded juggling in this case, as the
<br>
robot did not use its vision, just its repeat movement, to not lose the balls.
<br>
Robots can already do many thing that humans can't. For example, the dexterous
<br>
arm robot can balance a pole in the palm of its hand for two or three hours.
<br>
(Try to do it for fifteen minutes.) So how does this teach us something about
<br>
the human brain?
<br>
<p>Stefan Schaal (Dynamic Brain project member and neurophysicist at the University
<br>
of Southern California) says they are looking into principles of learning and
<br>
self-organization that allow a system to develop and become intelligent by
<br>
itself. A major premise in biology is that there is structure in the world and
<br>
this structure is recognized by the brain. Based on this structure, the brain
<br>
can bootstrap itself, through learning and self-organization, to become better
<br>
and better.
<br>
This is the process that Dynamic Brain researchers would like to understand.
<br>
It's clear this can't happen from nothing, so what must be happening is that the
<br>
genome is giving us some information about how to learn -- what the right
<br>
learning algorithms are for the problems that the system is facing. And
<br>
researchers have to figure out what the basic ideas or these biases are which
<br>
come from the genetic coding. But from there onward they believe that the brain
<br>
can self-organize.
<br>
This is a different way of thinking. It is basically, in the end, a huge neural
<br>
network that self-organizes automatically to reach this level of intelligence
<br>
and competence that we see in biological systems.
<br>
<p>In the textbooks, a neural network is a network of many simple units with simple
<br>
capacities. These units are connected in such a way that the connections can
<br>
change depending on the circumstances. The idea, which became widely known in
<br>
the 1980s, is to model the neurons of the brain, which can knit themselves into
<br>
new configurations to create memories and skills. DB researchers aren't doing
<br>
neural networking in the old-fashioned sense. This was pretty much gone at the
<br>
end of the eighties. It's much more statistical learning -- we have a very clear
<br>
understanding about the statistical properties of the learning systems we use,
<br>
says Schaal. In statistical learning, the machine has a statistical model of how
<br>
its sensory data are generated, and it uses learning algorithms that exploit
<br>
this knowledge to assure statistical convergence to good learning results. DB
<br>
learns much more from 'statistical insights' than from any attempt by the
<br>
researcher to say, &quot;oh, this is how the brain seems to connect neurons, let's
<br>
put it together this way and try to understand it later.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a biological point of view, what DB researchers are inspired by is the
</em><br>
cerebellum, as you've pointed out. The cerebellum is a huge learning machine, a
<br>
real-time learning machine. It has tremendous capacity, and we don't know how to
<br>
duplicate that. What DB researchers have developed is not getting even close to
<br>
the cerebellum, but it outperforms anything out there, in this domain. Not that
<br>
it's better than everybody else, but in this domain, when it comes to motor
<br>
learning, nobody can compete with what they are developing. But they have been
<br>
developing DB especially for this purpose. So it is like they have a special
<br>
domain and there they are good. But if you put DB in another domain, it will
<br>
suck (Schaal's words).
<br>
<p>For example, the Cog project at MIT has the goal of making something cognitive,
<br>
a robot that can think with self-awareness, like a human being. Schaal thinks
<br>
that maybe his project is a little bit more boring. He just basically wants to
<br>
have a humanoid robot to do computational neuroscience. And he focuses on very
<br>
boring details of robotics... small problems. He makes very incremental progress
<br>
with these things. He doesn't have a POV about cognition or consciousness, or
<br>
believe that the robot is ever necessarily going to be conscious. He believes,
<br>
as Kawato says, that this might happen by itself at some point, if we just do
<br>
our work and understand more and more about the brain.
<br>
