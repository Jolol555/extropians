Yes, anyone who has read either uplift trilogy will see how he blithely
<br>
accepts ideas of government enforced eugenics programs applied to all
<br>
members of a species, should see how he is no libertarian, although he
<br>
did redeem a bit in the second trilogy (Brightness Reef, Infinity's
<br>
Shore, Heaven's Reach) by depicting a society of 'sooners' of several
<br>
species illegally colonizing a fallow world, and sympathized with the
<br>
view of a more anarchical society and against dogma, fascism, and force.
<br>
He is smarmily two faced about things, and is right to understand that
<br>
'wishywashy' individuals like himself are no good.

<em>&gt; As long term list members will recall, we have had some acrimonious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debates with David Brin on this list about his attitudes towards privacy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He ran into similar highly negative responses from others in the online
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe it is this issue which has brought him to his present meta-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis of attitudes and ideologies.  It was a terrible shock to him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to find himself accused of supporting tyranny and wanting to quash the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom of individuals to communicate privately.  He didn't really think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of himself as tyrant material.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So he has launched a meta ideological battle on a number of fronts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguing against ideology itself in favor of pragmatic compromise.  He also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be attacking individualist philosophy.  His mantra, &quot;I am a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; member of a civilization&quot; is meant to remind us of how we owe to others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I consider the ideas Brin is pushing to be significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threats to the values which are most important to me.  I don't want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonize the guy, but based strictly on his current writings I have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view him as an enemy.  I hope people can see past the smiling face and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jokey writing style to recognize the importance and seriousness of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues he is raising.  David Brin is a dedicated and sincere ideological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warrior who is fighting a long-term, well-planned campaign to use his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing skills to influence public opinion.
