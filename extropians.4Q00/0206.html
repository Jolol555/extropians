<p><em>&gt; It's not clear that the kids *have* First Amendment rights while they're at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school.  Courts have generally found that they have some civil rights at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school, but far more curtailed than an adult would have.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds good to me. Reminds me of the old jape, &quot;When does an embryo become a
<br>
human being?&quot;
<br>
&quot;When it votes Libertarian.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Kids today are more indignant.  (I am reminded of the study that found that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American kids lagged behind other developed countries in all academic areas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but led the world in self-esteem.)
</em><br>
<p>I wonder if that's more true of American girls or boys.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The trouble with asserting rights as a kid (or as a parent, on behalf of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children) is that after you've made a stink, you have to go back to the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school, to the same teacher.  And won't they be glad to see you....
</em><br>
<p>Then again, American parents have the right to move their kids to Montana and
<br>
home school them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And kids want to blend in, not stick out.  They worry not just about how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teacher will retaliate but whether the other kids will tease or harass them.
</em><br>
<p>Very true. Peer pressure probably does more to form young minds than does the
<br>
curricula.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When I finish that book on libertarianism for kids, my next book may be on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children's rights, also for kids.  What their rights are, and how to assert
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them -- in school, at the mall, against their parents, etc.  It's their call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as to whether to act against an injustice; I'd like them to know what their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; options are.
</em><br>
<p>All right! A children's liberation advocate. I like that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The tough issue for me:  Kids come in all stripes and colors.  Some are mature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and responsible, some are wild animals, and some are in-between.  From my POV,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rules, particularly those in school, give adults broad discretion with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little recourse and few repercussions for treating children in a way that
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; be wholly unacceptable if applied to adults.  On the other hand, inner-city
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teachers complain that, in this oversensitive, litigious age, they feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerless to deal with disciplinary problems.
</em><br>
<p>I think they should not only &quot;feel&quot; powerless to rule and control kids, they
<br>
should *be* powerless, and let the kids evolve to autonomous responsibility of
<br>
their own device. That's probably the best way to provide an environment in
<br>
which a Siddhartha Gautama, Moses, Lao Tzu, Galileo, Socrates, et al., can grow
<br>
up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think children are the one of the hardest issue for a libertarian to grapple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with.  What rights should children have?
</em><br>
<p>Basically, I think they should have the right to think for themselves, and to
<br>
choose whatever philosophy (philosopher, science, school of thought, etc.) suits
<br>
them best, regardless of the personal opinions of parents and teachers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Where do the rights of a parent end?
</em><br>
<p>Parents rights ought to end where children's rights begin, IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What right does the rest of society have to interfere with how I raise my
</em><br>
child?
<br>
<p>If your child becomes a serial killer, society has the right not only to
<br>
interfere, but also to hold you responsible. This kind of policy would have the
<br>
added benefit of discouraging many people from becoming parents, thereby helping
<br>
to alleviate the overpopulation problem. (All social problems derive directly or
<br>
indirectly from overpopulation.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should the rights be age-based, or is there a reasonable way to assess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, maturity, and judgment?
</em><br>
<p>I'd say children (and everyone, for that matter) should be evaluated on the
<br>
basis of their actions, their behavior, and their social conduct, rather than on
<br>
the basis of age or whatever psychotropic substances they choose to put into
<br>
their bodies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Libertarian Party platform takes a stab at it, but some of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions seem absurd.  They feel that &quot;children always have the right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establish their maturity by assuming administration and protection of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own rights, ending dependency upon their parents or other guardians, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assuming all responsibilities of adulthood.&quot;  Sure....  How about three-year-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; olds who don't want to take a nap?
</em><br>
<p>If you focus on waking the 3-year-old from its naps at a regular and specified
<br>
times instead of trying to make them take a nap at a specific time, this problem
<br>
evaporates. Kids will go to sleep when they get sleepy enough. When kids get
<br>
mature enough to object to being awakened at a particular time (selected by a
<br>
parent or caretaker), then kids can decide for themselves what time to begin
<br>
their naps.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Animal rights are also hard.  Why is it a property crime to kill Koko, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gorilla with an IQ of 70, when it's murder to kill a human with an IQ of 70?
</em><br>
<p>Given today's atmosphere of animal rights versus human rights, I'd guess it
<br>
would be easier to kill a retarded human than to kill a healthy gorilla. As for
<br>
laws which pertain to this comparison, remember that the 70 IQ human probably
<br>
has parents capable of litigation, but the gorilla does not. The old saw still
<br>
rings true, &quot;It's not what you know that counts, but who you know.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We already have a system of fractional civil rights -- certain rights for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adult citizens vs. felons vs. children vs. non-citizens vs. retarded -- why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not extend it to non-humans?
</em><br>
<p>I'd be more in favor of moving in the opposite direction on this. Instead of
<br>
extending the concept of rights to non-humans, why not give rights only to those
<br>
who demonstrate that they know what to do with them?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that the issues surrounding children and animals are worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploring in depth because how we deal with them illuminates how we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorporate new variants into our society -- transhumans, transanimals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clones, AIs, aliens, uploads, downloads, reanimated cryonauts, etc.  Without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the component of BS inherent in any discussion of the latter.  Children and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animals aren't speculative developments; they're here now, and we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands of years of experience with them.
</em><br>
<p>In the future, as in the past and present, the real law of the land (and the law
<br>
that really decides things), is that anyone can do anything they want as long as
<br>
they can back it up. IOW, you can do anything you can get away with. Obviously
<br>
special interest groups get away with modifying this natural law to suit their
<br>
own purposes, but that only confirms the validity of natural law as it extends
<br>
to special interest groups and other entities.
