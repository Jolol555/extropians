<p>
A month or two ago, I was reading Slashdot, and came across a link to 
<br>
www.extropy.org.  I glanced at it and book-marked it for later 
<br>
perusal.  I had never heard of extropianism (adding the word to my 
<br>
email's dictionary now. :), but the one paragraph mission statement, 
<br>
was enough to warrant a little more research.
<br>
<p>This past weekend, I went back to the site and took the time to read 
<br>
through some of the material there.  First, I read Extropian 
<br>
Principles 3.0, and I must at very least say, &quot;Wow!&quot;
<br>
<p>If you'd know me, you'd know that I'm not prone to emotionally 
<br>
rendered superlatives in my everyday life.  Normally, I couldn't 
<br>
imagine joining a mailing list and gushing &quot;Wow!&quot; in front of a bunch 
<br>
of strangers - but more than anything, I wanted to express this 
<br>
particular emotion to the group that has elicited it, while it was 
<br>
still fresh in my mind.
<br>
<p>I have never in my thirty-two years read any type of statement of 
<br>
principles that so thoroughly agrees with my own outlook on life. 
<br>
The mix of libertarianism and rationalism combined with the 
<br>
forward-thinking goal of using technology to better ourselves in 
<br>
every way possible sounds too good to be true.
<br>
<p>I'm really hoping that what's inside the box is as wonderful as the 
<br>
wrapping paper - and I'll be lurking for quite some time while I try 
<br>
to figure that very thing out.  It'll also take me a bit to get 
<br>
through that recommended reading list - ugh, homework! :)
<br>
<p>Best Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
