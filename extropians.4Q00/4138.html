Ah, friend Eugene, I said &quot;paper(like)&quot;.  An augmented shared reality
<br>
headup, while fun and useful, can have tactical limitations. You have to
<br>
haul it around on your head and someone can hit you with a rock or
<br>
automobile from your blind spot, literal or cognitive. I want one, but
<br>
not always, not for a while yet. Not until sensor fusion and such can
<br>
guarantee I'll always have a clear view of what might kill me. And heck,
<br>
I don't have that *now* :).
<br>
<p>On the gripping hand, retinas are paperlike, or so I'm told. :)
<br>
<p>The problem with defining the standards &quot;right&quot; is that the broken but
<br>
sort of extensible ones tend to win because they're easy to implement.
<br>
See HTML. OTOH, VRML sucked and hasn't got a chance of becoming the
<br>
truly immersive standard.... right? we hope?
<br>
<p>Time to really push for something based on Meme?
<br>
