<p>
Hello,
<br>
<p>There are many rapid advancements across broad fronts of scientific and
<br>
technological research.  As well, the fundamental mathematical sciences
<br>
advance.
<br>
<p>At the same time, people's lives are not so different from hundreds of
<br>
years ago, except many more people have automobiles, high technology
<br>
appliances and devices, and medicine, as well as entertainment.
<br>
<p>A cloning instance no longer makes the regular news.  Public health is
<br>
generally at a very good level, except for high levels of HIV infection
<br>
in some areas, for which large public monies research cures.  Modern
<br>
surgical medicine is able to perform regular operations that perform
<br>
lifesaving actions that ten or twenty years ago would not have been
<br>
possible.  There are cars that drive themselves.
<br>
<p>So in ten years, there will have been many more sweeping technological
<br>
advancements.  Much of it will be space- or time- saving, or otherwise
<br>
convenient.  Some earlier cultures of man lived the hunter-gather life
<br>
with four hours of a day towards subsistence activities to acquire the
<br>
economic means of lifestyle and quality of life, and the rest spent in
<br>
leisure activities.  Today, many work more hours per day and find
<br>
satisfaction from their work, some are overworked for economic
<br>
requirements.
<br>
<p>Some activities can not be compressed or delegated.  For example, using
<br>
an adding machine or spreadsheet software, it is possible to perform
<br>
many calculations rapidly.  The time to perform that activity is
<br>
compressed.  The delegation is like the dishwasher, fill it with dishes
<br>
and it will wash the dishes.  Generally, local human interaction is
<br>
un-compressible, yet the context might be familiar.  Advanced
<br>
technological methods of communication like a distributed newsletter
<br>
allow many to receive a communication at one time, or e-mail software
<br>
might have ways to address to many people simultaneously.  Thus, people
<br>
will have more time and incentive to spend in the activities that
<br>
technology itself does not directly address.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, there are technological paradigm shifts.  Those
<br>
affect the context for people in general, or specifically in significant
<br>
ways.  There is rapid advancement on the genomic front.  If you think
<br>
about it, a gene might have many thousands of pairs on it.  So, for
<br>
example, there might be N! combinations of that.  It is not infeasible
<br>
to think that in the future that genomic changes be possibly made ready
<br>
and simple.  It is a dangerous field morally because it is in the
<br>
context of human's deeply ingrained sense of self-preservation.  So,
<br>
ethically we can examine it generally.  In the future in public health
<br>
classes at school, they can talk about the genome during genome
<br>
education.
<br>
<p>The artificial intelligence methods that exist are truly wonderful in
<br>
their nature.  There will be more expert systems, and ways to interact
<br>
with your own personal computer.
<br>
<p>In terms of physics and the eternal quest for the fundamental nature of
<br>
reality, what is taught today was new ten years ago.
<br>
<p>Nanotechnology can make a lot of positive beneifts to society.  Consider
<br>
the computer processor of today, perhaps it is microtechnology.
<br>
Nanotechnology, working a little closer to the bounds of physical
<br>
precision possible, will make the production of high quantities of
<br>
structural components, as well, it will be able to enable high-tolerance
<br>
microtechnology.  Nanotechnology is also dangerous, but so is the
<br>
knowledge of nuclear reactions and and the fact that many hydrocarbons
<br>
are spilled into the atmosphere.
