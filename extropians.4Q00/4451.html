<em>&gt;  Anders Sandberg

<p><em>&gt; Back in my day, we didn't even have the full set of Peano's axioms. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't have 'zero', so we had to do without natural numbers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addition. We had to make do with scraps from empty sets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you tell that to the youth today they just don't believe you.
</em><br>
<p>You've obviously never had to build your own pocket of spacetime.
<br>
Fundamental unit by fundamental unit with rusty, broken tweezers handed down
<br>
from the previous universe.  You had scraps from empty sets?  You're lucky.
<br>
In my day we didn't have the luxury of the existence of empty sets.  Only one
<br>
of our neighbors had half a { and then most of the time it didn't even work.
<br>
<p>You think you had it tough.  In those days television wasn't even in black
<br>
and white.  Everything was in black and white!  And that was only years and
<br>
years after anything was differentiated at all!  Oh, other people will tell
<br>
you that it was always cold.  Bah!  That shows you what they know.  Back then
<br>
it was always very hot!  Trillions of degrees!  We had to shovel the
<br>
primordial plasma out to cool the place down.  But first we had to pound out
<br>
the fabric of spacetime to shovel it into.  Ahh, don't get me started.
<br>
<p>But those were the days!  Or, rather, they weren't---only after we cobbled
<br>
the sun together from spare particles did we get to have a day.  Later we had
<br>
to invent the concept of &quot;morning&quot; just to get up early in it.  You don't
<br>
know how easy you've got it.
