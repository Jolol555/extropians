<p>
<em>&gt;And THIS is exactly why libertarians won't ever be a real force in American
</em><br>
<em>&gt;politics. Almost universally every libertarian I know (including me, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time) comes off as a self-righteous know-it-all, acting as though 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everyone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is beneath them. We all seem to say &quot;If only they could see what we see, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they're not bright enough, so we'll have to make them do it anyway.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>You might want to reread my argument.  You're woefully misstating it. 
<br>
I proposed nowhere &quot;to make them do it anyway.&quot;  To the contrary, I 
<br>
talked about coincidental goals building a coalition of voters.  The 
<br>
more cerebral voters will probably appreciate the strong logic 
<br>
underlying everything, and the less cerebral will probably only be 
<br>
able to appreciate the shiny baubles that extend from that underlying 
<br>
logic.
<br>
<p>I'm basically saying to not turn away those voters just because they 
<br>
don't understand the bigger picture.  I'm also saying that if we're 
<br>
waiting for a plurality to understand the bigger picture, we're 
<br>
doomed.
<br>
<p>Take the Internet as an analogous example.  With the existence of 
<br>
cheap broadband, a lot of services become available that can help to 
<br>
push mankind's level of technology forward - services like: online 
<br>
databases of genes, tele-surgery demonstrations, massively parallel 
<br>
shared computing resources (SETI @Home), and just the general 
<br>
availability of scientific information.
<br>
<p>Did the cheap broadband become available because consumers wanted to 
<br>
use and fund these services?
<br>
<p>Of course not.  An extraordinarily minor amount of Internet traffic 
<br>
(and corresponding funding dollars) comes from such noble scientific 
<br>
endeavors.
<br>
<p>Most Internet broadband funding comes from people wanting to see 
<br>
porn, send email to their friends, trade mp3's, and check sports 
<br>
scores.
<br>
<p>Those more &quot;superficial&quot; uses of the Internet make it financially 
<br>
possible for the higher-level scientific work to occur.
<br>
<p>So, far from saying, &quot;people are stupid so we'll have to make them do 
<br>
it&quot;, I'm saying that we should take advantage of coincident goals 
<br>
where possible with voters of various intelligences, so that we can 
<br>
at least move things in overall the best direction.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
