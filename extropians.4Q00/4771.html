</em><br>
<p>Thanks everyone. Unfortunately, I can't take all the credit I'd like to (I
<br>
love credit!). A lot of this is not so much Jodie and I educating her, as
<br>
Morgana extracting information from us like a dentist does teeth (somehow
<br>
appropriate to this thread). My major goal with parenting Morgana is to make
<br>
sure she doesn't end up bitter and twisted; that could be very bad for
<br>
humanity...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regarding getting a microscope, you might want to consider the Intel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer microcam, I think it has a microscope &quot;attachment&quot;, however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure it would be sufficiently powerful to see bacteria.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably could do yeast which are ~10x bigger or some cyanobacteria
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you could find in pond water get pretty big.  You will need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go to 400x perhaps 1000x to see bacteria if I recall correctly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, bacteria being around a micron in size are at the limits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of far-field visible light microscopy because they are only slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger than the wavelengths in visible light (400-700 nm).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To view bacteria most effectively, they also need to be stained.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Standard microbiology uses an iodine stain, with an alcohol flush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; followed by a safranin stain to differentiate between gram negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and gram positive bacteria (they have different cell wall molecules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that have different stain affinities).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK, I'd better get some more info on this. I have a science degree, but not
<br>
the right kind of sciences; microscopes are almost as new to me as to her.
<br>
Sounds like fun, actually!
<br>
<p>Thanks very much Robert, and everyone else who replied. I think we'll have
<br>
some fun investigating this stuff.
<br>
<p>Here's an anecdote that will speak to Robert's condition... Last night, I
<br>
was downstairs working and my wife was putting the little guy to bed;
<br>
meanwhile, Morgana was watching a show called FAQ on tv, which has panels of
<br>
people talking about all kinds of science-related stuff, in a very hip, gen
<br>
x kinda way. There's a lot of &gt;H - related content on there actually, my
<br>
only quibble is that it's a bit superficial.
<br>
<p>Morgana came running in to Jodie, crying. After Jodie managed to calm her
<br>
down, Morgana explained that they'd said on the show that the sun was going
<br>
to explode and swallow the earth in 5 billion years. She was terrified! She
<br>
woke up in the night with nightmares about it.
<br>
<p>So today, I'm expounding at length on visions of colonising the stars,
<br>
jupiter brains, and all the rest. Also, we took some time to discuss just
<br>
how long 5 billion years is, finding out that we have a little time up our
<br>
sleeve after all.
<br>
<p>Still, she takes the threat seriously. When she found out about death, about
<br>
a year ago or more I think, I told her about life extension and what I think
<br>
will be happening in her life time, which she was very happy with. Since
<br>
then, she's been ruminating on that a lot. She told me this morning that
<br>
we'd probably be dead before the sun explodes, but we might not be.
