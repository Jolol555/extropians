<p><em>&gt; So I figured.  Thought he might have something better, though.  Did the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; search on myself, and there ain't much in the way of personal data.  One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could probably conclude I'm an Alcor member, though.
</em><br>
<p>I would not be surprized if anyone on this list, could contribute a suitcase
<br>
of data on myself, consdering my profound internet footprinting.
<br>
(challenge: say something about me, that isn't online or established
<br>
thru offlist emails)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It was amusing to find out that I made someones notable quotes page, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something I don't even remember writing on usenet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, I never had a vanity webpage, or filled out one of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;member profile&quot; things, so that probably helps.
</em><br>
<p>I have many that I do not advertise. (long forgotten ghosts)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Funny I had never thought of doing a search on myself, though.  Must be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blindspot.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; steve
</em><br>
<p>I'm so damn self referential that I have done this frequently.
<br>
It's actually a good idea to do this every now and then for security
<br>
reasons.
<br>
Remember the story of the girl who was murdered, and some guy had a
<br>
website about what he was going to do to her, previous to the crime? The
<br>
parents were told by investigators, that if they had punched in a search for
<br>
her name, they would have seen it, it was spidered through the search
<br>
engines.
<br>
Sadly, people had been to the site, and never contacted anyone about it.
<br>
<p>And now for something completely different,
<br>
I didn't think Zeb was Eliezer.
