<p><em>&gt; Actually, I was just thinking about your post, perhaps you are referring to

</em><br>
<p>Well, Im really uptight about this right now.  My mother is a retired CPA
<br>
and software developer from back before it was cool.  Now I am scared
<br>
shitless that she may be showing the early signs of Alzheimers.  This was
<br>
a bad week, but it might be because of a sudden stoppage of paxil.  She
<br>
was taking 40 mg a day for 5 years, stopped cold turkey.  Im hoping to
<br>
hell that is what was causing the problem.  Anybody who wants to can
<br>
jump in with encouraging words here, any time, offlist is fine, or otherwise.
<br>
<p>After watching my grandfather fade away with Alzheimers, I think that
<br>
the brain must have redundant circuits that somehow store memories
<br>
even after they cannot be retrieved.  In his late stages, he occasionally
<br>
had a good day, and was almost like his old self.  The next day he
<br>
wouldnt know his name.  Evidently that information was still in that
<br>
damaged mind, somewhere.  Had I known of cryonics at the time, I
<br>
would have tried to preserve that brain, hoping that all was not lost.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Emphysema? I imagine once we have gotten to the point of repairing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; externally of cryo, we could do the same in that situation.
</em><br>
<p>I think emphysema might be even worse than Alzheimers, since the
<br>
brain would suffer long term oxygen deprivation, not to mention the
<br>
horrifying last few weeks of the patient.  To force a person
<br>
thru that is simply outright cruelty, the worst evil that is being
<br>
forced upon us by the political establishment.  Fortunately, with
<br>
the decline in the number of smokers, emphysema is not as
<br>
big a risk as it once was.
<br>
<p>But Alzheimers is actually increasing.  Im hearing some encouraging
<br>
news coming from the medical community.  Please, medics, do hurry. spike
