<em>&gt; Mike,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Is there a name for that diet?  :))
</em><br>
<p>Dunno, its my own creation, and seems to be an ongoing freeform evolution. I've
<br>
dropped four inches off my waist in the last two months, and hopefully another
<br>
two inches by the time hunting season has ended at the end of November. My
<br>
condition up to this summer was primarily due to an excessive amount of sitting
<br>
on my arse the last few years, playing on computers.
<br>
I will say that I've also cut back on total intake as well, so a caloric
<br>
restriction diet does not neccessarily have to be vegan. I've been cycling
<br>
between meat intake on the weekends and just rice and protein drink during the
<br>
week when I don't get much chance to exercise, now that sunset is a 5pm
<br>
phenomena (and I'm not in the mood to deal with the traffic jams at the gym in
<br>
the evening) around here, my walking and running after work is curtailed.
<br>
<p>I will say this: If I were a vegetable, I'd eat a vegan diet. Since I'm an
<br>
animal (at least on weekends), I eat animals. In this sense, if you are a
<br>
computer addict and do not exercise, maybe a vegan diet is for you, or at least
<br>
a calorically restricted normal diet.
