<p>The story is actually more complicated than it appears on the 
<br>
surface.  This is NOT a story about implementing price caps which are 
<br>
doomed to fail.  This is actually a story about an attempt at 
<br>
deregulation that appears to have failed.  California actually 
<br>
deregulated the industry and predicted that free-market competition 
<br>
would make prices fall.  Instead, prices skyrocketed and 
<br>
price-gouging abounds.  After spiraling costs continued to grow 
<br>
out-of-control, the state decided to cap prices at their more 
<br>
reasonable levels.  The state basically is telling the deregulated 
<br>
companies that they must produce power cheaper than the state can 
<br>
produce its own power, or else they are pricing themselves out of the 
<br>
market.  This is how the free-market is supposed to work.
<br>
<p>What went wrong with deregulation?  Why did the deregulated companies 
<br>
not produce power cheaper than the regulated government monopoly? 
<br>
Because the deregulated industry was not really a free market.  The 
<br>
state of California was a captive marketplace which had to purchase 
<br>
the power by law.  There was no customer feedback to reject prices 
<br>
when they got too high.  Instead of high-priced companies losing 
<br>
market-share, this deregulated environment ensured market-share to 
<br>
all power producers no matter how high their prices got.  Naturally, 
<br>
prices kept going up and up with no end in sight.
<br>
<p>Basically, the new power companies did not try to work more 
<br>
efficiently or produce cheaper power than the previous monopoly did. 
<br>
Since they are producing a costlier product, the customer is 
<br>
switching back to the cheaper brand.  The state is not shutting down 
<br>
the new companies.  It is merely putting them on notice that it will 
<br>
no longer purchase high-priced power when it can produce its own 
<br>
power cheaper.  Only power that is priced at what the state feels is 
<br>
reasonable will be purchased by that customer.
<br>
<p>In this instance, the state of California seems to be acting like any 
<br>
other customer in a free-market environment.  They are limiting the 
<br>
price they are willing to pay, and they are switching from costly 
<br>
producers to more efficient producers.  Even when choosing between 
<br>
regulated and deregulated industries, the free market chooses the 
<br>
most efficient options.  Too bad the new companies deliberately chose 
<br>
profiteering over efficiency.
