<p><em> &gt; &gt; As nifty as these ideas are for a novel, assuming we could, why
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; would we possibly want to [create moreaus]?
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The easiest reason in the world: because the bad guys would already be doing
</em><br>
<em> &gt; it...
</em><br>
<p>This already assumes that there is some kind of economic or other
<br>
value attached to creating moreaus. Swann's scenario where most of
<br>
the moreaus seem to have been created as cheap supersoldiers doesn't
<br>
seem very plausible to me.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I just read _Forests of the Night_, which I am guessing is the second of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Moreau novels.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it's the first.
<br>
<p>#1 _Forests of the Night_
<br>
#2 _Emperors of the Twilight_
<br>
#3 _Specters of the Dawn_
<br>
<p>There's also the rather recent _Fearful Symmetries_, subtitled &quot;The
<br>
Return of Nohar Rajasthan&quot;, which I haven't read yet, but I guess
<br>
the subtitle says it all (i.e. it's a sequel to _Forests of the
<br>
Night_).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I've already read Swann's _Hostile Takeover_ trilogy, which occurs in the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; same universe, a hundred or two years later.
</em><br>
<p>It's really a single large novel, broken up into three volumes for
<br>
publishing reasons.  I don't want to recommend the Moreau novels in
<br>
an Extropian context, but _Hostile Takeover_, comprising
<br>
<p>#1 _Privateer_
<br>
#2 _Partisan_
<br>
#3 _Revolutionary_,
<br>
<p>is of some Extropian interest:
<br>
<p>- The setting is the anarchist planet of Bakunin, covered by a multitude
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of very different communes that only agree on one thing:  They don't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want a government.  Internally, the communes follow all kinds of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lifestyles and social organizations, and then some, but their external
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relations are as libertarian as you can get.
<br>
<p>- Nanotechnology has been banned after some unfortunate incidents
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the solar system (on the jovians?  I forgot).  Those are never
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detailed, but the implication is some gray goo type catastrophes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on Bakunin, which is outside the bounds of law and any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kind of government rule, there is a lone nanotechnology commune,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well-isolated and under explicit threat of being immediately
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nuked by the other communes should there be any incidents.  The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protagonist eventually visits the commune, which turns out to be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(in the terms of this mailing list) post-singularity.
<br>
<p>- AI has also been banned, though I have forgotten whether for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any inherent reasons or because it was a staple of The Race, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first alien species to mess with greater humanity.  For alien
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moral reasons, The Race tried to subvert human civilization
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without direct action--Terra returned the favor by sending some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warships, and that was it for The Race.  A surviving Race AI is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of the protagonists.
