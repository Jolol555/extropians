<em>&gt; &gt; Are there any good datasets or books on the subject? I would like to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfortunately most of the stuff I've read is by social scientists who take a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very hostile posistion on technologiacal determinism. 
</em><br>
<p>I don't see that as a problem. What interests me is the general
<br>
behavior of how technologies spread, not the exact whys and wherefores
<br>
of why technology A was adopted rather than tech B and if the reverse
<br>
could have been true (although that is interesting too).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've tried to argue that as we approach an era when we truly will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a technology that can determine it's own future surely some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elements of technological determinism must already have been at work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in human history.
</em><br>
<p>I would say there is a difference between technological determinism
<br>
and the existence of autonomous devices. There is a difference between
<br>
technology (the knowledge and practice base) and the agents that use
<br>
technology - even if they are a product of it.  The determinist
<br>
position essentially says technology will develop with no or little
<br>
influence from other aspects of society, economics, luck, individual
<br>
agents etc. If machines can self-develop, I would say they definitely
<br>
should be viewed as individual agents (and quite likely parts of
<br>
society, economy and politics, regardless of their formal status as
<br>
machines). 
<br>
<p>As an example, Eliezers self-transcending AI is not deterministic in
<br>
the technological determinism sense, what it does and what it becomes
<br>
is highly uncertain and likely quite sensitive to initial conditions
<br>
such as programmed core values. A technological determinist position
<br>
would be that once (say) AI has been developed certain other things
<br>
will by necessity be developed beyond that, regardless of the
<br>
circumstances of how AI came about. I don't buy that position - each
<br>
new technology enables many others, but which ones are implemented and
<br>
grow large depends on many other factors than just capability.
