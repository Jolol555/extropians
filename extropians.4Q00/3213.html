<p>For me it's rather the untethered connectivity (we'll need wireless
<br>
flatrate for that, though), GPS/digital map combo and augmented
<br>
reality. I've resubbed to <a href="mailto:wear-hard@haven.org?Subject=Re:%20Costs%20of%20diffraction%20gratings,%20was%20Re:%20human%20tetrachromate%20mutant%20reported&In-Reply-To=&lt;14890.13696.555946.272547@lrz.uni-muenchen.de&gt;">wear-hard@haven.org</a> a couple of weeks ago,
<br>
and there has been definitely progress going on. Perhaps I don't need
<br>
a classical laptop, after all ;)
<br>
<p>It would be interesting to see when digital camera people realize that
<br>
a few-megapixel (you've probably heard about Carver &quot;silicon retina&quot;
<br>
Mead's startup, <a href="http://www.foveon.net/">http://www.foveon.net/</a> ) digital camera with ieee 1394
<br>
(currently 400 MBps, that's twice the bandwidth of 640x480 true colour
<br>
30 fps) can sustainably deliver quite a few frames per second even
<br>
without compression. PAL/NTSC is obsolete as well as HDTV is a
<br>
stillbirth, we're obviously moving to flexible-format multimedia.
<br>
<p>The only astonishing thing is that most people don't seem to give a
<br>
damn.
