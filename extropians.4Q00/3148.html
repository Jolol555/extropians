<p><em>&gt; When I hear someone who is apparently educated and well-read make

</em><br>
<p>One thing I see a lot of people deeply involved with advances that are
<br>
as yet theoretical, rather than practically demonstratable, fail to
<br>
grasp is that those whose main concern is maintaining the present rather
<br>
than trying to create a better long-term future - the &quot;sheeple&quot;, as they
<br>
are commonly called (with reason) - typically understand demonstrations
<br>
of a superior new way much more than talk about same.  For some reason,
<br>
they can apparently understand and believe nightmare scenarios quite
<br>
well; perhaps it is because they see themselves as defending whatever
<br>
and whoever they care about against similar nightmares already.  But
<br>
positive dreams are something they do not seem to be able to grasp quite
<br>
so easily.  However, change the dream to reality, such that they can see
<br>
the new way and see the lack of any suggested disasters following the
<br>
new way around, and they can start to accept it as part of the reality
<br>
they defend.
<br>
<p>I wonder...if it is possible to pitch some of our dreams not as
<br>
improvements to the current condition per se, but improved ways of
<br>
defending what the masses generally agree on as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;wholesome&quot;
<br>
already, might that help spread the memes we wish to spread?  (For
<br>
example: eyeglass display linked to an AI that suggests information
<br>
related to whatever the wearer is talking about, and/or whatever someone
<br>
is talking to the wearer about.  Apply this to legal situations, where
<br>
the computer references laws related to topic of conversation, and
<br>
suggests questions to clarify points of law.  The EFF would be natural
<br>
beta testers, while non-tech groups like the ACLU might not hear about
<br>
this until well after the beta.  But what if the ACLU also beta tested,
<br>
and published a good review - or even just &quot;the computer did not try to
<br>
take over my brain; it was no worse than Bob the paperclip, and disposed
<br>
of as easily&quot;?  I suspect much faster market penetration, and thus
<br>
increased research funding for wearable - and, eventually, implantable -
<br>
computers, would be one result.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps the old saying about how new ideas win acceptance--the holders of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea paradigm simply die out, leaving the field open for the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --is completely correct.
</em><br>
<p>Among those who do not immediately embrace a new way (one that is
<br>
destined to become common practice, and thus be written about in history
<br>
from the viewpoint of those who follow it), there are those who will
<br>
accept some proof of the benefit of the change, and change.  There are
<br>
also those who do not, more of whom tend to be in power (because those
<br>
in power have more reason to not change, or at least they think they do)
<br>
and thus have more ability to restrict society-at-large's acceptance of
<br>
the new way.
