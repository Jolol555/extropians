<p>They don't deserve a say in their own future? Even as a jest, this is a
<br>
creepy implication, and one I have sometimes detected lurking beneath the
<br>
surface of many posts on this list (not to say brandished with big flashing
<br>
lights). [pre-emptive apologies to Brian; I do not mean that *he* is
<br>
creepy, just that the suggestion is]
<br>
<p>In reality, all sort of outcomes could follow. The bored or incompetent
<br>
could find it easiest to spoil their votes, thereby voiding their allegedly
<br>
worthless or malign opinions anyway. Or you might find an enhanced `donkey
<br>
vote' as it's called in Australia, where voters start at the top and number
<br>
down (in the silly non-preferential US system I assume that means the
<br>
candidate at the top of the ballot picks up the donkeys). But consider: in
<br>
Oz, where voting is compulsory and failure to turn out (even in bad
<br>
weather) attracts a fine, we tend to elect middle of the road standard
<br>
Western-style representatives. In the last election, all those thumb
<br>
sucking lottery besotted dolts voted in (by a small margin) a conservative
<br>
party, one that promised to reduce many social security benefits.
