<em>&gt; &lt;&gt; How much of a delta-v penalty does the STS pay in reaching that high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inclination?
</em><br>
<p>I don't exactly know, but here's a starting point:
<br>
<p>Using OV-103, basic cargo lift for due east from KSC (which is located
<br>
at 28.5 deg N) to 110
<br>
nm orbit was said to be 55,000 lbs (pre-Challenger figures). Subtract
<br>
about a ton from that for the post-Challenger firepole, etc.; this
<br>
brings us to a nominal 53,000 lbs to 110 nm.
<br>
<p>For the same altitude, subtract 500 pounds per degree of plane change,
<br>
according to an old page I found via Google:
<br>
<a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/archives/sts-72/shutref/sts_overview.html">http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/archives/sts-72/shutref/sts_overview.html</a>
<br>
. 
<br>
<p>ISS is as you know at 51.6 degrees, so based on that rule of thumb, we
<br>
are talking about a roughly -11,500 lb penalty just to get to a minimal
<br>
orbit at that inclination.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, I do not know what this translates to for a launch to the
<br>
same inclination, but 354 km up. I could work a rough guess with the
<br>
help of my old pal Kepler, but I'm too tired to be sure I'd done it
<br>
right. Anyone? Bueller?
<br>
<p>Anyway, as you no doubt know, the whole rationale for the 51.6-degree
<br>
orbit was so the Russkis (/Kazakhs) could do all the heavy lifting with
<br>
maximal payloads launched due east. Shuttle wasn't ever supposed to get
<br>
its nails dirty with cargo.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;&gt; Suppose someone actually uses the ISS for one of the primary original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purposes envisioned in the Original Plan, i.e. as a construction and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintenance base for further space infrastructure, such as a reusable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; translunar vehicle, planetary transit vehicles and the like.  How much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; penalty is imposed by its current orbit?
</em><br>
<p>Well, excluding the lift penalty, I think it is going to be damned
<br>
painful if you want to do a plane change near in--my gut says delta vee
<br>
in the several (3? 5?) miles per second range. So putting geostationary
<br>
comsats in service from ISS is A Bad Idea. 
<br>
<p>OTOH, flying single destination missions 'way out of the plane of the
<br>
ecliptic seems quite possible to me; if you want to, say, stroll around
<br>
the asteroid belt, you can do the plane change with an astute gravity
<br>
assist if you care to time it right. This is assuming current propulsion
<br>
tech. Lightsails or Orion (yeah, right!) change matters considerably, of
<br>
course.
<br>
<p>Some space industrialists say the most serious problem with the higher
<br>
inclination orbit is that the Shuttle can't spare the juice to nudge the
<br>
ETs into a parking orbit for later use as building blocks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;&gt; Suppose things change in the future and it makes sense to move the ISS to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a more equatorial orbit.  Will the propulsion system the final version will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have be able to make that move?
</em><br>
<p>That's up in the air, no pun intended. Since ISS is intended to be
<br>
boostable with a specific module that mates with the rest of the system,
<br>
there is no reason aside from money and politics why it couldn't. If
<br>
you're in a hurry, some parts of the Conestoga might flap in the breeze,
<br>
so to speak. And the moments of inertia on that collection of...
<br>
stuff... might make the control model a bit weird.
