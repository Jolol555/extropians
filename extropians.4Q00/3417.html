<em>&gt;     &gt; &quot;The Original&quot; is a reference to the accumulated movement of
</em><br>
a -particular-
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; pattern through time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok fine, but using that definition why can't &quot;The Original&quot; be &quot;The Copy&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why can't the pattern move from one to the other? For that matter, why
</em><br>
can't
<br>
<em>&gt; there be two &quot;Originals&quot; if pattern defines the concept as you say, after
</em><br>
all a
<br>
<em>&gt; pattern is made of information and information can be duplicated.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but you'll note my emphasis of the word &quot;particular.&quot;  As it stands, MY
<br>
discrete experience of reality is contained within a -particular- pattern.
<br>
Unless you are proposing a means by which that particular discrete reality
<br>
experiencer is able to transition to a new substrate, *I* (by definition)
<br>
will not be thrilled with the copy process.  The copy process could fail and
<br>
the results would be identical with respect to the perspective of the
<br>
original discrete reality experiencer-- and again, at this point, that's the
<br>
only perspective that matters to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; Only because you've killed the insider.  A fine solution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes I think  it's a fine solution too because there is no injured party.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Death means having a last thought and in this case you didn't have one,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your thoughts went on uninterrupted.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that's sort of a fast and loose definition of death, but I can safely
<br>
adopt it in this context because I don't differentiate in the same way
<br>
between the thinker and the thoughts.  Further, its difficult to even call
<br>
the new pattern MY thoughts, since they are discrete from the original.
<br>
What if you were to make 10 copies?  Would they all be my thoughts?  Of
<br>
course not.  They would each be their own divergent reality experiencer and
<br>
would have necessarily discrete and original identities.
<br>
<p>I think its safe to say that we represent a pattern with sufficient
<br>
complexity to support all sorts of interesting emergent properties.  One of
<br>
those properties is what I can call the higher brain experiencer (simply to
<br>
divorce it from other psychological mish-mash.)  You cannot expect that this
<br>
discrete entity is going to make any sort of transition should you choose to
<br>
copy the human matrix as you would software.  You -will- have pleasing and
<br>
effective results if the copying resolution is fine-grained enough-- I don't
<br>
dispute that.  But should you leave the 'original' intact, you now have TWO
<br>
discrete experiencers-- if not, one of the higher brain experiencers has had
<br>
his/her existence terminated.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;My particular pattern does not have a contiguous experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by contiguous experience but your subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience is certainly continuous, I could make a copy of you, destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The Original&quot; wait a thousand years and then activate &quot;The Copy&quot; and
</em><br>
you'd
<br>
<em>&gt; never notice any interruption, at least not until you looked at the
</em><br>
external world.
<br>
<p>How are you transferring my subjective experience of reality across the two
<br>
humans?  If you don't destroy the original, do I somehow get to experience
<br>
both realities simultaneously in a single brain?  The mere act of creating a
<br>
copy does nothing to preserve the continuity of my subjective experience--
<br>
you could create such a copy covertly and I, unawares, could walk out onto
<br>
the street and get hit by a bus-- does my subjective experience then
<br>
mysteriously jump across to the clone?
<br>
<p>Let us suppose that you make a copy of me.  Dazed by the copying process, I
<br>
slip out of the &quot;termination chamber&quot; and go home and go to bed.  The copy
<br>
wakes up.  It thinks its me.  You think its me.  Is it me?  Or am I now
<br>
slowly dozing off to a bad Saturday Night Live episode?  Realizing that I've
<br>
slipped out, you tell the copy to go to bed and you send an assassin over to
<br>
my house.  He sneaks in and kills me while I sleep.  The copy wakes up in
<br>
the morning in the lab.  NOW is it me?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;     &gt;and  frankly, I couldn't care less (literally: couldn't) if my
</em><br>
identical copy is
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;happy with how things turned out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're wrong, I know for a fact you do care because you see you are that
</em><br>
copy,
<br>
<em>&gt; I just made you 10 seconds ago.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that's fine 'cause *I* am the copy, so obviously I'm happy with how
<br>
things turned out.  I'm not so sure about that dude that you killed 10
<br>
seconds ago...
<br>
<p>Or did you really kill him?  Maybe he's off doing something else-- if so,
<br>
I'm sure he's not confusing himself for me.
