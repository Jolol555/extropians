<br>
Interesting, but long read for you - &quot;Unintended Consequences&quot; by John Ross.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This was a former CIA type, was it not? A falling out amongst thieves!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I suppose no &quot;middle eastern&quot; types were ever CIA operatives or moles?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;It's funny how it becomes a &quot;cult&quot; because HCI needs to make their point,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, David Koresh WAS forbidding couples to have sex, and arrogating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mating privileges, complete with beer and rock guitar, to himself for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pretty wives and nubile girls (13 and up).  That kinda sexual control

</em><br>
<em>&gt;child abuse.  However, they should've arrested him outside the compound 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when they had the chance.
</em><br>
<p>I could never understand how anyones, no matter how weird, religious 
<br>
beliefs were any business of the federal govt. - let alone a taxing body 
<br>
like the BATF. THe highest got. agency that should have been interested was 
<br>
maybe the state child welfare people. Besides, the US is NOT a democracy - 
<br>
it's a constitutional republic. Small difference, mostly lost on our 
<br>
present &quot;leaders&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's still a good point; it's better to have the police better armed than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the criminals, rather than the other way around.  We Floridians saw way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;too much of the other way during the Cocaine Cowboy '80's.
</em><br>
<p>Back then, how many regular people were doing the shooting? And how many of 
<br>
the shooters bought their guns at Wal-Mart?
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I'd rather that school guards (and bank guards, as well) be fit and well 
</em><br>
trained instead of obese or frail geezers supplementing their 
<br>
retirement.  I do NOT want teachers armed in class, &gt; any more than I want 
<br>
school guards teaching english composition, physics or chemistry; I'd much 
<br>
rather leave each profession to its respective professionals.
<br>
<p>Reasonable point. Teachers should not be acting as armed guards. We need a 
<br>
paradigm shift in teaching, anyway. Maybe take the whole business away from 
<br>
govt. and put it in the hands of private businesses who would be answerable 
<br>
to their customers - the students and parents?
<br>
<p>Still, if a teacher carries protection for personal use, why should they be 
<br>
disarmed just because of the present location? The bad guys won't play by 
<br>
the rules - so there is NO truly safe place where such restrictions would 
<br>
make sense.
<br>
<p>We've had metal detectors and airport style wand frisks at Chicago schools 
<br>
for quite a while - the little angels still manage to bring in guns. 
<br>
There's no solution past totally nude education that can stop all the 
<br>
contraband at the door. Hey - now there's a new paradigm - but, thinking 
<br>
back on some of my teachers, maybe not - wouldn't want to scare the kids!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;| There is one I've heard of; I think it was the Pearl, Mississippi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;shooting, where an assistant principal had a gun.  Here in Pensacola, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;had a teacher's car broken into in the school |parking lot and her gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;stolen.  Walking around 180 days a year arould a thousand little hands with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;your piece on your hip is not a good idea for most teachers either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Yep, that's one. Another was a hall owner who stopped a student with a gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from shooting a group of kids at the hall. He had a shotgun behind the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;counter. Ohio, if I am not mistaken.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hadn't heard about that one.  know any more about it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Metal lockboxes are available for auto use - they bolt through the floor,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and are virtually theftproof unless the thief has a torch or cutoff saw.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Responsible gun owners don't leave weapons unsecured in a vehicle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Admittedly, carrying a gun is not for everyone. But what about the &quot;Officer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Friendly&quot; who comes in armed and ready? Perhaps we should teach the kids
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from kindergarten on about gun safety. Namely - NRA's Eddie Eagle - &quot;Don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Touch! Leave the area! Tell an adult!&quot;. Give them a fighting chance. As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;long as there are guns, there's a risk. We teach them about STDs...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Eddie Eagle's message tends to glamorize gun ownership as a badge of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adulthood and coolness, with a cartoon character to hook the message, much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as Joe Camel did for tobacco.  Kids should know not to touch guns, and to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tell a responsible adult about guns they find, but a child safety program 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cannot substitute for adult responsibility, only supplement it, and I have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concerns about a propagandized 'NRA Youth&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Have you actually seen the materials? There's not much glory there. It's a 
<br>
safety message - not a &quot;how to&quot; book. NRA has programs for kids, too, but 
<br>
their parents have to seek them out.
<br>
<p>Eddie Eagle does not carry a gun - quite unlike Joe Camel, who was almost 
<br>
never without a coffin nail.
<br>
<p>Check out an NRA affiliated rifle range some time. They tend to be pretty 
<br>
anal about gun safety - to the point where it gets irritating sometimes.
<br>
<p>How did the NRA get to be such a devil, anyway? NRA was founded to provide 
<br>
a pool of marksmen for our country in time of need, similar to Amateur 
<br>
Radio's goal of a pool of trained radio operators. Hunting and other uses 
<br>
are just ways of keeping up the skill a people's militia needs. It wasn't 
<br>
until Congress started overstepping its' powers with the NFA and GCA of 
<br>
1968 that the NRA, quite correctly, started to lobby against these stupid laws.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; 5,285 kids (under 19) are a lot to lose in a year.  That's just the US, 
</em><br>
and the combined totals of great britain, france, germany, canada and japan 
<br>
for that year is 338.  And for every &gt;child killed four are 
<br>
wounded.  According to the Centers for Disease Control, the rate of firearm 
<br>
death of children 0-14 years old is nearly twelve times higher in the U.S. 
<br>
than in 25 other &gt;industrialized nations combined.  Over 6,000 students 
<br>
were expelled in 1996-97 for bringing guns to school. The Journal of the 
<br>
American Medical Association reports that between
<br>
<em>&gt;36% and 50% of male eleventh graders believe they could easily get a gun 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if they wanted one.  Guns do kill people, especially when wielded by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;children. More than 800 Americans, young and old, die each year from guns 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shot by children under the age of 19.  In 1996, more than 1300 children 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aged 10-19 committed suicide with firearms. Unlike suicide attempts using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other methods, suicide attempts with gun are nearly always fatal, meaning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a temporarily depressed teenager will never get a second chance at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life.  Two-thirds of all completed teenage suicides involve a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;firearm.  The firearm injury epidemic, due largely to handgun injuries, is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ten times larger than the polio epidemic of the first half of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;century.  As the rate of American gun violence dramatically increased over 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the last fifteen years, American children paid the price.  From 1984 to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1994 the firearm death rate for 15-19 year olds increased 222% while the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-firearm homicide death rate decreased almost 13%.  Within fi!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ve years, firearms are expected to overtake motor vehicle accidents as the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leading cause of death among American children.
</em><br>
<p>Are the '!'s the email server's way of telling us to limit paragraph size? 
<br>
They crop up in lots of posts from this server...
<br>
<p>Most of the kids killed or hurt by guns have no training past TV and 
<br>
movies. The easy availability is due to the war on drugs and the associated 
<br>
black market. I was pointing out that you rarely hear of &quot;gun violence&quot; in 
<br>
rural areas, the few high school incidents aside. It's primarily an urban 
<br>
phenomena.
<br>
<p>The numbers for drowning are still higher than for guns, especially with 
<br>
the younger kids. Pools and toilets are not necessary for the defense of a 
<br>
free society, but no one is agitating for more laws concerning them!
<br>
<p>Personally, I believe a suicide should be allowed to do his or her own 
<br>
thing, if they are in that much pain. It's horrible for the friends and 
<br>
family, but probably a good thing for the species.
<br>
<p>Gun injuries have been dropping through the last decade. The antis use this 
<br>
to point out how well their laws work, and then point out the &quot;increases&quot; 
<br>
to prove the need for more laws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Stupid, well-meaning laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They'll most likely save a lot more lives than they lose; if people are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gonna sue either way, there will be many more suits for many more deaths 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without such laws.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that a locked-up gun is totally useless for defense. If the 
<br>
kids are educated, they don't touch. I lived with my Dad's Colt service 
<br>
revolver for my entire life at home - and I NEVER touched the gun. I was 
<br>
taught from age three on that real guns are not toys. I DID have toy guns - 
<br>
and I well knew the difference, as my Dad took me to the police range to 
<br>
watch practice a number of times.
<br>
<p>To save bandwidth, I am going to address a few points from another of your 
<br>
posts:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;The term &quot;assault weapon&quot; was coined by the HCI types. It has no legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;definition, and no military rifle is ever called an &quot;assault weapon&quot; by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;military. Any weapon - gun, knife, or club - can be an &quot;assault weapon&quot; if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it is used in an attack.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It has an official definition in California state law. See:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.handguncontrol.org/facts/ib/assault.asp">http://www.handguncontrol.org/facts/ib/assault.asp</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at the end of the issue brief.
</em><br>
<p>HCI wrote the definition, softheads like Feinstein accepted it. The 
<br>
ignorant leading the stupid. Whenever I hear of &quot;law&quot; like this, I just 
<br>
remember &quot;The law is an ass&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Actually, handguns and shotguns are better for close range home 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protection. Rifles are intended for medium to long-range fire, or for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rapid firefight spray if they are semiauto or auto.
</em><br>
<p>The very weapons HCI wants to eliminate first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The 2nd amendment was meant to keep 'well-regulated militias' armed, to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protect the states charged with regulating them against the encroachment 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of federal power, a protection that was proven useless by the Civil war. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Today's national guards (the heirs to state-regulated militias) store 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their weapons in armories. The NRA has never challenged a gun law on 2nd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amendment grounds, as they know that it wouldn't fly; the appeal to it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a device to inflame emotions.
</em><br>
<p>The National Guard is under the control of the very people that the 
<br>
original militia's creators wanted to be able to guard against. Having 
<br>
weapons meant to defend the people against the govt. locked up in the 
<br>
govt's storehouse seems pretty silly to me, not to mention dangerous for 
<br>
the people.
<br>
<p>One of my biggest problems with the NRA is their unwillingness to go 
<br>
head-to-head with a 2AM court challenge. I have written them a number of 
<br>
times requesting less rhetoric and more action, to no avail. That's why I 
<br>
have joined a number of other organizations such as Gun Owners of America 
<br>
and Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;In 1994, a leading law enforcement executive characterized semi-automatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;assault weapons as nothing more than &quot;cop-killer guns,&quot; and at that time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;assault weapons accounted for more than 17% of fatal shootings of police.)
</em><br>
<p>The Uzis and such are pretty useless against standard police body armor. 
<br>
Rifles of any caliber over .22 can take out a vested person easily, unless 
<br>
the vest is an inch thick.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Semiautos can kill a lot more people dead a lot quicker. No real hunter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sprays game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Tec-9's, Uzis and Mac-11's are definitely less suited for hunting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purposes than AR-15's, AK's and SKS's, but accurate hunting rifles do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need a rapid fire capacity if the hunter is good enough to be out there. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If he isn't, rapid-fire spray is a danger to other hunters.
</em><br>
<p>True. But hunting rifles sometimes are semiauto - if, for instance, you are 
<br>
hunting boar, and are charged after firing your one shot, you are in 
<br>
trouble. Ditto for moose and elk. If you are good, a bolt action can be 
<br>
fired almost as quickly as a true autoloader.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Stupid laws like the &quot;assault weapon&quot; ban are just incremental gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;prohibition - especially if the definition of &quot;assault weapon&quot; continues to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;mutate, like in California.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Actually, what mutated were the guns. The manufacturers produced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cosmetically altered copycat versions specifically designed to circumvent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the ban while retaining the desired rapid-fire characteristics, and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;law was amended to cover them.
</em><br>
<p>Not really. California continuously changes the rules, and has no 
<br>
compunction about confiscation. Many people who registered their SKSs found 
<br>
out the hard way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It's not much of a stretch to include all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;weapons with barrels shorter than 16&quot; as &quot;assault weapons&quot; - then ALL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;handguns are gone, and with them the possibility that women, invalids, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;handicapped persons just might be able to defend themselves against 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I do not subscribe to the slippery slope domino theory, and would not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;support such action. I do believe that we should all be willing to take 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;responsible measures to keep military-style semiautomatic rifles from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;flooding the civilian market, while preserving the right of sane and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;law-abiding adults to purchase shotguns, long guns designed for hunting, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and handguns designed for home protection.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, states like California, Maryland, Connecticut, and 
<br>
Massachusetts are actively building ramps and greasing them. Illinois is 
<br>
not far behind, at least in C(r)ook County.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I also do not advocate gun registration, but rather people registration; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the maintainence of a purchase-prohibited list that must be referenced by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;background check prior to a sale. I CAN see the point in a short waiting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;period, until all the records that need to be accessed are made instantly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accessible. There are also such things as 'crimes of passion' and 'jealous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rages'; but I cannot see preventing a sane and law-abiding adult from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;immediately buying a means of personal protection, although I would also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hope that they would call the police.
</em><br>
<p>Now we are in agreement almost totally.
<br>
<p>An interesting note:
<br>
Right at this moment - the radio is quoting how Cook County Sheriff Sheahan 
<br>
is recalling 5000 free gun locks he was handing out - they can be opened by 
<br>
a hard blow. When he issued the locks a week ago, the antis hailed this 
<br>
&quot;sensible&quot; move - now they are claiming it was all a publicity stunt by the 
<br>
wacko gun nuts.
