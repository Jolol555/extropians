Hal and I are actually more in agreement than not. I am not against all
<br>
blinding fogs. I might be, some day, but right now I'm not.
<br>
<p>Like Michael Lorrey, Hal seems to think I am conflating individualism
<br>
with pathology. I am not: I am saying that at any given instant, my
<br>
judgement of whether you are bad-crazy is a function of how much I trust
<br>
you. If I have confidence that I share values with you, I am more easily
<br>
persuaded that you are just expressing yourself, not about to do harm to
<br>
me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The mantra you mention is far from valueless to me. Please don't make me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your enemy just yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem with &quot;I am a member of a civilization&quot; is that it doesn't say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether the civilization is good or bad.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is true that, taken by itself, then notion is so boiled down as
<br>
to be too value free. How about &quot;I am a member of an increasingly
<br>
enlightened planetary civilization&quot;? Welp, it sounds awful prissy and
<br>
NWO; besides, the Nazis probably thought that too.
<br>
<p>Brin doesn't want the Reichstag, he just wants a day a year and some
<br>
time once in a while spent on reflecting on how far we've come with the
<br>
imperfect systems we have. I do grant you that a new Goebbels, or even
<br>
David Duke, could easily twist the mantra into &quot;Ein volk...&quot; with no
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p>Real mantras are safer, you just say them for the sound while you
<br>
meditate. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Principles *are* important. One principle that's important is not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; burn the barn down while the horse is still inside.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't follow what that means in this context.
</em><br>
<p>It's an old saw that cuts both ways. In this case, I meant that
<br>
premature polarization (enemy talk) can cost you. Brin might not be as
<br>
useful to your goals as an enemy as he might be as a grudgingly
<br>
respected gadfly with whom you have piquant disagreement.
