<em>    &gt; two instances.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not dodging the issue, I said as clearly as I know how to that if it's digital it's
<br>
the same thing.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;is your definition relevant only to  humans?
</em><br>
<p>What do you think, an ameba hasn't had a first thought so it can't worry much
<br>
about having a last.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Your contention is that there is a one or two second period in which both
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;entities would, in fact, be basically one?  Why?
</em><br>
<p>Because their brains would be operating in the same manner. If 2 phonographs
<br>
are playing the same song then 2 songs are not playing. If a copy is made of
<br>
me then there are two indistinguishable things, but if &quot;I&quot; is a adjective and not
<br>
a noun then there can still be one &quot;I&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; You appear to making the claim that my copies are not discrete-- that there
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; is some sort of shared experience across the entities.  I'm asking for the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; scientific basis by which you hold this belief.
</em><br>
<p>I perform experiments. I make a copy of Jason Joel Thompson and put him in a
<br>
environment identical to the original Jason Joel Thompson and see it their behavior is
<br>
similar. I ask the copy who he is and see if he says Jason Joel Thompson.  If the
<br>
copy says &quot; Oh my god I'm a zombie! I can still  do pretty well on IQ tests, I can still
<br>
earn a good living, I have friends, I laugh and cry just like anybody else, but really
<br>
I'm no more conscious than a rock. &quot; then you're right and I'm wrong.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Space is a BIG issue with regards to consciousness
</em><br>
<p>Trying to develop a theory of consciousness based on position is a bad idea.
<br>
Where does consciousness exist? If it's inside my head why don't I understand
<br>
what it's like to float in a liquid encased in a dome made of bone? I assure you
<br>
I don't know what that's like, and I sure don't feel that's where &quot;I&quot; am. Feeling and
<br>
thinking is what consciousness is all about so that pretty much ends the matter
<br>
as far as I'm concerned. Where does &quot;old&quot; exist? Where does &quot;fast&quot; exist?
<br>
Where does the number &quot;11&quot; exist? Where does consciousness exist?
<br>
These questions have no answer because they  make no sense
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;My brain is separate from yours-- we have  differing experiences of reality.
</em><br>
<p>If our brains were identical then we would have an identical experience of reality.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Your logic is fraying.  Let's try a little diagram. [...]
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps it's my fault but I found you're questions elliptical and unclear, and there
<br>
were 12 of them! The diagrams didn't help. Rather than answer such questions
<br>
let me try to clarify my position with a thought experiment I sent to the list a few
<br>
years ago.
<br>
<p>An exact duplicate of the earth, and it's entire ecosystem, is created
<br>
a billion light years away. The duplicate world would need some sort of
<br>
feedback mechanism to keep the worlds in synchronization, non linear effects
<br>
would amplify tiny variations, even quantum fluctuations, into big differences,
<br>
but this is a thought experiment so who cares. In the first two cases below the
<br>
results would vary according to personalities, remember there's a lot of illogic
<br>
even in the best of us.
<br>
<p>1) I know all about the duplicate world and you put a 44 magnum to my head
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tell me in ten seconds you will blow my brains out, am I concerned?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You bet I am because I know that your double is holding an identical gun
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the head of my double and making an identical threat.
<br>
<p>2) I find out that for the first time since the Big Bang the worlds will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diverge, in 10 seconds you will put a bullet in my head but my double will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be spared, am I concerned? Yes, and angry as well, in times of intense
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stress nobody is very logical. My double is no longer exact because I am
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going through a traumatic experience and my double is not. I'd be looking
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at that huge gun and wondering what it will be like when it goes off and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if death will really be instantaneous. I'd be wondering if my philosophy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was really as sound as I thought it was and I'd also be wondering why I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get the bullet and not my double and cursing the unfairness of it all.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My (semi) double would be thinking &quot;it's a shame about that other fellow
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I'm glad it's not me&quot;.
<br>
<p>3) I know nothing about the duplicate world, a gun is at both our heads and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we both are convinced we are going to die. One gun goes off, making a hell
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a mess, but the other gun, for inexplicable reasons misfires. In this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case NOBODY died and except for undergoing a terrifying experience I am
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;completely unharmed. The real beauty part is that I don't even have to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clean up the mess.
<br>
<p>The bottom line is we don't have thoughts and emotions, we are thoughts and
<br>
emotions, and the idea that the particular hardware that is rendering them
<br>
changes their meaning is as crazy as my computer making the meaning of your
<br>
post different from what it was on yours.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;why -should- time be a factor?  If the copy REALLY is you, and you
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;get hit by the bus 60 seconds later, then all you've lost is 60 seconds.
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;You had a 60 second old back-up made.  Yes, there IS a minute of subjective
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;experience lost to the mists of antiquity, but, hey, Two isn't going to know
</em><br>
<p>And two won't care, but one probably will, I can't give you a logical reason why
<br>
because I can't give you a logical reason why life is better than death, it's just
<br>
a matter of taste.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;You seem to  think that if we kill One -instantaneously- when we make Two,
</em><br>
<em>     &gt; its okay, but  if One dies -later- that's a bad thing.
</em><br>
<p>Right.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;By that logic, we should ALWAYS  KILL ONE (at the moment of copying)
</em><br>
<p>Right.
<br>
<p><em>      &gt;I am not -just- information.
</em><br>
<p>True, atoms are essential, but information is what makes you different from me
<br>
because atoms are generic.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt; Are two separate hydrogen molecules the same hydrogen molecule?
</em><br>
<p>Actually Richard Feynman developed a theory that there was only one
<br>
electron in the universe, but for the purposes of this discussion I'm willing
<br>
to concede that there are 2 hydrogen atoms, but they are indistinguishable.
<br>
You may think that you can find a difference in them, because one is here
<br>
and the other one is way over there,  but can't really because there is no
<br>
way of knowing if the particles are changing positions.  Try the experiment.
<br>
Switch the position of the two hydrogen atoms and you find that the state of the
<br>
system remains identical,  the two could be instantaneously changing position
<br>
and there would be no way two tell and no reason to care.
<br>
<p>Time for another thought experiment, me and my exact copy and standing an
<br>
equal distance from the center of a perfectly symmetrical room. A mad scientist
<br>
presses the button on a magic machine that he claims will instantaneously exchange
<br>
my brain with that of my exact copy. He presses the button but I notice absolutely no
<br>
difference, he says &quot;that's because the senses of the ordinal and the copy were sending
<br>
the same signals to whatever brain happened to be in it's head&quot;. You are also present
<br>
armed with CAT scans and MRI's and EEG's and high speed cameras and lots of other
<br>
good stuff, but you can find no change when he presses the button either.
<br>
Our loony friend says &quot;that's because the two brains were identical, but really there was a
<br>
huge change, I mean, after all, I exchanged the brains&quot;. I maintain that absolutely nothing
<br>
is happening, not objectively and not subjectively, and if there is any difference between
<br>
this madman and a charlatan the difference is too small to be measured.
