I was wondering if anyone else had run into this book.
<br>
When I read it I found it to be somewhat disturbing (I guess I don't like to
<br>
have my beliefs(tm) attacked either), the thing that struck me most was the
<br>
combination of the assumed superiority of socialism and the 'True Knowledge'
<br>
which seems to translate as 'If I have the power to do something it's OK to do
<br>
it'.
<br>
I really don't see either of these ideas taking off, socialism is a proven
<br>
failure and might is right doesn't seem very appealing to the members of this
<br>
list, the people that seem most likely to be in a position to take advantage of
<br>
the tech that would make that scenario possible.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; find any mention of it in the archives at <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though I think I recall some discussion here once.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was well written (or maybe it had been too long since I'd read SF and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed a fix).  People like us are clearly the bad guys in the book, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was interesting to see what our worse crimes are from MacLeod's perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MacLeod seems to favor some sort of socialist society, though he was never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very clear how it worked.  He is, however, able to depict an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anarcho-capitalist society, and it isn't a terrible place -- just culturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backward and unsophisticated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **** SPOILER WARNING - I'm going to say what happens! ****
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The people in his socialist society think uploads are just machines without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any inner life worth considering, but the main character of the book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually get temporarily uploaded and then realizes that she is wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems that according to MacLeod, our great crime is selfishness. When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth was in bad shape, the people in space split into two factions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;beautiful people&quot; who had lots of sex and wanted to help Earth, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;outwarder&quot; nerds who only cared about conquering the universe for selfish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glory.  At some point the outward faction violently grabs a bunch of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources, kills lots of the others, and uploads more of them to serve as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slaves.  They go off to Jupiter, take apart a moon, create millions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upload copies to do their dirty work, become huge million-mind-equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures, and build a wormhole.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They then get stuck in virtual reality navel-gazing, and broadcast viruses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that destroy all computers and telecom on Earth, forcing Earth to from then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on use mechanical computers and no radio. Earth folk are about to destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them all, but then try to talk, and find creatures on Jupiter that seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable.  Earth asks them to stop the viruses, and asks them to explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to use the wormhole to get to a distant colony of anarcho-capitalists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the Jupiter folk do both.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many groups in the anarcho-capitalist colony then decide they want trade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Jupiter and send ships there through the wormhole, ignoring Earth-folk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warnings about the viruses.  Viruses from somewhere on Jupiter then take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over those ships, which is then a justification for killing all life/mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Jupiter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So MacLeod's bottom line is that we're right about that technologies like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading and wormholes and anarcho-capitalism can work as envisioned, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that our selfishness will do us in.  It makes us get stuck in navel-gazing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and when we are powerful it makes us so irresistibly grabby that others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will get together to kill us all.  When we stay as weak humans we create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies that work, but are culturally unsophisticated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose the image is similar to that of the Ferengi in Star Trek NG,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;ugly, greedy and sexist&quot; traders -- useful to have around, but not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort you'd want to socialize with, or have sex with, and definitely not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sort you'd want to allow to have substantial power.  Which if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think about it is the stereotype of the nerd.  And all this fits with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my theories of why people don't like cryonics, and why they aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thrilled with our becoming superhuman.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately these stereotypes do have a basis in reality.  People
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this list do on average give the impression to outsiders of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less sexy, less culturally sophisticated, more selfish, and more caring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about things and stuff out there than people around here.  And ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people do seem to have deeply ingrained fears of letting such people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My response to all this is not to deny stereotypes regarding values,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but to deny that the facts will make them very relevant.  The common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SF scenario is a small group of people who have a huge influence over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history and society, usually via their access to technology, and whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values are pivotal to the outcome.  But this has almost never happened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the past, and isn't likely to happen in the future either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most change is due to large broad social forces, and organizations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large enough to have substantial power over others are controlled by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coalitions of many types of people, with many types of values.  SF
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenarios where a few nerds could take over the world with the tech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (AI, nanotech, wormhole, etc.) that they develop in their obscure lab
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are just fantasy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Selfish techie nerds are and will remain largely powerless, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if all the changes we forsee and promote come to pass.  We may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pivotal in making people pay attention to these possibilities, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they happen after that it will be because of social forces and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widely shared values - our differing values won't matter much.
