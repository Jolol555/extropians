<em>&gt; I do see the force of the claim, but it might still be wrong, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emergence of effective AI might, after all, depend on ramping up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrate technologies by brute force via Moore's law.

<p>Emergence of AI will depend, I think, on heuristics and programming. More than
<br>
half the humans on Earth have IQs in the 100 range or above, but only a tiny
<br>
percentage of humans can do calculus. This means the bottleneck is in the
<br>
software, not the hardware. It's easy to breed Homo sapiens, but difficult to
<br>
teach them to run factories, design space shuttles, and write code. Similarly,
<br>
supercomputers can outperform humans in raw computing power, but no one yet
<br>
knows how to teach them to learn on their own. Recent research indicates that it
<br>
may well happen that massively parallel neurocomputers will figure out for
<br>
themselves how to learn what they need in order to be considered
<br>
human-competitive AI.

&quot;We are looking into principles of learning and self-organization that allow a
<br>
system to develop and become intelligent by itself. A major premise in biology
<br>
is that there is structure in the world and this structure is recognized by the
<br>
brain. Based on this structure, the brain can bootstrap itself, through learning
<br>
and self-organization, to become better and better.
<br>
&quot;This is the process that we would like to understand. It's clear this can't
<br>
happen from nothing, so what must be happening is that the genome is giving us
<br>
some information about how to learn -- what the right learning algorithms are
<br>
for the problems that the system is facing. And we have to figure out what the
<br>
basic ideas or these biases are which come from the genetic coding. But from
<br>
there onward we believe that the brain can self-organize.
<br>
&quot;this is a different way of thinking. It is basically, in the end, a huge neural
<br>
network that self-organizes automatically to reach this level of intelligence
<br>
and competence that we see in biological systems.&quot;
