<p>
Bearing in mind Max's plea to go light on the 
<br>
conventional political discussion, I'm forwarding
<br>
this piece by my friend Jim Bennett, an 
<br>
American journalist friend, a libertarian, living
<br>
in England.  
<br>
<p>I'd never thought of the College in parliamentary
<br>
terms...

<br>
election special by UPI

<br>
<p>A MODEST PROPOSAL FOR THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE
<br>
<p>Now that we are facing the possibility of a winner of
<br>
the popular vote
<br>
being the loser in the Electoral College, we will have
<br>
yet another round
<br>
of proposals to eliminate this constitutional &quot;relic&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;It is true that
<br>
the Electoral College does not function today as the
<br>
Founding Fathers
<br>
had expected it to.  Then again, our lungs evolved
<br>
from a fish’s swim
<br>
bladder, but we don’t hear any suggestions that we
<br>
stop using them just
<br>
because we don’t use them for their original purpose.
<br>
<p>I would hold that this election demonstrated, rather,
<br>
the usefulness of
<br>
the Electoral College.   The razor-thin popular vote
<br>
balance is
<br>
converted into a definitive victory.  If we were
<br>
electing the President
<br>
by a popular vote, we might be finding ourselves
<br>
facing a nationwide
<br>
recount that could take weeks, and accompanied by
<br>
lawsuits in dozens of
<br>
jurisdictions arguing that this or that practice or
<br>
action invalidated
<br>
the entire vote.  Under this system we know that only
<br>
Florida’s vote is
<br>
worth re-examining.
<br>
<p>But since we will be discussing changing the system,
<br>
maybe it’s worth
<br>
examining the proposition that the Electoral College
<br>
does not have too
<br>
much power, but rather too little.  During the course
<br>
of this election,
<br>
I was explaining the function of the College to my
<br>
English wife.  I
<br>
described it to her as a sort of special-purpose
<br>
Parliament that, as in
<br>
the English parliamentary system, met to confirm the
<br>
national leader.
<br>
Unlike Parliaments, however, it did not continue to
<br>
meet.  Electors,
<br>
like bees, sting once and then sting no more.
<br>
<p>Then this got me to thinking.  Why shouldn’t the
<br>
Electoral College
<br>
continue to function after it ratifies the
<br>
Presidential choice?  After
<br>
all, it is a rarity in the American political system,
<br>
because like a
<br>
Parliament, it cannot by definition be controlled by a
<br>
different party
<br>
than the President’s.  Perhaps we can take advantage
<br>
of this somehow.
<br>
<p>Just in the past Presidential term we saw one possible
<br>
use for such a
<br>
body.  All three exercises in use of the impeachment
<br>
power against the
<br>
President, the cases of Andrew Johnson, Nixon, and
<br>
Clinton, suffered
<br>
from the mix of judicial and political considerations
<br>
in the process,
<br>
and the fact that the impeaching body was in all cases
<br>
controlled by the
<br>
President’s political enemies.   And in each case the
<br>
ultimate
<br>
resolution was political rather than judicial.
<br>
<p>Why not consider amending the Constitution to provide
<br>
for assembling the
<br>
Electoral College in Washington when circumstances
<br>
suggest the need for
<br>
a vote of no confidence in the President?  This could
<br>
be done on
<br>
petition of a certain number of Congressmen, at the
<br>
request of the
<br>
President himself, or possibly by petition of some
<br>
number of Electors.
<br>
Failure of the vote of no confidence (which might
<br>
require a two-thirds
<br>
majority, so that it would not be undertaken lightly)
<br>
would result in
<br>
the removal of the President and the elevation of the
<br>
Vice-President.
<br>
<p>This would provide a mechanism for holding a president
<br>
accountable for
<br>
actions which, although not criminal per se, might be
<br>
grossly
<br>
inappropriate, ill-considered, or otherwise such that
<br>
the nation might
<br>
wish to see his removed from office.   Using the
<br>
College of Electors
<br>
would assure that the President’s own party would
<br>
always control the
<br>
majority, so that it could not be easily exploited for
<br>
partisan gain.
<br>
And it would end the dilemma of whether an unwise
<br>
action could be
<br>
construed as criminal for the purposes of impeachment.
<br>
&nbsp;Impeachment
<br>
would remain, but in practice it would be resorted to
<br>
only when the
<br>
lesser sanction had failed.
<br>
<p>One might argue that any Presidential candidate would
<br>
seek to insure
<br>
that Electors (now often minor political hacks) would
<br>
be chosen
<br>
exclusively for doglike personal loyalty to the
<br>
President.  But even
<br>
today the Electors themselves are chosen by the state
<br>
parties, not the
<br>
Presidential candidate.  And the parties would, I
<br>
suspect, see the
<br>
advantage of having that tool around in the event of a
<br>
disastrous
<br>
President who chooses to stonewall rather than heed
<br>
the party’s call to
<br>
leave for the general good.   The Electoral College
<br>
might become a final
<br>
honor for retired (voluntary or otherwise)
<br>
officeholders who are
<br>
generally respected and could be counted on for their
<br>
judgement.   The
<br>
way to get serious people on a body is to give it
<br>
serious powers, even
<br>
if rarely used.
<br>
<p>Gradually, I suspect that other uses might be found
<br>
from time to time
<br>
for a body of such composition.  Perhaps it might even
<br>
become a
<br>
deliberative and reflective body, somewhat like the
<br>
House of Lords after
<br>
it lost most of its power but before Tony Blair packed
<br>
it with his
<br>
cronies.  In any event, it is a unique
<br>
quasi-parliamentary body in the
<br>
American political structure.  Before considering its
<br>
abolition, it’s
<br>
worth thinking about what else it might be good for.
