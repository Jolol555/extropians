Hello everyone,
<br>
<p>Well, here are my resolutions for the coming year.  Goals which I plan to at least start on.  Really!!  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;1 Continue with my education.(tired of being poor and bored in my work) 
<br>
&nbsp;2 Become muscular and fit.(so I can armwrestle Max More one day! :) 
<br>
&nbsp;3 Obtain a driver's license.(it might take a miracle considering my dyslexia)
<br>
&nbsp;4 Master good grammar and composition.(I know some of you would really appreciate that -lol!)
<br>
&nbsp;5 Learn spanish.(mom already can speak it, so can girlfriend)
<br>
&nbsp;6 Master college algebra.(math scare me for some reason..)
<br>
&nbsp;7 Get life insurance-cryonics.(since I do write about it so much...)
<br>
&nbsp;8 Obtain employment(hey, I just did -yesterday!)
<br>
&nbsp;9 Learn self-defense.(could save my neck or someone elses)
<br>
10 Overcome my clinical depression.(could be the overall breakthrough I need) 
<br>
11 Win a major sweepstakes(yeah right!)
<br>
12 Attend church regularly(I really enjoy going)
<br>
13 Learn to swim(could come in handy one day)
<br>
14 Learn to dance(salsa, charleston, etc.)
<br>
15 Keep a journal daily(the doom of men is that the forget)
<br>
16 Purchase a computer (boy, do I want one)
<br>
17 Attend an Alcor and a Extropian Institute conference.(I can taste it!)  
<br>
18 Read at least one book weekly.(I could do this and not buy a new book till the 22nd century!)
<br>
<p>Well, there they are.  Now I just need to gather up my courage and inner fortitude to actually accomplish them.  Wish me luck!  Anyone else care to share their New Year's resolutions?  
<br>
<p>wishing a great new century and millennia to all here,
<br>
<p>John
