This just in:
<br>
Chatted with pops about his MOL memories. He was working on the camera
<br>
system (man operated, not remote) from '66 to '69 when the program was
<br>
cancelled. A co-worker of his, who is godfather to my sister, later told
<br>
him that he had been assigned to work on building seven of the cameras
<br>
from '70 to '72, which included a human controlled sighting mask like you
<br>
see on sub periscopes (which is after MOL was allegedly cancelled in '69).
<br>
I had thought that this might have been one of the four MOL 'experiments'
<br>
that were included on the Skylab vehicle in the mid 70's. That would have
<br>
been a plausible explaination for that continued work. After the 69
<br>
cancellation, my dad had gotten reassigned to go back to build CORONA
<br>
cameras (which he said was kinda like getting transferred from building
<br>
Lamborghinis to building model T's). This would have closed up all this
<br>
activity except for another of my Dad's childhood buddies who was an SP at
<br>
Vandenberg from 67-70, and said that they launched a MOL into a polar
<br>
orbit (based on the direction of the launch trajectory, and based on the
<br>
fact that that is mostly what Vandenberg is used for anyways). The
<br>
November '66 launch was from Canaveral into an orbit with only a 30 degree
<br>
angle of inclination, which was really only good for covering southern
<br>
parts of the USSR, so we do have an unaccounted for MOL launch (plus a few
<br>
others I heard about from other SPs who were stationed there in the late
<br>
70's). I have not been able to track down the second MOL mock-up that was
<br>
built by Douglas in 1967 (after the Gemini 12 and Gemini B launches in Nov
<br>
of the previous year), which you would think would be displayed in some
<br>
museum somewhere. Maybe it will turn up anyhow, maybe its sitting off in a
<br>
corner of the Vandenberg air park. If anyone on the list lives in the area
<br>
of Vandenberg, I'd appreciate it if you'd swing through there on a tour
<br>
and see if its sitting on a display stand somewhere. The second MOL mockup
<br>
may have gotten launched as well...
<br>
Ah, the info you can dig up in exchange for an afternoon of installing
<br>
bathroom lighting fixtures...
