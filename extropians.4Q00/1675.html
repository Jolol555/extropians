<em>&gt; The Social Discount Rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Andrew Caplin, John Leahy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NBER Working Paper No. W7983 Issued in October 2000
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In welfare theory it is standard to pick the consumption stream that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximizes the welfare of the representative agent. We argue against this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position, and show that a benevolent social planner will generally place a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater weight on future consumption than does the representative agent. Our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis has immediate implications for public policy: agents discount the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future too much and the government should promote future oriented policies.
</em><br>
<p>I paid the $5 to download this paper, and while I've just read the first
<br>
10 pages or so, I'm not sure I agree with their model of time preferences.
<br>
<p>Their basic point seems to be that people prefer present pleasure over
<br>
future pleasure, but then when they get to the future, they regret their
<br>
past choices.  I don't think this is as universal as they make it out
<br>
to be, although certainly there are some instances in which it happens.
<br>
<p>IMO people are mostly relatively satisfied with their past choices,
<br>
and don't usually regret past pleasures, wishing that they had been
<br>
postponed so that they could be enjoyed today.  Yet that seems to be
<br>
what the authors' time preference model implies.
<br>
<p>Suppose you have a rare treat, bananas, which you love and which aren't
<br>
usually available out of season.  You have ten bananas.  You could eat
<br>
them all today, or you could spread them out, one a day perhaps.
<br>
<p>The author's model would have you doing something like setting up a plan
<br>
to have 4 bananas today, 3 tomorrow, 2 the next day and 1 the last day.
<br>
The idea is that consumption today is worth more to you than consumption
<br>
tomorrow, and consumption the next day worth still less, and so on.
<br>
<p>Then, tomorrow, you regret having already eaten 4 bananas so that you
<br>
only have 6 left.  If only you'd been nicer to your future self, and
<br>
saved more bananas for today.  Nevertheless, today's bananas are still
<br>
worth more than tomorrows, so you go ahead and eat 3 of the 6 bananas
<br>
today, planning on eating 2 tomorrow and 1 the next day.
<br>
<p>Then, the next day, you mentally kick yourself for having pigged out on
<br>
all those bananas already, so that you only have 3 left.  Still, bananas
<br>
today are worth more than those tomorrow, so you eat 2 of your 3 today,
<br>
saving only 1 for tomorrow.
<br>
<p>Then, on the last day, you are miserably unhappy that you've eaten 9 of
<br>
your bananas so quickly, but you go ahead and eat the one remaining one
<br>
rather than save it, because consumption today is better than consumption
<br>
tomorrow.
<br>
<p>And finally, on the following days, you wallow in sorrow for having
<br>
eaten all the bananas so soon.
<br>
<p>While this little story does have enough of a germ of truth that we can
<br>
recognize some elements in our own lives, I think it is not a universal
<br>
experience for all of our consumption.  It has a childish quality, the
<br>
stupidity and naivity of our character as he continually berates himself
<br>
for behaviors in the past which he continues to follow in the present.
<br>
His inability to learn from his mistakes, while a weakness that we can all
<br>
identify with to some extent, is something that most of us can overcome.
