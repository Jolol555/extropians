<em>&gt; Dan: Thanks for your responses to Elaine's rather snide comments on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Principles. You clearly explained the reasons for some of the changes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike: None of the changes have anything to do with being PC. Both Curt and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dan explained the change from &quot;Dynamic Optimism&quot; to &quot;Practical Optimism&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The stress is on actually *doing* rather than hoping and wishing.
</em><br>
<p>I understand the intent, which I share. However, whenever I hear someone saying
<br>
'lets get practical', its typically some control freak cynic who wants to paint
<br>
a visionary pioneer as a wild eyed nut job, or at best as an unworldly
<br>
intellectual who needs help tying their shoes.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for &quot;Perpetual Progress&quot; -- I think you're off-base to say this is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *opposite* of &quot;Boundless Expansion&quot;. If you're determined to interpret it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that way, in contradiction to the actual text, then I can't stop you. BE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounded to many people like growth for growth's sake--a &quot;pave over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe&quot; image. PP more clearly focuses on *improvement*. If you have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better name for the principle, fire away, but I'm not choosing or rejecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles to be PC. I consider such a suggestion quite annoying. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradicts my entire life.
</em><br>
<p>But I WANT to pilot a Vogon Constructor Ship... ;)
<br>
<p>If it were Boundless Development, I could understand the reference to 'paving
<br>
over the universe'. With ExI based in California, I can understand how some
<br>
would jump quickly on an association with 'Los Angelization', or 'sprawl'. I
<br>
personally do not see Boundless Expansion making any sort of a qualitative claim
<br>
on how humanity is to expand into the universe.
<br>
<p>Then again, who is to say that development *isn't* good? If you goal is merely
<br>
to attract a more politically broad spectrum of transhumanists to extropy, I
<br>
suppose worry about perceptions of non-Green sentiments would concern you. Heck,
<br>
Robert Bradubury doesn't just want to pave over the universe, he wants to take
<br>
it apart atom by atom and reconstruct it. The many discussions about megascale
<br>
engineering projects do make us universe pavers. The discussion then should be
<br>
about what to pave and what to pave, not 'should we pave at all?'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm always glad to see productive discussion of the Principles, since I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never satisfied with them. I too miss the easiness of the five principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of version 2.5 and the smart acronym, but overall think 3.0 is better.
</em><br>
<p>There are some things I am happy to see in 3.0. I would like the presence of
<br>
Open Society and Self Direction to delineate some boundary of individual
<br>
privacy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, version 4.0 will somehow simultaneously encapsulate the ideas more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; briefly while laying them out more extensively and clearly. Maybe the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to do this is a multi-level approach, with a short form, then an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extended form with derivative principles. One challenge is that I see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Principles as arising from a network of interconnected ideas, not as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hierarchy derived from some ultimate value. I see the principles as more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like attractors than axioms.
</em><br>
<p>Though those would be nice too...
