<em>&gt; As someone who spent a number of years as an energy analyst, developing
</em><br>
energy
<br>
<em>&gt; conservation technologies, you don't know what you are talking about.
</em><br>
Every
<br>
<em>&gt; trend in resource cost is downward, and availability is upward. Stopy
</em><br>
buying the
<br>
<em>&gt; Green lies.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but is it right that we use the amounts of energy and resources that we
<br>
do when billions of people live in poverty and strife?  Tell me, is it
<br>
right?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; By apocalypse, I was not referring to disaster, but to rapture.  Where
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all this wealth going to come from, with our resources destroyed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wasteful behavior of the 20th century?  Where is this longevity going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; come from, with our veins filled with carcinogens and our bodies
</em><br>
bombarded
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by radiation?  Where is this happiness going to come from, with our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spirituality destroyed by &quot;flatlander&quot; philosophers, our arts smashed by
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; media concerned only with profits, living in a world where we work from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sunup until sundown with no hope for another world hereafter?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, you really are a mess, aren't you? Resources do not get 'destroyed'.
</em><br>
They
<br>
<em>&gt; just get reallocated. Every technological advancement allows the amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources needed to produce every dollar of economic activity to decrease
</em><br>
all
<br>
<em>&gt; the time. Where do you think all the wealth of our economy comes from? It
</em><br>
didn't
<br>
<em>&gt; just come from us trading iron and corn back and forth and paying a wage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Technology increases productivity, which decreases the amount of resources
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; need to live an ever higher standard of living. Get off the Malthusian BS,
</em><br>
he
<br>
<em>&gt; was disproven long ago.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, resources get reallocated into useless forms- landfills, atmospheric
<br>
pollutants, goods that we don't need, decaying cities, etc.  If we can't
<br>
break out of this gravity well (in all honesty, I really doubt that we
<br>
will), we're done for.
<br>
<p>You seem to want to talk down to me.  Frankly, I don't appreciate it.  I'm
<br>
not an optimist, I love the Earth that I'm living on, and I'm tired of being
<br>
given no options other than positivism (which, if John Horgan's book is
<br>
correct, is running out of steam quickly).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Rationalism is a dogma in of itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, its a process.
</em><br>
<p>Every read &quot;The Ayn Rand Cult&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, its an ascending paradigm based on factual data. I quite understand
</em><br>
how you
<br>
<em>&gt; are so confused. Gnostics were living by the same sort of omen-ism as
</em><br>
Harvey
<br>
<em>&gt; described was typical of ancient Hebrews, and other beleivers in gematria.
</em><br>
If
<br>
<em>&gt; every group of sheep in a field stands for a number or prophesy as a
</em><br>
concrete
<br>
<em>&gt; fact, it is easy to see how the gnostics would regard their 'knowledge' as
</em><br>
being
<br>
<em>&gt; fact based rather than just theology.
</em><br>
<p>Ascending paradigms are those which revolve around spirit and deny matter-
<br>
descending paradigms are those which revolve around matter and reject
<br>
spirit.  I'm borrowing this from Ken Wilber.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This is quite so, but not dogmatically. If you know anything about the
</em><br>
Gnostics,
<br>
<em>&gt; the main reason they were declared a heresy by Rome was their refusal to
</em><br>
bow
<br>
<em>&gt; down to dogma. Refusal to accept dogma is not itself a dogma, something
</em><br>
about
<br>
<em>&gt; which you seem to be confused.
</em><br>
<p>Sure it's a dogma. Even reason itself requires faith.
<br>
