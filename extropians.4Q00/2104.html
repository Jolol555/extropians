<p>I tend to think that it's really the long term funding game involved in
<br>
ISS that is the &quot;stunt&quot;, no doubt tending to drive up the total cost
<br>
that people quote when they figure in all the redesigns that have been
<br>
done over the years. However, the zero-g research will no doubt be real
<br>
enough, right, it'll be real science even when there is some overlap
<br>
with what's been done before?
<br>
<p>As for the desirability of the zero-g environment for humans, I think
<br>
there is potentially a great &quot;comparative advantage&quot; to this for
<br>
commercial and/or medical purposes -- these might center on the need or
<br>
desire for humans to try out modified gravity environments, whether we
<br>
are talking pure microgravity, as on ISS, or some variation on 'spin
<br>
gravity effect&quot; on stations designed for that in the future. Zero-g
<br>
and/or low-gravity-spin-g are things that you just can't do very much of
<br>
outside of going into orbit! On basic economic grounds this just has to
<br>
have some commercial potential, provided you can get there cheaply
<br>
enough (whether people want to go to play, or do the &quot;TV show space
<br>
survivor&quot; thing in a novel way, or maybe find medical benefits that work
<br>
for certain people, or do space sports, or who knows what else)?
<br>
<p>Compared to the radical factor of allowing human access to zero-g,
<br>
having access to moon rocks would be sort of a piddling thing in itself,
<br>
it seems to me. Sure, when you're really ready to build many things in
<br>
space, you'll want an off-Earth source of materials, to save the lift
<br>
costs of launching those construction materials. Meanwhile though, maybe
<br>
effective commercial ventures could be based on the truly novel zero-g
<br>
property that we find as soon as we get into orbital free fall?
