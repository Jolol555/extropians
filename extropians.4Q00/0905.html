This worry about the Singularity implies that the technology exists or will 
<br>
soon exist to prolong and vastly expand the length and quality of human 
<br>
life/existence. My contention is why should the maddening crowds sweat the 
<br>
details when the technology is even in the pipeline yet? Cryogenics is not a 
<br>
sure thing for mammals, as we have no real means of ensuring revival. I am 
<br>
not, against cryogenics and cheerfully, support it. Yet, that seems to be the 
<br>
best we can do for now and maybe it'll work by the time revival technology is 
<br>
available. Come up with the demonstrated technology to show that a 
<br>
Singularity is soon possible (Uploading/Neural Replacement?) and Joe Six Pack 
<br>
will embrace it.

<p>&lt;&lt; Having been pressured by someone else on this list to pressure my
<br>
&nbsp;relatives into buying the ultimate life insurance of cryo (I intend to
<br>
&nbsp;get it for myself, but they do not and will not, so the only result of
<br>
&nbsp;pressuring them would be to damage my relationships with them), I asked
<br>
&nbsp;myself why so many of our friends and loved ones will not spare us the
<br>
&nbsp;pain of knowing that some day, well within our own extended lifetimes,
<br>
&nbsp;they will be gone forever.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;The answer, I think, or at least part of it, is that a commitment to
<br>
&nbsp;immortality - or a commitment to eventual permanent death - commonly
<br>
&nbsp;defines part of who and what a person is.  I think I can safely assume
<br>
&nbsp;that everyone on this list can easily see themselves being a hundred, a
<br>
&nbsp;thousand, even a billion (or insert whatever big number) years old and
<br>
&nbsp;still enjoying life, in whatever form has been obtained at that time.
<br>
&nbsp;But such is not the case for everyone.  Many people see themselves at
<br>
&nbsp;seventy/eighty/whatever and having done everything they want to do,
<br>
&nbsp;growing bored and tired of life.  We embrace the infinite, they embrace
<br>
&nbsp;the finite, and both sides define their dreams and aspirations around
<br>
&nbsp;it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Unlike the infamous frog in slowly boiling water, there is no gradation
<br>
&nbsp;from finite to infinite; even the cocept causes immense future shock.
<br>
&nbsp;Some individuals can adjust themselves from one to the other, and the
<br>
&nbsp;chances of doing so are greater with greater realization that the
<br>
&nbsp;necessary technology - including social technology of mindsets and so
<br>
&nbsp;forth, to keep coming up with new things to do - is available, but to
<br>
&nbsp;force the issue is to ask someone to reject that person's own sense of
<br>
&nbsp;self...so no wonder it is so vigorously and emotionally resisted.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;This is ironic if true.  With all the power that shall be available to
<br>
&nbsp;us, the one thing we might desire most - to bring the rest of humanity
<br>
&nbsp;along with us - might be one of the few things that remains impossible
<br>
&nbsp;even for us.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Which leads to a disturbing thought.  What if the Singularity arrives,
<br>
&nbsp;but the only people who can take advantage of it are those who want to
<br>
&nbsp;take advantage of it...and, given the extreme rate of change this
<br>
&nbsp;entails, only a small fraction of the human race is comfortable making
<br>
&nbsp;this change?  The best and brightest, who might otherwise lead the norms
<br>
&nbsp;into a new era, will - out of pure self-interest if nothing else - join
<br>
&nbsp;us, leaving the masses ignorant, confused, and mostly stagnant.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Previous radical advances, for instance the Industrial Revolution, were
<br>
&nbsp;one-off advances, or at least a finite series of major changes, and thus
<br>
&nbsp;could be gradually adopted.  The Singularity promises an eternal state
<br>
&nbsp;of flux; one either embraces eternal upgrades and intellectual
<br>
&nbsp;expansion, or stays at whatever level one happens to be at and watches
<br>
&nbsp;those who made the other choice go beyond comprehension.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;I doubt that everyone would leave the relative luddites to their own
<br>
&nbsp;devices.  Some would seek to exploit them like beasts, while others
<br>
&nbsp;would seek to help those who refuse help; neither option seems to
<br>
&nbsp;promise effective aid.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Or is this even a matter of concern?  For our sakes and theirs, should
<br>
&nbsp;most of us look back on them as no more interesting than the fragments
<br>
&nbsp;of the eggshell from which we emerged?  Intellectually, this would seem
<br>
&nbsp;to be the safest approach, but instinct and a reading of history say
<br>
&nbsp;that, whenever there emerges a power discrepancy of that magnitude
<br>
&nbsp;between the elite and the common, the common act to balance that
<br>
&nbsp;discrepancy, with negative consequences for the elite.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;All of this, though, does lead to an observation of use right now: when
<br>
&nbsp;trying to get support for your ideas, don't ask people to change just to
<br>
&nbsp;suit your own desires.  The personal decisions of others are personal,
<br>
&nbsp;and based on their own values - even if they are insane when judged by
<br>
&nbsp;your values.  Know what is flexible about someone, or at least what is
<br>
&nbsp;usually flexible about most people, before trying to bend it - and a
<br>
&nbsp;desire for or against immortality (including cryo) is rarely flexible. &gt;&gt;
