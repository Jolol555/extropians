<em>&gt; No wonder the luddites are winning.  Robert

<p>And the greens.  Consider the current strategy of the greens: to
<br>
minimize or reverse anything that humans have done to modify
<br>
the environment.  An example would be the fiasco over the wild
<br>
burros and mules in Death Valley.  Since they were originally
<br>
brought in by the miners, so they are not native and should be,
<br>
by green theory, removed.  However the greens do not wish to
<br>
actually slaughter the burros, which are after all *wild* animals,
<br>
so they rounded them up and offered them to people to keep
<br>
as pets.  Wellllll, turns out wild burros didnt make such good pets,
<br>
for reasons you can easily imagine.  Soon enterprising people were
<br>
&quot;adopting&quot; the beasts and immediately selling them to the
<br>
dogfood company.
<br>
<p>The question then becomes, how long must a species exist in an
<br>
area to be considered native, assuming it was originally transplanted
<br>
there by humans?  Can that species *ever* achieve native-hood?
<br>
<p>Nowthen, there is no talk of exterminating beavers, these creatures
<br>
that modify their environment to the detriment of at least *some*
<br>
other species.  Beavers are natural.  Consequently, if the greens wish
<br>
to prevent or reverse modification of the environment by humans,
<br>
the implication is that *humans are not animals.*  Or that humans
<br>
are somehow not *natural.*  If that is the case, can humans *ever*
<br>
achieve the status of &quot;natural&quot;?  Do we need to lose our technology,
<br>
take off our clothes and eat bugs in order to be natural?  How do
<br>
we *become* animals?  Looks to me like this notion contradicts
<br>
evolution, so do the greens then oppose the teaching of evolution?
<br>
<p>Might we see then the fundies and the greens join forces against
<br>
those who would teach science?  That would be strange indeed
<br>
to see *those two guys* working together.  spike
