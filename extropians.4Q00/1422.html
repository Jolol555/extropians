FIRST MEASUREMENTS OF ACCELERATIONS OF STARS ORBITING
<br>
OUR GALACTIC NUCLEUS
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of supermassive stars must result in collapse,
<br>
since no known force can resist gravity in such stars once their
<br>
nuclear energy sources are exhausted. For the most massive stars,
<br>
the result of this inevitable collapse is the &quot;*black hole&quot;, at
<br>
the present time the most exotic astronomical object in the
<br>
Universe. In recent years, astrophysicists have come to
<br>
distinguish ordinary black holes and supermassive black holes,
<br>
and these latter objects now reign as the supreme cosmic exotica,
<br>
with masses 1 million to nearly 10 billion times the mass of the
<br>
Sun, and an origin completely unknown. The center of our own
<br>
Galaxy is apparently a supermassive black hole, and observations
<br>
indicate that supermassive black hole growth and galaxy formation
<br>
in general are closely linked. Supermassive black holes are thus
<br>
becoming an integral part of our understanding of galaxy
<br>
formation and galaxy dynamics. One important approach is to
<br>
estimate the properties of a galactic-center black hole from
<br>
measurements of the gravitational behavior of nearby objects.
<br>
... ... A.M. Ghez et al (5 authors at University of California
<br>
Los Angeles, US) now report the first measurements of
<br>
accelerations of stars orbiting the supermassive black hole that
<br>
apparently forms the center of our Galaxy. The authors make the
<br>
following points:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Recent measurements of the velocities of stars near the
<br>
center of the Milky Way Galaxy have provided the strongest
<br>
evidence for the presence of a supermassive black hole, but the
<br>
observational uncertainties make the properties of the black hole
<br>
ill-defined. More precise information concerning the position and
<br>
mass of the central black hole can be obtained by determining the
<br>
accelerations of stars in their orbits around the center.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The authors report measurements of the accelerations of
<br>
three stars located approximately 0.005 *parsecs (projected on
<br>
the sky) from the central radio source Sagittarius A*. The
<br>
authors report these accelerations are comparable to those
<br>
experienced by the Earth as it orbits the Sun. The authors
<br>
suggest their data increase the inferred minimum mass density in
<br>
the central region of the Galaxy by an order of magnitude
<br>
relative to previous results, and localize the dark mass to
<br>
within 0.05 +- 0.04 arcsec of the nominal position of Sagittarius
<br>
A*. In addition, the authors suggest the orbital period of one of
<br>
the observed stars could be as short as 15 years, which would
<br>
provide an opportunity in the near future to observe an entire
<br>
period.
<br>
... ... In a commentary on the above work, John Kormendy
<br>
(University of Texas Austin, US) states: &quot;With these
<br>
measurements, the authors help to identify Sagittarius A* as the
<br>
supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. They also
<br>
test -- and provide support for -- fundamental assumptions about
<br>
the dynamics of the Galactic center and our understanding of
<br>
violent activity in [*active] galactic nuclei.&quot;

<br>
ON THE BLACK HOLE AT THE CENTER OF OUR GALAXY
<br>
Recent observations have led to the conclusion that at the center
<br>
of many galaxies there is an object producing effects
<br>
characteristic of a supermassive *black hole. Alexei V.
<br>
Filippenko (University of California Berkeley, US) reviews
<br>
current research on black holes, the author making the following
<br>
points concerning the apparent massive black hole at the center
<br>
of our own Galaxy:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Some galaxies are known to have very &quot;active&quot; central
<br>
regions from which enormous amounts of energy are emitted each
<br>
second. These &quot;active galactic nuclei&quot; are probably powered by
<br>
accretion of matter into a supermassive black hole of 10^(6) to
<br>
10^(9) solar-masses. The center of our own Galaxy exhibits mild
<br>
activity, especially at radio wavelengths: so-called &quot;nonthermal
<br>
radiation&quot; characteristic of high-energy electrons spiraling in
<br>
magnetic fields is emitted by a compact object at the Galactic
<br>
center known as *Sagittarius A*. Does the center harbor a
<br>
supermassive black hole? One approach is to determine whether
<br>
stars in the central region are moving very rapidly, as would be
<br>
expected if a large mass were present. During the past 5 years,
<br>
two teams have obtained high-resolution images of our Galactic
<br>
center, each team on several occasions, so that temporal changes
<br>
in the positions of stars could be detected. The observations
<br>
were conducted at infrared wavelengths, which penetrate the gas
<br>
and dust between Earth and the Galactic center (a distance of
<br>
approximately 25,000 light years) much more readily than optical
<br>
light. In summary, the data are in excellent agreement with the
<br>
conclusion that the gravitational potential of the central region
<br>
of our Galaxy is dominated by a single object. The derived mass
<br>
of this object is (2.6 +- 0.2) x 10^(6) solar-masses, and the
<br>
mass density within a radius of 0.05 light-years is at least 6 x
<br>
10^(9) solar-masses per cubic light-year, effectively eliminating
<br>
all possibilities other than a black hole.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Although our Galaxy provides the most convincing case for
<br>
the existence of supermassive black holes, observations of the
<br>
centers of a few other galaxies bolster the conclusion. For
<br>
example, very precise measurements of the galaxy NGC 4258 reveal
<br>
a central compact object with a derived mass 3.6 x 10^(7) solar-
<br>
masses. On somewhat larger scales, spectra obtained with the
<br>
Hubble Space Telescope show gas and stars rapidly moving in a
<br>
manner consistent with the presence of a supermassive black hole.
<br>
The most massive existing case, that of the giant elliptical
<br>
galaxy M87, is approximately 3 x 10^(9) solar-masses. Moreover,
<br>
x-ray observations of some active galactic nuclei reveal emission
<br>
from a hot disk of gas apparently very close to a black hole,
<br>
since extreme relativistic effects are detected. In general, it
<br>
now seems that a supermassive black hole is found in nearly every
<br>
large galaxy amenable to such observations.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The author concludes: &quot;In the last decade of the 20th
<br>
century, black holes have moved firmly from the arena of science
<br>
fiction to that of science fact. Their existence in some *binary
<br>
star systems, and at the centers of massive galaxies, is nearly
<br>
irrefutable. They provide marvelous laboratories in which the
<br>
strong-field predictions of Einstein's general theory of
<br>
relativity can be tested.&quot;

source in the constellation Sagittarius, coincident with or close

<br>
diameter. Sagittarius A* is a compact component at the heart of
<br>
the central core of Sagittarius A. Sagittarius A* is an intense
<br>
source of radio waves, and is apparently unique in our Galaxy:
<br>
while everything else in our Galaxy is on the move as they follow
<br>
their orbits, Sagittarius A* is absolutely stationary and must

therefore lie exactly at the Galaxy's center. Many astronomers,

in fact, use Sagittarius A* as the &quot;Greenwich Meridian&quot; of the

Galaxy.
<br>
... ... *binary star systems: Binary stars are a pair of stars
<br>
revolving around a common center of mass under the influence of
<br>
their mutual gravitational attraction, and apparently the

majority of stars in the Universe are binaries and not singlets.
<br>
In some cases the binary system is resolvable into two
<br>
components, and in other cases the presence of a second star is
<br>
inferred by perturbations in the motion or emitted radiation of
<br>
the first star. If the binaries are close enough, they may share
<br>
stellar material, and this results in a particular kind of
<br>
stellar evolution. In the black hole-binary systems mentioned in
<br>
this report, matter transfers from a relatively normal star
<br>
(known as the &quot;secondary star&quot;) to a dark compact object (the
<br>
&quot;primary&quot;). Recent comparisons of x-ray and optical brightness
<br>
suggest that in many cases the dark primary in such a binary
<br>
system is a black hole.

<p>5. PLANETARY SCIENCE:
<br>
IMAGING AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF ASTEROID EROS
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR), a Discovery
<br>
spacecraft launched on 17 February 1996, was designed to carry
<br>
out the first detailed orbital investigation of an asteroid.
<br>
After a flyby of asteroid 253 Mathilde in June 1997, and a
<br>
swingby of Earth in January 1998, the spacecraft carried out an
<br>
unintended flyby of the asteroid Eros, approaching within 3800
<br>
kilometers on 23 December 1998. During this flyby, data important
<br>
to the detailed planning of the subsequent orbital mission, such
<br>
as mass, dimensions, and spin state, were obtained. On 3 January
<br>
1999, a burn was executed to slow the speed of the spacecraft
<br>
relative to Eros from approximately 1 kilometer per second to
<br>
only 10 meters per second, resulting in a year-long gradual
<br>
return to the asteroid. The spacecraft was successfully inserted
<br>
into an initial orbit around Eros on 14 February 2000.
<br>
... ... J. Veverka et al (33 authors at 10 installations, US)
<br>
present an analysis of data obtained from the NEAR mission to
<br>
Eros, the authors making the following points:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Discovered in 1898, Eros was the first asteroid found to
<br>
cross the orbit of Mars, and was the first asteroid detected to
<br>
show periodic brightness fluctuations, which were soon attributed
<br>
correctly to its elongated shape and a rapid rotation period of
<br>
5.27 hours. The orbital path of Eros takes it from 1.13
<br>
*astronomical units (AU), close to Earth's orbit, to beyond the
<br>
orbit of Mars at 1.73 AU, every 1.76 years. Spectrally, Eros is
<br>
classified as an S-type asteroid, the type common in the inner
<br>
portions of the asteroid belt, the surface mineralogy of which is
<br>
apparently dominated by silicates (pyroxene and olivine) and Fe-
<br>
metal.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Eros is a very elongated (34 kilometers by 11 kilometers
<br>
by 11 kilometers) asteroid, most of the surface of which is
<br>
saturated with craters smaller than 1 kilometer in diameter. The
<br>
largest crater is 5.5 kilometers across, but there is a 10-
<br>
kilometer saddle-like depression with attributes of a large
<br>
degraded crater. Surface lineations, both grooves and ridges, are
<br>
prominent on Eros; some of these probably involve planes of
<br>
weakness produced by collisions on Eros and/or its parent body.
<br>
Ejecta blocks (30 to 100 meters across) are abundant but not
<br>
uniformly distributed over the surface. *Albedo variations are
<br>
restricted to the inner walls of certain craters and may be
<br>
related to downslope movement of *regolith. On scales of 200
<br>
meters to 1 kilometer, Eros is relatively bland in terms of color
<br>
variations, and spectra are consistent with an *ordinary
<br>
chondrite composition for which the measured density of 2.67 +-
<br>
0.1 grams per cubic centimeter implies internal porosities
<br>
ranging from approximately 10 to 30 percent.
<br>
... ... In a commentary on the above report, Richard P. Binzel
<br>
(Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US) states: &quot;No longer
<br>
just &quot;star-like&quot; points in the sky, asteroids have become the
<br>
focus of dedicated geological and geophysical studies aimed at
<br>
gaining insights into planetary formation and addressing
<br>
practical concerns for the long-term safety of our planet. These
<br>
studies are yielding new links to meteorites and planetary
<br>
origins.&quot;

PLANETARY SCIENCE: POROUS ASTEROIDS AND PLANET FORMATION
<br>
Asteroids (also called &quot;minor planets&quot;) are small rocky objects,
<br>
most of which orbit the Sun in a belt between the orbits of Mars
<br>
and Jupiter. A few asteroids follow orbits that bring them into
<br>
the inner Solar System, and several asteroids occasionally pass
<br>
within a few tens of millions of miles of Earth. Some asteroids
<br>
are located in the orbit of Jupiter, and some asteroids have been
<br>
detected as far away as the orbit of Saturn. Concerning asteroids
<br>
in general, approximately 200 of these objects are more than 100
<br>
kilometers (60 miles) in diameter, and more than 2000 asteroids
<br>
are more than 10 kilometers in diameter. There are believed to be
<br>
approximately half a million asteroids with diameters greater
<br>
than 1 kilometer. The consensus view is that asteroids are
<br>
composed of material that failed to build a planet at a distance
<br>
of 2.8 *astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, perhaps due to the
<br>
influence of massive Jupiter just outside the asteroid belt
<br>
[*Note #1]. Until recently, the shapes and surface features of
<br>
asteroids were a matter of conjecture; during the past decade,
<br>
however, significant direct observations of asteroids have been
<br>
relayed back to Earth from spacecraft.
<br>
... ... Erik Asphaug (University of California Santa Cruz, US)
<br>
presents a review of current research on the geology of
<br>
asteroids, the author making the following points:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The dominant geological process affecting asteroids is
<br>
collision with other asteroids, most of these collisions
<br>
producing craters formed when material is blown explosively from
<br>
the impact site. The most violent collisions are catastrophic and
<br>
produce families of smaller asteroids. At lower impact
<br>
velocities, colliding asteroids can merge, and this is relevant
<br>
for an understanding of the formation of planets from the swarm
<br>
of *planetesimals (proto-asteroids) in the early Solar System.
<br>
Because catastrophic collisions and cratering reduce the mass of
<br>
an asteroid, one research problem has been to provide an
<br>
explanation of the survival of asteroids and a description of how
<br>
planetesimals could have accumulated into planets.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) All known apparent asteroid densities are quite low,
<br>
suggesting these bodies are porous. This porosity might be due to
<br>
a fragmented internal structure or to a structure consisting of
<br>
loosely bound piles of material. Many asteroids have giant
<br>
craters which are half their total size or larger, and since
<br>
craters of that size cannot form in solid rock without shattering
<br>
the parent body to pieces, their existence has been a puzzle.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Computer models and laboratory experiments have
<br>
demonstrated that because a composite asteroid transmits impact
<br>
energy so poorly, it is much more difficult to break up than a
<br>
monolithic asteroid, so the internal composition and structure of
<br>
an asteroid are important factors determining the effect of a
<br>
collision.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) A recent hypothesis by Housen et al (2 installations,
<br>
US), based on experimental data and dimensional analysis
<br>
(scaling) arguments, suggests that highly porous asteroids might
<br>
accumulate rather than lose mass during collisions. These authors
<br>
show that giant craters could be formed by compression of a
<br>
highly porous target, rather than as a result of ejected
<br>
material. Thus, high porosity might be a transient feature of
<br>
certain asteroids, which become more dense with each impact. This
<br>
is good news for researchers who model planet formation and who
<br>
need a mechanism for planetesimal mass accumulation. But it is
<br>
bad news for planners of protection of the Earth against asteroid
<br>
impacts, because the implication is that instead of an asteroid

Text Notes:
<br>
... ... *astronomical units (AU): 1 AU = the mean distance from
<br>
the Sun to the Earth = approximately 93 million miles, and
<br>
exactly 149,597,870 kilometers.
<br>
... ... *Note #1: The figure &quot;2.8&quot; is based on Bode's law
<br>
(Titius-Bode law), an intriguing relationship between the
<br>
distances of the planets from the Sun, named after Johann Titius
<br>
(1729-1796) (who formulated the law in 1766) and Johann Bode
<br>
(1747-1826) (who published the law in 1772). Take the sequence
<br>
0,3,6,12,24,..., where each number (except the 3) is twice the
<br>
previous number, add 4 to each number and divide by 10. The
<br>
resulting sequence (0.4, 0.7, 1.0, 1.6, 2.8, 5.2,...) is in good
<br>
agreement with the actual distances in astronomical units of most
<br>
planets, provided that the asteroids are included and considered
<br>
as one entity at a mean distance of 2.8 AU. Although the law
<br>
fails to predict the correct distances for Neptune and Pluto,
<br>
some researchers believe the law may have some significance with
<br>
respect to the formation of the Solar System. The law did predict
<br>
the distances of the 6 planets known by Titius and Bode, and led
<br>
Bode to predict the existence of an undiscovered planet between
<br>
Mars and Jupiter.
<br>
... ... *planetesimals (proto-asteroids): Planetesimals are
<br>
bodies with dimensions of 10^(-3) to 10^(3) meters that are
<br>
believed to form planets (or asteroids) by a process of
<br>
accretion. The term &quot;accretion&quot; refers to an aggregation, an
<br>
increase in the mass of a body by the addition of smaller bodies
<br>
that collide and adhere to it, provided the relative velocities
<br>
are low enough for coalescence. As the mass of the agglomerate
<br>
increases, so does the rate of accretion, and this accretion
<br>
process is believed to generally occur in a disk of debris
<br>
surrounding a star (stellar accretion disk), the disk a swarm of
<br>
dust grains that evolve into planetesimals and then planets.

<p>The first issue of SCIENCE-WEEK appeared May 1, 1997, and it has
<br>
been published regularly each week since that date. SW is
<br>
designed to cross existing conceptual and linguistic barriers
<br>
between the scientific disciplines. In general, the biology is
<br>
written for physicists and chemists, and the physics and
<br>
chemistry are written for biologists, with an attempt to retain
<br>
some exactitude in the particular science involved in the news.
<br>
These are the aims. Undoubtedly, we are not always successful,
<br>
and for that we apologize. In any case, what we hope is that our
<br>
readers are reading out of their fields more than in their
<br>
fields, since that is the essence of this publication.
<br>
<p>We welcome comments, suggestions, and criticisms from our
<br>
subscribers. Public letters relevant to any report are also
<br>
welcome. Editorial contact: <a href="mailto:editors@scienceweek.com?Subject=Re:%20two%20bits%20from%20SCIENCE-WEEK%20October%2020,%202000&In-Reply-To=&lt;14834.18666.228272.448814@lrz.uni-muenchen.de&gt;">editors@scienceweek.com</a>
