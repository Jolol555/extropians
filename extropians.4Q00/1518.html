<em>&gt; Unfortunately, the Mir thing is very unlikely to happen, Mir will be de-orbited. It was a great idea but MirCorp made the mistake of trusting the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/fc/Science/Mir_Space_Station/">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/fc/Science/Mir_Space_Station/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For various related stories.

<p>I'm not worried too much. According to MirCorp, the official in question
<br>
actually said that IF sufficient commercial funds cannot be raised, it will be
<br>
deorbited (one more example of 'don't trust the media'. MirCorp says they have
<br>
$110 million in funds and financing to keep Mir operating for another year, and
<br>
the dirty word is that Russian officials saying things like 'it will be
<br>
de-orbited' means that they are trying to pressure someone for a bribe...
<br>
<p>NASA has been pressuring Russia to drop the Mir, no matter whether they get it
<br>
independently funded or not. This could be the same sort of territoriality that
<br>
NASA always does to try to shut out the competition (like it did in trying to
<br>
destroy the Saturn V plans when they were building the Space Shuttle). NASA has
<br>
had enough trouble selling the ISS to the public and the science community, if
<br>
there is a competetive station out there, they wont be able to charge a premium
<br>
for access...
