<p>Maybe 1 sci-fi show a week unless I'm too sick to feel like touching the
<br>
computer.  Then a few hours laid out surfing the satellite will seem
<br>
almost bearable.

<em>&gt; &gt; 2.  Information-based Careers:  People develop careers that are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information-based and less labor-based.  That is a major difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is due to some economic factors, there will always be demand to support many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor-based or &quot;blue collar&quot; jobs.  For example, the minimum wage is higher in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Silicon Valley than South Dakota.  Besides that, whoever cares to be a tradesman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or craftsman has only less competition.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  Many  blue-collar jobs that I've seen are either being automated,
<br>
made much more technical or moved off-shore.
<br>
<p>As the world becomes more information dense and information dependent it
<br>
is obvious that more people will have information-based or related
<br>
jobs.    
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3.  Education:  Almost everybody has basic education today.  That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different than in previous centuries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes that's true.  They have an education more based upon written learning and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract expression than those of previous generations, which might have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about farming or life at that time.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the compulsory state-provided education is resulting in
<br>
arguably more functional illiteracy and in precious few well educated
<br>
much less intellectually productive citizens.  I have seen figures
<br>
claiming that something like 50% of college graduates never read a
<br>
complete book in the rest of their lives.  Going into the high tech
<br>
future, this is a major disaster.  
<br>
<p>I have some really bright friends who spend most of their time playing
<br>
EverQuest except for the minimum to keep body and soul together and put
<br>
in a minimum of time at work.  I don't understand such things.  Of
<br>
course it is their right but it is as if they don't see what is coming
<br>
down the pike at all or don't want to be a part of determining what that
<br>
is despite having more talent than most any dozen really bright people
<br>
each.  And these aren't wastoids.  The vast majority of people in the US
<br>
know almost no science by the polls, less math, and believe an
<br>
incredible array of utterly preposterous things that they claim shape
<br>
their most fundamental values.  Pretty damn scary. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 6.  Communications:  Not much can happen in the world without us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; knowing about it instantly.  No major wars can break out, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assassinations can occur, no major disasters can occur without us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seeing it first-hand within minutes or hours of the event.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  Does the news matter more than it does then?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It actually matters less.  There is more news in bulk but far less real
<br>
analysis of it and what there is is seldom in terms of fundamental
<br>
principles.  News is pretty strongly biased.  At least I have lived long
<br>
enough to see more sides of several stories than ever made the news. 
<br>
I've lived more than long enough to watch commentators basing their
<br>
&quot;analysis&quot; on what some other commentator believed or claimed without
<br>
bothering to engage their own brain at all except to filter words
<br>
through.  There are tons more channels for the depressingly same memes
<br>
to propagate.   
<br>
<p>And of course we still miss a lot from places where the news sources are
<br>
rigourously controlled by the state.  We see what can be seen from orbit
<br>
but the rest we are largely blind to.
