<p>'Twas based on the best science they had at the time.

<em>&gt; People said many things, but I wonder why you keep mentioning that

<em>&gt; &quot;people said&quot; thing. It bears no relevance to argumentation. People
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also said witches don't float on water and the brain is an organ for

</em><br>
<em>&gt; straw and dirty cloth, and that stones can't fall from the skies.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; People once said that nothing could move faster than light under any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; circumstances.  (There's still debate over whether anything useful is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; being moved in the latest experiments.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no debate. You can't signal faster than the speed of light in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vacuum. If you've read more than that into it you fell into the trap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of wishful thinking.
</em><br>
<p>What about, say, two entangled photons separated by a significant
<br>
distance?  Affect one, and the other appears to be instantly - not
<br>
allowing-for-information-to-travel-at-speed-of-light later, but
<br>
instantly - affected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Part of technology is finding ways around limits.  There's a provable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; maximum efficiency for chemical rockets?  Fine, switch to another
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; propulsion (say, fuel or light) with provably higher limits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Eventually, switch to moving without propulsion - synchronized quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; teleportation over large distances, for example.  The only absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example? Do you have a physical theory to go with that one?
</em><br>
<p>Quantum teleportation has been observed in the lab.  However, no one
<br>
knows how to precisely control it yet, nor does anyone have a line on
<br>
making it happen to a large number of atoms all at once.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This isn't alt.gee.whiz.wouldn't.it.be.nice.if.extropians, btw.
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't have to be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; limit on that line, barring time travel, is being able to move instantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; from one place to another...at which point, your per-stop time dominates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; your speed of colonization, so teleport masses of terraformig/industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; building/colonization nanites to your target to colonize your target in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; a blink, and speed up production of said nanites to lessen time between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; colonizations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) No evidence for such physics
</em><br>
<p>Except what has already been observed on Earth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) No evidence for anybody using such technology
</em><br>
<p>I, personally, find it more likely (definitely not provable, but more
<br>
likely) that no such colonization wave has passed us yet, if it even
<br>
exists.  I could be wrong, but that would definitely explain this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) Did I already mention 1) and 2)?
</em><br>
<p>Did I already answer them?  Keep your objections to the facts, and not
<br>
the emotions, or you may well miss that point or two about someone
<br>
else's opinion that keeps it from being the straw man you'd otherwise
<br>
perceive...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Assuming that physics is not changeable, of course, which is a rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; safe bet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Give me fixed physics and a sufficiently large amount of ingenuity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; resources, and I can get you practically anything.  (Some things are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such as relativity and breaking the speed of light in vacuum limit?
</em><br>
<p>...as exemplified by this comment.  To restate my point here: maybe one
<br>
can not accelerate to FTL, but that does not mean there is no way to go
<br>
from place X to place Y faster than light could.  It's just that the
<br>
forms of transit we now have can't do it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; impossible as is, but other things which serve the same ends as well or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; better are present for every human desire I've seen.  Even if sometimes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; the desire - say, colonization of the universe - must be unmasked from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; its expression - say, colonization of the universe with current
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; technology - in order to discern the best way to satisfy it.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would be foolish to assume that our current physics is accurate. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact we know it isn't. However, I would be doubly foolish to step
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond the known laws, and start extrapolating. There are a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these &quot;could be's&quot;, way more than there are neurons in my brain. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prefer to engage them for more fruitful speculations, e.g. what's for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dinner.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;shrugs&gt;  And I prefer to extrapolate from what is known, too.  I'm just
<br>
saying that as long as one of these &quot;could be&quot;, then it is invalid to
<br>
say that their opposite *must* be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; The Singularity, if it exists, doesn't peak.  It merely goes on until we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Singularity is a testable hypothesis about future civilisatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development. We will know it when we get there, and not before.
</em><br>
<p>By some definitions of Singularity, parts of our world are already
<br>
there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; advance our ways of thinking sufficiently that we can see the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; once more.  I base this claim on what I see every day, as some people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then why do you keep talking about things beyond the predictability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horizont? FTL, teleportation, fairies, the cow that jumped over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moon, ghosties &amp; goblins, ...
</em><br>
<p>My point is that it *is* beyond the predictability horizon, therefore
<br>
one can not at this time make valid predictions on it.  My second point
<br>
is that the predictability horizon keeps changing, and is different for
<br>
different aspects for different people.  2000 was once beyond the
<br>
predictability horizon; it is mostly history as of today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; think the immediate future is an unimaginable tech (u/dis)topia, until
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; they get handle on the realities of what's out there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, the truth is out there, somewhere, along with the Moon made from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; green cheese and the X files.
</em><br>
<p>The truth is what you and others make it be.  Not in terms of
<br>
propaganda, but in terms of shaping the world.  It's not (just) out
<br>
there, it's (also) in here.
