&quot;A symbolic expression that can be evaluated might represent

symbolically the end result of infinite iterations.  For example,
<br>
a way to measure the area under a curve is to split it into infinite
<br>
subsections and measure each and sum the area of them,
<br>
another way is to integrate the function, a finite computation.
<br>
I guess this is to say that just because a process might be infinite,
<br>
our brains can still get a handle to it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Your guess is interesting.

&quot;We have shown that it is impossible to collect more than
<br>
a finite amount of any quantity that scales as the (scale-factor)^3 .
<br>
However, the entropy density of the universe scales in this fashion.
<br>
Thus, independent of issues of whether there is infinite information
<br>
in an infinite universe, it is impossible to collect more than a finite
<br>
amount. Effectively even an infinite universe allows only a finite
<br>
computational system. The picture we have painted here is not
<br>
optimistic. If, as the current evidence suggests, we live in a cosmological
<br>
constant dominated universe, the boundaries of empirical knowledge
<br>
will continue to decrease with time. The universe will become noticeably
<br>
less observable on a time-scale which is fathomable.
<br>
Moreover, in such a universe, the days - either literal or metaphorical -
<br>
are numbered for every civilization. More generally, perhaps surprisingly,
<br>
we find that eternal sentient material life is implausible in any universe.
<br>
The eternal expansion which Dyson found so appealing is a chimera.&quot;
<br>
Is it possible to collect the full amount of information? I hope so.
<br>
We can get deep informations, at least mathematically.
