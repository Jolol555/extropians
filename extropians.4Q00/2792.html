<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't want to waste time on semantical arguments here ...
</em><br>
<p>Pursuant to this I'd like to strip away some of the limiting ideological
<br>
garbage found in this conversation.
<br>
<p><p>I think you're reading too much into what I'm saying Steve.  Let's try to
<br>
keep this simple.
<br>
<p>By definition, &quot;limiting belief structures&quot; are -limiting.-  In some way.
<br>
Now, in many cases we can objectively determine the general impact of these
<br>
limitations and assign a general consequence to the persistence of such.
<br>
<p>For instance:
<br>
<p>The Jehovah's Witness' are averse to blood transfusions.  JW Betty requires
<br>
a blood transfusion to live.  Facilities exist to undertake the procedure in
<br>
a timely fashion.  In the absence of her ability to remove and/or
<br>
&quot;hack-around&quot; (oh, just this one time,) her ideology, she will die.
<br>
<p><p>Or:
<br>
<p>Joe is a talented, intelligent introvert, and, like most humans, has an
<br>
unfortified self-esteem.  Joe holds the belief that &quot;doing nothing&quot; is
<br>
better than publicly failing in the attempt.  Joe procrastinates his goals.
<br>
Joe puts off that book he wants to write until &quot;he has a firmer grasp on
<br>
it.&quot;  Joe doesn't talk to the nice girl in the checkout line.
<br>
<p><p>Or:
<br>
<p>Theo believes that a passing comet is an alien space-ship, which he can
<br>
board by means of destroying his earth-bound material existence...
<br>
<p><p><p>Now, we can debate whether a particular belief structure is limiting or
<br>
advantageous, but if we -agree- that a particular belief structure is
<br>
limiting, wouldn't you also hold that striping away such an ideology is of
<br>
benefit?
<br>
<p><p><p>but we have
<br>
<em>&gt; may differing concepts of &quot;belief&quot; ... which I think of as being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional/subconscious to a greater degree than they are explitic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and articulated. The notion of stripping away belief structures is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less valid than notions of excorcising psychological imbalance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (through hypnosis and psychotherapy).
</em><br>
<p>Well, it sounds like your saying that the notion of &quot;stripping away&quot; is
<br>
unfeasible, rather than undesirable.  I am not a therapist, nor am I a
<br>
psychologist or neuro-scientist.  So, I can't really speak with intelligence
<br>
on this topic.  I defer expertise of &quot;the means&quot; to those in the know.  You
<br>
can consider my arguments as addressing &quot;the ends.&quot;
<br>
<p>Desirable ends:  Removal of limiting belief structures.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, I happen to think all the main world religions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectually &quot;wrong&quot; in making their various supernatural claims. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who follow these religions do so for social and emotional reasons,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not open to persuasion out of their faiths by intellectual argument alone.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I have never addressed the means in this discussion.  Who says that
<br>
we need to use 'intellectual argument'?
<br>
<p>However, I would be interested in attempting a reverse-conversion (if I
<br>
thought it would have a pleasant outcome.)  Rational people can often
<br>
respond to rational arguments, despite powerful beliefs if the arguments are
<br>
given with patience and in a spirit of compassion.  This I know.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;In any case, observationally your belief is clearly wrong-- or do you not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;see millions of ongoing examples of individual humans falling prey to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;limiting belief structures?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are inserting a value judgement &quot;falling prey&quot; to &quot;limiting&quot; beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairy stories &amp;c. can be very comforting for individuals, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits may outweigh the intellectual doubts.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that we should engage in a cost benefit analysis in making these
<br>
decisions.  I probably disagree with the value of a large number of people
<br>
holding fairy tale beliefs for the sake of comfort.
<br>
<p>Curious, when I abandoned my religion, I found I was quickly able to take
<br>
equal (or greater) comfort in my own capabilities as a human being as I ever
<br>
received from the impression that my life was being watched over by a
<br>
benevolent care-taker.  (I appreciate, however, that people are different.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Huh?  I -do- have an ego (it's true) but in what fashion have you seen it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;reflected unflatteringly in my previous post?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Simply the over-concern with and drive for personal power .... I suffer
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; this trait also on occasions.
</em><br>
<p>Uh-oh... rant coming up...
<br>
<p>Tut-tut!  Steve!  Please don't be one of -those- people!
<br>
<p>I refer you to Nelson Mandela's 1994 Inaugural Speech:
<br>
<a href="http://www.wildghost.com/mandela.htm">http://www.wildghost.com/mandela.htm</a>
<br>
(For the relgiosity averse: replace &quot;God&quot; with &quot;Life&quot;)
<br>
<p>Also, uh, I hate to say it, but your comments above are an example of what
<br>
I'm talking about.  We have a fear of empowering ourselves-- perhaps we fear
<br>
that we are not responsible enough to deal with it?  (Then we need to
<br>
empower our responsibility!)
<br>
<p>Remember, personal power is not a bad thing.  You -are- looking to re-invent
<br>
yourself as a posthuman entity, aren't you?  Aren't you trying to defeat
<br>
death, liberate your existence from poverty, war, hate and hunger?  Isn't
<br>
Transhumanism the ultimate manifestation of the empowerment of the human?
<br>
<p>I'm talking about -increasing- one's drive for personal power.  Not
<br>
deflating it (like so many societal factors seem to do.)  I think we should
<br>
undertake that goal in a spirit of compassion, as I've stated, but do not
<br>
shrink away from the brass ring!  Do not believe yourself unworthy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;As a therapist, sometimes I find it good to
<br>
<em>&gt; boost the self-esteem and sense of worth of a client (ego-strengthening,
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; Western way) and sometimes it might be useful to deflate the ego and stand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back (ego-dissolution, the Eastern way).
</em><br>
<p>The ability to dissolve one's ego is -also- an expression of personal power.
<br>
This is a paradox/truth.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;You're going to make me do this again, ain'tcha?  Okay...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Environments have decreased relevancy to our existence is we don't
</em><br>
actually
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;get to &quot;mentally interface&quot; with them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, aeons ago our ancestors' behaviour was governed by sunlight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &amp; the primal eye, whereas nowadays our E-1 brains have infinite-state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capability (self-organising) since they are no longer governed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (primal eye) external clock.
</em><br>
<p>Gobbledegook.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;I'm not talking Rocket Science (tm) here either-- simply: a) be aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of how we are capable of interacting with reality, and be) take advantage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it to optimise our existence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can't &quot;interface&quot; with reality directly .. merely model it and make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representations ... as well as painting it/ writing music/ explore it thru
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science &amp;c.
</em><br>
<p>Ugh.  Whatever.  Again, again.  Fine ---&gt; &quot;a) be aware of how we are capable
<br>
of *indirectly* interfacing with reality.&quot;
<br>
<p>You're aware, I hope, that your persistence in adding additional levels of
<br>
abstraction does not invalidate my statements.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It seems to me that most roles &amp; beviour are &quot;learnt&quot; at some stage on
</em><br>
some
<br>
<em>&gt; level, and thus all our behaviour is &quot;pretence&quot; or acting&quot; even if we
</em><br>
often
<br>
<em>&gt; successfully disguise this pretence from ourselves! The best liars are
</em><br>
those
<br>
<em>&gt; who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can convince themselves of their lies.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I say: &quot;whatever.&quot;  If all behavior is &quot;pretense,&quot; then -that's- what
<br>
behavior is.  We live in a state of pretense-- that doesn't bother me.  But
<br>
is it useful pretense?  Behavioral 'truth' is a pretty darn grey subject,
<br>
wouldn't you agree?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All I am saying is (1) understand this, and (2) use it to your advantage
</em><br>
by
<br>
<em>&gt; writing and editing your own script, don't pretend to be a character that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others have scripted for you. There are better things to be than &quot;human&quot;
</em><br>
..
<br>
<em>&gt; this is just a tired old legacy label ... but then presumably we are all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after/trans-human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and agree with this statement?
</em><br>
<p>Hey, you took the words right out of my mouth.
