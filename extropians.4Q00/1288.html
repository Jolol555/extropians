<p><p><em>&gt;We also have all heard that the bible actually does set the value of pi to

<p><em>&gt;3.  I have looked this up and find this to be false.  The actual verse
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;describes a basin 10 cubits across and 30 cubits around.  This would make pi
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; 3 if a circle's circumference was 3 times its diameter.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The diameter should have been 0.45 cubits (or 8.1 inches) shorter to make pi
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;come out accurately. However, this is a huge basin 15 feet (or 10 cubits)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;across.  Its diameter was measured &quot;from lip to lip&quot; of the basin.  If the
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;lips added 4 inches (or 0.225 cubits) on each side, the measurements would
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;be accurate.  A 4 inch lip on a 15 foot basin is not unlikely.  As far as I
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;can tell, there is no discrepancy in these measurements. 
</em><br>
<p>No: the stated diameter is too long.  If it's an interior diameter, it should 
<br>
have
<br>
been shorter yet, so 10 cubits is even further off.  The basin would have
<br>
to have a lip *negative* 4 inches wide to make the measurements right.
<br>
I'd like to see that mold! ;-)
<br>
<p>And what's it made of?  Presumably negative-weight matter!  If we could but
<br>
find it we could build that time-travel machine.
<br>
<p>You're right about the bible not saying pi is 3; for the reasons you state, 
<br>
the
<br>
bible is actually saying pi is between 0 and 3.
