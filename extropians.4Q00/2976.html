Hi Extropes
<br>
<p>I was cleaning up some files on my hard disk, and I ran across the
<br>
following file, written by an acquaintence many years ago. Since
<br>
I was thinking of the whole &quot;None of the Above&quot; voting procedure
<br>
recently, I thought I'd post it for fun.
<br>
<p>It is still appropriate after all of these years, wouldn't you say?
<br>
<p>(even if the tone is a bit.. uhmm..  biting .. so then tongue-in-cheek humor)
<br>
