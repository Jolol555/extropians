<p><em>    &gt;Big Deal versus Bigtime: When Billy or Gore bogarted
</em><br>
<p>Bogarted? That word is a bit too klognee for my taste, I think you should
<br>
be a little bit more dyphysatory.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;and W'ya snorted; they  were YOUNG MEN.
</em><br>
<p>and the difference being .... By the way, if Sagan advocated political positions you
<br>
agreed with do you expect us to believe there is a snowball's chance in hell of you ever
<br>
raising this ridiculous issue?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Regards defeating a Soviet Missile attack using 1980 technology, you jump to  conclusion
</em><br>
<p>Huh? What conclusion did I jump to?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Now there were a few methods we might have tried and did not,
</em><br>
<p>There are an infinite number of very expensive things we could have tried and absolutely
<br>
no evidence any of them are worth more than a bucket of warm spit.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;90% because the Politics changed we do not have a  Balistic Missile Defense
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;system.
</em><br>
<p>You are wrong, it's 100% due to politics. If politicians insisted we have star wars then we'd have
<br>
the stupid white elephant, no doubt about it.  However the reason we don't have an EFFECTIVE
<br>
missile defense is 100% due to technology.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Will you also now say that we do not drive around on fuel cells
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;or have a lunar colony &quot;because the technology didn't work&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Yes. The technology has not advanced enough for them to make economic sense.
<br>
There is no military or scientific reason for them to be worth doing either.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Sagan had his  biases
</em><br>
<p>Yea, he thought human extinction wouldn't be much fun, what a weirdo.
