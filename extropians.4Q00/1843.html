<p>I can't follow your argument.  Yes of course our preferences evolved to
<br>
be adaptive to our ancestors' environment.  And if so then artificially
<br>
changing our actions, relative to those we prefer, would make us less
<br>
adaptive if we were still in our ancestors' environment.
<br>
<p>But you seem to accept that our environment has changed greatly since
<br>
our preferences evolved.  And the paper isn't about what is adaptive
<br>
anyway - it is about what would satisfy the preferences we have, however
<br>
we got them and however adaptive they are.
