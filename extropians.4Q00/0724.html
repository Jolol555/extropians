<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; The biggest problem is that the victim is lost forever, as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;result I do not believe the killer should be allowed to live, nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;be suspended, I believe they should be treated equally with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;victim.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Interesting. Does this belief follow logically from an axiom or is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;this belief itself an axiom?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not believe in life after death. I therefore believe that when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone dies and the structure of the brain decays, they are lost.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, but that is a separate axiom from...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It follows axiomatically that I believe the killer suffer an equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fate.
</em><br>
<p>...this. The no life after death axiom I understand, because it 
<br>
meshes with my own Ockham's Razor axiom. The &quot;eye for an eye&quot; axiom
<br>
I don't understand. But then again, I guess that's why they're 
<br>
axioms. They don't need a rational basis; one has to have *some*
<br>
arbitrary point of reference (cf. Existentialism Plus).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;If there was a technology for &quot;fixing what's wrong&quot; with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;perpetrator, would you be in favor of allowing the perpetrator to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;opt for this treatment?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This does not equate to justice for the loss of the victim, so the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer is no.
</em><br>
<p>It would be interesting to speculate on the evolutionary origins of
<br>
this 'justice' meme, and how widespread it is. Do we agree, though,
<br>
that it exists at a level that doesn't run quite as deep as the
<br>
'survival', 'expansion', and 'opimization' memes?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;If the 'non-homicidal' portions of the perpetrator's brain could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be extracted and used for some productive purpose instead of just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;becoming worm-food (3D modeller in a vat?) would you be in favor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of such an extraction?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Being unsure of the granularity of the brain, this is a difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question, as long as the personnality (sense of self?) of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original killer is irrevocably destroyed I suppose.
</em><br>
<p>This is a third axiom-- that if the 'homicidal' and 'non-homicidal'
<br>
portions of a perpetrator's brain can be separated, then 'homicidal'
<br>
portion also *must* be the one that houses the sense of self, the
<br>
identity. Unlike the other two axioms-- no life after death, and eye
<br>
for an eye, this axiom just might be overturned by future discoveries
<br>
in neuropsychology.
<br>
<p>When an axiom contradicts scientific findings, there emerges a conflict
<br>
between it and the scientific method axiom. So, if evidence starts to
<br>
accumulate that any human brain can be nudged into a state conducive to
<br>
cold-blooded murder, or conversely if it is demonstrated that removing
<br>
a particular tangle of neurons will make a person incapable of killing,
<br>
that will open quite a can of worms, won't it?
<br>
<p>Please don't be offended by my cross examination, btw. I'm partly playing
<br>
devil's advocate to learn more about your point of view.
