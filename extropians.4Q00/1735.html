<p>Heh.  At a Flag Day open house at Peterson AFB around 15 years ago, they
<br>
had a Stinger missile training simulator which they allowed the public
<br>
to handle.  The NCO in charge was not amused when I tracked a commercial
<br>
airliner with it...
<br>
<p>Propulsion is what I know, guidance can be a bear.  On the gripping
<br>
hand, video cameras and image processors are cheap and getting cheaper. 
<br>
Hell, pigeons were trained to peck at the image of an aircraft or ship
<br>
by BF Skinner 60 years ago.  The project wasn't completed, but they
<br>
could have had precision guided munitions (pigeon guided munitions?) in
<br>
the 1940s.
