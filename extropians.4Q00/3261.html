<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Someone who prefers powerful information to free information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Implying somehow that free information is less powerful than hidden info?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not necessarily, but rather that the usefulness/value/power of information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is more important to me than its &quot;freeness.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>If it is not free (speech not beer), not open, then there are limits on
<br>
your ability to fully utilize it.  If you are interested in it being
<br>
more powerful then you are interested in it being more  open/free. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If so, how?  Why?  Examples please.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Laws of scarcity.  Maybe you think it would be nice if every kid on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet could have a mint copy of Action Comics #1, but you can't argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a distribution wouldn't destroy an interesting market.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Irrelevant to the discussion.  A first edition is a material artifact. 
<br>
It is not information but a given physical embodiment in a particular
<br>
form produced at a particular time.  It cannot be duplicated by
<br>
definition.  But every kid can have a copy of the contents of that first
<br>
edition.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Further, while there is value in information being known, there is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value in secrets-- and information that I know that you do not is often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequentially more powerful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That very much depends.  You hoard some of your info for your supposed
<br>
advantage.  I hoard some of mine.  As a result each of us expends extra
<br>
effort to duplicate some of what others have.  And the information that
<br>
is unique to each of us can't  be recombined to produce new and novel
<br>
and perhaps even more powerful information.  The equation is not
<br>
simple.  
<br>
<p>Yes there is a place for secrets - in war or the equivalent, one's
<br>
personal information and affairs.  But in peace and in non-personal
<br>
information, the maximal power and good of each of us is highly
<br>
dependent on the free flow of information.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; For instance-- I know the password to my bank account and you do not.  As a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result of the security afforded by this state of affairs, I decide to store
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my funds in said account.  The password information is now powerful-- it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grants access to my money.  In the absence of my ability to keep this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information secret, I will not store my funds in such a manner, and password
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information is suddenly valueless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Your password is also not relevant.  This is a key designed to protect a
<br>
personal asset.  It is no more information in the sense under discussion
<br>
than  your housekey is.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Someone who prefers personal empowerment to the empowerment of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; collective.
</em><br>
<p>In the world of information this boundary between you and them, or more
<br>
precisely, this chopping up of the information commons into &quot;yours&quot; and
<br>
&quot;theirs&quot; often harms each and every one of us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's not really what I'm saying, but I do sort of agree with this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion.  What I'm really saying is that control over information is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desirable, as is access to information.  Easily replicating information is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desirable, as is secure information.  The ability to discover secrets is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desirable, as is the ability to create them.  Information is powerful, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in many cases that power derives from secure ownership (as per my password
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example above, for instance.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There is a vast difference between secure ownership of money or goods,
<br>
or even ownership of personal information crucial to privacy and
<br>
claiming ownership of algorithms, data and so on.  Creative works are in
<br>
a slightly different category in my opinion although some of the changes
<br>
brought about by the information age also change quite a bit about
<br>
music, literary works and so on and the rights and obligations of all
<br>
involved.
