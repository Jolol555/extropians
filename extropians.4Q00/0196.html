after

during
<br>

<p>Thanks for the reality check concerning modern warfare and its methodologies.
<br>
I've never trusted anyone who advocates waging war along the lines of ideology
<br>
or religion. Waging technological war to see who can win seems less insane, but
<br>
it could conceivably be even more devastating. When prophets of Armageddon want
<br>
to fulfill prophesies via war *and* technology, I think it's time to deprogram
<br>
soldiers before they kill us all.
