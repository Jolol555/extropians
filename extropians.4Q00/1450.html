<em>&gt;From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20JOIN%20THE%20EXI!%20FUND%20THE%20REVOLUTION!&In-Reply-To=&lt;F105I5RxGwIPvlKWzqJ0000171e@hotmail.com&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt;You don't join the Extropy Institute to get all the valuable membership
</em><br>
<em>&gt;benefits, because you're right; there aren't any.  You join ExI to help 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fund
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the revolution.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never realized.  Is that official ExI policy?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's just like sending money to CARE or the Red Cross or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something,
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case, wouldn't it be better not to call it &quot;membership&quot;?  
<br>
Perhaps there could be some kind of slogan at the site, like: &quot;Don't give 
<br>
your contribution to CARE or the Red Cross -- give your contribution to us, 
<br>
and help fund the revolution.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this had been what it had said at the Extropy site, I would not have 
<br>
complained that I don't get anything for my membership fee.  Then again, I 
<br>
would never have sent it in if that is what it had said at the Extropy site.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;the difference being that (a) your dollars accomplish around a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hundred times as much; and (b) you get to put &quot;Member, Extropy Institute&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your web page or signature line.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stupid me -- I never thought to take advantage of that benefit while I 
<br>
was a member, and now it is too late.  Or is it?  Who knows?  It is probably 
<br>
just as difficult to find out whether I am not a member as it was to receive 
<br>
confirmation that I was a member.   If people want to pay just for being 
<br>
able to put &quot;Member, Extropy Institute&quot; in their signature line, they should 
<br>
be warned that besides money, it also takes half a year of writing to 
<br>
Extropy officials before they get to know whether they are members or not.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian
