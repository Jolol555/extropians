<p>
I will not rise to any of Michael's tempting bait (yum), but there's a
<br>
nugget of gold here:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a significant difference between individualism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socio/psychological killers, liberty is not about nihilism.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely true, and I never said it was.
<br>
<p>I will repeat what I said, broken down, with annotation: 
<br>
1) Pure individualism        &lt;do what thou wilt, plain and simple&gt;
<br>
2) in its rawest form        &lt;hmm... what the *hell* is going on? looks
<br>
weird to me&gt;
<br>
3) is hard to distinguish    &lt;not impossible, _hard_ for J. Random
<br>
person on the street&gt;
<br>
4) from psychopathology      &lt;bad craziness&gt;
<br>
5) unless the observer       &lt;the person trying to gauge how to respond&gt;
<br>
6) has confidence            &lt;justified or not&gt;
<br>
7) in the shared values      &lt;I figure most people will eat the pie, not
<br>
throw it in my face&gt;
<br>
8) of the observed.          &lt;the person doing what he wilt&gt;
<br>
<p>Pick any part of this apart, Michael. Please go by the numbers, there
<br>
are a lot of assumptions and nominalizations here; I hope you won't
<br>
waste time quibbling over semantics.
<br>
<p>I mean, really, haven't you ever freaked a mundane? You know what I'm
<br>
talking about, don't you?
