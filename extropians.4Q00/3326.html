<p>Yes, you are right, of course. Nevertheless, we can't be concerned about
<br>
what people think about us if that interferes with our doing what we truly

think we ought to do.

============================
<br>
&quot;To find out what you love to do demands a great deal of intelligence;
<br>
because, if you are afraid of not being able to earn a livelihood, or of
<br>
not fitting into this rotten society, then you will never find out. But,
<br>
if you are not frightened, if you refuse to be pushed into the groove of
<br>
tradition by your parents, by your teachers, by the superficial demands of
<br>
society, then there is a possibility of discovering what it is you really
<br>
love to do. So, to discover, there must be no fear of not surviving.&quot;
<br>
--J. Krishnamurti (1895 - 1986)
