<p>
Altered concuisness; a favorite subject.
<br>
<p>Thinking outside the box, it seems that new, grander
<br>
perceptions often seem to form a larger &quot;box&quot;.
<br>
The task now is to completely obliterate the
<br>
boundaries of perception, trancend the prison
<br>
of societal conditioning and unlearn the imposed
<br>
concensus reality.
<br>
Every so often the status quo must be challenged.
<br>
<p>When one percieves connections while &quot;tripping&quot;
<br>
which did not appear apparent prior to the experience
<br>
it is often, I believe, a result of the breakdown
<br>
of that which has been learned. When reality is in
<br>
question, is when the real learning begins.
<br>
If one is not prepared for this, it can be rather
<br>
disturbing and may result in a &quot;bad trip&quot;.
<br>
<p>A trip is like binary fractal feedback, all sensory 
<br>
input is looped back upon itself and reconsidered
<br>
repeatedly along with internal input, resulting in
<br>
hallucinations, visual and auditory trailors, and 
<br>
essentially a questioning af all that one considers
<br>
true.
<br>
<p>Flashbacks have usually been very mild reminders 
<br>
of the sensations experienced while under the 
<br>
influence and short lived for the most part. Further, 
<br>
after a brief moment of meditation  on hallucinogenic 
<br>
sensations, one can enduce them in ones own mind, 
<br>
even if it's been several years since any have been 
<br>
used. 
<br>
Simply writing on the subject causes mild flashbacks.
<br>
<p>Lately I've found that a few deep breaths,
<br>
complete relaxation and focus almost places me
<br>
in a trance in which I find it effortless to accell
<br>
at any task, be it chess, typing, marksmanship,
<br>
programming or inducing lucid dreams, whatever.
<br>
<p>Sometimes, it seems that I can transmit ideas to
<br>
another person simply by concintrating - makes
<br>
me a little paraniod that others are reading my 
<br>
mind - but that's stretchning it. 
<br>
<p>Happy Hunting!
<br>
Nate
