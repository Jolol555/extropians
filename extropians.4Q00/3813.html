<em>&gt;OK, lets get this straight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Chris, you would allow someone to do a copy upload, then kill your physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(current) body. Is that right?
</em><br>
<p>As I've mentioned, this wouldn't be my first choice.  Slow uploading 
<br>
has the benefit of not triggering my survival instincts...
<br>
<p>... but yes, I would allow destruction of the original in the copy process.
<br>
<p>If I someday have a brain death and resuscitation experience as 
<br>
described by others in this thread, that's effectively what would 
<br>
happen.
<br>
<p>If I someday allow myself to be teleported in a Star Trekesque 
<br>
fashion, that's effectively what would happen.
<br>
<p>If I someday allow my body and mind to be cryogenically stored for 
<br>
later revival, that's effectively what would happen.
<br>
<p>My brain has been replaced atom by atom my whole life.  Pretending 
<br>
that there's a real difference if it happened much faster or even all 
<br>
at once would seem to be an intellectual dishonesty.
<br>
<p>For all I know, this process happens every time I go to sleep at 
<br>
night.  Little fairies may be copying me every time I lose 
<br>
consciousness.
<br>
<p>In a universe where the dead don't weep for themselves any more than 
<br>
a snakes' discarded skin has any regrets, the only thing important to 
<br>
me is that my thoughts and memories live on.
<br>
<p>I admit it.  That in itself is a sentimental wish - as much of a 
<br>
sentimental wish as thinking that the world needs me in it today or 
<br>
even that the world has &quot;needs&quot; at all.
<br>
<p>Rather than digress into a completely nihilistic stance, I choose to 
<br>
allow myself that sentimentality. :)
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
