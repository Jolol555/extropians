Amara forwards, from the May 2000 Physics Today,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now an emeritus professor at Princeton's Institute for Advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Studies, Dyson is perhaps best known to physicists for synthesizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into quantum electrodynamics the seemingly conflicting theories of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. He's gained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a wider audience among the lay public with his books, beginning in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1979 with _Disturbing the Universe_. His writings, he notes, &quot;have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite a lot to do with ethics, and to some extent with religion as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>It's funny that they should mention his wider audience, without also
<br>
referring to what I would think is his best known idea, the Dyson sphere.
<br>
It made it into Star Trek and lots of science fiction.  Engineering,
<br>
even on the grand scale, seems rather mundane compared to lofty ideas
<br>
about religion and ethics, I suppose.
<br>
<p>Dyson is also well known among Extropians for his speculative
<br>
extrapolations of physical conditions in the distant future, if the
<br>
universe is expanding.  These have been investigated in more detail by
<br>
Frank Tipler, of course, and recently Krauss and Starkman.
<br>
