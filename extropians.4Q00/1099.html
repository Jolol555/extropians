</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; ungodly ugliness or other and then sends this thing as a dumb, dead file

</em><br>
<em>&gt; render the thing locally even though most of the brains (what little
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; page whose data is all collected by and at the server and whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presentation is described and painfully built by the server. 
</em><br>
<p>You are abosolutely right on this one. Of course, this is not currently
<br>
possible, but I know for a fact that this sort of client-side
<br>
functionality is being developed. Slash is a better-than-nothing
<br>
solution, something we have at hand right now. I'm not claiming that
<br>
it's a final answer. However, experimenting with Slash will allow those
<br>
working on this other project to learn more about what users need and
<br>
want. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now I know that today there are a lot of people doing things a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smarter.  Like sending XML data up and having it locally rendered.  Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them are even using Java or something better to do the rendering. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which gets a bit better.  But too many are using yet more layers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obfuscation (XSLT, CSS) to get around to doing a half-assed job at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something Smalltalk  programmers did well (pluggable views) a long time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago.  I used to subscribe to an XSL[T} list.  But it was much too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depressing reading endless posts about people attempting to do simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming tasks in something not at all made for it.  Why do people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buy some half-ass language or hype of the day and try to make it do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything?  
</em><br>
<p>A question well worth asking, especially from the brain trust that is
<br>
this list. IMO, the challenge is to separate the content from the
<br>
formatting just as content-formatting have been separated from the
<br>
protocol and application layers. Have all text be as no-frills,
<br>
standardized, and machine readable as possible. Then have all the 
<br>
bells and whistles rendered by the client, the aggregator, the portal,
<br>
the whatever intercepts this content... in a manner that is reversible
<br>
so something downstream from it can easily reconstruct the original
<br>
content.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And exactly why is it that my 650Mhz+ machines with 10s of gigs of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; storage are not being utilized for better UI experience, local caching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of data and code fragments and so on?  Treat me as a &quot;thin client&quot; when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm on a cell phone or my palm pilot but not when I have that kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local power.  It is a stupid waste.  We clog the internet with page
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after page to be drawn on machines most of which could calculate their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own pages from data kept in synch with its remote sources with far less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traffic on the net and a far richer user experience and MUCH faster.  
</em><br>
<p>P2P is a good idea. Again, something that's being worked on by a number
<br>
of groups, and that I'm dying to see become more commonplace.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The Web as such is not the problem.  Falling for hype and forgetting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think or to dream up better solutions using all the resources at your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disposal is.  I have no problem with something that does every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functional thing the web does.  I have a big problem with its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dysfunctional aspects and with people and companies literally refusing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to think outside of the box called the WEB.  &quot;The customers won't buy it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we do anything but HTTP for our GUI.&quot;  &quot;The customer won't buy our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; server if it isn't Microsoft.&quot; &quot;The customer definitely won't buy our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; server if it isn't written in pure Java.&quot;  Balderdash.  Give a business
</em><br>
<p>Word up! Yes, bravo. Thank you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; tools it can use to be many times more effective than its competitors at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a fraction of the cost and they will be lined up at your door.  Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course you have to find the people in the business actually capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking vs. simply repeating what they read.
</em><br>
<p>However, ignoring the inertia and existing technology investment of
<br>
your users is a good way to get Macintoshed or Betamaxed. The ideal
<br>
solution to the web's problems is something that will seamlessly
<br>
integrate into and eventually replace the prevailing paradigm instead
<br>
of attempting to singlehandedly blow it to smithereens. The most
<br>
crucial (and neglected) part of a technological revolution is a
<br>
feasible path from here to there.  That's why one of the starting
<br>
points is Slash. If people out there actually have applications that
<br>
can take Slash articles/postings over an HTTP port in XML format and do
<br>
something useful with them, it's certainly doable to expand the range
<br>
of Slash's XML offerings (yes, Slash already presents certain content
<br>
in XML format... have a look at <a href="http://www.extrodot.org/articles.xml">http://www.extrodot.org/articles.xml</a>)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let's see.  I can pick up  IDE space at around 40 gigs for $300 or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less.  My time runs around $80+/hour currently.  So about 4 hours net of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time wasted putting up with someone else's organization of the data and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waiting for them to render it in the ways their server knows how to and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to deliver it a piece at a time over the net to me vs. spending that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; four hours of earnings for enough space to store huge libraries of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information locally.  I can see going to other machines (but much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiently) for new fresh information.  But going to them to get stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that hasn't changed?  What for?  Disks are cheap, time is expensive.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remote database/repository is nice for sure but I want my own not little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; links to everyone's own web-ified offerings of information. I'm sitting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right on top of a fiber installation at work and on 780K bi-directional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DSL at home.  I can afford to download all the original data and updates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I need.  On the road I could link to my own server and see things in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form that I want it.  
</em><br>
<p>As above, we agree on this issue. The world needs a standardized,
<br>
machine readable text format, to which all kinds of arbitrary &quot;layers&quot;
<br>
of formatting can be applied and unapplied by arbitrary intermediaries
<br>
and end-users. XML is probably fine for the job. 
<br>
<p>The next step is to design server and client software that can handle
<br>
this. Preferrably software that will integrate into existing HTTPd
<br>
implementations and existing browsers, so that we're not reinventing
<br>
the wheel. I have my opinions on the best sequence of steps to take,
<br>
but if you can come up with a better one, I'd love to hear it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I'm a digital pack rat. I don't trust content to be there tomorrow

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; naked .html, txt, .ps.gz and .pdf
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Excuse my ignorance but what is a &quot;squid&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, this squid thing is beginning to sound like something nice to have.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; Opera is not quite there yet when it comes to stability (but it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; making good progress), nor is Galeon (also almost there). However, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem is principal. You can't render complex content in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sustainably stable fashion, using state of the art software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; development. On the other hand, I can rely on the average software to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; render simple content (ASCII) reliably.
</em><br>
<p>ASCII is less simple and reliable than you might think. Have you ever
<br>
tried to come up with a really foolproof automated way to even do
<br>
something as simple as break up paragraphs, strip out signatures,
<br>
identify duplicates based on content alone, and parse out quotes? Have
<br>
you ever tried to automatically split up the articles being pushed to
<br>
you by several *different* email newsletters? 
<br>
<p>So yes, push is a good idea (but I still say the distinction between
<br>
push and pull is in our own heads). A simple, universal content format
<br>
is a good idea (though XML is a better candidate than just raw text).
<br>
However, email is a deeply flawed medium. Its threaded nature forces
<br>
you to think in terms of a one-to-one relationship between message and
<br>
response, whereas its really many to one or even many to many. It
<br>
discourages forming connections to things outside email-space.  Email
<br>
is a sedimentary rather than an additive medium. In other words, once
<br>
you post an email message you have little incentive to update it, issue
<br>
new revisions, incorporate reader feedback. You just let it get buried
<br>
under strata of new email, where you and everyone else will forget it.
<br>
Its hard to back-track an email post to what it's referring to, unlike
<br>
links/backlinks. Finally, there is lack of categorization. Web pages have
<br>
titles, and increasingly META tags. They tend to be linked to related 
<br>
web pages. Email, however, is at best linked to whatever it's responding
<br>
to and tends to inherit the Subject: line of its thread. You'll rarely
<br>
see a web-page entitled-- 
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes, but... (Was: [Re: Church of the Subgenius (was Gun Control and Gover)]&quot;
<br>
<p>Please don't propose netiquette as a solution. If netiquette worked, we
<br>
wouldn't be having this part of the converastion.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Actually you can come a lot closer if you keep the data (model)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively straightforward in terms of knows sets of meta protocols it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employs and have a stable set of widgets and view thingies that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might add experimental things to now and then with fallbacks to simpler
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones plus some decent streamable scripting support (both to run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpreters and embed code and support dynamic configuration).  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of the complexity  in a mulit-user environment is in concurrency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and transaction type issues and in other goodies like failover,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replication and security.  Some parts of transactional processing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (especially long transactions and non-standard models of concurrency)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are research topics.  But the simpler things should not be what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causing unpredictability as is the case largely today.  The simpler
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things also should not be eating up ungodly amounts of bandwidth.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of all the simpler things should be consuming the majority of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming talent.  When you see that happen something is obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong.
</em><br>
<p>No argument here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, HTML is a bastardized subset of SGML (or was).  SGML does give the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real presentation and typography stuff.  It would have been really good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if actual display PostScript was used to model a lot of the rendering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff and dependably customize it.  At the time it came out HTML was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable compromise for getting people sharing a lot of content over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the internet.  But we lost sight of what was and wasn't good about it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and made it a matter of religion to do all things for all people through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HTTP.  
</em><br>
<p>Uh uh uh! Not to nitpick but HTML != HTTP. Let's leave protocols out of this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; XML is getting made to complex imho.  The basic idea is fairly simple. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Except it ignored some simply facts in its early design like the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that most data exists in the form of a general graph rather than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hierarchy.  It is taking a really long time for them to get over that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and fix it rather than conveniently ignoring it much of the time.  Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the official standard parsers are braindead in that a 15 meg XML data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stream will blow up into 200 megs or so in memory using most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementations of DOM (well, under Java anyway).  And people got so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hooked on human readability they didn't bother to take XML data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description or DTD and compress the actual data into some predictable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; binary format that is more efficient to transmit and decipher given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta information and perhaps a bit of indexing at the front.  Worse of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all are the people who want to take perfectly good (well, maybe a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too bloated) RPC and CORBA and COM pipes and turn it all into XML.  
</em><br>
<p>To what extent are the examples you gave examples of XML abuse rather
<br>
than XML shortcomings?  What would be better than XML? What
<br>
characteristics should such a language have?  It goes without saying
<br>
that it should be machine readable/writable. How important is human
<br>
readability/writability?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; with this point in the first place. Tell me more about your filters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; They may already exist as features, or they may be relatively easy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; implement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How about implementing general scripting based filters and let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half-clueful users provide their own filters written in the script?  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would vote for Scheme or Python based scripting myself.  So you need an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpreter and a sandbox and some reasonable API for getting at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information on your site as information/data.  
</em><br>
<p>Separate questions. We already have everything we need to output content 
<br>
from Extrodot as information/data-- XML, RDF, ASCII, MySQL dump... you 
<br>
name it, it can probably be done. If there is enough demand to divert
<br>
the necessary brain-cycles from The Goal.
<br>
<p>As for filtering, that's a tougher question. The filtering task can be
<br>
split between Extrodot and your machine... some coarse filtering
<br>
functionality could be implemented &quot;server&quot; side and the finer-grained,
<br>
computationally expensive stuff could be implemented at the &quot;client&quot;
<br>
side, and I won't have to care what language you use for filtering. For
<br>
&quot;server&quot; side, the syntax would probably be either that of Perl or SQL,
<br>
since that's what the front-end and back-end run on respectively. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; I leave everybody with this question to ponder:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Is there an inherent difference between push and pull media, or is this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; difference arbitrary, artifactual, and potentially transparent to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; user in the same way as &quot;static location vs. search query&quot; or &quot;local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; volume vs. distributed file system&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Push and pull aren't terribly relevant to me.  What I really want are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems that make the walls disappear.  I would like to not need to
</em><br>
<p>Same here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; think much about whether the data, objects, functionality I am dealing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with is on my machine, your machine, all of our machines or what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer language it is in or what database vendor product and on and on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it goes.  I would like to see information/objects/fucntionality helped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be rearranged and duplicated and migrated to best balance the load
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamically.  I think a big mistake &quot;server&quot; or &quot;website&quot; people make is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assuming they more or less own the information and are the determiners
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of how others access it.  At most they give some particular views onto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information.  But this functionality should not make it impossible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get to the informationa and bits of the functionality to use them in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other and new ways.  I'm probably not expressing that well.  Even after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 15 years I haven't found a way to say it that will reach most people. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And most of my time gets eaten doing something far less clueful to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my daily bread.  
</em><br>
<p>Actually, this makes perfect sense. This too is part of The Goal.
