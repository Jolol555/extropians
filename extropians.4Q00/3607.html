<em>&gt; Umm, that's WY_S_IWIG.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ironic that one of your listed &quot;similar&quot; things (all the popular M$
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apps, evidently, lumped together) yield files you *really* don't want to

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd say the closest direct parallel to HTML in the text-processing field
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is probably ROFF/NROFF/TROFF and variants, and you'll notice what a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market share they've garnered today. :)
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The goals of machine readability, etc, etc, of XML are laudable. How
</em><br>
long do
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you reckon they'll last in the face of big commercial interests &amp; a
</em><br>
zillion
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (well, many million) users of various flavours, with their own ideas
</em><br>
about
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how they want to use this thing called the web?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can predict one thing about the future of the Web. It will continue to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suck, but not quite as much as not having it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not real fond of gravy, either (feh!). :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OTOH, nobody (==&quot;not enough bodies&quot;) so far seems to have wanted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; xanalogical storage very badly, and that's pretty much &quot;soup&quot;. People
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have gotten used to herding piles of named files around, even though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's like calling a houseful of mice by name.
