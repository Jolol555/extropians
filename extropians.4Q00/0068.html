<p>Come, let's go hang out with my droogies at the Korova milk bar. We'll

have a nice frontal lobotomy afterwards.

</em><br>
<p>Indeed, if the powerful fraction has advanced sufficiently that they

need to restructure the Earth, would you rather die than be translated
<br>
into characters in an artificial reality environment?
<br>
<p>I don't think the violation is extreme, if continuity is preserved,
<br>
and if people are free to leave the &quot;home sweet home&quot; sandbox any time.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; How is the criminal not a threat to anyone?  What if I don't want to be
</em><br>
<em> &gt; fragged even if the friendly SI will resurrect me instantaneously? 
</em><br>
<p>Huh? You can generate a private artificial reality for every user. If
<br>
someone feels comfortable machine-gunning down random pedestrians, he
<br>
can do that, on dummies, forever. As long as no one gets hurt...
<br>
<p><em> &gt; There is plent of need to discourage criminal abuses regardless of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; whether there is an SI.  Or do you want the human race to go totally
</em><br>
<em> &gt; infantile where nothing is real, nothing is at stake and nothing can
</em><br>
<em> &gt; really be changed at all?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It doesn't require an SI to recognize that our current makeup requires 
<br>
constant challenges (boy, I wish it wasn't so, these 2000 cal gym
<br>
sessions are sure boring).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; I don't propose to &quot;target&quot; anyone.  I simply am floating the idea that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the ultimate in freedom with infinite room to grow is to be able to live
</em><br>
<em> &gt; within whatever world-constraints one most wishes and see how that is.   
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
If I was an SI, I would probably leave everything as is, only make
<br>
death a transition into the next world. (Of course, those who have
<br>
been tortured to death probably *will* complain...)
<br>
<p><em> &gt; What do you think humans will do exactly once your sort of SI is a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; reality?  
</em><br>
<p>Die, of course, as the atoms in their bodies are being
<br>
absorbed. Because only a god can create such a strange thing as a
<br>
SysOp. There is no traversible path from the foothills to Olymp
<br>
mountaintop, at least no one which people and their handiwork can go.
