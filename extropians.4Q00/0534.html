<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;After quietly listening to the exchange on this topic, I submit this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;notion:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that there is some yet unknown mechanical/genetic explanation for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;homosexuality that is a completely random event.  It comes from inheriting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the genital configuration from one parent and the sexual orientation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the other, and that the probability of this is about 5% regardless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of other factors.  I have had gay friends tell me they were gay since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as far back as their earliest memories, cases where twin boys were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;raised identically as far as anyone could tell, yet only one is gay.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must be something genetic, decided at the moment of conception.
</em><br>
<p>Something striking I remember reading is that the correlation between 
<br>
homosexuality between two identical twins is almost exactly 50% (if one twin 
<br>
is gay, his twin has a 50% chance of being gay..) and that for non-identical 
<br>
twins and for just plain brothers, it is about 25%. This tells me that the 
<br>
influence is 50% of genetics and 50% social/environmental/whatever 
<br>
(non-fraternal twins share 50% of their DNA - 50% x 50% = 25%).
<br>
I remember a few years ago, something on the news about a genetic marker for 
<br>
homosexuality being found which had a statistically significant degree of 
<br>
correlation. But then again, it wasn't 100%, and I'm sure social influences 
<br>
or environmental factors play a very large role. I am sure that someone born 
<br>
and raised in San Fransisco has a higher chance of being gay then someone 
<br>
born and raised in Tehran.
<br>
The genetic marker impresses me, but I don't hear much about it. What I do 
<br>
hear about, unfortunately, is that there are differences in the brains of 
<br>
heterosexuals versus homosexuals - certain areas are larger in one group and 
<br>
smaller in the other, with a high degree of correlation. This is cited as 
<br>
strong evidence that homosexuality is caused by biological factors but I 
<br>
think if it's looked at objectively, it's much more likely that the cause is 
<br>
the other way around - it was also recently found that people who went blind 
<br>
and learned braille had their visual cortex shrink and the area dealing with 
<br>
sense of touch on the fingers grow, but nobody suggested that these changes 
<br>
in their brain was what caused them to go blind.
<br>
A properly designed experiment would study these brain areas in deceased 
<br>
infants, or ideally, aborted and miscarried fetuses, classify the 
<br>
appropriate brain areas as larger then or smaller then average, and see if 
<br>
the proportion between large and small matches the proportion between 
<br>
heterosexual and homosexual in the US population.
<br>
I heard something a while ago, which I am skeptical about, which said that 
<br>
if the length of your middle finger is more then one digit longer then your 
<br>
index finger, you're much more likely to be gay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is easy to see how societies with gays would have advantages
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over those that do not, however the above notion would suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that *all* human societies have about the same percent gay, therefor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no group selection advantage there.  spike
</em><br>
<p>(Who just checked the length of their index and middle fingers?)
<br>
The notion that all human societies have about the same percentage of gays 
<br>
is incorrect. There is a tribe - I forget the name, it's a warrior culture, 
<br>
very male dominant tribe, and I don't know where they are (does someone else 
<br>
know?) which practices ritual homosexuality from a very early age, as a rite 
<br>
of puberty. There is a place, some island around Ireland or Scotland, which 
<br>
is known as the most sexually repressed place on Earth (besides Utah), in 
<br>
which such things as homosexuality (and female orgasms) are completely 
<br>
unheard of, and to walk around barefoot is to be considered partially 
<br>
unclothed. I read of both of these places in a text book on &quot;The Sociology 
<br>
of Deviance&quot; by Eriche Goode, it was an illustration of the role that 
<br>
society plays in determining individual sexuality.
