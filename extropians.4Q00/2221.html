<p><em>&gt; The question then turns on this: When is an elector &quot;appointed&quot; for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purposes of Amendment XII?
</em><br>
<p>It's official when the governor of Florida (the brother of one of the candidates by the way)
<br>
issues a &quot;Certificate Of Ascertainment&quot; and sends a copy to the National Archives
<br>
and both houses of congress giving the names of the electors . However a court could
<br>
issue an injunction delaying the governor from doing this. Under federal law If a state is
<br>
unable or unwilling to ascertain their electors 5 weeks after the election the electoral
<br>
collage will go ahead and vote without them.

<p><em>    &gt; Seems like cheating in a way, but Gore did win the popular vote, so he does

<p>Perhaps not. Gore is only ahead by 206,000 votes and there are 1,000,000 absentee
<br>
votes from California, they can't change any race so they're in no hurry to count them.
<br>
In fact they don't plan to do so until January! Absentee votes are usually mostly Republican
<br>
and mostly male, both factors favor Bush, so it's entirely possible he could get 61% of them.
<br>
Anyway, it's going to be fun.
