<p>That's another thing that bothers me about this paper.  Is it really
<br>
showing that the social horizon is longer than the individual horizon?
<br>
It looks to me like the analysis in the paper applies just as well to
<br>
an individual as to a society.  The individual discounts the future, but
<br>
as well intentioned planners we may put a higher weight on future selves
<br>
than he does.  In that case we can say that making the individual adopt
<br>
a longer time horizon will make him happier on average over the course
<br>
of his lifetime.
