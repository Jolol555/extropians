<em>&gt; The predicted instability of the solid version of the dyson sphere has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a source of disappointment for moi ever since I heard about it.  The idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the fully enclosed star was so delightful to me, and so elegant, that I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to rescue me from my despair.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting. That too, was my reaction, many years ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Radiation pressure, baby.  It ain't big, but it's real.
</em><br>
<p>I thought about this long ago, and rejected it. As best I could figure at 
<br>
the time, any minor perturbation of the sphere (such as caused by a major 
<br>
asteroidal collision) would impart more energy than the restorative force 
<br>
of the solar radiation, although I admit that I didn't take the time to 
<br>
work in out on paper. I ended up being more concerned by the total lack of 
<br>
gravity on the inner edge of the sphere, and decided that that too, needed 
<br>
to be solved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Someone may say that radiation forces are puny in the inertial arena.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree, but if they're the only forces in play, then they must dominate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Response times are just very long.
</em><br>
<p>They are only the only forces in play if you have 1) swept the entire 
<br>
solar system clear of debris (I admit that this is likely) and 2) can 
<br>
guarantee that the sun will burn evenly, so that it produces a uniform 
<br>
flux. This last point worries me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Candidate number two is something of a mystery to me. I know it's there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I frankly don't know  how it acts on the system or how it compares in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magnitude of effect to radiation pressure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Magnetic field effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Hmm. I must admit that I never even *considered* magnetic fields.
<br>
<p>What I came up with was to spin the sphere so as to cause pseudo-gravity 
<br>
by centrifical force at the inside equator (and really make it hard to 
<br>
image what substrate would be strong enough to build with). In order to 
<br>
ensure that the inner pseudo-gravity was strictly normal to the surface at 
<br>
all points, carefully sculpted masses would be added to the rotational 
<br>
poles, so that the gravity felt on the inside would be the sum of 
<br>
gravitational and centrifical vectors.
<br>
<p>The upshot of this would be that the dyson sphere would be stable on two 
<br>
axes, but still unstable along its rotational axis. Its not a total 
<br>
solution, but it does make the problem more managable.
<br>
<p>I've never managed to solve the equations that govern the distribution of 
<br>
masses at the poles that is needed to create the correct inner gradients, 
<br>
but I've had a few folks tell me that it looks like the best that can be 
<br>
achieved with finite masses is to have all vectors within some epsilon of 
<br>
being normal to the inner surfaces. Provided epsilon is less than 5 
<br>
degrees or so, I don't think there would be a big problem.
