<em>&gt;NEW ZEALAND: GM multinationals admit that containment is impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;17 Oct 2000
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Author: Clare Harman, just-food.com
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The Royal Commission on Genetic Modification opened yesterday (16 October)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to hear two of the &quot;big six&quot; multinationals established in the field of GM
</em><br>
<em>&gt;products admit that it is impossible to guarantee containment. The two
</em><br>
<em>&gt;companies questioned were cross-examined by the anti-GM groups: Greenpeace,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Green Party, an organic industry group and the Nelson GE-free Awareness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Group.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The 14-week Wellington commission is the first substantial inquiry into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;topic of GM foods in the world, and it is seeking to weigh up the benefits
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the risks of the new crops, dubbed &quot;franken-foods&quot; by anti-GM
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protestors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Aventis, the French pharmaceutical giant and manufacturer of the StarLink
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corn currently causing no end of problems in the US retail sector, stood
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before the hearing first. Product safety manager, Robert MacDonald, conceded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that cross-pollination would occur and agreed that strong regulation &quot;would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be required.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The company recommended a national biotech strategy to &quot;realise the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;potential benefits&quot; of the fledgling technology. Naomi Stevens, the head of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;public affairs, commented that future plants could combat diseases in humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and prove resistant to cold and drought, with the added advantage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;improved nutrition and shelf life. She added, however that she was &quot;not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  sure&quot; that long term clinical testing would provide conclusive evidence on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the allergenic effects of GM foods on human consumers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The US-based DuPont also admitted that there were no guarantees with GM
</em><br>
<em>&gt;products. Clive Holland, representing the company, commented that: &quot;nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in life is risk freeâ€¦ but all our data shows we are comfortably way above
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the line on safety.&quot; To date, he added, no introduced DNA had been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transferred into food products by animals reared on GM feed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;DuPont accepted that public concerns were rife about the technology, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that: &quot;While much of these concerns arise from misinformation or alarmist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exaggeration, we nevertheless believe that we should proceed with caution. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientifically impeccable process is needed and as much information as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible should be made available publicly.&quot; This said, the company stressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that GM crops could increase productivity, provide new products and reduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pesticide use.
