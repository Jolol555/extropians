</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you. However, writing the standard isn't the issue; it's more
<br>
usually gaining the agreements of all major competing players to use it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; technological superiority will sneak in a minimally interoperable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; alternative. The politics is so much easier, and it gives everyone a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you keep the politics out of it. There's not much politics going on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within a single person's head, unless she's got MP syndrome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That's debatable (politics in one person's head), but that's not what I
<br>
meant.
<br>
<p>The politics are in getting various important groups to support your
<br>
standard. Standards don't just get adopted by accident; people choose to
<br>
adopt them. Usually a handful of groups (companies? committees? whatever)
<br>
are crucial to it's success. And often, these groups compete in some way.
<br>
Assuming some groups have a competitive agenda with respect to some
<br>
other(s), each will develop it's own unique position on standards - maybe
<br>
they make their own &quot;standard&quot; (ie: proprietary solution), maybe they adopt
<br>
the standard but subvert it, or maybe they are so weak that they willingly
<br>
sublimate themselves to it, hoping thereby to get a piece of a pie from
<br>
which they would otherwise be denied a slice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; more room to move. For instance, the big orgs will want to subvert the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; standard and own it; a minimal, cruddy standard requires (proprietary)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you make 1.0 fit the bill, get people to use it in an avalanche
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and brand it. Sign the source tarballs and the binaries. Patent it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only allowing noncorporate use. There are probably other mechanisms
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Let's take the case of Gill. He runs a big company; lets call it Sicromoft,
<br>
for hypothetical purposes. I have a large marketshare of related markets,
<br>
and a new tech area pops up in which I am a natural player. Maybe it's VR
<br>
over the internet. We are placed in a future a few years from now, where
<br>
broadband is fairly widely adopted, and people are starting to drop support
<br>
for any connection speeds below say 128kbps.
<br>
<p>Gill's decided it's time to muscle in on this area and own it. He knows that
<br>
a few of the other big boys are thinking the same way. He's missed the boat
<br>
before (although overall he's very good at this game). He's getting in
<br>
relatively early this time around. It's too late to develop his own product
<br>
in this area now (actually, it was tried a few years back, but fell on it's
<br>
bum; he wasn't really serious about it then anyway). So he's going to need
<br>
to coopt someone else's technology, and run with that.
<br>
<p>The state of play... basically at this point, there are a few companies in
<br>
the arena, and a couple of arms of the open source movement. The leading
<br>
&quot;standard&quot; (A) is the free standard. It is by far the technologically
<br>
superior standard, but unfortunately is for non-corporate use only, and is
<br>
guarded by a pack of rabid open-source guard dogs. Some of the proprietary
<br>
solutions have some of the ground (the most successful we'll call B), and
<br>
there is still a really old, crappy &quot;open&quot; standard, a predecessor of the
<br>
current players, which has a little support (C). The people using this
<br>
technology at the moment, regardless of the specific form, are in general
<br>
geekdom and other technologically literate, but the masses are starting to
<br>
sniff around.
<br>
<p>What does Gill do?  Well, he can't touch (A), he's been locked out. Even if
<br>
he could, it probably wouldn't be the right path. No room to move. He'd only
<br>
choose it if he had been beaten to the punch by one or more of the other big
<br>
orgs, which he hasn't been. One of them will probably do it, however, poor
<br>
bastards. Trying to manage a relationship with the free software movement;
<br>
like getting into bed with a porcupine. Urrggh.
<br>
<p>Gill could buy out (B), and push that. As a bonus, it is quite good
<br>
technically. The company that owns it is worth one day's lunch money to
<br>
Gill; price is not an issue. This might be a goer, but he has the problems
<br>
of selling a closed solution. A good fix would be to release it as an open
<br>
standard, minus a few important details, then bombard the market with his
<br>
proprietary, almost standard  implementations. He controls the playing
<br>
field, he decides on what is in the standard and what is not, he can stay
<br>
ahead of the pack. That's worked quite well for him before!
<br>
<p>Another choice would be to grab the obselete open standard, (C), and become
<br>
it's champion. Of course, it's got problems, and would require some
<br>
proprietary extensions. It would be a legitimate looking way of fighting off
<br>
(A), however, which is currently his biggest threat. Then he can pillory (B)
<br>
and all it's cohort for being evil closed standards, and (A) he can rubbish
<br>
as being a geeks' toy, with no moral weight greater than (C), and with no
<br>
industry support. If they maintain their no-corporations approach, this will
<br>
be ridiculously easy; he can probably get some of the other big guys behind
<br>
(C), on the understanding that this is to kill (A), and that everyone will
<br>
fork off their own &quot;standards&quot; in the near future, and fight over the ground
<br>
left by (A)'s demise. If (A), on the other hand, decides to allow corporate
<br>
involvement, then a company coopting them might be a threat, if it isn't cut
<br>
to pieces trying to work with free software people.
<br>
<p>Whatever the choice, there'll be a massive fud campaign against A. He can
<br>
probably get a lot of industry support for the fud; maybe together they can
<br>
form an independent special interest &quot;user group&quot; or some such to do the
<br>
job. Also, Gill will probably play one of his trump cards; provide optional
<br>
&quot;support&quot; for A in his products, which is mostly broken, and performs
<br>
abysmally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; extensions to be workable. A solid, locked in, proper standard just
</em><br>
makes
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them look like bastards for stuffing around with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Good standards for interoperability only seem to be useful to the weaker
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; players. I think that's why they fail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the weaker players would dominate the place if they'd realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much power concerted action wields. The problem is they're not only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weak,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're stupid (uncaring).
</em><br>
<p>Not stupid; self interested. In the classic sense, that often looks a lot
<br>
like stupidity; working out how to group together to maximise each
<br>
individual's self interest seems to be a weakness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Masses produce nothing, it's the individuals.
</em><br>
<p>Yep. A few rich ones, with a bit of drive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Has everybody smart sold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>By definition?
