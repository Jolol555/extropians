<p><em>    &gt; A thermostat is set to switch on or off at a given (preset)
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; temperature. It cannot decide to override this setting, so
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; does not make this &quot;decision&quot; internally.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;A thermostats makes its decision
</em><br>
<p>... excuse me, but thermostats are just switches that kick
<br>
in at a given threshold, the whole point is that it can't &quot;make
<br>
its decision&quot; ....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;based on its internal state and
</em><br>
<p>A digital switch does not have an &quot;internal state&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;the external state of the environment, people do the same thing, both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot; readjust their logic in response to the environment&quot; as you say.
</em><br>
<p>No, people are not preset &quot; say to put on a hat if temperature drops below
<br>
zero degrees or whatever. We can readjust our logic, switches cannot.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Turing machines are neither conscious,
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;How do you know?
</em><br>
<p>Well, they would fail the Turing test for starters.
<br>
The lack of some form of ultimate proof (my appeal is to
<br>
intuition and common sense ultimately) is not a problem
<br>
however. *NO* empirical theory can be ultimately proven.
<br>
The lack of absolute certainty should not blind us to the
<br>
obvious though ... we have to go with best evidence.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Digital computers tends to be finite-state, whereas analog(ous
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; to infinite-state) evolvable hardware is more like our brains.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Welcome to the exciting world of analog computing. Thanks to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;new Heath Kit Home Study Course, you can build your very own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;analog computer in the  privacy of your own home. Make big bucks!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Amaze your friends! Be a hit at  parties! This is a true analog computer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no wimpy pseudo analog stuff here, this baby can handle infinity.
</em><br>
<p>You have rather foolishly missed the whole point that ANALOG is the
<br>
abbreviation of &quot;analogous to infinite-state&quot; ... since true infinity
<br>
is a conjecture ......
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Turing machines are hard-wired and cannot evince PHASIC
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;TRANSIENT behaviour  ... correct me if I am wrong?
</em><br>
<p>Ok, you are wrong. A Turing machine is not hard wired, its program
<br>
can put it into any internal configuration, and the only behavior
<br>
a Turing machine can't produce is pure randomness, that is, produce
<br>
an effect without a cause.
<br>
<p>Are you actually claiming the Turing machines exhibit phasic
<br>
transients? Cite evidence please, you are utterly lost on this.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Sense-data (experience) and the conscious sensor/ self
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;seem to be different types
</em><br>
<p>How so?
<br>
<p>They *seem* so because we can make this distinction in speech,
<br>
and a difference is that sense-dat come from external objects,
<br>
whereas the phantom median eye is internally generated.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;MVT explains the virtual sensor(gan), the phantom median  eye
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Seems to me all you've done is conjure up a black box, call it the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phantom median eye and say consciousness comes from there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not very helpful.
</em><br>
<p>No, the conceptual &quot;black box&quot; which was a problem before MVT
<br>
now has a complete description, in actual terms and as an evolutionary
<br>
narrative, as the phantom media eye. I have done away with mere
<br>
&quot;black box&quot; conjecture!
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;I don't want to get bogged down in individual cases because of the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;problem  of solipsism.
</em><br>
<p>You're going to have to get bogged down in it because if you have a complete
<br>
theory of consciousness you should be able to prove that solipsism is untrue
<br>
but you can't and I don't believe such a theory is even possible.
<br>
<p>Solipsism is simply one (admissible) viewpoint. It isn't &quot;refutable&quot; since
<br>
I do not deny that people have this thought. Infinite-state capability
<br>
allows
<br>
*any possible thoughts* including the solipsistic ones. Likewise you cannot
<br>
prove it &quot;correct.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Please
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand, I'm not a solipsist but when somebody claims to have solved the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most profound problem in philosophy it's my duty to pretend that I am and
</em><br>
see
<br>
<em>&gt;if they can prove me wrong.
</em><br>
<p>But the mind-body problem (solved by MVT) is a different &quot;problem&quot; to
<br>
solipsism. And I claim that MVT throws light on (purely linguistic) problems
<br>
such as the various paradoxes including solipsism (in practice you cannot
<br>
be a solipsist and meaningfully engage with others and operate in the
<br>
world).
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Do you accept that dreams happen?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I accept that my dreams happen, I don't know about you.
</em><br>
<p>Then (whether you believe that I exist independently, or am just another
<br>
facet of *your* consciousness - the solipsistic claim) by accepting that
<br>
at least your dreams exist, you allow a conscious phenomenon, and defeat
<br>
your
<br>
previous claim that consciousness doesn't occur.
<br>
<p>Do you still deny &quot;consciousness&quot;? I argue the idealist stance that in
<br>
fact the world can be said to exist in consciousness, and not that
<br>
consciousness (phantom pineal eye) is located in space.
