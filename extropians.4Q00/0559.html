Curt, you may have explained one observation I made a few years ago. One gym
<br>
I went to had the cardio machines facing the aerobics room which had a glass
<br>
wall so you could see the aerobics classes.
<br>
<p>The women were checking out the gay guys, the gay guys were checking out the
<br>
straight guys, the straight guys were checking out the women. Fun to watch.
<br>
<p>Best Ralph

<em>&gt;&gt; Beginning of a better theory: I've read that women who identify themselves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;as lesbians (not bisexual, but lesbians) have actually had more sex with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;more men then women who identify themselves as heterosexual. This is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;paradoxical, I don't know why it would be like this.  I have not read the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;equivalent stat for gay males, but I think it wouldn't surprise me to learn 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that men who consider themselves gay have had sex with more women then have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;men who consider themselves straight, but (obviously) the number of sexual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;encounters with the opposite sex would be much less. So if this were true, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the evolutionary benefit is easier to figure out, but why would it be like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;this? Can anyone think of reasons why a homosexual would actually lead to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;more heterosexual partners then a heterosexual? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I posted a hypothesis here relating to this some years ago.  Basically, humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are unusual in that a great deal of our sexual selection cues are learned.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do like other people with bumps in the right places, but we are also attracted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to good singing, witty conversation, stylish clothes, fascinating music 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collections,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;etc.  So it would benefit us to pay more attention to the sexually attractive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of our own sex, to learn how to attract the opposite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One obvious way for genes to induce us to pay more attention to attractive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;members of our sex is to turn on the attraction mechanisms normally on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the other sex.  Normal humans carry all the genes for both sexes, except
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for one maleness switch gene absent in women because it's on the Y 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chromosome.  The genes that produce the physical and psychological charac-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;teristics of the other sex are just off, or at least less active.  It would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be an evolutionarily easy process for some of the off switches relating to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sexual attraction drives to get leaky.  Some sexual activity with the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sex is no problem at all for the genes, as long as on average they produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more reproductive sexual activity, or activity with more desirable people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By my hypothesis, the &quot;optimal&quot; phenotype would presumably be bisexual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Purely straight people would be, on average, less able to make themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;desirable; purely gay people would not bother to take advantage of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;desirability to the opposite sex.  I think it's unlikely that purely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;homosexual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;orientation is genetically advantageous because otherwise it'd be more common.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I can also hypothesize a gene-meme coevolutionary reason for why most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cultures disapprove of homosexuality.  A meme inducing its carriers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;refrain from sexual activity with the same sex would presumably produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more desire for activity with the opposite sex.  If the carriers still *want*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it with the same sex, then they'll still pay attention, and still derive the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;desirability advantages.  The carriers may be miserable, but that's not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meme's or the gene's problem.  If the meme is often transmitted vertically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(which includes most religions) then it derives a transmission benefit and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tends to spread.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Just as a meme suppressed same-sex activity without suppressing same-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sex desire can be selectively favored, a gene with similar effects could too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The homophobic indeed tend to be aroused by same-sex erotica more than the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;population in general.  I think there's a strong genetic component to homo-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phobia just as there is to homosexuality.
