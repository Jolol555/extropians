Anybody who gives their nephews cash is a cool uncle (or grandfathers),
<br>
though eli is being a bit stingy. Then again, that kid was not his
<br>
relative either. Now, a real uncle or grandfather would pull silver
<br>
dollars out of your ear at odd moments...

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You know, I've been here for several years, and I must say, this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; right up there as one of the strangest exchanges I've ever seen on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; this list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Why, thank you!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Perhaps this will all become clearer if I relate a story:  I was recently,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a few weeks back, waiting at an airport.  Next to me was a family, also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;waiting - a mother, a very young boy (4 or 5), and a slightly older girl.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The boy had five pennies.  He would lay them out on the table next to me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in patterns - the one I saw was a star, a penny at the center and four
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;other pennies in a square around it - and then pick up the pennies again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and count them.  &quot;One, two, three, four, five.  I have five pennies.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What would *you* have done?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I, of course, took out my wallet, as unobtrusively as possible, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;extracted all the pennies - I had five.  I didn't have to do this part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;completely invisibly, since there was no logical reason for the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;next to me to notice - there was no way they could know that I was taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;out pennies - but I did want to make sure there was nothing memorable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;about the action.  Anyway, the next time the kid's back was turned - and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;his mother and sister were looking away, of course - I carefully and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;quietly put a penny on the table.  He noticed it, picked it up, added it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to his collection, and then counted.  &quot;One, two, three, four, five, six.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I have six pennies.&quot;  Then he started to lay them out again.  Again, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;waited for my moment, then added another two pennies.  &quot;One, two, three,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;four, five, six, seven, eight.  I have eight pennies.&quot;  He turned away and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;started tugging on Mommy's sleeve.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Boy:  &quot;Mommy, I have eight pennies.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Mommy (clearly not paying any attention):  &quot;That's nice, dear.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Eliezer (while boy's back is turned):  Adds another penny.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;His sister actually caught me at this point, but I managed to put a finger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to my lips - the silent &quot;Shhh!&quot; gesture - before she started laughing.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;she just watched, though with a big smile on her face.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Boy (counts again):  &quot;Mommy, I have nine pennies.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Mommy:  &quot;Uh huh.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;At this point I tried to add a tenth penny, but the boy turned around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;before I was ready and caught me - he said &quot;Hey!&quot; - and we all started
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;laughing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What are *you* complaining about?  He got to keep the pennies.  My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;original plan, if I hadn't been caught, was to go up to ten pennies and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;then start stealing them until he was back down to five.  That would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;enlivened not just one day but the rest of his life.
