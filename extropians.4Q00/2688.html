<p>This would not match my own suspicion.

<p>Well, I simply don't know of scientific studies of the moment of
<br>
intoxication, but about the long-term effects I do know that THC and
<br>
cannabis have far less chance of ruining the life of the user through
<br>
their physiological effects than alcohol.  Indeed alcohol has a known
<br>
deleterious effect on the brain and marijuana has no similar proven
<br>
effects.  Moreover, the consumption of marijuana in a society
<br>
enforcing a prohibition on it is a qualitatively different action from
<br>
consuming alcohol.

<p><em>&gt; SDI bought us little, but it helped collapse the Soviet economy. If one

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This assumes that it was the job or the duty of the U.S. to cause the
<br>
collapse of the Soviet system.  Though I agree that the result was
<br>
beneficial, I question the obligation of U.S. citizens to pay whatever
<br>
cost was required to get that result.  I'll still be paying down that
<br>
debt with my income taxes for years.
<br>
<p>As to the other experimental benefits, if we were interested in
<br>
producing good science why not directly subsidize it?
<br>
<p>I think the government owes it to its citizens to restrict its defense
<br>
expenditures to defense, and leave behind the imperial pretensions.
