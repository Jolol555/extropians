<em>&gt; As a recently engaged extropian, I feel I can offer some insight into this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One will always find the best relationships with their intellectual peers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Due to the lingering effects of our patriarchy, today's women are still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mostly airheads.  I have long since discovered that true love with such an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airhead is impossible.
</em><br>
<p>Due to the lingering effects of the patriarchy most guys are arrogant
<br>
selfish twits who shouldn't be allowed out in polite society. :-) Many
<br>
of them have ingrained &quot;me man, you my woman&quot; BS at some level that
<br>
precludes real equality in a male-female relationship.  Many men are
<br>
still scared shitless of a woman as smart/capable (or heaven forbid)
<br>
smarter than themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, there are a good number of intellectually gifted women nowadays,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're just hard to find.  And for them, it is likewise hard to find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectually compatible men, for most men are airheads, too, despite their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then there's the geek factor.  Let's face it.  Most people that have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains to be extropian are lacking in looks, social skills, or both.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takes a lot of deprogramming for those who are both intelligent AND good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking to realize that the intelligence is the most important factor and go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the nerd instead of the babe or jock.
</em><br>
<p><p>Just a tad stereotypical here.  Women have for quite a while not
<br>
emphasized the actual looks of the men they were interested in.  At
<br>
least not the way guys are trained to see a woman's looks as a plus or
<br>
minus in their own status system.  Women tend to be more interested
<br>
classically in whether the guy is a decent provider (not so relevant
<br>
today but still relevant) and whether he is reasonably stable and not
<br>
likely to be abusive and of course in what kind of companion he is on
<br>
multiple levels.  Bright women want to know they have a lover/mate that
<br>
understands what moves them and will actually be a help rather than the
<br>
kind of hindrance that feels their careers detract from the guy's
<br>
&quot;legitimate needs&quot; or something.  Women (and men) also want a partner
<br>
who they respect and admire.
<br>
<p>It is mainly the guys that need to get past &quot;lookist&quot; bs.  
<br>
<p>Now some of this and women's equivalent hankering for the &quot;hunk&quot; is
<br>
biological wiring looking for likely good reproductive candidates.  That
<br>
of course is becoming far less relevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is also the fact that high intelligence (and the money that it often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brings) gives you the ability to seduce the more beautiful members of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite sex that would be otherwise inaccessible to you.  Many social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians will choose this path and never discover the joys of dating an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual equal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Really?  That would be pretty dumb.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then there's the typically extropian tendency to sit on the computer all day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing code or posting to the usenet.  This rarely leads to marriage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plus, there is the implication of monogamy that exists in traditional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marriage that anyone with half a brain realizes is a pile of dog-doo (or at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least acts accordingly).  Marriage is often shunned by extropians seeking to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abandon the chains of the past and build an exciting new high-tech future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many long-term couplings amongst extropians might not take on the form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marriage as a result.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  A good solid life-partner (at least for the foreseeable X
<br>
years) is a real asset.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All in all, there is a very low probability of any two extropians of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite sexes meeting each other, much less falling in love and choosing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commit to marrige.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, I wouldn't limit it to just extropians of the opposite sex
<br>
myself.  Many computer geek folks and extropians are bisexual or
<br>
gay/lesbian. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; However, none of this is grounds to abandon the idea of a life-long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; committed relationship with a member of the same or opposite sex.  Nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said you have to conform to all the rules implied by marriage in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture, and one's brain is greatly enhanced by the physical and mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stimulation of a steady partner.  So here's what we've done.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lauren and I decided to get married while having breakfast at Shoney's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following an all-nighter working on our Internet business (I found that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite romantic, in an extropian sort of way).  Since we already live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together, have a joint checking account, and are partners in a business, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have viewed marriage as a formality.  And our decision to get married was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision to go through the legal formality of marriage in order to derive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the benefits our legal system and culture give to married couples.
</em><br>
<p>Cool.  But a bit too dry for me.  A little bit more romance doesn't hurt
<br>
at all. What you are describing sounds more like a marriage of
<br>
convenience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We're going to sign the papers at the courthouse and take care of the legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formality now.  When we've got enough money to throw a decent party, we'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take care of the ceremonial aspect of marriage--which can be cool if done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We practice an open relationship, which gives us the freedom to creatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explore our sexuality and love with other people without divorce, jealousy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regret or any other negatives (except herpes which a good extropian would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cure).  I think that open relationships would save most marriages, or at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least make them more fun.  Most extropians don't get married due to aversion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to monogamy, gayness or social withdrawal.  Open relationships make marriage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compatible with all but the latter.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm.  So how does a &quot;good extropian&quot; cure herpes anyhow?  
<br>
<p>Gays and lesbians should be able to marry also of course.  And marry
<br>
their actual partners rather than create the same legal fiction so many
<br>
of us have since the beginning of human history.  
<br>
<p>I am of mixed mind about open relationships.  They are quite natural and
<br>
beautiful for me in many respects.  But I have had too many partners I
<br>
loved a great deal who couldn't get the hang of it.  Also, I think there
<br>
is something to be said for a long-term one person only sexual/romantic
<br>
relationship.  So I guess my position is that I understand and
<br>
appreciate both open and monogamous relationships that are healthy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good luck to you all in finding true extropic love--it's very much worth it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Good Luck to you and yours Aaron.
