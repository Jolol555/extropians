<p>In Defense of the Electoral College
<br>
<p>by John Samples
<br>
<p>John Samples is director of the Center for Representative Government 
<br>
at the Cato Institute.
<br>
<p>Critics have long derided the Electoral College as a fusty relic of a 
<br>
bygone era, an unnecessary institution that one day might undermine 
<br>
democracy by electing a minority president. That day has arrived, 
<br>
assuming Gov. Bush wins the Florida recount as seems likely.
<br>
<p>The fact that Bush is poised to become president without a plurality 
<br>
of the vote contravenes neither the letter nor the spirit of the 
<br>
Constitution. The wording of our basic law is clear: The winner in 
<br>
the Electoral College takes office as president. But what of the 
<br>
spirit of our institutions? Are we not a democracy that honors the 
<br>
will of the people? The very question indicates a misunderstanding of 
<br>
our Constitution.
<br>
<p>James Madison's famous Federalist No. 10 makes clear that the 
<br>
Founders fashioned a republic, not a pure democracy. To be sure, they 
<br>
knew that the consent of the governed was the ultimate basis of 
<br>
government, but the Founders denied that such consent could be 
<br>
reduced to simple majority or plurality rule. In fact, nothing could 
<br>
be more alien to the spirit of American constitutionalism than 
<br>
equating democracy will the direct, unrefined will of the people.
<br>
<p>Recall the ways our constitution puts limits on any unchecked power, 
<br>
including the arbitrary will of the people. Power at the national 
<br>
level is divided among the three branches, each reflecting a 
<br>
different constituency. Power is divided yet again between the 
<br>
national government and the states. Madison noted that these twofold 
<br>
divisions -- the separation of powers and federalism -- provided a 
<br>
&quot;double security&quot; for the rights of the people.
<br>
<p>What about the democratic principle of one person, one vote? Isn't 
<br>
that principle essential to our form of government? The Founders' 
<br>
handiwork says otherwise. Neither the Senate, nor the Supreme Court, 
<br>
nor the president is elected on the basis of one person, one vote. 
<br>
That's why a state like Montana, with 883,000 residents, gets the 
<br>
same number of Senators as California, with 33 million people. 
<br>
Consistency would require that if we abolish the Electoral College, 
<br>
we rid ourselves of the Senate as well. Are we ready to do that?
<br>
<p>The filtering of the popular will through the Electoral College is an 
<br>
affirmation, rather than a betrayal, of the American republic. Doing 
<br>
away with the Electoral College would breach our fidelity to the 
<br>
spirit of the Constitution, a document expressly written to thwart 
<br>
the excesses of majoritarianism. Nonetheless, such fidelity will 
<br>
strike some as blind adherence to the past. For those skeptics, I 
<br>
would point out two other advantages the Electoral College offers.
<br>
<p>First, we must keep in mind the likely effects of direct popular 
<br>
election of the president. We would probably see elections dominated 
<br>
by the most populous regions of the country or by several large 
<br>
metropolitan areas. In the 2000 election, for example, Vice President 
<br>
Gore could have put together a plurality or majority in the 
<br>
Northeast, parts of the Midwest, and California.
<br>
<p>The victims in such elections would be those regions too sparsely 
<br>
populated to merit the attention of presidential candidates. Pure 
<br>
democrats would hardly regret that diminished status, but I wonder if 
<br>
a large and diverse nation should write off whole parts of its 
<br>
territory. We should keep in mind the regional conflicts that have 
<br>
plagued large and diverse nations like India, China, and Russia. The 
<br>
Electoral College is a good antidote to the poison of regionalism 
<br>
because it forces presidential candidates to seek support throughout 
<br>
the nation. By making sure no state will be left behind, it provides 
<br>
a measure of coherence to our nation.
<br>
<p>Second, the Electoral College makes sure that the states count in 
<br>
presidential elections. As such, it is an important part of our 
<br>
federalist system -- a system worth preserving. Historically, 
<br>
federalism is central to our grand constitutional effort to restrain 
<br>
power, but even in our own time we have found that devolving power to 
<br>
the states leads to important policy innovations (welfare reform).
<br>
<p>If the Founders had wished to create a pure democracy, they would 
<br>
have done so. Those who now wish to do away with the Electoral 
<br>
College are welcome to amend the Constitution, but if they succeed, 
<br>
they will be taking America further away from its roots as a 
<br>
constitutional republic.
