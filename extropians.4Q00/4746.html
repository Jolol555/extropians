CYMM ASKS:
<br>
<em>&gt; But Robert, fruit flies are relativerly shortlived, postmitotic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critters that don't run into the problems that longlived creatures with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more or less permanent mitotic tissues face. 
</em><br>
<p>True, I've not noticed anyone claiming that flies dye from cancer.
<br>
Such are the risks of self-renewal that solving one problem creates
<br>
another.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What'll happen to the material that's shunted away from Kreb's Cycle...??? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what sort of degradation will it undergo... and are organisms like us 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prepared to deal with such??? would we see an increase in browning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reactions etc.... ??? Which won't be debilitating in a fruitfly...because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of timescales...but will in us. 
</em><br>
<p>The most recent information I've seen is that they don't currently
<br>
know what molecule the gene transports (they are working on figuring
<br>
that out).  My suspicion is that it may be something that feeds
<br>
into the mitochondrial respiratory chain in such a way that
<br>
it results in a greater production of free radicals.  So by blocking
<br>
cellular absorption of that nutrient, you may (a) be forcing the
<br>
cells to burn only the &quot;cleanest&quot; fuel available; or (b) be forcing
<br>
the cells to run &quot;leaner&quot;, producing less overall pollution (free
<br>
radicals).  Whatever the molecule is that isn't getting used is,
<br>
it probably gets recycled through a less damaging pathway or simply is
<br>
excreted.  Or the molecule may end up being used, just at a slower
<br>
rate -- the scientists said the activity of the gene was only
<br>
&quot;partially&quot; blocked, and that it appeared that knocking the gene
<br>
out entirely would shorten lifespan (perhaps because the flies
<br>
are really starving).
<br>
<p>If the cells are running lean, they may have a lower circulating
<br>
glucose level, therefore there would be a decrease in browning
<br>
(protein glycation) reactions.  I don't know enough about fly
<br>
physiology to know the degree to which various organs do what
<br>
ours do (i.e. our liver breaking down glycogen to produce
<br>
circulating sugar for muscle or brain activity).  We not only
<br>
need to know what molecule(s) the gene transports but also
<br>
the tissues in which it is active.  As I think I mentioned
<br>
previously, using this approach in humans may be difficult
<br>
if we produce a drug that blocks the activity of that gene
<br>
in humans but that turns out to make you feel hungry all the
<br>
time (as people on CR generally do).
