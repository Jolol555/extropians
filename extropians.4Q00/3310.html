<em>&gt; &gt; 1) Flash or print a concealed weapon in New Mexico, one of those rural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; places you and I both tend to like. Get arrested. Resist arrest and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; escape, claiming that your constitutional rights are being violated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Return to your home. Wait for the SWAT team and negotiators. I am not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; saying it's right, I am saying it happens; at some point, if you act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;weird&quot; enough, you will be presumed to be a danger to others and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will be called a wacko. Even in Ojai.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Resisting arrest and escape are dumb ideas in any event, and will get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you negative attention no matter where you go. Best to just sit it out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and kick their asses in the courtroom.
</em><br>
<p>No, best not to arouse attention: concealed carry of a handgun is flat
<br>
out illegal in NM, regardless of whether it should be or not. I am not
<br>
picking on NM, I just selected it because on the face of it, it seems
<br>
like a pretty free-living place. 
<br>
<p>Let's not drag out the FIJA/appeal-this-all-the-way-to-the-SCotUS
<br>
setpiece. OK? 
<br>
<p>To sum up: I am talking about some people wondering if one might be
<br>
tetched in the head. I am saying that just being oneself can sometimes
<br>
get people to wondering. You really want to say that isn't so? Fine. We
<br>
should then agree to disagree.
<br>
<p>Move along, nothing to see here...
