<p><p>My dear Spike, you are the third person who has asked me that question
<br>
in the last several months (the other two being Eric Drexler and
<br>
Robert Bradbury). You all have the same goal in mind, I know. Your
<br>
approach makes perfect sense to me ...  but ..
<br>
<p>I think you either need to talk to an interstellar medium specialist
<br>
to get an up-to-date and complete answer, or else wait until my thesis
<br>
is finished. What I know is pretty basic stuff. I've written it on the
<br>
list before, so this will be a repeat.
<br>
<p>I understand that if we compare the density of interstellar dust
<br>
grains with the density of the interstellar gas, the dust-to-gas
<br>
ratio is typically 10^{-2}, which means that a large fraction of
<br>
heavy elements must be tied up in dust grains. Most astrophysical
<br>
objects such as the Sun, HII regions, etc. seem to have a fairly
<br>
standard chemical composition consisting of 73% hydrogen, 25% helium
<br>
and 2 per cent of heavier elements by mass. So therefore, the
<br>
gas-to-dust (or better the dust-to-gas) ratio can be related
<br>
directly to the metallicity and to the history of the interstellar
<br>
medium. I don't know very much about how this works though, but G. 
<br>
Helou at Caltech has written some things about that in the context
<br>
of galactic and extragalctic dust. And I don't know more precisely
<br>
the numbers for elemental abundances than what I wrote above. 
<br>
<p>Maybe this paper can say more (I have not read it):
<br>
<p>astro-ph/0007314 :
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title: Chemical Abundances in our Galaxy and Other Galaxies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derived from H II Regions Authors: M. Peimbert, L. Carigi,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Peimbert Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures. The evolution of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galaxies. I- Observational Clues. Conference Proceedings
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We discuss the accuracy of the abundance determinations of H
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II regions in our Galaxy and other galaxies. We focus on the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;main observational constraints derived from abundance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determinations that have implications for models of galactic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chemical evolution: a) the helium to hydrogen abundance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ratio, He/H; b) the oxygen to hydrogen abundance ratio, O/H;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) the carbon to oxygen abundance ratio, C/O; d) the helium
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to oxygen and helium to heavy elements abundance ratios,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delta Y/ Delta O and Delta Y/ Delta Z; and e) the primordial
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;helium abundance, Yp. (43kb)
<br>
<p>If you spend some time on ADS or the astro-ph using keywords like
<br>
&quot;heavy element abundances insterstellar medium&quot;, that would be one
<br>
good beginning to get more papers like the above. (that's what I would
<br>
do to get up to speed on the abundances).
<br>
<p>Please note that that there are different dusty regions of space with
<br>
different densities and different heavy elemental abundances.
<br>
<p>1) stardust
<br>
2) dust in the clouds of the diffuse interstellar medium
<br>
3) dust in molecular clouds
<br>
4) circumstellar dust (young stellar objects or in planetary systems)
<br>
<p>I don't know the number densities for all of these, but here are a
<br>
couple of rough numbers.
<br>
<p>In the diffuse interstellar medium (not in dark clouds) there are
<br>
about 10^{-12}- 10^{-13} grains/cm^3 but near a dusty star there will
<br>
be far more grains per cm^3. I'm not sure of &quot;how much more&quot; but the
<br>
papers on circumstellar dust stars like beta Pic should have this
<br>
number. Also, when I calculate the mass of the moon converted into 100
<br>
micron radius dust particles of density 3 gr/cm^3 in a spherical
<br>
volume of 1AU, I get a number density of 10{-10} cm^3, so that should
<br>
be in the ballpark of what you will find in the beta Pic papers. (In
<br>
magnetospheres of giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, the number
<br>
density of dust is even greater, especially if you have dust sources
<br>
like moons, rings, etc.)
<br>
<p>I told both Eric and Robert and this list also about this next paper:
<br>
<p>&quot;Dust in the local interstellar wind&quot; (1999)
<br>
P. C. Frisch, J. Dorschner, J. Geiss, J. M. Greenberg,
<br>
E. Gruen, M. Landgraf, P. Hoppe, A. P. Jones, W. Kraetschmer,
<br>
T. J. Linde, G. E. Morfill, W. T. Reach, J. Slavin, J. Svestka,
<br>
A. Witt, and G. P. Zank. Astrophysical Journal, 525 , 492-516
<br>
<p>Frisch et al's paper does and concludes:
<br>
<p>* Elemental abundances and the dust-to-gas ratio are calculated towards
<br>
two directions (&quot;column densities&quot;) in our local interstellar
<br>
environment: towards eps CMa and alpha Sco.
<br>
<p>* There is not enough mass &quot;missing&quot; from the gas phase to form the dust
<br>
grain population observed by the spacecraft.
<br>
<p>* Dust grains are overabundant in the cloud feeding interstellar
<br>
grains into the solar system.
<br>
<p>* The cloud around the solar system is a weakly depleted cloud with
<br>
respect to the refractory elements.
<br>
<p>* There is evidence for interstellar shock fronts destroying grains in
<br>
the local interstellar cloud (LIC).
<br>
<p>* The eps CMA LIC component has no carbon available for the dust, a
<br>
manifestation of the &quot;carbon crisis&quot; written in Dwek (1997). The lack
<br>
of carbon avail for the interstellar dust grains and the presence of
<br>
SiC presolar grains in meteorites may indicate an additional
<br>
carbon-rich grain source beyond gas condensation from circumstellar
<br>
dust grains.

<p>Oh, yes, Alyssa Goodman has an excellent article in Sky&amp;Telescope
<br>
called &quot;Recycling in the Galaxy&quot; (I think that's the title) published
<br>
a few months ago. My copy is not at hand, but perhaps she has some
<br>
things to say regarding this topic too. Her Web site is
<br>
<a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~agoodman/">http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~agoodman/</a> (I think), and so you might find
<br>
some papers on this topic there.
