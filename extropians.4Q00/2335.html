One reform I hope to see come out of this situation is some kind of standard
<br>
balloting system. Computers could be used to make most of these
<br>
irregularities impossible. They could make it impossible to submit an
<br>
illegal ballot. They could display the names of candidates the voter has
<br>
tentatively chosen for his confirmation. They could warn him if he has left
<br>
any office unvoted. To maintain a paper trail as a safeguard, for each
<br>
office voted a ballot slip could be printed: 10 offices, 10 slips. That
<br>
would allow the machine to pre-sort them by the voter's choices. If, to
<br>
reasonable tolerances, they had a standard weight, the machine count could
<br>
be verified by weighing each stack of ballot slips. The voter could be given
<br>
the chance to review the ballot slips for errors. He could abort and start
<br>
over, or confirm and allow the ballot slips to fall on the stacks. The
<br>
tallies could be kept essentially in real time as the voting progressed, and
<br>
the winner of a state would be known with certainty when the poll closed.
<br>
This seems like a reasonable standard to me.
<br>
<p>As far as other voting systems I think you want to keep things as simple as
<br>
possible. That seems to be a weakness of the Borda system if there are many
<br>
choices. How about just giving the voter a chance to make a second choice?.
<br>
As a first stage elimination determine the two highest vote-getters from
<br>
first choices. If the voter's first choice is not among the two highest, but
<br>
his second choice is, then count his second choice in a second-stage
<br>
supplemental count. Of course this could be generalized from 2 choices and 2
<br>
counts to n choices and n counts if you wanted. Having two choices would
<br>
make it more appealing to vote for an 'unelectable candidate'. The second
<br>
choice could be kept for the mainstream candidate you least dislike. This
<br>
system would make it much easier for a &quot;fringe&quot; party to gain substantial
<br>
support. And for precisely that reason, I don't think there is a snowball's
<br>
chance in hell that the Dems and Reps would allow it to come into existence.
<br>
But it's interesting to think about.
