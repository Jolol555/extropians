<em>&gt; You guys were soooooooo lucky: I always was interested in computers, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my Dad wouldn't even let me touch his computer. My Mom finally could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afford a computer for me when I was 17, it was a Commodore Amiga 500. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1995, I finally got a Pentium-I-60Mhz box, and I was almost 25 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old. Living in Germany, my Mom and I couldn't afford internet access
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until the end of 1998.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, I want to take this opportunity to thank my husband Brian Atkins for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uplifting me into a world I dreamed of for such a long time: A private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; network, consisting of 9 computers. He helped me building an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AMD-Athlon-700Mhz box, I got an Apple G4 cube (just for the looks of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course :-) and an OpenBSD server.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I didn't see a computer until at 16 I and a bunch of other area math
<br>
nerds were invited to a free introductory course on programming they
<br>
new-fangled things.  It was awful!  Key-punching decks in Cobol.  Why
<br>
they would teach such an idiotic excuse for a language to math people I
<br>
will never know.  Sadistic.  The computer was some huge IBM iron in the
<br>
basement of this huge complex.  When you opened the door all paper not
<br>
weighted down would fly everywhere from all the roaring wind.  They poor
<br>
elaphantine mass was an electronic simpleton.  The compiler was a bad
<br>
joke.  I was so disgusted I didn't go near the things again until some
<br>
years later when the first microchips were available to roll your own
<br>
with, which I proceeded to do.

<em>&gt; &gt; Well, as long as we are reminiscing about computers, my first experience in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computing was with the lovely Apple IIc, programming BASIC and LOGO right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from the command prompt. I guess that was about 1980, I was in 2nd grade
</em><br>
<p><p>Aging myself still further, after I got back into computers through
<br>
early chips I was hanging with a bunch of techno-hippies in the
<br>
Haight-Ashbury.  Half of these people were on SSI, brighter than any 10
<br>
people but non-functional in the everyday world.  I was at a friend's 
<br>
build-your-own microcomputer class one evening.  At this class you had
<br>
to learn to concentrate despite all the pot being passed around.  What
<br>
can I say?  It was a different era.  There was a knock at the door.  He
<br>
opened the door and these two long hairs were there holding a wooden
<br>
box.  He introduced them as Steve and Steve and said they had built a
<br>
new computer and were putting together a company around it.  It was the
<br>
Apple prototype.  We sat around and argued about their CPU choice and
<br>
such.  No one there had the slightest idea how much money was riding on
<br>
that little box. 
<br>
<p>Foolishly I stopped hanging around that group mostly not too long after
<br>
that  because I couldn't tell the geniuses from the crazies any more. 
<br>
If there was any difference.  Instead I headed off to college to study
<br>
math and computers in what I thought was a more profitable and thorough
<br>
way.  Silly me.
