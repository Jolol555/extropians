<p>Thanks for reminding me about this book.  I just tried to locate it in my
<br>
bookcase, but I think I tossed it to make room for more current scientific
<br>
and culturally minded material. And this is a shame, actually because if I
<br>
squint my eyes, my bookcase is leaning more toward one direction instead of
<br>
my preferred fluid flow of knowledge.
<br>
<p>Regarding the Enneagram, what I appreciate greatly from this type of tool
<br>
is the ability to differentiate personality types and recognize what is
<br>
going on under the surface.  It just plain feels good when there is a
<br>
gleaning of insight from others, including oneself, instead of unnecessary
<br>
psychological side-tracking.
<br>
<p>There is a book that I refer to from time to time.  Although it's not based
<br>
on a specific way of interpreting information, it is based on archetypical
<br>
patterns within the characters. Which characters you identify with enables
<br>
a recognition of archetypical patterings.  The book is a fantasy book
<br>
titled _Medicine Woman_.  However the author would like readers to believe
<br>
her fantasy to be true,  from my own experience living with the Navajo
<br>
Indians, and being adopted into the tribe by the medicine man, I know that
<br>
both her story as well as Carlos Castanada's story are fanciful illusions.
<br>
This is not to discredit fanciful illusions, especially when written by
<br>
skilled authors who can take an archetype and fling it out in such a way
<br>
that the reader is consumed by the journey.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is simply another self-knowing tool.
</em><br>
<p>As is that stunning harvest moon last night, thanks Amara.
