<p>I read a newspaper column about 10 years ago about the president of a
<br>
Northern California cryonics organization - I think it was Trans Time.
<br>
It was really sad.  The reporter was pressing him on why he wanted to
<br>
be frozen, what he was hoping to gain in the future, and he eventually
<br>
admitted that he just wanted to live his youth over again.  He grew up
<br>
in the 50s and it was a very nostalgic time for him, and he felt that
<br>
in the future it would be possible for him to be young again and relive
<br>
those happy days.
<br>
<p>It was sad to see him admitting to such a base and trivial motive for
<br>
his efforts.  On the other hand, maybe he's right, and this kind of
<br>
emotional masturbation would indeed be possible in some form.  It seems
<br>
like a lot of work to go through just to put your mind into a meaningless
<br>
cycle of pleasure, though.  Maybe they can just thaw out his pleasure
<br>
centers and skip the rest.
