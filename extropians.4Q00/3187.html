<p><em>&gt;Due to the lingering effects of the patriarchy most guys are arrogant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;selfish twits who shouldn't be allowed out in polite society. :-)
</em><br>
<p>funny
<br>
<p>twits ?    no ...
<br>
arrogant ? no ...  lots of bluster.. but it's transparent quickly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough
<br>
<p><p>selfish ? yes, no doubt, and not the &quot;good&quot; selfish resulting from the basic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;human needs of living for oneself, but the selfish that results from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a kind of tunnel vision, unable to see outside of a range of vision,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;often concluding in careless actions.
<br>
<p><p>To me, the interaction with other humans is simple, an extension
<br>
of &quot;Know Thyself&quot;: every action has consequences, so then take a look
<br>
at one's own actions and notice the consequences. If you can't see
<br>
the consequences very well, then step in another's shoes to see. And
<br>
if the consequences are not valuable, then don't interact with other humans.
<br>
I have very little understanding of careless interactions, maybe because
<br>
I don't, or I consciously try not to, treat people carelessly. I've
<br>
seen careless behavior much more in men, than in women.
<br>
<p>For me, every interaction with someone has meaning. If I communicate
<br>
in some way, then it means that I gave that interaction some thought,
<br>
I put it at the top of my priority list and I expressed myself, no matter
<br>
what cost to me (and sometimes the cost is quite high). If an interaction
<br>
with a person was not meaningful to me, then I don't give them any
<br>
thought. My interaction has this weight, whether I told someone
<br>
congratulations  (more often), or I told someone that I was adversely
<br>
affected by their actions (more rare).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of them have ingrained &quot;me man, you my woman&quot; BS at some level that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;precludes real equality in a male-female relationship.
</em><br>
<p>maybe cultural ... I've observed that perspective more in Europe,
<br>
than in the U.S.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Many men are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still scared shitless of a woman as smart/capable (or heaven forbid)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;smarter than themselves.
</em><br>
<p>Many ? Maybe &quot;some&quot;. And those fears are easy to see too, often being
<br>
manifested by the fellow in a kind of &quot;controlling&quot; behavior.
