<p>Actually, Zeb did post part of the AP story. I was wrong about it being a

state governor -- the proposal was made by Mayor Keith Holliday of 
<br>
Greensboro, N.C.
<br>
<p>I find the death penalty a difficult issue. Like you, Alex, I don't trust 
<br>
the state with this kind of power. Mistakes *will* be made. On the other 
<br>
hand, some people should be killed for their crimes, or else kept in 
<br>
life-long solitary confinement where they cannot harm again. I'm talking 
<br>
about multiple murderers/rapists who exhibit sociopathic qualities. (Think 
<br>
of the character Billy--played by the brilliant Sam Rockwell, in The Green 
<br>
Mile...) HOWEVER, looking ahead, so long as we have a death penalty (or for 
<br>
the days that I reluctantly support it), having perps put into suspension 
<br>
for 50 years would allow those who insist on their innocence to make a 
<br>
case. Of course, things never work out exactly as intended. Once possible 
<br>
side-effect would be (if people started taking cryonics seriously) that 
<br>
more appeals might be turned down, &quot;since you will have a second chance 
<br>
anyway&quot;.
<br>
<p>Even if the suspended perp is very definitely guilty (caught live on 
<br>
multiple video or independent and unimpeachable eyewitnesses) or no one 
<br>
ever can cast doubt on their guilt, I *still* would rather suspend them 
<br>
than destroy them. I'm more comfortable with being able to offer them the 
<br>
choice in the future when revival is possible and inexpensive: Now that 
<br>
we've brought you back, you have a choice: Either we execute you (since we 
<br>
can't let you run around freely with a destructive personality) or we can 
<br>
alter your brain just enough to ensure that you don't want to initiate 
<br>
aggression. Yes, more problems arise in that scenario, but at least the 
<br>
person is given a chance. Since I don't believe in Evil People (but do 
<br>
think that certain actions and behaviors can be called evil), I would 
<br>
rather offer someone redemption ever if they have done horrible things.
