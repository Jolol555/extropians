<p>Jeff, you purist!  You know I think the world of you bud, but I disagree
<br>
all to hell on this.  I guess that makes me an impurist.  Always wanted to
<br>
be an impurist.  {8^D
<br>
<p>Everyone who is suspended is a potential asset to all
<br>
of those who are suspended, for the contents of their memories will be
<br>
used to help build a more realistic simulations of the world that existed
<br>
at the time of their suspension.  Furthermore, I have no doubt that by
<br>
the time we manage to resurrect the frozen, we will be able to make
<br>
a good person out of one that was bad.
<br>
<p>Think it over: freezing, then curing prisoners *is* about hope, progress,
<br>
rationalism, cultural honesty!  And what could be more compassionate?
<br>
We know that elderly people often lose interest in life.  Prisoners facing
<br>
execution provide a class of people who *want* to live, who *recognize*
<br>
theyve made a terrible mistake.
<br>
<p>And who knows, that class *might* include a few who killed someone who,
<br>
as Mike Lorrey likes to say, desperately needed killin.  An example would
<br>
be a case where two yahoos were doing an armed robbery, went to pistol
<br>
whip the victim, the weapon fired, killing his partner in crime.  The first
<br>
criminal was charged with murder.  I say, hey, lets freeze the bastard, he
<br>
might be repairable later.  spike
