<em>&gt; This is an amusing joke, but not an accurate definition.  If you look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up philosophy in the dictionary, you will find that it is the inquiry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the nature of things based on logical reasoning rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empirical methods.
</em><br>
<p>It's that &quot;rather than&quot; which prompts me to label philosophy the art of
<br>
asking the wrong questions. If a certain Greek philosopher had used an
<br>
empirical method (counting his wife's teeth) instead of simply asserting
<br>
that women have a different number of teeth than men, I think he would have
<br>
done better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The concepts of logic, proof methods, debate, critical thinking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalism, and even scientific method and peer review are all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophies for finding the truth.
</em><br>
<p>Well, they're *methods* for finding the truth, but since they don't all use
<br>
logical reasoning *rather than* empirical methods, they can't (by the
<br>
dictionary definition) *all* be called philosophies. &lt;note to self: add &quot;the
<br>
truth&quot; to list of useless hypotheses&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Law, ethics, professionalism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules of conduct, contracts, business, monetary systems, economics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political systems, corporate organization, and even freedom itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are philosophical systems for explaining different areas of our lives.
</em><br>
<p>I think Law uses empirical evidence when it comes to the real nitty gritty
<br>
of court cases, and the body of litigation is based on precedent, not
<br>
philosophy. Ethics is just a formal term for moralism in practice.
<br>
Professionalism includes philosophy insofar as the profession in question is
<br>
philosophical rather than real. Rules of conduct are sorted out by the
<br>
device of conducting business and observing the results, then making rules
<br>
which allow productive conduct of business to continue and to thrive. To the
<br>
extent contracts, business, monetary systems, economics, political systems
<br>
corporate organization, and even freedom itself rely on philosophy rather
<br>
than empirical methods and science, it seems to me they fail.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even transhumanism, extropianism, the extropian principals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immortalism, and non-mysticism discussed on this list are examples of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy.  Are all the concepts bogus?  I think not.  I think they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are examples of good philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't say these were &quot;bogus&quot; I wrote that philosophy is the art of asking
<br>
the wrong questions. In this respect, you are a champion philosopher, since
<br>
you have asked a wrong question (&quot;Are all the concepts bogus?&quot;) which moves
<br>
off in an entirely contrary direction from my assertion about philosophy. I
<br>
think philosophy asks the wrong questions because, although philosophers may
<br>
know some practical and right questions (those that can be decisively
<br>
answered via empirical methods), finding things out that way is too much
<br>
like work, it's often boring and tedious, and if the work's done right, it
<br>
puts and end to the question. Without unanswerable questions, philosophy
<br>
dies. So, philosophy wants to ask why, instead of how, what, where, when.
<br>
The best philosophical questions are those that no philosopher has answered
<br>
(or can answer) conclusively. That gives philosophers their best reason to
<br>
go on philosophizing instead of doing some real work. I love to
<br>
philosophize, and have wasted many hours doing so. Philosophy provides a
<br>
primary vehicle for some folks to socialize. The Art of Asking the Wrong
<br>
Questions is the oldest and greatest game humans have invented.
<br>
<p>Philosophy is to knowledge as masturbation is to sex. They both feel good,
<br>
and everyone does it, but it doesn't get the real job done.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>

<p>=====================
<br>
Useless hypotheses: consciousness, phlogiston, vitalism, mind, free will
<br>
<p>&quot; ...and the business of philosophy is to show that we are not fools for
<br>
doing what we want to do.&quot;
<br>
--Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.
