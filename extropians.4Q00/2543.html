<p>Thanks, but I'm still not back to the fitness level I had 15 years ago. 
<br>
When I hit that pace again, I'll be sure to brag here. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;For everybody else, we're talking about training based on maximum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heart rate formulas, the formula:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;220-age=maximum heart rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;220-age X 65%= start of training range.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;220-age X 85%= top end of normal training range
</em><br>
<p>I've been suspicious of the validity of this guide for a while, even though 
<br>
it's very commonly cited. While I was at Kronos, I expressed my doubts to 
<br>
the exercise specialist, noting that I've measured my heart rate above the 
<br>
age-related theoretical maximum. She agreed, saying that it wasn't a 
<br>
reliable guide. I expect it's a reasonable first cut so that people have an 
<br>
idea of their training range, but if you've been exercising consistently I 
<br>
think you can go higher than those ranges.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;These are the recommended training ranges ( for mere mortals ;) )
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If I remember Max's age right (33?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;220-33=187 (100%)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;220-33 x 65% = 121.55
</em><br>
<em>&gt;220-33 x 85% = 158.95
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Anything above 85% is anaerobic territory, ultra athletic range.
</em><br>
<p>I'm 36 (37 in two months), so my maximum would supposedly be 220 - 36 = 
<br>
184, but I *know* my maximum is significantly higher than that. I aim to 
<br>
keep my heart rate no higher than 175 (though I like to finish by pushing 
<br>
myself harder, moving it up into the 180 range). Since I can sustain that 
<br>
for my 23-35 minutes runs I must be in the aerobic zone, though at the 
<br>
upper range for much of the run. I'll probably stop pushing myself quite so 
<br>
hard once I improve to a 7.0 minute per mile pace -- still below what I did 
<br>
15 years ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I've been eyeing a Polar for awhile now, what model did you pick?
</em><br>
<p>I have the Polar Beat, though the Polar Pacer looks even better, especially 
<br>
if you're running outside and don't have a treadmill to tell you the 
<br>
elapsed time.
