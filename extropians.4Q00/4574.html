<em>&gt; &gt;      Thesius's ship should be preserved, since it is a peice of Greek
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; history. They keep it docked, but it starts to decay. Every time a peice
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wood decays even a bit, it is replaced with a freh board. Eventually,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; board has been replaced. Is it still Thesius's ship? If no, at what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was it no longer that ship? When did it lose it's &quot;Thesius's ship&quot;-ness?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is still Thesius' ship. If you want to know how, observe the workers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;replacing the decayed boards with fresh boards. If you want to know when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where, pay attention to these details. If you want to know whose ship it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find Thesius' descendents and heirs. If you want to know why, you're a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosopher, and Thesius probably wouldn't want you on the ship.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Furthermore, a scrap dealer stumbles upon all the semi-rotting wood 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has been removed from Thesius's ship. He takes it, and, since it's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; completely rotten, he actually assembles a ship from it, he has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;re-assmbled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Thesius's original ship. He docks it next to the first ship. Which one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really Thesius's ship?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you were paying attention to the how, and where, and when, and whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relating to Thesius' ship, then you'd know that Thesius (or his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;preservationist descendents, if he's dead) still has his reconstructed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ship,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and that the scrap dealer has the rotten original ship. No mystery there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;None of this requires philosophy. It just needs observation, direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experience to verify facts, and empirical evidence to ascertain correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt;identities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Someone came to give a philosophy talk at the college I went to and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;argued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they both are, and that this teaches us something about objects and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; space. His hypothesis was that this proves that an object can be in two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; places at the same time. Amazing! Thesius's ship was in two places at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same time, docked right next to eachother.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That helps to explain why some people call it &quot;fool-osophy.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The reason this peice of philosophy is valuable is because it takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sense&quot; hidden assumptions about the nature of objects and applies it to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem, which leads to a nonsensical result and shows that the common
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assumptions about objects, the premises by which most people think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; objects, are false. If you're a good philosopher, you're going to figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why these wrong questions are the wrong questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nice try, but no kewpie doll. This piece of sh...  excuse me, this piece of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophy is worthless because it pretends to offer solutions, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(un)common sense reveals more valuable information. The advantage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(un)common sense (sense is really not that common) is that it doesn't lead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to nonsensical results. When you come to your senses (stop philosophizing),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things look much more clear. If you're a good philosopher, you'll keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt;asking the wrong questions to insure that you don't run out of work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To me, science is the most uncommon kind of sense. Especially 21st century
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science, because it requires the greatest precision and accuracy in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;empirical experiments that humans have ever attempted. I mean, super
</em><br>
<em>&gt;colliders and space telescopes are fairly uncommon. You need hardware to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This reminds me of an Edelman story. Apparently the science department was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in trouble because it had such a huge expense account. The math department
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bragged that it only needed chalk, paper, and a few waste paper baskets. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the philosophy department did even better. They didn't even need waste
</em><br>
<em>&gt;baskets. Get it? The philosophers didn't throw out their wrong questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Stay hungry,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;--J. R.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3M TA3
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;=====================
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Useless hypotheses: consciousness, phlogiston, vitalism, mind, free will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think my sarcastic tone in some of the above may have been lost in the 
<br>
text. My overall point: this &quot;philosopher&quot; giving this talk was an idiot. He 
<br>
was an idiot because he took common sense premises (which are always poorly 
<br>
defined) and came up with ridiculous conclusions. Conclusions which he 
<br>
believed to be true. What you can get out of this, even this peice of bad 
<br>
philosophy, is to see the consequences of these premises and to come up with 
<br>
better premises.
