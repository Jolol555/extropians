The second type of perpetual motion machine,

A large volume of phase space, describing
<br>
the probability amplitude that an electron
<br>
is present at all points of space, collapses
<br>
into a single point which describes the electron
<br>
as being present at a single point in space.
<br>
State-vector reduction takes zillions of possible
<br>
superposed Universes and annihilates all but one of them.
<br>
Thus, it may be possible to build a quantum perpetual
<br>
motion machine in which the amplitudes &quot;cold states&quot;
<br>
tend to add up while the amplitudes of &quot;hot states&quot;
<br>
cancel out; effectively, this dumps waste heat into
<br>
a superposed state that gets blipped out of existence
<br>
when the quantum collapse occurs.
<br>
<p><p>Since measurement on a quantum system seems to be
<br>
an irreversible process one would say that, performing
<br>
such a measurement, the entropy should increase
<br>
(John von Neumann,the projection postulate, about 1930).
<br>
But the entropy change occuring, without measurement,
<br>
in an isolated quantum system and the entropy change due
<br>
to measurement are, of course, different (in the later
<br>
case some amount of information can be obtained).
<br>
So, how this information gain must be paid for?
<br>
And, If we look for the entropy change when the unitary
<br>
evolution of a quantum system is interrupted by a
<br>
&quot;sequence&quot; of measurements, how does entropy change?
<br>
&quot;Repeated&quot; measurements, with same result, on a quantum
<br>
system, reiterate resettings of the evolving wave function.
<br>
It brings about even an impediment of the evolution, when
<br>
the temporal separation of the detections is reduced, and
<br>
the interaction approaches to &quot;continuous&quot; measurement.
<br>
Well, the answer seems to be that: &quot;repeated&quot; measurements
<br>
on a quantum system tends to decrease the entropy
<br>
of this quantum system; a &quot;continuous&quot; measurement
<br>
on a quantum system tends to reduce the entropy to zero.
<br>
Of course it is somewhat counter-intutive that &quot;repeated&quot;
<br>
measurements decrease the entropy of a quantum system.
<br>
This &quot;Zeno&quot; effect is, perhaps, suggesting another
<br>
perpetual motion weird machine!
