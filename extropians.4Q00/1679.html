</em><br>
<p><p>Suppose we know that the true theory of everything is of the form T, and 
<br>
that it has one free parameter, a physical constant k that, on theoretical 
<br>
grounds, can take on any integer value between 1 and 1,000,000. But there 
<br>
is no a priori ground, let's assume, why k should have one of these values 
<br>
rather than another. So by a principle of indifference, we assign each of 
<br>
these possibilities an equal probability. Now consider the specific 
<br>
hypotheses Tn:=&quot;T and k=n&quot; for n=1, ..., 1,000,000. Probability calculus 
<br>
then implies that the probability of Tn &lt;= 1/1,000,000. In other words, 
<br>
each of these specific hypotheses must be highly a priori improbable since 
<br>
they are mutually exclusive and their combined probability cannot exceed 1.
<br>
<p>Note that we are not talking about physical chances here. (There might well 
<br>
not be a nontrivial physical chance that a physical constant should have 
<br>
had a different value than it actually has; that's an open empirical 
<br>
question.) Rather, we are talking rational epistemic probabilities - 
<br>
degrees of belief. Even if it was in some sense physically necessary that 
<br>
k=42925, so that the physical chance of k=42925 is 1, this is compatible 
<br>
with our prior epistemic probability of k=42925 being very small.
