<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would say that 45 minutes of strongly aerobic exercise five times a week
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is excessive. I think you can get virtually the same health benefit from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; around 25 minutes four times a week, with far less free radical formation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I'd have to disagree.. my understanding (feel free to prove me wrong) is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you really have to do a minimum of 30 minutes of steady aerobic exercise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to really have any effect on your cardio system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have to disagree with your disagreement. :-)  Aerobic conditioning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly begins no later than 10 minutes after training range is attained.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 25 minutes gives you most of the preventive health benefits. I'll go look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this up when I have more time. But I can say that I wouldn't have gotten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a high aerobic fitness rating in my Kronos Clinic testing if what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say is true. I never continue aerobic exercise past 25 minutes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I'm talking about aerobic exercise, I'm not referring to girly-man low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heart rate exercise. ;-)  I'm talking about maintaining my heart rate at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the upper end of the fitness training range. (Last night's 3 mile run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly brought my heart rate up to 165, then it climbed to 170-180 for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of the workout. I use a Polar heart monitor--this is cool tech that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lets you see your heart rate in real time on a watch or displayed on most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treadmills.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 45 minutes several times a week might be needed to get most of the benefits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if someone is training a lower level of intensity. According to Dr. Kenneth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cooper, running any more than 15 miles per week will not bring increased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health benefits. If I were to run for 45 minutes five days a week at close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to my current pace, I'd cover about 30 miles. At my pace, 25 minutes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several times a week seems just about optimal.
</em><br>
<p>Ahh ok. I exercise a little easier than that, I use a machine that varies
<br>
its intensity (using a Polar monitor :-) to keep my heart rate between 130
<br>
and 163.. usually it ends up staying around 160 for most of the workout.
<br>
My goals are perhaps a bit different, I prefer the longer workouts since I
<br>
want to improve my endurance for sports like mountain biking where you have
<br>
to sustain a moderate to high level of exertion for an hour or longer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This is the part that I find a little off-putting.. like I said if it helps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you in your job or whatever that's a good thing. But other than that, I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it as a waste of time to try to attain some kind of &quot;look&quot; and hold it. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;could understand it if you are planning to try to maintain a physical body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;far into the future... some people dig that, but myself I prefer to just be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;uploaded and modify my body image at will after that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When do you expect to be uploaded? I'm not willing to wait for a future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology to save my body, not knowing when it will happen. The clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health, strength, and mood-enhancing benefits of resistance exercise give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me clear reasons to do it. The enhanced body image is an enjoyable plus. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading takes decades (which I think fairly likely but practically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unknowable) then I will have decades to enjoy the results of my exercise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I'll be a vigorous grey-haired guy while wait-for-uploading folks will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be shuffling around and asking for    a hand with their luggage. :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Weight-training does have clear health benefits such as stronger, healthier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bones, reduced LDL levels, and lowers total cholesterol, among other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things. Some references:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Goldberg, L., et. al. Journal of the American Medical Association 252
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1984); 504
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Larsson, B., et. al. International Journal of Sports Medicine 6 (5) (Dec
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1984): 336-340
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am not planning on any certain uploading date either; I just am questioning
<br>
the claimed life extending qualities of weight training in addition to good
<br>
aerobic exercise. Especially for younger people.
