<p><em>&gt;Beta Pic has a dust disk around it, doesn't it?
</em><br>
<p>Yup. Edge-on.. ~1000 AU extended from the star.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Pretty trippy to think of a star fifty light years away as a clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dust source here.
</em><br>
<p>See, I thought it would boggle the mind, once given the thought :-).
<br>
<p>Think: it's the first interstellar contact (even if they are just
<br>
dust particles ...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What are typical speeds of these particles when they arrive in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neighborhood?
</em><br>
<p>They travel at speeds up to 75 km/sec (45 km/sec with respect to the
<br>
Sun).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I see that some folks claim dust rings in the disk might have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;formed by a star passing beta Pic only 100kyears ago. Is that enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time for dust to arrive here? What I'm trying to get at is, has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dust been arriving all along from the disk, or is it a result of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recent &quot;swirls&quot; associated with ring formation? Hmm.
</em><br>
<p>Until someone finds some other kinds of data, we only have our current
<br>
radar meteor observations to know, so I don't know.
<br>
<p>The mechanisms are fascinating though. I would love to have it as
<br>
my thesis topic, if I didn't already have a thesis topic (below).
<br>
<p>For a dust particle to escape from beta Pic, it would have to be
<br>
accelerated to greater than beta Pic's escape velocity. What might do
<br>
that? If the dust particles are small enough, then the Lorentz force
<br>
(from beta Pic's magnetic field) would do it.
<br>
<p>For example, dust from Io's volcanoes in the Jovian system is
<br>
accelerated enough by Lorentz forces (Jupiter's magnetic field) to
<br>
escape Jupiter and be detected outside Jupiter's magnetosphere by
<br>
the Ulysses, Galileo, and Cassini spacecraft. The picture that we
<br>
have for the Io dust (&quot;Jovian dust streams&quot;) is a little like a
<br>
&quot;dust sprinkler system&quot;, spewing the dust in all orientations (here
<br>
is my thesis topic). The magnetic field of Jupiter can act as a mass
<br>
spectrometer, selecting the smallest particles to be accelerated the
<br>
most, so then the spacecraft see mostly the tiny nanometer-sized
<br>
particles.
<br>
<p>But the beta Pic particles are 40 microns... rather large to be
<br>
dominated by Lorentz forces, which dominate submicron sized
<br>
particles.
<br>
<p>So what other force mechanism? Can gravity accelerate 40 micron
<br>
sized particles from there to here? Can radiation pressure force? I
<br>
don't know.
<br>
<p>Also, the interstellar beta Pic dust particles have to be the right
<br>
the size and velocity (and charge and other bulk properties) to
<br>
enter our solar sytem. The particles are too big to be embedded in
<br>
the interstellar gas flow that flows through our solar system. The
<br>
dust particles' optical (etc.) properties are such that they can
<br>
penetrate deep into our heliosphere, to Earth, which means that
<br>
radiation pressure force from our Sun is not blowing them out. Or
<br>
perhaps it is, but on different sized particles than the ones that
<br>
we are detecting (duh).
<br>
<p>OK, so thinking out loud. I haven't worked out any of this, however,
<br>
probably Jack Baggaley, the New Zealand radar researcher who
<br>
reported the results, has, no doubt, considered these things.
<br>
<p>Still mind boggling.
