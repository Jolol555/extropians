Perhaps this is the first time a largescale election was close enough to
<br>
expose all the fraud and mistakes, or threaten to do so. Twenty thousand
<br>
mutilated ballots is too many, as is one.
<br>
<p>It's so that under the United States' aegis is the single most powerful
<br>
military force on the planet, and also, that it is only one of more than
<br>
200 countries, and that the United States has less than %5 of world
<br>
population, and slightly more of its land mass.
<br>
<p>China plans to launch some people into space, the countries that have
<br>
done so at this point have put less than 500 (perhaps), and no Americans
<br>
never returned (of those that made it to space).
<br>
<p>About the election, it appears that no candidate can claim a popular
<br>
majority vote, only a plurality.  The United States government does not
<br>
have proportional representation, thus there is only representation of
<br>
the two entrenched parties.
<br>
<p>Well, it is the time forevermore for each citizen to have complete
<br>
access to all government information (give or take a few).  There must
<br>
be redundant systems for the people to pinch every single government
<br>
penny, if only to test its value.  Every political contribution of any
<br>
form to any party or politician should be itemized and made ready to any
<br>
citizen at any time.

<p>I think the best government for a sophisticated and evolved society
<br>
would be a semi-automated Athenian democracy, where any salient issue is
<br>
brought to public vote almost any time necessary, and the business side
<br>
is run by powerful artificial intelligence.
