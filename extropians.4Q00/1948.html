<p><em>&gt; As for Dan's comments, well I'm finding it hard to believe this is the same

</em><br>
<p>Establishing ground rules IS crucial to Spontaneous Order.  But an
<br>
essential premise of Spontaneous Order is that there are certain
<br>
rules, certain kinds of rules, which are totally unneccessary, even
<br>
bad to establish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And self-direction does not mean letting anyone who feels like it take a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dump on your carpet or walk around your home smashing your furniture and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insulting your family and friends.
</em><br>
<p>Dumping on your carpet?  No.  Insulting your family and friends?
<br>
Maybe.
<br>
<p>Consider the following argument: if by speech alone I can harm you
<br>
against your will, then speech is force.  If this is true, then
<br>
whether or not you're a &quot;[L|l]ibertarian&quot;, it seems there should be severe
<br>
restrictions on how and when people can initiate speech, just like how
<br>
there are severe restrictions on taking dumps on other people's
<br>
carpets.
<br>
<p>If you don't agree with that conclusion, then modus tollens tells me
<br>
that the following claim holds: unrestricted speech is a good idea,
<br>
because, although sticks and stones can break our bones, words can
<br>
never hurt us.
<br>
<p>Words can never hurt us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for making it look like we have something to hide--you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely lost me here. *Anyone* can get on the list simply by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; letting us know their name and how to reach them (information which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be kept confidential). If they are unwilling to accord us this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then more likely *they* have something to hide.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Dan, why does ExI have this policy?&quot;  &quot;Because some people have come
<br>
on this list and posted things we didn't want said.  They said bad
<br>
things, and this policy is designed so that if somebody slanders again,
<br>
we'll be able to take appropriate action against them.
<br>
<p>&quot;After all, if they're not intending to slander us, then they have
<br>
nothing to hide, right?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Its funny that no one has apparently even noticed that other organizations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparable to ExI DO NOT EVEN PROVIDE A PUBLIC FORUM. Organizations like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Foresight send email to their people, but don't provide an open forum like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this. Why do you suppose that might be? Why are we being criticized so much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for asking so little before allowing complete strangers into our much loved 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and long-inhabited on-line home?
</em><br>
<p>Because we know how good it can get.  Because fewer restrictions are
<br>
better than more restrictions, even if you're the guy with the least
<br>
restrictions around.
