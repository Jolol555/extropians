</em><br>
<em>&gt; only have their heart's desire within a tailored VR.  Again, they get to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; they get to move into whatever that new thing is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Looked at this way the VR might be the best choice that preserves the

<p>Why not just give crims an environment where they can do what they like; go
<br>
around slaughtering people if you want. Basically it's just Doom anyway.
<br>
What's all this karma crap?
