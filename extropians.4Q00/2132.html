<em>&gt; Hey, Harvey.  You're down there in Ft. Lauderdale, right?  What's the buzz
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this fiasco up close and personal?
</em><br>
<p>Funny you should ask.  There are two points that I have not seen reported
<br>
nationally.
<br>
<p>First:
<br>
There was a time limit for voting in Palm Beach county.  If voters could not
<br>
figure out the ballot or get help within 5 minutes, their time was up and
<br>
they were told to vote immediately and leave.  Employees working at the
<br>
polling place said that they did not have enough people or time to help
<br>
everybody who asked.  Many people were ushered out before they could get
<br>
their questions answered.  Asking for help did not extend one's time limit.
<br>
<p>Second:
<br>
The recount by Florida counties has lessened the gap between Gore and Bush
<br>
to 229 with two counties still counting!  The Republican Supervisor of
<br>
Elections has decided that counties that changed their numbers (in favor of
<br>
Gore) are &quot;disputed&quot; and will not be reported in this recount!  She is using
<br>
the original numbers for counties that changed and new numbers for counties
<br>
that didn't change, with the predictable result that the reported recount
<br>
still shows Bush having a 1700 vote lead.  This does not match what the
<br>
counties reported, and will not be the certified results.  A third recount
<br>
is being called in four counties.  Those numbers will become the certified
<br>
numbers and are not due until Tuesday.
