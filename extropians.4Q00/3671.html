Alex,
<br>
<p>I'm a student of linguistics and German, and although I can't write much at
<br>
the moment (finals week), I'll make a few brief comments:
<br>
<p>Whether language evolved seperately among two or more groups of primitive
<br>
humans is certainly an interesting question, and one which has
<br>
ramifications well outside linguistics proper.  If the answer were yes, the
<br>
obvious follow-up question would be: what cognitive traits did these groups
<br>
share ancestrally that put them in a position to develop language
<br>
seperately?  However, all evidence seems to point to the contrary, that a
<br>
single group of organisms ancestral to every human alive today had the
<br>
genetic programming for language as we understand it, complete with what we
<br>
think of as syntax, morphology, and phonology.
<br>
<p>Consider three pieces of evidence: first is that an infant raised in a
<br>
linguistic community entirely seperate from its genetic ancestors, seems to
<br>
acquire the environmental language in just the same way as genetically
<br>
native children do.  Second is that a child develops linguistic abilities
<br>
with a significant &quot;poverty of information&quot;, suggesting massive genetic
<br>
programming for linguistic rules, in the areas of syntax, morphology,
<br>
phonetics, and syntax.  Third is the apparent non-neccesity of many
<br>
specific linguistic patterns, making it extremely implausible that exactly
<br>
the same genetic predispositions would have evolved seperately.  Taken
<br>
together, these suggest a common biological ancestry for the genetic
<br>
patterns governing language.  It would hardly make sense, of course, for
<br>
the complex genetic foundation for language to exist without actual
<br>
language existing as well, nor would it make sense for any language
<br>
community or individual to completely abandon one language and start from
<br>
scratch, so it's a pretty solid conclusion that all existing languages have
<br>
a common ancestor.
<br>
<p>In any case, your suggestion that English may be radically unique won't
<br>
hold water.  The example you give, of adjective preceding noun in a simple
<br>
noun phrase, is typical of germanic languages in general.  The idea that
<br>
this could be an evolutionary disadvantage is funny, but pretty
<br>
implausible.  People don't generally need elaborate adjectives to describe
<br>
immediate dangers; that's part of the reason we have the nouns we do to
<br>
begin with, and besides, we seem to be pretty good and inventing simple
<br>
terms when we need them, e.g. the golfer's &quot;Fore!&quot;
<br>
<p>In recent times, and in the future, we should expect to find an evolution
<br>
of language in line with a radically different environment.  A very
<br>
difficult subject there with much room for exploration.
