<em>&gt; If the androidization is voluntary, then the android you is, or should be,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contractually satisfied with his physiological enhancement, but the the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence of the chimpish you creates an unexpected and undesired dilution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of identity rights.  The new you and the old you are equally desirous of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being the real you, but the old you has precedence.  The new you has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deprived of the exclusive possession of the &quot;you&quot; persona, to which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exclusive possession he had had a reasonable expectation going into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedure, ie when he WAS you.  Now the old you is still the real you and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the new you is a 'mere' enhanced copy.  Bad break.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Which entity is &quot;you&quot;?  Any of them?  All of them?  Some of them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I became aware of in this little exercise was that the issue of &quot;Who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is you?&quot; seems to separate in a rights issue and an identity issue, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (if you don't rigorously segregate the two) the latter subordinate to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; former.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First you 'own' the rights to your identity and to choose whatever that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be.  In the absence of personally-asserted first-person identity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights, third-party-assessed identity authenticity is materially-based,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; a matter of degree.  Originality defines the highest degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authenticity, the original you in the original body, sliding gradually
</em><br>
away
<br>
<em>&gt; through amnesiac, comatose, brain-wiped, deanimate frozen, deanimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decayed, the various permutations of copies, to urn of ashes and fading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; photograph, and finally to a last fleeting wisp of memory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks, Harvey.  That was fun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Best, Jeff Davis
</em><br>
<p>Jeff, I don't agree...
<br>
<p>The rights issue must be subordinate to the identity issue. Externally, the
<br>
rights issue will be what matters (who, after all, owns all your stuff?),
<br>
but subjectively, to you, the question of identity is paramount, and is most
<br>
likely obvious; you are you, and that's that.
<br>
<p>I think in this case, the android is closest to you. However, with the
<br>
erasure+reinstatement, this must be a new instance of you. I think the
<br>
original died, with the amnesia. Whether the procedure was voluntary or not
<br>
changes nothing. If you go through a copy upload scenario, which involves
<br>
scanning you, running a new version in another substrate, and then banging
<br>
the original on the head with a hammer (messy cleanup to avoid messy
<br>
identity or at least rights issues), then that upload is not the same
<br>
subjective you, irrespective of whether you participated voluntarily or not.
