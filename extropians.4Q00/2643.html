<em>&gt; &gt; Oh, don't tempt us to answer that!  It probably ended because you knew
</em><br>
too
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; little to fully appreciate it.  It appears the lack has not been
</em><br>
corrected
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; subsequently.   Or do you just prefer infallible popery?   I know, I
</em><br>
know,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you are actually a total relativist so you can't be pinned down on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you may say, do or think or in any wise be held accountable for any of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; uncountable opinions.  You prefer to be walking vapor-person.  Have fun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, believe me, I had learned enough.  I'd learned enough to know that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really doesn't matter a bit.  I began to look in the mirror and realize
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; tomorrow, I will die.  It doesn't matter if tomorrow is tomorrow, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tomorrow is sixty years, or if tomorrow is sixty million years- I will
</em><br>
die.
<br>
<em>&gt; In the end, the dream is over.  In the end, it's all just opinion.  There
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; no truth unless it is created, and no laws except the ones we impose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fantasy is merely reality without inhibitions.  As for being a &quot;walking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vapor-person&quot;, I seem to be more aware of the nature of life than the
</em><br>
people
<br>
<em>&gt; I seem to meet and work with every day, who actually think that they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplishing something!  Or that, perhaps, they are right about
</em><br>
something!
<br>
<em>&gt; Yet, I'm afraid, everyone is wrong.  Everyone is, essentially, a walking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corpse, a doomed machine thinking that they actually have this fiction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called &quot;free will&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Nicq
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why the vehemence, in the face of determinism? Have you magically attained
<br>
the free-will that escapes the masses?
