This means that the Jupiter Science planned during the last 1 1/2 yrs
<br>
for the time when Cassini flies by Jupiter (which is now and through
<br>
end of this year, the closest approach Dec 30) is currently on
<br>
hold. Engineers are working on it.
<br>
<p>(Galileo science from inside of the Jovian magnetosphere are still on
<br>
track, however).

<p>Cassini Weekly Significant Events
<br>
for 12/14/00 - 12/19/00
<br>
<p>The most recent spacecraft telemetry was acquired from the Madrid tracking
<br>
station on Wednesday, December 20.   Telemetry obtained from the
<br>
spacecraft on Sunday, December 17, indicated that on Friday, December 15,
<br>
at about 5:00 PM Pacific Time, during the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer
<br>
(CAPS) Hubble Space Telescope (HST) activity #3, the spacecraft
<br>
transitioned out of Reaction Wheel (RWA) control mode and into Reaction
<br>
Control Subsystem (RCS) mode due to an unusually high level of friction
<br>
seen in reaction wheel #2.  From that time onwards, the CAPS HST #3 activity as
<br>
well as the Optical Remote Sensing (ORS) block #4 (Jupiter North / South
<br>
map and IO eclipse) activities were performed under RCS control.
<br>
<p>Commands were sent to turn the reaction wheels on and spin them up to 308 rpm,
<br>
but not to transition to RWA control. Wheel #2 again exhibited a high level of
<br>
friction up to about 50 rpm. The wheels were turned off and allowed to
<br>
spin down, and the sequence was allowed to continue in RCS control mode. The
<br>
speed of the spacecraft can be viewed on the &quot;Present Position&quot; web page
<br>
( &quot;<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/english/where/">http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/english/where/</a>&quot; )
<br>
<p>The Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) and Visual and Infrared Mapping
<br>
Spectrometer (VIMS) Instrument Expanded Block (IEB) loads were uplinked as
<br>
planned and all planned activities executed as scheduled.
<br>
<p>On Monday, the AACS team presented their analysis of what happened with
<br>
respect to the RWA anomaly. It was decided to terminate the C23 background
<br>
sequence due to the excessive use of hydrazine required to support RCS
<br>
control, and the need for some time to do diagnostic tests to characterize
<br>
the RWA problem.   On Tuesday morning, C23 was deactivated, but with the
<br>
program remaining on board, the spacecraft was placed on Earth point, and
<br>
a second RWA friction test was performed.  A preliminary analysis of the
<br>
results from this test do not show any further signs of increased friction
<br>
levels, but further analysis and characterization activities are planned
<br>
before consideration of resuming the science sequence.  All instruments
<br>
are currently in a safe configuration and the flight team is working to
<br>
resolve this issue.
<br>
<p>Instrument Operations (IO) and the Multi Mission Image Processing
<br>
Laboratory (MIPL) produced and delivered 1583 ISS images and 1213 VIMS
<br>
cubes this week, bringing the totals for Jupiter Encounter to date up to
<br>
14612 images and 1328 cubes.
<br>
<p>A Rings Working Group teleconference was held this week by Science
<br>
Planning.  Discussion centered on plans for ring observations during the
<br>
tour in support of development of the Science Operations Plan.
<br>
<p>Development continues for the Cruise 24 and 25 sequences.  The draft
<br>
version of the C24 Preliminary Sequence Integration &amp; Validation (PSIV)
<br>
package has been distributed for review.  The PSIV meeting will be held on
<br>
January 2 after the holidays.  Stripped subsequences for C25 were released
<br>
for the Sequence Virtual Team (SVT) to populate with commands.
<br>
<p>Cassini is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and
<br>
the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the
<br>
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif., manages the Cassini
<br>
mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
