The article which Robin pointed to is available in PDF format for a $5
<br>
charge.  In order to make it more accessible, I have taken the liberty
<br>
of manually typing in section 2.2, where they make their main case for
<br>
time inconsistency, and I offer it here for future criticism.
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that this article is offered as an argument for government
<br>
intervention into the decisions of private individuals.  Individuals
<br>
consistently regret their past actions, according to this argument, and
<br>
a wise and enlightened government will therefore intervene to coerce or
<br>
persuade them into taking a more far-sighted view.  Those who object to
<br>
such paternalistic actions may wish to consider the argument especially
<br>
carefully.
<br>
<p>A couple of notes: having typed it in by hand, typographic errors are
<br>
my fault.  I have not included the bibliographic references, but I can
<br>
supply those on request.
<br>
<p>Also, the authors do refer to one equation from earlier in the paper,
<br>
&quot;delta = 1/beta&quot;.  The idea here is that delta is the discount rate into
<br>
the future, so if it were 0.95 per year that would mean that pleasures
<br>
a year from now are worth 5% less than pleasures I can experience today.
<br>
Beta is the discount rate into the past, so if it were also 0.95 per year
<br>
that would mean a pleasure a year ago was worth 5% less than that same
<br>
pleasure experienced today.  To be time-consistent and avoid regreat,
<br>
delta = 1/beta must be true; i.e if delta is 0.95 then beta must be
<br>
about 1.05, and pleasures a year ago must be 5% MORE valuable than if
<br>
they were experienced today.
<br>
<p>With that introduction, here is section 2.2, excerpted from
<br>

<br>
The Social Discount Rate
<br>
Andrew Caplin, John Leahy
<br>
NBER Working Paper No. W7983 Issued in October 2000
<br>
<p>================================================
<br>
<p>2.2 The Argument for Discounting: Future and Past
<br>
<p>Ever since Bohm-Bawerk [1959] first proposed discounting as one of the
<br>
prime reasons for positive interest rates, there has been near
<br>
unanimity among economists that individuals discount future felicity
<br>
relative to present felicity.[Note 3]  The main argument in favor of
<br>
discounting is empirical.  It appears to be the revealed preference of
<br>
individuals that current pleasure is preferred to future pleasure, and
<br>
future pain to current pain.  Introspection supports this view, as do
<br>
market interest rates in excess of the growth rate of population and
<br>
productivity, and so does the available experimental evidence from
<br>
economics and psychology.[Note 4]
<br>
<p>Given that individuals discount the future, invariance requires that
<br>
agents weight the past more heavily than they do the present.  In
<br>
other words, it requires that a thirty year old cares more about an
<br>
apple that was consumed at age three than about an apple to be
<br>
consumed today.  moreover, the importance of that apple at age three
<br>
relative to an apple today must grow at an exponential rate as the
<br>
consumer ages.
<br>
<p>This implication of invariance is difficult to accept.  Rather than
<br>
viewing past consumption as progressively more important as the
<br>
consumer ages, it is more plausible that agents discount past
<br>
consumption.  When asked most people would prefer having completed an
<br>
onerous task last week over having to perform one this evening; they
<br>
would prefer a pleasurable meal this evening to one ten years ago; and
<br>
they would prefer to be leaving on vacation to returning to work when
<br>
their vacation is over.[Notes 5,6]  Whenever one thinks, &quot;I'm glad it
<br>
is finally three o'clock and that lecture is over,&quot; it reflects
<br>
discounting of the past.  The disagreeable experience is less painful
<br>
when it is in the past than when it is being experienced in the
<br>
present.[Note 7]
<br>
<p>Beyond revealed preference, the strongest theoretical argument in
<br>
favor of discounting, involves what Bohm-Bawerk referred to as the
<br>
&quot;brevity and uncertainty of human life.&quot;  According to this view,
<br>
people discount future felicity because they may not be around to
<br>
enjoy it.  An individual weighs pleasures at date t by the conditional
<br>
probability of living until date t.
<br>
<p>There is a parallel between mortality and forgetfulness.  The past
<br>
dies when we forget.[Note 8]  Do we value today meals eaten ten years
<br>
ago, if we cannot even remember what we ate?  How is our current
<br>
utility reduced by past pains that we cannot even remember?  Imperfect
<br>
memory justifies discounting the past in much the same way that
<br>
mortality justifies discounting the future, and just as mortality
<br>
suggests that we discount the far off future more than the near
<br>
future, imperfect memory suggests that we discount the far off past
<br>
more than the recent past.
<br>
<p>Finally, heterogeneity in discount rates across individuals undermines
<br>
the case for retrospective consistency.  If, as is commonly believed,
<br>
the rich and educated are more forward looking, do they place
<br>
relatively _less_ weight on the past as invariance would require?  To
<br>
the extent that individual discount rates are endogenous, as argued by
<br>
Becker and Mulligan [1997], does the weight on the past adjust to
<br>
maintain delta = 1/beta?  Or is the weight on the past also
<br>
endogenous?  After all, we spend considerable resources keeping the
<br>
past alive, through stories, photographs, souvenirs, and diaries.  If
<br>
the weight on the past is endogenous, wouldn't it be a remarkable
<br>
quirk of fate of [sic] this weight were exactly equal to the inverse
<br>
of the discount factor?
<br>
<p>We conclude that in almost any reasonable formulation, future selves
<br>
weight current consumption less heavily than does the current self.
<br>
The implication is that tastes change over time.  We now consider the
<br>
welfare implications of this observation.
<br>
<p>====
<br>
<p>Note 3.  For a rare statement of dissent see Becker and Stigler
<br>
[1977].
<br>
<p>Note 4.  Although supportive of discounting, the experimental evidence
<br>
does not necessarily support exponential discounting.  See Ainslie
<br>
[1992].
<br>
<p>Note 5.  This last statement assumes that the vacation is a
<br>
pleasurable experience.  For some families this may not be true.  In
<br>
this case the inequality is reversed, but the point is the same.
<br>
<p>Note 6.  There will, of course, be exceptions.  There may be that
<br>
particularly pleasurable occurrence which yields memories for years to
<br>
come, memories so precious that one is glad that the experience was in
<br>
the past so that the memories could be enjoyed over an extended period
<br>
of time.  Similar exceptions, however, apply to discounting the
<br>
future.  One may, for example, want to delay a particularly
<br>
pleasurable event in order to savor the feelings of anticipation that
<br>
it engenders (Loewenstein [1987]).  The existence of a few exceptions,
<br>
however, does not alter the general rule.
<br>
<p>Note 7.  Some suggestive evidence comes from DeGenova [1992] who found
<br>
that when people looked back on their lives they most regretted not
<br>
spending time on education.  Education, being an activity with current
<br>
costs and future rewards, is a prime candidate for retrospective time
<br>
inconsistency.
<br>
<p>Note 8.  The experimental evidence in psychology indicates that
<br>
exponential decay of recall probabilities fits the data rather well,
<br>
although a power function may perform better (See Crovits and
<br>
Schiffman [1974]).
