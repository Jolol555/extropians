<p><em>&gt;&gt;From Extrodot:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Chris Fedeli writes: &quot;On Tuesday, November 28th, extropians and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;DC &gt;locals Keith Lynch, Alan Grimes, and Chris Fedeli demonstrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;against a Greenpeace action protesting the EPA's decision to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;consider Aventis' request for approval of their Starlink
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;genetically modified corn.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;A resounding WELL DONE! to all those involved.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Ditto to that. I wish I could have been there. I suppose that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PR-wise there are drawsbacks to this kind of counterdemonstartion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as others here have pointed out, but emotionally, I love it.
</em><br>
<p>This is one of those issues that will have extropians on both sides
<br>
of the fence.
<br>
<p>I did some quick searching on this, including the EPA factsheet on
<br>
tolworthi (the organism) and its expressed Cry9C protein.
<br>
(Starlink). Note that Starlink uses a modified protein more
<br>
powerfull than that found in the original organism.
<br>
<p>In part 1c they state &quot; EPA does not have any information regarding
<br>
endocrine effects for these kinds of pesticides at this time.&quot; They
<br>
further state that the &quot;company&quot; claims there is some minor
<br>
staining for the presence of carbohydrates&quot; in other words leaving
<br>
the door ajar as to whether it is an allergen.
<br>
<p>Under part 3a they completely discount any exposure to the actual
<br>
toxin since the tests were performed on levels that might result as
<br>
residue from animal feed.
<br>
<p>In part 1 the toxicology assessment part A Acute toxicity, they
<br>
mention that at these residual testing levels some test mice got
<br>
sick, but only the FEMALE mice. CLASSIFICATION Acceptable
<br>
<p>Other fun things:
<br>
<p>&quot;should pest resistance to Cry9c corn be detected in the field
<br>
Aventis has proposed a remedial action plan that calls for
<br>
immediate suspension of seed sales in the affected counties once
<br>
resistance has been confirmed.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the case of polyphagus pests (they feed on more than one
<br>
species) the pests may change food sources in the presence of Bt
<br>
corn.
<br>
<p>In normal use of the toxin, the toxin is activated by the stomach
<br>
conditions of the pest it is inactivated otherwise. In Starlite
<br>
it is expressed as the active toxin.
<br>
<p>So I'm not placing any bets on Bt corn.
<br>
<p>If the biotech industry needs a killer app, the California wine
<br>
regions are facing devastation from the glassy wing sharpshooter,
<br>
maybe they can find some converts there.
