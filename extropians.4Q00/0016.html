<p>&lt;&lt; You still are making claims about the 3rd Reich which you have failed to 
<br>
provide
<br>
&nbsp;any documentation, while I have cited actual eyewitness statements that 
<br>
refute
<br>
&nbsp;your claims. Either come up with something to refute the statements of 
<br>
Speer, et
<br>
&nbsp;al or cease and desist your revisionism. &gt;&gt;
<br>
Speer is about as trust-worthy a source as Hermann Goering. They both were up 
<br>
to their chins with blood and theft. I would recommend Hitler's Willing 
<br>
Executioners by Goldhagen(1996). Another work of interest is Explaining 
<br>
Hitler by Ron Rosenbaum (1999) and I would recommend Nazi Terror: The 
<br>
Gestapo, Jews, and ordinary German Citizens. Are you really going to 
<br>
hair-split when we know that the largest German Electric Company AEG, had 
<br>
documentation discussing supplying power to the Dachau Death Camp? 
<br>
<p>AEG pre-existed before the 3rd Reich ever existed, and probably pre-dated the 
<br>
Weimar Republic. The German insurance company, Allianz (alliance) was afraid 
<br>
it would have to pay indemnities to its Jewish clients after Chrystal Nacht, 
<br>
till Hermann Goering reassured Allianz, it would never have to do so. (The 
<br>
Rise and Fall of the 3rd Reich) By the way, Allianz just payed off some 
<br>
indemnities to their former clients just in 1999, LOL! 
<br>
<p>You know I haven't mentioned what the Belgian Minning companies did to the 
<br>
Central Africans in the llate 19th century. These guys were capitalists also. 
<br>
Its a more complicated issue then you seem to acknowledge.  Perhaps you or 
<br>
Milt Friedman may make a decent case for harnessing capitalism to promote 
<br>
ethical behavior as a decent side-effect? But the blood doesn't wash out as 
<br>
Shakesphere said much more elloquently; a lot of evil has been done in the 
<br>
past. Slavery was capitalistic, albeit a hideously evil, form of it. I stand 
<br>
by my assetions, which might be clarified as &quot;making money is very nice, 
<br>
doing evil (we need to define this!) to accomplish it crosses the line&quot;
