</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A man hates his job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; One day he comes home and begins to drink...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He drinks till he passes out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He gets up in the middle of the night, and goes to

<em>&gt; &gt; back to bed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; When he wakes up in the morning, he looks out his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; window and see's hundreds of people laying there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The man kills himself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Q. What did the man do for a living?

</em><br>
<p>Ziana replied:
<br>
<em>&gt; Maybe he was a scientist developing some sort of bio/nano plague (maybe
</em><br>
for the military or something). He drank a bunch because he was depressed
<br>
about the people he was working on it for planning to use it, although maybe
<br>
like the atomic-bomb research people he was originally interested in doing
<br>
the research, but by this point he was against how it would be used but was
<br>
in too deep now. And he went into the bathroom in the middle of the night
<br>
because he had a dream that he had become infected with the disease, and he
<br>
was checking to see if the signs (of whatever form) were showing on him.
<br>
Reassured it was just a dream, he returns to bed. But then the next morning
<br>
it turns out the plague had been released in some way (either accidentally
<br>
or otherwise), and some activists against the research (bio, nano, whatever)
<br>
had discovered his role in developing the plague and had brought some of the
<br>
bodies of the dead there and piled them where he saw when he looked out of
<br>
his window (ei!
<br>
<em>&gt; ther hoping to infect him with the disease, or just in a
</em><br>
demonstration/protest sort of way).
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>How about this... he was involved in developing a nano-plague, and was
<br>
depressed about it. He came home and got drunk, because of his moral crisis.
<br>
This crisis had been going on for some time.
<br>
<p>There were various safeguards at the labs. Unfortunately, our hero had been
<br>
fairly sloppy recently, due to his generally low moral, and had been
<br>
infected with the plague. Fortunately, however, he was also carrying an
<br>
internal nano-anti-plague against the nano-plague, as were all the lab's
<br>
workers. Unfortunately, the anti-plague just locally neutralised the plague,
<br>
rather than eradicating it.
<br>
<p>Even more unfortunate, the plague was designed to travel in water, whilst
<br>
the anti-plague was designed to stay in a host body and not replicate/travel
<br>
outside.
<br>
<p>After a period of drunken stupor, our hero wakes up, goes to the bathroom,
<br>
does what it is natural for him to do (ie: urinates), flushes the toilet,
<br>
turns off the light, goes to bed.
<br>
<p>He wake up in the morning to find everyone dead; the entire water/sewage
<br>
infrastructure of the area is infested with deadly nano-plague. Presumably
<br>
the other guys from the lab are ok, but they're the only ones left. Also
<br>
perhaps there is a small subset of the populace with natural resistance to
<br>
the plague, who are also left alive.
<br>
<p>He kills himself, and the small remainder of humanity goes on to play out
<br>
Steven King's The Stand, to everyone's dismay (as it is a hopeless story).
<br>
<p>Did I forget to mention that he lives in a lighthouse?
