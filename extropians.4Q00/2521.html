<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Let's see... the Greens support equal redistribution of wealth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Theft and largess bestowed upon the thief's henchmen...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Read another one of my postings- I worded this one wrong...
</em><br>
<p>Rewording is irrelevant when it means the same thing. Telling people
<br>
what they can own and can't, what they can earn and can't, and
<br>
confiscating and redistributing the rest (evenly or unevenly) is nothing
<br>
but theft. You don't fool any of us by prettying up your words.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; an increase in localization and community self-reliance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Balkanization...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The end of corporate slavery.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, so you will be confiscating industrial assets from businesses and
<br>
giving them to worker cooperatives. I see. Seig Heil, comrade.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; fighting for equal civil rights,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Those that they let you keep, anyway...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Which ones would they take away, other than the right to destroy your
</em><br>
fellow
<br>
<em>&gt;man's standard of living and, perhaps, the right to carry firearms around?
</em><br>
<p>As a captured Commissar confessed to a friend of mine who was in
<br>
military intelligence in Korea, &quot;Once we got their guns, taking their
<br>
money was REAL easy.&quot;
<br>
<p>Free market economics is not the zero sum game you socialists seem to
<br>
think it is. You're mindsets are stuck in the middle ages. Get with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; better regulated international trade,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Protective and punitive tariffs...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The end to international labor abuses.
</em><br>
<p>I.E.: Protect overpaid union jobs here by forcing other countries to
<br>
price their labor to eliminate the competetiveness of products imported
<br>
into the US. Well, its funny how gunboat politics seems quite alright if
<br>
your intentions are in the right place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; the development of clean and sustainable sources of energy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Which also happen to be expensive and unreliable...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's better than destroying the planet with our coal and oil use, which
</em><br>
will
<br>
<em>&gt;run out in half a century anyway...
</em><br>
<p>Liar. Oil that is recoverable at today's market price we have in the
<br>
order of around 200 years worth. As the price escalates, more expensive
<br>
to recover reserves become commercially viable to recover. Stop thinking
<br>
with a stasist mindset.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; the promotion of mass transit and neighborhoods constructed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; for pedestrians instead of cars,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Via punishing taxes on automotive fuels...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have no beef with this one (of course, I'm a college student who
</em><br>
relies on
<br>
<em>&gt;public transportation, and for the three months out of the year that I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drive, I have a car that gets 36 MPG).  I think that a 10-20 cent gas tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be a very good idea.
</em><br>
<p>How about a tax to recover the public medical costs of accidents
<br>
involving unsafe micro-vehicles that sacrifice safety features and solid
<br>
engineering in order to save energy.
<br>
<p>over half of our current gas prices are already totally taxes. We don't
<br>
need more of your confiscation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; a woman's right to reproductive choice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; How kind of them to give her this one, after taking away so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; others...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Which others that I already don't think should be taken away?
</em><br>
<p>Her right to defend herself adequately against violent criminals that
<br>
have been released upon society by your liberal legal ideas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; the promotion of small scale organic agriculture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; over industrialized, chemical agriculture,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Expensive, bug infested food in short supply...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's better than dying of cancer, like I've seen several members of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;family go due to the agricultural toxins infesting the upper midwest.
</em><br>
<p>At what ages?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Native American sovereignty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; A noble goal about 100 years too late...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Better late than never.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, let them build as many casinos with mafia money as they want...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; and waste reduction programs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Ignoring, of course, the waste caused by gross interference with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; markets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We're talking about trash, not economics.
</em><br>
<p>Neither of which you seem to understand a bit of. Government regulation
<br>
causes excessive waste in both the public an private sectors. You would
<br>
not have so much waste from product packaging if it were not government
<br>
mandated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Nice dream- too bad the methods used tend to produce police states.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We already live our lives oppressed by corporate interests... what
</em><br>
would the
<br>
<em>&gt;difference be?
</em><br>
<p>A corporation cannot continue to survive if it shoots its customers.
