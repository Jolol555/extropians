<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It seems to me the most extropic people have either avoided marriage,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  tolerated it as a necessary evil, or abandoned it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I'm thinking of Socrates, Turing, Galileo, Oscar Wilde, Siddhartha, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  others.
</em><br>
<p>Socrates certainly did not avoid marriage, although perhaps he tolerated it
<br>
(a rather mean-spirited way of putting it):
<br>
<p>from Xenophon's Symposium: 
<br>
<p>Then Socrates: ...I see, the dancing-girl is standing ready; they are
<br>
handing her some hoops. ..
<br>
<p>Then Socrates: The girl's performance is one proof among a host of others,
<br>
sirs, that woman's nature
<br>
is nowise inferior to man's. All she lacks is strength and judgment; and
<br>
that should be an
<br>
encouragement to those of you who have wives, to teach them whatever you
<br>
would want them to
<br>
know. 
<br>
<p>Antisthenes rejoined: If that is your conclusion, Socrates, why do you not
<br>
tutor your own wife,
<br>
Xanthippe, one of the most difficult women of times past, present, or future? 
<br>
<p>===================
<br>
<p>Xanthippe has long been regarded as a shrew. This can be questioned.
<br>

<br>
<p>As for Galileo - in 1600, his lover  Marina Gamba gave birth to a
<br>
daughter,Virginia, later taking the name Maria Celeste. The next year
<br>
Marina has another girl, Livia,  later Arcangela. Later he has a son,
<br>
Vincenzio. In 1629, Galileo becomes a grandfather, when his daughter-in-law
<br>
Sestilia Bocchineri, has a boy given the name Galileo. Married or not, he
<br>
seems friom this history to be, in his way, a family oriented kinda fellow.
