He was brilliant as a inspirer and sharer of scientific knowledege. He was 
<br>
also big time into the Ganja and this at age 55-60! He was a big time 
<br>
schmuckeroo when it came time to face down the Soviets, when they wished to 
<br>
Glom West Asia and Western Europe--and glom it they would have, had not the 
<br>
West and Old Man Reagan showed them a fist, and the will to use it. Carl 
<br>
Sagan  was chicken ala Carl on the money for SDI, and basically viewed the 
<br>
world so pessimistically, that surrender was better then annihilation-well 
<br>
yeah! But people of a sneakier frame of mind could see that it wasn't exactly 
<br>
the sure destinty of humanity-at least at that point. I like Freeman Dysons' 
<br>
( a Strong Democratic Socialist) response to Carl's Nuclear Winter scenario, 
<br>
with his Nuclear Spring--using the same data.

<em>&gt; &gt;Sagan was showboating buffoon who was doing memetic programming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pretty strong words, Mike.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wonder if you've read his scientific papers, his popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works, seen his old Cosmos TV series, or met or worked with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fellow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes indeed, he had a particular agenda, which he promoted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various media.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He also was a well-respected scientist by his peers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (try typing his name in NASA ADS to get an idea of the volume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and breadth of his research)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He ran a solid research department at Cornell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His TV series inspired a whole generation of astronomers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And believe it or not, he was a nice man too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I certainly would not call him a showboating buffoon.
