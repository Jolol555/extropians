<p>I hope, for your sake, you never do.

</em><br>
<p>Books and movies are by far the best place for war.  However, if you
<br>
really want some &quot;authentic experiences&quot;, there are a number of little
<br>
wars all over the world.  You could just join the US military and hope you
<br>
get lucky, but there are lots of oportunities elsewere.  Everything from
<br>
American volunteers in Bosnia to narco-traffickers in Columbia.  You seem
<br>
fairly smart; the Legion Estranger would probably snap you up...they tend
<br>
to see quite a bit of action.  Hell, if you want the experience without
<br>
the messy business of actually killing anyone, or you've got flatfeet or
<br>
something, become a war correspondent or photographer.  I've met a number
<br>
of them...they even claim to be immortal (or at least act like it).  If
<br>
you are so keen on an adventure, what are you doing wasting your time on
<br>
this list? Go do it...it is still just as easy as when Byron did it.  Just
<br>
don't complain to me later....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are no revolutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left.  
</em><br>
<p>Haven't read this list very carefully, have you?  What do you think is
<br>
going on all around us now?  What do you think we mean when we say
<br>
(small S) &quot;singularity&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've never really loved or hated anyone.  
</em><br>
<p>To not have loved is sad, but I suspect will come with time.
<br>
Unfortunately, the same probably goes for hate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not sure if I'll even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get the priviledge of dying.  
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I would call it a priviledge.  From what I've seen of it, it
<br>
is pretty ugly...nothing like the movies.  And to not to put too fine a
<br>
point on the matter, any of my suggestions above could rapidly solve this
<br>
lack. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't feel like I'm even alive half the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time.  
</em><br>
<p>I sometimes feel that way, too.  I call it depression, and I've struggled
<br>
with it most my life.  But guess what?  It is an &quot;experience&quot;, too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If these are all so terrible, why do I long for them?
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps because you are young, and don't know any better?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And I appreciate your telling of them.  I'm afraid I don't have any stories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to tell.
</em><br>
<p>You will.  Believe me, you will.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But you wouldn't have the tales to tell without the philosophies that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created them.
</em><br>
<p>Oh yes I would.  I have many other tales, that I tell more often, that are
<br>
much happier.  The day I met my wife.  Being snowbound in Kentucky.  A
<br>
wild cross-country trip in an old MG.  My first skydiving jump.  Getting
<br>
lost in Rome.  My very silly honeymoon.  The time my dad almost set the
<br>
house on fire.  The time *I* almost set the house on fire.  One or two
<br>
world class practical jokes.  The huge bolide I saw.  Living aboard ship,
<br>
prospecting for oil.  A handful of books that shattered my world and
<br>
rebuilt it in an afternoon.  The story of my great-grandfather crossing
<br>
the Black Hills of South Dakota on one of the first wagon trains. A
<br>
certain teacher who made all the difference. 
<br>
<p>No &quot;philosophies&quot; needed.  No violence, or war, or revolution, no pain
<br>
that was not self inflicted.  I'm much fonder of these stories, these
<br>
memories. I intend to make a lot more of them.
<br>
<p>&quot;Mediated fantasies and simulations&quot; will come and seek you out...its a
<br>
lucrative business.  If you want &quot;authentic experiences&quot; you've got to go
<br>
out and find them.  It takes effort.  If you want to live, then *live*. 
<br>
Don't wait for history to make a life for you...you probably won't like
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You just don't know me.
</em><br>
<p>No I don't.  But I remember saying many of the same things, not all
<br>
that long ago, so perhaps I understand more than you think.
