</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ron h.

<p>I have challenged many in the past to come up with just those numbers. Not 
<br>
on this list, but in person.
<br>
<p>So far, no one has been able to point up a single proven instance of gun 
<br>
restrictions bringing a reduction in crime. There are incidents on record, 
<br>
however, that show how &quot;gun control&quot; or &quot;gun safety&quot; laws have resulted in 
<br>
death or injury to innocents who could not get to a gun to defend themselves.
<br>
<p>Every instance of rape or robbery on the street is an instance where 
<br>
concealed carry, for instance, might have prevented the crime.
<br>
<p>Recent news reports have shown gun incidents dropping for the last few 
<br>
years, especially in the accidental shooting category. This at the same 
<br>
time that gun ownership has increased. This could be a sign of better 
<br>
education among gun owners.
<br>
<p>I have no knowledge of any real study that ties crime or accident 
<br>
reductions to any particular law.
<br>
<p>Just reading the papers in the Chicago area reveals that crimes involving 
<br>
guns are not going away. You never hear of convictions for the gun, it is 
<br>
often dropped in a plea bargain for a &quot;juicier&quot; crime like robbery or 
<br>
murder. You NEVER hear of someone being prosecuted for Brady Law 
<br>
violations, or at a federal level, except for a very few gun dealers or 
<br>
manufacturers like Maadi-Griffin in Arizona recently, who the BATF nailed 
<br>
for selling perfectly legal .50-caliber single shot rifle kits. Or Waco, 
<br>
which was in essence a matter of an alleged  failure to pay a $200 transfer 
<br>
fee.
