[Had to add my dime to the recent foray into alternative
<br>
methods-of-expression.]
<br>
<p>Graft vs. Host Disease
<br>
<p>(Methods of Conveyance)
<br>
<p>It is an unfortunate state of affairs. We thought that by combining a cell
<br>
from each of those two hand-selected organisms, that we could hope for the
<br>
best possible outcome. Improvements, improvements. Surely, it was a step in
<br>
the right direction. One pluripotent cell and ohhh, look at the waste of it.
<br>
All those years of input, time consuming growth and development.
<br>
Experiences and energy. Perhaps we didn't add the right combination of
<br>
stimulatory growth factors at the optimal times and locations.Perhaps we
<br>
failed to incorporate the necessary inhibitory factors.
<br>
<p>Assess the experiment. The blood brain barrier appears to be an effective
<br>
addition. The bio-interface has good mobility options, even factoring in the
<br>
costs of mechanical degradation. Random fluctuations in motivational input
<br>
seems to maximize work potential.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, just when the organism has been primed for the next phase,
<br>
irreversible systemic organ failure overtakes the intricate repair program.
<br>
Consult Id about implementing zero-net oxidant gain with the next batch.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The boredom-stress continuum could use some tweaking as well. External and
<br>
internal coherence are highly desirable.The sensitivity of the organism to
<br>
environmental fluctuations and interactions with other similar organisms has
<br>
led to adverse outcomes. Amplify the relative weights accorded
<br>
self-perceptions and minimize or alter all external feedback parameters.
<br>
<p>Keep a close watch on any resulting schizophrenic tendencies. Make necessary
<br>
adjustments to the Kohonen network, balancing neuromodulator usage as
<br>
indicated.
<br>
<p>Innovative design specifications and tighter quality control should be given
<br>
greater emphasis in future applications.
