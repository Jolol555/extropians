How the Brain Knows What It Knows
<br>

<br>
scientists were given the description of a silicon mouse that could
<br>
understand the word &quot;one.&quot; Based on a thorough description of the mouse's
<br>
nervous system, the challenge was to figure out how the mouse did it. Dr.
<br>
Brody said Dr. Hopfield had discovered that something called synchronous
<br>
rhythm was the key to solving the puzzle, and they wanted to see if other
<br>
scientists would come to the same conclusion.
<br>
<p>Sights, sounds, smells, textures and other information flowing into the
<br>
brain arrive not all at once but over brief intervals of time, he explained.
<br>
For example, a spoken word may have several consonants and vowels that
<br>
unfold over a half second, and somehow the brain cells have to bridge this
<br>
gap.
<br>
<p>The brain does this by exploiting the fact that cells involved in
<br>
recognizing various aspects of the word produce identical firing patterns,
<br>
Dr. Hopfield said. Cells that fire with the same rhythm fall into the same
<br>
marching step, as the bits and pieces of the word are comprehended by the
<br>
brain. Meanwhile, cells that fire at slightly different rates are not
<br>
reinforced and fall out of step. This fundamental synchrony is crucial to
<br>
comprehension, he said.

&nbsp;I think I must add &quot;free will&quot; to the list of &quot;consciousness&quot; &quot;phlogiston&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;vitalism&quot; and &quot;mind&quot; as examples of useless hypotheses.
