<p><em>&gt; Our hypotheses are: 1.  that more women than men hold non-scientific

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  mathematics and science than women.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I know there have been studies supporting the 2nd hypothesis; I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  sure about the first.  Unanswered questions include: 1. If either of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  above hypotheses is true, what might be the explanation?  2. Would it be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  desirable to change the situation--eg. to target young girls for extra
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  training in scientific areas?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  An observation I made was that from birth boy and girl babies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  generally treated differently, one difference being that girl babies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  more closely protected.  I wondered if this early protection might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  prevent girls from developing an understanding of the way things work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (eg. if a little girl isn't allowed to play on the see-saw she'd lack an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  early grasp of the concept that Work= Force x Distance) .

<p>[[ WARNING: The following contains gross generalities and completely 
<br>
groundless theorizing ]]
<br>
<p>Here's a pet theory of mine: Many women's &quot;ballistic sense&quot; is much less well 
<br>
developed than men's because of less early simple training in catching and 
<br>
throwing at very young ages.  Basic catching/throwing play and training may 
<br>
provide a stronger base for general space and material-dynamics concepts, 
<br>
which in turn support both a lot of athletic activity AND intuitive grasp of 
<br>
spatial and spatio-temporal relationships that provide a framework for higher 
<br>
mathematics.
<br>
<p>It would be nice to do a broad-based study of the kind of early childhood 
<br>
play/training boys and girls receive and later outcomes, with a special focus 
<br>
on the kids that receive non-standard play training.
