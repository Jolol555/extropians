<p>This first point of yours is plainly false. See the Law Merchant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And as attractive as the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; contracts might seem, real-existing capitalism, dominated by various kinds
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; thugs, liberal democratic polities, and all the other forces of modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politics - real capitalists have always used the coercive aparatus of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; very few capitalists have ever been consistent libertarians.
</em><br>
<p>As opposed to what? Capitalism exists separate and apart from government, while
<br>
your socialism absolutely requires government monopoly on force to compel
<br>
compliance by members of society with the socialist policies: to confiscate
<br>
property, to enforce equitable distribution, and to compel the division of
<br>
labor. Whereas totally voluntary communal organizations have always existed,
<br>
unimpeded (indeed, they are frequently assisted by capitalists), within free and
<br>
open capitalist oriented societies, no socialist society has ever allowed
<br>
voluntary capitalist organizations to exist unimpeded within them (while
<br>
socialist will almost never seek to improve a capitalists business). This
<br>
primary delineation between what I advocate and what you advocate puts the lie
<br>
to your claims.
