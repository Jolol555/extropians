<p>&lt;&lt; This assumes that it was the job or the duty of the U.S. to cause the
<br>
&nbsp;collapse of the Soviet system.  Though I agree that the result was
<br>
&nbsp;beneficial, I question the obligation of U.S. citizens to pay whatever
<br>
&nbsp;cost was required to get that result.  I'll still be paying down that
<br>
&nbsp;debt with my income taxes for years.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;As to the other experimental benefits, if we were interested in
<br>
&nbsp;producing good science why not directly subsidize it?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;I think the government owes it to its citizens to restrict its defense
<br>
&nbsp;expenditures to defense, and leave behind the imperial pretension &gt;&gt;
<br>
Ignoring the ganja issue for the nonce. I was in favor of getting the Soviets 
<br>
to back-off. In Backing-off they realized there was no big bad outsider to 
<br>
unite them so they collpased. An oversimplification I agree. If because of 
<br>
your libertarian principles, you find this un-useful, so be it. It's one of 
<br>
those things that are purely ideological, and I am not geared for those 
<br>
arguments. Not my cup of borsht.
<br>
Respectfully, Yours, Comrade Spudnik
