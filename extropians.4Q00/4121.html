<p><p>Part of what you say is true.  I think that the general lack of 
<br>
turnout from poorer communities has (in part) led to the decline of 
<br>
many of this country's social programs in recent years.
<br>
<p>I looked around for voting stats broken down by income levels, but 
<br>
turned up nothing.  Has anyone tried to use the Ferret? 
<br>
<a href="http://ferret.bls.census.gov/cgi-bin/ferret">http://ferret.bls.census.gov/cgi-bin/ferret</a>
<br>
<p>However, there are still voting blocks, like black voters who 
<br>
certainly have stuck with the Democratic party.  Since the Democratic 
<br>
party offers benefits to black voters besides just social programs, 
<br>
it's hard to distinguish whether or not the social programs alone are 
<br>
getting them actual votes.
<br>
<p>Does it really matter, though?  If a political party's perception is 
<br>
that they need to give out social programs to gain a certain block's 
<br>
vote, then they're going to spend the taxpayers' money that way... 
<br>
damage done.
<br>
<p>You also can't simply look at social programs being only for the 
<br>
&quot;underclass&quot;, like welfare.  Tax funded social programs exist in many 
<br>
forms for voters of many income levels, and new ones are popping up 
<br>
all the time:  unemployment insurance, National Healthcare, farm 
<br>
subsidies, publicly funded day care, etc.
<br>
<p>As an additional note - the elderly, who were promised so much in 
<br>
social programs this last election in terms of medicare, social 
<br>
security, and prescription drug benefits, certainly do vote. 
<br>

<br>
<p>With Baby Boomers well on their way to being elderly, you'll see 
<br>
politicians offering them social programs out the wazoo in coming 
<br>
years.
<br>
<p>Regards,
