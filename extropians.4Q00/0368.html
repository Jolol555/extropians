<p>It would help to incrementally incorporate more and more AI into our
<br>
work and world.  To do this peaceably you need to insure that people get
<br>
taken care of, have a way to stay sanely occupied and to have their
<br>
needs met, regardless of the growing number of more and more
<br>
sophisticated tasks done by AI/robotics.  You need to show net benefits
<br>
to all, not just to a few. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If our contingency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies are not adequate at the time AI is created, put hard resource
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constraints on the AI until contingencies are in place.  A constrained AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is still extraordinarly useful, even if operating at below its potential.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The very fact that a demonstrable AI technology exists (coupled with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; early technology development capabilities of said AI) should allow one to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly access and/or leverage enough financial resources to start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working on a comprehensive program of getting people off of our orbiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rock and hopefully outside of our local neighborhood.  I would prefer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be observing from a very safe distance before unleashing an unconstrained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI upon the planet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I would prefer that we took the many thousands of small steps necessary
<br>
before every arriving at what is feared (labeled here &quot;an unconstrained
<br>
AI&quot;) and had those steps shown to be of net benefit to all and safe
<br>
enough for the next step.  AI as a field has been languishing since its
<br>
overhype in the 80s and 90s.  This needs to end.
