Hunting is not now and never has been the issue.
<br>
<p>If the framers of the Constitution meant one thing when they said &quot;the
<br>
people&quot; in the 2nd Amendment, and another thing when they said &quot;the
<br>
people&quot; everywhere else, they were on crack.
<br>
<p>And I don't think they were. The doctrine of selective incorporation was
<br>
a political maneuver by the Supremes. Regardless of your mindreading
<br>
claims re the NRA, whom I will neither defend nor attack, Emerson or
<br>
another couple of cases currently working will probably make it to the
<br>
Supreme Court some time in the next two years; we'll see what they say,
<br>
or if they deny cert., and we'll see what happens after that.

<em>&gt; The 2nd amendment was meant to keep 'well-regulated militias' armed, to protect the states charged with regulating them against the encroachment of federal power, a protection that was proven useless by the Civil war.  
</em><br>
<p>Mr. Dees, kindly show me where the word &quot;State&quot; appears in the Second
<br>
Amendment. Or show me where the term &quot;well regulated&quot; explicitly says
<br>
where the &quot;regulation&quot; comes from. Or show me that the writings of the
<br>
time said &quot;Militia[s] regulated by the State[s]&quot; anywhere in the
<br>
Federalist or Anti-Federalist Papers. It's an explanatory clause, not a
<br>
restrictive one. Even Laurence Tribe, the noted Constitutional scholar,
<br>
now says something like &quot;the prevailing [sic] opinion that the right to
<br>
bear arms is only a collective right 'may have been simplistic.'&quot; Gee,
<br>
no shit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Stupid laws like the &quot;assault weapon&quot; ban are just incremental gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;prohibition - especially if the definition of &quot;assault weapon&quot; continues to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;mutate, like in California.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, what mutated were the guns.  The manufacturers produced cosmetically altered copycat versions specifically designed to circumvent the ban while retaining the desired rapid-fire characteristics, and the law was amended to cover them.
</em><br>
<p>Partly true; in some cases they just changed the names stamped or forged
<br>
into the receivers. But in fact, the criteria were and are still stupid.
<br>
I believe the Second Amendment specifically protects military pattern
<br>
weapons in the hands of the same &quot;the people&quot; that appears everywhere
<br>
else in the Constitution, distinct from &quot;the States&quot; clearly marked out
<br>
elsewhere, as indicated in the actual &quot;hot potato&quot; _Miller_ Supreme
<br>
Court case that HCI and others love to misinterpret. Have you read that,
<br>
by the way? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not subscribe to the slippery slope domino theory, and would not support such action.  I do believe that we should all be willing to take responsible measures to keep military-style semiautomatic rifles from flooding the civilian market, while preserving the right of sane and law-abiding adults to purchase shotguns, long guns designed for hunting, and handguns designed for home protection.
</em><br>
<p>Very big of you. But handguns are not designed for home protection, they
<br>
are designed to be compact and easily portable. So I expect you'll be
<br>
banning them any day now, right?
<br>
<p>Let me be clear: I don't think crazies or bad people should have an easy
<br>
time hurting others. 
<br>
I am also aware that it's a common human practice to marginalize people
<br>
by calling them crazy and/or bad. I believe there were lives and
<br>
property saved by the presence of obvious military pattern weapons in
<br>
the hands of the law-abiding in the distant and recent past, and I see
<br>
no reason to believe that the near future will be better served by their
<br>
absence.
<br>
<p>Call me crazy. :)
<br>
<p>MMB
<br>
<p>&quot;Absolute truth?  What's that?&quot;
<br>
&quot;It's a five-to-four decision of the Supreme Court.&quot;
