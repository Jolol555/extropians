A few weeks ago Scerir pointed to: <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/cond-mat?0002075">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/cond-mat?0002075</a>.
<br>
This paper (published, oddly enough, in a &quot;condensed matter&quot; archive)
<br>
extrapolates population and financial trends forward and comes to an
<br>
apparent singularity in the 2050-2060 time frame.
<br>
<p>The paper is similar in spirit to Robin's <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/longgrow.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/longgrow.html</a>,
<br>
which it references.  They use a different model, essentially a power
<br>
law acceleration in the growth rate, which produces a singularity.
<br>
This is then modified with a periodic term and it seems to fit their
<br>
data reasonably well.  By that time though there are so many parameters
<br>
to tweak that the fit isn't all that hard to achieve.  I don't know
<br>
how the fit and/or parameter counts compare with Robin's model.
<br>
<p>The curious thing about the paper is the conclusion.  After going
<br>
through equation after equation, graph after graph showing infinite
<br>
economic output and population in the mid 21st century, they now proceed
<br>
to interpret their results.  There are two scenarios presented: either
<br>
the human race essentially wipes itself out through ecological disaster,
<br>
or it manages to limit its population growth and live in harmony with
<br>
the earth, a &quot;balanced symbiosis with nature.&quot;  &quot;Perhaps what is needed
<br>
to avoid the finite-time singularity is a massive transfer of resources
<br>
from developed to developing countries.&quot;
<br>
<p>The seem to be utterly ignoring their models as offering any real insight
<br>
into the possibility that economic output could rise to unheard of levels
<br>
in the next few decades.  After all the charts and equations pointing
<br>
towards something incredible happening, they continue to see the future
<br>
in conventional terms.  What a letdown.
