<p>I'd like to second Robert's earlier suggestion of destroying

the whole self-replicating mess that is Nature and replacing

it with something safer.  I want to put up some posters of

various hideous skin eating diseases at work with the words
<br>
&quot;Biodiversity in Action&quot; printed on them.

<br>
