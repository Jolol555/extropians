<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
K Cells engineered to release insulin in response to glucose
<br>
<p>Diabetes is caused by an inability of the pancreas to produce insulin
<br>
(type 1) or an inability to properly utilize insulin (type 2).  Type 1
<br>
diabetes requires the use of insulin, and many type 2 diabetics need
<br>
insulin injections as well.  Because it is difficult for patients who need
<br>
insulin injections to attain ideal glucose levels they remain at risk for
<br>
such serious conditions cardiovascular disease, blindness and kidney
<br>
disease.  Recent  research has explored the possibility of genetic
<br>
engineering of cells to release insulin, but the insulin release is not
<br>
glucose dependent as is that of a healthy pancreas, the timing of insulin
<br>
release being of vital importance for the best glucose regulation.  In an
<br>
article published in the December 8 issue of Science, researchers
<br>
engineered K cells in the digestive tracts of mice to release insulin in
<br>
response to glucose.   K cells are located in the stomach, duodenum and
<br>
jejunum.  They secrete a hormone, GIP, which potentiates insulin release
<br>
after eating.  Because these cells are sensitive to glucose, they were
<br>
chosen for the experiment in which  mouse embryos were engineered so that
<br>
their K cells expressed human insulin.  The transgenic mice and their
<br>
controls were then given a toxin to destroy the insulin-producing cells of
<br>
the pancreas.  Control animals developed fasting high blood glucose and
<br>
glucose in their urine, both signs of diabetes, whereas the genetically
<br>
engineered mice did not show either of these signs and continued to gain
<br>
weight normally.  When challenged with an oral glucose load, the control
<br>
mice experienced high levels of blood glucose, while the transgenic mice
<br>
had normal glucose levels and were able to rapidly metabolize the glucose
<br>
in the same manner as control mice who had functioning pancreases.  The
<br>
researchers concluded that insulin production from K cells in the gut may
<br>
correct diabetes and that the identification of a cell target for insulin
<br>
production in the body is an important step toward gene therapy for
<br>
diabetes.
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
New treatment for diabetic macular edema
<br>
<p>Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness between the ages of twenty and
<br>
seventy-four.   Diabetic macular edema, or DME occurs when the retinal
<br>
blood vessels of diabetic patients deteriorate, causing leakage.   Of the
<br>
nations 10.3 million diabetics, half a million have DME.  Forty percent of
<br>
all diabetics develop DME with 75,000 new cases diagnosed each year.
<br>
<p>University of Kentucky College of Medicine Department of Opthalmology has
<br>
helped develop a new treatment for DME that involves a simple surgical
<br>
procedure which implants a device that provides sustained release of the
<br>
drug fluocinolone acetonide into the back of the eye.  Fluocinolone
<br>
acetonide is an anti-inflammatory steroid that inhibits the growth of
<br>
damaged blood vessels while it controls inflammation.  The implant
<br>
delivers consistent levels of the drug for up to three years.  This limits
<br>
whole-body exposure to the medication, reduces the necessary dose and the
<br>
the need for frequent drug treatments.
<br>
<p>Principle investigator P. Andrew Pearson, M.D., assistant professor,
<br>
Department of Ophthalmology, UK College of Medicine commented, &quot;This
<br>
technology may offer the opportunity to treat DME with a drug instead of
<br>
an invasive procedure.  This may offer an effective method to improve the
<br>
sight of patients afflicted with this terrible disease.&quot;
<br>
<p>Five patients in a clinical study lead by Pearson received the implant in
<br>
one eye while the other eye was left untreated.  All patients experienced
<br>
resolution of their macular edema in the eye that was treated and had
<br>
improved visual acuity after nine months.  The untreated eyes remained
<br>
unchanged.  Dr Pearson stated, &quot;The results of this study are encouraging,
<br>
especially because these patients had failed standard treatment, making
<br>
their cases very difficult to treat.&quot;
<br>
<p>The technology combined with other drugs is also is being studied to treat
<br>
age-related macular degeneration, and uveitis, a severe intraocular
<br>
inflammation, and is currently utilized in the treatment of CMV retinitis.

<br>
<p>Type 1 diabetics benefit from vitamin E
<br>
<p>A randomized double-blind study reported in November's American Journal of
<br>
Clinical Nutrition demonstrated that type 1 diabetics taking vitamin E had
<br>
much less peroxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low
<br>
density lipoprotein (VLDL). The findings are meaningful in light of the
<br>
increased cardiovascular disease experienced by diabetics, caused in part
<br>
by oxidation of LDL cholesterol. Although diabetics do not have lower
<br>
blood levels of vitamin E than normal individuals, it is believed that
<br>
vitamin E will benefit this group through its antioxidant ability.
<br>
<p>Forty four patients were divided into two groups, one receiving 250 iu
<br>
vitamin E three times per day for one year, and the second group receiving
<br>
a placebo for six months followed by 250 iu vitamin E three times per day
<br>
for six months. Patients serum vitamin E levels, LDL and VLDL oxidation,
<br>
and other values such as serum lipids, were monitored at the begininng at
<br>
the study and every three months for one year. In the group receiving
<br>
vitamin E, vitamin E levels rose after three months, but did not
<br>
thereafter, showing that the transport capacity of vitamin E in serum was
<br>
saturated by three months of supplementation. Similar results were seen in
<br>
the second group after beginning their vitamin E supplementation. After
<br>
the conclusion of the study, vitamin E levels returned to their initial
<br>
values.
<br>
<p>In both groups, the oxidation of LDL and VLDL cholesterol was
<br>
significantly decreased after three months of vitamin E supplementation.
<br>
In contrast, the second group did not experience this decrease during the
<br>
period in which they received the placebo. The study's authors emphasize
<br>
that vitamin E's antiperoxidative effect in this study was not due to
<br>
correction of a deficiency, as its effect was not related to initial serum
<br>
concentrations, nor was it related to a change in lipid levels.
<br>
<p>The authors recommend that type 1 diabetics consider life-long
<br>
supplementation with vitamin E.

<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Diabetes
<br>
<p>Diabetes has two primary forms, as well as some minor, transient ones.
<br>
<p>Type I diabetes was once called juvenile diabetes because it commonly
<br>
occurs in younger patients. It is considered an autoimmune disease and
<br>
results when the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells of
<br>
the pancreas, destroying them. The result is a pancreas that produces
<br>
little or no insulin. The exact cause of the attack on the beta cells is
<br>
not known, but both genetic and viral factors are believed to be involved.
<br>
<p>A person with Type I diabetes requires exogenous insulin (insulin from an
<br>
outside source) to sustain life. This insulin must be injected daily, and
<br>
often several times a day. Originally, insulin was obtained from pigs and
<br>
cows, though today's purified forms are of recombinant DNA origin. Type I
<br>
patients constitute only about 10% of all diabetics, but they often find
<br>
the condition to be devastating in its impact, in both short-and long-term
<br>
damage. There are currently several experiments in progress involving the
<br>
prevention of Type I diabetes in those who have genetic predisposition to
<br>
the disorder with beta cell antibodies present. The National Coordinating
<br>
Center (800) 425-8361 has a list of screening sites around the country, in
<br>
case you, or people you know, have an interest in participating.
<br>
<p>Type II is the most common form of diabetes, affecting approximately 15
<br>
million people in this country alone. There may be an equal number of
<br>
as-yet-undiagnosed Type II diabetics, because of the often subtle early
<br>
signs of the disorder. It has been called adult onset diabetes because it
<br>
commonly occurs after age 40, most often in the middle 50's and later. In
<br>
the great majority of cases, the Type II diabetic is overweight, putting
<br>
additional demands on an aging organ system.
<br>
Type II patients usually produce insulin, but for some reason (either
<br>
insufficient production or insulin resistance by the cells) their bodies
<br>
are unable to process glucose efficiently. The resulting condition is
<br>
similar to that of Type I: an excess of glucose in the blood and the lack
<br>
of fuel for the cells. Type II may have varying effects in different
<br>
people. The extreme levels of high blood sugar found in Type I are not as
<br>
prevalent in Type II patients, and the short-term dangers are not as
<br>
acute. However, unchecked or poorly controlled Type II will produce
<br>
long-term damage similar to that found in Type I. Many Type II diabetics
<br>
eventually take insulin because their disorder cannot be controlled
<br>
without it.
<br>
<p>Gestational Diabetes: Severe environmental and situational stressors, such
<br>
as pregnancy, may produce high levels of blood sugar. This is similar to
<br>
the effects of stress on other organ systems.
<br>
<p>Oxidative damage plays critical roles in the complications of diabetes,
<br>
including being part of the glycosylation process. Here are the most
<br>
important antioxidants used to combat this oxidative stress:
<br>
<p>Alpha-lipoic acid (aLA), also known as thioctic acid. Alpha-lipoic acid
<br>
has also been shown to be useful in the maintenance of neural health
<br>
(Garrett, 1997). It is suggested that vitamin B12 in the form of
<br>
methyl-cobalamin be taken concurrently since aLA may cause B12 depletion.
<br>
<p>Proanthocyanidins (grape seed/skin extract. These may be the most
<br>
concentrated natural antioxidants available. They also inhibit a dangerous
<br>
enzyme known as COX-2 that interferes with the body's levels of a
<br>
beneficial substance called prostacyclin.

<br>
<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Super Alpha Lipoic Acid
<br>
<p>Alpha Lipoic Acid is known by a variety of names including thioctic acid,
<br>
1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid, 1,2-dithiolane-3-valeric acid, and
<br>
6,8-thioctic acid. Alpha lipoic acid functions as a co-factor for energy
<br>
production as lipomide and is also called lipoate when functioning in this
<br>
manner.
<br>
<p>Alpha lipoic acid not only has potent antioxidant action in virtually all
<br>
the tissues of the body, but also is a cofactor for some of the key
<br>
enzymes (alpha keto acid dehydrogenases) involved in generating energy
<br>
from food and oxygen in mitochondria.

<br>
<p>Methylcobalamin
<br>
<p>Methylcobalamin is the neurologically active form of vitamin B12. The
<br>
liver does not convert cyanocobalamin, the commonly available form of
<br>
vitamin B12, into adequate amounts of methylcobalamin, which the body uses
<br>
to treat or correct neurological defects. Animal studies have shown that
<br>
high doses of methylcobalalmin are effective in neuron regeneration and
<br>
that there is no known toxicity at these doses.

<p>DECEMBER LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE NOW ONLINE
<br>
&quot;The Diabetes Epidemic&quot; by Angela Pirisi
<br>
<p>According to new research published by the Centers for Disease Control and
<br>
Prevention (CDC), the burden of diabetes has been growing at a disturbing
<br>
rate over the past decade.(1) The recent data shows that diabetes rose by
<br>
33% between 1990 and 1998 among the US population nationally. The disease
<br>
incidence rose by 70% among people in their 30s over the same period, by
<br>
40% among 40-49 year olds, and by 31% among those age 50-59, and about 13%
<br>
of those 60-plus had the disease. Add to these figures the fact that about
<br>
800,000 new cases crop up each year, and it's fair to say that diabetes is
<br>
spiraling out of control.
<br>
<p>The recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention figures paint a
<br>
picture that gives Americans cause for despair. At the same time, the new
<br>
data gives those with a family history of diabetes, a poor diet, and/or a
<br>
sedentary lifestyle a strong wake-up call that's as subtle as a blow to
<br>
the head. The most disconcerting part of the latest information is that
<br>
diabetes is no longer a disease reserved for an aging population that
<br>
inherently suffers a slowing down of metabolism and lower glucose
<br>
tolerance. Diabetes' victims are getting younger, lending much more time
<br>
for the disease to ripen to the point of presenting complications by the
<br>
time middle age rolls around.
