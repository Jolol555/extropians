<p><em>&gt; It seems to me there are two ways to look at it.  One is to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative (for an Extropian) and to say that germ line engineering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is new, it is unpredictable in its consequences, and so we should only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow or support changes which are clearly safe, along the lines Anders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposes.
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; How much worse is germ line engineering than moving to a land where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't even know if your children will be able to survive?  And where,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in many historical cases, children did not survive?  Should we condemn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who took chances in the past?  Or don't we applaud their courage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and daring?
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, so if neobioconservatives hardwire their children for a &quot;natural&quot;
<br>
lifespan and add in some genetic diseases to give them a taste of the
<br>
human condition, we should applaud it? After all, things like that
<br>
will increase the range of human variation, and it may turn out that
<br>
it is actually a good idea as suggested by one of the futures
<br>
sf-stories in Nature, where a massive epidemic wiped out everybody
<br>
without Tay Sachs-genes). 
<br>
<p>Taking risks is necessary, but taking unnecessary risks is
<br>
irrational. The same goes for genetic modifications; I really doubt
<br>
many parents would select highly risky treatments for their
<br>
children-to-be. That is not really the issue here, but how to handle
<br>
the fact that if parents select genes they might create initial
<br>
conditions that are adverse to the person that later develops. Should
<br>
there exist some form of feedback or compensation system so that
<br>
children can express their rights once they have become persons? It is
<br>
not an issue of banning certain forms of radical changes, but rather
<br>
making parents aware of the different potential costs of different
<br>
changes.
