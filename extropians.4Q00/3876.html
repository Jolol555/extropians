<em>&gt; I could do some research, but off the top of my head there was a case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; across the river in White River Junction, VT just a couple months ago
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where a black police officer was called n_____ by a drunk woman he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrested for D&amp;D. At the station he also pressed charges for a hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime, and won in court over her innocent plea. The woman insisted she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never used such language when sober and did not conciously intend to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that epithet.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds fair enough to me. Drugs/alcohol shouldn't get you out of social
<br>
responsibility, especially when voluntarily self administered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given that drugs like alcohol act to suppress the ego and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow the id more liberties (i.e. reduces inhibitions) this is as close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a thought crime as I think it is possible to go.
</em><br>
<p>id? Isn't that a games development company? Why are you spouting Freud on
<br>
the cusp of the 21st century?
<br>
<p>Really, it's not a thought crime at all. She really said it, the real
<br>
person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Its tantamount to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting a right wing republican under the influence of sodium pentathol
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and asking them if they'd like to off Pres. Clinton if given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity, then charging them with violation of federal law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If the right wing republican took sodium pentathol of his/her own accord,
<br>
then wandered up to a policeman and told them that he/she would like to kill
<br>
the President, the analogy would be more accurate.
