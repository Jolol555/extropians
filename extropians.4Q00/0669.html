<em>&gt; &gt;I just heard this news item while driving, but missed the name of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the governor (I think it was a governor) proposing the idea. I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hoping someone can fill in the details. The governor of whichever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;state was seriously proposing to deal with the problem of possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;mistakes in administering the death penalty by putting those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;executed into cryonic suspension. According to the report, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;governor was completely serious and simply &quot;thinking outside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;box&quot; (his words).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I'd *really* like to find out who he is and in which state, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;well as monitor the responses. Whether you are for or against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;death penalty, as administered by the government, I think this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a positive thing--it sends the message that an &quot;official&quot; sees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cryonic suspension as holding out real hope.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a death penalty advocate, I would be against any attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryonically suspend anyone to whom the death penalty has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administered.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know if a centralized government so far removed from its
<br>
citizenry should be trusted with such a serious decision, but 
<br>
maybe I'm just being a bleeding heart Libertarian again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The death penalty should be &quot;final death&quot; as covered in Jim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Halperins &quot;The first Immortal&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since it is final, it should only be administered when there is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little or no doubt.
</em><br>
<p>...but we all know that we don't live in a perfect world and the
<br>
state will go right on killing people whenever it feels like it until
<br>
the people finally kill the state or the state dies of natural causes.
<br>
So, for the here and now, it would be very useful politically to be
<br>
able to freeze death-row inmates. It would bring cryonics squarely into
<br>
the spotlight. I just hope cryonics is ready.  On the technical side,
<br>
this should hasten the first cryonic revivals because those doing the
<br>
reviving will only have to worry about the revival, not about reversing
<br>
whatever problem caused death in the first place.
<br>
<p>Of course, I'm beginning to suspect this is a moot point, since nobody
<br>
has yet been able to find a reference to this. I mean, what Max heard on
<br>
the radio could easily have been the plot of some science fiction book
<br>
getting retold or something.
