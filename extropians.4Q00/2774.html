<p><em>&gt;New information... exercise program modified accordingly.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;What I want, actually, is to *now* build a reasonably healthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physique that will *later* be easily maintainable (30 minutes 3
</em><br>
<em>&gt;times per week, or whatever) and that won't vanish in a flash if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I stop exercising for a week.  I'm guessing that means maximize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;muscle growth now with 8-10 reps per set (which is what I have now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;started doing), then switch to 15 reps per set when I think it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time to start getting ready for the transition to &quot;maintenance&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Right?
</em><br>
<p>Lifting heavy weights with 4-6 reps will build size quickly,
<br>
lifting light weights with 12 or more reps will build more
<br>
endurance. Note that you are exercising different muscle fibers
<br>
with each of these (slow/fast twitch). I find moderate to heavy
<br>
weights, 10-12 reps, is a good compromise. To build mass you'll
<br>
need at least three workouts a week. Once you get to the size you
<br>
want you can maintain with as little as one workout (weights) a
<br>
week. You should of course continue with cardiovascular work at
<br>
least 30 minutes 3 times a week. Note that if you break up the
<br>
cardio into 3 ten minutes sessions you still get 95% of the effect
<br>
according to recent tests.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Actually, I'm currently trying to keep in the range of about 1250
</em><br>
<em>&gt;calories per day, and have already gone from over 220 pounds to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;190.  Is it reasonable to try and build muscle and lose fat at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same time, or is it just outright impossible?  I got the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impression it was reasonable.
</em><br>
<p>If you eat too few calories (you are) your body will start
<br>
consuming its own hard won nuscle tissue. You especially want to
<br>
get enough protein. The trick is to continue to eat healthy, but
<br>
cut out the junk, especially fast carbo's (basically anything with
<br>
white sugar/flour).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;What worries me, at the moment, is that whenever I miss two days
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of exercise, I seem to drop two pounds.  Does this have something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to do with water retention or is it &quot;easy come, easy go&quot; muscle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mass?
</em><br>
<p>You're eating too few calories to be building mass. It's probably
<br>
partly water, but it is possibly also your body consuming extra
<br>
calories. There is an order to which the body consumes calories,
<br>
alcohol is first, carbos, then protein, fat is last. :(
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(Incidentally, no, I'm not taking any anti-oxidants.  While
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ordinarily a fan of not setting yourself up for a catastrophe if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Singularity happens later than expected, a 21-year-old taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anti-oxidants would be going much too far.  Unless my impressions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are mistaken and anti-oxidants have immediate health benefits?)
</em><br>
<p>Anti-oxidants have immediate benefits. You want to prevent damage
<br>
to already healthy systems. You don't have to get crazy with
<br>
supplements. Take a very good multivitamin, augment it with some
<br>
extra C (1000mg a day, I take 2000) 400 I.U of E, and make sure you
<br>
get at least 400mcg of folate (especially female extropians).
<br>
<p>The Life Extension Foundations basic supplement (with the booster)
<br>
is an excellent protocol.
<br>
<p><p>By the way, thanks for the file (navidad.exe).
