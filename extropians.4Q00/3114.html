<em>&gt; Hi Michael,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many thanks for your comments on my review of Broderick's excellent book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerning immortality etc. I feel I should respond to one or two of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticism of me however.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  You seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assume that the wisdom acquired in old age is a consequence of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individual slowly rotting away, and in coming to terms with one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mortality, rather than as a consequence of the accumulation of one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; past experience actually LIVING life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't assume this at all. The criticism I made was merely that Broderick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had not explored enough the psychological and spiritual dimensions of Old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Age. From a Developmetal Psychology perspective the book is sadly lacking -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the more so since so much of what is written is groudbreaking and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prophetic.  Likewise, my thoughts on the topic of old age, immortality etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were not covered to any depth in my review of Broderick's book. Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption that I equate the wisdom of old age only with suffering is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact incorrect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hence:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While there is something to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; said for confronting one's mortality, the rot of old age does not result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in wisdom, its simply a pain, an impediment, and a source of suffering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that could and should be avoided. Humanists claim to seek to alleviate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suffering in this world, yet they refuse to admit that the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; amount of suffering is from old age. If you claim that wisdom results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from this suffering, then you cannot conversely claim that other sources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of suffering, like child abuse, scholastic, military, gender, religious,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and racial/ethnic hazing and discrimination, police torture and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; imprisonment of criminals, are not all character building activities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that should also be accepted in our all too human world. By opposing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such suffering, you are thus opposed to creating greater wisdom in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world. As this reducto ad absurdum demonstrates, the logic of old age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; related
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suffering producing wisdom is false, or else your whole worldview is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; false. Wisdom comes from experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The peculiar circumstances of late Capitalism's pathologies (as listed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above in your letter) are in no way synonmous with the complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychospiritual, psychosocial and physical changes that come with pre-'Old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Age'. Your logical error is apparently to see all suffering as the same. To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equate old age for example, with child abuse, racism etc. is to mix
</em><br>
<em>&gt; categories to an almost absurd degree and thus to trivialise what is at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue with partisan rhetoric (I assume you're on Damia's side in all this -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct me if I'm wrong).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * You comments are nevertheless very interesting and have made me think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further about the psychospiritual issues/changes etc. which come with old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age  ... though I'm not keen on living for 4,000 years ... just yet. Maybe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, I will eat my words once I reach my 60s ... indeed the old knee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; joints creak a fair bit these days as a 36 year old ... and I forget
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's names a fair bit these days &lt;grins&gt;!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regards,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ian Irvine
