<br>
Subject: 137: Sheer blank-minded stupidity
<br>
<p>Okay, I'm sorry, but Gematria is not Extropic, it is drooling, empty-headed
<br>
rationalization.  Gematria is on the same level of sheer blank-minded
<br>
stupidity as astrology.
<br>
<p>____
<br>
I find being blank-minded very refreshing sometimes.
<br>
Have you ever been to Nirvana?
<br>
<p>Redefine astrology into something you can comprehend.
<br>
Time affects life.
<br>
Solar flares come every 11 years and you can bet people will be cranky.
<br>
Day and night and their amounts of light
<br>
have effects on neurotransmitter production.
<br>
Gravity affects life.
<br>
Low tide makes me lazy as it requires more strength.
<br>
People of different races
<br>
are more likely to be born at different times of year.
<br>
I was concieved during the winter and have many biological traits
<br>
associated with winter survivablity: thin lips, light skin, etc.
<br>
Bio traits affect mental traits: Neurotransmitter sensitivity, etc.
<br>
Astrology is real.
<br>
<p>Gematria teaches people to think on many levels.
<br>
It connects neurons that may otherwise never come into contact
<br>
thus allowing for novel thought.
<br>
It is also a method of encoding secrets.
<br>
Jibberish is not jibberish if you know what it means.
<br>
Anything can be extropic if you know how to use it.
<br>
____
<br>
<p>If you start trying to be tolerant of it, it
<br>
indicates that you have become too open-minded and your brains are now
<br>
starting to fall out.
<br>
<p>There is a place for mysticism in embryo Extropians.  I myself dabbled in
<br>
mysticism up until the age of fourteen or fifteen or so.  However, I expect
<br>
mysticism in Those For Whom There Is Still Hope to take the form of
<br>
fascination with psychic powers, the teleology of the Universe, exotic
<br>
physical theories, mystical interpretations of qualia, reconciliation of
<br>
ultratech futures in terms of religious prophecies, and so on.  Taking
<br>
astrology or Gematria seriously indicates that you are a flat-out idiot.
<br>
<p>___
<br>
I take everything with a grain of salt.
<br>
Most people are idiots and so are most astrologers,
<br>
but please, don't throw insults.
<br>
___
<br>
<p><p><p>Respecting people who take astrology seriously does not impress others with
<br>
your tolerance.  It simply indicates that you do not understand what 
<br>
tolerance
<br>
is *for*, and that you are trying to impress others by adherence to the 
<br>
letter
<br>
of an ethic whose spirit you do not understand.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, please note that the Committee on Un-Extropian Activities will 
<br>
be
<br>
investigating all participants in this thread for possible connections to 
<br>
the
<br>
Green Party.
<br>
<p>___
<br>
I quit and became republican before the election,
<br>
but continued to supply intelligence.
<br>
I support all parties.
<br>
<p><p>PS: Thanks Eliezer.
