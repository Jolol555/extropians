<p><em>&gt;Well, yes, and that would be cheating,

<p>Who knows what will happen in this new, post-human era.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;since you wouldn't actually
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Anyway, regardless which  tactics are &quot;allowed&quot; (depends on

the referee, if any,  I suppose) or not .... my argumentative objective
<br>
HAS worked .... because you are accepting the primacy of the mental!
<br>
<p>Perhaps we have *already been* hypnotised to believe certain things
<br>
and to forget others ......... (a variation of the Cartesian &quot;how do we
<br>
know we aren't dreaming&quot; argument).
<br>
<p><p>S&gt; OK, do you take a Rylean view that &quot;mind&quot; is a category mistake and only
<br>
S&gt; seems a thing because language exists that describes it as an 'object?'
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No, but I reserve &quot;category error&quot; to refer to a very particular kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of logical error.  I think the notion of a &quot;mind&quot; and &quot;mental events&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;makes logical sense, that there's nothing logically contradictory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about them.  I think one can be a consistent epiphenomenalist.
</em><br>
<p>So you reject Ryle's general approach, which is behaviourist
<br>
in much the same way that yours seems to be?
<br>
<p>The cost of being a purist epiphenomenalist includes adopting
<br>
a very anti-intuitive view involving some absurd denials.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;why?  :) Why not be an anti-realist instead? ;)
</em><br>
<p>A matter of taste and cognitive style ... as I said previously.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To the extent that I agree with Ryle, I take him to be telling a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plausible story about what led us to conclude that consciousness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really out there, that we shouldn't reinterpret &quot;consciousness&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;refer to non-mental entities.
</em><br>
<p>OK. I also think that language is faulty and misleading in general,
<br>
which I why I am starting to develop a word-free visual philosophy
<br>
(some examples at www.extropia.net vis phil sector).
<br>
<p>S&gt; There seems some mileage in this, but I happen to think that if MVT
<br>
S&gt; accounts for all types of animal intelligence/ conscious behaviour
<br>
S&gt; and (observable) cognitive patterns ... then it does permit me to
<br>
S&gt; postulate an extended &quot;analogous&quot; stronger version that take in
<br>
S&gt; consciousness as well ... if only for the sake of aesthetic
<br>
S&gt; completion ... and because some people will be able to find use in
<br>
S&gt; accepting the MVT structure (to replace faulty supernaturalist and
<br>
S&gt; lingoistic competing theories of 'consciousness' such as Berkeley's
<br>
S&gt; Mind of God Idealism).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes and no.  In fairness, until Foucault's Pendulum rolled around,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there really was no &quot;scientific&quot; way to settle the debate as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether the sun revolved around the earth or the earth around the sun;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;after all, relative to the earth, the sun moves, and relative to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sun, the earth moves.  Only by invoking the added principle of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elegance and explanatory simplicity did the Copernican astrology gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an advantage.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, a shorter or more elegant proof in maths is better than one
<br>
using more terms. I claim MVT is the simplest and most elegant
<br>
account. MVT also explains more phenomena, and reduces several
<br>
other theories in science (and philosophy) to a more basic account.
<br>
<p>Of course these extra principles are subjective rather than empirical.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;After the fact, we now regard these to be normative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientific values, principles which guide our scientific beliefs.
</em><br>
<p>Are &quot;principles&quot; physical then? Otherwise your determinist position
<br>
starts to come apart ... What about &quot;desires&quot; ... didn't you say that
<br>
our beliefs only come from desires (or was it vice-versa)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is literally philosophy which BECOMES science, not by virtue of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;new discoveries, but via a change in scientific paradigms.
</em><br>
<p>Reprogramming of the scientific metaprogram, or mass hypnosis?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You might well get away with postulating that you've nailed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness as well as conscious behavior.  I take it that our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;CURRENT scientific values, our current beliefs about what claims are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientifically grounded and which are not, do not allow you to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this move, except via an oblique invocation of elegance as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientific principle.
</em><br>
<p>No, I allow conscious phenomena, so I can accept elegance as
<br>
a &quot;concept.&quot; I don't think all principles have to be scientific ...
<br>
I am a bodhisattva and magus, after all, and use subjective principles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And who knows, maybe in the future, science
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will look back and say of those who denied that we had solved the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;puzzle of consciousness that we have overlooked an important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientific value.  But for now, as I use the term &quot;science,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness theory is not science, whereas intelligence theory is.
</em><br>
<p>That's true.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Your stricter aesthetic does not permit you to find merit in the
<br>
S&gt; stronger conclusions of MVT, but does help in answering the
<br>
S&gt; important questions about the evolution of animal &quot;conscious
<br>
S&gt; behaviour&quot; .... so everybody should be happy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Just so!  But before I admit this, I want to call attention to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;important philosophical move, one about which I will probably write my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;senior thesis.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;To say that &quot;everybody is happy&quot; requires us to remain blissfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ignorant about the aesthetic/philosophical question of the mind/body
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem.  It requires us to not know or care the answer to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question: &quot;is this really a theory of consciousness or not?&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;We might be sceptical about our capacity to answer that question.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might be sort-of pragmatic anti-philosophers and say: &quot;that question
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cannot be answered&quot; or, even better, &quot;do not ask that question.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Those who refuse to ask the question cannot be coerced into asking it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and may remain consistently sceptical about any answer you put
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forward.  To the extent that we answer it, it seems, we engage in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophy, which may or may not be &quot;scientific&quot; philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>That may be true if words are your ONLY medium of communication.
<br>
The &quot;questioning&quot; idea might not be problematic if we commune using
<br>
touch signals, or visual display predominantly. &quot;Questioning&quot; might
<br>
translate to a &quot;feeling of puzzlement&quot; of a particular grain. I might
<br>
want to say that we can rely on and trust our *feelings* (that MVT
<br>
is the true account) more than lots of us currently do. Or I might
<br>
appeal to pattern completion and recognition, and suggest that our
<br>
judgement be based on a satisfactory visualisation of the matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; The category of a particular area of space as a &quot;hole&quot; is indeed
<br>
S&gt; psychological ... the hole can only be demarked independently of its
<br>
S&gt; (physical) substrate by the naming of it (seeing it, pattern completion,
<br>
S&gt; and formulating it as a linguistic/ conceptual entity). It has no
<br>
&quot;matter&quot;
<br>
S&gt; so isn't physical ..... but is observable ... an observer-related effect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes, but we must be careful not to overload the term &quot;psychological.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Feelings are psychological, and so are &quot;holes,&quot; but they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychological in very different ways.  Sadness, for example, has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical place at all, by virtue of its purely mental character.
</em><br>
<p>I don't disagree with this. We have infinite-state potential to experience
<br>
and feeling imaginable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Holes are physical bits of space (or functions/components, ...) that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we use our minds to demarcate.
</em><br>
<p>Let me understand this correctly ... you claim that &quot;space&quot; or &quot;void&quot;
<br>
is physical ... although it just has location and not any matter/ physical
<br>
stuff? I think &quot;location&quot; is a dimension, much like &quot;time&quot; .. and as such
<br>
isn't necessarily (or maybe isn't either probably, or even *possibly*)
<br>
physical. Matter, time and space are assigned as different variants
<br>
in physics  ... so can  these things be identical?
<br>
<p>I include &quot;possibly&quot; because of the possible that all is mental, and space,
<br>
physical stuff, atoms and all the rest of it are just concepts combined
<br>
with conscious perceptions (real virtuality in MVT-terms) plus
<br>
self-generated
<br>
imagination. Anyway, you are not consistent saying that &quot;we use our minds
<br>
to demarcate&quot; if your system does not include &quot;minds&quot; ... conscious organs.
<br>
<p>I can use &quot;minds&quot; of course, because I think they are phantom pineal senors!
<br>
<p><em> &gt;The NAME of the hole has a mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;component, but the hole itself, the referent, has no mental component
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at all, despite the fact that its edges are mentally determined.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Feelings, on the other hand, have nothing BUT mental components.
</em><br>
<p>S&gt; This seems at least as &quot;sensible&quot; as the epiphenomenalist claim.
<br>
S&gt; Again, I think the issue might be as much to do with aesthetics and
<br>
S&gt; cognitive style as to which side of this (ultimately pointless)
<br>
S&gt; divide you choose.  I prefer to concentrate on the empirical matters
<br>
S&gt; and observable phenomena, and think this conversation has been a
<br>
S&gt; prime example of the ultimate futility of philosophical analysis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, yes.  It's a philosophical problem which we resolve by pondering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our intuitions on the matter, or which we refuse to resolve, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's pointless.
</em><br>
<p>Why don't you do your Senior thesis (?) on MVT ... much less boring.
<br>
I have a mass of publications on it.
<br>
<p>S&gt; The link between phantom (ex-) limbs and sensations in the previously
<br>
S&gt; physically occupied space is well documented in medical science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Right, assuming science exists in the first place, uses real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equipment, consists of real researchers...  This is why I find
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phenomenology worrisome.
</em><br>
<p>I believe in scientists, and have even seen some, what's the problem?
<br>
This isn't asking you (poor sceptic) to believe in fairies .. you can go
<br>
see (touch, smell, have sex with) the scientists for yourself.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Likewise the neurosignature and gateway theory of pain strongly
<br>
S&gt; supports this linkage. In practice (as a therapist) we do not have
<br>
S&gt; the luxury of engaging in philosophical quibbles, but must act
<br>
S&gt; positively to alleviate the symptoms according to our best
<br>
S&gt; judgement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Of course.
</em><br>
<p>S&gt; Your &quot;consciousness isn't real&quot; posture just doesn't cut it in workaday
<br>
S&gt; reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It works just as well as its opposing view, so long as one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pro-actively reinterprets consciousness claims into something else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;When you say you're in pain, you mean that your E fibers are firing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and that's a bad thing; better get you some ibuprofen.&quot;  In practice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we simply don't decide whether to re-interpret consciousness claims or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not, since their reinterpretation does not affect our decisions about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what to do about &quot;pain,&quot; whether pain is mental or purely physical.
</em><br>
<p>But our senses, through which we interpret the world .. and our common
<br>
sense, or &quot;how we&quot; combine and interpret sense data, can recognise
<br>
the &quot;feel&quot; experience of *pain* because we KNOW what it is like ourselves.
<br>
A torturer can soon change someone's mind (though not as elegantly as
<br>
my new system of hypnosis arguably!)
<br>
<p>S&gt; But you have conceded the priority of the mental by your admission that
<br>
IF
<br>
S&gt; my MVT hypnotic persuasion works, then you agree with my stronger claims
<br>
S&gt; for MVT. We only ever *experience* the world as filtered through ideation
<br>
S&gt; and our senses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No, you misunderstood.  I simply granted that I'd believe you if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hypnotized me, which follows directly from the fact that I'd be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hypnotized.  I'd believe that there were fairies in my garden if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hypnotized me into believing as much.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, so are there some truth or empirical grounds which reinforce even the
<br>
hypnosis, or make the hypnosis easier to take if experience is in
<br>
agreement? And given that we could already be in trance or working on
<br>
post-hypnotic suggestions, how do you make any truth claims for your own
<br>
beliefs in determinism, epiphenobblyism and all that Turing machine rubbish?
<br>
<p><p>S&gt; No Turing machines of the sort you discuss have ever, not will ever,be
<br>
S&gt; built.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;.Perhaps not, but only on account of their being too cumbersome, slow,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expensive, and hard to build, not by virtue of their being different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in principle.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, or in other words the idea of building them is daft! So why would
<br>
evolution (infinitely pragmatic) have used such a daft design?
<br>
<p>Evolution sculpted the experiencing brain out of neural components which
<br>
also work together as (interchangeable) circuits directly from contact with
<br>
natural and survival demands ... (not designed by a team of mad scientists).
<br>
The circuits could only function in a self-organising, reconfigurable,
<br>
intelligent
<br>
way after the pineal eye (equivalent of external clock in a silicon circuit)
<br>
went
<br>
and left a (*functional* .. not primarily a physical gap, though there is
<br>
the
<br>
foramen gap &amp;c.) atrophied. Self-generated representations of the
<br>
environment
<br>
(illusionary or imagined external environment) becomes possible extra to
<br>
the input from the externally directed senses.
<br>
<p>S&gt; So you would be convinced by the practice, but not by the theory
<br>
S&gt; ... a fair comment. I adhere to certain psychotherapeutic ethics
<br>
S&gt; that might inhibit me using such techniques on you involuntarily,
<br>
S&gt; but I might consider doing this experiment if you consent ......
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Again, you misunderstand.  I'd be convinced, but only by virtue of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hypnosis, not by holding better beliefs.  Your capacity to hypnotize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me doesn't prove your philosophical point.
</em><br>
<p>OK .. this point is dealt with above ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Isn't the answer obvious?  You say, like a true scientist: &quot;I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know the answer.  There is no evidence.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; Neo-Darwinian evolution remains a &quot;theory&quot; and religious creationist
<br>
S&gt; fundamentalists will never accept it as fact ... but in practice most
<br>
S&gt; scientists (as opposed to quibbling philosophers) accept it in practice
<br>
S&gt; since the circumstantial, explanatory and utility case for is
<br>
overwhelming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, yes.  Ultimately, the biologists and the creationists disagree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about what may legitimately be called &quot;science.&quot;  I think it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adequately established that evolution is in and creation is out; I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;add that consciousness theory is out too, though it might get in if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our views of science changed or if we just leaned more heavily on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elegance than we do now.
</em><br>
<p>Even in my lifetime I have seen different academic themes go in and
<br>
out of fashion ... this is how the human-beens conduct their business.
<br>
For instance, Logical Positivism went completely out, though it said
<br>
the same thing all along. At one point the humans liked it, then, fed up.
<br>
<p>I guess that means it is up to be to change minds and convince people ..
<br>
<p><p>S&gt; The SHAPE of the brain effects its function, the shape evolved, and
<br>
S&gt; (gestalt) can be described in terms of foreground OR background
<br>
S&gt; (holes), or both.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But holes are different from sadness; different in kind and in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principle.  They may be linked, but they're not the same.
</em><br>
<p>No, you continue to misunderstand that &quot;holes&quot; are an analogy that
<br>
I use to point out some shared attributes with the &quot;absent&quot; or &quot;abstract&quot;
<br>
pineal eye .... but I by no means hold that this analogy is the whole story.
<br>
<p>s&gt; Then, if we are determined in such a way that we have the option to
<br>
S&gt; intervene and change our cognitive patterns .... then we are determined
<br>
S&gt; in such a way that we have free-will. The whole trans/ post-human venture
<br>
S&gt; is an exercise of free-will against the cultural conditioning to remain
<br>
the
<br>
S&gt; same (boring, human, not-fit-to-run-the-planet received wisdom).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, of course, there is a weak version of free-will, according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which we have free will if only we can make decisions independently of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our genetics and our fellow man, but NOT necessarily independent of,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say, the state of the Earth yesterday or last week or last year.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must agree with that weaker version.
</em><br>
<p>I will reciprocally agree with a weaker version of determinism: after
<br>
all we cannot step outside this Universe (at least very easily!) and I
<br>
accept that we do not have free will in all things. Perhaps by combining
<br>
these weaker versions we can stop this tired old Free Will debate?
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt;If philosophy one day descends into hypno-wars, I'm bailing.  :)  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I largely agree with this.
</em><br>
<p>Some would say it always has been ... reputation of the philosopher
<br>
and presentational &amp; fashion success have always held a sway.
<br>
<p>S&gt; I agree that von Neumann machines &amp; neural nets can often both solve
<br>
S&gt; the same problems ... and that both ultimately rely on the laws of
<br>
S&gt; statistical mechanics ... but the von Neumann machines ARE determined
<br>
S&gt; more fully since they are fully predictive, whereas the internal
<br>
S&gt; state of neural computers are NOT analysable and discrete ..... the
<br>
S&gt; weight state does not translate into particular known
<br>
S&gt; properties. Serial machine emulations are just that,
<br>
S&gt; simulations. They are running a whole bunch of code whilst true
<br>
S&gt; parallel neuro-computers have no code.  They cannot DO real-time
<br>
S&gt; computations .. so how can you even say that they &quot;emulate&quot; real
<br>
S&gt; time computations?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I never said that they did it in real time... they do it considerably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;slower than that.  But doing it at all is interesting.
</em><br>
<p>NO ... why go with a less good analogy, a less efficient proof,
<br>
and with a daft imaginary (Turing) architecture when you would
<br>
learn far more looking at neural (silicon) computation ... which
<br>
sculpt themselves from experience rather than running code ...
<br>
<p>The von Neumann and Turing analogies as to how a brain works
<br>
are of as much use and out of date as the 1920's analogies between
<br>
the brain and a telephone exchange.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particular, if you had a slow person who still had REM, still claimed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to have dreams and told me about them, still told me how they felt,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still talked to me like an ordinary slow person, I'd be drawn to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conclude that they were just like me, only slower, including having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness, only slower, assuming I have it in the first place.
</em><br>
<p>This isn't a case of just &quot;equivalent but slower&quot; .... they would also be
<br>
working in a completely different way from you. Neural computers
<br>
are reverse engineered from brain circuits, so are a lot more
<br>
convincing ... this ISN'T just an aesthetic matter either ... the neural
<br>
computational model of the brain is BETTER than the older serial
<br>
computational models ... sure a load of sluggard academics still use it
<br>
