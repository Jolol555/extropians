<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Low dose aspirin helps prevent Alzheimer's disease
<br>
<p>The November issue of the journal Archives of Neurology featured the
<br>
results of an Australian  analysis (The Sydney Older Persons Study) of 647
<br>
subjects with an average age of 81 years, which demonstrated that the use
<br>
low doses of aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is
<br>
associated with a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease.   One hundred
<br>
sixty-three subjects were diagnosed with various forms of dementia, with
<br>
seventy-eight of these diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease without vascular
<br>
dementia, forty-five with vascular dementia, and forty with other
<br>
dementias.   Three hundred seventy-three participants served as controls.
<br>
<p>Fifty drug groups were analyzed for their association with the diagnostic
<br>
groups.  There was an inverse correlation observed between aspirin or
<br>
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and the incidence of Alzheimer's
<br>
disease.  The association was not observed for other dementia diagnoses.
<br>
Analysis of the results did not reveal a dose dependent effect, with
<br>
response the same for high or low doses.  An inverse correlation was also
<br>
observed between the risk of Alzheimer's disease and the class of drugs
<br>
known as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
<br>
<p>The finding concerning low doses of aspirin or NSAIDS is promising.
<br>
Previous studies had uncovered a correlation between high doses of aspirin
<br>
or NSAIDs and Alzheimer's disease, a finding which, although significant,
<br>
can be risky to put into practice because of the liver damage and gastric
<br>
bleeding associated with high doses of these drugs.
<br>
<p>The researchers believe that the benefit of aspirin or NSAIDs might be due
<br>
to the improvement of blood flow, because of the the reduction of blood
<br>
clotting.
<br>
<p><p>PROTOCOL
<br>
<p>Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and is
<br>
the fourth leading cause of death in developed nations (after heart
<br>
disease, cancer, and stroke). Up to 70% of dementia cases are due to
<br>
Alzheimer's disease, with blood vessel disease (stroke, atherosclerosis)
<br>
being the second most common cause. The frequency of Alzheimer's among
<br>
60-year-olds is about 1%. The incidence doubles approximately every 5
<br>
years, becoming 2% at age 65, 4% at 70, 8% at 75, 16% at 80, and 32% at
<br>
85. It is estimated that as many as two thirds of those in their 90s
<br>
suffer from some form of dementia. For those who aspire to live a very
<br>
long life, dementia is a threat second only to death-or is death in
<br>
another form.
<br>
<p>Alzheimer's disease is incurable. It leads to death within an average of 8
<br>
years after diagnosis, the last 3 of which are typically spent in an
<br>
institution. Besides memory loss, Alzheimer's patients show dramatic
<br>
personality changes, disorientation, declining physical coordination, and
<br>
an inability to care for themselves. In the final stages, victims are
<br>
bedridden, lose urinary and bowel control, and suffer epileptic attacks.
<br>
Death is usually due to pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
<br>
<p>Studies with 2 or 3 grams a day of acetyl-L-carnitine have shown a reduced
<br>
rate of disease progression for Alzheimer's patients. Acetyl-L-carnitine
<br>
reduces lipofuscin in neurons. Although lipofuscin is cellular debris from
<br>
glycation and oxidation, detrimental effects in general and a contribution
<br>
to Alzheimer's disease in particular have not been shown. The (modest)
<br>
benefits of acetyl-L-carnitine are more likely due to its ability to
<br>
normalize cell metabolism, increase NGF utilization, and increase
<br>
acetylcholine synthesis.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Healthprin
<br>
<p>Numerous studies document the multiple health benefits of daily low-dose
<br>
aspirin. While abnormal platelet aggregation (which can cause a heart
<br>
attack or stroke) can be inhibited by vitamin C and E, fish oil, and
<br>
herbal extracts such as ginkgo and bilberry, aspirin provides additional
<br>
protection against abnormal blood clot formation within blood vessels.
<br>
<p>In addition to inhibiting blood from forming clots inside arteries,
<br>
aspirin has been shown to inhibit prostaglandin E2, which has been linked
<br>
to many chronic inflammatory conditions that may result in
<br>
colon-esophageal cancers and other diseases.
<br>
<p>In order to make it easy to take low-dose aspirin, The Life Extension
<br>
Foundation offers a bottle of 500 heart-shaped tablets containing 81 mg of
<br>
aspirin per tablet. These easy to swallow tablets are equal to 1/4 of one
<br>
aspirin tablet, which is the dose the published studies indicated may be
<br>
ideal to prevent heart attacks, and possibly, prevent some forms of
<br>
cancer.

<p>Acetyl-L-carnitine
<br>
<p>Aging occurs when the energy producing components of the cell deteriorate,
<br>
resulting in reduced cellular metabolic activity, the accumulation of
<br>
cellular debris, and the eventual death of the cell.
<br>
<p>The most effective antiaging therapy to maintain youthful cellular energy
<br>
metabolism is the amino acid L-carnitine, which functions via several
<br>
mechanisms to protect cells from the effects of aging.
<br>
<p>Acetyl-L-carnitine is the acetylated ester of the amino acid L-carnitine.
<br>
Acetyl-L-carnitine is absorbed into the bloodstream more efficiently than
<br>
L-carnitine and, more importantly, acetyl-L-carnitine passes more
<br>
effectively through cell membranes, and is utilized more efficiently in
<br>
the mitochondria of the cell.

<p><p>BLOOD TESTING SALE!
<br>
<p>People often fall victim to a disease that could have been prevented if
<br>
their blood was tested every year. When a blood test reveals an
<br>
abnormality, corrective actions can often be taken to prevent a serious
<br>
disease from developing.
<br>
<p>Since 1996, Life Extension Foundation members have been able to order
<br>
their own blood tests and pay only a fraction of the price charged by
<br>
commercial laboratories. The good news is that The Life Extension
<br>
Foundation has negotiated a better price structure with one of the
<br>
nation's largest testing laboratories. In addition to saving big money,
<br>
this new arrangement makes it more convenient for members to have their
<br>
blood drawn throughout the United States.
<br>
<p>Foundation members residing in South Florida can have their blood drawn at
<br>
the Life Extension Nutrition Center located at 995 SW 24 Street in Ft.
<br>
Lauderdale. Those residing outside of South Florida now have access to
<br>
hundreds of licensed blood drawing stations. For information about blood
<br>
testing or directions to any of these blood drawing stations, call
<br>
1-800-208-3444.
<br>
<p>There is no longer any shipping charge to add, even when having your blood
<br>
tested outside of South Florida. Members previously had to pay an extra
<br>
$20.00 in shipping charges if they had their blood drawn anywhere other
<br>
than our Ft. Lauderdale drawing station.  Please note that our retail
<br>
prices are lower than what most commercial laboratories and doctors
<br>
charge. Until April 15, 2001, The Life Extension Buyers Club is offering
<br>
an extra-special member discount on all blood tests.
