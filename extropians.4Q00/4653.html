<em>&gt; OK, I can see that for some philosophy provides entertainment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a sort ..... but why shouldn't it compete in the marketplace for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funds like jazz does rather than relying off state support?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think you guys are on the wrong track. This kind of stuff - philosophy,
<br>
including pure maths, and to some extent classic studies and other
<br>
far-removed kinds of disciplines (english lit? art history?) - underpins all
<br>
the more pragmatic bodies of knowledge. Engineering is informed by maths &amp;
<br>
philosophy, maths is informed by philosophy, etc... You can think of it as
<br>
intellectual infrastructure; analogous to the hardware communications
<br>
backbone, or an electricity grid (hmm... fuel cells... bad example).
<br>
<p>You heard the old wisdom, that the market is bad at infrastructure? So it is
<br>
with the knowledge for knowledge's sake disciplines. We've gone though a
<br>
paradigm shift in the west in recent years, to only valuing those
<br>
disciplines which can pay their way, which can make a quick buck. Probably
<br>
we can even get away with that, for a while...
<br>
<p>Personally, I think it's a symptom of having no strong competition. If there
<br>
was another planet out there (or even another bloc of countries) which was
<br>
seriously rivaling the west in economic/technological strength, things might
<br>
be different. As it is, we've gotten complacent, willing to run down our
<br>
greatest assets (like knowledge!), for short term gain.
<br>
<p>Funnily enough, I think people are beginning to notice the longer term
<br>
effects of this short sighted attitude. There was an article in an Aussie
<br>
national paper recently with the Prime Minister talking about a lack of
<br>
skilled people here, and hinting at a crisis in the University system - the
<br>
irony is enormous, as his government was responsible for running it down,
<br>
but anyway. The proposed solution is to bring more skilled people in from
<br>
overseas, ala H1B. We've got some top thinking going on in the federal
<br>
government here!
