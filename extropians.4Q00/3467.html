</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, I am not sure I agree it &quot;requires everyone believing in its
<br>
rightness and voting that way&quot;.  This smacks too much of unlimited
<br>
democracy and group think.  It requires enough people agreeing to make
<br>
the protection of individual rights actually enforced in this country
<br>
rather than merely claimed in our basic documents.  It requires people
<br>
learning (whether they agree or not) to leave one another alone in the
<br>
sense of not forcing their beliefs on others.  It requires that enough
<br>
people understand the issues and raise enough of a stink when elected
<br>
officials violate individual rights and make the stink in terms of
<br>
individual rights and the Constitutional mandate to protect them (that
<br>
these self-same officials have sworn to uphold).  It doesn't require
<br>
that everyone gets it.  It requires that our elected officials know they
<br>
are there to protect our rights and that enough of us know that and 
<br>
will raise holy hell if they don't.  
<br>
<p>The bottom line may be that this country can no longer be swayed from
<br>
destruction through its current political institutions.  But we can't
<br>
say that without working a bit more at it.  If it cannot then it will be
<br>
time for a second American revolution or for a partial succession or for
<br>
founding something entirely different.
