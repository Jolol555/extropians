Subject: Modeling of Biological Systems Course at Woods Hole
<br>
<p>Good afternoon.
<br>
<p>The use of modeling in biological and medical sciences is increasing at a
<br>
quickening pace.  Modeling is opening new perspectives and appreciation to
<br>
biological entities and processes that are often not accessible by
<br>
available &quot;wet&quot; methods or in an acceptable time frame.
<br>
<p>Areas being advanced by modeling include: molecular structure and dynamics,
<br>
cell structure and dynamics, genomics, proteomics, cellomics, metabolic
<br>
networks, biophysics of ion channels, physiology and epidemiology,
<br>
population biology and ecology.
<br>
<p>Recently, we launched a multi-disciplinary course titled Modeling of
<br>
Biological Systems, or  MOBS.  The MOBS Course is supported by the
<br>
Burroughs Wellcome Fund, and the National Science Foundation.
<br>
<p>The goal of the MOBS Course is to bring together biologists, chemists,
<br>
engineers, mathematicians, physicists and others into a residence course to
<br>
learn from and with folks from many disciplines, and address questions of
<br>
common interests.
<br>
<p>The MOBS 2000 Course was a rousing success for all participants, with a
<br>
positive impact on the research of the students.  We are looking forward to
<br>
another exciting course in 2001.
<br>
<p>I am pleased to call your attention to the Modeling of Biological Systems
<br>
(MOBS) Course for 2001.  You will find the MOBS Course website at:
<br>
<a href="http://courses.mbl.edu/MOBS/">http://courses.mbl.edu/MOBS/</a>
<br>
<p>At the MOBS site, you will find a more detailed description of the MOBS
<br>
Course, application forms, and  -- most importantly  -- comments from the
<br>
students of MOBS 2000.
<br>
<p>I encourage you to apply for the MOBS 2001 Course, and to bring MOBS to the
<br>
attention of others that may be interested in this exciting area. The MOBS
<br>
course is designed for students ranging from advanced graduate students
<br>
through post-docs -- and above levels of training.
<br>
<p>I have attached  pdf  copies of the application and evaluation forms for
<br>
your convenience.
<br>
<p>Directions for applying are on the forms and at the MOBS website.  The
<br>
deadline for receipt of aplications for MOBS 2001 is December 29, 2000.
<br>
<p>Some scholarship support is available for the successful applicants.
<br>
<p>Should you have questions about applying to the MOBS 2001 Course -- please
<br>
contact <a href="mailto:admisisons@mbl.edu?Subject=Re:%20Modeling%20of%20Biological%20Systems%20Course%20at%20Woods%20Hole&In-Reply-To=&lt;v03110700b65a07f503f8@[213.23.4.10]&gt;">admisisons@mbl.edu</a>
<br>
<p>Should you have technical questions about the MOBS 2001 Course, please feel
<br>
free to send them to me at:  <a href="mailto:rsilver@mbl.edu?Subject=Re:%20Modeling%20of%20Biological%20Systems%20Course%20at%20Woods%20Hole&In-Reply-To=&lt;v03110700b65a07f503f8@[213.23.4.10]&gt;">rsilver@mbl.edu</a>
<br>
<p>We look forward to receiving and reviewing your application.
<br>
<p>Best wishes for a safe and enjoyable holiday season.
