<em>&gt; &gt; Subject: Fermi Paradox in the news...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's interesting to see these issues gradually percolate into the public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness. Of course Mr. Dyer doesn't mention the most probable
</em><br>
cause
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (IMHO) of the silence, which is that the aliens are using very precisely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aimed low powered signals, compressed sufficiently to be
</em><br>
indistinguishable
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from thermal noise, even if we did happen to be in the line of sight of
</em><br>
one
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of them, which we probably aren't. Oh well :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   This is the same sort of argument fanatics give to prove the existance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of god. Since there is absolutely no positive evidence in favour of either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ETs or god, the simplest and most plausible explanation of this fact is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that neither ETs nor god exist. This is a brutally obviously argument to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any rational individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think I quite swallow this argument, the standard argument against
<br>
the existence of life elsewhere in the universe.
<br>
<p>We assume a lot of things about the universe. We assume that gravity works
<br>
everywhere, that the atomic world is the same everywhere, etc. We assume a
<br>
level of consistency across existence, with respect to physical laws (this
<br>
may not be exactly true; I think some theories involve different laws of
<br>
physics in weird places, but those are the exception that proves the rule).
<br>
The point is, that we expect our theories about physical reality to be
<br>
universal.
<br>
<p>Much of the solid argument for life elsewhere comes from analysing these
<br>
rules, and noticing that life might not be a statistical fluke which
<br>
happened here, it might be a fairly common and robust process, which is
<br>
likely to occur many times, very likely more than once. I guess the jury is
<br>
still out on this, but it seems that this point of view, amongst those who
<br>
ought to know (not me), is swinging away from life being very uncommon, to
<br>
life likely being quite common.
<br>
<p>And naturally we then look at the age of the universe, the age of our own
<br>
ancestry (from slop to here), and think that, if life is a common occurence,
<br>
and intelligence is also a relatively common occurence in biosystems (is
<br>
this supportable?), then likely there has been and probably is a lot of
<br>
intelligent life around right now. So where are they?
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the existence of G is an entirely different matter.
<br>
Existence of ET's is an extrapolation, if not purely logical then eminently
<br>
plausible,  from what we know of the physical universe. On the other hand,
<br>
the existence of G is not predicted by any physical theories, and in fact
<br>
seems to be entirely precluded; as we learn more, there is less place for G.
<br>
That's not an accident of course, as the scientific method appears to say
<br>
&quot;Given non-existence of G, how does X work&quot;?
<br>
<p>Occam's razor is a curely principle, purely aesthetic as far as I can see.
<br>
How do you define &quot;simple&quot;? Given the choice between the existence and
<br>
absence of something, absence is not always the simpler path. The absence of
<br>
gravitation in the far flung reaches of space would not be a simplifying
<br>
assumption; nor, perhaps, would be the absence of life.
