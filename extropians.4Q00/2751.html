<em>&gt; The consensus of the experts, according to my reading over the last 20
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years or so, is that 8-10 reps per set maximizes muscle growth. 4-6 reps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will maximize strength, while 15 or more reps (with short rest breaks) will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improve aerobic conditioning and muscle tone with less muscle growth.
</em><br>
<p>New information... exercise program modified accordingly.
<br>
<p>What I want, actually, is to *now* build a reasonably healthy physique
<br>
that will *later* be easily maintainable (30 minutes 3 times per week, or
<br>
whatever) and that won't vanish in a flash if I stop exercising for a
<br>
week.  I'm guessing that means maximize muscle growth now with 8-10 reps
<br>
per set (which is what I have now started doing), then switch to 15 reps
<br>
per set when I think it's time to start getting ready for the transition
<br>
to &quot;maintenance&quot;.  Right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -- Cut down on carbs that have no real nutrition and replace with lean

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- An hour or so before working out, drink a protein shake containing whey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protein, creatine (which will immediately produce a weight gain due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; water retention but will help you push your muscles harder), and glutamine.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I'm currently trying to keep in the range of about 1250 calories
<br>
per day, and have already gone from over 220 pounds to 190.  Is it
<br>
reasonable to try and build muscle and lose fat at the same time, or is it
<br>
just outright impossible?  I got the impression it was reasonable.
<br>
<p>What worries me, at the moment, is that whenever I miss two days of
<br>
exercise, I seem to drop two pounds.  Does this have something to do with
<br>
water retention or is it &quot;easy come, easy go&quot; muscle mass?
<br>
<p>(Incidentally, no, I'm not taking any anti-oxidants.  While ordinarily a
<br>
fan of not setting yourself up for a catastrophe if the Singularity
<br>
happens later than expected, a 21-year-old taking anti-oxidants would be
<br>
going much too far.  Unless my impressions are mistaken and anti-oxidants
<br>
have immediate health benefits?)
