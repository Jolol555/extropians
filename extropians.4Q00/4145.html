</em><br>
<p>One of the points of divergence between transhumanism and humanism is that 
<br>
transhumanists explicitly reject a certain anthropocentrism common among 
<br>
some humanists. This holds in the direction of possible future 
<br>
technological sentients, but also in my view in the direction of other 
<br>
biological sentients, be they extraterrestrials or non-human sentient 
<br>
animals on Earth.

<p><em>&gt;A fascist with a consistent restricted sense of what it is to be

<em>&gt;characteristic of the &quot;human&quot; character of one race relative to the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;this definition of &quot;humanity,&quot; it would be no less implausible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expect a humanist fascist than to expect a humanist who believed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it was the right of humanity to dominate over horses, cattle, sheep,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;etc.
</em><br>
<p>Would such a characterization of the human character really be consistent 
<br>
with transhumanism, though? And even if it were, since transhumanists hold 
<br>
that there is no moral prerogative attached to being human per se, but only 
<br>
to various properties which humans have (e.g. sentience), it would make no 
<br>
difference from the transhumanist perspective if some human race weren't 
<br>
human in the fascist's sense.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Even under a relatively normal definition of what it is to be human,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fascists usually also have (incorrect) consequentialist arguments in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;favor of genocide and racial slavery, arguments that most individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;benefit more than minorities are harmed by fascism.  They might argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that a tiny minority (&quot;the Jews,&quot; for example,) has the character of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;making life considerably worse for the rest of human society, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;punishing members of this racial minority is as justifiable on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grounds of human welfare as the punishment of a human criminal for his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crimes: though the criminal is human, punishing criminals makes life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better for all the rest of us.
</em><br>
<p>If we were living in one of those logically possible worlds in which 
<br>
exterminating a minority would lead to overall better conditions, then 
<br>
maybe transhumanism in that world would favour that. But we're living in 
<br>
the actual world, and transhumanism as it is defined here incorporates 
<br>
certain contingent truths about this world. That respect for the rights of 
<br>
minorities is good, is one of these claims that is part of current 
<br>
transhumanism, as I think is reflected in the rhetoric about the importance 
<br>
of individuals having the right to make their own choices about whether to 
<br>
use new technologies for example.
<br>
<p>Now, there are parts of transhumanism that could change, and transhumanism 
<br>
would still be transhumanism. So if you wanted a &quot;logical&quot; definition of 
<br>
transhumanism you could not include those parts. But then, maybe 
<br>
transhumanism is not one of those concepts that admit of a neat clear-cut 
<br>
logical definition. Recall Wittgenstein's example of the concept of a game 
<br>
- there is no non-trivial property that can be articulated that all and 
<br>
only games have; rather, &quot;game&quot; is a concept whose instances are united by 
<br>
a &quot;family resemblance&quot;.
<br>
<p>Suppose (no matter how implausible it is) that an irrefutable scientific 
<br>
discovery was made that some human race was by its very nature constituted 
<br>
such as to be the master of some other race, and that that would lead in 
<br>
the long run to the best results for everybody. Then I suppose one would 
<br>
(even as a transhumanist) have to favor the &quot;master race&quot; taking over. But 
<br>
does that means that it is no a part of transhumanism that such racism is 
<br>
wrong? I think not. (I did say in an earlier email that one could 
<br>
consistently be a &quot;flat-earth&quot; transhumanist. But that is a different case, 
<br>
because transhumanism does not speak of the shape of the earth, whereas it 
<br>
does speak, in general terms, about how we should relate to each other as 
<br>
human beings.)
<br>
<p>I know that from a philosophical point of view, it would be nice to have a 
<br>
sharp set of necessary and sufficient conditions for being a transhumanist. 
<br>
But in practise, I fear that imposing such a definition would either lead 
<br>
to too many theses being baked in (dogmatism) or else to the whole notion 
<br>
of transhumanism being fairly vacuous, which would make it impossible for 
<br>
example in a media interview to represent the &quot;transhumanist perspective&quot; 
<br>
on some concrete issue. So I think we will have to live with some 
<br>
ambiguities, while working towards a more gradual articulation and 
<br>
refinement of the world-view we call &quot;transhumanism&quot;.
