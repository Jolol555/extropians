<em>&gt;  From the opening description of David Brin (whose books I've seen on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the shelf, but I've never read), I was anticipating a good thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provoking article.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead, Mr. Brin didn't really argue anything in a substantive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner.  The little snippets that almost looked like sub-arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were so loaded with false dilemmas and straw men that I gave up any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea of pointing them all out.
</em><br>
<p>Then you missed the point of the article.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The line that had me scratching my head the most was this one:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I admit turning around and often voting for Democrats in general elections.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He claims to be mostly a Libertarian, but he actually votes for Democrats.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.  Because he believes that Libertarian aims can be more effectively
<br>
achieved by improving the system - which requires working within it, and
<br>
thus working with The Powers That Be - than the current ideal of
<br>
destroying the system and starting over (which is presumably what the
<br>
L candidates he voted against were promoting).
<br>
<p>Summary: passing and changing laws and instituations to promote
<br>
individuality, rather than merely repealing/removing most or all
<br>
existing laws and institutions, is an approach that the public is more
<br>
likely to vote into office.  It is also more likely to bring better
<br>
results in practice, even if either one were equally able to gain power.
