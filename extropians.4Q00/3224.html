Does the world want privacy more or less than information wants to be
<br>
free? Does the one exclude the other? Which side will prevail?
<br>
<p>I don't believe privacy is something you &quot;achieve&quot; -- it's something you
<br>
create (temporarily).
<br>
How do you do it?
<br>
If I told you, then for the sake of my privacy (to preserve its security),
<br>
I'd have to kill you.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
