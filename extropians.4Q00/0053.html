Eugene Leitl opines,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And please stop using that &quot;Friendly&quot; thing, because it means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different things to different people. (The child molester thinks he's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being very friendly to the child, the child probably sees it in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhat different light. The Nazis were obviously only trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cleanse the world of an ancient evil. Is not whipping a pain pig
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly? Koran is Good/Evil, The Bible is Good/Evil, The Kapital is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good/Evil, &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; is Good/Evil, parents telling a child
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not to do A are being Friendly/Unfriendly &lt;insert 10^8 similiar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples&gt;).
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense. Friendly means behavior typical of a friend; showing friendship;
<br>
helpful, supportive, amicable; promoting good will.
<br>
<p>AI would want to be friendly because it's the intelligent thing to do.
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;I believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems
<br>
is just as dumb as the next guy.&quot;  -- Richard Feynman
