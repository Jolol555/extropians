Robin forwards:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      I thought some of you might find this amusing as an example of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;badly the media presents even simple statistics and how such poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;analysis can be important.  On CNN, Salon, Fox Television News and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elsewhere a big deal has been made of a graph (attached) showing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Pat Buchanan had far more votes in Palm Beach County than in any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Florida county.  Need I explain the error any further? :)  What follows
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is an II press release on the issue and two graphs which tell the story.
</em><br>
<p>It is amazing that two different presentations of the same data can lead
<br>
to completely different interpretations.
<br>
<p>Harvey presented us with Buchanan's vote by county.  If we sort it by
<br>
percentage, we can see that the Palm Beach vote is not too unusual:
<br>
<p>Calhoun*        1.74%      90    /        5174
<br>
Liberty*        1.62%      39    /        2410
<br>
Gulf*           1.16%      71    /        6144
<br>
Washington*     1.10%      88    /        8021
<br>
Holmes*         1.03%      76    /        7395
<br>
Union*          0.97%      37    /        3826
<br>
Baker*          0.90%      73    /        8154
<br>
Suwannee*       0.87%     108    /       12441
<br>
Palm Beach*     0.79%    3407    /      432286
<br>
Bradford*       0.75%      65    /        8673
<br>
Franklin*       0.71%      33    /        4644
<br>
Walton*         0.66%     120    /       18318
<br>
Jackson*        0.63%     102    /       16300
<br>
Dixie*          0.62%      29    /        4666
<br>
Santa Rosa*     0.62%     311    /       50319
<br>
Hamilton*       0.58%      23    /        3964
<br>
Putnam*         0.56%     148    /       26222
<br>
... [lower percentages truncated]
<br>
<p>However the L.A. times had a different chart the other day, a scatter
<br>
chart showing the total Buchanan vote against the total county vote.
<br>
We can approximate this by sorting Harvey's figures by county size:
<br>
<p>Miami-Dade*     0.09%    560     /      625362
<br>
Broward*        0.14%    788     /      573396
<br>
Palm Beach*     0.79%   3407     /      432286
<br>
Pinellas*       0.25%   1013     /      398469
<br>
Hillsborough*   0.24%    847     /      360295
<br>
Orange*         0.16%    446     /      280125
<br>
Duval*          0.25%    652     /      264636
<br>
Brevard*        0.26%    570     /      218395
<br>
Lee*            0.17%    305     /      184377
<br>
Volusia*        0.27%    496     /      183256
<br>
Polk*           0.32%    532     /      168486
<br>
Sarasota*       0.19%    305     /      160942
<br>
Pasco*          0.40%    570     /      142731
<br>
Seminole*       0.14%    194     /      137634
<br>
Escambia*       0.43%    502     /      116648
<br>
Manatee*        0.25%    271     /      110221
<br>
Leon*           0.27%    282     /      103113
<br>
... [smaller counties truncated]
<br>
<p>On the Times chart, the total Buchanan vote was an extreme outlier.
<br>
Most of his votes could have been fit pretty closely to a linear
<br>
regression (not necessarily passing through the origin).  On this
<br>
basis we would have expected about 800-1000 votes in Palm Beach county.
<br>
Instead we saw three to four times that number.  It was totally out of
<br>
line with the rest of the figures.
<br>
<p>So, which analysis is correct?  Are the Buchanan votes reasonable, as
<br>
might be suspected if we look only at the percentage levels compared to
<br>
other counties?  Or are they unreasonable, as appears when we look at
<br>
them compared just to other populous counties?
<br>
<p>The moral is that while the networks may have been guilty of simplistic
<br>
analysis by focusing solely on vote totals, it may also be wrong to
<br>
focus solely on percentages.
<br>
