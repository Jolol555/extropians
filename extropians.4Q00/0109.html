<p>Sorry Barbara, I missed it the first time around.
<br>
<p>I got to some degree burnt out on the &quot;the SI will squash us like bugs&quot;
<br>
theme to the discussion, something I have never agreed with or understood,
<br>
except as some kind of odd dysfunctionality among the discussants.  This is
<br>
the &quot;Darwinian theory implies utter ruthlessness and mindless rapacious
<br>
relentless consumption of every atom in the universe at the maximum rate
<br>
possible&quot; point of view.  Gene is the leading proponent of this point of
<br>
view, but others tend to support it generally, though perhaps in a somewhat
<br>
less extreme form.
<br>
<p>I support it not at all.
<br>
<p>All systems are composed of vast numbers of individual components which
<br>
function simultaneously and interdependently.  The dependent part of
<br>
interdependent is a consequence of the unavoidable nature of interaction.
<br>
If a thing existed in isolation, it could be independent.  Otherwise, as it
<br>
has to rub shoulders with the rest of the universe, it has to adapt to that
<br>
&quot;ecosystem&quot;, and that means cooperation, even cooperation in the seemingly
<br>
paradoxical form of competition.  
<br>
<p>The lion culls the old, weak, unlucky, and otherwise unfit individuals from
<br>
the wildebeast herd, thus keeping the herd strong.  A strong herd
<br>
challenges the lion's ability to hunt successfully.  Cooperation is the
<br>
rule, and unavoidable.  Competition is a form of cooperation.  Not the
<br>
apocolyptic evil of human anthropomorphic paranoia.  The various components
<br>
of an ecosystem challenge each other, constantly adjusting their fitness to
<br>
a constantly changing environment, but, at the same time, continuously
<br>
exploring those completely novel fitness frontiers opened up by the most
<br>
recent emergent phenomena.  
<br>
<p>I would assert that as intelligence increases, so does the awareness of the
<br>
value of cooperation.  
<br>
<p>So remember, whatever may be debatable about the SI, this, it seems, is
<br>
solid: its going to be MORE intelligent, not less.
<br>
<p>Ayn Rand notwithstanding, that's more INTELLIGENT, not more selfish.
<br>
<p>(I was born a wiseass, but I aspire to become a superwiseass.)  {;-)
<br>
<p>PS.  Barbara, I'll check out the Potter DeJong paper tonight.
