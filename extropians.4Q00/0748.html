<p>This is a difficult, difficult matter.  That we ever put to death a person
<br>
whose conscious or unconscious vindictive nature was a burden to society
<br>
will actually reveal more about how we educate, relate, and problem solve
<br>
our world's many problems.
<br>
<p>It is just as abrasive toward society to allow a person who has
<br>
intentionally killed another to walk free untethered, as is the very act of
<br>
killing.  Killing, of any sort, must not be taken lightly.  There is a
<br>
crack in our justice system that bends over backwards to appease the
<br>
threats of criminals who want justice, just as there is a blemish in a
<br>
system that is anxious to recriminate by death.
<br>
<p>I find that the death penalty as backward, yet I feel deep anguish over the
<br>
death of someone who has been killed.
<br>
<p>Now, back to the business of cryonics for death row inmates:  I think it
<br>
could certainly provide substantial fastforward advances in research of
<br>
cryoprotectants, etc., preparation methods and technologies, as well as the
<br>
building of more and better facilities.  I would favor such a business if
<br>
it were provided for those where there was a question of a doubt, although
<br>
can't help but feel a bit reluctant to store mass murderers.   (Although,
<br>
here a behavioral psychologist might say that the person could be cured
<br>
with proper medication, etc.  We know that the impulse to kill could be
<br>
attributed to many reasons.)
<br>
<p>As for my own dewer - I'd prefer to be stored at a different location than
<br>
one that stores death row suspendees, unless and until we learn that the
<br>
impulse to kill is a disease.
