<em>&gt; &gt; I can think of a lot of &quot;extropic&quot; people who HAVE maintained long-term

<em>&gt; Okay, we can probably cite an ample number of examples on both sides of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wedlock. As extropy accelerates, will marriage gain or lose adherentsand/or percentage points? As people live longer and healthier lives it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to me they will tend to include more than one pair-bond, and so they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will extend their families (their significant others) beyond the tenets of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marriage. IOW, the trend toward dissolved marriages will continue (as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has for the last three decades).
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but how long is the average duration of a marriage? How has this duration
<br>
changed? What about the quality? Prior to women's lib, it seems the prevailing
<br>
wisdom was that 'quantity has a quality all its own', and screw it if some of
<br>
the women didn't enjoy being brood mares, or if too many kids died from abuse
<br>
and neglect. While I agree that some states make it TOO easy for couples to
<br>
divorce, because marriage is WORK, and kids should be the primary priority of
<br>
concern for both parents, not jobs, careers, personal development, politics,
<br>
etc. I don't mind homosexual domestic partnerships at all, but I think that the
<br>
bar for both marriage and child bearing is too low. Marriage laws in most states
<br>
are essentially permitting two illiterates to incorporate as a partnership
<br>
without any business experience or training, no assets, and allows them to
<br>
assume major 18 year debts (children) every nine months with no credit record or
<br>
proof of ability to pay, and the ability to declare bankruptcy on those debts
<br>
while retaining ownership of the assets. If that's not a recipe for disaster, I
<br>
don't know what is.
