<p>Hey you materialist! URLs with spaces in them are a natural part of 
<br>
being on the internet. These URLs sometimes lead to wisdom if you 
<br>
know how to follow. Now sit back down and return to clicking the 
<br>
broken URLs fate has dealt you.
<br>
<p><p>My god, that review... I keep hearing the same damn opinion echoed,
<br>
right down to the same cliche metaphors, from people who couldn't have
<br>
possibly met! Where is this crap coming from?! It just doesn't make
<br>
sense. Having exhausted all the rational explanations, I'm left with
<br>
the following theories:
<br>
<p>1. Aliens have infiltrated our culture and are spreading defeatist
<br>
memes, presumably to non-violently pre-empt competition.
<br>
<p>2. Once a culture reaches a certain critical size a subtle, low-key
<br>
mass insanity (mass neurosis?) takes hold. CF fall of the Roman Empire.
<br>
<p>3. Humans have an inherent tendency toward self-defeatism and hatred
<br>
of success. Except us mutants.
<br>
<p>4. Some religionists went underground and resurfaced as &quot;modern&quot; luddites.
<br>
<p><p>Whatever the case, there's too many of them to enlighten. We'll soon be
<br>
overrun. The only remaining course of action is clear... let's re-read
<br>
Atlas Shrugged and start packing our bags.
