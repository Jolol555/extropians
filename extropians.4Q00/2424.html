<p>Subject: REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE
<br>
after last Tuesdays disaster................
<br>
<p>NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE
<br>
<p>To the citizens of the United States of America, In the light of
<br>
your  failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to
<br>
govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your
<br>
independence, effective today Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will
<br>
resume monarchial
<br>
duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories.  Except Utah,
<br>
which
<br>
she does not fancy.  Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP
<br>
for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there
<br>
is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America
<br>
without the need for further elections.  Congress and the Senate will be
<br>
disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether
<br>
any of you noticed.
<br>
To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules
<br>
are introduced with immediate effect:
<br>
<p>1. You should look up &quot;revocation&quot; in the Oxford English Dictionary.
<br>
Then look up &quot;aluminium&quot;.  Check the pronunciation guide.  You will be
<br>
amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it.
<br>
Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.  Look up
<br>
&quot;vocabulary&quot;.
<br>
Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises
<br>
such as &quot;like&quot; and &quot;you know&quot; is an unacceptable and inefficient form of
<br>
communication.  Look up &quot;interspersed&quot;.
<br>
<p>2. There is no such thing as &quot;US English&quot;.  We will let Microsoft know on
<br>
your behalf.
<br>
<p><p>3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australasian accents.
<br>
It really isn't that hard.
<br>
<p>4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the
<br>
good guys.
<br>
<p>5. You should relearn your original national anthem, &quot;God Save The
<br>
Queen&quot;,but only after fully carrying out task 1.
<br>
We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.
<br>
<p>6. You should stop playing American &quot;football&quot;.  There is only one
<br>
kind of football.  What you refer to as American &quot;football&quot; is not a very
<br>
good game.  The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside
<br>
your borders may have noticed that no one else plays &quot;American&quot; football.
<br>
You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play
<br>
proper football.  Initially, it would be best if you played with the
<br>
girls.  It a difficult game.
<br>
Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is
<br>
similar to American &quot;football&quot;, but does not involvestopping for a rest
<br>
every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar
<br>
body armour like nancies).  We are hoping to get together at least a US
<br>
rugby sevens side by 2005.
<br>
<p>7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons
<br>
if they give you any merde.  The 98.85% of you who were not aware
<br>
that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky.
<br>
The
<br>
Russians have never been the bad guys.  &quot;Merde&quot; is French for &quot;shit&quot;.
<br>
<p>8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday.  November 8th will be a new
<br>
national holiday, but only in England.  It will be called &quot;Indecisive Day&quot;.
<br>
<p>9. All American cars are hereby banned.  They are crap and it is for
<br>
your own good.  When we show you German cars, you will understand
<br>
what we mean.
<br>
<p>10. Please tell us who killed JFK.  It's been driving us crazy.
<br>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.
