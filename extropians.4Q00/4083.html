<p><em>&gt; I've been tuning into the list which I must say is quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thrilling. I'm now a sophmore in school, and have no clue what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to do with my life. After reading such books like The Age of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spiritual Machines etc... how can I possibly know what field to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into? Technology is just moving so quickly, and I know I am more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aware of this than most (not including extropians of course) but how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can I prepare myself for what is to come?
</em><br>
<p>When I meet the students in Computer Science 101 (or ather, our
<br>
version of it) here at the Institute, I point out to them that the
<br>
computer languages they will learn in the course will likely be
<br>
obsolete before they graduate, the programming paradigm has a good
<br>
chance to be different and lots and lots of clever new datastructures
<br>
and algorithms will have been discovered while they were busy
<br>
studying. So what is the point of it? The point is that they learn to
<br>
learn, that they know enough so that they can adapt to new languages,
<br>
paradigms and structures when they need them. It is all about
<br>
confidence in one's abilities, a solid and broad foundation and
<br>
flexible thinking. I guess this holds true for nearly every
<br>
subject. 
<br>
<p>Also, expect to go into several fields during your life. The single
<br>
career at a single company is totally dead. I fully expect that within
<br>
the next 30-40 years to have spent quite some time in three totally
<br>
different occupations. I got my business card labelled 'journalist'
<br>
today - so now I have to keep them apart from my cards labelled
<br>
'computational neuroscientist'. And that is just the beginning.
