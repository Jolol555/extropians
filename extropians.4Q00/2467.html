<p><em>&gt;I have attained a fairly reasonable level in my career
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(sysadmin/CM) and I'm fairly well-paid.  However, the work does
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very little for me other than bringing in money to pay for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things that I need, but can't provide for myself without the media
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for exchange.  
</em><br>
<p>Already your doing better than 99% of the human race, think
<br>
positive! Don't rely on work to fulfill all your needs, it can't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I've got some money in savings, and I've been working on investing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it slowly to try and get a good nestegg going.  However, it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my savings are growing slower than the cost of living.
</em><br>
<p>Put 10% of everything you make into long term growth, pay yourself
<br>
first! For now, that means a money-market type account. They do
<br>
considerably better than the inflation rate (which is around 3%).
<br>
When you have 3-6 months of living expenses sacked away it's time
<br>
for the next step. Today go to the Motley fool website www.fool.com
<br>
and take their free &quot;Fool School course&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I gre up rural - I know how to take care of things like animals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and plants, and I wouldnt' mind returning to that sort of a life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;partially - not a Luddite hermit like the Unabomber, but a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;techno-hermit, with satellite uplink, computers, generating my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power, taking care of most of my needs without reliance on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outside.  
</em><br>
<p>Good, if that is your dream, you've got to have a dream...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But in the end it comes down to the tyrany of money.  There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;place I can live without either the fear of imminent confiscation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by the latest banana republic despot in the name of &quot;land reform&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or the need to have some sort of steady income to pay the various
</em><br>
<em>&gt;property taxes.  
</em><br>
<p>Be more afraid of the greens, once you start building equity you'll
<br>
start seeing redistribute-the-wealth schemes for what they are,
<br>
people who did other things with their money, and now need yours.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So here is the conundrum.  The land that is inexpensive enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;afford is too far from the places I am capable of finding work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(did I mention I'm a widely-read, hopefully well-spoken high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;school grad?  No college diploma here, unfortunately - and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cuts my options down even more), and the land close enough to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;able to work reasonably is very expensive now, especially for what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be needed for this sort of subsistence, and at the same time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's also prone to the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; property tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt;progression - one farmer sells out to a developer for 50 units,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and they agree to add $5000 per acre in property taxes for new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;schools - after all, they're only paying $500-$1250 at best for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their share, but the farmer next door just got tagged for $500,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more per year, and is forced to sell to a developer, and it goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on and on.
</em><br>
<p>Well, you didn't say where your from, somehow I get the impression
<br>
you're out on the great plains.
<br>
<p>Take a piece of advice from someone who would do things differently
<br>
if he could. In this country, at this time, college is practically
<br>
essential, and make sure part of that education is business
<br>
training.
<br>
<p>Bite the bullet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And my work does very little toward allowing me to pursue the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things I hold most dear - because I have to spend so much o my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time dealing with traffic, and working most of my waking hours to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pay for the house I don't really want and the gas I would like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not have to use to get to and from a job that doesn't really line
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up with my personal interests.  But it's the trap of the moneyed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system.
</em><br>
<p>You can try to fight it, or you can make yourself it's master....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes, I understand a true libertarian society would have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different set of problems, and I could find a place where I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wouldn't have to pay property taxes - but if you can show me a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;true libertarian nation I could move to...
</em><br>
<p>If I knew we'd both be there. ;)
