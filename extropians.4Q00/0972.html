<p>
At CERN (Geneve) the experimental run of the LEP was extended. 
<br>
It was originally planned to conclude LEP's eleven year 
<br>
period of physics research at the end of september, 
<br>
and to begin the complex operations for the installation of 
<br>
the LHC (Large Hadron Collider). However, exciting new results 
<br>
from the LEP experiments justify this change. 
<br>
<p>LEP's main physics aim has been to search for the missing 
<br>
link of the standard model of particle physics: the Higgs boson. 
<br>
The Higgs mechanism is part of the standard model and
<br>
allows particles to have non-zero mass. Its central concept is 
<br>
a field that pervades the whole of space. Particles that interact 
<br>
with the Higgs field have mass, and their masses are determined 
<br>
by the strength of their interaction with the field. The Higgs boson is 
<br>
the particle associated with the oscillation of the Higgs field.
<br>
<p>Excellent work by the CERN teams has allowed the LEP
<br>
accelerator to achieve energies up to 210 GeV, well beyond 
<br>
the original design energy. Significant experimental data started 
<br>
to be accumulated and a number of events compatible (3 standard 
<br>
deviations) with a Higgs boson production with mass around 115 GeV 
<br>
was reported in the results of the LEP experiments. However these
<br>
events are also compatible with originating from other processes. 
<br>
As a consequence it is at present impossible either to confirm the
<br>
existence of a 115 GeV Higgs boson.
