<br>
When Max says the Extropian Principals is a philosophy,
<br>
<em>&gt; or Mike talks about his philosophies about personal right-to-carry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws, these are not the kind of bad philosophy you are describing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But they may still use the word &quot;philosophy&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I'll go along with that. It's just a matter of usage preference.
<br>
You could as easily call the Principles a reasoned doctrine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The same applies to your concept of asking the wrong question.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think any question is bad, only some answers.  If I ask how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phlogiston works, this is not a bad question, as long as the answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is &quot;it is a theoretical substance possessing negative weight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to a theory that has since been proven false.&quot;  Instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quibbling over whether the question is good or bad, I think it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more useful to determine whether the answer is good or bad.
</em><br>
<p>I think it would be most useful to determine if the answer is of any use.
<br>
Of course, if the question is incorrect, then the only useful answer would
<br>
be one that succeeds in showing this wrongness.
<br>
<p>If philosophy is the art of asking the wrong questions, the art of
<br>
answering the wrong questions probably constitutes an allied art. While
<br>
the-art-of-asking-the-wrong-questions is not as wrong as the art of
<br>
priestcraft, I think it's more wrong than
<br>
the-art-of-asking-the-correct-questions, IOW, the scientific method.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
