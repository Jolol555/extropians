<p>Oil production is price-supported - witness the recent release of federal 
<br>
&quot;emergency&quot; stocks to bring the price down just in time for the election. 
<br>
All the federal military strength that goes into policing world oil 
<br>
production has to count for some kind of &quot;support&quot;. The taxes are an 
<br>
attempt at social engineering, and are actually minimal compared to the 
<br>
rest of the world. Don't for a nanosecond think I am approving of either 
<br>
the taxes or the roundabout &quot;price supports&quot;. The free market price would 
<br>
be an interesting thing to see.
