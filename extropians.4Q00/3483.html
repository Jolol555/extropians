This, I think, is EXACTLY what I'm talking about. You are defining force to fit
<br>
your principles, and then telling people they need to use your new definitions
<br>
of old words. Most people do NOT think it is stealing to receive government
<br>
benefits, nor do they think it is initiation of force for government to make you
<br>
pay taxes. If I were wrong, we would not have the government we do, people would
<br>
not allow a system with which they didn't at least partly agree. Telling them
<br>
that they're wrong might convince some, but most will go on as before. As I keep
<br>
saying, there are more of them than us. An important point.

<em>&gt;Well, it wasn't.  And no one has a right to benefits stolen by force from
</em><br>
others.  Ever.
<br>
<p>Right, according to whom? I keep trying to make the point that people are not
<br>
operating from libertarian values, theory, etc. and then violating them. They
<br>
simply do not think libertarian theory is right, they don't value what we do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Will you change there minds by telling them they are right when they are not?
</em><br>
<p>I think I'm getting great examples from you, actually. I keep trying to say that
<br>
a large number of libertarians/extropes come off as know-it-alls, and keep
<br>
people from paying attention to what they're saying. This in turn allows savvy
<br>
members of the more statist political ideologies to get their attention (they
<br>
see what we're doing wrong, and don't do that) and then they play into the
<br>
values voters hold. Not good at all for us. NOT everyone values individual
<br>
freedom 1st, and there's nothing any of us can do about that. And yet, when
<br>
confronted with it, we quote authors no one has ever heard of, beat people over
<br>
the head with theory no one agrees with, tell them it's ok for people to starve
<br>
or sell themselves into slavery, etc.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and I might (I think do) agree that if I earn money by honest means, I
<br>
ought to be able to do with it as I will. Not everyone does, however. There are
<br>
a lot of people who think the government should control a portion of the economy
<br>
(with the largest arguments being over which portions) and should control what
<br>
people may do (pornography, scientific research into controversial areas, smart
<br>
drugs, etc.) I want to live, healthily, for a very long time. If the
<br>
technologies which would enable me to do this aren't ever allowed to be
<br>
developed because the government is listening to people swayed by anti-tech
<br>
ideologues, because they thought I was a smart-ass, what do I get??? The
<br>
satisfaction of being right? Fat lot of good that does you, dead.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The truth is not a matter of numbers.  We are supposed to be a republic not an
</em><br>
unlimited democracy.  Fundamental rights &gt;are supposed to be inviolate by the
<br>
State in this country.  Pragmatic means of living as congruently as possible
<br>
with the &gt;truth do need to take numbers into consideration though.
