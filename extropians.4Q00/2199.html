<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Pesticide creates Parkinson's symptoms in animals
<br>
<p>The pesticide Rotenone, when given to rats, creates the major symptoms of
<br>
Parkinson's disease, a common neurodegenerative disease that effects 1% of
<br>
people over sixty-five.  Parkinson's' symptoms of tremors and rigidity are
<br>
caused by the degeneration of neurons that contain dopamine in the
<br>
substantia nigra of the brain.  The brains of patients with the disease
<br>
have been found to contain microscopic protein deposits called Lewy
<br>
bodies.  In a study to be released in the December 2000 issue of the
<br>
journal Nature Neuroscience, Emory University researchers administered low
<br>
levels of Rotenone intravenously to rats for several weeks.  The
<br>
researchers observed gradual degeneration of dopamine neurons as well as
<br>
structures resembling Lewy bodies.
<br>
<p>Although some cases of Parkinson's disease are genetic, some researchers
<br>
suspect that the disease has an environmental cause.  Rotenone was chosen
<br>
for the study because of its inhibition of the same mitochondrial enzyme
<br>
that is inhibited by the drug MPTP, a drug that was discovered nearly two
<br>
decades ago to cause irreversible Parkinson's disease symptoms in
<br>
intravenous drug users.  Rotenone may create Parkinson's by causing the
<br>
mitochondria, the cells' energy producing organelles, to produce free
<br>
radicals, unstable molecules that have been implicated in a number of
<br>
age-related diseases.
<br>
Because the incidence of Parkinson's disease increases with age, this
<br>
lends credence to the theory that chronic exposure to environmental toxins
<br>
may be a culprit.  Researchers Tim Greenamyre and colleagues stress that
<br>
the study does not prove that Rotenone is the cause of Parkinson's
<br>
disease, but feel that the findings are consistent with the idea that
<br>
cumulative damage to dopamine neurons caused by environmental toxins such
<br>
as pesticices may lead to the disease.
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Stem cells from cadavers
<br>
<p>At the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience held this month, it
<br>
was revealed that brain stem cells can be taken from cadavers and still be
<br>
viable up to more than twenty hours after death. Stem cells are immature
<br>
cells that can grow into many different kinds of adult cells. Fred H Gage
<br>
and colleagues at the Salk Institute in LaJolla, California, used brain
<br>
tissue taken from the cadavers of children and young adults and was able
<br>
to coax some of the cells to divide and differentiate into various nerve
<br>
cells. He was also able to do the same with cells taken from the brain of
<br>
a seventy-two year old man.
<br>
<p>In an abstract presented at the conference, the Salk Institute team
<br>
reported that under ideal conditions, tissue from cadavers could be
<br>
cultured, frozen and later recultured for up to forty population
<br>
doublings, and that cultures could be made from cryogenically preserved
<br>
cells with minimal losses in cell recovery. Because the stem cells were
<br>
still viable at such as great length of time after the death of the
<br>
donors, the researchers believe that these cells may be uniquely resistant
<br>
to postmortem ischemic and oxidative stress.
<br>
<p>The research offers the possibility of solving the moral issue of using
<br>
human fetal tissue to supply stem cells. Current research is also showing
<br>
that stem cells can be derived from skin and bone marrow stem cells.

<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Parkinson's disease
<br>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative central nervous system (CNS)
<br>
disorder characterized by uncontrolled body movements, rigidity, tremor,
<br>
and gait difficulties. The American Parkinson Disease Association
<br>
estimates that one million Americans are affected by the disease. The risk
<br>
for developing PD increases with age, and onset usually occurs at around
<br>
50 years of age or older, although the disease is not unknown in people in
<br>
their 30s and 40s. Parkinson's disease affects men and women equally.
<br>
There are two types of Parkinson's disease: idiopathic PD and secondary
<br>
PD. Idiopathic PD, also known as primary PD, has no known recognizable
<br>
cause; secondary PD may result from trauma, tumor, or cerebrovascular
<br>
disease, or may be drug induced. Patients with both types of PD are
<br>
classified into stages (early, moderate, or advanced) based on the
<br>
progression of disease. There is no known cure for the disease; rather,
<br>
the treatment goal for patients with either form of PD is to control the
<br>
symptoms and provide quality of life.
<br>
<p>Parkinson's disease is actually a group of related CNS disorders caused by
<br>
the destruction of the substantia nigra (pigmented brain cells), which
<br>
produce dopamine (a neurotransmitter). The deficiency of dopamine results
<br>
in the loss of muscle tone and voluntary muscle control seen in PD. Recent
<br>
studies indicate that dopamine deficiencies in other areas of the brain
<br>
and abnormalities of other neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine and
<br>
serotonin, may also contribute to the disease.
<br>
<p>For every decade we live past age 40, we lose an average of about 10% of
<br>
our dopamine-producing brain cells. Once 80% of these brain cells have
<br>
died, Parkinson's disease is often diagnosed. Studies have shown that if
<br>
healthy people take antioxidants throughout most of their lives, their
<br>
risk of acquiring Parkinson's disease is reduced considerably. When
<br>
Parkinson's patients are given vitamin E by itself, however, there is no
<br>
slowdown in disease progression. Since Parkinson's patients have already
<br>
sustained massive damage to crucial brain cells, aggressive multiple
<br>
therapies are required to have a chance of significantly slowing the
<br>
natural progression of the disease.
<br>
<p>Coenzyme Q10, a naturally occurring substance, may help to curb the
<br>
oxidative stress common in Parkinsonism. Other therapies that may provide
<br>
some protection from the loss of cognitive function in certain PD patients
<br>
include the chemical carnitine, Hydergine (a European medication), and
<br>
phosphatidylserine (a phospholipid). Additional therapies that may be
<br>
beneficial in treating the symptoms of PD include DHEA and NADH
<br>
(hormones), and melatonin.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
Vitamin E Powder
<br>
<p>Vitamin E Powder is a good tasting form of vitamin E that can be eaten
<br>
right off the spoon. Contains 50% gelatin. Each teaspoon equals 1,150 IU
<br>
of vitamin E.
<br>
<p>Vitamin E is an antioxidant which can help keep you looking younger by
<br>
retarding cellular aging due to oxidation. It supplies oxygen to the body
<br>
to promote endurance, works with Vitamin-A to protect the lungs from
<br>
pollution, prevents and dissolves blood clots, accelerates healing, helps
<br>
to prevent scar tissue, and lowers the risk of ischemic heart disease.
<br>
Vitamin E capsules are the dry, powder form which does not have the
<br>
potential of turning rancid that vitamin E oil capsules have.

<br>
<p>Super Coenzyme Q10 with tocotrienols
<br>
<p>When CoQ10 is orally administered, it is absorbed through the lymphatic
<br>
canals and distributed throughout the body. Coenzyme Q10 should be taken
<br>
with some form of fat, since absorption through the lymphatic canals is
<br>
greatly enhanced in the presence of dietary fat.
<br>
The new CoQ10 oil capsules contain a standardized tocotrienol extract that
<br>
provides a potent form of vitamin E. Published studies show that
<br>
tocotrienols may be a breakthrough in the prevention and treatment of
<br>
disease, but their high cost has kept many consumers from being able to
<br>
afford them. The Life Extension Buyers' Club has identified a potent
<br>
tocotrienol product made by Carotech that extracts the full rang of
<br>
tocotrienols from palm oil without the use of solvents.
<br>
Unlike rice bran oil tocotrienols, palm oil yields a full spectrum
<br>
tocotrienol complex. Palm oil tocotrienols offer much higher levels of the
<br>
delta and alpha fractions, while providing the same high level of gamma
<br>
tocotrienols as the rice bran derived product. Studies suggest that
<br>
different fractions of tocotrienols combine to provide a variety of health
<br>
benefits and that palm oil tocotrienols are better balanced than rice bran
<br>
oil.

<p>BOOK
<br>
Deprenyl the Antiaging Drug, by Alistair Dow
<br>
<p>This book is about the discovery and benefits of deprenyl.  Research
<br>
indicates that deprenyl is probably even more effective in preventing
<br>
Parkinson's disease than in treating it, and suggests several mechanisms
<br>
of action by which deprenyl can rescue dying neurons.
<br>
<p>There is now evidence that deprenyl may be effective in the treatment of
<br>
many other neurological conditions including multiple sclerosis.  The fact
<br>
that deprenyl, which is an FDA approved drug, is a safe and effective
<br>
therapy for Alzheimer's disease is one of the best kept secrets in
<br>
America.
