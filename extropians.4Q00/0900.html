<em>&gt; The answer, I think, or at least part of it, is that a commitment to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immortality - or a commitment to eventual permanent death - commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defines part of who and what a person is.  I think I can safely assume
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousand, even a billion (or insert whatever big number) years old and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still enjoying life, in whatever form has been obtained at that time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But such is not the case for everyone.  Many people see themselves at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seventy/eighty/whatever and having done everything they want to do,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growing bored and tired of life.  We embrace the infinite, they embrace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the finite, and both sides define their dreams and aspirations around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<p>I can't see getting bored with life.  I could see getting bored with my
<br>
&quot;self&quot; if I wasn't continuously growing, adding new abilities and
<br>
hopefully getting at least a bit wiser.  I think more people get tired
<br>
of seeing themselves as stuck in the same meaningless loops and same
<br>
sorry state of self than get tired of the rest of life.  If I thought I
<br>
would never get any smarter or wiser or any other thing I care about
<br>
than right now and that there was nothing at all to be done about it -
<br>
then no, I would not wish to continue that state indefinitely. 
<br>
Fortunately that is not the case. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps part of what happens to others is that they believe that they
<br>
ARE those limitations irrevocably and that these limits can only be
<br>
escaped by ceasing to be.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unlike the infamous frog in slowly boiling water, there is no gradation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from finite to infinite; even the cocept causes immense future shock.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some individuals can adjust themselves from one to the other, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chances of doing so are greater with greater realization that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary technology - including social technology of mindsets and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forth, to keep coming up with new things to do - is available, but to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force the issue is to ask someone to reject that person's own sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self...so no wonder it is so vigorously and emotionally resisted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, I wouldn't say it is available just yet.  :-)    As for the
<br>
gradation, dunno.  It seems to me to be largely one foot in front of the
<br>
other toward goals you actually care about.  I don't spend a lot of time
<br>
contemplating being infinite or rather, immortal.  Perhaps I should.    
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This is ironic if true.  With all the power that shall be available to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us, the one thing we might desire most - to bring the rest of humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along with us - might be one of the few things that remains impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even for us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>A very intersting question is whether we should allow these folks to
<br>
self-condemn themselves to oblivion once we have the means to keep them
<br>
from dying.  That question will be a lot more than hypothetical real
<br>
soon now.  Which is more inline with our ethics?  What are the ethics
<br>
that come from viewing oneself as an immortal and others as immortal (at
<br>
least in potential)?  I would think that would lead to quite different
<br>
ethical viewpoints than does assumed mortality.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Which leads to a disturbing thought.  What if the Singularity arrives,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the only people who can take advantage of it are those who want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take advantage of it...and, given the extreme rate of change this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entails, only a small fraction of the human race is comfortable making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this change?  The best and brightest, who might otherwise lead the norms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a new era, will - out of pure self-interest if nothing else - join
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us, leaving the masses ignorant, confused, and mostly stagnant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Some would say that this can't be or shouldn't be helped.  I am not so
<br>
sure.
<br>
We don't let children accidentally kill themselves.  Why should we let
<br>
those that have not awakened to their own nature as immortals do
<br>
themselves in in  their slumber?  &quot;We are not responsible&quot;, many would
<br>
say.  But only those who are awake are able to respond to the
<br>
situation.  What should we do?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Previous radical advances, for instance the Industrial Revolution, were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one-off advances, or at least a finite series of major changes, and thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be gradually adopted.  The Singularity promises an eternal state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of flux; one either embraces eternal upgrades and intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expansion, or stays at whatever level one happens to be at and watches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who made the other choice go beyond comprehension.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There may be an infinite number of levels that are interesting enough to
<br>
linger at for longer or shorter times.  What is the use of being
<br>
immortal if one can't spend an eon engaged in whatever one wishes rather
<br>
than always rushing to incorporate every single latest advance?  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I doubt that everyone would leave the relative luddites to their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devices.  Some would seek to exploit them like beasts, while others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would seek to help those who refuse help; neither option seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promise effective aid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No immortal would have much use for the simple labor of unenhanced
<br>
humanity or for their gene pool and certainly not for their raw
<br>
chemicals. So exploitation seems pretty unlikely.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Or is this even a matter of concern?  For our sakes and theirs, should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of us look back on them as no more interesting than the fragments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the eggshell from which we emerged?  Intellectually, this would seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be the safest approach, but instinct and a reading of history say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, whenever there emerges a power discrepancy of that magnitude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the elite and the common, the common act to balance that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discrepancy, with negative consequences for the elite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is a matter of concern from the point of view of simple compassion. 
<br>
I would not consider it &quot;growth&quot; to leave compassion behind.  In the end
<br>
I think you will find that either you have to consider their wishes as
<br>
the delusions of the immature and to some extent do what &quot;is good for
<br>
them&quot; or that you leave the Earth or some similar place to them to make
<br>
their own destiny or that you pop them in a VR where they can safely
<br>
live out their choices (including &quot;death&quot;) until they decide to do
<br>
something different.  
<br>
<p>In the meantime you need to set up the pre-Singularity in such a way
<br>
that everyone benefits economically.  It is really becoming high time we
<br>
wiped poverty, not simple relative poverty but the starving homeless
<br>
kind, off the face of this planet.  It would also help if everyone knew
<br>
they would be taken care of as far as their basic needs and a reasonable
<br>
amount more no matter what.  If you can do that then you don't have to
<br>
worry much about an uprising of the masses while we are still
<br>
vulnerable.  
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt; All of this, though, does lead to an observation of use right now:
</em><br>
when
<br>
<em>&gt; trying to get support for your ideas, don't ask people to change just to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suit your own desires.  The personal decisions of others are personal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and based on their own values - even if they are insane when judged by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your values.  Know what is flexible about someone, or at least what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually flexible about most people, before trying to bend it - and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire for or against immortality (including cryo) is rarely flexible.
</em><br>
<p><p>Most people's value system is in point of fact insane or at least not
<br>
exactly rational.  Hey, it isn't easy to put together a rational,
<br>
coherent value system.  Most western philosophers gave up.  Interesting,
<br>
that.
