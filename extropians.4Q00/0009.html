<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; Spudboy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      It seems, after listening to you for awhile, that you are using a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  somewhat unusual definition of capitalism.  Can you point to any of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  classical capitalist that agree with your definition?  In fact would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  making an attempt to define capitalist as you use it.The people you point to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  seem to be a combination of witch doctors and thugs but not capitalist at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Ron H. &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ron, all I am doing is basically giving you the common descreiption-however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flawed of how captialism is usually described. When Adam Smith was stalking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the earth, I doubt he would have had trouble identifying slavery as being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;capitalist&quot; process. That is the exchange of money for goods and services,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products and commodities. In the case of slavery, it certainly was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business, and a pathologically evil business, but a business never the less.
</em><br>
<p>A business which the framers of the Constitution generally recognised as one that
<br>
was anathema to their ideas (so sayeth Jefferson, Washington, Mason, Franklin,
<br>
Madison, etc.) George Mason, who at the time was the largest landholder and
<br>
slaveowner in Virginia, and was the philosophical father of the other four, and
<br>
wrote the Virginia Bill of Rights (which Jefferson and Madison based our Bill of
<br>
Rights on), refused to sign the Constitution specifically because it retained the
<br>
legality of slavery and did not have a Bill of Rights. He had made statements
<br>
saying that slavery had to end.
<br>
Trade in human lives is not capitalism, and it was the majority of slave owning
<br>
southerners who typically were the most against free market practices. They
<br>
regularly attempted to legislate fixed prices for cotton they supplied to
<br>
northern factories, and when the importation of slaves was abolished, this
<br>
resulted in southern legislators passing the Fugitive Slave Act during Fillmore's
<br>
administration, which enabled the re-enslavement of blacks who even had been
<br>
legally manumitted, and their kidnapping across state lines.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Capitalism by definition is the exchange, sale, barter, or payment of goods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and services, via privately-held property , in order to provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;capitalisation&quot; of these business processes. (pant pant) In the Soviet Union
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can rightly declaim the mass-murders, as you can in Cambodia and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Peoples Republic of China, as the responsibility of the scoialist leadership
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and their many followers. Similarly, the vicissitudes enacted bt the 3rd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reich, or The Confederacy of America, were surely business practices--however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vile they may be.
</em><br>
<p>You still are making claims about the 3rd Reich which you have failed to provide
<br>
any documentation, while I have cited actual eyewitness statements that refute
<br>
your claims. Either come up with something to refute the statements of Speer, et
<br>
al or cease and desist your revisionism.
