Just one comment that I must make when I see Open Source Ubiquity 
<br>
proponents claiming that loss of IP is no big deal:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Software.
</em><br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;software people hurt in the slightest.
</em><br>
<p>It'd be nice to consider those with &quot;non-geek&quot; interests in making 
<br>
such a sweeping generalization.  My mom, for instance, likes to do 
<br>
quilting and has some little program she bought for it.
<br>
<p>Exactly which geeks are going to scratch their itch to make quilting 
<br>
software if they can't make some money off providing the authoring 
<br>
service?
<br>
<p>We've had this massive move toward everyone finding a reason to get a 
<br>
computer and use it in many facets of their lives.  That's a good 
<br>
thing.
<br>
<p>The destruction of IP rights will act to oppose the development of 
<br>
non-geek uses of computers.  That's a bad thing.
<br>
<p>I like open source software.  I contribute to it where I can both 
<br>
with coding and with donations.  It's not the answer to everything, 
<br>
though, and thinking that we should completely eliminate the classic 
<br>
commercial software model is destructive to the overall greater good 
<br>
of making computers used and useful for both the geeks and the moms.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
