standard
<br>
providing a minimum functionality and get people to use it. See Napster.
<br>
<p>However, people will pick up and use a good standard just as

indiscriminately. The question is rather: can you be early enough? 
<br>
Mainstream is a decade away before picking up AR. I'd say we're early 
<br>
enough.
<br>
<p>We're not gas molecules. You can shape the larger scale phenomena by
<br>
knowing the rules, and being early.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (indubitably) superior standard together, in agreements with a zillion

<p>Good standards are written by a single person. Maybe a team of two or 
<br>
three.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; technological superiority will sneak in a minimally interoperable

<p>So you keep the politics out of it. There's not much politics going on
<br>
within a single person's head, unless she's got MP syndrome.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; more room to move. For instance, the big orgs will want to subvert the

and brand it. Sign the source tarballs and the binaries. Patent it to

you, 
<br>
only allowing noncorporate use. There are probably other mechanisms
<br>
<p><em>&gt; extensions to be workable. A solid, locked in, proper standard just makes
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good standards for interoperability only seem to be useful to the weaker
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think the weaker players would dominate the place if they'd realize
<br>
how
<br>
much power concerted action wields. The problem is they're not only
<br>
weak, 
<br>
they're stupid (uncaring). 
<br>
<p>Masses produce nothing, it's the individuals. Has everybody smart sold
