From: &quot;Zero Powers&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:zero_powers@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Privacy%20now%20and%20in%20the%20future&In-Reply-To=&lt;008601c05da2$a786fa60$d2147318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">zero_powers@hotmail.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt; &gt; Someone who prefers powerful information to free information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Implying somehow that free information is less powerful than hidden info?
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily, but rather that the usefulness/value/power of information
<br>
is more important to me than its &quot;freeness.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If so, how?  Why?  Examples please.
</em><br>
<p>Laws of scarcity.  Maybe you think it would be nice if every kid on the
<br>
planet could have a mint copy of Action Comics #1, but you can't argue that
<br>
such a distribution wouldn't destroy an interesting market.
<br>
<p>Further, while there is value in information being known, there is also
<br>
value in secrets-- and information that I know that you do not is often
<br>
consequentially more powerful.
<br>
<p>For instance-- I know the password to my bank account and you do not.  As a
<br>
result of the security afforded by this state of affairs, I decide to store
<br>
my funds in said account.  The password information is now powerful-- it
<br>
grants access to my money.  In the absence of my ability to keep this
<br>
information secret, I will not store my funds in such a manner, and password
<br>
information is suddenly valueless.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Someone who prefers personal empowerment to the empowerment of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; collective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is a &quot;collective&quot; other than a set of &quot;personal&quot; entities?  If
</em><br>
persons
<br>
<em>&gt; as individuals are empowered, doesn't that also simultaneously empower the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collection of those persons?  Or are you saying that empowerment is OK for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you, so long as it isn't available to your peers?
</em><br>
<p>Mm, not really.  Rather, the empowerment is also (equally) available to my
<br>
peers, but independent from my acquistion of it.  We are each free to
<br>
empower ourselves as seperate entities who are possessed of differing
<br>
information matricies-- which are shared and not shared to varying degrees.
<br>
The distinction between individual and collective in this context is
<br>
critical.  And yes, if individuals are empowered, the collective is also
<br>
simultaneously empowered, but that is symptomatic-- the relationship is not
<br>
symetrical.  I see plenty of evidence in practice that individual
<br>
empowerment is the very best way to ensure wide-spread empowerment-- and
<br>
much evidence of mis-guided attempts to empower the collective that often
<br>
does not accrue effectively to the individual.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Someone who believes that maximum power is not found in totally free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to information, since that is a disempowerment of our ability to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information secure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sounds nice.  But isn't that similar to saying that strength is not strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it disempowers our ability to be weak?  Or wealth disempowers our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to be poor?
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely not, except insofar as you believe that weakness and poorness are
<br>
desirable.  Security of information is very desirable.  Unlike you, I do not
<br>
believe the spectrum of information security moves from positive to
<br>
negative, but rather from undesirable extreme to extreme.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Instead, rather, (as in most things) there is a point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of maximum resonance found on the line of tension between the extremes
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this is where the most interesting things happen.  (i.e. Chaos &lt;--&gt;
</em><br>
Order
<br>
<em>&gt; ::
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Complexity)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not sure I follow.  But I think you're saying that if we had all the
</em><br>
answers
<br>
<em>&gt; (i.e. unfettered access to all information) life would be a boring bummer.
</em><br>
<p>That's not really what I'm saying, but I do sort of agree with this
<br>
conclusion.  What I'm really saying is that control over information is
<br>
desirable, as is access to information.  Easily replicating information is
<br>
desirable, as is secure information.  The ability to discover secrets is
<br>
desirable, as is the ability to create them.  Information is powerful, but
<br>
in many cases that power derives from secure ownership (as per my password
<br>
example above, for instance.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps.  But I think we've got a l-o-o-o-o-n-g way to go before we have
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; deal with that problem.  The universe has hidden her secrets quite well
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; we are only beginning now to hammer out the tools that will help us build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tools that will help us ferret out those secrets.
</em><br>
<p>Well, as far as this goes, I happen to believe that we will never know
<br>
everything.  (There will always be another veil.)  Again, in some ways I
<br>
believe that hidden information is very powerful-- I have, for instance,
<br>
argued that we necessarily do not have the ability to understand/manipulate
<br>
all the information of which our intelligence consists, and if we did we
<br>
would no longer be intelligent.
