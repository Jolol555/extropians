</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference in raising the effective IQ.
</em><br>
<p>One approach I keep thinking might make some decent money, at least
<br>
until The Powers That Be start imitating this approach (by which time,
<br>
it would hopefully be more profitable to buy this business rather than
<br>
copy everything inhouse), if someone could pull it off:
<br>
<p>* Come up with designs for a x86-compatible processor and motherboard -
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not necessarily fast, not necessarily Pentium-compatible (386 should
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be sufficient), but two layers at most - and print it on some plastic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a la the printable PC research at MIT.  Emphasis here is that the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;circuit still works even with minor (~ 1 mm) holes and rips.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Possibly use insane amounts of parallel processing (since &quot;chip&quot; real
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;estate is relatively cheap) to help mitigate speed issues brought on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by large feature size (at 100 MHz, even light can only travel 3
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;meters per cycle, counting all the circuit traces would have to go
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;through; if each feature is, say, 2 mm wide, then that's at most
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1500 gates even if one could put them right next to each other, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that's not even accounting for memory latency).
<br>
<p>* Make a vest with a large back pocket to drop the above into, with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;some conducting fibers leading to other pockets for accessories -
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;hard drives, extra memory, keyboard, external display, et cetera.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also have jacks in the collar for speakers/mic that attach to one's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;skull, and for eyeglass monitor.  Put changeable/rechargeable
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;batteries along the seams (with, of course, either warnings to take
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;them out or some way of protecting them when the vest goes in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;wash).
<br>
<p>* Market it as a standard for others to add peripherals and software to,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;probably (at least at first) with a standard set of peripherals and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;software bundled with each unit (but also offering the vest alone when
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it becomes economical to do so).  Perhaps make the chip design open
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;source; make money by servicing the more common variants of the chip
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and by selling the vest and, to those so inclined, the circuit printer
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and circuit design software (the last of which can most likely boil
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;down to a CAD-program-of-choice-to-circuit-printer filter, and ride
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;on existing CAD software; the former might boil down to just special
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ink and plastic for existing inkjet printers).
<br>
<p>Objective: become the Intel of wearables.
