<em>&gt;From the article:
</em><br>
Drug companies can take small comfort in the fact that Hamied might be out
<br>
of business in five years. As a signatory to the World Trade
<br>
Organization's Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
<br>
agreement, India must by 2005 reinstate product patents.
<br>
But by then it may be too late. The noose around the drug companies--from
<br>
public interest groups, the elderly and politicians--can only draw
<br>
tighter. One WTO executive puts the issue in blunt but believable terms:
<br>
&quot;Either the prices give, or the patent system will have to give.&quot;
<br>
<p>The net result of socialist luddite attacks against pharmaceutical
<br>
companies, as I understand it, will be that the pharmaceuticals will shift
<br>
their research and development to drugs like Viagra and Prozac, IOW
<br>
psychoactive drugs that can maintain their high prices. Drug companies
<br>
will have to relinquish development of cures for aging because they can't
<br>
make a profit (due to something called compulsory licensing).
<br>
<p>In the long run, geriatric luddites will die off, thus freeing drug
<br>
companies to recover the cost of anti-aging R&amp;D via the device of
<br>
reinstated patent laws. Anyway, I think the drug companies need to start
<br>
developing drugs that will enable us to merge with AI and Alife. Forget a
<br>
cure for AIDS, let's find a cure for luddite recalcitrance.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
