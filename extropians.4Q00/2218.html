<em>&gt; Okay, we can probably cite an ample number of examples on both sides of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wedlock. As extropy accelerates, will marriage gain or lose adherents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or percentage points? As people live longer and healthier lives it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to me they will tend to include more than one pair-bond, and so they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will extend their families (their significant others) beyond the tenets of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marriage. IOW, the trend toward dissolved marriages will continue (as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has for the last three decades).
</em><br>
<p>It depends on what you mean by marriage.  If you mean &quot;until death do us
<br>
part&quot; then I think that will decline as people acheive longer life-spans
<br>
and eventual immortality as you mentioned.  The until death vow made
<br>
more sense when people were lucky if the lived long enough to see their
<br>
kids marry.  People change and grow apart even when they love each other
<br>
very much.  The all-consuming love is obviously in part a firmware (at
<br>
least) bio-pattern in humans.  Much of the wisdom of managing one's sex
<br>
life and relationships is learning to be careful about fully engaging
<br>
that pattern until one is reasonably sure the person is right.  Most of
<br>
us fail at that all too often because the drives are pretty darn
<br>
strong.  But we will learn, especially over a long life, to tinker with
<br>
such.   I also expect that the forms of love, sex and relationships will
<br>
change, mutate and generate all kinds of new forms as we change
<br>
ourselves and therefore all of our institutions.   Eventually we will
<br>
probably tend to make contracts for specified periods of time and/or
<br>
specified purposes like having and raising kids with options to renew.
