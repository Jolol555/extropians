Hi Extropians,
<br>
<p>I was recently reading _Visions:  How Science Will Revolutionize the 21st
<br>
Century and Beyond_ by Michio Kaku.  It is a pretty good book aout the
<br>
future, written for the layman.  In it however Kaku cruelly tosses aside
<br>
nanotech because it hasn't been done yet (I've written to him about this).
<br>
<p>At the end of the book he questions how 'Beaming Up' - matter transference
<br>
for the purposes of transporting humans over planetary or interstellar
<br>
distances - could possibly be achieved.  Because of his ignorance of
<br>
nanotech, he maintains that this is pretty impossible for many centuries.
<br>
We know better.
<br>
<p>The way I see it, nanotech beaming up is pretty simple . . .
<br>
1.  Place human body into suspension (= no biological activity)
<br>
2.  Note position of all cells/atoms in body.
<br>
3.  Send this info to the reciever
<br>
4.  Build human body to specifications recieved; check as many times as
<br>
desired for accuracy.
<br>
5.  Activate human body.
<br>
<p>There is a single problem with this:  it inadvertantly creates Copies (and
<br>
if the human body being sent is destroyed, thats pretty messy, in a phsycial
<br>
and an ethical sense).
<br>
So you can imagine yourself in the 'Send' chamber, waiting to be transported
<br>
to Gallius IV, and you open your eyes ... to be informed that you are in
<br>
fact still on Earth.  &quot;Sorry 'bout that, but your copy got there!&quot;  This
<br>
can't be right!
<br>
<p>What we want is to have a singular, relatively continuous instance of your
<br>
consciousness in the Universe at a time.  So how about this modified beaming
<br>
up . . .
<br>
<p>1.  Send body as above.
<br>
2.  Keep 'Earth' body in suspension indefinitely (cost can be borne by the
<br>
sent person)  --&gt;  bypasses ethical issue of destroying a sentient being.
<br>
3.  When/if the 'Gallius IV' body wants to come back, get 'Earth' body
<br>
again, and _alter its brain structure_ to contain 'Gallius IV's'
<br>
experiences/consciousness.  Add any new physical changes, such as sex
<br>
changes, muscular enhancements, what have you, and activate the body!
<br>
<p>Voila!  A relatively simple way of taking the ethical issues out of Beaming
<br>
Up via Nanotech.  Criticisms, improvements, comments, if you please.
<br>
<p>LH
