<p>I suspect you're right that the mind has been evolving.  But, of
<br>
course, since we can't see the mind evolving, only the brain and
<br>
behavior, there's no way to know this.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I deny believing that the mind emerged fully formed.  I also
<br>
deny believing the opposite.  I just don't know.
<br>
<p>That's the difference.

<p><em>&gt; &gt;But if the phantom eye is a feeling, a mental object, then you're no

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that there is a recursive, or additional self-referential property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; owned by the illusion of the median eye that is not shared by other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspects/objects  of consciousness, which is that the neurosignature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associates it as being PART of the self, the physical body, rather than as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; externally originating. Muller's principal &amp;c. links particular sensory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signals to the nerve or special sense organ that carries the signal.
</em><br>
<p>Another non-answer.  HOW does the neurosignature associate anything
<br>
with the *phantom* eye, the eye that's not there?  HOW does the eye do
<br>
what you say it does?  You have no answer because the eye is either a
<br>
mental object, in which case it's unobservable, or it's a physical
<br>
&quot;hole,&quot; (or missing physical function) in which case, you can't tell
<br>
me anything about its connection to the mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The feeling of the phantom median eye, unlike visual sensations that go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away when we close our eye, is pervasive and continuous (the archetype
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical &quot;mind/ pineal eye &quot; had no eyelids or muscles of direction). So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have always said that the phantom &quot;eye&quot; is not a separate entity from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;phantom median vision&quot; ..... my theory started as being called Phantom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eye hypothesis, but I changed it to MVT precisely to emphasise that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is important is that &quot;consciousness&quot; or mind is median-vision shaped,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which tells more that median-eye shaped.
</em><br>
<p>After MVT', how could you show that any of this is right?  None of
<br>
this gets into MVT'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about dreaming when the body is paralysed and there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external physical stimuli?
</em><br>
<p>There are no immediate physical stimuli, but the brain is still
<br>
responding to earlier physical stimuli; the brain is completely
<br>
physically determined throughout the dream process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;You're relying on the philosophical parts of MVT to defend this claim;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;these are the very points which I reject.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, I've only sold you on part of the package so far, but think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the conceptual stuff likely follows, even if I haven't yet developed a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious machine on the MVT model, or a telepathy device to check
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for consciousness. There seems no reason in principle why a device
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could not me made that could sit in a shielded room, away from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject looking at playing cards or visual stimuli, and arriving at correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictions of what card the person is thinking of ... quantum physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allows this possibility, as does logic.  Then your points about subjectivity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be rejected.
</em><br>
<p>Arriving at what card the person is focusing on could be done using
<br>
MVT'.  MVT would add that the person is THINKING about that card,
<br>
which you can't show scientifically, can NEVER show scientifically.
<br>
Got a telepathy machine that tells me how and what I feel?  How do you
<br>
know it works correctly, or that it worked at all?  How would you test
<br>
it?  How would we know that we're not just testing for behavior and
<br>
physical phenomena, rather than mental phenomena?
<br>
<p>The mind is unobservable, unverifiable on any physical test, even in
<br>
principle, because no test is available above and beyond a test for
<br>
behavior and physical phenomena.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the contrary, I identify with my primate brethren, and do not think I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have any brain parts that E-1 animals such as cats have. But what value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does your rock analogy have, we are nothing like rocks? You are really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stretching this doubtful &quot;all made of atoms&quot; thing to absurd lengths.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How is a rock intelligent, let alone conscious?
</em><br>
<p>Rocks are like us in that we are both physically determined.  This
<br>
discussion has gone on so long that we're forgetting the context in
<br>
which our quips originated.  ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So you accept that there are non-physical objects, and further accept the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between &quot;hole&quot; and &quot;gap&quot; although both may be indistinguishable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the time of examination? Do you accept that holes are completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PSYCHOLOGICAL (contents of consciousness) and not at all physical?
</em><br>
<p>Ah, no.  Holes are not &quot;objects&quot; at all.  They denote places where
<br>
certain objects aren't, though I'm willing to extend the analogy to
<br>
complex systems which have a missing component or a missing function.
<br>
<p>A hole in the earth is not psychological.  One might be led to think
<br>
so the fact that holes acquire NAMES by virtue of the fact that we
<br>
name them, think about them, and have a psychology in which that is
<br>
possible, but that doesn't make holes psychological entities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I raised the hole point to illustrate that non-physical entities can exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is an analogy between holes and the abstract median eye.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But what is additional regards the median eye is that its FUNCTIONS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well as its form have been lost. There is an abstraction activity in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place of the original median eye input activity .. nature abhors a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vacuum!
</em><br>
<p>Still no explanation.  You don't explain how physical input is
<br>
communicated to the mental eye, though it is obvious how it gets to
<br>
the place where the eye was, and how the absence of a certain function
<br>
is necessary for intelligent behavior.  You don't explain how the eye
<br>
or any other part of the mind influences the world in any way at all,
<br>
though it is obvious how the brain alone performs physical activity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OK, but questioning how I can prove it is not questioning that it is true.
</em><br>
<p>Right, but I'm making a considerably stronger claim than that: I'm
<br>
claiming that MVT is not scientific, whereas MVT' is.  Just as physics
<br>
is scientific whereas the Fairy theory is not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can triangulate, and use evidence from several independent fields
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (physiology, evolutionary, psychological, conceptual/ philosophical &amp;c.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that all point towards MVT as having solved consciousness, but as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have realised, the empirical data alone only makes a probabilistic case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since measurability of subjective experience is (not yet, and maybe never)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible.
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't even make a probabilistic case, except to the extent that
<br>
different philosophical theories &quot;might&quot; be correct.  We sometimes say
<br>
things like &quot;a deontological moral theory *might* be true, but I think
<br>
utilitarianism is probably the right answer,&quot; but we don't mean by
<br>
that the same thing that we mean when we say &quot;These dice *might* come
<br>
up snake eyes, but I think they probably won't.&quot;
<br>
<p>When you're making claims about unobservables, there is no &quot;might&quot; or
<br>
&quot;might not.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This does not make MVT any less true. We must evaluate competing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories and go with our best judgement .... name ANYTHING that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be proven to absolute certainty. Deductive logic and mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proofs rely on the identity statement (1 + 1 or a = a) and so can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denied.
</em><br>
<p>True.  But we don't take it that 1 = 1 or a = a is true on some
<br>
probability or other.  Claims like 1 = 1 or a = a are unverifiable,
<br>
even in principle.  Perhaps this is tolerable because they are
<br>
analytic, but the point remains that we don't ever TEST for them.
<br>
<p>MVT is wildly far from analyticity, so it's just not scientific
<br>
(though MVT' is).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; S&gt; Also, the point with parallel computing is that things happen in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; PARALLEL, not in serial lockstep.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;True, but this can be emulated by a Turing machine: in a given quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of time, it updates the first part, then the second part, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;third part, ... and finally the Nth part.  Then it updates the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;quantum of time, etc.  Thus a Turing machine is functionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;equivalent to any parallel machine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you appealing to the reduction to statistical mechanics when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make this claim? Even if you are, you are still wrong because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parallel brain works in REAL TIME, not in simulation. Furthermore,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the neural computers exhibit graceful degradation and can re-route
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and self repair. The grandmother cell claims have been widely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rejected, memory and information is distributed and associated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight-states, so what experts are you citing to back your claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the mammalian brain resembles a serial computer?
</em><br>
<p>You're right about the real time objection, but the claim that &quot;A is
<br>
functionally equivalent to B&quot; just means that A yields the same
<br>
answers, the same results, as B, not that it does so as fast.  While
<br>
you might call something unconscious if it exhibited intelligent
<br>
behavior at the speed of a glacier, you wouldn't do so if it was only
<br>
marginally slower, and certainly not if it did so as fast as you.
<br>
<p>As for graceful degradation and self-repair, these things can be
<br>
emulated.  Emulated damage can be re-routed and automatically
<br>
repaired by emulated neurons.
<br>
<p>Which means that the important part, the behavior, CAN be emulated.  I
<br>
could have a Turing machine that behaved exactly like you, down to the
<br>
level of giving interesting dream reports.  How would you know it
<br>
wasn't actually dreaming?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Ah, but verbal cues, while they aren't *chemical*, are entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;*physical*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think I have you on the run here. Say the verbal cues are written on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; page ... together with a load of meaningless scribble .... and further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say that you are dreaming of seeing the words. Maybe they are shocking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something like &quot;The Writing is on the Wall&quot; and you wake up, shocked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which part of the verbal cues are physical here?
</em><br>
<p>They happened by virtue of earlier and on-going physical stimuli.
<br>
<p>Just as the weather is completely physically determined, even though
<br>
there is no one-to-one relationship between various important
<br>
meteorological events and their physical causes.
<br>
<p>The brain IS a complex and largely chaotic system, we agree.  But
<br>
still physically determined.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Right.  So: a red-wavelength beam of light hits my eye.  It hits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;red-receptors in my eye, which send electrochemical signals up to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;brain.  How does this signal make me have the conscious sensation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;red?  All I can see it doing is causing more physical activity in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;brain.  The fact that there's no medial eye there doesn't seem to help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;this explanation out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, a key question .... we can see that the original red wavelength
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is translated into action potential signals by the rods and cones so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the information can be carried along the optic nerve. There is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no actual red light anymore, but the end perception is of a red
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light, not of an electrochemical buzz.
</em><br>
<p>Right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The abstract/ illusory sensor (locus of awareness) is the part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the brain made of the same type of information, and allows the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signals to be reintegrated as meaningful experience ...
</em><br>
<p>No it *isn't*.  The phantom eye is NOT a part of the brain.  It's a
<br>
*feeling*.  &quot;Holes&quot; (including missing functions) might be part of the
<br>
brain, but holes aren't feelings.  Holes aren't even LIKE feelings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (1) It is generic, the pineal eye predates special senses and of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the electrochemical medium is the same (generic) whether the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original information is auditory, visual or olfactory.
</em><br>
<p>Irrelevant.  Non-explanatory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (2) I don't like Dennett's Cartesian theatre case, but do think that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceptual space vacated by the old physical sensor(gan) does give a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure for the mass of generic neural information to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpreted against. The TV screen decodes signals (via the aerial/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nerve channel) into a moving picture and sound that can be observed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the viewer ... the phantom median eye provides a virtual screen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (shape and place) to reintegrate experience.
</em><br>
<p>Not an explanation.  HOW does it reintegrate experience?  How does it
<br>
receive any physical input at all?  How, given physical input, does it
<br>
create an experience?
<br>
<p>On a TV, I can explain how purely physical components react to
<br>
electronic signals to affect an electron beam which strikes phosphors,
<br>
which then glow in a manner which is structurally similar to the light
<br>
that struck the camera lens.  You can give me nothing like this as to
<br>
how the median eye does this to light and gives out experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (3) There is a neurocomputational account based on the deep pathways of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the limbic brain associated with median eye data processing in early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information that underlies more recent pathways, for instance in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visual cortex.  Gibson gives a gestalt account of your red light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example ... and would say it actually is seen IN the eyeball .. but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the organism reacts as a whole entity (eg. if the light is a car
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about to hit you, your whole body instinctively takes evasive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action.
</em><br>
<p>Do you see at all what is unsatisfactory about this?  HOW does this
<br>
happen?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Similarly, suppose my consciousness has made a decision.  It wants to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;send a message down to my hand to type the word &quot;red&quot;.  How does this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;signal get to my brain?  Once again, the fact that there's no pineal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;eye doesn't answer the question.  And, not coincidentally, no signal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from my consciousness is necessary: my brain seems to be doing all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;work *already*: that signal from my eye triggered a purely physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;complex system, which sent the message back down to my hand to write
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the word &quot;red.&quot;  How did the consciousness help this process?  Once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;again, the non-existence of the eye doesn't help.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, much background processing is going only unaware to you ... but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have an ability to &quot;focus our mind&quot; or concentrate, and to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions.
</em><br>
<p>Focusing our mind is the easy part.  How do those decisions translate
<br>
into actions?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our ancestors' attention (during reptilian phase) was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unavoidable spotlight of the pineal eye/ median spectral field,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which reacted hormonally in response to light, and the hormones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governed muscle action and behaviour directly. We now act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indirectly, but the attentional &quot;space&quot; or pervasive illusion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self, is where the pineal eye/ median spectral field would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been, the same centres in the brain are activated (I think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reptilian, limbic structures and brain stem, hippocampus and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amygdale and still fundamental in formulating our emotional,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reactive responses to information received).
</em><br>
<p>None of this even BEGINS to answer the question I've asked.  When you
<br>
spout off like this it makes me think that you're just writing to see
<br>
yourself on the screen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I think we can focus in on particular information of importance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ....  rather like the reading head of your Turing machine perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (?) because of this singularity (in Leibnitz' monad sense, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undivided &quot;structure&quot; in the brain) and make Descartes' &quot;sens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communs&quot; out of the chaos, the diverse sense- information ..... an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusion or simulation of the outside world represented on the walls
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our internal cave (Plato) seen by a sense-organ that itself is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusion or hallucination of a structure that no longer juts out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our skull.
</em><br>
<p>So what?  Focusing your mind is not enough.  How does a mental event
<br>
cause a physical event?
<br>
<p>I want to call attention to the fact that this isn't like the way a
<br>
child will ask &quot;Why?&quot; or &quot;How?&quot; to successively fundamental
<br>
explanations.  Rather, you haven't even begun to give me a first-order
<br>
explanation of how red light gives us a red sensation or of how our
<br>
decisions affect the brain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now you can compare your prediction against my somewhat fuller
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer, I hope it is a bit clearer to you, and that you might see where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your Turing notion comes from?
</em><br>
<p>No; your fuller answer didn't answer the question *at all*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Conscious behavior IS a trick of nature.  But what about consciousness?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not sure that I agree with your behaviourist distinction. Consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a clumsy, blanket term, I agree. &quot;Mentation&quot; or &quot;mental events&quot; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not &quot;behaviour&quot; in the same way that having a pee is behaviour. I happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to think that we are in &quot;trance&quot; to some degree or other all of the time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after all, even you seem to accept that we only experience red light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indirectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; via the medium of electrochemical signals, and thus can never know the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world &quot;directly.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this analysis, there isn't any &quot;behaviour&quot;, just awareness of behaviour.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the question is not 'what about consciousness' which is a given, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;what about BEHAVIOUR?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>A common move in arguments of this kind.  But you REALLY don't want to
<br>
commit yourself to positions like this, because you've backed yourself
<br>
into holding a phenomenological theory: that all we're in touch with
<br>
is our sensations and that everything else that isn't a sensation is
<br>
suspect.
<br>
<p>To be a consistent phenomenologist, one ought to be uniformly
<br>
skeptical of the whole scientific enterprise.  Granted, if you give
<br>
scientific statements a strong anti-realist reinterpretation (&quot;when
<br>
you say voltmeter, you mean voltmeter-like sensations...&quot;) you can
<br>
salvage much of science, but even then you still have no explanation
<br>
for the link up between sensations-of-brains and consciousness.  No
<br>
help in providing a link-up.
<br>
<p>Attacking the mind-body problem from the mind side instead of the body
<br>
doesn't help you a bit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;This is like replying to the claim that the earth spins and revolves

<em>&gt; &gt;we attempt to do some scientific inquiry does the correct view come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the foreground.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My experience is shared by most people, and even most philosophers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that I can find not the slightest shred of evidence to support the wild
</em><br>
<em>&gt; epiphenomenalist claim that everything would be EXACTLY the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if no consciousness or feeling had ever happened. You accept this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical extension of your position presumably ... it is standard philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>The evidence is this: mental objects are non-physical, and the world
<br>
is physically closed.  You have yet to even begin to explain how a
<br>
feeling can affect the physical world.  (Sometimes I think you're so
<br>
enamored of technical jargon that you've forgotten how we're supposed
<br>
to be fixing the referents of these terms.)
<br>
<p>Observing physical closure is to look through Galileo's telescope.
<br>
We know the mind is non-physical, and we can see that they can't
<br>
affect the physical world because of this.  One, two, three.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You persist with this belief-desire hypothesis ... there is plenty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of turgid response to this in the literature. Suffice to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (actually replying to your earlier point that I can't dropMVT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of my desire to have that belief ... which I reject because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my desire is to find the TRUE or most true possible answer ... MVT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't a particularly desirable scenario in some ways, I would prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is a benign God who will see me safely through life to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blissful eternal afterlife .... but unfortunately the evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persuades me of MVT and not areligious belief, (sob, weep).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, quite the shame.  So you ARE physically determined, see?
<br>
<p>I've heard the argument that your beliefs have nothing to do with your
<br>
desires, but, if so, then you REALLY aren't in control of them.  And
<br>
maybe that's right.  But either way, you're physically determined.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;It's only &quot;defeatism&quot; if you're giving up on the possible.  Is Godel's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Incompleteness Proof pessimistic about the possibility of designing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;formally complete arithmetic?  No.  It shows that it's impossible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Every optimist should accept &quot;defeatist&quot; arguments of that kind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You must ditch the possible if it contradicts the probable!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Free-will is a much more fruitful stance than determinism, and does allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that many aspects (genetics &amp;c) are determined. Utility must decide here.
</em><br>
<p>Free-will is only &quot;fruitful&quot; to the extent that it doesn't entail
<br>
fatalism.  But determinism doesn't entail fatalism either.
<br>
Determinism also suggests that we might be right about the connection
<br>
between Turing machines and brains, which Cognitive Science
<br>
departments around the world seem to have found, ah, rather fruitful
<br>
indeed!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; S&gt; Perhaps I should develop new and irresistible hypnotic applications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; S&gt; from MVT and enforce belief in it ... would this satisfy you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; This example was deliberately crafted because it underlines the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; pre-eminence of consciousness ... and goes against epiphenomenalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; How do you answer this method of &quot;proving&quot; MVT?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;MVT' may well have some useful applications.  You would not prove MVT,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;but only MVT'.  You still would not show how holes affect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;consciousness, and would not have shown that consciousness can affect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;holes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the sake of argument, I am using a powerful new hypnosis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed from MVT that enforces amnesia if necessary of your qualms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about consciousness (forget holes ... they are for illustrative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purposes only to defeat your physicalist/atomist claim, it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functional abstraction that explains self-referential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness). So assume that my hypnotic suggestion works, just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a thought-experiment, and answer whether or not I have proven MVT to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your satisfaction ... after all, you now believe what I tell you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I tell you it is proved!
</em><br>
<p>Well, of course, if you convince me that way, I will be convinced, and
<br>
satisfied with the answer.  But does the fact that you COULD do this
<br>
satisfy me?  No.  Because you'd be using MVT' to do all of this.  None
<br>
of the philosophical parts are required.
<br>
<p>It'd be like building a space shuttle on the Fairy theory of physics
<br>
and saying: &quot;See?  Fairies really DO dance on the particles!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Progress can march on.  Why, if we never talked about consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;ever again, we'd lose nothing at all.  Intelligence is all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;matters.  Consciousness is a joke.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And sentience, awareness, mentation, mind ....? I agree with you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a point, but if you think that there is only conscious behaviour,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and further think that MVT solves it (animal intelligence or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever you want to call it) then why are you persisting this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dispute?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Look, if you don't believe that there even ARE fairies (but how could
<br>
THAT be?) but you think that the Fairy theory explains everything
<br>
about physics we need, why are you persisting in this dispute?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Because you should take your Fairy theory and get rid of the
<br>
fairies.  Because one theory is scientific and the other is not.&quot;
<br>
<p>Same with MVT and consciousness.
<br>
<p>Anyway, when I'm a good scientist, I'm agnostic about fairies and
<br>
consciousness, and when I'm a philosopher, I believe that fairies and
<br>
consciousness are nonsense, that we have no need of these hypotheses,
<br>
and should therefore reject them.  As a good scientist, you should
<br>
remove the &quot;consciousness&quot; bits from MVT, leaving MVT', since you
<br>
admit that, today at least, you have no evidence at all for it.  As a
<br>
philosopher, you may hold that MVT is right, so long as you concede
<br>
that you make the argument purely on the basis of plausibility
<br>
arguments grounded on controversial intiutions.  But either way, MVT
<br>
should not be considered a &quot;scientific theory of consciousness.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;No, claims can be analysed into parts.  MVT is a compound claim about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;observable facts and unobservable facts.  I accept MVT's observable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;claims and reject MVT's unobservable claims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, I know that there is a weak and strong version of MVT, but if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept all the empirical premises of MVT is is difficult to reject the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions or come up with different ones. Proof positive may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forthcoming, but will it be in your lifetime, and what are you going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe in the meantime?
</em><br>
<p>Isn't the answer obvious?  You say, like a true scientist: &quot;I don't
<br>
know the answer.  There is no evidence.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I accept this except that I think the conclusions about unobservable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parts of MVT do fit the facts well and are not absurd like your fairy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example.
</em><br>
<p>No, but it is unscientific either way.  Saying that maybe we'll be
<br>
able to have evidence for this some day is not to have a scientific
<br>
theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;The illusionary body part isn't there *at all*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It persists as a trace, archetypal (embryonic  even) memory or engram
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and as a phantom or &quot;felt&quot; part of the body matrix.
</em><br>
<p>You've overloaded &quot;illusionary body part.&quot;  We use the term to refer
<br>
to both the feeling of the missing limb, and there's the &quot;hole&quot; where
<br>
the limb was.  These are not the same, though they are linked.  But I
<br>
don't know how.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;that the world of consciousness can interact with non-existent objects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;because consciousness doesn't exist in the first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have an overloading of the word &quot;existence&quot; here. Let us stamp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out mere verbal triviality and stick to the phenomena where possible,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please.
</em><br>
<p>No, it's relevant.  See, the mind can't affect the &quot;holes.&quot;  So it
<br>
can't affect the brain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Yes, but his nerves did the rest, unconsciously.  I rarely think very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hard about breathing, but it's rather complex.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But admitting that your Deep Blue doesn't have nerves or unconscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes undermines your case that human and computer are the same!
</em><br>
<p>Nerves don't matter.  I'm saying that they're alike despite the fact
<br>
that one has nerves but the other doesn't, because, in a few important
<br>
respects, they both act the same way.
<br>
<p>As for unconscious processes...  I just don't know about that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I'm saying that it's a coincidence that programmers were needed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;program Deep Blue while none were needed for Kasparov.  Deep Blue was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;designed by people.  Kasparov looks designed because he evolved.  Deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Blue could have evolved, if the evolutionary pressures went the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;way, but they didn't, so we got us instead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly &quot;they didn't&quot; ... so the two things are entirely different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; types, and you cannot use deep blue as even an analogy for animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, let alone consciousness!
</em><br>
<p>Behavior.  They're alike in *behavior*.  One more complex than the
<br>
other, but otherwise, alike.  They're not alike in origin or
<br>
substrate.  They're alike in behavior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But you have said that consciousness is stupid, and doesn't exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because there is only &quot;conscious behaviour&quot; .. so you cannot put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward a &quot;theory of consciousness&quot; without contradiction.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't want to muddy the point with my anti-realism about
<br>
consciousness because anti-realists about consciousness rule out
<br>
theories of consciousness in one step.
<br>
<p>But I go on to say that even mental realists (who accept physical
<br>
causal closure) must accept a very mysterious epiphenomenalism, unless
<br>
they can provide some means by which the brain interacts with the
<br>
mind, or the mind with the brain.  Indeed, it's obvious that the
<br>
non-physical mind doesn't affect the brain at all: if it did, it'd
<br>
violate causal closure.  As for the brain affecting the mind, while I
<br>
can see no way in which that might happen, I can't show that it
<br>
doesn't happen.  I certainly don't know HOW it would happen.  Thus,
<br>
epiphenomenalism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that computers can't be like us only because even if they had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-referential consciousness it would be DIFFERENT from ours,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because the self they would be aware of would be a (silicon) entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not a human or posthuman entity.
</em><br>
<p>It is a difference, but what difference does that difference make?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also happen to think that self or self-organisation, independent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision-making, is not a feasible concept in a world that is wholly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined. Even you backtracked and allowed that in NLP
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychotherapy an individual could modify their metaprogramming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (degree doesn't really matter, you have breached your deterministic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle in that previous mailing).
</em><br>
<p>No, I haven't at all: that was an argument that, even when you can
<br>
modify your metaprogramming, you are DETERMINED to modify your
<br>
metaprogramming, and thenceforth DETERMINED to follow your new
<br>
(meta)program.  Always following the program, you are determined.
