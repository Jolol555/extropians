<p>I guess it's easier to cling to what you can see, rather than what you
<br>
can't, no matter the potential (probable) error.
<br>
<p>I asked if it was the same thing, because I thought that protein folding
<br>
work in particular was driven by a desire to be able to determine what
<br>
protein, or maybe I should say nano machine, would be created by a
<br>
particular gene sequence. This in turn so that we can know what effect
<br>
changes to the genome will have.
<br>
<p>Isn't this so that we can work out what we want to construct, genetically,
<br>
and then go ahead and do it? I guess that does have other applications than
<br>
building non-biological nanotech. What are the primary motivators for this
<br>
line of research, then?
<br>
<p>Another question... Blue gene, etc, are being built to enable us to get to
<br>
the point where we can code up a gene sequence, then find out what it will
<br>
produce. This may be a dumb question, but don't we want to go the other way?
<br>
Don't we really want to decide what shaped proteins we need, and then run a
<br>
reverse simulation to come up with a sequence which would produce this?
