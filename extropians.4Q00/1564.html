<em>&gt; A French company called &quot;ZERO POLLUTION MOTORS Inc.&quot; apparently has

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; range:  200km (120 miles) for only 30 US cents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         using 300 liters of compressed air  (300 bar)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         10 hours in an urban environment at an average speed of 80km/h.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refill: 4 hours in a 220 V plug at home, 3 min at servicestation compressor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price:  $10,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight: 700 kg
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Max Speed: 130km/h (aprox. 85 miles/h)

<em>&gt; This technology sounds a little to good to be true, but I don't know enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics to be able to se through it easily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it possible to compress enough air and keep it in tanks small enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fit into a car?
</em><br>
<p>Sure, and 300 bar is a lot of air, possibly its in liquid form by then. Venus's
<br>
atmosphere is only 90 bar. I would be worried about the safety of the tank in a
<br>
collision, I think Ralph Nader would either have a field day suing anyone making
<br>
or importing these into the country, or else expose him for his hypocrisy. A
<br>
ruptured tank would likely go off like a bomb. It would also need a battery or
<br>
oil powered heater to keep the air optimally pressurized (as air is used, the
<br>
tank and remaining gas will cool).
<br>
<p>On a related note, I heard recently from some buddies in an R&amp;D outfit that they
<br>
have successfully developed a nitrogen-oxygen propulsion for the USAF which
<br>
scavenges its fuel from the atmosphere, which would obviously result in planes
<br>
needing no fuel...
