<p>
&quot;Spike Jones&quot; done writ:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear to me from your discussion, however that sexual selection cues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are learned behaviors.  Looks to me like most of them are instinctive.
</em><br>
<p>Here's a more formal definition of imprinting, the mechanism which decides human
<br>
sexual orientation:
<br>
Imprinting: a behavioral response which is acquired early in life, is not
<br>
reversible, and is normally released by a certain triggering stimulus or
<br>
situation. The set and setting accompanying one's first sexual feelings is
<br>
forever associated thereafter with sexuality. This association is vulnerable to
<br>
modification and extension, and may become stretched into fetishistic behavior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I had the ability to choose the sexual cues that would turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me on, I would select those that would have secondary benefits,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as overweight and wealthy.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, wouldn't we all. You might want to add &quot;terminally ill&quot; to overweight and
<br>
wealthy. (That really turns me on.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Please dont flame me, just consider the argument: many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; men actually *reduce* their chances of reproductive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; success by our evidently-inborn instinct for liking thin.
</em><br>
<p>No flame here, Spike, but have you noticed that wealthy women tend to be thinner
<br>
than poor women?
<br>

<br>
<p><p><p><p>hash A hash is a unique short-form identifier, a &quot;fingerprint&quot; of something more
<br>
complicated. One simple application is to create a file name that isn't already
<br>
in use -- and also isn't unnecessarily long, since you want a low-dimensional
<br>
search space that can be scanned rapidly. Using the seconds and minutes fields
<br>
of file modification time stamps often suffices for a hash; a document can also
<br>
be hashed by using the least significant bits of a checksum.  Hebbian synapse
<br>
Hebb proposed that a successful synapse is strengthened: &quot;When an axon of cell A
<br>
is near enough [the synaptic cleft hadn't yet been seen in 1949] to excite cell
<br>
B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or
<br>
metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A's efficiency, as
<br>
one of the cells firing B, is increased.&quot;
