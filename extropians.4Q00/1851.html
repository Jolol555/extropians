Another aspect of the reasoning in the paper that bothers me is that the
<br>
notion of regretting past decisions implicitly assumes new information
<br>
that was not present in the past.
<br>
<p>Someone may regret not having saved more in the past.  That would
<br>
make more available in the present.  But if the reason for the extra
<br>
consumption in the past was due to the riskiness of the future, then the
<br>
decision may have been appropriate even though later regret was possible.
<br>
This happens if the risks did not actually occur.
<br>
<p>A person who regrets not having saved more ten years ago would probably
<br>
have a very different view if he is on a plane about to crash.  Then,
<br>
he will be very glad of his past consumption.  In fact, he will wish
<br>
that he had consumed even more, lived life to its fullest, rather than
<br>
saving for a future which, as it happens, will never arise.
<br>
<p>Not only death, but the many other risks I have described can give rise
<br>
to this effect.  It does little good to save if you are paralyzed in
<br>
an accident and unable to enjoy your savings, or if your entire life
<br>
savings are lost due to theft or misfortune.
<br>
<p>When we ask people today to look back and see if they regret having
<br>
consumed in the past (equivalent to asking whether the &quot;past discount
<br>
rate&quot; is less than the reciprocal of the future discount rate they
<br>
adopted back then), we are asking people who got lucky.  From their
<br>
present perspective, they know that none of the risks that they were
<br>
(possibly unconsciously) considering in their past consumption decisions
<br>
actually arose, at least not in the most extreme form.
<br>
<p>It's not right to require reciprocal past-future discounting for time
<br>
consistency, when we are looking at all past people but only a selected
<br>
subset of corresponding future people.  The selection effect occurs
<br>
because we are only asking living people, we are probably only asking
<br>
relatively healthy people, and we are only asking people who have not
<br>
been subject to a devastating economic crash in the past few decades.
