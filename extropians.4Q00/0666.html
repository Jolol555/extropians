<p>Not to get the whole shouting match started again - but HCI has been known 
<br>
to present garbage numbers from time to time. Their avowed purpose is the 
<br>
removal of all privately held weapons, not &quot;handgun control&quot;. I take all 
<br>
their figures with a large block of salt.
<br>
<p>At all the shows I have been to, the &quot;unlicensed&quot; dealers accounted for a 
<br>
small percentage of those present. They had small quantities of weapons, if 
<br>
any - most had accessories and parts, but not complete guns. Those who 
<br>
wanted to sell guns had to abide by all State of Illinois and federal laws. 
<br>
There are enough ATF agents provocateur and snitches out there to make life 
<br>
miserable for anyone cutting corners. Licensed dealers have too much 
<br>
invested to want to risk it all on a few bucks from illegal sales.
<br>
<p>All Illinois waiting periods are also strictly enforced. It's a quick ride 
<br>
to jail if you try to bypass them and get caught.
<br>
<p>Illegal guns sales are rare at gun shows. They are much more likely to 
<br>
happen out of the trunk of a car in an alley somewhere in Chicago - with an 
<br>
off-duty Chicago narc selling. Cops here have been caught selling stuff 
<br>
right out of the evidence lockers.
<br>
<p>Right off HCI's website that you posted:
<br>
<p>&quot;In the deadliest school shooting in United States history, two 17-year-old 
<br>
boys in Littleton, Colorado, procured two shotguns, an assault rifle and a 
<br>
TEC-9 assault pistol and
<br>
shot 26 students, killing 13 of them before turning the guns on themselves. 
<br>
Subsequent investigation by the ATF found that all four of the weapons had 
<br>
passed through the
<br>
hands of unlicensed dealers at gun shows. The Columbine high school 
<br>
shooting is considered to be the &quot;turning point&quot; in mobilizing citizen 
<br>
action against the loopholes in
<br>
current gun laws.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is just a typical distortion. The guns were not &quot;procured&quot; by the two 
<br>
17-year olds - they were bought by a &quot;straw buyer&quot;. The TEC-9, I believe, 
<br>
was sold directly to the boys, and the seller is now in jail for the 
<br>
illegal sale. The fact that the guns &quot;passed through the hands of 
<br>
unlicensed dealers&quot; is irrelevant. Private citizens have a right to buy and 
<br>
sell legal items without being forced to do so through a dealer. Perhaps 
<br>
they SHOULD be required to call the instant check system with the buyer's 
<br>
name - but this would be worthless unless the feds actually start arresting 
<br>
anyone who fails the background check. A true failure means the buyer is 
<br>
prohibited from even ASKING to buy a weapon, and should see the inside of a 
<br>
federal jail cell.
<br>
<p>It still stands that if Colorado allowed concealed carry inside their 
<br>
schools, and if the students had been trained in gun safety, that the 
<br>
tragedy could have been prevented or stopped before the perps finally shot 
<br>
themselves.
<br>
<p>Interesting aside - a local (Colorado) reporter supposedly has information 
<br>
that someone called the local hospital on an official emergency line over 
<br>
an hour before the shooting started - warning them to be ready for &quot;bomb 
<br>
and gunshot&quot; victims. Government conspiracy, anyone?
