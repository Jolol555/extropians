More election news from inside Florida.
<br>
<p>I reported yesterday that there was a 5 minute time limit for voting in Palm
<br>
Beach County, a fact that I have not heard on the national news.  Today, the
<br>
local news added a new bit of information.
<br>
<p>Poll workers today confirmed that people asking for help or asking for a
<br>
second ballot were not given extensions on time.  People who took their time
<br>
allotment before asking for help were not allowed to vote because they ran
<br>
out of time.  People who took their time, voted, and then discovered that
<br>
their card was double-punched were not allowed to get a new ballot because
<br>
they had run out of time.  Many erroneous ballots were knowingly submitted.
<br>
(I wondered how people knew that they punched the wrong hole!)  Poll workers
<br>
say that about 20,000 ballots were discarded because they were
<br>
double-punched, and another 10,000 were discarded because the did not have
<br>
either candidate punched.
<br>
<p>This was legal under the time-limit rule which was approved by both parties
<br>
and lawfully applied.
<br>
<p>Another fun fact:  Write-in votes for Gore or Bush were not counted by the
<br>
computer.  If neither candidate was punched, the card was ignored.
<br>
Apparently many people were so confused about which hole to punch, that they
<br>
used the write-in slot instead.  These extra votes will appear during the
<br>
count by hand.  The count has already added about 800 more votes.  The hand
<br>
count will add even more.
<br>
<p>How can we trust any count if it changes every time?  Wouldn't we want the
<br>
count to remain stable?
