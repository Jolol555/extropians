Anders Sandberg asks,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although lately I have begun to think that wearables may never take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off. If PDAs manage to continue improving their interfaces and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usability, then what is the use of a wearable?
</em><br>
<p>Wearables should take off as soon as:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) you don't look like a poorly designed borg wearing one;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) really good HUDs are out (full resolution, non-occluding);
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) power requirements are so low or tiny batteries so good to make
<br>
it reasonable to have fuller functionality;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) wireless internet is a LOT faster than today;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) reasonable powered voice recognition and interfaces;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) good key and selection input;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) all of the above;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) none of the above.
<br>
<p>The difference between a wearable and a PDA is that the wearable is always
<br>
on, hopefully somewhat context aware (where you are, what you are trying to
<br>
do, what the local telecom/compute resources are), and doesn't require you
<br>
to pull it out or hold it in your hand.  The goal is to get to the point
<br>
where the computer is merely part of you and acts as additional associative
<br>
memory, compute resources, tie in to the e-community and so on.  Eventually
<br>
the PDA becomes a wearable becomes embedded hardware.  Another possible
<br>
solution (or another way of getting part of the goodies) is to embed compute
<br>
resources everywhere along with some means of recognizing the current user
<br>
and pulling in the corresponding context.  This is ubiquitous computing.
<br>
Personally I have too much of a drive to own my own hardware (and hack it
<br>
and its software) to want to go the ubiquitous invisible computing route
<br>
*instead*.
