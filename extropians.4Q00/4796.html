<em>&gt; AFAIK, stockholders own the utilities in CA. Isn't this the case in most

</em><br>
<p>Some utilities in CA are publicly owned, some are government owned.
<br>
Deregulation only applied to the public ones, which are Southern
<br>
California Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and
<br>
Electric.  Municipal utilities like the Los Angeles Department of
<br>
Water and Power were not affected and were allowed to retain their
<br>
plant ownership.  I think the public utilities provide about 70-80%
<br>
of the state's electricity.

<em>&gt;  All the power is being priced by the spot market? That seems strange
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and probably foolish. Businesses that are dependent on commodities like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oil typically insulate themselves from some of the volatility by buying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of their needs under multi-year fixed price contracts.
</em><br>
<p>The California utilities have been prevented from using futures contracts
<br>
(even next-day futures) for more than about 20% of their purchases.
<br>
Most power must be purchased within hours of it being used.  This is
<br>
one of the regulations which is being relaxed to try to get prices down.
<br>
<p>Many of the rules were put into place with expectations that have worked
<br>
out to be the opposite of current conditions.  It was expected that
<br>
deregulation would lower prices, hence rules were established for that
<br>
condition.
<br>
<p>For example, there is a rate freeze in place, which the utilities are
<br>
trying to get lifted.  The reason for this freeze wasn't to protect
<br>
consumers from price increases - it was to protect utilities from
<br>
cutthroat competition hurting their profit margins.  The rate freeze was
<br>
intended to keep consumer prices artificially high.  Utilities were forced
<br>
to divest themselves of oil and gas fired plants, and they argued that
<br>
there should be a rate freeze until they had generated excess profits
<br>
sufficient to pay off their capital investments in those plants.
<br>
<p>Now, as it has happened, the rate freeze is having the opposite effect
<br>
and is generating enormous losses for the utilities, so they want to
<br>
get it lifted.  However the law is clear that the freeze stays in place
<br>
until a certain amount of profits have been generated.  Utilities are
<br>
now arguing that their existing nuclear and hydroelectric plants
<br>
(which they were allowed to retain) have increased in value so much
<br>
due to the electricity crisis, that their balance sheet shows enough
<br>
profits to satisfy the legal requirements and allow the freeze to go.
<br>
Everything is topsy turvy.
<br>
<p>In the case of the spot vs futures markets, the thought was that futures
<br>
markets would lock in higher prices for producers and so would hurt the
<br>
utilities, hence they were required to rely more on the spot market where
<br>
they could take greater advantage of competitive prices.  This seems
<br>
to be poor reasoning even if the prices had worked out that way since
<br>
the utilities have plenty of incentive to adopt profit maximization
<br>
strategies on their own.  It's possible there were other reasons for
<br>
the restriction which I don't understand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The high peak prices don't seem surprising. I would expect market pricing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to offset this by driving down prices during periods of low demand. I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell whether this is actually happening.
</em><br>
<p>Shortly after deregulation it did work, demand was enough lower than
<br>
supply that prices fell.  However demand is growing about 10% a year
<br>
and after the big heat wave this past summer supply has never caught up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  How many independently owned producers are there? I'm aware of 2 large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; publicly traded companies (Calpine and AES). I've heard a rumor that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the production is done by companies with the same parent that handles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the transmission.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I'm sure my information is incomplete, but it sounds like a fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrated industry, but not concentrated enough that end users would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have major problems getting reasonably competitive prices if they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choosing spot market prices.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know the exact figures, but power can be purchased from a wide
<br>
geographical region of North America and I believe there are significant
<br>
numbers of independent plant operators.  I agree that we would expect
<br>
to see competition at this level.  When the state's out there paying
<br>
$1000/MWh (ten times the normal rate) you'd think suppliers would speak
<br>
up and offer it for $500 if they had it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I think even without the environmental regulations, it's easy to imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that companies that until recently have been monopolies would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inadequately predicted the effects of the unusually long economic expansion.
</em><br>
<p>Right, plus the general uncertainty due to the changing legal climate
<br>
made people hold back.  No one wants to build a plant and then have it
<br>
divested, trusting to the good will of the political process to allow
<br>
recouping the lost investment.
