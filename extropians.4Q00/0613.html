<br>
<p>(a long abstract)
<br>
<p>Networks are present in many aspects of everyday life.
<br>
In all these cases, the network properties should be such
<br>
to optimise some cost function, as the number of points
<br>
connected with respect to the length of the web.
<br>
<p>In this paper we analyze the structure of the Internet web.
<br>
The connections between users and providers are studied
<br>
and modeled as branches of a world spanning tree.
<br>
<p>We propose a model based on a stochastic Cayley tree
<br>
which accounts for both qualitative and quantitative
<br>
properties and can be used as a prototype model to
<br>
explore and optimise the characteristics of the system.
<br>
As regards the river basins, for example, striking
<br>
similarities can be noted amongst the river structures
<br>
in all the world. Namely, the interplay between soil
<br>
erosion and drainage network conduces the system towards
<br>
a state where the total gravitational energy that is
<br>
dissipated is minimal. This universality accounts
<br>
for the fact that, regardless the landscape peculiarities,
<br>
the optimal solution to the drainage problem must be the
<br>
same everywhere. So our model is inspired to the theory
<br>
of river networks, which can provide an explanation of
<br>
the fractal properties of the net with respect to
<br>
the optimization of some thermodynamic potential.
<br>
<p>This question is not only of a scientific relevance, but
<br>
it also addresses a very important technological question.
<br>
Namely, which cost function has to be minimised in order
<br>
to improve the net properties both to plan future wiring
<br>
of developing countries and to improve the quality of
<br>
the net connection for countries already connected.
<br>
<p>For network formation, &quot;Nature&quot; often chooses fractal
<br>
structures. Fractal objects introduced by Benoit Mandelbrot
<br>
are characterised by the property of having similar properties
<br>
at all length scales. In this respect they show the same
<br>
complexity at different scales without a characteristic
<br>
scale or size for their structures. These properties are
<br>
defined between a lower and an upper scales which,
<br>
for the present case, are the size of a single node and
<br>
the total world network. It is exactly this scaling property
<br>
that allows animals to survive with a quantity of blood
<br>
much smaller than the solid volume occupied by their body.
<br>
The fractal structure of veins distributes the blood so
<br>
effciently that every cell is reached in a reasonably
<br>
short path with the minimum possible structure.
<br>
This paper addresses the issue of the characterization
<br>
and the design of a rational and optimal web for Internet
<br>
by using the examples present in &quot;Nature&quot; for similar
<br>
structures. 
<br>
<p>It is interesting to measure the density function P(n)
<br>
expressing the probability that a point in the structure
<br>
connects n other points uphill. Such a quantity, also known
<br>
as the drainage area, represents the number of points that
<br>
lie uphill a certain point in the net. As a signature of
<br>
the intrinsic fractal properties of webs this density
<br>
function P(n) for self-similar objects is a power law.
<br>
<p>The fractal scale-free structure of the present web,
<br>
does not guarantee a short number of steps between points,
<br>
but instead shows that the probability of a very long path
<br>
is small, but finite. The natural conclusion is therefore
<br>
that it should be possible to improve the effciency of
<br>
the net by planning a certain number of big links.
<br>
These information highways superimposed on the network
<br>
structure should play the role of the plane transport
<br>
without affecting the local structure.
