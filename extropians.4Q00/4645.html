<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt;At the same time, people's lives are not so different from hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt;years ago, except many more people have automobiles, high technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt;appliances and devices, and medicine, as well as entertainment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  I would agree that people's lives are not so different IN A FUNDAMENTAL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  SENSE from hundreds of years ago. Fundamental problems remain the same and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; fundamental patterns of solution also.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure this is true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  TV:  People sit for hours watching mindless entertainment on TV.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is different.
</em><br>
<p>Do you watch television?  How much television do you watch?  Do you watch it with
<br>
other people?
<br>
<p>Compared to ten years ago, many more people use the Internet in some capacity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.  Information-based Careers:  People develop careers that are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information-based and less labor-based.  That is a major difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That is due to some economic factors, there will always be demand to support many
<br>
labor-based or &quot;blue collar&quot; jobs.  For example, the minimum wage is higher in
<br>
Silicon Valley than South Dakota.  Besides that, whoever cares to be a tradesman
<br>
or craftsman has only less competition.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 3.  Education:  Almost everybody has basic education today.  That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different than in previous centuries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes that's true.  They have an education more based upon written learning and
<br>
abstract expression than those of previous generations, which might have been
<br>
about farming or life at that time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4.  Travel:  Almost everybody works more than 20 miles from their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; home.  This would have been impossible in the days when travel was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not so fast.  Also, most people have been outside their town, their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; county, and their state.  Many have been outside their country.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a major difference from previous centuries where most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population was born, lived, and died in their own home town.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That's a major difference.  Yet, there was the telegraph hundreds of years ago and
<br>
other methods of communication.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5.  Free Time:  We also work less time and have a lot of free time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is a major difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That depends, some do, some don't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 6.  Communications:  Not much can happen in the world without us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowing about it instantly.  No major wars can break out, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assassinations can occur, no major disasters can occur without us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeing it first-hand within minutes or hours of the event.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Harvey Newstrom &lt;HarveyNewstrom.com&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Does the news matter more than it does then?
