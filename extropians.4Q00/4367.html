<p>I first read that and concluded you made the standard misteak of using the
<br>
nasty &quot;be&quot; (&quot;27 meanings, all contra-factual&quot; :-) verb.
<br>
<p>Governments enjoy a power monopoly over a territory ultimately using weaponry.
<br>
I fail to see corporations doing that on their own, except maybe in parts of
<br>
Latin America where U.S. companies have used that technique (with the approval
<br>
of the local fascist government, I might add).
<br>
<p>Those who define governments as corporations make a special version of the
<br>
age-old Thoreau argument on social contracts. Except for people who leave
<br>
one state to become subjects of another I know of nobody having written a
<br>
social contract. How can one allow one's forefathers to write a social contract
<br>
in stone, as it were?
<br>
<p>No. States simply consist of local power monopolies giving some people the
<br>
power over some territory. The &quot;us vs them&quot; syndrome of human behaviour.
<br>
If one idealizes states as corporations, then one should also idealize the
<br>
mafias and mobs of this world as such. Power monopolies can allow themselves
<br>
to make any discrimination against the subjects of their power monopoly.
<br>
<p>One could argue that you wrote about *U.S.* govnerment and that the laws
<br>
(esp. one called &quot;constitution&quot;) allow you to bear arms and theoretically
<br>
overthrow the government in case it goes &quot;bad&quot;. In practice, you can forget
<br>
that pipe dream. You may have your rifles, but when the opposition has a
<br>
much larger arsenal of weapons, technology, and people you lose. Irak had
<br>
a large force (the 4th largest, if memory serves) but lost hard. Why would
<br>
any small group win over the U.S. Government, given those statistics?
<br>
<p>I just wanted to add my USD 0.02 to point out some contradictions in
<br>
your belief system.
