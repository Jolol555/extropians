<em>&gt; My point above is more about whether we should accept all changes than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether a certain change *could* be beneficial. Being born with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cross on your forehead (due to parents having odd religious views)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *could* be beneficial in some circumstances, but most likely not and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would impose quite a bit on the child.
</em><br>
<p>I would not want my child to be born with a cross on his forehead,
<br>
but a religious person might.  I might want my child to be born with a
<br>
nanotech enhanced immune system, but a religious person might not.
<br>
<p>How can we judge these differences of opinion?  Should I simply say I am
<br>
Right and He is Wrong?  Should I take a live and let live attitude, shrug
<br>
and say that each person does as he chooses?  I don't have good answers
<br>
to these questions.
<br>
<p>Quoting Hal:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What about a parent who takes his child into space on some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; irreversible journey (say, a traditional SF generation ship to the stars)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Should children conceived on such a trip be able to sue their parents?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Should the children on the Mayflower have sued their parents for exposing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them to the hardships of the New World?  I don't think we can categorize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such journeys into necessary vs unnecessary risks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isn't this a very different problem? 
</em><br>
<p>It is similar in that we have a parent who is imposing risks and costs on
<br>
their unborn children.  If there is a feedback or compensation system
<br>
by which children can express their rights, wouldn't this arise in
<br>
situations other than genetic modifications?  Forcing a child to grow
<br>
up in a harsh or limited environment should count, shouldn't it?
<br>
