Robin writes, quoting Hal:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The real question is, it seems to me, is would I have been happier over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the course of my life if I had generally saved more for the future ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This is what their remedy would do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question I asked is exactly the right question to ask given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulation in the paper.  If you reject that formulation, then if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to play the formal policy analysis game you are implicitly challenged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to come up with an alternative formulation which supports the alternative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions you favor.
</em><br>
<p>I would favor an approach based on rational discounting.  I argue that
<br>
discounting is rational and appropriate based on future uncertainty.
<br>
Any system which proposes to alter discount rates on philosophical or
<br>
psychological grounds based on our feelings about whether we would alter
<br>
the past would then be seen to be harmful.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately I don't have the time or experience to construct a detailed
<br>
model for this.  Perhaps other researchers have already done so.
<br>
<p>My attempts would be to start with a model where you have consumable
<br>
goods which are like food, things which you have to consume on a regular
<br>
basis but which can be saved into the future.  There are diminishing returns
<br>
on a per-time-unit basis, so it is better, all else being equal, to consume
<br>
equal quantities over time.
<br>
<p>Overall utility U = U(x1) + U(x2), where x1 is quantity consumed in the
<br>
first time period, and x2 is quantity consumed in the second period,
<br>
x1+x2 = constant.  This neglects growth of the stock of goods, but I
<br>
think growth rates may have historically been negligible compared to
<br>
the risk of accidental loss.
<br>
<p>U'(x) is positive, U''(x) is negative, to represent diminishing returns.
<br>
<p>Now it is possible to show that U is maximized with x1=x2.  Presumably
<br>
this is an elementary result.  (This is what I mean by consuming equal
<br>
quantities over time.)
<br>
<p>Now we introduce the risk of loss.  There is a probability p that we
<br>
will not be able to enjoy the goods we have saved into the second period.
<br>
Either it goes bad, is stolen, is lost, we are hurt so we can't consume
<br>
them, or something else goes wrong.
<br>
<p>U = U(x1) + (1-p)*U(x2).
<br>
<p>Now optimizing this, with small p and linear or second order approximations,
<br>
I get that the optimum x is greater than the x1=x2 value by
<br>
<p>delta_x = - p/2 * U'(x1)/U''(x1).
<br>
<p>(Don't rely too heavily on this, my algebra is rusty.)
<br>
<p>The point is, this is positive, since U'' is negative.  Hence we will
<br>
rationally consume more in the first period than in the second.
<br>
<p>With this calculation built into our preferences via generations of
<br>
evolution, it may appear to some that people discount the future as part
<br>
of their psychology, a mere matter of taste.  Actually the discounting
<br>
is fully rational and appropriate in a world of uncertainty.
<br>
<p>The authors' argument does not seem to address the possibility that
<br>
discounting is rational and appropriate.  They view the effect as
<br>
purely psychological or even philosophical.  Discounting the future
<br>
can be modelled as a fully rational process.  Unless they can show that
<br>
discounting the past can have a similar evolutionary basis (an absurdity,
<br>
IMO, since one can't change the past), they are wrong to equate the two
<br>
forms of discounting.  Since that is the whole basis for their analysis,
<br>
I think it is fundamentally misguided.
<br>
<p>Now, given this perspective, I do think there is a possible argument
<br>
for coercing people to discount less.  That would be the claim that
<br>
our intuitions about discounting derived from an era whose properties
<br>
were very different from the modern world.  There was little economic
<br>
growth in those days, while we have rapid growth today.  Population was
<br>
relatively stable, while today it is exploding.  It could be that in our
<br>
world, the optimal strategy calls for less discounting of the future than
<br>
in the primitive world where our instincts developed.  In that case it
<br>
would be proper to try to get people to discount less.
<br>
<p>However this analysis is fundamentally inconsistent with that offered
<br>
in the paper, since this starts from the position that some discounting
<br>
is rational and appropriate.  Nothing in the paper's approach would
<br>
prevent it from being applied even to a mature and stable, primitive
<br>
society which had evolved discount rates that were perfectly attuned
<br>
to the circumstances in which it found itself, for optimum survival.
<br>
The authors would step into that society, and armed with their equations,
<br>
would ruin it.  This in itself demonstrates that their approach is
<br>
fundamentally wrong.
