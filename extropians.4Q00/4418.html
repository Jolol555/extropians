<p>Ha!  Handforged each one and zero, did you?  We only we had ones.  And we
<br>
didn't handforge them, because we had to make our own iron atoms from
<br>
hydrogen.  Some days we didn't even have hydrogen and we had to use
<br>
primordial ylem.  We sent packets by carrier pigeon until all the pigeons
<br>
died of the plague, and then we had to invent fire before we could use
<br>
smoke signals.  And a Babbage Machine, oh, we never even dreamed of a
<br>
Babbage Machine.  We had to use slide rules chipped out of flint and
<br>
Granpa died before his was finished booting up.  Our whole village only
<br>
had one bit of RAM.  It weighed thirty pounds and we had to share it with
<br>
the neighbors.
