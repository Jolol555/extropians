<em>&gt; &gt; Politics as we know them will not exist. Politics as a means of dispute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resolution in a society will likely remain in some form at ever greater levels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of dilution down to more local, individual levels, in one form or another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I really like the sound of that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What can we do to speed the process of making politics nonexistent?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (This sentiment is felt most urgently in an election year.)
</em><br>
<p>Support any candidate that wishes to return authority to more local political
<br>
subdivisions: from federal to state, state to county, county to city, city to
<br>
neighborhood, or any of the above to the individual. Lobby for any bill that
<br>
such legislators sponsor that seeks to to the same, as well as any bill that
<br>
decreases the ability of government to act in secret, without public input or
<br>
oversight, and without accountability.
<br>
<p>A multi layer political system like we have should function to weed out the most
<br>
corrupt individuals, so that the cream rises to the top, so each higher level of
<br>
government should be more transparent, with less ability for an individual to
<br>
take personal advantage. It is far easier to deal with a corrupt politician at
<br>
the local level by bringing higher levels of law enforcement to ensure
<br>
accountability, than to deal with the scum rising to the top with nobody
<br>
watching them or interfering with their peculation.
