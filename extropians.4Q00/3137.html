<em>&gt; Hi Michael,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
snip...
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The criticism I made was merely that Broderick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had not explored enough the psychological and spiritual dimensions of Old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Age. From a Developmetal Psychology perspective the book is sadly lacking -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the more so since so much of what is written is groudbreaking and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prophetic.  Likewise, my thoughts on the topic of old age, immortality etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were not covered to any depth in my review of Broderick's book. Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption that I equate the wisdom of old age only with suffering is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact incorrect.
</em><br>
<p>I understand what you are saying, however, you apparently seem to
<br>
approach the book with the blinders typical of leftist luddites (which I
<br>
thank you for confessing your prejudice about). Framing the longevity
<br>
issue and its science with blithe and tired dismissals like 'western
<br>
materialism' 'capitalist opression' and other dead cliches of the failed
<br>
communist/socialist movements of the past does you no credit, and
<br>
nullifies the validity of your criticism.
<br>
I find it odd that leftists like yourself tirelessly try to delineate
<br>
between the 'natural' characteristics of the natural kingdom while
<br>
separating anything regarding man as 'artificial', and thus not natural.
<br>
If you are to hold to this premise, you cannot conversely claim that man
<br>
'shouldn't' live longer than his 'natural span'. By your own logic, man
<br>
is a creature of artifice. We are self taught, not trapped by instinct,
<br>
and all of civilization is an exercise in letting lamarckian evolution
<br>
supplant darwinian evolution. It should be, therefore, the natural
<br>
consequence that man should seek to, and achieve, victory over death,
<br>
just as he has transcended his natural limits of speed, strength,
<br>
endurance, immunity to disease and sickness, information processing and
<br>
storage, and gravity. Under the philosophy of western liberalism, it is
<br>
accepted that man is a transcendental being, yet modern humanism is
<br>
showing less and less commonality to the liberal tradition, and what is
<br>
the political left has drifted toward primitivist fascism. This has
<br>
resulted in leftist opposition to genetic engineering to feed the hungry
<br>
or cure the sick, space exploration to find new resources or to colonize
<br>
space, or any sort of technological development that is not vetted by
<br>
the star chambers of political correctness as 'appropriate technology'.
<br>
You have forgotten FDR's admonition against fear, and thus betrayed the
<br>
underpinnings of your philosophy yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hence:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While there is something to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; said for confronting one's mortality, the rot of old age does not result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in wisdom, its simply a pain, an impediment, and a source of suffering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that could and should be avoided. Humanists claim to seek to alleviate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suffering in this world, yet they refuse to admit that the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; amount of suffering is from old age. If you claim that wisdom results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from this suffering, then you cannot conversely claim that other sources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of suffering, like child abuse, scholastic, military, gender, religious,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and racial/ethnic hazing and discrimination, police torture and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; imprisonment of criminals, are not all character building activities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that should also be accepted in our all too human world. By opposing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such suffering, you are thus opposed to creating greater wisdom in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world. As this reducto ad absurdum demonstrates, the logic of old age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; related
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suffering producing wisdom is false, or else your whole worldview is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; false. Wisdom comes from experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The peculiar circumstances of late Capitalism's pathologies (as listed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above in your letter) 
</em><br>
<p>I really don't want to get into one more tired debate over capitalism
<br>
versus communism or any of its less completely malignant pathologies. I
<br>
will leave it with the statement that there is no 'pathology' described
<br>
above which has not demonstrated itself to be more malignant under
<br>
communist or socialist sytems, and you will not find any evidence to
<br>
contradict this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; are in no way synonmous with the complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychospiritual, psychosocial and physical changes that come with pre-'Old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Age'. Your logical error is apparently to see all suffering as the same. To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equate old age for example, with child abuse, racism etc. is to mix
</em><br>
<em>&gt; categories to an almost absurd degree and thus to trivialise what is at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue with partisan rhetoric (I assume you're on Damia's side in all this -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct me if I'm wrong).
</em><br>
<p>Pain is pain, is it not? Moreover, as any advocate for the elderly can
<br>
tell you, old age is, in fact, the greatest scourge on our society.
<br>
After some point health care costs nearly double with each additional
<br>
year of life. This drain of resources to maintain an unproductive member
<br>
of society (far in excess of those resources contributed in the past to
<br>
that society, in fact, since the average retiree consumes their lifetime
<br>
Social Security savings in less than 3.5 years) stagnates the ecnonomy,
<br>
retards investment in improving technology to be less stressful on the
<br>
environment, and increases unemployment, illiteracy, child and spouse
<br>
abuse, etc. It is a fair thing to say that the drain on the marginal
<br>
productivity of society caused by old age is the prime cause of the
<br>
difficulty we have found with solving what you categorize as 'capitalist
<br>
pathologies'.
<br>
<p>I consider Damien to be a friend, but I also consider him to be far too
<br>
willing to grant the benefit of the doubt to political persuasions that
<br>
have repeatedly proven themselves to be dependent on defunct concepts of
<br>
zero and negative sum games, and  willing to debase the individual that
<br>
does not serve to their advantage. Damien is a far more tolerant person
<br>
than I.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * You comments are nevertheless very interesting and have made me think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further about the psychospiritual issues/changes etc. which come with old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age  ... though I'm not keen on living for 4,000 years ... just yet. Maybe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, I will eat my words once I reach my 60s ... indeed the old knee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; joints creak a fair bit these days as a 36 year old ... and I forget
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's names a fair bit these days &lt;grins&gt;!!
</em><br>
<p>I'm only 32, but Damien himself is a bit of an oldster himself. He has a
<br>
very significant personal interest in the development of longevity
<br>
treatments in what remains of his lifetime. My only regret is that we
<br>
did not have them in time to save other great SF writers like Heinlein,
<br>
Herbert, and Azimov.
