<em>&gt;  &gt; (Everyone here should take the time to tell us what they mean by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophy in neutral terms before bashing it.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What seems like a definition in neutral terms to one person sounds like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bashing to another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If I say that philosophy is the *art* of asking the wrong questions, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opposed to the *offense* of asking the wrong questions, some people may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(or may not) find that this puts it in unacceptably positive terms.
</em><br>
<p>That is not a definition.  A definition is a test.  If something 
<br>
passes the test, it falls within that category by definition.  If 
<br>
something fails the test, it falls outside that category by 
<br>
definition.  Your &quot;definition&quot; does not offer a test by which to 
<br>
classify things into or out of this category called &quot;philosophy&quot;.
<br>
<p>For a proper definition, you need to expand on what makes a question 
<br>
&quot;wrong&quot;.  You also need to decide if you are really claiming that 
<br>
only philosophy produces &quot;wrong&quot; questions.  If not, then you cannot 
<br>
use this as the definition of philosophy.  It would only be an 
<br>
attribute which is shared with other non-philosophical fields.  A 
<br>
definition must describe what is unique only to philosophy that 
<br>
distinguishes it from fields that are not philosophy.
<br>
<p>What is wrong with a basic dictionary definition of philosophy?  My 
<br>
on-line American Heritage Dictionary of Cultural Literacy gives the 
<br>
definition below. Is this the kind of philosophy that you claim asks 
<br>
the wrong questions?  Or are you refuting a different kind of 
<br>
philosophy?
<br>
<p>________________________________________
<br>
&quot;Philosophy:  A study that attempts to discover the fundamental 
<br>
principles of the sciences, the arts, and the world that the sciences 
<br>
and arts deal with; the word philosophy is from the Greek for ³love 
<br>
of wisdom.² Philosophy has subdisciplines that explore principles of 
<br>
specific areas, such as knowledge ( EPISTEMOLOGY), reasoning ( 
<br>
LOGIC), being in general ( METAPHYSICS), beauty ( AESTHETICS), and 
<br>
human conduct ( ETHICS). Different approaches to philosophy, or to 
<br>
its subdisciplines, are also called philosophies. ( See EPICUREANISM, 
<br>
EXISTENTIALISM, IDEALISM, MATERIALISM, NIHILISM, PRAGMATISM, 
<br>
STOICISM, and UTILITARIANISM.)&quot;
