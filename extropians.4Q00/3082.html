<em>&gt; Wow. Tremendous post. What a perfect example of eactly what we are up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Though I admire the depth of vision and imaginative genius on display in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;this work I have many problems with its philosophical underpinnings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Broderick, and the scientists he discusses, seem to have little conception
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of old age and death as necessary parts of the human life cycle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am stunned almost speechless by the depth of the gulf between his thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ours. When I hear someone who is apparently educated and well-read make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this statement, and realize that the vast majority of humans share his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewpoint, I wonder if we have any real chance to win them over, ever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps the old saying about how new ideas win acceptance--the holders of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea paradigm simply die out, leaving the field open for the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --is completely correct.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't say its completely correct. Don't buy into Kuhnism. Its
<br>
Saberhagen's Law: Fugheads is fugheads. Never underestimate the power of
<br>
human stupidity.
<br>
<p>Now, I read the whole review, and he did try to start off acknowledging
<br>
and illustrating the hypocrisy of his own self confessed luddism, so he
<br>
tries to approach his review as an 'I've got clay feet, where are
<br>
yours?' type of underhanded attack.
