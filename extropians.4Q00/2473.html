</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is why mysticism has power to generate insight.  It 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; practices are necessary to strengthen that part.  Once you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the insight,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than yes, follow it and test it rationally.  But when I go to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought for insight, all I get is a bunch of weighing pros 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and cons and feel
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  I learned ways of centering and seeing more holistically from
<br>
various forms of meditation and mysticism.  The unscientific and
<br>
anti-rational parts of most mystical systems are definitely a problem.  But
<br>
it is not an all or nothing package deal.  There are things in some of these
<br>
systems very much needed and useful in life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; After reading the extropian principles, I understand the need to put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions and insight in their proper place.  However, it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's too much minimization of those too qualities of human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life.  Yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much of human experience and history has been plagued by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unchecked emotion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But let's not reverse the swing in the opposite direction.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see an understanding put forth that expresses a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insight, emotion, and rational as though they were equals, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each with their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own realm of action.  Do any extropians view it this way?
</em><br>
<p><p>Oh yes.  Thank you for bringing it up.  IMHO many extropians get too
<br>
reductionistic in their thinking as the supposed price for rationality and
<br>
scientific objectivity.  I find a lot of assumptions based on the state of
<br>
knowledge today and especially how we came to be through natural selection
<br>
and so on that is mapped forward onto a future where the basis for many of
<br>
those assumptions does not necessarily hold.  In the future selection is
<br>
quite un-natural in that it is to some fairly large degree redefinable by us
<br>
as we redefine ourselves.  We are standing in a place of tremendous
<br>
opportunity to remake ourselves and most of our everyday reality.  It
<br>
requires a lot of suppleness and ability to step outside the box in order to
<br>
take maximum advantage of that opportunity.  The choices are much vaster
<br>
than just a supercharged version of the same basic attitudes and concerns as
<br>
we have now. Design the reality you wish to inhabit and then see how close
<br>
you can come using science and technology.
<br>
<p>Also, as I have mentioned before, I believe changes like going from scarcity
<br>
based economics to abundance and the vastly increased intellectual abilities
<br>
and intercommunication will  change the very bedrock of much of human
<br>
sociology and psychology.  Much of the current ego structure and some of the
<br>
innate drives we have evolved with will need remapping and even in part
<br>
require removal or replacing with more useful tendencies.  Guess what parts
<br>
of humanity has for centuries dealt with stepping outside normal ego
<br>
boundaries and looking at things quite differently?  There is quite a bit to
<br>
be learned from some parts of mysticism.  We would be idiots not to mine it
<br>
where we can.  That we mine it does not mean we step into its quicksands
<br>
cluelessly.
