<p>Funny, I thought price supports kept prices *up*.  Anyway, the &quot;release&quot;
<br>
of federal stocks means the gov't is either selling crude it bought when
<br>
it was cheap (thus turning a profit at the expense of distributors) or
<br>
more likely merely allowing refineries to draw on large volumes of crude
<br>
they've been paid to store at government expense.  Either way, the
<br>
government actions are lowering the price of petroleum products, not
<br>
supporting them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All the federal military strength that goes into policing world oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production has to count for some kind of &quot;support&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>More like a subsidy wich reduces business uncertainty and *lowers*
<br>
prices for the consumer (more than made up for in a higher tax burden,
<br>
of course).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The taxes are an

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I agree with you there- I speculate that overall prices to the consumer
<br>
would be lower, but even more variable than they are now, due to typical
<br>
commdity market fluctuations.
