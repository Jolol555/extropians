<em>&gt; This first point of yours is plainly false. See the Law Merchant.
</em><br>
<p>You misunderstand the point being made here.  Capitalism doesn't
<br>
require the *initiation* of coercion, but it does require coercion
<br>
generally, as did the Lex Mercatoria.  There are some people who think
<br>
that hitting me back after I've hit you is not &quot;really&quot; coercion, but
<br>
it makes much more sense to me to say that it is a case of *justified*
<br>
coercion.  It is &quot;coercion&quot; in this broader sense, under which
<br>
retaliative force is coercion, that Hughes used the word here.
<br>
<p>Now, you may not think that &quot;coercion&quot; entails &quot;governments;&quot; *I*
<br>
certainly don't.  I normally reserve &quot;government&quot; for the INITIATION
<br>
of &quot;coercion.&quot;  But this is just a difference of the meanings of
<br>
words, not a difference in policy, as I'll attempt to justify later in
<br>
this post.
<br>
<p>The point is that, given the capacity to coerce, capitalists
<br>
historically have rarely restricted themselves to non-initiation, but
<br>
have used their forces offensively.  (Of course, this doesn't show
<br>
that they've been worse than non-capitalists.)
<br>
<p>There is a common argument that communists like to make when presented
<br>
with the offensive situation of socialist states.  They say &quot;well,
<br>
REAL communism is anarcho-communism, where everyone is fully
<br>
enlightened and they all just live and share and work together
<br>
communally without any coercion, retaliative or otherwise.
<br>
Russia/China/all-actual-communist-states don't satisfy that
<br>
requirement, so they're not REALLY communist states.&quot;
<br>
<p>We should no more allow that argument to go through than we should
<br>
allow this argument to go through: &quot;It may be true that the US and
<br>
every other 'capitalist' social unit has initiated force, sometimes
<br>
in rather egregious ways, but REAL capitalism is libertarianism/
<br>
anarcho-capitalism, where everyone operates under minimal/market law.
<br>
The US/Britain/all-actual-capitalist states don't satisfy either
<br>
requirement, so they're not REALLY capitalist states.&quot;
<br>
<p>If it turned out that, although capitalism could *logically* exist
<br>
apart from a state, historically realistically it would always form a
<br>
state and that state would be immoral, this might be an effective
<br>
argument against capitalism.  Presuming, of course, there were a more
<br>
moral alternative that was less likely to turn out immoral.
<br>
<p>Lately I've been enamored by an interesting argument: that anarcho-
<br>
capitalism is the current state of affairs, and that the reason we
<br>
have government is because we're suffering from a rather extravagant
<br>
market failure.  It's analogous to Nozick's argument for the
<br>
minimalist state: that anarcho-capitalism would result in a network of
<br>
private judiciaries and law enforcement agencies, but that the network
<br>
of rules which resulted would be laws, and that all the arbitration +
<br>
law enforcement agencies put together would, in fact, be a state.
<br>
<p>You might object: &quot;But you can opt out of a private protection agency,
<br>
and legally start your own; you can't do that under a government!&quot;
<br>
This is true, but you still must consent to arbitration or else you'll
<br>
have to fight for your own laws.  That's just a different way to say
<br>
that you must choose to either consent to the law of the land or stage
<br>
a revolution.  The outcome is exactly equivalent in every way.
<br>
<p>In light of this, I'm not convinced that anarcho-capitalism would, by
<br>
itself, be better for anyone, since this market failure could and
<br>
would just as easily happen again.  The only way it could fail to
<br>
happen would be if people got much much more upset about being
<br>
governed, and decided they wanted freedom a lot more than they do
<br>
today.  Friedman's argument that AC wouldn't break down into
<br>
government requires me to want freedom more than you want to take it
<br>
away from me; while this is true with some freedoms, as far as I can
<br>
tell, a few people want to take away some freedoms a lot more than
<br>
many people want to keep them.  This doesn't logically imply
<br>
government, since, in principle, they could sign away their rights
<br>
while I kept mine pristine, but de facto government results.
<br>
<p>This means that the project of bringing about a libertarian society is
<br>
not per se a political agenda, a list of political changes to make, so
<br>
much as it is a social agenda, a list of priorities which, if everyone
<br>
shared them, a freer, better and more moral society would result.
<br>
<p>Eventually.
