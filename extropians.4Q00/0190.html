<p>Actually, most historians will state that the Soviets did the most to win WWII,
<br>
and that while we certainly helped out, and shortened it by quite a bit, if it
<br>
had just been Germany against the USSR, the soviets would have likely won after
<br>
another five years or so of fighting. 90% of German casualties were on the
<br>
eastern front, and most resources went to fighting it. British firebombing of
<br>
population centers did little, but the US almost had the war won in 1943 during
<br>
their campaign to bomb the ball bearing factories. According to Speer, they
<br>
stopped at one point because they thought that the plants remaining had been
<br>
dispersed to smaller outfits.
