<em>&gt; &gt; Radiation pressure, baby.  It ain't big, but it's real.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought about this long ago, and rejected it. As best I could figure at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time, any minor perturbation of the sphere (such as caused by a major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asteroidal collision) would impart more energy than the restorative force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the solar radiation, although I admit that I didn't take the time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work in out on paper
</em><br>
<p>Can't that be corrected by a seperate mechanism? The dyson sphere is, after
<br>
all, collecting energy. So, couldn't you use some kind of mechanical
<br>
mechanism (duh...) to straighten it out? Or, there must be some way to turn
<br>
a tiny bit of that massive amount of collected energy into precisely focused
<br>
thrust, capable of repositioning elements of the sphere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;. I ended up being more concerned by the total lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravity on the inner edge of the sphere, and decided that that too, needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be solved.
</em><br>
<p>You could place a lot of rings on the inside of the sphere, like baby
<br>
ringworlds. Mount them like ferris-wheels on the inner surface, slightly
<br>
misaligned so that the inner surface of each ring receives some light - just
<br>
the part closest to the &quot;ground&quot; (inner dyson sphere surface. Then, spin all
<br>
the rings. The inner surface of each ring receives light sometimes, and is
<br>
dark sometimes.
<br>
<p>If you pack the surface of the dyson sphere with said rings, there's a *lot*
<br>
of living space, replete with gravity, and light/dark cycles. Not elegant,
<br>
but it could work.
<br>
<p>Or, you could build ring structures external to the sphere, in space, just
<br>
using the sphere to capture all the energy. Transmit it all out in some
<br>
manner (really heavy duty electrical extension lead?), to be used as the
<br>
external ring-dwellers see fit.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Someone may say that radiation forces are puny in the inertial arena.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; agree, but if they're the only forces in play, then they must dominate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Response times are just very long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are only the only forces in play if you have 1) swept the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solar system clear of debris (I admit that this is likely) and 2) can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guarantee that the sun will burn evenly, so that it produces a uniform
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flux. This last point worries me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Again, we are collecting major amounts of energy; why is correction such a
<br>
big problem?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Candidate number two is something of a mystery to me. I know it's there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but I frankly don't know  how it acts on the system or how it compares
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; magnitude of effect to radiation pressure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Magnetic field effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmm. I must admit that I never even *considered* magnetic fields.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I came up with was to spin the sphere so as to cause pseudo-gravity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by centrifical force at the inside equator (and really make it hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; image what substrate would be strong enough to build with). In order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ensure that the inner pseudo-gravity was strictly normal to the surface at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all points, carefully sculpted masses would be added to the rotational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poles, so that the gravity felt on the inside would be the sum of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravitational and centrifical vectors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The upshot of this would be that the dyson sphere would be stable on two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axes, but still unstable along its rotational axis. Its not a total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution, but it does make the problem more managable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Put a spinning dyson sphere inside a larger, spinning ring. They share a
<br>
center, and the outer ring passes over the two rotational poles of the inner
<br>
spinning sphere. Use something to attract the dyson sphere outward to the
<br>
ring at the poles, or maybe all the way around. Maybe magnetism? Somebody
<br>
creative could suggest something.
<br>
<p>Maybe a lot of outer rings (3 place orthogonally to each other, plus more?)
<br>
plus some attractive mechanism, could be used to stabilise the otherwise
<br>
unstable sphere?
