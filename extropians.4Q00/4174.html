Forgot to mention, most of the content is HIGH DEFINITION ... BANDWIDTH hog !
<br>
<p>Plan on mass producing on DVDROM with digital video footage of Federal Way, Washington Police Department harassment footage following charges of RESIST-ING arrest and TRESSPASSing at DejaVu SHOWGIRLS topless nightclub in Federal Way Washington.
<br>
<p>Trial pending...
<br>
<p>Gave DV tape to Watchguard Technologies in downtown Seattle (Paul Allen building)... (<a href="http://www.watchguard.com">http://www.watchguard.com</a>)
<br>
<p>Suggested they add cardiac-monitor bluetooth third-generation cellular digital wallet passport x,y,z tracker to their Virtual Private Networking product line.  Probably won't be centralized database of coordinates: more a TRUST your GROUP type thing.
<br>
<p>They are FREE SPEECH / FREE TRADE advocates, too.  (As well as DejaVu [sent their lawyer a copy of Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do by Peter McWilliams].  He's pretty cool.)...
<br>
<p>Might as well start the new year with a gang bang. :)
<br>
<p>Was a bit tongue-tied and twisted when the cops beat me with a nightstick, tackled me to the floor, put me in a choke hold and nearly broke a joint on my left ring finger.  Got to ride in an ambulance again and go to Harborview again.  Luckily, this time they released me after only a few hours.  They acknowledge that &quot;not speaking&quot; is a right I have, as well as carrying a small electrostatic generator toy (shown on website).
<br>
<p>May not make it home for Christmas.
<br>
<p>Talked with the FBI, DEA and SECRET SERVICE and got tacit approval for smoking pot in my own home (&quot;what you do in your house is your business.  Just be smart about it.&quot;)  That was about the time Clinton told Rolling Stone he favored decriminalization of marijuana.  Fortunate timing, I suppose.
<br>
<p>Thanks to all the droids involved in the puppet show.  They give good herd.
