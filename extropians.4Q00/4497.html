<p>We had it worse.  All you young'uns what came into existence before the
<br>
Big Bang, you keep sayin' the universe started about when you came into
<br>
being.  But you ne'er saw the universe that came before it.  Huge and
<br>
beautiful it was, for a time.  We dragged ourselves up from the
<br>
primodial muck into utopias that defied the distance between galaxies.
<br>
We kept upgradin' and upgradin' ourselves, confident that if we kept
<br>
doin' so, nothin' could possibly tear us down.  Until somethin' did.
<br>
<p>Our universe caved in on itself.  Some'f us had lived o'er a trillion
<br>
years, others were born more recently, but it didn' matter.  All of us
<br>
just wan'ed to keep livin', but the universe, no, she wouldna let us.
<br>
Everythin' kept collapsin' closer and closer together, further an'
<br>
further an' faster an' faster.  Let me tell ya, there ain't nothing so
<br>
depressin' as an immortal who ain't immortal no more.  Ain't nothin'
<br>
more determined, neither.  People kept tryin' to find ways around it,
<br>
and ya kept hearin' rumors that some groups found a way into other
<br>
dimensions or kicked themselves ahead past the Big Crunch or somethin',
<br>
but ya never heard directly from any of 'em.  The population of the
<br>
universe *did* seem t' be gettin' smaller every day, though.
<br>
<p>And then, one day, *BANG*!  Everythin' you worked for, everythin' you
<br>
built up, all gone forever.  E'en I didn't survive; 'twas only a cosmic
<br>
joke that when the Big Bang was done scatterin' my atoms hither an'
<br>
yon, they wound up back together.  Or maybe that last-ditch device by
<br>
that Omega guy paid off after all...not that I've seen 'im this side of
<br>
the Universal Restart.  But I could tell you about wonders, kids,
<br>
wonders that I'll always remember losin'.
