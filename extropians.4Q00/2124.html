<p>Karl A. Thiel reports,
<br>
&lt;&lt;Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, director of the Computational Neurobiology
<br>
Laboratory at the Salk Institute, agrees that the properties of the brain
<br>
can likely be duplicated in artificial devices, although he regards
<br>
questions of consciousness with a decidedly unphilosophical bent of mind.
<br>
&quot;My own suspicion is that words like 'consciousness' and 'qualia' will go
<br>
the way of words like 'phlogiston and 'vitalism.'&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Dr. Sejnowski has also written:

<br>
Is the Cerebral Cortex a Time Machine?
<br>
&quot;The cerebral cortex contains around 100,000,000,000 neurons and 95% of
<br>
the 1,000,000,000,000,000 synapses in the cortex are local connections
<br>
between neighboring neurons. Recent discoveries about intrinsic properties
<br>
of cortical neurons suggest that they are capable of computing with single
<br>
spikes on a much faster time scale than previously thought possible. I
<br>
will show that fast recurrent cortical networks may implement a temporal
<br>
difference learning algorithm that allows predictions to be made about
<br>
future states of the world.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hmmm.... consciousness, mind, soul, god, etc., are all phlogiston (OK,
<br>
I'll go along with that), and cortical neurons can predict &quot;future states
<br>
of the world.&quot; Love is not exactly phlogiston, it's &quot; ...a surge in
<br>
activity in my anterior cingulate cortex, middle insula and in parts of my
<br>
putamen and caudate nucleus.&quot; All right, but &quot;subconscious computation&quot;
<br>
still has meaning according to Sejnowski:

** How does consciousness relate to subconsciousness?
<br>
Consciousness is like the tip of an iceberg; although it is the most
<br>
visible, it represents a small fraction of all the computational work that
<br>
goes on in the subconscious, which is below the level of our awareness.
<br>
** Which is more important to our survival as a species?
<br>
Without the subconscious computation in the brain we would not be able to
<br>
do anything. Consciousness is a nice luxury. .
<br>
<p>How 'bout self-awareness? Phlogiston?
