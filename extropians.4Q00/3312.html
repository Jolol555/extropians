<p><p>New Mexico is often excepted as the lone &quot;non-western&quot; western

state.  Despite its rural population and geographical location, New Mexico

is populated by large quantities of government dependent peoples and

metropolitan aristocrats playing cowboy.  As a result, its politics are far 
<br>
more Democrat oriented (both in politics and nature) than Arizona, Nevada, 
<br>
etc as it has lots of government social welfare programs, semi-restrictive 
<br>
gun laws, and a relatively high tax burden.  Of course, a lot of this has 
<br>
to do with New Mexico being one giant Indian reservation (most Indian 
<br>
reservations are pretty anti-gun in most parts of the country).
