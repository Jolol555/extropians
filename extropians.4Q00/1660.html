<p>Joe, Joe, Joe!
<br>
<p>The MMM is NOT, repeat, NOT, the simple brainchild of a concerned mother. 
<br>
Check out Donna Dees-Thomases credentials. She is NOT just a worried 
<br>
housewife - she is best friends with Hillary and Bill (or one of her 
<br>
relatives is) and she works as a press secretary for people like Dan 
<br>
Rather. Hardly an innocent. Do the words &quot;politically connected&quot; ring a bell?
<br>
<p>A majority of the populace? The numbers speak for themselves. Nationwide, 
<br>
they have about 250,000 show up to the Mother's Day rally. The press 
<br>
inflated the numbers to 750,000. Many participants interviewed stated that 
<br>
they came to see what the fuss was about, not because they supported the 
<br>
MMM. The MMM publicly stated a month or so back that they had &quot;30 chapters, 
<br>
each with at least 20 members&quot; nationwide, and that they were expecting a 
<br>
few &quot;hundred&quot; more. A check of the leaders of the MMM chapters turns up the 
<br>
same -male- name as the leader of many of them. Obviously, they do not have 
<br>
a majority even of women supporting them as members.
<br>
<p>The Northbrook, Illinois chapter of the MMM, run by a man, boasts four (4) 
<br>
members in a town of over 30,000. At a recent hearing on banning handguns 
<br>
in Northbrook, they had three speakers for a ban versus about 50 against 
<br>
any more &quot;gun control&quot;.
<br>
<p>The MMM, for all its' grass-rootedness, has anonymous donors who sent 
<br>
multi-million dollar checks. Corporate sponsors. Ex-Secret Service agents 
<br>
as &quot;security advisers&quot;. Pre-printed, professionally designed literature, 
<br>
banners, buttons, flags, and whatnot. This is a packaged, manufactured 
<br>
movement trying to disguise itself as &quot;grassroots&quot;.
<br>
<p>The NRA, on the other hand, receives most of its' operating budget from 
<br>
its' members, like myself and almost four million other Americans.
<br>
<p>The MMM's tax-exempt status came under fire, as they were supposedly not 
<br>
allowed to be politically active under their original charter. They 
<br>
switched tax horses quickly when this was pointed out. There has been no 
<br>
official probe, that I have heard of, into this breaking of tax laws. If 
<br>
this had been a pro-rights group that had pulled the same stunt, I have no 
<br>
doubt that the IRS and Janet Reno would be all over them.
<br>
<p>Are you any relation to Ms. Dees-Thomases, by the way?
<br>
<p>Handgun Control, Inc. has publicly stated more than once that the ultimate 
<br>
goal is removal of all privately held weapons. Dianne Feinstein and Charles 
<br>
Schumer have said said the same numerous times. It is a public front that 
<br>
the anti-gunners use to gull the undecided into thinking that the 
<br>
&quot;reasonable&quot; gun control is all they want. The registration or banning of 
<br>
handguns is just a first step. The anti-gunners want to nibble the 
<br>
Constitution to death, as it is inconvenient to have to put up with free 
<br>
speech, getting warrants for searches, etc. They just want to trash the 
<br>
works - and unless they can disarm the public, they can't succeed with the 
<br>
rest of the agenda.
<br>
<p>The &quot;lie&quot; that IS a lie, is that they would get &quot;all&quot; the guns out. They 
<br>
would not try to disarm the police, or the military - those functions are 
<br>
required to maintain order over the other group who will never be disarmed 
<br>
- the criminals. Obviously, it is physically impossible to rid the country 
<br>
of guns, and it will also be physically impossible to enforce &quot;gun control&quot; 
<br>
to the point where the bad guys cannot get weapons.
<br>
<p>Anyone who buys into the myth that &quot;gun control&quot; is either necessary or 
<br>
will result in less than the total destruction of the Second Amendment in 
<br>
the US is living in a dream world.
<br>
<p>You are right - it IS a &quot;War On Responsible Gun Ownership&quot; and it is being 
<br>
run by some of the same people who are responsible for the War On (some) 
<br>
Drugs. It seems that sometimes the WOD is being used as a lever to further 
<br>
the War on Guns.
<br>
<p>Finally, if someone can show me a method that keeps the guns out of the 
<br>
wacko's hands WITHOUT destroying my right (and your right) to defend 
<br>
ourselves, I would like to hear about it. So far, all the present laws have 
<br>
done is restrict my options, reduce my safety and waste my time.
<br>
<p>I have taken enough Extropian bandwidth on this subject. From here on, if 
<br>
you want to continue the argument, please meet me at 
<br>
exi-freedom@egroups.com. I promise not to post on this subject again unless 
<br>
there is a discussion that seems less like hitting my head against a brick 
<br>
wall.
