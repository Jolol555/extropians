<em>&gt;From this weeks Nature:
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicine: Cardiac arrest can be less of a gamble
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TIM LINCOLN
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no good place to suffer cardiac arrest. But if you do, a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hospital is obviously one location where quick treatment is likely
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to increase the chances of recovery. As described in two papers in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New England Journal of Medicine, certain casinos in Nevada and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mississippi, and some airlines, also make recovery a better bet.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The type of cardiac arrest concerned is that caused by ventricular
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fibrillation, in which contraction of heart-muscle fibres becomes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uncoordinated. The key to treatment is the use of defibrillating
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equipment, and swiftly: with each minute that passes, the possibility
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of recovery falls rapidly.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T. D. Valenzuela et al. (N. Engl. J. Med. 343, 1206-1209; 2000) report
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the results of a programme in which defibrillators were installed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in casinos and security staff were trained to use them. The overall
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;success rate, judged by a patient's eventual discharge from hospital,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was 53%. The national average is just 5%.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other study (R. L. Page et al. 343, 1210-1216; 2000) involved
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American Airlines.  Like some other aircraft operators, American
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Airlines has introduced defibrillators on its planes and trained
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flight attendants to use them. Here the rate of survival was 40%,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which compares well even with the rates achieved by quick-response
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emergency services in other circumstances. The authors calculate that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if all commercial aircraft carried the equipment, 93 people would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;survive who would otherwise have died each year.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authors also point to a study showing that age need not be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a barrier to the effective use of defibrillators. Twelve-year-old
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children took only 27 seconds longer to carry out defibrillation than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;medical personnel, albeit in simulations.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps a safer approach is to avoid flying or gambling
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;altogether. Cardiac arrest is more common in these situations than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in most other public places - although, in the case of casinos,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is not clear whether the
