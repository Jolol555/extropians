<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently pondered on the origins of the English language, I was 
<br>
thinking about the international space station but somehow went off on a 
<br>
tangent.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering why English on first sight, has many differences from 
<br>
most other languages. Such as the lack of genderised words when descibing an 
<br>
object or  &quot;Black Cat&quot; as opposed to &quot;Cat Black&quot; in most other languages. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does English not follow the same rules as the languages that have 
<br>
influenced its evolution, such as German, French and Italian ?. I would have 
<br>
thought that as England was conquered by The Saxons, Normans and Romans. That 
<br>
thier basic rules of language would have been enforced on the Ancient 
<br>
Britons. Maybe they were too simple to grasp the concepts ?. ;o) (not sure 
<br>
about German, My Duetch isn't too hot)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard that all languages stem from an ancient very basic language 
<br>
&quot;Ancient Nostratic&quot; ?? . Could it be that Britain was somehow seperate from 
<br>
this evolving language and formed its own with a slightly different viewpoint 
<br>
from the rest ?.    The only way I can see an solution to this, is if the 
<br>
English language was originally concieved by Neaderthals or another group of 
<br>
ancient homanids living mainly around the British Isles.  Possible ?, I 
<br>
soppose so, but maybe a bit far fetched. It would make more sense if many 
<br>
northern European languages were the same.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im sure someone has an explantion or at least some better theories than 
<br>
my half baked ideas thought up in tens minutes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a quick idea about &quot;black Cat&quot;, &quot;Cat Black&quot;. If I were an ancient 
<br>
Human and I wanted to direct attention to an object. Saying &quot;Cat Black&quot; makes 
<br>
more sense. It imediatly directs you to the object and then enforces 
<br>
recognition with specifics. Where as &quot;Black Cat&quot; puts emphasis on the Black, 
<br>
which could be any number of objects in your field of view. Then the 
<br>
definition of the object I want you to look at.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would that not mean that the &quot;Inventers&quot; of the language rules placed a 
<br>
high value on abstacts such as colour ?.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe food for thought, It could explain why the Neaderthals died out. 
<br>
Bob watch out for that brown, large, fury, warm-blooded, saber-toothed 
<br>
....oops to late.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex.
