<p>Nanotechnology, organics advance toward IEDM

<br>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO - Advances in nanotechnology and organic electronics
<br>
will complement mainstream silicon process developments at the
<br>
International Electron Devices Meeting Dec. 11-13.
<br>
<p>A team from Japan's NTT research laboratories has gone beyond the
<br>
realm of single-transistor devices to build the first elemental
<br>
circuit using single-electron transistors. The team fabricated the
<br>
circuit using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) process and a vertical
<br>
pattern-dependent oxidation technique. When operating at 25 K, the
<br>
circuit performed basic arithmetic calculations.
<br>
<p>Nanotechnology is also being applied to nonvolatile memory devices,
<br>
where nanocrystals on a floating gate are used in place of capacitors
<br>
to store the charge. A research team at Lucent Technologies has used
<br>
an aerosol-based technique to deposit and integrate a thin, uniform
<br>
layer of nanocrystals in the gate dielectric of 200-nanometer
<br>
MOSFETs. The 3-nm-diameter spherical nanocrystals were fabricated from
<br>
diluted silane, heated to 950 degrees C.
<br>
<p>Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley are scheduled
<br>
to report at the San Francisco meeting on what they say is the
<br>
smallest transistor gate ever built: 20 nm, with an ultrathin,
<br>
140-angstrom silicon-on-insulator layer. The researchers overcame the
<br>
unwanted series resistance often encountered in thin layers of SOI by
<br>
optimizing the silicide process step on the transistor's contacts. The
<br>
work is one more indication of how SOI is being applied to mainstream
<br>
use.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, in the race for speedy transistors, Hitachi Ltd.
<br>
researchers claim to have built the fastest silicon-based bipolar
<br>
transistor, operating at 180 GHz with an ECL gate delay of 6.7
<br>
picoseconds. The self-aligned, 200-nm transistor was built using
<br>
silicon germanium and is compatible with standard CMOS
<br>
architectures. It is said to be the first transistor built in this
<br>
high-resistance material to incorporate passive components - a
<br>
capacitor and a high-Q inductor.
<br>
<p>A team from Canada's Simon Fraser University will detail an
<br>
indium-phosphide-based double-bipolar-transistor heterostructure fast
<br>
enough to be used with 40-Gbit/second fiber-optic systems. The
<br>
researchers claim to have overcome a collector-blocking effect that
<br>
has been the bane of base-collector heterojunction designs for
<br>
years. The devices achieve a peak cutoff frequency of 250 GHz, claimed
<br>
to be the fastest to date for a double heterostructure design.
<br>
<p>Transistors via ink-jet
<br>
<p>Finally, researchers at Cambridge University will describe the
<br>
production of all-polymer thin-film transistors using a
<br>
high-resolution ink-jet printer, a first for that production process.
<br>
While ink-jet techniques have been used to build polymer LEDs and
<br>
large, flexible displays, they have not been applied to manufacture
<br>
transistors. Cambridge researchers used a piezoelectric ink-jet print
<br>
head to build the transistors with a channel length of 5 micrometers
<br>
and a patterned gate electrode.  The devices showed on/off current
<br>
ratios exceeding 105 and electron mobilities of 0.02 cm squared/Vs,
<br>
adequate for many electronics applications.
<br>
<p>A panel discussion will consider what technologies will take the
<br>
industry past the 40-Gbit/s range. Other panels will focus on
<br>
alternative memory architectures and single-electron transistors.
