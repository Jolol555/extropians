I read this paper from beginning to end in one sitting, though I don't
<br>
pretend
<br>
to understand it.  I got the gist of it though, and figure somewhere in my
<br>
subconscious mind there are little neural networks making sense of the bits
<br>
and
<br>
pieces that were incomprehensible.  If you read it, do yourself a favor,
<br>
read
<br>
every word, comma, and period, in order, from beginning to end, whether it
<br>
makes
<br>
sense or not.  Ultimately, the pieces will fall together.

<p>The Molecular Repair of the Brain
<br>
<a href="http://www.merkle.com/cryo/techFeas.html">http://www.merkle.com/cryo/techFeas.html</a>
<br>
This paper considers the limits of what medical technology should eventually
<br>
be able to achieve (based on the currently understood laws of chemistry and
<br>
physics) and the kinds of damage caused by current methods of freezing. It
<br>
then considers whether methods of repairing the kinds of damage caused by
<br>
current suspension techniques are likely to be achieved in the future.

<p>Hi Ken,
<br>
<p>Nice art, and lots of it, thanks.
<br>
<p>I read enough of Merkle's paper to persuade me that there are some people
<br>
determined to extend human life via cryogenic technology. I think they'll
<br>
succeed. To the extent that they fail, they will be motivated to greater
<br>
effort; and to the extent that they succeed, they will have more time to
<br>
work on it. People, especially elite people, will need to consider which
<br>
path leads to the longest life: cyborganization, cryogenics, digital
<br>
copying, cloning, gene mutation, bionics, symbiotics, and so on. Synthetic
<br>
sentience (potentially immortal and presently evolvable) may make molecular
<br>
brain repair obsolete and irrelevant by making us all into droids involved
<br>
in the puppet show.  They give good herd.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.

&nbsp;I think I'd add &quot;free will&quot; to the list of &quot;consciousness&quot; &quot;phlogiston&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;vitalism&quot; and &quot;mind&quot; as examples of useless hypotheses.
