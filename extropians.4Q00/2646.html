<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
B Vitamins improve vascular function
<br>
<p>In this week's issue of Circulation, Journal of the American Heart
<br>
Association, it was reported that B vitamins folic acid and vitamin B12
<br>
improve vascular function, most likely through the mechanism of lowering
<br>
homocysteine.  Elevated homocysteine is a known risk factor in
<br>
cardiovascular disease yet it was unknown what effect lowering
<br>
homocysteine would have on endothelial function.  The endothelium is the
<br>
layer of cells that lines the blood vessels that is effected in coronary
<br>
artery patients. The study included eighty-nine men with coronary heart
<br>
disease who had no history of a coronary event for the preceding three
<br>
months.  The men were randomized into two groups, one who received 1 mg
<br>
vitamin B12 and 5 mg folic acid per day, the other, a placebo.  Vascular
<br>
endothelial function was measured before and eight weeks after treatment,
<br>
as well as serum folate and B12 levels, total plasma homocysteine and free
<br>
(unbound) plasma homocysteine.
<br>
<p>While at the beginning of the study endothelial function as measured by
<br>
flow-mediated dilatation was the same in both groups, it was significantly
<br>
improved in the group receiving the vitamins after eight weeks.  This
<br>
group also experienced a drop in total plasma homocysteine as well as free
<br>
homocysteine along with the expected rise in serum levels of vitamins B12
<br>
and folic acid.  The authors suggest that improvement in endothelial
<br>
function is not due to a direct effect of the vitamins on the endothelium,
<br>
but to the increased availability of nitric oxide that occurs with lower
<br>
free homocysteine levels, as free homocysteine inactivates nitric oxide.
<br>
They state that the results of this study indicate that free homocysteine
<br>
is a more accurate index of the biological activity of homocysteine in the
<br>
body  than bound homocysteine.
<br>
<p>The study's authors note that the doses used in the study were selected to
<br>
provide maximal homocysteine reduction, but doses as low as 400 mcg folic
<br>
acid per day have been shown to lower homocysteine.  They consclude that
<br>
these results provide direct evidence that supplementation with B vitamins
<br>
may reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with atherosclerosis.
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Homocysteine
<br>
<p>Cardiovascular disease causes 44% of all deaths in the United States.
<br>
Alzheimer's dementia affects 4 million Americans now, and is expected to
<br>
increase sharply as the population ages. Both cardiovascular and
<br>
Alzheimer's disease have now been linked to the accumulation of a toxic
<br>
amino acid called homocysteine. Vitamin supplement users have assumed they
<br>
are being protected against homocysteine overload, but this article will
<br>
expose that fallacy and recommend a scientific course of action to follow.
<br>
<p>The medical establishment woke up to the dangers of homocysteine when the
<br>
New England Journal of Medicine (April 9, 1998) and the Journal of the
<br>
American Medical Association (JAMA, Dec 18, 1996) published articles
<br>
suggesting that vitamin supplements be used to lower homocysteine levels.
<br>
This same message was published by the Life Extension Foundation 18 years
<br>
earlier (Anti-Aging News, Nov. 1981, 85-86).
<br>
<p>Some cardiologists suggest that coronary artery disease patients take a
<br>
multivitamin supplement to lower their homocysteine levels. Patients who
<br>
follow this advice, but fail to have their blood tested for homocysteine,
<br>
could be making a fatal mistake.
<br>
<p>The Life Extension Foundation has uncovered a flaw in the theory that a
<br>
person can blindly take vitamin supplements to adequately reduce
<br>
homocysteine levels. While folic acid, vitamin B12, B6, and
<br>
trimethylglycine (TMG) all lower homocysteine levels, it is impossible for
<br>
any individual to know if he or she is taking the proper amount of
<br>
nutrients without a homocysteine blood test.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>TMG Caplets
<br>
<p>TMG may be one of the most important nutrients to prevent heart disease,
<br>
stroke, liver disease and to slow aging.
<br>
<p>TMG stands for trimethylglycine which means it has three methyl groups
<br>
attached to each molecule of glycine. In the body, TMG donates one of its
<br>
methyl groups to cellular DNA, which may help protect DNA against
<br>
premature aging.
<br>
<p>When a TMG methyl group is donated to a molecule of toxic homocysteine, it
<br>
converts the homocysteine to methionine and s-adenosyl-methionine. A safe
<br>
level of homocysteine has not been established and this means that taking
<br>
nutrients like TMG could lower everyone's risk of heart attack and stroke,
<br>
in addition to protecting DNA. TMG should be taken with cofactors
<br>
vitamin-B12 and folic acid. If you take Life Extension Mix and Life
<br>
Extension Booster, you will get these cofactors.

<p>Folic Acid Plus Vitamin B12 Capsules
<br>
<p>Folic acid produces many health benefits. The Journal of the American
<br>
Medical Association says that folic acid can prevent atherosclerosis
<br>
caused by hyperhomocysteinemia.
<br>
<p>Folic acid is a member of the B complex and is often deficient in the
<br>
diet. Folic acid helps protect the chromosomes, is needed for the
<br>
utilization of sugar and amino acids, promotes healthier skin and helps
<br>
protect against intestinal parasites and food poisoning. The United States
<br>
RDA of 400 mcgs is less than what is needed for optimal health. Studies
<br>
show that folic acid in high doses can protect from cardiovascular
<br>
disease. The nutritional claim that folic acid can prevent spida bifida
<br>
from developing in the fetus if taken by pregnant women has been approved
<br>
for use by dietary supplement companies by the FDA.
<br>
<p>Folic acid should be taken with vitamin B12 to prevent the folic acid from
<br>
masking a B12 deficiency. The Life Extension Buyers Club offers only folic
<br>
acid capsules that contain vitamin B12. Many elderly people suffering from
<br>
neurological impairment find that B12 supplementation greatly improves
<br>
their cognitive function. Published studies show that vitamin B12 in
<br>
supplement form absorbs better in elderly people than vitamin B12 that is
<br>
bound to food.

<p>BOOK
<br>
The Homocysteine Revolution by Kilmer McCully, MD
<br>
<p>McCully, a pathologist at the VA Hospital in Providence, had been studying
<br>
the effects of homocysteine on arteries since the late 1960s, when he
<br>
unearthed old autopsy slides from an 8 year-old boy who died of a stroke.
<br>
Intrigued by a newly discovered disease called &quot;homocystinuria&quot;, McCully
<br>
realized that the same mechanism that caused heart attacks and strokes in
<br>
its young victims was probably responsible for heart attacks in
<br>
middle-aged adults.

<p>BLOOD TESTING
<br>
<p>Members of The Life Extension Foundation, through their blood tests, can
<br>
detect abnormalities that can be corrected before a disease state
<br>
develops. These tests will also help to optimize a personal life extension
<br>
program. No prescription is required for members and you will be mailed
<br>
your test results along with normal ranges and a brochure to further
<br>
explain the meaning of the tests.
<br>
<p>LEF Member tests other than those covered by insurance will be ordered by
<br>
the Life Extension Foundation Staff Physician, ie - a prescription will be
<br>
provided for you.
<br>
<p>You will be sent, by Priority Mail, a requisition form and information
<br>
about the nearest locations where you can have your blood drawn. You are
<br>
not limited to the drawing stations on the list we send. The final test
<br>
results will be sent to you by mail.
<br>
<p>You can obtain medical blood tests to measure your levels of DHEA, the
<br>
anti-stress, youth, immunity, longevity hormone; PSA for prostate, IGF-1
<br>
(growth hormone), fibrinogen, sex hormones, cancer tumor markers,
<br>
homocysteine, and the complete blood count and chemistry profile for
<br>
cholesterol, glucose, and other functions critical to your health - ALL AT
<br>
DISCOUNT PRICES!
