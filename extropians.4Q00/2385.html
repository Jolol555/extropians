<em>&gt; Okay, I'm sorry, but Gematria is not Extropic, it is drooling,
</em><br>
empty-headed
<br>
<em>&gt; rationalization.  Gematria is on the same level of sheer blank-minded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupidity as astrology.  If you start trying to be tolerant of it, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicates that you have become too open-minded and your brains are now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starting to fall out.
</em><br>
<p>If I met someone who based important life decisions on it, I would give them
<br>
the swift kick in an unnamed place that they deserve.  But I do find that it
<br>
can be a fun and interesting diversion during those times in which I just
<br>
want to throw reason to the dogs (gods?) and dine with the wizards.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a place for mysticism in embryo Extropians.  I myself dabbled in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mysticism up until the age of fourteen or fifteen or so.  However, I
</em><br>
expect
<br>
<em>&gt; mysticism in Those For Whom There Is Still Hope to take the form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fascination with psychic powers, the teleology of the Universe, exotic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical theories, mystical interpretations of qualia, reconciliation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultratech futures in terms of religious prophecies, and so on.  Taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astrology or Gematria seriously indicates that you are a flat-out idiot.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Respecting people who take astrology seriously does not impress others
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; your tolerance.  It simply indicates that you do not understand what
</em><br>
tolerance
<br>
<em>&gt; is *for*, and that you are trying to impress others by adherence to the
</em><br>
letter
<br>
<em>&gt; of an ethic whose spirit you do not understand.
</em><br>
<p>I'd disagree with that- to what end does the individual in question take
<br>
astrology seriously?  For what purpose?  What practice?  What do they do
<br>
with it?  I would never trust a doctor who made treatment assumptions based
<br>
upon my sun sign, but an artist who uses it for inspiration is another
<br>
matter entirely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, please note that the Committee on Un-Extropian Activities
</em><br>
will be
<br>
<em>&gt; investigating all participants in this thread for possible connections to
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; Green Party.
</em><br>
<p>As a Liberal Democrat who is going to see Ralph Nader speak this evening, I
<br>
fall awfully close to the line ;)
<br>
<p>(I tried, for six months, to embrace Libertarianism.  I just couldn't do it-
<br>
I'm far too compassionate (and I have too little faith in human nature) for
<br>
it)
<br>
