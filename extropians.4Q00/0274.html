</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>So, I wander off into another environment, big deal. I think Eliezer's point
<br>
was that there is such abundance for all, that no-one can harm anyone else
<br>
in any real fashion.
<br>
<p>I do dissagree with that, in the end. For instance, in the above scenario,
<br>
maybe I'm attached to the identity I've created in environment X, maybe I've
<br>
built reputation, maybe going elsewhere is not what I want. But then, maybe
<br>
I can be unfraggable (or whatever), depending on the rules of the
<br>
environment.
<br>
<p>The &quot;rules of the environment&quot; is an interesting idea. You could build an
<br>
environment (most likely many and varied) to enforce certain rules, like
<br>
unkillability, or karma, or killer hamster attacks, or whatever. Whatever
<br>
you like. If people want in, in they come.
<br>
<p>However, each member of the environment either has &quot;admin&quot; privellages, or
<br>
not. If not, then the environment surely a prison. If the person has admin,
<br>
on the other hand, then the &quot;rules&quot; are toothless tigers, shadows, only
<br>
applicable whilst the person wishes them to be.
<br>
<p>This leads to the conclusion that these environments must either have some
<br>
top level rules larger than and beyond the reach of the contained entities
<br>
(thus prisons), or that the environments could hold no real interest or sway
<br>
over members for more than trivial time, unless those contained entities are
<br>
vapid escapists who choose that the rules bind them indefinitely, rather
<br>
than deal with the rest of the universe.
<br>
<p>The only environment which doesn't hold to this analysis is the &quot;real
<br>
world&quot;, the physical universe, and only given that it's laws are not
<br>
dictated by a sentient (otherwise it classes as a prison, as above).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the crims and a special hypothetical environment that is just a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Doom&quot;, well, the problem is there is zero opportunity to learn to live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a less violent environment. There are no repercussions and no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incentives (beyond hopefully eventual boredom).  There may well be such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environments but I doubt they would be useful for anything but certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; types of &quot;entertainment&quot;.  This may mark me as really odd but personally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have any use for environments where people frag other people for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fun.  I realize that some people do.  To me that makes them odd.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heh, it takes all kinds.
</em><br>
<p>Why should anyone learn if they don't want to? The only reason to force
<br>
learning on others is to help ensure they respect a shared environment
<br>
better. The context in which the &quot;doom&quot; environment was proposed
<br>
(non-seriously) was one in which you don't have to share if you don't feel
<br>
like it (unlikely, to be sure). In such an environment, prisons make no
<br>
sense, except if your goal is power over others.
