Friends,
<br>
<p>I can't really work up any enthusiasm for death row cryo-suspension as an
<br>
application of cryonics.  The death penalty is highly controversial and in
<br>
a multitude of ways involves the worst of human behavior.  Acrimony between
<br>
political factions, interpersonal violence of the worst sort, before,
<br>
during, and after the initial event(s).  Revenge, justification,
<br>
rationalization, violent emotionalism being denied or disingenuously being
<br>
put forward as reason. Political expediency of the worst sort.
<br>
<p>I wouldn't want to see cryonics, which I view as a procedure suffused with
<br>
hope, optimism, and life-affirming intent, associated in any way by the
<br>
violence and human darkness which so completely colors the death penalty.
<br>
<p>In attempting to inform a wider constituency of the rational basis of
<br>
cryonics, we are already challenged to overcome flawed definitions of
<br>
&quot;death&quot;, deeply ingrained old beliefs about the inevitability,
<br>
irreversibilty, and naturalistic correctness, of death,  and the
<br>
&quot;scientific impossibility&quot; of cryonics.  Do we really need to add to these,
<br>
an application of cryonics which essentially puts it in the list with
<br>
hanging, the electric chair, the gas chamber, and lethal injection?  To do
<br>
so defines cryonics in the public perception as a form of execution.  If
<br>
that isn't bad enough, the political motivations behind this misuse of
<br>
cryonics, has it masquerading, in the most disingenuous and cynically
<br>
vicious way, as a humane act.  It allows the executioners, at the political
<br>
level, to have it both ways: &quot;We didn't *kill* the vile, subhuman, criminal
<br>
scum, we just *cryonically suspended* him/her. (Wink, wink, smile, wave to
<br>
the camera.)&quot;  Making it easier for political weasels to kill people feels
<br>
like a very dangerous place to go.  History suggests that as it is right
<br>
now, it's already way too easy.
<br>
<p>Call me a purist, but I think cryonics is about hope, progress,
<br>
rationalism, cultural honesty, compassion, and the ancient human quest to
<br>
end the depredations of disease, aging, and death.  If we want to promote
<br>
it, let's reach out from that philosophical center.      
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
