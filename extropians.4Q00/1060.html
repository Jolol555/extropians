<p><em>&gt; For discussions you need to be able to see the set of ideas and the

<em>&gt; variations that have arisen and how they evolved over time and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cross-cut any particular rigid organization of the information like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slash response-trees to work toward clarification and resolution.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rigid hiearchical structure on the offerings to the &quot;discussion&quot; simply
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, if I actually understood your point correctly. The ideal would
<br>
be messages connected to each other in any way the reader chooses, and
<br>
presented in whatever format the reader chooses. Some of the best minds
<br>
in the industry are working on stuff that can do this. In the meantime,
<br>
there's Slash and there's email, neither of which are 100% perfect, but
<br>
at least we have the code to Slash and the knowhow to change it to
<br>
accomodate the needs/desires of the participants.
<br>
<p>The following features are available for the discussion attached to an
<br>
article....
<br>
<p>Sort by: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oldest First 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newest First 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Scores First 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oldest First (Ignore Threads)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newest First (Ignore Threads)
<br>
<p>If you can recommend an additional sorting scheme, certain individuals can
<br>
start wrapping their brains around how to implement that.
<br>
<p>Organize as:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flat		[one message after another]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threaded	[top level messages and clickable headers for threads]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nested		[all messages shown, threads indented]
<br>
<p>Ditto.
<br>
<p>Threshold:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allows you to set the lowest score that you will see. I.e., if I don't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want to see any posting that was voted by others a score of less than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;2&quot; I would select 2 as my threshold.
<br>
<p>Ditto.
<br>
<p><p>The following features are available for viewing the articles themselves--
<br>
<p>Default (in the order they were posted)
<br>
<p>By topic. Click on the Topics link in the left box of the front page
<br>
and then click on the topic you want. All articles ever posted on that
<br>
topic will be listed. You can also narrow the listing to a particular section
<br>
and/or a particular author.
<br>
You can also just go to <a href="http://www.extrodot.org/topics.shtml">http://www.extrodot.org/topics.shtml</a>
<br>
<p><p>Finally, if you create an account for yourself and the log in as that 
<br>
account, you can customize your settings in too many different ways to 
<br>
list here by going to...
<br>
<a href="http://www.transhuman.memetree.com/users.pl?op=edithome">http://www.transhuman.memetree.com/users.pl?op=edithome</a>
<br>
...or clicking User Prefs in the left-hand box on any Extrodot page.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I welcome specific suggestions, though. Even if it's just one thing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mailing list does that the Extropy Institute slash site
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (<a href="http://www.extrodot.org/">http://www.extrodot.org/</a>) doesn't currently do. You may be surprised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by what sorts of suggestions we *could* incorporate, and just haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thought of or haven't realized they could be useful to somebody.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Frankly I'm surprised to see resistance to innovation on *this* list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have little resistance to something actually better.  I have a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resistance to things that are new but keep me from being able to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things I already knew how to do (although often clumsily) before.  As an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian I am interested in innovations that increase my capabilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and understanding.  I am not interested in innovation simply for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovation's sake.  I have been around long enough to see all too many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;innovations&quot; that were actually less capable than what was done before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in crical areas while providing some welcome newness in others.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, yes, I understand that.
