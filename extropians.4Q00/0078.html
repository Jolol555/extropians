I'm not surprised. He rarely responds to technical points, rendering
<br>
the whole interaction a rather sad parody of discussion.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>

<br>
Welcome to the wonderful world of extropians@, where resident AI
<br>
researchers don't have to read papers, because, well, they don't have
<br>
to, because they're so damn smart.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; Some questions I have include:  
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 1. What difference would cooperative coevolution make with respect to the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; relationship between humans and highly evolved AI?  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The AI can't derive any benefits from a transaction with the human
<br>
player(s). Apart from eating you, of course, since it has good use for
<br>
all the atoms in your body.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; 2.  Are the capabilities of AI severely limited in the absence of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; algorithms for cooperative coevolution?
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand that one.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; 3.   Potter's and DeJong's  EA's call for destroying unsuccessful
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;species&quot; and maintaining &quot;genetic&quot; diversity by introducing new species
</em><br>
<em> &gt; whenever stagnation is detected in the system.  Stagnation is detected by
</em><br>
<p>Did they show that the resulting complex system is more efficient?
<br>
(Guess what? I haven't read it either. Must have missed that URI).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; monitoring the quality of interspeices collaborations via checking each
</em><br>
<em> &gt; collaboration for the improvement it provides in the functioning of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;ecosystem&quot; as a whole.  Is this methodology  troubling with respect to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; possible future interaction between humans and AI?  Why or why not?  What
</em><br>
<em> &gt; are some other methods of maintaining diversity?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In comparison to mechanosynthesis-based life we're extremely
<br>
time-space-energy inefficient. Our relative fitness is so low we don't
<br>
have the chance of a snowball in hell.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; 4.  Do the &quot;species&quot; in this research correspond more closely to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; biological genes or to biological species?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Huh? The genotype (a bunch of bits) encodes a phenotype (&quot;behaviour&quot;)
<br>
when expressed in the system context. The phenotype gets evaluated for
<br>
fitness, not the genotype.
