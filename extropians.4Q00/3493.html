Chris Russo boldly asked:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What makes you you?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Besides the physical characteristics that I think that we can all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agree upon are copied down to the smallest detail, the mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;characteristics define who we are.
</em><br>
<p>You're assuming Cartesian duality, I take it, in that you assume the brain
<br>
and mind to be two separate entities. This is only true if you regard the
<br>
mind to not be comprised of &quot;physical characteristics.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Basically, my &quot;mental characteristics&quot; are comprised of memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have and the neural algorithms that drive my thoughts, as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any capacity to support those algorithms.
</em><br>
<p>True, true, but are these not physical characteristics? Are you familiar
<br>
with the idea of &quot;synaptic plasticity&quot; in memory cells and the assignment
<br>
of weights in neural networks?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Copy the mental and physical &quot;me&quot; exactly, and there's no real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distinction between the two.  
</em><br>
<p>This is where you run into some serious trouble (more serious than
<br>
philosophical trouble). First of all, by nature of the definition of a
<br>
&quot;copy,&quot; there is a definite distinction between the two, in that there is
<br>
a usually quantifiable spatial sepation between the two entities which
<br>
prevents them from being one in the same thing. 
<br>
<p>Take for example a correlative analogy between the dynamics of an exact
<br>
replica of you and, for the sake of application to computer science, an
<br>
exact copy of your Windows 98 platform transferred to another computer.
<br>
Say your biological replica, which is NOT you (because it moves to the
<br>
Congo in an attempt to avoid the concept of dualism while you remain in
<br>
Western Civilization) and your Windows 98 copy both are infected with
<br>
viruses - your replica gets ebola while your Windows gets a virused copy
<br>
of this email. 
<br>
<p>Up until this point, assume both copies might have the same dynamics,
<br>
unaffected by environment (which is untrue from the first millisecond
<br>
after the copy is made). Therefore, arguably (with a really compelling
<br>
argument) there would be no &quot;real&quot; distinction between the two. After your
<br>
replica comes down with ebola, however, you can bet there will be
<br>
observable-measurable-quantifiable changes in you and your replica,
<br>
distinguishing the two on many levels. Same goes with the Windows 98
<br>
example. After a week or so, the difference will be great enough that one
<br>
will be functional and the other will not. 
<br>
<p>You also said something earlier to the effect of sentimentality hindering
<br>
the acceptance of the idea that me and my replica have different
<br>
consciousnesses, and that I would still be trapped in me while my replica
<br>
goes off to the Congo. I ask, if there is an equal chance of mortality for
<br>
me and my copy (since although our environmental factors may change our
<br>
genetic predispositions, these effects are unpredictable due to the
<br>
chaotic nature of genetic physiology in human DNA and the randomness of
<br>
environmental events) - then what is the point of making a replica in the
<br>
first place??? With all sincerity,
<br>
<p>Cyrus
