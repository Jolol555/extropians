<em>&gt; &gt;that is the difficulty.  My its nature &quot;learning&quot; in the human brain (or

<em>&gt; &gt;formed and stored.  But this bundles up all learning with everything

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;difficult.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this problem you describe of the excessive context dependence of

<em>&gt; things learned *is* exactly the inherent difficult of communication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All learning is naturally context dependent, and it takes substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive effort to strip out person-specific context in order to try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to communicate what you've learned to other people.  Your hypothesis is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that some other architecture will do better at abstracting from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person-specific context when learning, which would then directly make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication easier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough.  Although focusing on communication aspects can miss the
<br>
implications for learning and the nature of knowledge and knowing that
<br>
are also present. It brings up a question of whether there is any brain
<br>
architecture that we can conceive of that does not have these
<br>
limitations. Doesn't the very act of incorporating knowledge require
<br>
blending it with what one already knows and believes?  It seems that to
<br>
optimize the acquisition of knowledge and its communication to other
<br>
minds would require a large degree of common knowledge infrastructure to
<br>
which new knowledge could be readily attached/incorporated. But this
<br>
would limit novel re-examinations and uses of the knowledge.  
<br>
<p>Do we get a tension between becoming part of a Collective and less
<br>
efficient learning and communicating but with higher inventiveness and
<br>
creativity?
