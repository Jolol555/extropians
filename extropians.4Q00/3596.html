<em>&gt;Rather than answer such questions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;let me try to clarify my position with a thought experiment I sent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the list a few years ago.
</em><br>
<p>Your duplicate earth doesn't explain anything.  It merely restates 
<br>
your position.  You claim that the duplicates are somehow connected 
<br>
or mystically &quot;one&quot;.  But you don't explain why you claim this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The bottom line is we don't have thoughts and emotions, we are thoughts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emotions, and the idea that the particular hardware that is rendering them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;changes their meaning is as crazy as my computer making the meaning of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;post different from what it was on yours.
</em><br>
<p>According to this line of reasoning, I don't ever need to watch a 
<br>
movie.  It doesn't matter whether my particular hardware experiences 
<br>
the movie.  Someone somewhere probably saw the same movie and reacted 
<br>
the way I would.  According to you, those parallel instances of the 
<br>
same experience are mine just as much as if I had them in this body. 
<br>
That may be your definition of watching a movie, but I don't want the 
<br>
attribute of movie watching to exist after I die, I want to 
<br>
personally experience this attribute the same as I do now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Try the experiment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Switch the position of the two hydrogen atoms and you find that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;state of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system remains identical,  the two could be instantaneously changing position
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and there would be no way two tell and no reason to care.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you assume this?  One may be sharing a bond with an oxygen 
<br>
molecule, while one is not.  One may be vibrating at a different 
<br>
temperature than the other.  One may be traveling at a different 
<br>
velocity than the other.  One may have its electron excited to a 
<br>
higher level than the other.  One may have acquired a neutron and 
<br>
become part of a heavy-water molecule.  If these two hydrogen atoms 
<br>
suddenly switched places, there could be a difference.  Just because 
<br>
two parts of a system are identical does not mean that they is only 
<br>
one such part.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Time for another thought experiment, me and my exact copy and standing an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equal distance from the center of a perfectly symmetrical room. A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mad scientist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;presses the button on a magic machine that he claims will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instantaneously exchange
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my brain with that of my exact copy.
</em><br>
<p>So you can mock up a room so each person sees the same exact thing. 
<br>
We can do this with two people who are not similar.  It doesn't prove 
<br>
a thing.  You still aren't explaining why you think that just putting 
<br>
them in the same environment mystically links them so that they 
<br>
become &quot;one&quot; with each other.  Do you believe that all Sufi mystics 
<br>
become &quot;one&quot; when they all meditate on the same mantra and put their 
<br>
thought processes into exactly similar states?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I maintain that absolutely nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is happening, not objectively and not subjectively, and if there is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this madman and a charlatan the difference is too small to be measured.
</em><br>
<p>But you are using circular logic.  You require them to be programmed 
<br>
the same, put in a symmetrical room, and not marked so we can tell 
<br>
the difference.  Then you claim because we cannot tell the 
<br>
difference, that there is no difference.
<br>
<p>What if they were wearing numbered prison uniforms?  Would they be 
<br>
different people?  What if the numbers were the same?  Would the 
<br>
become the same person?  What if they tried on 100 shirts in a row? 
<br>
Would they merge and unmerge as the same person depending which shirt 
<br>
they were wearing?  What if the numbers were covered so they couldn't 
<br>
tell the difference?
<br>
<p>Again, you keep restating your case, but you don't say why you 
<br>
believe this.  I understand that you are transferring information 
<br>
from one body to the next.  With enough information transferred, the 
<br>
new body can emulate the old one.  A good actor can do this today. 
<br>
What transfers the consciousness between one to the other?  When I 
<br>
send you these notes, and you read my exact sentences, I don't feel 
<br>
that I am transferring bits of consciousness to you.  If I did, I 
<br>
could kill myself right now, because anything I might think has 
<br>
probably been thought or will be thought be somebody else.  If your 
<br>
goal is to preserve information, all humans could die and floppy 
<br>
disks could live on.  However, those floppies aren't alive, and if 
<br>
they were, they probably aren't me, and even if they were another me, 
<br>
this me still loses consciousness and dies of old age.
