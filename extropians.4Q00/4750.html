<p>Ross, do you actually have a cat or a dog?
<br>
<p>I have a cat, and playing with her is rather ... demanding. Like a
<br>
small child, she makes up rules as she goes along. Sometimes it's simple
<br>
chase-the-string stuff ... but she varies her hunting pattern considerably
<br>
and gets bored if I just drag it in front of her. And sometimes she tries
<br>
to play head-games with the people around her. For example, she's got a
<br>
dominance game where every time a human gets out of their chair she'll
<br>
leap into it and sprawl out, taking posession: as if to assert her own
<br>
ability to occupy human territory.
<br>
<p>I wouldn't claim that she's as complex as a human being, but I suspect a
<br>
robot behaviourally complex enough to keep her amused would need to be at
<br>
least as smart as a dog or cat. (Unless it was mouse-sized, furry, and
<br>
designed to scoot into dark corners and squeak.)
