Its not obvious where your impact would be greatest.

Indeed, you could probably help the cause even by, say, running a Russian prostitution racket - simply getting rich and donating and investing the money in the right ways should work.

<p>Wow!!, so it's the amount of money that ultimately matters and not how you come upon it!  But, if my talents run in the area of selling illegal drugs then should I do that?  After all, aren't we talking about consensual crimes here?  Now Nick, how did you REALLY raise the funds for your education???  If I ever visit London will I hear stories told in the pubs about &quot;MacDaddy Bolstrom, philosopher-king of pimps!?&quot; ;)
<br>
<p>you continue:
<br>
Here is my advice: Think comparative advantage. Ask yourself, what are you most talented in? Go for that. It will give you the best chance of being both happy and effective in your life

<p>I've never been good at controlling women(to do anything for me!), selling illegal items under the threat of imprisonment or even scientific research so I will have to get back into college and become a highschool teacher of social studies.  
<br>
<p>I have a friend who wanted to take the twenty thou his parents saved for his college education and instead buy an old duplex and fix it up to rent on one side and live in the other.  This guy had talents working with his hands and doing construction work.  His folks said no way and he protested by joining the military which I think was a good idea for him.  Perhaps in time the parents will change their mind.  I bet given ten to twenty years he would have been making more money by acquiring and repairing old rentals then the majority of college grads would ever make with conventional careers.
<br>
<p>best wishes,

<p>P.S. If I ever hear of a Yale prostitution ring... lol :)
