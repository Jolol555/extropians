<em>&gt; No, he said 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; magic.&quot; He did NOT say that it WAS magic. THINK.
</em><br>
<p>If something is indistinguishable, than what is the difference?  (Which
<br>
brings us back to Leibniz's Law)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Anyway, since when is our destiny of a mundane nature?  This notion has
</em><br>
only
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been commonly believed for a very short duration of humanity's
</em><br>
existence-
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'd also argue that this notion is purely transitionary, a kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; collective &quot;dark night of the soul&quot; (as a mystic would put it) before
</em><br>
ourinitiation into the Transhuman existence...
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nobody is going to give us a leg up, there is no Galactic Confederation,
</em><br>
Von
<br>
<em>&gt; Daniken was a moron, and Childhood's End was FICTION. Get over it.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with all that you mentioned, but no one has yet explained why we
<br>
have not already been overrun by other transsentient cultures or see no
<br>
evidence of their existence- I see only three possible explanations-
<br>
<p>1. We're the only planet in the universe that has developed sentient life.
<br>
(Highly unlikely)
<br>
2. All sentient cultures are doomed to destroy themselves- there is no
<br>
singularity, no offworld colonization, no transsentience- so your entire
<br>
extropian movement is moot, and we should best look elsewhere for our
<br>
answers.
<br>
3. By gaining cognition of the universe at a level beyond our comprehension,
<br>
they have gained an understanding that has allowed them to transcend the
<br>
objective universe and become, essentially, gods.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sagan was showboating buffoon who was doing memetic programming.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but he was a damn good one...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Supernatural, adj. 1. Existing outside of, or exhibiting properties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradictory to the laws of, the natural universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, transhumans are NOT supernatural. Inhabitants of a Universe Prime,
</em><br>
running
<br>
<em>&gt; our universe as a quantum simulation, would be supernatural deities, but
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; cannot interfere with the simulation.
</em><br>
<p>Hah!  You're forgetting something- our knowledge of the so-called &quot;laws&quot; of
<br>
the &quot;natural universe&quot; are, in fact, the most likely interpretations that
<br>
our senses and our limited brains are able to give us.  A transhuman would
<br>
be supernatural, in the fact that through the knowledge and manipulation of
<br>
forces beyond the comprehension of &quot;mere mortals&quot;, they could essentially
<br>
alter realities in ways that could only be seen as going beyond the &quot;laws&quot;
<br>
of the universe.  Which, again, brings us back to Arthur C. Clarke's
<br>
statement...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; incredible: lacking credibility. Sorry, any Power I ever meet would likely
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; very credible in its existence. Overwhelmingly so. It might be amazing,
</em><br>
but it
<br>
<em>&gt; would not be mystical or supernatural.
</em><br>
<p>This cannot be known until it has been experienced.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I'm one of those strange people who sees no contradiction between being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mystical and being scientific (and I don't even need some arcane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interpretation of quantum physics or feel the need to bend the rules of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probability to back me up).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then you need to drop the SF and start reading real science books.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I certainly read &quot;real science books&quot;- but what does this have to do
<br>
with anything?
