Hello Samantha.
<br>
<p>----- Original Message -----
<br>
From: &quot;Samantha Atkins&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20Privacy%20now%20and%20in%20the%20future&In-Reply-To=&lt;005a01c05efc$940ca4c0$d2147318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I did not make a simplistic association.  I do not speak a vague
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generality.
</em><br>
<p>Sure you did.
<br>
<p>You said:
<br>
<p>&quot;If you are interested in it being more powerful then you are interested in
<br>
it being more open/free.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is the most basic, general, simplistic and direct of associations.  You
<br>
have not indicated the presence of other factors.  You say: want more power?
<br>
make more free.  I call that a simplistic association.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;  I am speaking of information and only of information, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of money.  Please keep on topic.
</em><br>
<p>That IS the topic and you should be aware by now that I do not share your
<br>
(rather small) definition of what information is.  As I've repeatedly
<br>
indicated, most everything will be information-- if you disagree, for
<br>
instance, that good nanotech will turn material goods into software then you
<br>
should make an argument.
<br>
<p>Why don't you think that money is information?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Irrelevant because there is one and only one of those actual physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; items.  I am not speaking of actual physical items but of information,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of bits.  That is the difference as I pointed out in my previous post.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dragging an actual physical item in to make your point is a mistake.
</em><br>
<p>Only if you are able to indicate why we shouldn't apply the same rules to
<br>
information in this context.  My introduction of physical items is very
<br>
deliberate-- if we desire to arbitrarily protect the asset of
<br>
'collectibility' of a physical item, what are the reasons we shouldn't
<br>
desire to do the same for information?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This does not work.  A duplicate is a duplicate and in the world of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collectibles can never be worth what the original is.
</em><br>
<p>It is relevant that the collectible is a duplicate only if I am able to
<br>
detect that that is so.  The object in question is worth what a buyer will
<br>
pay for it-- for collectibles, buyers pay for perceived authenticity.
<br>
Forgery is the process by which we attempt to replicate 'authenticity' and
<br>
it is currently illegal to practice this art because we wish to protect this
<br>
attribute (particularly with regard to money.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; We are speaking at cross purposes.  I suggest we both take a breather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and reset.
</em><br>
<p>I'd be pleased to take a breather, if only to forestall a massive debate on
<br>
a topic that has historically consumed a massive amount of my free time.
