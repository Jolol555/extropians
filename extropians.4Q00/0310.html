<p><em>&gt;Capitalism as a system has always required coercion, i.e.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;governments, simply to exist, if only to enforce contracts. And as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attractive as the libertarian fantasy of reducing governance to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simply the enforcement of contracts might seem, real-existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capitalism, dominated by various kinds of capitalists in alliance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with various kinds of military thugs, fascist thugs, liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;democratic polities, and all the other forces of modern politics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;real capitalists have always used the coercive aparatus of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;State in far more extensive ways than libertarians would like.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Which is why very few capitalists have ever been consistent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;libertarians.
</em><br>
<p>Your mixing economics and politics here. I am a capitalist
<br>
(economically) and a social libertarian (politically). Capitalists
<br>
can also be oligarchs, which appears to be what you are talking
<br>
about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Capitalists are by definition interested in making profit, not in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maximizing the greatest good through libertarian or democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;social policy. Different groups of capitalists respond to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economic and political terrains they face in different ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sometimes things are so dire they think their best bets are with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;backing military dictators, religious zealots, and racist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demoagogues in order to squash trade unions and leftist parties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sometimes they think backing democratic or even populist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;politicians is the best way to stabilize their economies, achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;social peace, fund education, health and other social investments
</em><br>
<em>&gt;important for a healthy workforce, etc. But in the end, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;bottom line&quot; for people who control finance and industrial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capital, i.e. the owning classes, is what will make profit, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maintain and reproduce their wealth.
</em><br>
<p>Capitalists are by definition those who practice capitalism, i.e
<br>
the private or corporate ownership of the means of production and
<br>
distribution.
<br>
<p>The politics some use to try to achieve wealth are something
<br>
completely different. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Libertarian policy, such as a laissez-faire attitude towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt;monopolies or dropping prescriptive control of drugs, in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cases has been been as violently opposed as social democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;policy by real-existing capitalists in real-existing capitalism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;precisely because it threatens the profit-making of existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capitalists. To define slavery and slave camp labor as not really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capitalist since it involves coercion, therefore, is absurd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Coercive labor, which includes killing labor organizers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;union-busting, and so on, is not libertarian or democratic, but is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;definitely capitalist.
</em><br>
<p>No it most certainly is not. Coercive labor is just that, coercive
<br>
labor, it has nothing to do with capitalism.
<br>
<p><p>The fact that some may try to defend what they are doing by calling
<br>
it capitalism is simply inaccurate.
<br>
<p>I am a capitalist, I am also a Union electrician, incompatible with
<br>
your statement above.
