Hal Finney has written,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But is this really the right direction for AI research?  Recall what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the goal is: approximating human level intelligence.  AI is a cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort which seeks to create a mental architecture.  Giving a robot a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; face and hands does not directly advance towards that goal.
</em><br>
<p>Then again depriving a human infant of a face and hands could stunt its IQ.
<br>
For a sample of Rod Brooks views on this try:
<br>
<a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/brooks.html">http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/brooks.html</a>
<br>
<p>AI (like bio intelligence) works by combining top-down (Minsky-theorized)
<br>
protocols with bottom-up techniques such as Murray Gell-Mann's &quot;Plectics&quot; and
<br>
Stuart Kauffman's &quot;order for free&quot; and Christopher Langton's &quot;dynamical
<br>
patterns&quot; along with the complex adaptive systems ideas coming out of the Sante
<br>
Fe Institute and Los Alamos.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Researchers try to justify this work by saying that forcing the robot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (really, the researchers) to solve real world problems will require the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development of intelligent algorithms.  Some go so far as to say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reason AI has failed to make progress is because the evolution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence requires interaction with the real world in a real body.
</em><br>
<p>I'd go so far as to agree with them, especially after perusing some of the
<br>
literature.
<br>
(Have you read Brooks work on this?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't buy this because it seems that AI is so primitive that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plenty of work that can be done in simulated environments.  It's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like AI creatures are so smart that there is no more challenge there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they're ready to move up to the real world.  The slow progress in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI is because it's hard, not because of a lack of challenge.
</em><br>
<p>A new (well, really not so new) approach is to provide AIs with the challenge.
<br>
It does no good if researchers solve all the problems for AIs, because then the
<br>
AIs are just parrots (like some over-educated people). The real challenge is
<br>
designing AIs that can pick up the challenge of learning and thinking on their
<br>
own, for themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem with the current direction is that a great deal of time is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spent on mechanical tasks of layout, construction, lubrication and repair.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is wasted effort in terms of trying out new cognitive structures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that this can only slow down AI progress in the long term.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree. I find the new direction and emphasis of robotics the most promising
<br>
development since AI was first considered a feasible enterprise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We are sacrificing true AI progress in favor of emotionally impressive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demos.
</em><br>
<p>See if you can figure out how the sand mouse works.

<br>
Then we'll talk.

<br>
<p><p><p>&quot;Blind faith, no matter how passionately expressed, will not suffice. Science,
<br>
for its part, will test relentlessly every assumption about the human condition
<br>
and in time uncover the bedrock of moral and religious sentiments.&quot;
