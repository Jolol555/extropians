&quot;Liw, Liw, Liw, Liw, Liw Liw, Liw
<br>
You look - a real keen
<br>
Even though you are green
<br>
With those big large heads
<br>
Something off of the movie screen

Little Green Men
<br>
lyrics [rap?] by Steve Vai
<br>
<p>&quot;Before them stood a little man about the same size as the
<br>
Munchkins.  He was clothed all in green, from his head to his
<br>
feet, and even his skin was of a greenish tint.  At his side was a
<br>
large green box.&quot;

The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
<br>
by L. Frank Baum
<br>
<p>How do we know that the aliens, or martians, 
<br>
are little green men? 
<br>
<p>Some clorophyll (or mint green) on their skin?
<br>
<p>The tradition of green Martian skin seems to have been started 
<br>
by Edgar Rice Burroughs in his Barsoom series, which began 
<br>
with A Princess of Mars in 1912 and continued over the next 30 years. 
<br>
In these books, the protagonist fights numerous Martians of various 
<br>
skin colours, one of which was indeed green. 
<br>
Prior to Burroughs, and even long afterwards, there was no tradition 
<br>
within written science fiction that Martians were of any specific colour. 
<br>
H. G. Wells, in his seminal The War of the Worlds (1898), describes 
<br>
the Martian skin as &quot;oily-brown&quot; and Edwin Lester Arnold, 
<br>
in his classic Lieutenant Gulliver Jones: His vacation (1905), 
<br>
assumes Martians to be completely human-like. 
<br>
The popularisation of the greenness of all sorts of aliens, 
<br>
not just Martians, can probably be put down to the imaginations 
<br>
of the creators of early science fiction film posters. 
<br>
Given black and white film to work from, they could come up 
<br>
with whatever colours they liked. Often they picked green as
<br>
&nbsp;the most alien--and, presumably, by its association with death 
<br>
and decay, the most horrifying-- of skin colours. 
<br>
This was reinforced in Britain at least by the Dan Dare strip in 
<br>
the Eagle comic, which ran from 1950 to 1969. 
<br>
The hero's most frequent opponent was the green-skinned Mekon. 
<br>
The Mekon was, of course, from Venus.

<br>
<p>The answer lies in what Martians represent and the emotional 
<br>
reactions they evoke. 
<br>
Since Martians are portrayed as radically different forms of life, 
<br>
it is important to make them visually distinctive and quite different 
<br>
from anything familiar. The easiest way to do this, while still crafting 
<br>
them as humanoid in shape and intelligence, is to change the colour 
<br>
of their skin. 
<br>
Green is also a colour associated with phosphorescence, 
<br>
a magical quality suitable for creatures that we hold in wonder, 
<br>
awe and fear. It is also associated with things that have decayed, 
<br>
evoking disgust and wariness. 
<br>
These emotional associations are quite important. The glow-in-the-dark 
<br>
association evokes curiosity and strong fear. How many films show 
<br>
scientists in protective suits approaching a captured Martian who 
<br>
emits light in a radioactive manner?
