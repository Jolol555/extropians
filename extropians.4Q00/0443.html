<em>&gt; Well, I asked Bruce Gagnon about this  (you can listen at

</em><br>
<p>Yeah, well, guess what?  That *is* basically the case today.  Granted,
<br>
there's no weapons up there (yet), but there aren't many nations other
<br>
than the U.S. whose military has significant assets in space already.
<br>
(*Who* owns the GPS satellites?)  If it came down to a major war, U.S.
<br>
military access to space could not practically be denied, but the U.S.
<br>
just might be able to deny said access to its opponent (especially if
<br>
the opponent was U.S. non-military interests).  But the U.S. has no
<br>
reason to shoot down everyone elses' birds (yet), so they stay up...
<br>
<p>In addition, it is fully possible not to desire to accomplish goal X,
<br>
and yet for goal X to be the logical consequence of one's actions.  Such
<br>
would appear to be the situation here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I promise you this - there are very few libertarians on the Boards of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lockheed Martin or Boeing. Yes, they'll take tax breaks and fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regs, but they sure as hell want to keep the government involved in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the space business.
</em><br>
<p>Uh-huh.  And they also profit much more from keeping space access the
<br>
way it is, rather than opening up space to everyone (though they will
<br>
pay lip service, if it gets them more goverment contracts).  Tax breaks
<br>
et al. would serve to encourage those who *are* honestly trying, even
<br>
if LM and Boeing might also profit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Deregulation won't get us to space any quicker. All aerospace concerns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are driven by profit, and they don't see much to be made in colonizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moon or Mars.
</em><br>
<p>I do.  Or, at least, in being able to build stuff up there.  (For
<br>
instance, telescopes beyond the atmosphere but still in a gravity well,
<br>
so they operate kinda like the ground telescopes we have here; that'd
<br>
fetch justifiably high access fees for the operator.)  Once you've got
<br>
stuff up there, it's cheaper to maintain with an on-site maintenance
<br>
crew, *if* the cost of said crew can be accounted for (say, by
<br>
amortizing across a lot of constructions).  And I'm far from the only
<br>
one who sees this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you want to support nascent space industries, why not prime the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pump by giving them lucrative contracts to pursue scientific research?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm sure they would prefer that to simply deregulating who gets to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fire off rockets, which is not such an attractive idea for national
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security reasons in the first place.
</em><br>
<p>Umm, no, they'd prefer the simple deregulation.  A lot of the research
<br>
has been done and is available, if only they could use it - it is the
<br>
engineering, not the science, that is the main challenge now.  And
<br>
engineers work much better if they don't have to constantly ask, &quot;may
<br>
I?&quot;
<br>
<p>As for security, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that, given a
<br>
choice between allowing American companies to flourish while letting
<br>
foreign companies drool at what America acheives, versus forbidding
<br>
American companies from a field while leaving foreign companies to their
<br>
own devices, the latter almost always results in non-American interests
<br>
getting much closer to American tech levels (and thus presenting a
<br>
bigger security risk) than the former.  (One major exception is nuclear
<br>
weapons: once you have the ability to make nukes, you have the ability
<br>
to make nukes; any defense or superior attack concentrates on the
<br>
delivery mechanism, not on the weapon itself.  Which means this danger
<br>
could actually be reduced if America had superior space tech, even if
<br>
other countries do gain ICBMs as a result.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you are interested in a serious, and decidedly pro-profit, space plan, look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ThinkMars [<a href="http://www.thinkmars.net/thinkmars2.html">http://www.thinkmars.net/thinkmars2.html</a>]. I interviewed the aspiring CEO of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this venture which is trying to collect the capital to get to Mars
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [<a href="http://www.changesurfer.com/eventhorizon/shows/1999.html">http://www.changesurfer.com/eventhorizon/shows/1999.html</a>]. And he made one thing very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear: any venture to get to Mars cannot rely on the for-profit motivations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industrial investors alone. They are looking for at least half of the investments to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underwritten by federal dollars. And they are not planning on planting any anti-Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missile batteries or running reconnaissance on the Chinese.
</em><br>
<p>Ehhm...right.  Federal dollars, *and* the freedom to say &quot;this won't be
<br>
used for military stuff&quot;?  Pull the other one, it's got bells on.
<br>
<p>How about a plan which generates its own profit, until it becomes
<br>
profitable - or at least affordable - for industrial investors, or just
<br>
plain rich dreamers (&quot;angel investors&quot;), to send missions to Mars?
