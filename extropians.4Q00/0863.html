<p>Thanks. Now I know not to waste my money there. I enjoy fantasy - but don't 
<br>
enjoy being sickened by it. The white power types can raise funds elsewhere.

<p><em>&gt;Why not consolidate the laws to eliminate the interstate disparities which

</em><br>
<p>There needs be only one law - the background check, with swift justice for 
<br>
anyone who fails it. And I do mean justice - those who are erroneously 
<br>
rejected should not be hassled unduly.
<br>
Unfortunately, this won't stop but some nuts and flakes - the career 
<br>
criminals and gangbangers will just go to the black market.
<br>
<p>But how can a background check be performed unless every individual in the 
<br>
country has a unique ID that can prove that a person is who they say they 
<br>
are? We almost have a national driver's license now - and many are afraid 
<br>
of the added power that gives the govt. to track people. Perhaps a chip 
<br>
implanted at birth - like the &quot;digital angel&quot;? I can see the fundies lining 
<br>
up to get their kids &quot;the mark of the beast&quot;...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Wrong.  #1, I'm not interested in the gun shows being shut down, just for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all weapons purchased there to require background checks of the buyer; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this could be done by computer or toll-free telephone.  #2, there ARE such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things as gun shops, gun manufacturers, pawn shops (all of which should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have their salse subject to background checks of their buyers, also); gun 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shows are not the only place for sane law-abiding adulte to buy guns.  #3, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guns are more expensive, heavier and bulkier (harder to conceal) than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pills, powders or joints, they cannot be used without people noticing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(even with silencers, there's the whole death thing), and they do not grow 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on bushes, shrubs or trees, nor are they easy to make (and a zip gun is no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;match for even a cheap .22).
</em><br>
<p>Silencers don't really silence any more than a truck muffler makes a 
<br>
Peterbilt a stealth vehicle. They just cut out the sharp &quot;crack&quot; that can 
<br>
damage your hearing. Silencers would be required by a government really 
<br>
concerned with health and safety of its' citizens. But - what can you 
<br>
expect of a government that makes commercial grain alcohol undrinkable by 
<br>
adding deadly poison?
<br>
<p>More and more, gun stores are being legislated and zoned out of existence. 
<br>
The thrust of HCI and Sarah Brady is nothing less than complete 
<br>
disarmement. She has been quoted quite a few times as saying exactly that - 
<br>
so don't expect any thinking person to believe anything HCI publishes. The 
<br>
facts are inextricably mired in with the outright lies.
<br>
<p>Again - from HCI's site you posted:
<br>
<p>Assault weapons were used…
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To kill 5 children and wound 29 others in a 
<br>
Stockton, CA schoolyard in 1989. The AK-47 held 75 - that’s right, 75 - 
<br>
bullets.
<br>
<p>Wow. 75! I know where to get a 100 - round mag to fit an AK. Not cheap, but 
<br>
legal. And it makes the already large and obvious AK look like something 
<br>
Arnold would carry. Not stealthy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To kill 8 people and 6 others at a San Francisco 
<br>
law firm in 1993. Two TEC-9’s with 50-round magazines were used in the 
<br>
massacre.
<br>
<p>If you limit mag size, the baddies will just fill their pockets with more 
<br>
magazines.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To kill 2 CIA employees and wound three others 
<br>
outside Langley, VA headquarters in 1993
<br>
<p>This was a former CIA type, was it not? A falling out amongst thieves!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To kill 4 ATF special agents and wound 16 others 
<br>
with an arsenal of assault weapons at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, 
<br>
TX, when the officers were attempting                 to serve warrants on 
<br>
the cult in 1993
<br>
<p>The ATF fired first - the people inside defended themselves. It's still not 
<br>
proven just who shot who - some accounts have the ATF firing wildly through 
<br>
smoke, hitting their own people.
<br>
ATF are tax collectors. If we need an &quot;assault weapons&quot; ban, it should be 
<br>
for these goons. If a taxman needs armed backup, let them call in the cops 
<br>
or federal marshals.
<br>
It's funny how it becomes a &quot;cult&quot; because HCI needs to make their point, 
<br>
isn't it?
<br>
<p>They forgot the infamous shootout in California where a couple of thugs 
<br>
with AKs and SKSs shot the hell out of the cops - the cops needed to go 
<br>
into a gun store for arms! This was what prompted the Ca. bans. But if they 
<br>
mentioned that one, they would have had to acknowledge that the cops got 
<br>
civilian &quot;assault rifles&quot; at the store and were able to turn the tables 
<br>
with them. Not the point HCI wanted to make, I guess.
<br>
<p>If you add up all the &quot;mass shootings&quot; and compare them to the atrocities 
<br>
committed by police and govt. agents in the same time period, I bet you 
<br>
come out about even. Got to look into that...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The armed guard at Littleton was no help, but I would prefer that only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guards be armed.  Otherwise, since people do flip out occasionally, there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be a greater chance that the occasionally postalgoing teacher would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find him/herself with a gun and a lot of little targets.
</em><br>
<p>Incompetent guard, then. Probably like the on-duty cop at my high school in 
<br>
Chicago in the '60's - in the lunchroom with the cooks, mooching food. Of 
<br>
course, back then, the ROTC had rifle drill with real M1 Garands, and 
<br>
target shooting with air rifles. The biggest thing the cop had to do was 
<br>
break up an occasional fistfight.
<br>
<p>Last &quot;postal&quot; teacher I heard of shot HERSELF to gain publicity about the 
<br>
&quot;problem&quot; of guns in schools.
<br>
<p>| There is one I've heard of; I think it was the Pearl, Mississippi 
<br>
shooting, where an assistant principal had a gun.  Here in Pensacola, we 
<br>
had a teacher's car broken into in the school |parking lot and her gun 
<br>
stolen.  Walking around 180 days a year arould a thousand little hands with 
<br>
your piece on your hip is not a good idea for most teachers either.
<br>
<p>Yep, that's one. Another was a hall owner who stopped a student with a gun 
<br>
from shooting a group of kids at the hall. He had a shotgun behind the 
<br>
counter. Ohio, if I am not mistaken.
<br>
<p>Metal lockboxes are available for auto use - they bolt through the floor, 
<br>
and are virtually theftproof unless the thief has a torch or cutoff saw. 
<br>
Responsible gun owners don't leave weapons unsecured in a vehicle.
<br>
<p>Admittedly, carrying a gun is not for everyone. But what about the &quot;Officer 
<br>
Friendly&quot; who comes in armed and ready? Perhaps we should teach the kids 
<br>
from kindergarten on about gun safety. Namely - NRA's Eddie Eagle - &quot;Don't 
<br>
Touch! Leave the area! Tell an adult!&quot;. Give them a fighting chance. As 
<br>
long as there are guns, there's a risk. We teach them about STDs...
<br>
<p>Kids who grow up with guns in the overwhelming majority grow up to never 
<br>
point one at another human being. Harris and Klebold are among the few - 
<br>
outnumbered millions to one.
<br>
<p>There are some little kids that were effectively killed recently by the 
<br>
State of California's child safety law - when the naked guy with the 
<br>
pitchfork broke in, the oldest child could not unlock Daddy's gun to 
<br>
attempt to defend her siblings. I hold the lawmakers responsible for this 
<br>
kind of incident.
<br>
<p>Here in Illinois, the first kid killed by an improperly stored gun after 
<br>
the child protection law took effect was the child of a Cook County 
<br>
Sheriff's deputy. The sheriff now has ordered all his men to keep their 
<br>
service guns locked up whenever they are at home. So now the crooks in Cook 
<br>
County know that it's safer to break into a cop's home than a plain old 
<br>
citizen's - the cop, by law, can't have protection available.
<br>
<p>Stupid, well-meaning laws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The reference to 52 Queens is from the movie &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where the sight of a red queen was the trigger to activate brainwashed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assassins.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks. Need to get that from Blockbuster - never watched it, always wondered..
