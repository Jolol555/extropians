Robin writes, quoting Hal:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;But isn't it relevant that changing society's discount rates may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;harmful?  Or is that simply off topic for this paper?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Harmful in what sense?  Making people choose actions that are less adaptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means making them choose actions that lead to fewer descendants.  The paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is about what actions better satisfy the preferences of the people involved,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether that leads to more or fewer descendants.
</em><br>
<p>All an evolutionary argument tells us is that changes in the discount
<br>
rate would ultimate lead to less survival and, yes, fewer descendants.
<br>
This may be due to increases in the death rate or decreases in the birth
<br>
rate.  Do we want to ignore the fact that a policy prescription may lead
<br>
to increases in the death rate?  Even if it acted through decrease in
<br>
birth rate, that may be due to poorer health.
<br>
<p>I keep asking the same question, which is, why is it OK for the paper
<br>
to ignore these effects?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;What if someone wrote a paper proposing to change prices.  Let's lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the price of gasoline to 10 cents a gallon.  That would improve social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;welfare because there are more consumers than producers.  Is it reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to neglect the impact of that change on the supply of gasoline, and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;look only at how this satisfies our preferences?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As economists usually define social welfare, this would not improve social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welfare.  Even if a few consumers gain, many more consumers would lose, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would producers.  All these gains and losses are from the point of view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the preferences of the people involved.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, there would be losses, but only when you analyze the full impact
<br>
of the changes.  A superficial analysis which only looks at the direct
<br>
effect of the price change will show that the majority of people gain
<br>
while a minority loses, because most people prefer to pay less for goods.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that the discount rate paper is providing a similarly
<br>
superficial analysis.  They are not looking at the full effect of the
<br>
changes they propose.  They are only looking at how much these changes
<br>
would directly affect people's satisfaction.  They are not considering
<br>
the larger impact these changes would have.
<br>
<p>Isn't it reasonable that changes in the discount rate will have long term
<br>
effects on society which could greatly change its economic structure?
<br>
The authors propose subsidies to capital accumulation and increases in
<br>
investment and saving.  These will tend to increase economic growth.
<br>
At the same time they recommend conservation of natural resources.
<br>
This will increase costs which may tend to limit growth.
<br>
<p>What happens when you rev up the economic growth engine, while at the
<br>
same time choking back the flow of raw materials which would normally
<br>
fuel that growth?  You could see a squeeze on substitute materials,
<br>
localized price increases, and general economic disruption.
<br>
<p>Isn't it possible that the society which results from making all these
<br>
changes, even though they are intended to satisfy people's preferences,
<br>
is one in which people are less happy than they would have been without
<br>
them?  Just as lowering gas prices ends up making people less happy,
<br>
even if it is done in order to satisfy people's preferences?
<br>
<p>Am I off base in making this analogy?
<br>
