<em>&gt; Sorry, John, I am hoist on my own petard. What I actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meant to say was &quot;all measurements are expressed to a degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of precision&quot; rather than accuracy. So then, the measurements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not especially precise (though they are exactly the sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of precision one would expect in a predecimal society), but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imprecision is not error. Despite your attempts to derive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a mathematical meaning to the words, the simple fact is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is a matter of fact statement, from which we would expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little precision, (though hopefully no error.)
</em><br>
<p>Actually, since pre decimal societies expressed non-integers as fractions
<br>
instead, and since both the greeks and egyptians and Babylonians had all
<br>
calculated pi to a far greater degree of both accuracy and precision, and that
<br>
the israelis were derived from the third and influenced by the second, AND that
<br>
the isrealis had done quite a bit of construction work in egypt and whose masons
<br>
who built the temple of Solomon were supposed to be highly skilled in
<br>
mathematics, it follows that either the bible is NOT the word of God, or that
<br>
God is an idiot and is a far lesser god than those of the greeks, babylonians,
<br>
and egyptians.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I expect just a little bit more, after all, he can thumb his nose at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. For that matter he could just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;change the value of PI so the passage would be correct, but He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;didn't. And He did something even more unforgivable, I expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;better writing ability from God than the Japanese gentleman who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;wrote the &quot;English&quot; assembly instructions for my stereo cabinet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know what Heisenberg has to do with it, however, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; round object is not always pi. If the round object is slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elliptical, there are a range of &quot;diameters&quot;, some of which give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a ratio less than pi, some more.
</em><br>
<p>Which makes the object an ellipse, NOT a circle. Since the biblican passage in
<br>
question specified a fixed diameter of ten cubits, then it follows that we are
<br>
talking about a circle, and NOT an ellipse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You might say, well the omnipotent God could make a perfect circle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or an item with an exact length. Perhaps you'd be right. However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this object, as is evident from the passage, was not made by God,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but by a bronzeworker named Hiram.
</em><br>
<p>Who was allegedly responsible for designing the Temple of Solomon, and given
<br>
what is known about architectural knowledge of the region and time, we know that
<br>
someone like Hiram actually knew of a far more accurate calculation of pi. And,
<br>
if Hiram knew, then its rather obvious that 'God' should have known. The fact
<br>
that the bible is allegedly the word of god, and it is wrong means that either
<br>
god is wrong or else the bible is not the word of god. Its all rather simple to
<br>
understand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So once again, it is perfectly possible to make a circle diameter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ten cubits, circumference 30 cubits, as long as you recognize that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this means &quot;to the nearest cubit&quot;. Which hardly seems an unreasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption.
</em><br>
<p>Since the israelis regularly used fractions of cubits in measurements, this is a
<br>
bogus point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, as I said, I feel a little uncomfortable with this discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here. It is not at all relevant to the subject of this list. I feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly so as a new contributor. So, as the saying goes, that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all she wrote.
</em><br>
<p>The original topic was to demonstrate that the Bible is NOT the word of god,
<br>
which is a concept that apparently some people have a memetic disposition to
<br>
disputing...
