<em>&gt; &gt; Suppose we know that the true theory of everything is of the form T, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it has one free parameter, a physical constant k that, on theoretical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; grounds, can take on any integer value between 1 and 1,000,000. But there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is no a priori ground, let's assume, why k should have one of these values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather than another. So by a principle of indifference, we assign each of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these possibilities an equal probability. Now consider the specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hypotheses Tn:=&quot;T and k=n&quot; for n=1, ..., 1,000,000. Probability calculus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then implies that the probability of Tn &lt;= 1/1,000,000. In other words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; each of these specific hypotheses must be highly a priori improbable since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are mutually exclusive and their combined probability cannot exceed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But, again, why should we reason this way at all?  Why should we be of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;belief that since we are able to attach a numerical value to a property of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the universe, it is therefore a 'variable'?  On what sort of theoretical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grounds can you presume to assign a particular set of integer values to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical constants?
</em><br>
<p>In my example, the integers [1;1,000,000] represented the possible values 
<br>
for some physical constant k. I'm saying that in absence of any reason to 
<br>
assign one of these possible values of k a higher probability than another, 
<br>
you ought to assign an equal subjective probability to each of these 
<br>
possible values. We could have theoretical grounds for thinking that the 
<br>
value of the constant must be in the interval [1;1,000,000] -- e.g. because 
<br>
the overall by-far simplest and most elegant physical theory implies that 
<br>
it has one of those values.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Even if it was in some sense physically necessary that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; k=42925, so that the physical chance of k=42925 is 1, this is compatible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with our prior epistemic probability of k=42925 being very small.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not following you here.  Again: why should we reason that since other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;numbers exist, they are (even a priori cognitively) available to said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;constant?
</em><br>
<p>You must distinguish between objective chances and subjective (or 
<br>
epistemic) probabilities to understand this point. Let me illustrate: 
<br>
Suppose you toss a coin which you know is biassed, but you have no idea 
<br>
which way. You rational epistemic probability of Heads in this situation is 
<br>
50%. This is so despite the fact that you know that the objective chance is 
<br>
not 50% but something different - maybe 70% chance of Heads, if that's how 
<br>
the coin is biassed.
<br>
<p>Similarly, maybe the physical chance of a particular physical constant 
<br>
having the value is actually has is 100%; the laws of physics require it to 
<br>
have that value. We can still consider what your ratinonal epistemic 
<br>
probability of the constant having that value is, prior to learning that 
<br>
the physical chance is 100%. (If you know what the physical chance is, then 
<br>
you should typically set your epistemic probability equal to it - this is 
<br>
known as the Principal Principle.) And your prior epistemic probability may 
<br>
well be very different from the physical chance. So why is this prior 
<br>
epistemic probability relevant? Because it determines which theory you will 
<br>
end up believing, given that you update your beliefs using Bayesian 
<br>
conditionalization.
