Subject: Re: Sentience
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Don't be silly.  I commit no Athena fallacy: I have no account
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;WHATSOEVER about how mind comes about, say nothing of one like you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;describe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; Exactly, the Athena Fallacy IS that you have no account of how the
<br>
S&gt; mind came about. The only human-been philosophical resource is
<br>
S&gt; the method introspection ... which is an inadequate tool.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&lt;quibble&gt;To say that someone has committed the Athena fallacy is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say that they have some *incorrect* view as to how the mind comes about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am in *ignorance* as to how the mind comes about.  I don't *know*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I can't possibly be committing the Athena fallacy on account of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this.&lt;/quibble&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No, the point about the Athena Fallacy (my invention, so you can't say
<br>
it means something different) is that consciousness &amp; intellect did not
<br>
emerge fully formed .... but arose over millennia, with intermediate phases.
<br>
Philosophers IGNORE the evolution of consciousness and try to deal with
<br>
what find through introspection (or verbal examination). However, you cannot
<br>
fully explain the presenting phenomena without an understanding of the
<br>
formative processes. For example, your analogy about the Turing machine
<br>
has no precedents in evolution, or any basis in fact about the architecture
<br>
of the E-1 brain. You are not alone, most philosophers make this error.
<br>
<p>S&gt; I have pointed out that I don't care if you phrase your description of
<br>
S&gt; consciousness as &quot; a phantom median eye&quot; or as &quot;the experience as
<br>
S&gt; if a median eye was present&quot; ...... but the vernacular does not impact
<br>
S&gt; on the phenomena, your whole posting is an attempt to confuse the
<br>
S&gt; issue ... clarification requires elimination of &quot;epiphenomenalism&quot;
<br>
S&gt; gobbledegook and all the other philosophical pseudo-language.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But if the phantom eye is a feeling, a mental object, then you're no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better off than when you started.  We began by saying &quot;I wonder how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the physical world is related to these mental objects!&quot; if you reply:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;they're linked through the phantom eye!&quot; and it turns out that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phantom eye is, itself, a mental object, then you haven't answered the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question.
</em><br>
<p>I think that there is a recursive, or additional self-referential property
<br>
owned by the illusion of the median eye that is not shared by other
<br>
aspects/objects  of consciousness, which is that the neurosignature
<br>
associates it as being PART of the self, the physical body, rather than as
<br>
externally originating. Muller's principal &amp;c. links particular sensory
<br>
signals to the nerve or special sense organ that carries the signal.
<br>
<p>The feeling of the phantom median eye, unlike visual sensations that go
<br>
away when we close our eye, is pervasive and continuous (the archetype
<br>
physical &quot;mind/ pineal eye &quot; had no eyelids or muscles of direction). So
<br>
I have always said that the phantom &quot;eye&quot; is not a separate entity from the
<br>
&quot;phantom median vision&quot; ..... my theory started as being called Phantom
<br>
Eye hypothesis, but I changed it to MVT precisely to emphasise that
<br>
what is important is that &quot;consciousness&quot; or mind is median-vision shaped,
<br>
which tells more that median-eye shaped.
<br>
<p>S&gt; How is a hypnotic suggestion or verbal cue a &quot;chemical stimuli?&quot;
<br>
S&gt; The brain of one person will react in response to suggestions
<br>
S&gt; given by another person (or TV &amp;co). Change of state, both physical
<br>
S&gt; and conscious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My error.  I was interpreting &quot;chemical&quot; to include physical stimuli
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as well, without telling you.  Anyway, the point stands that the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cannot act independently from its external physical stimuli; that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is entirely determined by them.
</em><br>
<p>What about dreaming when the body is paralysed and there is no
<br>
external physical stimuli?
<br>
<p>S&gt; If we were, then we could not experience internal light with no
<br>
S&gt; outside reference or causal source.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You're relying on the philosophical parts of MVT to defend this claim;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these are the very points which I reject.
</em><br>
<p>OK, I've only sold you on part of the package so far, but think that
<br>
the conceptual stuff likely follows, even if I haven't yet developed a
<br>
conscious machine on the MVT model, or a telepathy device to check
<br>
for consciousness. There seems no reason in principle why a device
<br>
could not me made that could sit in a shielded room, away from a
<br>
subject looking at playing cards or visual stimuli, and arriving at correct
<br>
predictions of what card the person is thinking of ... quantum physics
<br>
allows this possibility, as does logic.  Then your points about subjectivity
<br>
might be rejected.
<br>
<p>S&gt; I am rather insulted that you compare me (and everybody else) with
<br>
S&gt; lumps of rock.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;People were offended when they were compared with apes.  But the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;analogy is apt.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, I identify with my primate brethren, and do not think I
<br>
have any brain parts that E-1 animals such as cats have. But what value
<br>
does your rock analogy have, we are nothing like rocks? You are really
<br>
stretching this doubtful &quot;all made of atoms&quot; thing to absurd lengths.
<br>
How is a rock intelligent, let alone conscious?
<br>
<p><p>S&gt; How do you deal with holes (distinct from GAPS, which depend on
<br>
S&gt; the fact that there was ONCE something present but no longer, whereas
<br>
S&gt; a hole might be integral)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes, I cut them out because I agreed with them.
</em><br>
<p>So you accept that there are non-physical objects, and further accept the
<br>
difference between &quot;hole&quot; and &quot;gap&quot; although both may be indistinguishable
<br>
at the time of examination? Do you accept that holes are completely
<br>
PSYCHOLOGICAL (contents of consciousness) and not at all physical?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;NO!&quot; you say.  &quot;It solves the Leibniz objection!&quot;  No, it doesn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;See, non-physical objects can't move physical objects around, and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;CAN'T MOVE HOLES AROUND EITHER.  They can't in any way affect the size
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or shape of holes; to do so, they'd have to move the *stuff* near the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;holes, which, you concede, is impossible.  Neither does it help us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say that the *holes* cause consciousness.  Because, while you can show
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the holes are necessary for conscious behaviour, you can't show me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how the *holes* can affect the non-physical world, either.  You just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say that they DO affect the non-physical world, but you *don't* say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how *holes* can do that.
</em><br>
<p>I raised the hole point to illustrate that non-physical entities can exist.
<br>
There is an analogy between holes and the abstract median eye.
<br>
But what is additional regards the median eye is that its FUNCTIONS
<br>
as well as its form have been lost. There is an abstraction activity in
<br>
place of the original median eye input activity .. nature abhors a
<br>
vacuum!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You can say: &quot;Listen, not-having a median eye causes consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reports, and other intelligent behavior.&quot;  And I say, great!  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fantastic news.  That's MVT'.  But then you go on to say: &quot;What's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more, not-having a median eye causes consciousness itself!&quot; and I say:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How can you possibly prove that?
</em><br>
<p>OK, but questioning how I can prove it is not questioning that it is true.
<br>
I can triangulate, and use evidence from several independent fields
<br>
(physiology, evolutionary, psychological, conceptual/ philosophical &amp;c.
<br>
that all point towards MVT as having solved consciousness, but as you
<br>
have realised, the empirical data alone only makes a probabilistic case
<br>
since measurability of subjective experience is (not yet, and maybe never)
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p>This does not make MVT any less true. We must evaluate competing theories
<br>
and go with our best judgement .... name ANYTHING that can be proven to
<br>
absolute certainty. Deductive logic and mathematical proofs rely on the
<br>
identity statement (1 + 1 or a = a) and so can be denied.
<br>
<p>S&gt; &gt;Brains are like Turing machines in that they are composed entirely of
<br>
S&gt; &gt;simple physical parts that do simple physical things.  These physical
<br>
S&gt; &gt;parts move deterministically in lock-step.  (Though, to qualify this
<br>
S&gt; &gt;view, I'm a fan of many-worlds.)
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; the dualist problem has been described
<br>
S&gt; precisely that the pineal gland (or any brain part) cannot be &quot;moved&quot; as,
<br>
S&gt; say, a hand can be moved.
<br>
S&gt; What parts of the brain &quot;move?&quot; ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Neurotransmitters flushing about in your synapses, along with ions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pumping through your membranes, allows electro-chemical signals to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sent throughout the brain and down your axons to your muscles, glands,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and other parts of your body.  These are the brain's &quot;moving parts.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Out of context ... the Descartes' discussion is about wilful moving of the
<br>
brain, like the hand can be moved. We cannot move any bits of our brain.
<br>
Sure, blood moves through it, and nerve impulses, like all of the rest of
<br>
our
<br>
body, but these are autonomic processes ... not consciously controlled.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Also, the point with parallel computing is that things happen in
<br>
S&gt; PARALLEL, not in serial lockstep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;True, but this can be emulated by a Turing machine: in a given quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of time, it updates the first part, then the second part, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;third part, ... and finally the Nth part.  Then it updates the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quantum of time, etc.  Thus a Turing machine is functionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equivalent to any parallel machine.
</em><br>
<p>Are you appealing to the reduction to statistical mechanics when you make
<br>
this claim? Even if you are, you are still wrong because the parallel brain
<br>
works in REAL TIME, not in simulation. Furthermore, the neural computers
<br>
exhibit graceful degradation and can re-route and self repair. The
<br>
grandmother
<br>
cell claims have been widely rejected, memory and information is distributed
<br>
and associated with weight-states, so what experts are you citing to back
<br>
your
<br>
claim that the mammalian brain resembles a serial computer?
<br>
<p><p>S&gt; &gt;Moreover, the physical world is causally closed.  Nothing non-physical
<br>
S&gt; &gt;interacts with the brain.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; See the verbal cue example above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ah, but verbal cues, while they aren't *chemical*, are entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*physical*.
</em><br>
<p>I think I have you on the run here. Say the verbal cues are written on a
<br>
page ... together with a load of meaningless scribble .... and further
<br>
say that you are dreaming of seeing the words. Maybe they are shocking,
<br>
something like &quot;The Writing is on the Wall&quot; and you wake up, shocked.
<br>
<p>Which part of the verbal cues are physical here?
<br>
<p>S&gt; Yes, nothing non-physical interacts with the PHYSICAL bits of the
<br>
S&gt; brain, but thoughts (dreams, and other non-physical stuff) can
<br>
S&gt; interact with the NON-physical gap in the brain. Consciousness is
<br>
S&gt; the infinite-state feedback loop between the brain and the
<br>
S&gt; environment made possible because the brain expects to receive data
<br>
S&gt; from a peripheral sensor that has gone missing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Right.  So: a red-wavelength beam of light hits my eye.  It hits
</em><br>
<em>&gt;red-receptors in my eye, which send electrochemical signals up to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brain.  How does this signal make me have the conscious sensation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;red?  All I can see it doing is causing more physical activity in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brain.  The fact that there's no medial eye there doesn't seem to help
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this explanation out.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, a key question .... we can see that the original red wavelength is
<br>
translated into action potential signals by the rods and cones so that
<br>
the information can be carried along the optic nerve. There is no actual red
<br>
light anymore, but the end perception is of a red light, not of an
<br>
electrochemical
<br>
buzz. The abstract/ illusory sensor (locus of awareness) is the part of the
<br>
brain
<br>
made of the same type of information, and allows the new signals to be
<br>
reintegrated as meaningful experience ... (1) It is generic, the pineal eye
<br>
predates special senses and of course the electrochemical medium is the
<br>
same (generic) whether the original information is auditory, visual or
<br>
olfactory.
<br>
(2) I don't like Dennett's Cartesian theatre case, but do think that the
<br>
conceptual
<br>
space vacated by the old physical sensor(gan) does give a structure for the
<br>
mass of generic neural information to be interpreted against. The TV screen
<br>
decodes signals (via the aerial/ nerve channel) into a moving picture and
<br>
sound
<br>
that can be observed by the viewer ... the phantom median eye provides a
<br>
virtual
<br>
screen (shape and place) to reintegrate experience.
<br>
(3) There is a neurocomputational account based on the deep pathways of the
<br>
limbic brain associated with median eye data processing in early information
<br>
that underlies more recent pathways, for instance in the visual cortex.
<br>
Gibson
<br>
gives a gestalt account of your red light example ... and would say it
<br>
actually is
<br>
seen IN the eyeball .. but the organism reacts as a whole entity (eg. if the
<br>
light
<br>
is a car about to hit you, your whole body instinctively takes evasive
<br>
action.
<br>
<p>I do think that E-2 animals (with pineal eye still working) actually see red
<br>
light,
<br>
but I claim specifically that they cannot IMAGINE red light without it
<br>
actually
<br>
being present in their retina. It is abstract and self-referential
<br>
consciousness
<br>
that MVT seeks to explain .... including dreams. Insects and E-2 animals
<br>
can't think about the red light or create the signals for it internally, and
<br>
so are
<br>
rather more deterministic animals than we (or monkeys) are ... though I
<br>
would
<br>
say even in the case of insects they display teleological, ends directed
<br>
behaviour,
<br>
and would not want to rule out awareness entirely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Similarly, suppose my consciousness has made a decision.  It wants to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;send a message down to my hand to type the word &quot;red&quot;.  How does this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;signal get to my brain?  Once again, the fact that there's no pineal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eye doesn't answer the question.  And, not coincidentally, no signal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from my consciousness is necessary: my brain seems to be doing all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work *already*: that signal from my eye triggered a purely physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complex system, which sent the message back down to my hand to write
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the word &quot;red.&quot;  How did the consciousness help this process?  Once
</em><br>
<em>&gt;again, the non-existence of the eye doesn't help.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, much background processing is going only unaware to you ... but
<br>
we have an ability to &quot;focus our mind&quot; or concentrate, and to make
<br>
decisions. Our ancestors' attention (during reptilian phase) was the
<br>
unavoidable spotlight of the pineal eye/ median spectral field, which
<br>
reacted hormonally in response to light, and the hormones governed
<br>
muscle action and behaviour directly. We now act indirectly, but the
<br>
attentional &quot;space&quot; or pervasive illusion of self, is where the pineal eye/
<br>
median spectral field would have been, the same centres in the brain are
<br>
activated (I think the reptilian, limbic structures and brain stem,
<br>
hippocampus
<br>
and amygdale and still fundamental in formulating our emotional, reactive
<br>
responses to information received).
<br>
<p>So I think we can focus in on particular information of importance ....
<br>
rather
<br>
like the reading head of your Turing machine perhaps (?) because of this
<br>
singularity (in Leibnitz' monad sense, the undivided &quot;structure&quot; in the
<br>
brain)
<br>
and make Descartes' &quot;sens communs&quot; out of the chaos, the diverse sense-
<br>
information ..... an illusion or simulation of the outside world represented
<br>
on
<br>
the walls of our internal cave (Plato) seen by a sense-organ that itself is
<br>
an illusion or hallucination of a structure that no longer juts out of our
<br>
skull.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Let me predict an answer: &quot;the holes are in just the right places and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in just the right shape such that they were intimately involved in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;both physical systems!  The non-existence of the pineal eye explains
</em><br>
<em>&gt;why you wrote the word 'red'; what's more, that 'red' signal passed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right through where the pineal eye would have been!'  You're sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right about that.  But all this is part of MVT', the part of MVT
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that makes only scientifically verifiable statements.
</em><br>
<p>Now you can compare your prediction against my somewhat fuller
<br>
answer, I hope it is a bit clearer to you, and that you might see where
<br>
your Turing notion comes from?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What you didn't explain is what the holes have to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*consciousness*.  Why does the fact that the pineal eye
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would-have-been there imply that your conscious mind had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*sensation*?  How did your conscious decision get the holes into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right places?
</em><br>
<p>Don't get too carried away with the holes analogy (which comes
<br>
originally from Descartes talking about memory being a process
<br>
rather like punching holes in a cloth .... or card-reader .... it is
<br>
the functions and neuronal pathways associated with trace pineal vision
<br>
that interests me more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Conscious behavior IS a trick of nature.  But what about consciousness?
</em><br>
<p>I am not sure that I agree with your behaviourist distinction. Consciousness
<br>
is a clumsy, blanket term, I agree. &quot;Mentation&quot; or &quot;mental events&quot; are
<br>
not &quot;behaviour&quot; in the same way that having a pee is behaviour. I happen
<br>
to think that we are in &quot;trance&quot; to some degree or other all of the time,
<br>
after all, even you seem to accept that we only experience red light
<br>
indirectly
<br>
via the medium of electrochemical signals, and thus can never know the
<br>
world &quot;directly.&quot;
<br>
<p>In this analysis, there isn't any &quot;behaviour&quot;, just awareness of behaviour.
<br>
So the question is not 'what about consciousness' which is a given, but
<br>
&quot;what about BEHAVIOUR?&quot;
<br>
<p><p>S&gt;&gt; I find it hard to agree with your Epiphenomenalist assumption that
<br>
S&gt; everything that has happened in the universe to date would have
<br>
S&gt; happened in exactly the same way if no animal had ever been even
<br>
S&gt; remotely aware of anything, and that we are robots following out a
<br>
S&gt; behavioural script. This is not my experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is like replying to the claim that the earth spins and revolves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around the sun with the claim &quot;this is not my experience.&quot;  From here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it looks the same either way!  It looks the same whether the sun goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around the earth or whether the earth goes around the sun.  Only when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we attempt to do some scientific inquiry does the correct view come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the foreground.
</em><br>
<p>My experience is shared by most people, and even most philosophers,
<br>
in that I can find not the slightest shred of evidence to support the wild
<br>
epiphenomenalist claim that everything would be EXACTLY the same
<br>
if no consciousness or feeling had ever happened. You accept this
<br>
logical extension of your position presumably ... it is standard philosophy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Similarly, from the inside, it looks the same whether you're making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decisions or whether you're acting on externally determined desires.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Indeed, I argue that you've been externally determined to believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your desires are internally determined.  But when we do some science
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we see that only physical elements are at work, and that non-physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elements play no role in the way we behave.
</em><br>
<p>You persist with this belief-desire hypothesis ... there is plenty of turgid
<br>
response to this in the literature. Suffice to say (actually replying to
<br>
your
<br>
earlier point that I can't dropMVT because of my desire to have that belief
<br>
... which I reject because my desire is to find the TRUE or most true
<br>
possible
<br>
answer ... MVT isn't a particularly desirable scenario in some ways, I would
<br>
prefer that there is a benign God who will see me safely through life to a
<br>
blissful eternal afterlife .... but unfortunately the evidence persuades me
<br>
of MVT and not areligious belief, (sob, weep).
<br>
<p>S&gt; So you seem to agree with McGinn ... a very defeatist stance, and very
<br>
S&gt; unextropian! You haven't managed to answer my point against this
<br>
S&gt; that, and I repeat since you avoid answering here:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's only &quot;defeatism&quot; if you're giving up on the possible.  Is Godel's

<em>&gt;Incompleteness Proof pessimistic about the possibility of designing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;formally complete arithmetic?  No.  It shows that it's impossible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Every optimist should accept &quot;defeatist&quot; arguments of that kind.
</em><br>
<p>You must ditch the possible if it contradicts the probable!!
<br>
<p>Free-will is a much more fruitful stance than determinism, and does allow
<br>
that many aspects (genetics &amp;c) are determined. Utility must decide here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; S&gt; Perhaps I should develop new and irresistible hypnotic applications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; from MVT and enforce belief in it ... would this satisfy you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; This example was deliberately crafted because it underlines the
<br>
S&gt; pre-eminence of consciousness ... and goes against epiphenomenalism.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; How do you answer this method of &quot;proving&quot; MVT?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;MVT' may well have some useful applications.  You would not prove MVT,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but only MVT'.  You still would not show how holes affect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness, and would not have shown that consciousness can affect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;holes.
</em><br>
<p>For the sake of argument, I am using a powerful new hypnosis developed
<br>
from MVT that enforces amnesia if necessary of your qualms about
<br>
consciousness (forget holes ... they are for illustrative purposes only to
<br>
defeat your physicalist/atomist claim, it is the functional abstraction that
<br>
explains
<br>
self-referential consciousness). So assume that my hypnotic suggestion
<br>
works,
<br>
just as a thought-experiment, and answer whether or not I have proven MVT to
<br>
your satisfaction ... after all, you now believe what I tell you, and I tell
<br>
you it is
<br>
proved!
<br>
<p>S&gt; I fully intend to pull the turf away from under your feet! &quot;Philosophy&quot;
<br>
S&gt; (love of argument) cannot be roped off and protected in the way
<br>
S&gt; you would like ... weasel words cannot stop the march of progress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Progress can march on.  Why, if we never talked about consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ever again, we'd lose nothing at all.  Intelligence is all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matters.  Consciousness is a joke.
</em><br>
<p>And sentience, awareness, mentation, mind ....? I agree with you to
<br>
a point, but if you think that there is only conscious behaviour, and
<br>
further
<br>
think that MVT solves it (animal intelligence or whatever you want to call
<br>
it) then why are you persisting this dispute?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why progress towards an understanding of a stupid word that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophers made up?  Why not grant that they made it up so as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;keep you from leaving them out of a job?
</em><br>
<p>But I want them out of a job. They just serve to confuse .....
<br>
<p>S&gt; So I don't accept your notion of MVT' ... because knowledge is seamless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No, claims can be analysed into parts.  MVT is a compound claim about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;observable facts and unobservable facts.  I accept MVT's observable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;claims and reject MVT's unobservable claims.
</em><br>
<p>OK, I know that there is a weak and strong version of MVT, but if you
<br>
accept all the empirical premises of MVT is is difficult to reject the
<br>
conclusions or come up with different ones. Proof positive may be
<br>
forthcoming, but will it be in your lifetime, and what are you going to
<br>
believe in the meantime?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You'd say: &quot;No, the Fairy theory is stupid.  I accept all the bits
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about observable stuff but reject the bit about fairies dancing on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particles.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;What would you think of me if I said: &quot;I don't accept that notion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;... because knowledge is seamless!&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;That's what I think of your rejection of MVT' on those grounds.
</em><br>
<p>I accept this except that I think the conclusions about unobservable
<br>
parts of MVT do fit the facts well and are not absurd like your fairy
<br>
example.
<br>
<p><p>S&gt; The mind-body problem ... only like can interact with like, therefore how
<br>
S&gt; does the (observable) brain manifest (non-observable) mentation .... can
<br>
S&gt; be dissolved by the MVT explanation in terms of a illusionary sense-organ
<br>
S&gt; which is nevertheless continuous (even supervenient, in Jaegwon Kim's
<br>
S&gt; mereological sense of this silly word, perhaps) with the brain matrix.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No.  You don't explain how consciousness can interact with holes.
</em><br>
<p>The above paragraph talks about how only an illusionary sense-organ can
<br>
sense illusionary sense-data ... and mentions Kim's &quot;whole-part fusion&quot;
<br>
or merological supervenience notion ..... we have left holes behind with
<br>
discussion of atomism ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The illusionary body part isn't there *at all*.
</em><br>
<p>It persists as a trace, archetypal (embryonic  even) memory or engram
<br>
and as a phantom or &quot;felt&quot; part of the body matrix.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have &quot;dealt with&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world of consciousness only if you argue that &quot;like affects like:&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I do argue that, following Leibnitz.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;that the world of consciousness can interact with non-existent objects
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because consciousness doesn't exist in the first place.
</em><br>
<p>We have an overloading of the word &quot;existence&quot; here. Let us stamp
<br>
out mere verbal triviality and stick to the phenomena where possible,
<br>
please.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;It uses a different algorithm from the one Kasparov uses.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Kasparov uses an algorithm too.  (His is certainly better, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hard to read off from the neurons, and ever trickier to program.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Ss&gt; The human player tends to use entirely different approaches, Casablanca
<br>
S&gt; for example said that he only ever looked one move ahead, &quot;but the best
<br>
S&gt; move!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes, but his nerves did the rest, unconsciously.  I rarely think very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hard about breathing, but it's rather complex.
</em><br>
<p>But admitting that your Deep Blue doesn't have nerves or unconscious
<br>
processes undermines your case that human and computer are the same!
<br>
<p>S&gt; Anyway, you haven't explained away the programmers needed for Deep Blue
<br>
...
<br>
S&gt; Kasparov can modify whatever heuristics he uses as a result of feedback
<br>
from
<br>
S&gt; outcomes, but bugs in Deep Blue needs programmers .... homunculi.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm saying that it's a coincidence that programmers were needed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;program Deep Blue while none were needed for Kasparov.  Deep Blue was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;designed by people.  Kasparov looks designed because he evolved.  Deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Blue could have evolved, if the evolutionary pressures went the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way, but they didn't, so we got us instead.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly &quot;they didn't&quot; ... so the two things are entirely different types,
<br>
and you
<br>
cannot use deep blue as even an analogy for animal intelligence, let alone
<br>
consciousness!
<br>
<p><p>S&gt; Will get round to dealing with your other points when I have more
<br>
S&gt; time.  But to date, nothing you have said convinces me much. Why do
<br>
S&gt; you bother to plow a trough which you think is sterile and
<br>
S&gt; pointless? Science can throw up new solutions and information, but
<br>
S&gt; it seems your type of tautologous speculation can never get
<br>
S&gt; anywhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No, it won't.  In fact, I think something quite radical about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness, that gets us quite far indeed, but we're talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something else at the moment.
</em><br>
<p>But you have said that consciousness is stupid, and doesn't exist
<br>
because there is only &quot;conscious behaviour&quot; .. so you cannot put
<br>
forward a &quot;theory of consciousness&quot; without contradiction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes, determinism vs. free will is a pointless debate.  Except for when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people start saying that computers can't be like us because one of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is determined and the other is not.  That's when we have to have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;argument.
</em><br>
<p>I think that computers can't be like us only because even if they had
<br>
self-referential consciousness it would be DIFFERENT from ours,
<br>
because the self they would be aware of would be a (silicon) entity
<br>
and not a human or posthuman entity. I also happen to think that
<br>
self or self-organisation, independent decision-making, is not
<br>
a feasible concept in a world that is wholly determined. Even you
<br>
backtracked and allowed that in NLP psychotherapy an individual
<br>
could modify their metaprogramming (degree doesn't really matter,
<br>
you have breached your deterministic principle in that previous mailing).
