<p>
As a recently engaged extropian, I feel I can offer some insight into this
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p>One will always find the best relationships with their intellectual peers.
<br>
Due to the lingering effects of our patriarchy, today's women are still
<br>
mostly airheads.  I have long since discovered that true love with such an
<br>
airhead is impossible.
<br>
<p>However, there are a good number of intellectually gifted women nowadays,
<br>
they're just hard to find.  And for them, it is likewise hard to find
<br>
intellectually compatible men, for most men are airheads, too, despite their
<br>
advantages.
<br>
<p>Then there's the geek factor.  Let's face it.  Most people that have the
<br>
brains to be extropian are lacking in looks, social skills, or both.  It
<br>
takes a lot of deprogramming for those who are both intelligent AND good
<br>
looking to realize that the intelligence is the most important factor and go
<br>
for the nerd instead of the babe or jock.
<br>
<p>There is also the fact that high intelligence (and the money that it often
<br>
brings) gives you the ability to seduce the more beautiful members of the
<br>
opposite sex that would be otherwise inaccessible to you.  Many social
<br>
extropians will choose this path and never discover the joys of dating an
<br>
intellectual equal.
<br>
<p>Then there's the typically extropian tendency to sit on the computer all day
<br>
writing code or posting to the usenet.  This rarely leads to marriage.
<br>
<p>Plus, there is the implication of monogamy that exists in traditional
<br>
marriage that anyone with half a brain realizes is a pile of dog-doo (or at
<br>
least acts accordingly).  Marriage is often shunned by extropians seeking to
<br>
abandon the chains of the past and build an exciting new high-tech future.
<br>
Many long-term couplings amongst extropians might not take on the form of
<br>
marriage as a result.
<br>
<p>All in all, there is a very low probability of any two extropians of
<br>
opposite sexes meeting each other, much less falling in love and choosing to
<br>
commit to marrige.
<br>
<p>However, none of this is grounds to abandon the idea of a life-long
<br>
committed relationship with a member of the same or opposite sex.  Nobody
<br>
said you have to conform to all the rules implied by marriage in our
<br>
culture, and one's brain is greatly enhanced by the physical and mental
<br>
stimulation of a steady partner.  So here's what we've done.
<br>
<p>Lauren and I decided to get married while having breakfast at Shoney's
<br>
following an all-nighter working on our Internet business (I found that
<br>
quite romantic, in an extropian sort of way).  Since we already live
<br>
together, have a joint checking account, and are partners in a business, we
<br>
have viewed marriage as a formality.  And our decision to get married was a
<br>
decision to go through the legal formality of marriage in order to derive
<br>
the benefits our legal system and culture give to married couples.
<br>
<p>We're going to sign the papers at the courthouse and take care of the legal
<br>
formality now.  When we've got enough money to throw a decent party, we'll
<br>
take care of the ceremonial aspect of marriage--which can be cool if done
<br>
right.
<br>
<p>We practice an open relationship, which gives us the freedom to creatively
<br>
explore our sexuality and love with other people without divorce, jealousy,
<br>
regret or any other negatives (except herpes which a good extropian would
<br>
cure).  I think that open relationships would save most marriages, or at
<br>
least make them more fun.  Most extropians don't get married due to aversion
<br>
to monogamy, gayness or social withdrawal.  Open relationships make marriage
<br>
compatible with all but the latter.
<br>
<p>Good luck to you all in finding true extropic love--it's very much worth it.
