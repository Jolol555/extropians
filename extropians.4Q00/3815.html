<em>&gt; &gt;One of the libertarian's favorite slogans is &quot;taxation is theft&quot;, but the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Property is theft? How can anything be &quot;stolen&quot; from anybody when no-one can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own anything?
</em><br>
<p>You own yourself. Thus, your labor belongs to you, and the products of
<br>
it also belong to you. Any material good, resource, etc. that can be
<br>
purchased in free trade with the product of your labor therefore
<br>
represents an extension of you. Thus property rights go hand in hand
<br>
with the abolition of the concept of slavery. If you deny property
<br>
rights, then humans are slaves who do not own themselves and have no
<br>
natural rights. Thus property rights prove the illogic of the following
<br>
statement:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;If you think private property is the basis for hierarchical enslavement of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the masses, you'd say the latter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Private property isnt a &quot;system&quot; as your implying... Its the right to life ,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made concrete. A person needs to make things to stay alive. They need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control items in their environment to not starve to death. The limit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thier action is the boundary of the other person's rights. The &quot;science&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law is the attempt to discover this boundary as clearly as possible.
</em><br>
<p>Uh, no, not quite. Commercial and possibly civil law is as you describe.
<br>
Criminal law is not, it deals with actions that the state has deemed to
<br>
be crimes against the state. When you murder someone and are tried for
<br>
murder, the crime you are tried for is not against the victim, but
<br>
against the 'natural order' that the state imposes, an attempt to deny
<br>
the monopoly of force which the state dictates as its own. Your use of
<br>
force is a violation of their monopoly power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;By what standard is anything judged? My standards aren't accepted by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You premise here is that standards are not objective. I havent met a person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet that doesnt follow the standard of gravity. I can sum up this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonsensical line of thinking this way. If you want to say that the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is subjective, then you just tried to make an objective statment about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe. Naturally this is self contridictory.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, but they do insist that man is artificial. At least they are
<br>
consistent in this.
