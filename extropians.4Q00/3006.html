<em> &gt; &gt; Sounds like we need to go back to the drawing boards to come up with a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Of that, I can honestly say, I had no doubt.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Gah. Let's see who'll be affected. We're talking about digital or
<br>
digitizable content, preferably low-threshold digitizable
<br>
content. We're talking software, music, video, books. 
<br>
<p>Software. I don't care about this too much: I already use OpenSource
<br>
software. In fact I think the world could use more OpenSource
<br>
software, not less of it. Revenues of OpenSource software developers
<br>
can come from support, and in fact they currently do. Look up Ars
<br>
Digita and Zope. Revenues of closed source software developers can
<br>
come (hardware tokens and crypto-authentication, watermark and
<br>
&quot;phone-home&quot;-assisted) licensing and subscription model. I don't see
<br>
software people hurt in the slightest.
<br>
<p>Music. p2p share plus low-threshold small-grain payments will
<br>
noticeably *increase* the total revenues effectively reaching content
<br>
producers, and shift the distribution from few biggies (who will have
<br>
to skip the occasional Ferrari) to less known musicians. Oh my god,
<br>
this will actually increase diversity, on the costs of Britney Spears
<br>
&amp; Co. How very horrible.  Most of the cash flow comes from current
<br>
music pieces, you can as well download the latest opus for a cyberbuck
<br>
from the artist's site directly, instead of napstering the same stuff
<br>
from the network (notice that most stuff on Napster is of inferior
<br>
quality, and that the CD sales are *up*, not down, as a result of free
<br>
advertisement via word of mouth) -- paying in the process, as the
<br>
payment model a la MojoNation is clearly the way to go. A large
<br>
fraction of distributors and marketers will need to learn a new
<br>
trade. You can believe that my heart is bleeding for them.
<br>
<p>Video, this might make production of very expensive movies
<br>
impossible. An alternative fully authenticated reproduction
<br>
infrastructure may be deployed (decryption of movie within the
<br>
unique-key display), provided the user base will accept the subsequent
<br>
loss of privacy. A considerable fraction of users will not. Movie
<br>
industry might see an impact, but this is really difficult to
<br>
predict. I have to admit I'm not caring overmuch either.
<br>
<p>Books: see music. Provided, we're talking about already digitized
<br>
books. Putting paperbacks into a scanner is a chore. I will certainly
<br>
do that to my rarer/out of print volumes, because I expect others to
<br>
do the same. I would really like to hear what Damien Broderick has to
<br>
say about this. He'll be directly affected, after all.
<br>
<p>I have probably overlooked something, as this post is a reflexive
<br>
jerk. Doubtlessly, other people will chime in, and mention stuff I've
<br>
overlooked.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt;   Anyone who has sat through the annoying pledge
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; breaks on PBS will know that it's not easy to get people to pay for
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; something they can get for free.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Further, I predict additional fall-out from attempting to turn an industry
</em><br>
<em> &gt; into a charitable organization: societal de-valuation of the work,
</em><br>
<p>Turn industry into charitable organization? What the fsck are you
<br>
talking about?
<br>
<p>Devaluation of work? An artist wants to produce content which will
<br>
reach the maximum appreciative audience, or so I've thought. It is
<br>
prestige, though you sure don't want to have to be distracted by
<br>
realities of life. I don't think Stephen King will notice much if he's
<br>
to lose 80% of his revenues, unless he's collecting aircraft or
<br>
yachts, or small islands in the Caribean. (Personally I think King
<br>
sometimes writes with the power of a gold bullet plowing through your
<br>
brains, and deserves to be paid (directly. without paying the
<br>
lumberjacks, and the paper pulp, and the printers and the marketing
<br>
weasels and the rest of the merry bloodsucker crew), but that's just
<br>
me).
<br>
<p>So, if your stuff is really widely valued, these single cyberbucks do
<br>
add up. And now and then there's an occasional windfall from a
<br>
maecene. (You're rich, you like the stuff, you want to see more of it
<br>
in future, so what do you do? Fork over the cash, of course). If your
<br>
stuff is not widely read, you can't expect to be able to live from the
<br>
revenue. However, because of the lower threshold of accessibility, you
<br>
can be sure that your content will find the widest possible
<br>
audience. Some of which *will* pay slip you the occasional
<br>
cyberbuck. Which *will* increase your total revenue (by giving you a
<br>
cash trickle instead of having to publish and distribute your stuff on
<br>
your own budget -- this can become real expensive if your audience is
<br>
negligeable).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; subsequent loss of interest, inability to attract strong talent to the field
</em><br>
<em> &gt; (independent of it's profitability.)
</em><br>
<p>I wonder what makes you say that. Remember, we're talking only about
<br>
digital content, not physical objects. Digital content which is craved
<br>
by a considerable fraction of online users, and which has a high cost
<br>
of production. Right off the cuff I can only think of movies. Please
<br>
show up the logics of your analysis, because your results are far from
<br>
being obvious. Mildly put.
