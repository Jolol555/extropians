<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                       November 21, 2000
<br>
<p>STARDUST SPACECRAFT ENCOUNTERS SOLAR FLARE
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick-thinking NASA engineers and scientists helped the 
<br>
Stardust spacecraft survive a close encounter with a storm of 
<br>
high-energy particles from the Sun after a recent solar flare.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stardust, a NASA mission to return samples of a comet, 
<br>
was only 1.4 AU (130 million miles) from the Sun on the 
<br>
afternoon of Wed., Nov. 9.  It was flying at about 20,000 
<br>
kilometers per hour (over 12,000 miles per hour). 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineers from the Stardust team were a little worried, 
<br>
since they had heard that the fourth largest solar flare since 
<br>
1976 was heading toward Earth.  This monster cloud of 
<br>
energized particles was 100,000 times more intense than usual, 
<br>
and it was heading toward Stardust. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The engineers' fears came to pass in the middle of the 
<br>
night, when the solar wind's stream of high-energy protons hit 
<br>
the spacecraft. Its two star cameras, which it uses to control 
<br>
the spacecraft's orientation, got a large dose of energy.  
<br>
Protons from the solar wind electrified pixels in the star 
<br>
cameras, producing dots that the camera interpreted as stars. 
<br>
The 12 brightest images, the ones the spacecraft relied on to 
<br>
point its way, were electrified pixels, which showed up as 
<br>
false stars. Hundreds of these star-like images inundated the 
<br>
star camera's field of view, which meant it could not 
<br>
recognize its attitude in space.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spacecraft did the safest thing it could  it went 
<br>
into standby mode, turning its solar panels toward the Sun and 
<br>
waiting for communication from Earth.  While it was waiting, 
<br>
the spacecraft tried again to determine its attitude by using 
<br>
two different sets of cameras.  It repeatedly turned up 
<br>
hundreds of bogus star-like images. It also switched between 
<br>
electronics systems on either side of the spacecraft.  So 
<br>
Stardust began to slowly rotate in place, pointing its solar 
<br>
panels at the Sun. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flight team didn't hear from Stardust when they tried 
<br>
to communicate with it the next morning. They deduced that the 
<br>
solar flare had caused it to go into standby mode, and they 
<br>
knew that meant the spacecraft would send a signal within 24 
<br>
hours.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists confirmed their theory when they reviewed data 
<br>
from the spacecraft that verified that the problems had begun 
<br>
when the solar flare occurred.  The influence of the proton 
<br>
stream would diminish over the next few days but still posed 
<br>
some danger, so the team left the spacecraft in standby mode 
<br>
until the threat passed. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, November 11th, the flight team reset the 
<br>
first star camera and turned it back on. They used another 
<br>
method of orienting the spacecraft, called inertial measuring 
<br>
units, while they inspected the cameras. Engineers retrieved 
<br>
the last images the camera took before the spacecraft reset 
<br>
itself and saw hundreds of false star images.  Although the 
<br>
camera normally uses a circular area in the middle to take 
<br>
pictures, the proton hits were so strong they even penetrated 
<br>
parts of the camera usually hidden from the light.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday, the Stardust flight team commanded the 
<br>
spacecraft to leave its safe mode. The star camera was back on 
<br>
the job, controlling the orientation of the spacecraft 
<br>
perfectly.  The engineers retrieved more data from Stardust to 
<br>
ensure the entire spacecraft had not been affected by the 
<br>
solar flare.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An image taken days after the solar flare subsided shows 
<br>
that the camera had completely recovered from the proton hits. 
<br>
All the bright objects in the picture can be identified as 
<br>
stars, Jupiter or Saturn.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stardust was launched onto a perfect flight path on Feb. 
<br>
7, 1999 from Cape Canaveral, Fla. The spacecraft is headed for 
<br>
an encounter with Comet P/Wild 2 in 2004. Stardust's mission 
<br>
is to collect samples of dust flying off the comet nucleus, 
<br>
and to collect interstellar particles flowing through our 
<br>
solar system. Stardust will fly back toward Earth in 2006 to 
<br>
drop off the samples in a parachute-equipped return capsule. 
<br>
Stardust, part of NASA's Discovery Program of low-cost, highly 
<br>
focused science missions, is managed by JPL for NASA's Office 
<br>
of Space Science, Washington, D.C.  JPL is a division of the 
<br>
California Institute of Technology. For more information on the
