<p><p>Their cause?  I was under the impression that objective law applied
<br>
equally to all was in everyone's interest.  If we act like it is &quot;our
<br>
cause&quot; then we are guilty according to your lights of fragmenting the
<br>
community and being self-involved.  If we point out that it is simple
<br>
equal rights everyone says we are claiming &quot;special rights&quot;.  Yet out of
<br>
your own mouth you see the call for equality under the law being
<br>
something for us perhaps against others.
