<p>No, he said 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from

Daniken was a moron, and Childhood's End was FICTION. Get over it.

<em>&gt; We don't know this.  I, for one, think that it must be... if this wasn't the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever hard-nosed Carl Sagan proposed something to this effect in &quot;Contact&quot;,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Sagan was showboating buffoon who was doing memetic programming. 
<br>
<p>Supernatural, adj. 1. Existing outside of, or exhibiting properties
<br>
contradictory to the laws of, the natural universe.
<br>
<p>No, transhumans are NOT supernatural. Inhabitants of a Universe Prime, running
<br>
our universe as a quantum simulation, would be supernatural deities, but they
<br>
cannot interfere with the simulation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Capital 'P' Powers are not amazing or incredible, they are merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inscrutable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they're inscrutable, they very well could be amazing and incredible.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know this- nor do I.
</em><br>
<p>incredible: lacking credibility. Sorry, any Power I ever meet would likely be
<br>
very credible in its existence. Overwhelmingly so. It might be amazing, but it
<br>
would not be mystical or supernatural.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Mystics read fantasy, extropians read science fiction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Get it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I read both.  My favorite genera, in fact, is Science Fantasy- Star Wars,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shadowrun, the more recent Final Fantasy games, and several of my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strange concoctions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm one of those strange people who sees no contradiction between being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystical and being scientific (and I don't even need some arcane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation of quantum physics or feel the need to bend the rules of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability to back me up).
</em><br>
<p>Then you need to drop the SF and start reading real science books.
