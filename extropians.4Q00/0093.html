A few months ago we discussed the desirability of providing Internet
<br>
access for rural undeveloped areas.  The following article describes the
<br>
experience in South Africa.
<br>

<p>Author:  Ronel Smith is the Manager of Connectivity Business at e-tek
<br>
(Pty) Ltd, the commercialization vehicle of CSIR Information and
<br>
Communication Technology. The aim of this group is to be a &quot;vibrant
<br>
hothouse for new digital start-up businesses&quot;. Ms. Smith has ten years of
<br>
experience in IT and telecommunications with a specific interest in
<br>
broadband communications. She has been involved in projects ranging from
<br>
the design and implementation of a wireless rural network to a large ATM
<br>
network at one of South Africa's largest universities.
<br>
<p>=============================
<br>
The South African Government has launched a drive to provide Telecentres
<br>
to communities and Internet access to schools. The Telecentres are
<br>
normally centrally located with respect to clusters of schools and other
<br>
community services. In the context of this drive, a Telecentre was
<br>
established in Manguzi, a remote town in the KwaZulu Natal province in
<br>
South Africa. The surrounding schools did not benefit from this centre
<br>
due to the inappropriate distance between the schools and Telecentre. In
<br>
addition, the schools could not be connected to Internet directly due to
<br>
the absence of telephones. In this case study we will show that existing
<br>
&quot;off-the-shelf&quot; technologies were not applicable to the specific
<br>
situation and hence there was a need for a new solution.
<br>
<p>There are unusual challenges in providing Internet connectivity to a
<br>
&quot;sparsely&quot; populated rural community separated by vast distances from
<br>
nearest urban development. This case study details how we combined
<br>
existing Internet access technologies to overcome various obstacles such
<br>
as the lack of existing telecommunications infrastructure, remoteness of
<br>
area, as well as political and economic issues. Furthermore the solution
<br>
implemented had to be cheap, suited to the specific regulatory and
<br>
geographic environment, robust and suitable for a particular application,
<br>
namely Web browsing and e-mail.
<br>
<p>We used the asymmetric nature of the data requirements of the specific
<br>
applications to our advantage, using radio links and satellite broadcast
<br>
technology to provide the required connectivity. We will discuss the
<br>
expected merits of the new solution and its implementation. We will also
<br>
present our practical findings and discuss how it compared to our
<br>
expectations.
<br>
<p>Similar needs and situations exist in other parts of the world,
<br>
especially those that have a lack of telecommunications infrastructure,
<br>
very remote rural areas that are very sparsely populated. We hope that
<br>
the outputs of this paper can contribute to the technology decisions of
<br>
people responsible for rolling out Internet infrastructure in similar
<br>
environments.
<br>
==============================
<br>
<p>Excerpt :
<br>
<p>One of the biggest hurdles to overcome during this project was not
<br>
technological in nature, but related to community support and the
<br>
politics surrounding access provision. In South Africa, rural tribal
<br>
authority politics combined with our particular legislation and
<br>
historical inequalities in access provision makes for an interesting and
<br>
risky mix. It is important to introduce technology with the full buy-in
<br>
and understanding of the community. Everybody concerned should be
<br>
realistic about what can and cannot be achieved with the introduction of
<br>
ICT; it is not an instant cure all ills. 
<br>
Technical support for this project was a major challenge. Because of the
<br>
remoteness of Manguzi (minimum 8 hours by car, or 2 hours by airplane) it
<br>
was not possible to &quot;jump in the car&quot; and go to the site when something
<br>
went wrong. The project had to be planned in the finest detail and
<br>
thoroughly tested before being rolled out at Manguzi. Furthermore it is
<br>
important to have a person on site that is able to do at least first line
<br>
support. The solution (hardware and software configuration) must be
<br>
extremely robust and able to stand up to the rigors of rural life.
