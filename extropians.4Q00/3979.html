</em><br>
<p>OK, but how about if I post them here first so somebody can point
<br>
me to any obvious errors?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or perhaps they are *virtual* envelopes...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We trust you enough that we would only occasionally suspect

</em><br>
<p>HA!  Got you there pardner.  I do my back of the envelope
<br>
calcs in an engineering notebook, which I keep indefinely.  I
<br>
will be happy to show you these next time you are in town.
<br>
As it turns out, my notebook is at work and I am at home,
<br>
but I can reproduce the admittedly rough calc from memory.
<br>
<p>The most disturbing thing I found when doing the calculations
<br>
is that it is not necessarily the interstellarlopers which are
<br>
the problem, its the hydrogen and helium.  This being the
<br>
case, I am not at all confident in my upper bound for the
<br>
abundance of the stuff.  Let us stay with 200 ng/km^3
<br>
for now.
<br>
<p>Assume an interstellar craft with frontal area of 1 km^2.  It
<br>
doesnt matter: the frontal area will cancel.  I just used
<br>
1 km^2 to match my units of 200 nanograms/cubic km.
<br>
<p>Assume the craft travelling at .1c.  A first order estimate
<br>
of the effect of a collision between a two particles is
<br>
made by a conservation of momentum argument:  a
<br>
hydrogen atom (1 AMU) strikes a water molecule (18 AMU)
<br>
and the resultant velocity is proportional to temperature
<br>
of the water.  Conservation of momentum suggests that
<br>
about 4% of the kinetic energy of the hydrogen atom
<br>
is imparted to the water molecule: the rest goes off in
<br>
photons that are not absorbed.  Similarly, if a helium
<br>
atom strikes a water molecule, 4/18 or about 22% goes
<br>
to raise the temperature of water, the rest lost.  If the
<br>
interstellar meduim is 75% hydrodgen and 25 % helium,
<br>
then the kinetic energy of the mixture imparted to raising
<br>
the temperature of the ice is (.22)(.25) + (.75)(.056)=.097
<br>
so about a tenth of the energy in the hydrogen and helium
<br>
is retained in raising the temperature of the ice, the rest lost.
<br>
<p>Mass flux into the shield per unit time is then
<br>
<p>(.1c)*(3E5 km/sec)*(2E-10 kg/km^3) =6E-6 kg/km^2 sec
<br>
<p>So assuming a 1 km^2 frontal area, the absorbed energy
<br>
into the shield is
<br>
<p>(.097)*(.5)*(6E-6 kg/km^2 sec) * (3E4 km/sec)^2 * (1km^2)
<br>
=260 kg km^2/sec^2 = 2.6E8 newton meters.
<br>
<p>A calorie is about 4.2 nm, so 6.3E7 calories per second.
<br>
<p>If the ice shield starts at 20K and the collision energy
<br>
warms it to 273K at about .5 calories per gram, then
<br>
provides heat of fusion, 80 calories per gram, then at
<br>
vacuum vaporization can occur at 273K at 540 cal/g,
<br>
about 3800 calories per gram heat of dissociation when
<br>
the water molecule is torn apart.  Then there is some
<br>
further energy absorption possible in ionization, but let
<br>
us ignore that for now, for conservative calcs.  That means
<br>
the shield absorbs about 4600 calories per gram, or
<br>
about 1100 joules per gram.
<br>
<p>(2.6E8 joules per second) / (1100 joules / gram) = 240 kg/sec
<br>
of the shield lost, so since we started with a square km
<br>
of shield, then
<br>
<p>(240 kg/sec/km^2)* (m^3/900 kg) * (24*3600 sec/day)*
<br>
(km^2/1E6 M^2 )=
<br>
.023 meters per day, or 2.3 cm/day.  For 45 years.
<br>
<p>Please somebody find a major error in my calcs.  I will repeat
<br>
the calcs using tungsten shields of course, but nothing would
<br>
please me more than finding this analysis is completely wrong.
<br>
<p>Well, actually, a peaceful human-loving Singularity, transitioning
<br>
us into a world of unimaginable wealth and wellbeing would
<br>
please me more.  But nullifying this calc would please me second
<br>
most.  spike
