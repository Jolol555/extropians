<p>The Democratic National Committee fabricated the Palm Beach

Controversy prior to the polls even closing in Florida. Here
<br>
are three links those interested in the Palm Beach, Florida,

ballot controversy should follow up on:

<br>
<p>The first link above is an Associated Press wire story about
<br>
how the Democratic National Committee paid the telemarketing
<br>
firm TeleQuest to call 5,000 Palm Beach voters to incite their
<br>
paranoia with the following message:
<br>
<p>“Some voters have encountered a problem today with punch card
<br>
ballots in Palm Beach County. These voters have said that they
<br>
believe that they accidentally punched the wrong hole for the
<br>
incorrect candidate. If you have already voted and think you
<br>
may have punched the wrong hole for the incorrect candidate,
<br>
you should return to the polls and request that the election
<br>
officials write down your name so that this problem can be
<br>
fixed.”
<br>
<p>The TeleQuest callers then took the names and phone numbers of
<br>
voters who said they may have cast an errant ballot and gave
<br>
these names to the Democratic Party.
<br>
<p>Look at the above message very carefully! There is no
<br>
indication that anything was considered wrong with the ballot.
<br>
Further, note that the message explicitly contains the
<br>
blatantly false and misleading statement that one can “fix” an
<br>
incorrect ballot after the ballot has been cast.
<br>
<p>Had the vote in Florida not been close, we would never have
<br>
heard anything about these bizarre telephone calls. But the
<br>
vote was close and now in hindsight their purpose is all too
<br>
clear.
<br>
<p>Only after the votes were tabulated, did the Democratic
<br>
National Committee then construct and pass out the fabricated
<br>
story that the media parroted, concerning the alleged Palm
<br>
Beach ballot being faulty as supposedly reflected in a
<br>
abnormally large number of Buchanan votes. The media should be
<br>
horsewhipped for spreading this pack of lies. In fact:
<br>
<p>Yes- there are more Buchanan votes in Palm Beach County than
<br>
any other Florida County for the simple reason that Palm Beach
<br>
County is, by population, one of the largest counties in
<br>
Florida.
<br>
<p>No- there emphatically is nothing unusual about the Buchanan
<br>
votes in Palm Beach County. Less than 1% of Palm Beach County
<br>
voters voted for Buchanan while there were many other Florida
<br>
counties where more than 1% of the voters did.
<br>
<p>The second link above illustrates how the Democratic National
<br>
Committee, with the assistance of the media, has successfully
<br>
misled almost the entire nation with its unethical use and
<br>
misinterpretation of statistical charts.
<br>
<p>Finally in the third link above the Florida Secretary of State
<br>
makes a clear and unequivocal statement that the Palm Beach
<br>
ballots conformed to the law of the State of Florida. There
<br>
never was anything wrong with the Palm Beach ballots!
<br>
<p>All of us who have ever voted have experienced a natural
<br>
paranoia of wondering if we marked the ballot incorrectly. The
<br>
Democratic National Committee has, in the most cold-hearted,
<br>
dishonest and disgusting way, attempted to prey on this common
<br>
fear and use it as a means of overturning an election result.
<br>
The media needs to be very severely reprimanded for going
<br>
along with this brazen attempt to tamper with an election and
<br>
circumvent the “Voice of the People”.
