<p>
<em>&gt; I have never said I am against empowerment, only urged caution, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asfar as I am aware have always argued for balance.
</em><br>
<p>What dangers do you perceive?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; It is an important topic, and I just wanted to tease more out of it ... am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not really attacking you, or trying to put words in your mouth, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the statements rather more closely than you might like.
</em><br>
<p>I have no objection to close examination-- in fact, I encourage it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If you think truth is a more important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal than utility, make an argument for it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought that is what I have done ... no point in labouring it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too much, it is fairly clear that truth is the better yardstick.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  Truth is an important concept, but is it really the only means
<br>
by which we should measure personal power?  Is truth always the best way to
<br>
achieve increased utility (or whatever goal you decide is worthy?)  And
<br>
further, in the context of this discussion (arbitrarily limiting belief
<br>
structures,) truth is a really fluid concept.  As far as personal
<br>
limitations go, the truth is often what you make it.  Believe in your
<br>
ability to succeed-- you'll make your own truth.  Conversely, self-doubt is
<br>
often self-fulfilling.  For myself, the goal is optimization, and truth is
<br>
often a very valuable means of achieving that-- this is why I often
<br>
reference the need for clear observation.  Learn your environment-- learn
<br>
how the system works, and play the game.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; I repeat, reject ideology because is false, not on grounds that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; limiting.
</em><br>
<p>I'll repeat my point here for clarity:  If Joe holds the belief that he is,
<br>
for instance, unable to talk to women, is that a false belief?  Certainly
<br>
the aspect of JW Betty's ideology that we find limiting is its falsehood--
<br>
she's unlikely to really reap any eternal salvation from her refusal to take
<br>
a transfusion.  However, for many of us (list members) our limiting
<br>
ideologies have less to do with religious dogma, and more to do with the
<br>
particular kinds of fear that our environment imbues us with.  Many of us
<br>
hold beliefs that are 'truth-independent'... self-fulfilling bootstraps with
<br>
regards to our personal capabilities, our society, etc.  This is really what
<br>
I'm talking about.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You interpreted my comments as an evangelical exhortation?  Wow, I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impressed.  This person you're arguing against must be saying some pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radical stuff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the impression you gave, about all the fantastic changes in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life &amp;c.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm... sorry about that, I -do- get a little enthusiastic.  I have been on a
<br>
long journey of awakening to my own potential and it has made me very happy.
<br>
I guess its sort of hard to talk about these sorts of things without coming
<br>
across as Tony Robbins or something.  But there is a great truth here-- we
<br>
humans have power... and for those of us in the First world at least, there
<br>
are endless opportunities to manifest that power (and others, too.)  I am a
<br>
wee bit of an optimist, I admit it.  I do believe there is a way.  I'm not
<br>
talking about any spiritual, philosophical or psychological magic here
<br>
either-- just be awake.  Observe that there are people out there who operate
<br>
on another level-- who understand their empowerment-- who greedily embrace
<br>
life.
<br>
<p>This is the sort of conversation I'd like to have in person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I just wondered how serious you were.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I'm serious baby.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You saying that doesn't make it so.  Let me make my question more clear:
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; what do we refer when we use the word: &quot;humans.&quot;  How is the word &quot;human&quot;
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; belief?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a statement of identity with lot of ideological baggage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I prefer the neutral &quot;humanoid.&quot; &quot;Human&quot; is a belief in the same way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;posthuman&quot; or &quot;extropian&quot; are beliefs/aims/ideology. Its just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;human&quot; is more entrenched in the culture, so seems less conjectural.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not entirely sure why you hold that the word &quot;Human&quot; is a belief-- I'm
<br>
not sure that that's the context in which I most often hear it used.  I call
<br>
myself a human, but for me the word simply references my biological status.
<br>
Deciding to call yourself NOT-human seems arbitrary-- and if that's
<br>
effective for you, then I'm in favor of it.  But is that really a 'truer'
<br>
ideology, or simply a more effective one?  I think we agree here more than
<br>
you'd like to admit...
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Again, this is my attempt to be ironic at your expense.
</em><br>
<p>Why?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;What I basically
<br>
<em>&gt; think is that &quot;I&quot; am the authority on my own identity, rather than any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside observer ... but there is also I feel that the statement is true
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;human&quot; condition/ weakness/ identity is a limiting belief ... and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one that can be &quot;stripped away&quot; or at least &quot;seen through&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I'm in favor of this attitude, although as stated I don't think I find the
<br>
term &quot;human&quot; to be as attached to limiting ideologies as you do.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Your exact phrase was &quot;gobbledegook&quot; ..... so either you have made an
</em><br>
effort
<br>
<em>&gt; to comprehend, and rejected it for some rationale or other ... or you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genuinely unable to understand what it is ... if this is the case I might
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fault for use clumsy or difficult language.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, but I found the paragraph in question to be irrelevant, tangential
<br>
and impenetrable.  I -am- genuinely unable to understand why you introduced
<br>
it.  We should probably let it drop.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I feel it is important enough, in either case, for me to at least make MVT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more explicit so as to devalue &amp; argue against your &quot;gobbledegook&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insult.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry dude, I didn't quite mean it as an insult, but... well, you know how
<br>
it goes.  I perceived the point in question to be a debate tactic and was
<br>
dismissive of it.  Ostensibly I hope to discourage that sort of thing, but I
<br>
recognize in practice that dismissivness is more-often-than-not
<br>
inflammatory.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;If that means destroying the credibility of your own banal and
<br>
<em>&gt; empty proposition, so be it.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure if I've given you enough of a proposition for you to attack its
<br>
credibility.  Certainly you can attack -my- credibility-- for instance, you
<br>
could interview my personal acquaintances in an attempt to challenge my
<br>
claims of personal empowerment.  Or you could review my social, scholastic
<br>
and business performance.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I am an unashamed reductionist philosopher
<br>
<em>&gt; and MVT represents a powerful means of empowerment not just for me, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for anyone else who cares to apply its findings.
</em><br>
<p>I believe you, and I'm pleased you've found results.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Also, you just said you don't trust everyone with personal empowerment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you say you want to: &quot;present them with fuller information so as to make
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;more informed choice.&quot;  How do you reconcile these apparently
</em><br>
contradictory
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;statements?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fuller information process does impose a delay, so eliminates certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rash implementation. Also we should think how our actions affects the
</em><br>
world
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;in the round&quot; rather than just the first, selfish, greedy notion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strikes us.
</em><br>
<p>I agree and I hope you didn't think I was arguing another position.
<br>
<p>By the way, you're hedging, but I'll let it go.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We all have loads of knowledge of psychology ... don't be bamboozled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by ivory tower academics and qualified psychologists ..  hopefully  this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation (even putting aside MVT) might empower you a bit!
</em><br>
<p>That would be a pleasant outcome, although I'm unclear how it might be
<br>
achieved in this case.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; We have &gt; infinite-state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; capability so can think about, or imagine, any environments we want.
</em><br>
Cite
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Leibnitz &quot;all possible worlds.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Can we imagine environments we don't want?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously ..... some people in antiquity invented hell.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, let me rephrase for clarity: &quot;can we imagine environments we don't
<br>
want to imagine?&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does the ability to imagine any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;environments we want = ALL possible environments?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a big academic literature on &quot;all possible worlds,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is too involved and tiresome for discussion here.
</em><br>
<p>I don't need any academic literature to know that there are hypothetical
<br>
environments that have thus far eluded human imagination.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Your 4 points towards self empowerment. I use &quot;quote marks&quot; precisely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think your ideology deserves to be thought of as a theory.
</em><br>
<p>Then let's not call it a theory anymore.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Don't take this conversation too personally ... I am a professional
</em><br>
arguer.
<br>
<p>Yes, I can see that-- indeed, that very sentence proves it.  (Why should I
<br>
take this conversation personally?  You haven't made it personal.)
<br>
<p>You don't need to worry about my feelings unless your intention is to attack
<br>
my personality rather than my ideas.
