<em>&gt; &gt;Until they want a libertarian society, they'll never get it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These are the two most common positions I've observed among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectually mature libertarians.  Libertarian claims are taken to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either be statements of fact or of value.  If they are statements of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value, then it appears that most people just don't share those values,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so a &quot;moral revolution&quot; is required to give people the &quot;right&quot; values.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is right, but to add to this, I'd point out that many
<br>
libertarians (especialy Randian libertarians) take it that questions
<br>
of value are, indeed, questions of fact.  If you think that value
<br>
questions are really fact questions, then when people disagree about
<br>
your values, this is further evidence of widespread stupidity, or, as
<br>
Rand might say, widespread irrationality/insanity.
<br>
<p>Still, I think we can all agree that not all facts are moral facts,
<br>
(assuming that there are any,) and that for libertarianism to succeed,
<br>
most people need to share our moral beliefs in a way that they don't
<br>
now and, as I'll suggest, aren't very likely to in the near future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that there are large differences in value at play here, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think the prospects of a moral revolution in the libertarian direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anytime soon to be small, and similar in magnitude to prospects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral revolutions in opposite directions.
</em><br>
<p>I'd actually say that our odds are quite worse than the odds in favor
<br>
of a moral revolution in the opposite direction.  Socialism, for
<br>
example, is popular because it is in no way a subtle deduction from a
<br>
basic principle.  It's simply a call for &quot;equality,&quot; and a revolution
<br>
to bring about a government to enforce equality by any means
<br>
necessary.
<br>
<p>There is no one-word encapsulation of the libertarian position.
<br>
(Hint: &quot;Freedom&quot; doesn't count.  EVERYBODY uses that one.)  And,
<br>
compared to other philosophies, the libertarian position is actually
<br>
somewhat complex.  &quot;Non-initiation of force&quot; can't be compressed much;
<br>
moreover, its desirability isn't as obviously compelling as a call for
<br>
&quot;freedom&quot; (which is what libertarians normally fall back on) or even a
<br>
call for &quot;equality.&quot;
<br>
<p>The trouble is that &quot;non-initiation of force&quot; leaves out the fun part:
<br>
the libertarian position emphasizes that you can do *whatever you
<br>
want*, except for initiation of force.  But even that's not very sexy.
<br>
Nor does it obviously offer up an attack plan.  As I've argued, while
<br>
socialism tells you what to do: &quot;revolt!&quot; libertarianism requires a
<br>
moral revolution; it requires everyone believing in its rightness and
<br>
voting that way.
