Hi All,
<br>
<p>I've noticed that among the people who post frequently on this list, the
<br>
majority are involved in computer science and nanotec pursuits, as
<br>
opposed to media and other fields. While we have achieved a good deal of
<br>
positive press (Wired, Slashdot, etc.) in the past couple years, I think
<br>
it's time that we organized some more effective
<br>
method of popularizing Extropinistic attitudes and ideas. In short, an
<br>
Extropian Meme Machine. 
<br>
<p>In order to get more minds aware and active in Extropianstic ideas and
<br>
pursuits. Many organizations with fewer members and less valuable purposes
<br>
have very effective PR machines (just think, the extreme christians). Have
<br>
we thought about utilizing more modern forms of PR such as press releases,
<br>
publicity stunts, gurilla media, viral marketing, sending experts to
<br>
media oragnizations arround issues in the news, etc., etc.
<br>
<p>As a media-worker (at least in part), I would be able to add some
<br>
suggestions, strategies, and perhaps some additional resources (mailing
<br>
lists, etc) should the right opportunity arise.
<br>
<p>Any effective ideas?
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; This past weekend, I went back to the site and took the time to read 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through some of the material there.  First, I read Extropian

<em>&gt; Principles 3.0, and I must at very least say, &quot;Wow!&quot;

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular emotion to the group that has elicited it, while it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still fresh in my mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have never in my thirty-two years read any type of statement of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles that so thoroughly agrees with my own outlook on life. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The mix of libertarianism and rationalism combined with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward-thinking goal of using technology to better ourselves in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every way possible sounds too good to be true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm really hoping that what's inside the box is as wonderful as the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrapping paper - and I'll be lurking for quite some time while I try 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to figure that very thing out.  It'll also take me a bit to get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through that recommended reading list - ugh, homework! :)
</em><br>
