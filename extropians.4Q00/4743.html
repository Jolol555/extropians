</em><br>
<p>I'd concur with others Emlyn, if you are eductating her about bacteria
<br>
and she understands them at the age of 5, you are doing a great job
<br>
as a parent.
<br>
<p>Regarding getting a microscope, you might want to consider the Intel
<br>
computer microcam, I think it has a microscope &quot;attachment&quot;, however
<br>
I'm not sure it would be sufficiently powerful to see bacteria.  You
<br>
probably could do yeast which are ~10x bigger or some cyanobacteria
<br>
that you could find in pond water get pretty big.  You will need to
<br>
go to 400x perhaps 1000x to see bacteria if I recall correctly.
<br>
Unfortunately, bacteria being around a micron in size are at the limits
<br>
of far-field visible light microscopy because they are only slightly
<br>
larger than the wavelengths in visible light (400-700 nm).
<br>
<p>To view bacteria most effectively, they also need to be stained.
<br>
Standard microbiology uses an iodine stain, with an alcohol flush
<br>
followed by a safranin stain to differentiate between gram negative
<br>
and gram positive bacteria (they have different cell wall molecules
<br>
that have different stain affinities).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, I've told her about plaque in your mouth, and how it is bacteria 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chomping on your teeth, which are promoted by sugary foods. I could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong about that, I've just been pedalling the standard parent party line. 
</em><br>
<p>Nope, for once the party line is correct.  The bacteria are consuming
<br>
sugar and producing acid that attacks your teeth.  They are proabably
<br>
doing this to provide a pocket in which they can live more safely
<br>
protected from your toothbrushes, bacteriocidins in your saliva,
<br>
roaming macrophages, etc.  They could also be harvesting the minerals
<br>
but I think that would be of lower priority.
<br>
<p>There is a Dentist(molecular biologist?), I believe from Florida,
<br>
who has engineered a strain of Streptococcus mutans (the primary
<br>
culprit in tooth decay along with Streptococcus sobrinus, so that
<br>
it does not produce the decay causing lactic acid.  I believe they are
<br>
intending to take this to clinical trials.  The strategy is to infect
<br>
your mouth preferentially with the &quot;good bacteria&quot; so the bad
<br>
bacteria have a harder time of it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, she knows that sugar is used as a preservative in foods, like jam. 
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; If sugar is a preservative, and stops bacteria from eating food,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why does it cause decay in teeth, which is due to promotion of bacteria? 
</em><br>
<p>The sugar question has been addressed correctly.  At high concentrations
<br>
molecules like sugar and salt function to extract the water from the
<br>
bacteria by osmosis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another piece; she interogated me recently about food rotting; why does it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen? I told her that bacteria eat it. 
</em><br>
<p>That is to some degree true, but only on surfaces exposed to air.
<br>
Internally meat, chicken, eggs, etc. &quot;should&quot; be bacteria free.
<br>
However, the preparation process if not done well, can contaminate
<br>
it with things such as E. coli, Salmonella, etc.  The problem
<br>
involves how to butcher an animal without contaminating the meat with
<br>
the contents of the digestive tract or other surfaces that are likely
<br>
to harbor bacteria.
<br>
<p>Now to some extent cells are always &quot;self-digesting&quot;, there is a good
<br>
article on the &quot;proteosome&quot;, &quot;The Cellular Chamber of Doom&quot;, in
<br>
Scientific American, Jan. 2001, pg 68.  This machine functions to
<br>
break down proteins for recycling.  The typical figure I've seen for
<br>
protein turnover in the liver is ~1%/hr (increasing when you are on
<br>
caloric restriction).  You also have RNAse's and DNAse's that chop up
<br>
RNA and DNA for recycling.  I'd have to dig through the biochemistry
<br>
books for a while to see which of those processes require ATP and since
<br>
I've got other things I need to do today that is left as an exercise
<br>
for the reader :-).  If those breakdown processes are biochemically
<br>
favorable, then they would occur in cells even when the animal is dead.
<br>
Lacking a fresh energy supply (sugar from the bloodstream), new
<br>
proteins and RNA cannot be synthesized (for these do require ATP
<br>
derived from sugar) and thus the cells &quot;eat&quot; themselves.
<br>
<p>The bacteria probably attack from the outside, but the cells
<br>
are probably consuming themselves from the inside as well.
<br>
<p>For those who are really interested in exploring the &quot;nanoworld&quot;,
<br>
culturing of bacteria is a great way to do it.  Its something
<br>
most people on the list should do at sometime or another as
<br>
a self-education exercise.  You need agar plates (something I've
<br>
seen at a local science education store here in Seattle),
<br>
a Bunsen burner of some type (I suppose the real men like Mike
<br>
can use a propane torch...), a glass rod with a metal loop,
<br>
some swabs for collecting and spreading the bacteria on the
<br>
agar plate and transfering them to a microscope slide and
<br>
of course the microscope.  I would have to believe there are
<br>
sites on the net for &quot;Introduction to Microbiology&quot; that explain
<br>
the experimental procedures involved.
<br>
<p>The interesting thing is that bacteria are &quot;almost&quot; everywhere.
<br>
You can leave an agar plate open to the air and you will have
<br>
bacteria of several types growing in it after a few days.
<br>
Then your mouth is a hotbed of bacterial activity.  Even if
<br>
you don't have a microscope, you can grow visible colonies
<br>
on the agar plates.  As Robert (here are the numbers) Freitas
<br>
points out in Nanomedicine, Section 8.5.1, pg 247 (I know
<br>
there are some of you out there that stopped after Chapter 3,
<br>
thus missing some of the &quot;good&quot; parts...), there are ~40 trillion
<br>
foreign organisms, mostly bacteria in or on the human body.
<br>
Given that most of your cells are red blood cells that do not
<br>
contain DNA, this means that there are almost 10x as many
<br>
copies of foreign genomes in your body as there are copies
<br>
of your genome.  Those genomes contain ~10x fewer genes
<br>
(~3-4000 vs. 30-40,000) than your own genome does.
<br>
<p>Well, enough trivia for today.
<br>
<p>Just to satisfy my curiosity, could one or two people confirm
<br>
to me (off-list), that they did in fact see my post re:
<br>
SPACE &amp; Interstellar Travel:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/2511.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/2511.html</a>
<br>
I would have thought it would have drawn more commentary
<br>
but perhaps it just got lost in the holiday chaos.
<br>
