<p>
Just a small nitpick here, butI have to ask a few questions...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Transhumanism without a commitment to extropy is just transhumanism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This can turn into an extropic society, or it can turn out in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dystopic socialist nightmare.
</em><br>
<p>This statement is phrased as an either-or - either one commits to extropy
<br>
OR one ends up with a dystopic future.  I would definitely beg to differ
<br>
here - one could come up was a fairly palatable and reasonable future without
<br>
the sort of committment you bring up.
<br>
<p>Additionally, the use of &quot;socialist&quot; as a synonym for &quot;evil&quot; or at least 
<br>
&quot;extremely undesireable&quot; seems to be more of a personal moral and political
<br>
value judgement.  While I will agree that socialism as currently defined is
<br>
antithetical to libertarianism as it is currently defined, this sort of
<br>
demonization removes a lot of the intellectual weight from the arguement.
<br>
<p>People seemt o be best motivated by fear - which is why the dystopic view of
<br>
the future is the one most prevalent.  The socialist dystopia and the fascist
<br>
dystopia are fairly familiar - but there are also anarchic dystopias, and even
<br>
libertarian dystopias, some of which we have seen presented in mass media.
<br>
(witness the anarchic systems of the Mad Max films, or the semi-libertarian 
<br>
dystopic thread hinted at in Mission Impossible:2 where a single rogue 
<br>
individual could have unleashed an outbreak of a virulent plague created as
<br>
a testbed for a potential cure for most viral ailments.)  (Yes, I realize
<br>
these examples are from films - but they are also from mass-market, POPULAR
<br>
films.  These are the images that percolate in the general public's mind, at
<br>
least here in the US.  Need I mention the implicit technophobia in everything
<br>
I've ever read or seen based on the work of Michael Creighton(sp?)?)
<br>
<p>If one really wishes to bring about an extropic change, one needs to combat 
<br>
ALL these dystopic images and ideas, because they instill a fear of progress,
<br>
technology, and the future in general that can be very difficult to root out.
<br>
If one wants to instill hope, one shouldn't talk about fear in any way that 
<br>
could feed back onto the intended object of hope.
<br>
<p>Hmmm - that was longer than it needed to be.  Time to change the subject and
<br>
start it as a new thread?
