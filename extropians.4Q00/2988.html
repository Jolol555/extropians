<em>&gt; FREE RIDING ON GNUTELLA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ABSTRACT:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An extensive analysis of user traffic on Gnutella shows a significant 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of free riding in the system. By sampling messages on the Gnutella 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; network over a 24-hour period, we established that almost 70% of Gnutella 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; users share no files, and nearly 50% of all responses are returned by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; top 1% of sharing hosts.
</em><br>
<p>Gnutella's woes demonstrate that making a scalable, usable peer to
<br>
peer file sharing system is not as easy as it looks.  In retrospect it
<br>
is amazing that Napster was able to do so well.  Of course the other
<br>
systems are handicapping themselves technologically by trying to avoid
<br>
the centralized servers that make Napster so vulnerable to legal attacks.
<br>
But at this point none of the alternatives appears to have the usability
<br>
that made Napster so successful.
<br>
<p>Gnutella's real problem is network overload, as their broadcast based
<br>
system doesn't scale.  The network is fragmented and transitory, and
<br>
the only reason it's stopped getting worse is that people have largely
<br>
given up on it.  (&quot;Nobody goes there any more, it's too crowded.&quot;)
<br>
<p>Freenet is really still alpha quality software, breaking regularly,
<br>
with still more incompatible changes planned before the 1.0 release
<br>
(hopefully in 2001, but no promises from the core developer (yes,
<br>
there's effectively only one developer)).  The system is designed to be
<br>
scalable, but there is as yet no search mechanism.  It's much harder to
<br>
make searches scale and there is deep dissension about whether and how
<br>
searches can be made to work.
<br>
<p>Mojo Nation is also early alpha and suffers major reliability problems.
<br>
Their economic model doesn't seem to be right for the net: you get paid
<br>
for offering server space, but you have to pay to publish content.
<br>
In other words, content providers pay, while disk space providers
<br>
get paid.  The problem is that disk space is much more available than
<br>
content these days, and as a result there is almost nothing to download in
<br>
the system.  It's the &quot;free rider problem&quot; to the nth degree.  They are
<br>
looking at new design ideas to address this but most of the effort now
<br>
is just in getting the basic system to work stably.
<br>
<p>All these systems are still in active development, and hopefully the
<br>
technical problems can be solved, or at least ameliorated.  It's not clear
<br>
how long this will take, though.  As long as Napster continues to operate
<br>
there is not a sense of urgency on getting these alternative working.
<br>
<p>There are a dozen or more other P2P systems out there that I don't know
<br>
anything about.  This fragmentation is itself a problem because these
<br>
systems have to reach critical mass to be useful.
<br>
