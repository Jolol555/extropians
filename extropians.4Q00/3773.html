<em>&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Reason +/-Faith
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What is the creation impulse without the destructive urge?  What is life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;without death?  What is a beginning without an ending?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see that the Great Myth is being propogated again: the lie that because
</em><br>
we
<br>
<em>&gt; see these dichotomies that they are necessary -- and not merely necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but also good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is the creative impulse with the destructive urge?  It is the
</em><br>
creative
<br>
<em>&gt; impulse.  What is life without death?  It is life.  What is a beginning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without an ending.  It is a beginning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To demand that every thesis must meet its antithesis is the sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement that sounds philosophically deep but which, really, is nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than a profound failure of the imagination.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Moreover, I think it's a predilection shaped by the current &amp; historical
<br>
inevitability of death; the feeling that a beginning must pair with an
<br>
ending. All our drama, our art, is shaped by it. Culturally, the life/death
<br>
dicotomy shapes everything we do. I wonder if this explains a lot of the
<br>
opposition that is put up against Transhumanist ideas, from people with an
<br>
arts-based academic background?
<br>
<p>This is possibly the number one reason for the resistance to the explicit
<br>
transhumanism that we peddle, particularly with life-extension. It doesn't
<br>
seem &quot;right&quot;; where's the dramatic truth in a life without death?
<br>
<p>I find that people who have a problem with the general idea, that people
<br>
don't need to die, have no problem accepting it in their own specific
<br>
cases - no one particularly wants to die, themselves. Many people will tell
<br>
you that death is necessary for life, that it is part of the grand plan or
<br>
some such rot. Funnily enough, they don't say the same thing at the funeral
<br>
of someone close to them. And, with death staring them in the face, the tune
<br>
changes dramatically.
<br>
<p>On public attitudes to life extension, I think there isn't really any issue.
<br>
No one really wants to die, or if they do, they make it happen. The group
<br>
may resist life extension, but individuals will embrace any hope of longer
<br>
life, especially as &quot;their time&quot; draws near.
