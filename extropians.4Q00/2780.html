The problem with public &quot;reinterpretation&quot; of scientific data and/or
<br>
progress is that it loses so much in the translation that it ends up
<br>
creating grossly distorted impressions.  This is an attempt to inject

some &quot;reality&quot; into the discussion

<em>&gt;Want to live to 200? Being a cyborg has advantages    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By GARRY BARKER
</em><br>
<em>&gt;TECHNOLOGY REPORTER
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sunday 5 November 2000
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;If quantum theories develop into practical computing, machines may begin to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emulate and then surpass human intelligence. 
</em><br>
<p>Poppycock!!  Everyone loves to invoke &quot;quantum computing&quot; as a requirement
<br>
for computers surpassing human intelligence.  There are *two* problems
<br>
with this.
<br>
<p>First it isn't necessary.  Existing trends in microelectronics will get
<br>
us petaflops (10^15 Ops) computing with IBM's Blue Gene within a few years.
<br>
Estimates of human brain calculation equivalence range from 10^13 Ops
<br>
(Moravec, 1987) to 10^17 Ops (McEachern, 1993), so a petaflops is in
<br>
the ballpark.  Special purpose hardware (Pact GmBH's multiply &amp; accumulate
<br>
chips or Hugo de Garis's neural network machines) will put us at desktop
<br>
equivalence of the human brain by 2005 and 2010.  However as work by de Garis
<br>
and Doug Lenat (@ Cyccorp) have shown, the problem is *not* hardware equivalence.
<br>
Its figuring out good ways of programming the net.  You have to bear in
<br>
mind that it takes 2-6 *years* of full time learning for a human brain
<br>
&quot;net&quot; to program itself so it is interesting to interact with.  Even if you
<br>
had lots of human equivalent desktop machines by 2010, it is a very open
<br>
question at this point how long it would take them to &quot;learn&quot; enough to
<br>
be considered &quot;intelligent&quot;.  Now, the interesting thing about resident
<br>
computer intelligence is that you can copy it from machine to machine
<br>
much faster than you can propagate it among humans.
<br>
<p>The second thing about quantum computing that people MUST remember is
<br>
that I have seen nothing that says it can be used for &quot;general purpose&quot;
<br>
computing.  Charles H. Bennet from IBM Research who is one of the world's
<br>
leading experts on the physics of computation, wrote a paper in 1994
<br>
entitled &quot;Strengths and Weaknesses of Quantum Computing&quot;.  People should
<br>
listen to the *experts* in a field such as leading physicists, not the
<br>
popularizers such as Kurzweil (a programmer), or worse yet newspaper reporters.
<br>
<p>The bottom line is that different computer architectures will be useful
<br>
for very different problems.  Multiply&amp;accumulate or neural-net based
<br>
computers may be useful for &quot;fuzzy&quot; intelligence.  Cellular automata like
<br>
machines (e.g. Blue Gene) may be best for simulations.  Quantum or DNA
<br>
computers may be best for factoring or solving traveling salesman problems.
<br>
<p>It requires discipline not to use buzz terms like &quot;quantum computers&quot;
<br>
in an area where they may be inappropriate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The question is whether the enormous power of quantum computers will allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them to learn human levels of logic, reason and innovation. Could they, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example, feel love, hate and compassion? In short, will a computer's brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have what in humans we call a mind?
</em><br>
<p>Love, hate &amp; compassion are hard-wired into humans at the genetic,
<br>
neurological and biochemical levels.  I believe the leading candidate
<br>
for the &quot;love&quot; drug currently may be oxytocin but other factors are
<br>
probably involved.  If we &quot;program in&quot; or &quot;select for&quot; traits that
<br>
create human or &quot;mind&quot; like characteristics in our computers, cyborgs
<br>
or robots, the answer is *yes* they will have minds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ray Kurzweil, another eminent American technologist, is more gloomy. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt;predicts that human identity will be called into question by the massive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computers of the future. 
</em><br>
<p>Human &quot;minds&quot; can evolve and adapt.  Human bodies will become irrelevant
<br>
in the long term.  Because human bodies cannot avoid local hazards
<br>
(earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, etc.) bodies will eventually be
<br>
irreparably damaged.  The interim period, which could well last
<br>
thousands of years depending on how &quot;attached&quot; we remain to our
<br>
bodies, will be one of gradual uploading as human minds expand
<br>
within computer hardware (perhaps not unlike how the developing
<br>
brain of a fetus or young baby expands within its growing head).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By 2020, a mere two decades from now, technology will be producing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computers faster and more powerful than the human brain.
</em><br>
<p>As pointed out above, we will get this by 2005-2010.  There is no
<br>
guarantee however that we will be able to program or teach them to
<br>
have human like intelligence by 2020 or even 2030.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But computing power is only part of the story. It is the networks that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really give computers their potent and omnipotent future.
</em><br>
<p>This is critical -- in the brain it is *not* the raw processing power
<br>
that creates much of the capacity, it is the communications bandwidth
<br>
between all of the computational nodes (neurons).  It is a very open
<br>
question when we will be able to build computing logic elements that
<br>
have the number of raw inputs and outputs that the brain has.  Matching
<br>
the communications throughput of the brain is probably a much more
<br>
significant barrier for some aspects of intelligence than matching
<br>
its processing power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;About 2050 or so, says Mr Kurzweil, the computers, by then capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasoning for themselves, could decide we humans are too slow, too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ignorant, too petty and too argumentative to be tolerated. 
</em><br>
<p>Poppycock again.  If you link the humans to the computers using the
<br>
technologies discussed (neural implants and high bandwidth radio
<br>
or fiber connections), then you can't create such a simple dividing
<br>
line between artificial minds and human minds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why would a computer wish to associate with us?
</em><br>
<p>Why would a human want a frail human body if it could do away with it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just as we have allowed the information age to create increasingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divided societies of haves and have-nots, so will it be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we humans who will create a future of cyborgs and mega-computers. 
</em><br>
<p>Self-replicating systems based on biotechnology will solve much of the
<br>
&quot;have-not&quot; problem.  Full blown molecular nanotechnology is not required.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Mr Kurzweil quotes Daniel Hillis, a noted computer engineer: &quot;I'm as fond
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of my body as anyone else, but if I can be 200 with a body of silicon, I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take it.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>If the problem of aging is resolved through the clever application
<br>
of first biotechnology and then nanotechnology, then the average
<br>
lifespan determined by the U.S. present day accident rate would
<br>
be ~2000 years.  Who would want to live 2000 years without being
<br>
able to grow and evolve beyond the limitations of a standard-issue
<br>
human brain?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Then, are you a human or a computer, and who's side are you on?
</em><br>
<p>Its always easy to cast as &quot;us&quot; vs. &quot;them&quot;.  Instead we merge as the
<br>
humans who are not too afraid to evolve, do so, perhaps in the
<br>
end choosing to leave the planet to those who choose not to do so.
