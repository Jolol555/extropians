&lt;&lt;But it begs the question, that if consciousness isn't, and a copy
<br>
is the original in all functional senses, then what is the point of
<br>
uploading, or a quest for immortality, or anything, really?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Uploading, immortality, and anything else that eventuates, can come
<br>
in handy for answering begged questions. Who knows how long that
<br>
might take.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;If you personally want to be immortal (or indefinitely long lived,
<br>
anyway), you are making a statement about yourself. If consciousness
<br>
isn't, if your self isn't, then what is it that you are trying to
<br>
preserve? Your description? A state of the universe where some being
<br>
traceable back to your original DNA is alive? Why?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>With uploading and immortality, each unique brain can preserve
<br>
itself (not merely a description of itself), because it wants to
<br>
know why... why there is anything rather than nothing.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;If there is no self, what is the motivation to defeat death, on a
<br>
personal level, and continue?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It's not just a matter of defeating death. It's also a matter of
<br>
defeating all that goes with death: The loss of knowledge,
<br>
experience, memory, relationships, etc.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&lt;Why is personal preservation more important than, for instance,
<br>
the preservation of the species?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Personal preservation, on a large scale, equates to preservation of
<br>
the species.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Why wouldn't you support research which would create DNA for an
<br>
indefinitely lived next generation, rather than uploading, where you
<br>
are trying to preserve the current generation?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Uploading does not preclude creation of an indefinitely lived next
<br>
generation. Both are worthy of extropians.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&lt;&lt;Isn't the quest to make future generations long lived far easier
<br>
to attain than that to preserve existing (and crumbling)
<br>
phenotypes?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It may require preservation of existing phenotypes to create long
<br>
lived future generations. How sad to think that scientists working
<br>
on such projects might die before completing their work.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Dennetites, who are also for life extension, what is your
<br>
motivation?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>To outlive the luddites who want to subvert life extension.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
