AT&amp;T vows no censorship on new network
<br>

<br>
<p>Ma Bell has opened the digital doors to an online system designed to let
<br>
Web surfers publish any content without fear of censorship.
<br>
<p>Dubbed Publius after one of the founding fathers' Federalist Paper
<br>
pseudonyms, the system promises to be one of the strongest tools yet
<br>
designed to protect anonymous publishing online. The software allows anyone
<br>
with a Web browser to post a file online, with almost no fear of being
<br>
traced or of having the content removed from the system without permission.
<br>
<p>The network adds to a growing number of network technologies designed to
<br>
protect content from interference by corporate or government forces.
<br>
<p>All of these systems have come under fire from critics who charge they
<br>
could be used by criminals to exchange information or to post dangerous
<br>
content online such as bomb-making instructions or child pornography, for
<br>
example. Ideas for trimming back online anonymity have emanated repeatedly
<br>
from circles such as record executives and international policymakers in
<br>
recent months.
<br>
<p>But the AT&amp;T developers say those risks are worth taking, in order to
<br>
protect free speech.
<br>
<p>&quot;The ultimate kick for us as developers is if some organization such as
<br>
Amnesty International starts to refer people to our systems,&quot; said Avi
<br>
Rubin, the AT&amp;T Labs researcher who is leading the project. &quot;We'd like to
<br>
see it used in the real world, by real world people who can't express their
<br>
ideas.&quot;
<br>
<p>Official announcement of the launch will come tomorrow, according to an
<br>
AT&amp;T Labs spokesman.
<br>
<p>Because it allows free distribution of files online, without any checks by
<br>
copyright owners or law enforcement, Publius has been talked about in the
<br>
same breath as Napster, Gnutella and Freenet.
<br>
<p>But the designers hope this won't be the focus for the system and have
<br>
built in a few safeguards.
<br>
<p>At least in its first release, the system will accept documents only 100
<br>
kilobytes in size--much too small to accept an MP3 or video file.
<br>
<p>And unlike Napster, the Publius system does not have a search feature. Easy
<br>
searches are partly what have made file-sharing systems such as Napster so
<br>
popular so quickly.
<br>
<p>In order to reach a file, a Publius surfer must have access to the file's
<br>
complicated URL. The Publius project will provide a list of files it
<br>
considers interesting, but this will not include music, pornography or
<br>
anything else deemed &quot;uninteresting.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;We don't view this as censorship,&quot; Rubin said. &quot;We view what we're doing
<br>
as a directory for things we think are interesting. For now, people
<br>
publishing content on the system will have to email URLs and descriptions
<br>
of their files to be included, although a search feature might be added in
<br>
a later version, Rubin added.
<br>
<p>That's been enough to win praises from anti-censorship groups, some of whom
<br>
are actually hosting Publius servers during the trial project.
<br>
<p>&quot;We think the way this system is set up goes a long way towards helping
<br>
individuals voice their opinions and protecting democratic values,&quot; said
<br>
Ari Schwartz, a policy analyst with the Center for Democracy and
<br>
Technology, a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying group. The center is one of
<br>
the groups hosting a server for AT&amp;T's trial project.
<br>
<p>Rubin says AT&amp;T has supported his project completely--an important factor
<br>
given an environment where America Online shut down a similar internal
<br>
development effort that produced the Gnutella file-swapping technology.
<br>
<p>The Publius system can be compared to a jigsaw puzzle, in which the entire
<br>
picture can't be seen until all of the pieces have been put together.
<br>
<p>When a document is published on the Web using Publius, the software
<br>
scrambles the file using nearly unbreakable encryption technology and then
<br>
distributes this jumbled set of data to a large number of Web servers in
<br>
the network.
<br>
<p>In order to recreate the original document, a reader must put together a
<br>
predetermined number of &quot;shares&quot; or &quot;keys&quot; to unlock the document. These
<br>
keys are found inside the URL, or Web address of each published document.
<br>
Each URL might contain a coded reference to 10 or more Web servers that act
<br>
as keys; if three or more of these can be found the document will be
<br>
unlocked. If not, then the document is lost.
<br>
<p>This system allows a large number of the servers hosting the document to be
<br>
shut down without blocking the document's retrieval, as long as the minimum
<br>
number of keys can be found.
<br>
<p>In the initial test of the service, AT&amp;T Labs has attracted about 40
<br>
volunteers to host Publius servers and plans to reach about 10,000 files.
<br>
The number of servers will expand later as the system works into a final
<br>
release.
