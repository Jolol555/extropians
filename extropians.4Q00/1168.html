</em><br>
Another, possible view into this question may be that
<br>
impending death brings on a sense of powerlessness,
<br>
which is only curable by basically telling everyone
<br>
how to be you- I think that people who are dying fear
<br>
losing control over their environment-somewhat
<br>
paradoxically, admittedly, since it won't be their
<br>
environment much longer, but I think the brain's
<br>
complete knowledge of what to do at death is actually
<br>
stemming from it's inability to recognize so much what
<br>
death really is.  Either that, or it's realization
<br>
that if it passes on enough of it's memetic systems,
<br>
so to speak, then it will still maintain some control
<br>
over the environment even after it is gone- sort of
<br>
like an anti-ghost.  Where a ghost (if it existed)
<br>
would still see the world and move through it, but not
<br>
touch (at least, according to some mythos), a memetic
<br>
ghost would touch the world blindly, executing
<br>
commands through other people, who will hopefully not
<br>
be so blind.
<br>
Sometimes I imagine our culture growing senescent from
<br>
all this dead tissue, but I think the fear is
<br>
unfounded.  We've got some rather good trimming
<br>
mechanisms for knowledge that isn't important to us. 
<br>
You may still remember how to sew, but you might not
<br>
remember the face of the great grandmother that taught
<br>
you, or whatever.
