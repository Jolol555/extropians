<em>&gt; Oh, don't tempt us to answer that!  It probably ended because you knew too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little to fully appreciate it.  It appears the lack has not been corrected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsequently.   Or do you just prefer infallible popery?   I know, I know,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are actually a total relativist so you can't be pinned down on
</em><br>
anything
<br>
<em>&gt; you may say, do or think or in any wise be held accountable for any of
</em><br>
your
<br>
<em>&gt; uncountable opinions.  You prefer to be walking vapor-person.  Have fun.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, believe me, I had learned enough.  I'd learned enough to know that it
<br>
really doesn't matter a bit.  I began to look in the mirror and realize that
<br>
tomorrow, I will die.  It doesn't matter if tomorrow is tomorrow, if
<br>
tomorrow is sixty years, or if tomorrow is sixty million years- I will die.
<br>
In the end, the dream is over.  In the end, it's all just opinion.  There is
<br>
no truth unless it is created, and no laws except the ones we impose.
<br>
Fantasy is merely reality without inhibitions.  As for being a &quot;walking
<br>
vapor-person&quot;, I seem to be more aware of the nature of life than the people
<br>
I seem to meet and work with every day, who actually think that they're
<br>
accomplishing something!  Or that, perhaps, they are right about something!
<br>
Yet, I'm afraid, everyone is wrong.  Everyone is, essentially, a walking
<br>
corpse, a doomed machine thinking that they actually have this fiction
<br>
called &quot;free will&quot;.
