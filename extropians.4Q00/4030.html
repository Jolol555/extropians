</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  I have only heard one rationale for hate crimes that even 
<br>
makes sense, and even then I don't know if it is a good 
<br>
implementation.
<br>
<p>The question is why should the motivation for a crime make the 
<br>
punishment worse?  The answer was that perpetrators of hate crimes 
<br>
are more likely to repeat the offense.  A man who finds another man 
<br>
in bed with his wife and kills him, may be unlikely to find himself 
<br>
in that same situation in the future.  Whereas the KKK member who 
<br>
lynches a random black man as a signal to the community is probably 
<br>
more likely to be a threat in the future.  The premeditation factor 
<br>
increases the severity of the crime, like premeditated murder is 
<br>
worse than involuntary manslaughter.  Likewise, the choosing of a 
<br>
stranger from a target makes future crimes more likely.  Also, the 
<br>
targeting function adds a factor of terrorism into the mix by 
<br>
identifying a whole group of citizens rather than a specific 
<br>
individual.
<br>
<p>This explanation makes enough sense that I can respect the intent. 
<br>
However, outlawing motives or thoughts is a slippery slope, however. 
<br>
Extending it to minor crimes like resisting arrest or insulting a 
<br>
police officer, seems to be an extreme overreaction.  It also seems 
<br>
unfair to judge a criminal on potential future crimes, although we do 
<br>
this with pedophiles, drug users and repeat felons.
