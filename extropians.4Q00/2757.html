Charter of Fundamental Rights of EU
<br>
[Adopted by EU Parliament, november 2000, the 14th]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Please read article 3 (and 13)*
<br>
<p>PREAMBLE
<br>
<p>The peoples of Europe, in creating an ever closer union among them, are
<br>
resolved to share a peaceful future based on common values. Conscious of its
<br>
spiritual and moral heritage, the Union is founded on the indivisible,
<br>
universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity; it is
<br>
based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law. It places the
<br>
individual at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship
<br>
of the Union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice.
<br>
<p>The Union contributes to the preservation and to the development of these
<br>
common values while respecting the diversity of the cultures and traditions
<br>
of the peoples of Europe as well as the national identities of the Member
<br>
States and the organisation of their public authorities at national,
<br>
regional and local levels; it seeks to promote balanced and sustainable
<br>
development and ensures free movement of persons, goods, services and
<br>
capital, and the freedom of establishment. To this end, it is necessary to
<br>
strengthen the protection of fundamental rights in the light of changes in
<br>
society, social progress and scientific and technological developments by
<br>
making those rights more visible in a Charter.
<br>
<p>This Charter reaffirms, with due regard for the powers and tasks of the
<br>
Community and the Union and the principle of subsidiarity, the rights as
<br>
they result, in particular, from the constitutional traditions and
<br>
international obligations common to the Member States, the Treaty on
<br>
European Union, the Community Treaties, the European Convention for the
<br>
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Social Charters
<br>
adopted by the Community and by the Council of Europe and the case law of
<br>
the Court of Justice of the European Communities and of the European Court
<br>
of Human Rights.
<br>
<p>Enjoyment of these rights entails responsibilities and duties with regard to
<br>
other persons, to the human community and to future generations.
<br>
<p>The Union therefore recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out
<br>
hereafter.

<p>GENERAL PROVISIONS
<br>
<p>Article 51
<br>
Scope
<br>
1.  The provisions of this Charter are addressed to the institutions and
<br>
bodies of the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to
<br>
the Member States only when they are implementing Union law. They shall
<br>
therefore respect the rights, observe the principles and promote the
<br>
application thereof in accordance with their respective powers.
<br>
2.  This Charter does not establish any new power or task for the Community

<br>
<p><p>Article 52
<br>
Scope of guaranteed rights

1.  Any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by
<br>
this Charter must be provided for by law and respect the essence of those
<br>
rights and freedoms. Subject to the principle of proportionality,

limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet
<br>
objectives of general interest recognized by the Union or the need to
<br>
protect the rights and freedoms of others.
<br>
2.  Rights recognised by this Charter which are based on the Community
<br>
Treaties or the Treaty on European Union shall be exercised under the
<br>
conditions and within the limits defined by those Treaties.

<br>
guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
<br>
Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those rights shall be the
<br>
same as those laid down by the said Convention. This provision shall not
<br>
prevent Union law providing more extensive protection.
<br>
<p><p>Article 53
<br>
Level of protection
<br>
Nothing in this Charter shall be interpreted as restricting or adversely
<br>
affecting human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognised, in their
<br>
respective fields of application, by Union law and international law and by
<br>
international agreements to which the Union, the Community or all the Member
