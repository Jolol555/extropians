<em>&gt; I admit I'm a bid superstitious on this topic. John and I have

gone back
<br>

</em><br>
scan
<br>
<em>&gt; producing a copy that is indistinguishable from the original
</em><br>
avoids what
<br>
<em>&gt; happens when the original is not, in fact, destroyed during a
</em><br>
scan, so
<br>
<em>&gt; while the copy may be as good as the 'real thing', there is
</em><br>
something
<br>
<em>&gt; basically counter-intuitive to the idea that my uploaded copy is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indistinguishable from ME, or is me for all practical purposes.
</em><br>
<p>A living copy of you instantly becomes distinguishable from you as
<br>
the copy begins to register its own individual environment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The way I get around the squeamishness of blithely zapping the
</em><br>
original,
<br>
<em>&gt; or having to deal with leftovers is to embrace the 'soft upload'
</em><br>
as the
<br>
<em>&gt; only true 'transfer of conciousness', where the individual
</em><br>
augments
<br>
<em>&gt; their mind with artificial components to such a degree that
</em><br>
eventually
<br>
<em>&gt; the biological component dies but is not missed by the concious
</em><br>
entity.
<br>
<p>You've identified an important difference between the upload and the
<br>
original: The upload is potentially immortal. That obviously changes
<br>
things, and no doubt previous discussions have mentioned this
<br>
difference. As for augmenting and enhancing the original so that it
<br>
morphs into a newly &quot;conscious&quot; being, that happens with ordinary
<br>
100% biological humans as well. Except that the &quot;consciousness&quot; of a
<br>
20-year-old human surpasses by a long shot the &quot;consciousness&quot; of a
<br>
20-month-old human. With the advent of super-intelligence, I foresee
<br>
the assimilation of ordinary human awareness into a more accurate
<br>
and comprehensive version of The Big Picture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is tantamount to taking a '57 Chevy and slowly replacing parts:
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; alternator, the points, the carb, the muffler, the head, etc. At
</em><br>
some
<br>
<em>&gt; point in the future, there will be no original parts on it, but
</em><br>
its
<br>
<em>&gt; history, its provenance, makes it a superior vehicle to one that
</em><br>
has
<br>
<em>&gt; been reproduced by some CAD/CAM system from scans of original
</em><br>
parts.
<br>
<em>&gt; With a body infested with nanites whose job is the slow
</em><br>
replacement of
<br>
<em>&gt; dying neurons with artificial substitutes is analogous to this.
</em><br>
<p>You describe a worthy analogy. I'd extend this to include a more
<br>
radical transition from automobiles to jet aircraft or rockets. The
<br>
atoms of a '57 Chevy could be rearranged to build a rotary
<br>
spacecraft. With sufficient intelligence and self-organization, an
<br>
uploaded entity would look upon phlogiston/consciousness/identity
<br>
with an augmented sense of humor. After all, it is not we, but
<br>
rather uploaded SI, that will have to deal with the Singularity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can much easier accept that the resulting entity eventually
</em><br>
living
<br>
<em>&gt; totally on an artificial substrate is a 'human' that is aware than
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; mere scanned upload.
</em><br>
<p>I see what you mean, and I agree that the path to posthumanity seems
<br>
more likely to involve super-augmentation rather than digitized
<br>
replication.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do I think they are inferior to soft uploads? Not necessarily. How
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; they be any different from an AI grown from scratch on artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrates? Likely little except the AI would likely have far less
</em><br>
junk
<br>
<em>&gt; code involved. I am just not sure if following that route would
</em><br>
retain
<br>
<em>&gt; the ME-ness of ME.
</em><br>
<p>Another advantage to your soft uploads is that they could retain
<br>
enough of the human perspective that they would be able to relate to
<br>
un-augmented humans, so that the evolutionary line would not be
<br>
broken (thus providing a buffer for Singularity). Considering what
<br>
the me-ness of me has accomplished, I don't fear relinquishing it in
<br>
favor of a super-me. But that's probably the voice of an
<br>
underachiever speaking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is likely a significant solipsistic conceptual stumbling
</em><br>
block, one
<br>
<em>&gt; that is entirely 'in my head'. I don't deny it. This is likely
</em><br>
true.
<br>
<p>Selective Uploading could get around this. I mean, just upload the
<br>
non-conflicted patterns contained in the brain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, anything that would make me comfortable going through
</em><br>
such a
<br>
<em>&gt; transition ought to be attempted, if only to make such a procedure
</em><br>
more
<br>
<em>&gt; acceptable to the population at large, and to make the resulting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities more likely to be treated as 'human' by the rest of
</em><br>
humanity.
<br>
<p>Yeah, well &lt;snickering out load&gt; if I actually got the chance to go
<br>
through a transition from human to posthuman, it would not matter to
<br>
me how the rest of humanity treated this It couldn't matter. If it
<br>
mattered, then uploading probably would get squelched by the rest of
<br>
humanity. But since the rest of humanity (by the time uploading
<br>
becomes feasible), would have already queued up for it, transitional
<br>
humans would likely be treated as the In Crowd.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This would likely help reduce greatly the amount of support for
</em><br>
luddites
<br>
<em>&gt; who would oppose granting civil rights to such entities, which can
</em><br>
only
<br>
<em>&gt; be to the good.
</em><br>
<p>As I envision uploading, uploaded entities would be in position to
<br>
transcend civil rights and the constellation of concepts that has
<br>
brought about civil rights. Uploaded entities won't have civil
<br>
rights, they'll have stellar rights; for they have the stars to
<br>
reach.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux is whether you find value in intelligence.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, then the physical forces that we are familiar
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with today have the ultimate say, and humankind is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ephemeral and of no significance -- even to itself.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In which case, one then runs against Molloyism and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;embraces nihilism -- a different kettle of fish indeed.
