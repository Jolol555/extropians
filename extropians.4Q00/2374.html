</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the same day guarrantees that only one or two candidates could
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of a primary, as only Bush would have had the funds to get

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;candidates that are not bought and paid for by the multinationals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to gain exposure and gives people real choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I already pointed out, here in Illinois we did NOT get a choice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or at least a very poor one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no reason that all the candidates can't be allowed to

<em>&gt; participate in a debate or question or answer type session under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Universal access requirements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then the Borda style primary, followed by the conventions, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The current system is okay for New Hampshire, it seriously degrades
</em><br>

<p>How about this, all the campaign promises are collated and delivered to
<br>
the winner on inauguration.  Then, if they're not in place at the end of
<br>
the year, the other guy gets the office, or we just put in a notary.
<br>
<p>I was just thinking that in most states more than %5 over every sales
<br>
transaction is an appended tax.  That must be quite a chunk of change.
<br>
It is a very regressive tax, as are taxes on gasoline, alcohol, and
<br>
tobacco.  I believe the other descriptions of taxes in those terms are
<br>
proportional and progressive.
<br>
<p>The federal government makes most of its money off of income taxes.
<br>
Both candidates have offered income tax cuts, yet the executive doesn't
<br>
have the power to make tax cuts.  Programs that are costing large
<br>
amounts of money could probably be streamlined in terms of efficiency
<br>
and thrift, if we knew where the money went.  The budget is on the CBO
<br>
web page or something, but it doesn't say where the money goes.
<br>
<p>The government should take a one time balance sheet charge to pay off
<br>
the debt, although that might slam its stock.
<br>
<p>After that, then, we can start charging all the other countries that use
<br>
our military.  Also, international intellectual property that belongs to
<br>
the people of the U.S. should be heartily protected, although technology
<br>
transfer is a good thing overall, what with R&amp;D being the predictor of
<br>
growth.  Defense spending can still be quite high after being cut by a
<br>
third, which would be a third of twenty-five percent of the government
<br>
budget.  Growth is about R &amp; D, which means bigs planes, lasers,
<br>
supercolliders, and space, as well as small science, even very small
<br>
science.
<br>
<p>(Ramble.)
<br>
<p>Have a nice day,
<br>
<p>Ross
