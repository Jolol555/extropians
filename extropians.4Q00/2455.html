<p>
I'm not going to quote it here - but let me being with a hearty &quot;me too!&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, to try and clarify some of those questions, let me try to repose them, and
<br>
add a few of my own.
<br>
<p>(a) What are we doing to extend both the quantity and quality of our lives?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this I mean - there's a lot of diet information out there, exercise,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nutrition, supplements, etc.  What of it works, and what's bunk?  What
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are we all doing, colelctively and as individuals, to try and extend
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and enhance our own biological lives so that we are well enough to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take advantage of the better life extension technology down the line?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are the threads on nutrition, etc.?  I don't see them much, but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would imagine this is one of the core things we can do, as individuals
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today, to assure we live to see more of the future, instead of waiting 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for some technological savior to come and uplift us from our unhealthy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lives.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, some of th ebest advice I've gotten on health, nutrition,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exercise, etc. comes from one of those mystic, green types that seem to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be generally denigrated around here.  Maybe if we listened with open
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minds instead of closed ears to some of what they had to say, we could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learn something.
<br>
<p>(b) What are we and can we do to benefit the movement out of the gravity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;well and into space?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the transhuman technologies, space habitation is the one closest
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to realization.  Why then do we sit and debate nanotech, uploading, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS, and other things that may be tens if not hundreds of years away, when
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the biggest barrier to space exploration and settlement, other than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NASA/ESA/Energiya/etc., is the cost of getting out of the gravity well?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satellite launches are a multi-billion dollar business; there HAS to be 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;someone out there with enough marketing savvy to begin mining venture 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capital - and aren't at least SOME of us genuine rocket scientists?  If
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we can mine the satellite launch process as a source ofincome, we could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suddenly have what ever non-mainstream political and social group wishes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it had - a power base, economically.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a simple matter from an inexpensive launch mechanism to full-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scale private habitation in space, to manufacturing and community 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formation.  Keep the company private - or at least majority-privately
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;held, and construct a business plan that runs in the 50-100 year span.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been constructing a near-future sceince fiction universe on almost
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this premise, and it's incredibly feasable; the more research I do, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more feasable it seems.  Where are the people working for this?
<br>
<p>(c) People who are not economic libertarians have significant greivances; why
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aren't we addressing these?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things such as overseas labor conditions, personal sovereignty, artificial
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scarcity in key needs (such as housing), environmental degredation, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the oft-proven link between agrochemicals and cancer are concerns raised
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again and again by those across the political spectrum.  These are not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;political concerns, but social ones.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are these things dismissed because they're the hard questions, and we want
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to only answer the easy ones?  Or are they simply inconvenient for the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;political and personal philosophies of some of the speakers here?  We
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are intelligent; we should all be capable of rising above cheap rhetorical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devices and knee-jerk dismissals to consider issues at the fundamental 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;level.  I vote Browne in the election, not because I beleive in economic 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;libertarianism, but SOCIAL libertarianism - an increasing number of 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people who were formerly of the Liberal(/)Democrat mold are looking for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an alternative to the Mommy/Daddy state especially in terms of direct.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discreet personal sovereignty, and LIbertarianism has all the right 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things; but it seems it's too busy trying to be a splinter off the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Republican Right, rather than along a different poltical axis entirely.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what about these social issues, the ones that transcend simple 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;political pigeonholing, despite our attempts to do so.  Let's consider
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how to take some of these issues from the statists, and turn this to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our advantage.  No one wants to see people starving in the street - 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how do you manage to feed people or enable them to feed themselves 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without turning to handouts and massive government subsidies?  How do
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you assure a stable food supply with fewer and fewer externally added
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chemicals, while addressing the fears of &quot;outbreaks&quot; and possible
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negative reactions in those whom eat these new foods?  It's all about
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tradeoffs in the real world - if you fear the Greens so much, find 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what their issues are and present solutions to the issues that fit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with your mode of thinking, instead of simply dismissing them as non-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issues.
<br>
<p>But now I've started to rant, which is a signal for this to end.  But in 
<br>
closing, I'm going to steal a series of questions from J. Michael Strazynski
<br>
(sp?):
<br>
<p>Who are we?
<br>
What do we want?
<br>
Why are we here?
<br>
<p>The answers aren't as easy as you might at first thing.
<br>
<p>-Corey
