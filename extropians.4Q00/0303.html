Eugene describes a global uploading scenario:
<br>
<em>&gt; After the exodus is complete but for those recalcitrant curmugeons who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely, positively don't want to and deal with all negotiators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using firearms as arguments, all restrictions are lifted, and off we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go. No one knows what will happen next, but I do definitely do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to be in the shoes of those who are left behind, because through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the decision to stay they've rendered themselves extremely powerless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and vulnerable.
</em><br>
<p>I'm confused about why you want to prevent anyone from enhancing themself
<br>
in a world where most people aren't uploaded, but you would allow and
<br>
encourage (?) it once most people do have the option?
<br>
<p>The scenario I am guessing you see is that one or more uploads goes into
<br>
a self-enhancing positive feedback loop, one of them wins and becomes
<br>
nearly infinitely powerful in a short period of time, and then everyone
<br>
else would be at his mercy.
<br>
<p>But presumably other uploads (and the computers on which they run)
<br>
would be equally at the mercy of the winning Singularitarian upload,
<br>
the one who got to the finish line first.  There would be no safety in
<br>
being an upload.
<br>
<p>Is it just that you think the race is fairer if a lot of people get to
<br>
start at once?  So that even if the winning upload does wipe everyone out,
<br>
it is OK if a lot of people had a shot at being the one?
<br>
<p>Or do you think that the scenario where everyone starts at once is more
<br>
likely to be a safe transition, which protects the ones which don't
<br>
advance quite as quickly as others?
<br>
<p>It would be helpful if you would spell out the scenario here.  Also,
<br>
what if, given the option to upload, most people don't do it (or
<br>
can't afford to)?  That seems like a pretty strong possibility to me.
<br>
Most people today are totally repulsed by the idea of becoming uploads.
<br>
