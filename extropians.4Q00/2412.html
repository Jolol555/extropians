</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A community is not an asset that belongs to you, and if its tyrannical, it must

</em><br>
<p>Community != government.  Membership in a community is an asset that
<br>
belongs to a person, where the value of the asset is rather strongly
<br>
linked to the value of the community - even if there is the perception
<br>
that the community is, to some extent, under siege by a tyrannical
<br>
government controlled by those outside the community.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I personally find that more poor people move around far more frequently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than more affluent people, so your argument does not hold. Welfare people seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to find it quite easy to move from city to city and state to state to follow the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best benefits, according to the data. U-HAUL and KOA are wonderful things. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could move my own household for $500-$1000 from coast to coast with little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trouble. People seem to excel at finding reasons to not do things far more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding reasons to do things.
</em><br>
<p>True.  But that still does not resolve the problem of people living in
<br>
an area for the benefits that it gives, and yet fearful of the
<br>
enforcers of law in that area even though they are not criminals
<br>
(perhaps out of fear that the police see them as the leeches they
<br>
believe themselves to be, if they think that the benefits were &quot;meant&quot;
<br>
to help unfortunates who were in the community before people moved in
<br>
to take advantage of the benefits).
