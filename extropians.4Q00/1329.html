<p>Fastest selection of auto-replicators is not relevant in a space where

selection/desirability criteria and limitations are more complex that
<br>
the scenarios where efficience of replication rules all.  I have no

reason to assume everything is explanable and predictable according to

auto-replication models or by comparing super-intelligent species and

their agents to RNA.

<em>&gt; Huh? Policing agency? Relativistic latency prevents you from synching

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not so.  You do not need to synch action across huge volumes to stop
<br>
encroachment on protected areas.  Local intelligent defenses of
<br>
sufficient caliber will be adequate.  The encroachment is limited by
<br>
even greater constraints than speed of light communication.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; instance, that there is a sort of Vingean relative slowness bubble
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; around us until we seem mature enough to venture out into the broader
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; universe.  The bubble would make operations unprofitable for those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We're talking about real physics, not science fiction physics. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inner areas of galaxies are sterile, it is due to other mechanisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What pray tell is real physics post-Singularity?  It is to laugh to
<br>
dismiss &quot;science fiction physics&quot; out of hand.  What a science fiction
<br>
writer can come up with today is merely a jumping off point for the best
<br>
scientists today.  Post-singularity with vastly increased and
<br>
concentrated intelligence much that is science-fiction will be child's
<br>
play.  The inner areas of galaxies?  If they are sterile of life it is
<br>
probably due to higher radiation, asteroid bombardment and so on.  At
<br>
least sterile of life as we usually define it.  Post-SI entities could
<br>
probably exist and thrive in some remarkably &quot;sterile&quot; environments.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; might be tempted to not respect the local nursery space.  But I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; actually suggest that any forces that may be have a mutual agreement to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; abide by certain rules and do not let new races out and about until they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; make the same agreement and can be trusted to keep it.    I would expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; much more advanced species to have much more advanced ways of sealing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; such a mutual agreement than simple brute force and hauling one another
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; before magistrates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You anthromorphize a lot. Lots of hidden assumptions guarantee a bogus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not in the least.  I simply expect intelligence, esepcially much higher
<br>
intelligence to manage to make and keep agreements that increase its
<br>
overall benefits and avoid too much conflict and chaos.  I would rather
<br>
bet on that than bet that a model based on replicating bacteria is more
<br>
applicable.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; The key technology that would make a difference would be an ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; to project force out farther and faster than reproducing colonists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; could move.  But it is hard to imagine such a technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Well, if the colonies are moving at less than c and there is a means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; communication at c or better and policing mechanisms have been deployed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; throughout the protected spaces (at least), then it is not that terribly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can't protect the space other than being there with sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrastructure to intercept and outgun intruders. Assuming how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrastructure you need, it is hard to miss such presence, and it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not obvious that more advanced (and nonexpansive?!) species can cast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their invisible protective veil faster than the fast dumb brutes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Dunno.  We would miss serious nanotech level defenses in say the Oort
<br>
Cloud today.  Hell, we would miss significant nanotech level presence
<br>
even on earth. What makes you think for a second that the more advanced
<br>
and more moral species will stand for the fast dumb brutes marching
<br>
roughshod over the developing races?  Personally I would tend to protect
<br>
developing races and make sure they don't get too far out into the rest
<br>
of the galaxy while they still are &quot;dumb brutes&quot;.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; difficult.  Forget the communication.  Just have local intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; mechanisms on guard duty that are sufficiently powerful to deter any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; foolish enough to break the agreements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you're that powerful to brush off pioneers, you don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to. Because you're sitting at the center of a rapidly expanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bubble. You're then the enemy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sigh. You seem unable to think beyond your own model of endless conflict
<br>
to see that it is actually in the interest of intelligent species to
<br>
cooperate and that it might be considered in their interest to carefully
<br>
guard the development of young species.  It is not that hard to set up
<br>
agreements between species that have mutual interests and agreements
<br>
about what is important. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If you can expand, you will. If you can't or won't, you're irrelevant,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because no one is ever going to interact with you. Hence either Rare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth, or the Zoo.
</em><br>
<p>Expansion is not the end and be all that you attempt to make it.  There
<br>
are other things of massive importance that make an individual or a
<br>
species worth interacting with.  Expansion does not equate to mindless
<br>
expansion that destroys and consumes everything else other than itself
<br>
regardless.  In all the vastness of space other life might be rare
<br>
enough to be held quite special and worthy of respect and room to
<br>
develop.
