<p><em>&gt;Well, one use of the Internet is for publishing web pages, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is akin to broadcasting.  Presumably your ban would need to apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to web publishers in addition to TV, right?
</em><br>
<p>Yes
<br>
<p><em>&gt;An interesting example in the recent election was Matt Drudge,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whose site drudgereport.com published the early exit poll results,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contravening the stated policy of the consortium which conducted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the polls, Voter News Service.  He may still get sued for this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we'll see. Would you muzzle Matt Drudge?  Is he merely an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;influential individual, or does he count as a broadcaster?  How to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decide?  What happens as others become successful publishing their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own opinions?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not muzzling anyone, I'm talking about delaying talking about
<br>
an on going process till it's completed. As I've already pointed
<br>
out we have reasonable time delays on the Second Amendment already,
<br>
why not the first?
<br>
<p>At some point individuals become &quot;common carriers&quot; and subject to
<br>
regulation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't see how you can draw a meaningful line between individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the media, given that there are a number of influential
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuals (and you can bet that more such personal sites would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spring up if you did succeed in quashing media discussion).  Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there are discussion groups like alt.politics (which is actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where I found Drudge's reports, his site was overloaded all day),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chat rooms and a host of other communication options.
</em><br>
<p>Make a law, punish people who break the law, simple.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Face it, the future is moving towards increased information flow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Any proposal to limit political discussion is a non-starter, IMO.
</em><br>
<p>I do this for a living (I'm reading Gilders Telecosm now), and as
<br>
I've already said, I'm not out to limit any discussion, just impose
<br>
a delay for the duration of the polling.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I don't think the burden of proof ought to be on someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;justifying a positive use for people being able to communicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with each other. Rather, you need to show that there is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significant harm in allowing them to do so, in order to justify
</em><br>
<em>&gt;muzzling their natural ability to communicate.
</em><br>
<p>I went to bed when I heard that Gore had won Florida, people
<br>
standing in line in California went home thinking they were wasting
<br>
there time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why should we restrict people from learning how others are voting?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What is the harm?
</em><br>
<p>It could change the result, that is obvious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If it really were so harmful, shouldn't we disallow pre-election
</em><br>
<em>&gt;polling? That gives people an idea about how others should vote. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Granted it is not as accurate, but as we have seen, same-day
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reports are not always 100% accurate either (Drudge had Florida
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going overwhelmingly for Gore, which is why the networks called it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;15 minutes after most but not all of the polls closed).
</em><br>
<p>There has already been testimony from people who heard this and
<br>
decided there was no reason to vote.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Even if such information influences votes, don't people have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right to use whatever information they choose in making decisions? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What gives us the omniscience to say that the world would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better place if each person were to decide without any information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about what others are doing?
</em><br>
<p>As I've said before, I'm not out to limit the discussion, just
<br>
impose a timedelay during the polling, nothing more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is plenty of experimental and theoretical reason to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that giving people the maximum of information will help them. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Take the famous Delphi system, in which experts are polled, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then given feedback about what other experts said in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;revise their estimates.  The feedback is said to greatly improve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accuracy.  Or look at the theoretical results in which social
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information institutions evolve to be trustworthy so that average
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuals don't have to be experts on everything in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still make decent decisions.  People implicitly rely on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;judgement of their fellows being roughly accurate most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time.
</em><br>
<p>People follow trends, if everyone thinks everyone else is voting
<br>
for someone they will too. Everyone likes to be on the winning
<br>
side.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It seems to me to be contrary to the principle of respect for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individual autonomy to try to put a ban like this into place. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Better to let people decide for themselves what information they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want to use.
</em><br>
<p>It's not a ban, just a delay, you can talk about anything you like
<br>
up to the moment the polls open, you can talk about anything you
<br>
like during, EXCEPT what is going on at the polls.
<br>
<p>As I've already pointed out the media is biased, they were clearly
<br>
out to elect a specific candidate.
