<em>&gt;I personally think those who demand the perpetuation of personal &quot;privacy&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in a future that will live and breath on the unrestricted communication and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;processing of ever increasing amounts of informatio are unknowing Luddites.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;unrestricted&quot;?  You think there will no longer be a need for privacy?
<br>
<p>So, in your future, you think that there will no longer be criminals 
<br>
ready to take your money from your bank accounts; no longer be people 
<br>
willing to take advantage of information you have, like ideas for 
<br>
inventions; no longer be anyone who is judgmental about your 
<br>
lifestyle?
<br>
<p>You think that human nature will be perfect in every way, 
<br>
transcending all of these problems and many others?  Just how far off 
<br>
is that future: ten years,  a hundred years, a thousand years?
<br>
<p>Do you at least acknowledge that privacy is necessary in the face of 
<br>
those problems (and a whole host of others) today?  Do you really 
<br>
think that people who would at least like for personal privacy to 
<br>
exist while those above problems exist are &quot;unknowing Luddites&quot;?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;As I see it our ultimate &quot;purpose,&quot; if there is one, is to facillitate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;efficient storage, transmission and processing of data.
</em><br>
<p>Bleah, who says we have a purpose?  You'll have to prove (or at least 
<br>
refer to a common one) some metaphysical basis for existence before 
<br>
talking about purpose.  Then we can make stuff up all day about good 
<br>
purposes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Everything at its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;core is information and the more of it we can grasp and utilize, the better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;off we will be.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, but you'll first have to address and remedy the human 
<br>
deficiencies that necessitate personal privacy before referring to 
<br>
privacy adherents as Luddites.  Doing otherwise seems a trifle unfair 
<br>
and premature.
<br>
<p>Even after that, I'm unsure that you can claim that rendering all 
<br>
information public is a Good Thing(tm).  If you and I are playing 
<br>
chess, should you be entitled to know my next move?  If I don't 
<br>
personally like the color of your space suit, should you have access 
<br>
to that opinion?  Should you know for whom I voted?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The *only* difference between man and God is access to, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the ability to usefully exploit, information.
</em><br>
<p>The main difference between man and God is that man exists in a 
<br>
scientifically verifiable sense.  If you're talking about the common 
<br>
perception of what a Judeo-Christian God would be like, you're going 
<br>
to have to acknowledge that there is a substantive difference between 
<br>
omnipotence and omniscience, which are both attributed to him/her/it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;So, on the one hand you say you are an Extropian hoping one day to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Uberman.  On the other hand you want to put up impenetrable road blocks on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the information super-highway.
</em><br>
<p>That's a false dilemma.  The two goals aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   Look in the mirror.  What do you call
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yourself?
</em><br>
<p>Realistic?  Hunky?  Susan? :)
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
