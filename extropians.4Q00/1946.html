<em>&gt; &gt; And what 'commercial meat' are you talking about? Typically cornfed beef
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is the main culprit in any meat diet, but free range beef is as healthy as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beans, fish, or chicken. The danger of the modern meat diet comes from the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with little exercise.
</em><br>
<p>A few problems and a bit of my own dietary experiences.  First, nowhere
<br>
near enough beef to meet demand could be produced by free range
<br>
methods.  Second, the current factory methods for producing animals
<br>
(including chickens, turkeys, pigs and so on) are notorious for multiple
<br>
health vector risks.  Particular the use of massive amounts of various
<br>
steroids, antibiotics, various sicknesses in the animals induced by
<br>
severe overcrowding along with pesticides in the feedstocks.  For that
<br>
matter some of the feedstocks include animal products from previous
<br>
generations.  This can multiple and concentrate the problems.  
<br>
<p>When I first started cutting back on meat products I kept fish and dairy
<br>
for a while.  I cut out eating land animals first.  But then it occurred
<br>
to me that fish, by virtue of filtering water continuously, may
<br>
concentrate any pollutants and nasties in the water thousands of times
<br>
in their flesh.  So I dropped them.  That hurt.  Dairy is very
<br>
problematic in factory methods because the cows are literally kept
<br>
pregnant to get maximum milk production and are boosted into even higher
<br>
estrogen states.  And their feed has all the problems above.  Factory
<br>
milk cows typically live only 1/4 as long as free range cows.  It is not
<br>
a healthy environment.  So dairy went also.
<br>
<p>By then I was totally vegan.  Stayed with it for nearly three years.  It
<br>
was a little difficult finding/producing foods I could eat but not too
<br>
bad as I've always seen food pragmatically.  But after a while I noticed
<br>
that I was a bit too spacey and not so focused.  Could have been the
<br>
diet, could have been large amounts of meditation I was doing around the
<br>
same time.  Lately I've seen articles on the dangers of many
<br>
underprocessed soy products, especially to memory/concentration.  I was
<br>
eating a lot of soy so that may have been the culprit.  I know that now
<br>
that I avoid tofu my memory is sharper than it was a few years ago when
<br>
I ate a lot of it.  In the end I departed the vegan ranks.  At first I
<br>
only added seafood and a little dairy.  Since then  I've tried other
<br>
things.  I still don't have much taste for heavier meats but I now eat
<br>
chicken, fish and most dairy.  The chicken feels a bit wierd
<br>
physically.  The fish seems mainly ok. The dairy results im more mucous
<br>
production.
