Some unmarshalled thoughts on the subject:
<br>
<p>I think the success of the (Pilot|Palm|Visor) and cellphone is
<br>
instructive.
<br>
<p>PDAs of choice have useful battery lives measured in (several) weeks.
<br>
Cellphones? Days, at least. In both cases, the things they talk to have
<br>
&quot;don't worry about it&quot; power requirements.
<br>
And 2000 is like 1900 in that now is the equivalent of the day of the
<br>
handcranked automobile with regard to ubiquitous computing. Once you try
<br>
to drive out of town, you find out you'd better know a farmer with a
<br>
mule. 
<br>
<p>Contrariwise, when (someday) my cufflinks/cuff buttons are doing voice
<br>
recognition for me and passing it along via Bluetooth (or whatever), I'd
<br>
better know that laundering my shirt (or whatever) imparts enough energy
<br>
to make them go. Ubiquity should imply low perceived effort.
<br>
<p>The Athlon, much as I like AMD, is/was kind of a step headed in the
<br>
wrong direction.
<br>
<p>How ubiquitous are insects and arachnids? What are their salient
<br>
characteristics?
<br>
<p>Simple functions. Rugged architecture. Low, &quot;bursty&quot; power requirements:
<br>
think &quot;spider&quot;. Mature, reliable code. And of course, self-reproducing
<br>
(uh oh) as part of an ecology.
<br>
<p>Scratch the first half of the last one for all the appropriate &quot;gray
<br>
goo&quot; reasons, and we're left with one more comparison between PDAs and
<br>
phones: bandwidth has its price as surely as a classic muscle car gulps
<br>
gas. How much do you really need? Think Prius (hybrid car).
<br>
<p>The CPU/System clock speed arms race can't be the only game in town.
<br>
Consumers are noticing this. What the hell do I need a 1 GHz CPU clock
<br>
for when I'm still connecting with a 56K modem? Even if I had T1, how
<br>
much would such a CPU help?
