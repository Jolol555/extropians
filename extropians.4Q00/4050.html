<em>&gt;Gene Mutation Doubles Life Span
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) - Mutation of a gene whimsically named ``I'm not dead 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yet'' can double the life span of fruit flies, a laboratory discovery that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;researchers said may lead to drugs to help people live longer and, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perhaps, even lose weight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Researchers at the University of Connecticut Health Center have found that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the life span of fruit flies was extended from an average of 37 days to 70 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;days when a gene was modified on a single chromosome. Some flies in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;study lived 110 days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The same long-life gene exists in humans, said Dr. Stephen L. Helfand, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;senior author of the study, and ``offers a target for future drug 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;therapies aimed at extending life.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In human terms, a doubled life span would be about 150 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Helfand said the gene mutation appears to work by restricting calorie 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;absorption on a cellular level - in effect, putting the cells on a diet. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This raises the possibility, he said, of one day developing a pill that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would both extend life and control weight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;``From what we know about this gene, that makes perfect sense,'' he said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Helfand said a key finding of the study, which was appearing Friday in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;journal Science, is that not only did the fruit flies live longer, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they also seemed to maintain a high quality of life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;``It is not an empty or hollow increase in life span. It prolongs active 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adult life, and I think, delays the onset of aging,'' he said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Some life-extension studies showed that animals tended to trade vigor and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;energy for a longer life, he said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But the mutant flies ``do well throughout their longer life,'' Helfand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;said. ``By the time that 80 to 90 percent of normal flies are dead, these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mutants are still doing just fine.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Blanka Rogina, a co-author of the study, said female flies with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mutated genes were able to reproduce throughout life. They had the energy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for the fruit flies complex courtship ritual and could lay up to 2,000 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eggs in their lifetime, compared with about 1,300 eggs normally, she said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The long-life gene was named for a comical line - ``I'm not dead yet'' - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from a Monty Python movie, Helfand said. The gene's name was suggested by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;co-author Robert A. Reenan and has been shortened to ``Indy.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;``In academic circles,'' explained Helfand, ``sophomoric humor, such as in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Monty Python, is very common.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There have been other studies that found long-life genes in fruit flies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and nematodes. There also have been experiments in mice that show calorie 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;restriction - a severe diet - can extend life by up to 50 percent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But Huber Warner, associate director for research into the biology of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aging at the National Institute of Aging, said the Indy gene discovery is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more significant because ``it may be a different way to get the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effect that caloric restriction achieved in mice and other organisms.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He said it may be possible to develop a drug that inhibits metabolism in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the same way as the mutated Indy gene. Such a drug would have to be tested 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extensively in animals to assure that it is safe, Warner said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;``If you wanted to slow metabolism in people, this research suggests that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this could be a way to do it,'' he said. ``It is strictly theoretical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right now, but it is a possibility.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Helfand and his colleagues discovered the livelong gene by chance. He said 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they were screening a strain of fruit flies in another study and found 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that flies were living much longer than normal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They isolated the Indy gene and then tested it in a number of different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laboratory fruit fly strains. In all cases, it extended life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But Helfand said the researchers discovered that if the gene is mutated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;too much, it actually shortens life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The normal gene is on two chromosomes of the fruit fly. If one of these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genes is altered, thus reducing the strength of the gene, then the flies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enjoyed a long life. If both genes were knocked out altogether, said 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Helfand, the flies actually died sooner, perhaps starving to death.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;``If we restrict (the gene) a little bit there is a big advantage,'' said 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Helfand. ``But if we make an animal that has only the mutated gene, we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find that the animal lives a shorter than normal.''
