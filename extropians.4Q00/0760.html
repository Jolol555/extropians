<em>&gt;From: Alex Future Bokov &lt;<a href="mailto:alexboko@umich.edu?Subject=Re:%20Cryo-suspension%20for%20death%20row&In-Reply-To=&lt;200010101411.HAA13220@well.com&gt;">alexboko@umich.edu</a>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I do not believe in life after death. I therefore believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;when someone dies and the structure of the brain decays, they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;lost.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I agree, but that is a separate axiom from...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It follows axiomatically that I believe the killer suffer an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;equal fate.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;....this. The no life after death axiom I understand, because it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meshes with my own Ockham's Razor axiom. The &quot;eye for an eye&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;axiom I don't understand. But then again, I guess that's why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they're axioms. They don't need a rational basis; one has to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*some* arbitrary point of reference (cf. Existentialism Plus).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the &quot;eye for an eye&quot; axiom is defined by many religions, it is
<br>
an aphorism that has endured.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It would be interesting to speculate on the evolutionary origins
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of this 'justice' meme, and how widespread it is. Do we agree,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though, that it exists at a level that doesn't run quite as deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as the 'survival', 'expansion', and 'opimization' memes?
</em><br>
<p>I would tend to agree
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This is a third axiom-- that if the 'homicidal' and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'non-homicidal' portions of a perpetrator's brain can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;separated, then 'homicidal' portion also *must* be the one that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;houses the sense of self, the identity. Unlike the other two
</em><br>
<em>&gt;axioms-- no life after death, and eye for an eye, this axiom just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might be overturned by future discoveries in neuropsychology.
</em><br>
<p>This is not exactly what I meant, I am out to destroy the
<br>
personnality that caused the homicide, not that the homicidal part
<br>
is the self.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When an axiom contradicts scientific findings, there emerges a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conflict between it and the scientific method axiom. So, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evidence starts to accumulate that any human brain can be nudged
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into a state conducive to cold-blooded murder, or conversely if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is demonstrated that removing a particular tangle of neurons will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make a person incapable of killing, that will open quite a can of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worms, won't it?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Please don't be offended by my cross examination, btw. I'm partly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;playing devil's advocate to learn more about your point of view.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all......
<br>
<p>I endeared myself to a philosophy prof in college by always willing
<br>
adopting the devils advocate personna in order to foster
<br>
discussion. I had friends who took his class years later and said
<br>
he often spoke of a former student who used to ignite the most
<br>
interesting discussions. My friend approached him after class and
<br>
was able to confirm it was indeed me he spoke of.
<br>
<p>Most of the positions (opinions) I hold now are the opposite of
<br>
what I formerly believed. The result of just such discussions.
