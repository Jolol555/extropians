</em><br>
<em>&gt; me that question in the last several months (the other two being Eric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Drexler and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert Bradbury).
</em><br>
<p>WOW cooool, Drexler, Bradbury, spike.  There are three names I
<br>
like to see mentioned in the same sentence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You all have the same goal in mind, I know. Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach makes perfect sense to me ...  but ..
</em><br>
<p>Today I was doing some back of the envelope calcs and I think
<br>
I know why the other two wanted to know.  If interstellar matter
<br>
is as dense as 200 nanograms per cubic kilometer, then crossing any
<br>
interstellar distance in one human lifetime will be extremely difficult
<br>
if not impossible.
<br>
<p>Heres how I figure: an astronaut is usually at least 30 and human
<br>
life expectancy is about 75, so 45 years to cover... lets see, the
<br>
nearest star is about 4 light years and some change I think, so
<br>
about 0.1c to get there in a lifetime, neglecting acceleration and
<br>
deceleration phases.
<br>
<p>Assuming away the inherent difficulties in actually pushing a
<br>
vehicle to that speed, the erosion as a function of interstellar
<br>
matter becomes a hell of a problem.  I did a calc today assuming
<br>
an iceberg shield up front, as in Clarke's Songs of Distant Earth.
<br>
<p>Assuming that we start with the iceberg at about 10 Kelvin
<br>
and that the energy of collision with interstellarlopers provides the
<br>
heat of fusion and vaporization to the water molecules, then
<br>
also provides the heat of dissociation for the hydrogen
<br>
molecules and the oxygen, plus complete ionization to plasma;
<br>
even assuming all that energy is taken from the transfer of
<br>
kinetic energy from the interstellar matter, if the overall density
<br>
is as high as 200 nanograms per cubic kilometer, we will still
<br>
need an iceberg shield many kilometers thick, maaaaany
<br>
kilometers, to erode away during the trip.
<br>
<p>Before I post my calculations, I want to let others try the calcs
<br>
independently, and I do hope I did something extremely wrong.
<br>
Some of the oddities: I found that the thickness of the shield
<br>
required is directly proportional to the velocity and directly
<br>
proportional to the density of interstellar matter.  Secondly and
<br>
even more disturbing, I calculated that the actual makeup of
<br>
the interstellar matter makes no difference: stray helium and
<br>
hydrogen are just as erosive as an equal mass of dust particles,
<br>
and I fear there is a lot more of that stuff than the
<br>
interstellarlopers.  I do hope the overall density of stuff
<br>
between stars is way less than my estimated upper bound
<br>
of 200 nanograms per cubic kilometer.
<br>
<p>The erosion rate I got for .1c was on the order of a cm a day,
<br>
using some admittedly rough estimates.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, this whole exercise may explain some things,
<br>
specifically why humans have a history of low technology.
<br>
Ever wonder why we can pick up a history book and
<br>
read that a few centuries ago we didnt have machines?
<br>
Funny question?
<br>
<p>Assume away all interstellar matter.  Then intelligent life
<br>
would have evolved somewhere and built spaceships and
<br>
crossed the gulfs between stars and seeded itself everywhere
<br>
in the galaxy, either by going really fast or travelling really
<br>
long.  Within a few short eons, the first intelligent
<br>
species would arrive on various planets, teraform
<br>
and start out with a culture of technology.  Right?
<br>
<p>Evidently humans did not start that way.  We have a history
<br>
of low technology.  Why?  The dust calc would offer an
<br>
explanation: that interstellar space is *inherently* difficult
<br>
to cross.  If there is no unknown technology {such as
<br>
opening a temporary wormhole}, then we are left with
<br>
two technologically daunting paths for crossing interstellar
<br>
space: either 1)  multigeneration ships far from any energy
<br>
source, or 2)  very high speeds, in which interstellar dust
<br>
and gas would grind our ship to powder.  So then crossing
<br>
the starry gulf is *inherently difficult* even for the very
<br>
most advanced races, and consequently no one has done
<br>
it ever, and so humans have had time to evolve technology
<br>
the old fashioned way.
<br>
<p>Amara thanks for the references, you are too kind.  spike
