<p>Good to hear.  I hope you also take care to minimize your risks for breast
<br>
cancer in other ways.
<br>
<p>Sadly, a friend of mine's mother has breast cancer.  She's had it now for
<br>
about two years.  They've used a variety of therapies.  It keeps going into
<br>
remission and coming back.  However, she has done almost zilch to change her
<br>
lifestyle.  She's overweight and eats a typical American diet -- lots of red
<br>
meat and carbs.  She doesn't even take any supplements.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd rather have a little pain for a few seconds than the IV sedation
</em><br>

<br>

</em><br>
<p>Of course, you must remember, your case is probably not the way most people
<br>
experience such biopsies.  In a lot of them, I'm sure, sedation is required.
<br>
Also, the level of pain one can tolerate varies from individual to
<br>
individual.  That's why there are people who will pull a tooth with no
<br>
anesthesia and others who want to be out for the process.  (Another case in
<br>
point:  I work with a bunch of &quot;Advil addicts&quot; -- people who constantly
<br>
medicate for the smallest ache or pain.:)
<br>
<p>I agree, however, with you.  If you can avoid anesthesia, then it's all the
<br>
better.  After all, in many cases, the less anesthetic intervention, the
<br>
faster you can get out of the hospital or doctor's office and back to life.
<br>
(Not that this has cropped up much in my life -- except at the dentist.:)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
