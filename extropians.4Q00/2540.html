</em><br>
<p>Being, as I am, a philosophy student from a similar background to
<br>
yourself, I might suggest that relativism makes no sense to anyone.
<br>
So, an honest relativist can't help but notice that relativism is
<br>
false for some people.  But can it be true for YOU?  If relativism can
<br>
be false for some people, but true for others, I'm not sure what the
<br>
position amounts to, since that's not relativism any more.
<br>
<p>(This problem extends from the fact that relativism has too much to
<br>
say about the truth of all belief everywhere.  It's an attempt to
<br>
reach an objective view about beliefs where, it must be admitted, no
<br>
objective view is possible.)
<br>
<p>Anyway, I might reccomend instead an open-minded ethnocentrism.
<br>
(Where your group or ethnicity may include only you [though I rather,
<br>
rather doubt it.])  Sure, everyone has their own internally consistent
<br>
justifications for their own beliefs, but that doesn't make THEM right
<br>
about anything.  I believe what I believe, but I'll take you seriously
<br>
if you have something to tell me.
<br>
<p>Alternately, take Wittgenstein seriously with his private language
<br>
argument.
<br>
<p>When I say language, assume that this includes at least some minimal
<br>
apparatus for determining the truth and falsehood of statements.  So,
<br>
if we fully disagree about how to determine the truth and falsehood of
<br>
statements, we're not speaking the same language.  To see this,
<br>
suppose I told you: &quot;I know what apples are.  They are large four
<br>
legged solid-hoofed mammals that are good for riding.&quot;  You might say
<br>
that I'm wrong about apples, but it would make just as much sense to
<br>
say that I'm speaking a different language in which &quot;apple&quot; means
<br>
&quot;horse.&quot;  All of this turns on whether it is true in my language that
<br>
apples have the character I described above, that is, whether my claim
<br>
can be true by definition.  (Ever wonder why they call it &quot;logic,&quot;
<br>
after the greek term for &quot;word&quot;?  It's because modern logic was
<br>
designed by philosophers of language to analyze our language's truth
<br>
conditions.  Logic is a study of language truths.)
<br>
<p>But, if relativism is true, then there's no possibility for us to have
<br>
the same conditions for evaluating truth/falsehood, because we can't
<br>
share truth/falsehood.  I'm evaluating truth-for-me, and you're
<br>
evaluating truth-for-you.  (&quot;But those could be the same!&quot;  No, they
<br>
can only be same-for-me, or same-for-you.)  That implies that
<br>
everything I say is true-for-me in my language (i.e. by definition),
<br>
and everything you say is true-for-you in your language.
<br>
<p>But when we make a statement that's true by definition, we're not
<br>
making a claim about the world, we're just making a claim about what
<br>
our words mean.  But if we NEVER make a claim about a world, if we're
<br>
ALWAYS talking in definitions, then none of our words can ever
<br>
actually have a referent.  So we're never talking about anything in
<br>
particular.  So relativism REALLY makes no sense.
<br>
<p>[Many will criticize my picture of reference, (I only picked it
<br>
because it's a natural one that requires little explication,) but I
<br>
can recriticize relativism from just about any theory of reference via
<br>
a similar argument.  For example, suppose words have no reference, but
<br>
only a use.  Nonetheless, if there's no such thing as right uses and
<br>
wrong uses, then words have no *particular* use, and, thus, no
<br>
meaning.]
<br>
<p>All this can be avoided if we just fall back on ethnocentrism.  And,
<br>
again, so long as we're open-minded in our ethnocentrism, that's OK.
