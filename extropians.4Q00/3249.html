<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So, on the one hand you say you are an Extropian hoping one day to
</em><br>
become
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Uberman.  On the other hand you want to put up impenetrable road blocks
</em><br>
on
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the information super-highway.  Look in the mirror.  What do you call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; yourself?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Someone who prefers powerful information to free information.
</em><br>
<p>Implying somehow that free information is less powerful than hidden info?
<br>
If so, how?  Why?  Examples please.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Someone who prefers personal empowerment to the empowerment of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collective.
</em><br>
<p>What is a &quot;collective&quot; other than a set of &quot;personal&quot; entities?  If persons
<br>
as individuals are empowered, doesn't that also simultaneously empower the
<br>
collection of those persons?  Or are you saying that empowerment is OK for
<br>
you, so long as it isn't available to your peers?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Someone who believes that roadblocks breed innovation.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  The logical result being that innovation breaches the roadblocks,
<br>
and the roadblocks turn out to be a net waste of time.  You know, &quot;the net
<br>
interprets censorship as damage and routes around it&quot; thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Someone who believes that maximum power is not found in totally free
</em><br>
access
<br>
<em>&gt; to information, since that is a disempowerment of our ability to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information secure.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds nice.  But isn't that similar to saying that strength is not strong
<br>
because it disempowers our ability to be weak?  Or wealth disempowers our
<br>
ability to be poor?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instead, rather, (as in most things) there is a point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of maximum resonance found on the line of tension between the extremes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is where the most interesting things happen.  (i.e. Chaos &lt;--&gt; Order
</em><br>
::
<br>
<em>&gt; Complexity)
</em><br>
<p>Not sure I follow.  But I think you're saying that if we had all the answers
<br>
(i.e. unfettered access to all information) life would be a boring bummer.
<br>
Perhaps.  But I think we've got a l-o-o-o-o-n-g way to go before we have to
<br>
deal with that problem.  The universe has hidden her secrets quite well and
<br>
we are only beginning now to hammer out the tools that will help us build
<br>
the tools that will help us ferret out those secrets.
