</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Responses such as &quot;I'd liquidate all my assets and go on a cruise&quot; or

<p>It depends.  I do have some obligations to dependents that I would spend
<br>
a part of the energy and time left attempting to resolve.  But for the
<br>
most part I would stop doing everything BUT putting into words, code,
<br>
images and communicating to others every thought and idea and viewpoint
<br>
that I believe is most important and that I want to see continue and
<br>
grow in the world.  These things range across a gamut of technological,
<br>
philosophical, sociological, pieces of unifying visions and so on.  In
<br>
other words I would use all the time remaining for the actual Work
<br>
rather than for making a down payment on life.  
<br>
<p>Self-centered viewpoints are very interesting things.  A lot depends on
<br>
the size of one's definition of &quot;self&quot;.  The continuation and ultimate
<br>
success of what I believe is most important is &quot;self-centered&quot;
<br>
regardless of whether this body/personality/mind unity personally
<br>
survives or not.  I would definitely prefer it did but myself includes
<br>
that personal self rather than being limited to it.
