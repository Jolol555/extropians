<em>&gt; A MUSICAL ODYSSEY
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Issue Ten:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A long strange trip through the music collection of Dirk Douglas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ayn Rand claimed that our philosophical premises,conscious and
</em><br>
subconscious,
<br>
<em>&gt; give rise to our aesthetic preferences.  If anecdotal accounts are to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trusted, she went so far as to judge others on little more than artistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence:  So-and-so likes Beethoven-therefore he has a malevolent sense
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; life - therefore he is not my kind of person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I share Rand's moderate, &quot;official&quot; position, but not the extreme version
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she appears to have held in private. Against Rand's private view one thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can be said is that Rand seems not to have considered the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that multiple premises might lead to the same taste, or that the same one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premise might be expressed in multiple tastes.  Instead of regarding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artistic taste as an unequivocal symptom of an unambiguous spiritual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condition, I regard it as more of a magnifying glass; it delivers no
</em><br>
occult
<br>
<em>&gt; knowledge, but it can help you see something you are already familiar with
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; lot better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An opportunity recently arose for me to put the Randian theory to the
</em><br>
test.
<br>
<em>&gt; A few months ago I was given the entire CD collection of a man named Dirk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Douglas, a musician of my acquaintance who died unexpectedly in June  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think he'd mind if I spoke frankly, even bluntly, about the lessons
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; have learned from studying his collection:  I knew Dirk for many years,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; candor was one of his highest values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dirk had surprisingly narrow affinities. At least 75% of his collection,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which numbered 72 discs, came from the 1970s or from bands whose heyday
</em><br>
was
<br>
<em>&gt; in the 70s.  He had five or six albums each by Kansas and Yes as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatest hits albums by Foreigner, Starship and the like.  He also had a
</em><br>
few
<br>
<em>&gt; greatest hits discs from early 80s performers like Mr Mister and Kenny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Loggins who were essentially holdovers from the 70s.  He had almost no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classic 60s rock - an album of Blood, Sweat and Tears from his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brass-band days was about it.  He did have a few more recent discs:  one
</em><br>
by
<br>
<em>&gt; Tori Amos, one by Joan Osborne.  He also had several upbeat white gospel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; albums of recent vintage, presumably acquired during the last few years of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his life when his health was poor and he once again turned to
</em><br>
Christianity.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There were a few classical and jazz items.  Dirk's mother, I know, was a
</em><br>
big
<br>
<em>&gt; fan of Chopin and encouraged Dirk's piano playing.  (Dirk was a keyboard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; player, singer and arranger.)  So there was a disc of Chopin performed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vladimir Horowitz, a soundtrack from the movie &quot;Shine&quot; and one or two
</em><br>
cheesy
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Great Classical Piano Works&quot; compilations.  The principle behind his jazz
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collection I cannot discern, but he did have the good taste to like
</em><br>
classic
<br>
<em>&gt; jazz like Miles Davis' &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; and not modern anti-jazz like Kenny
</em><br>
G.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is obvious that Dirk favored keyboards, but he also favored vocal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harmonies.  He had a couple of CDs he'd burned himself featuring songs
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; tight harmonies, including one song by the Carpenters, a group he would
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; little to do with otherwise.  He had greatest hits albums by Queen and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth, Wind and Fire (among the rare black performers in Dirk's
</em><br>
catalogue).
<br>
<em>&gt; Dirk himself had a good, versatile voice, and was not only very proud of
</em><br>
his
<br>
<em>&gt; harmonizing but was also a connoisseur of other people's.  I remember him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost 25 years ago explaining to me how the Wilson brothers of the Beach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Boys and Freddie Mercury of Queen worked their miracles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It should be clear that Dirk's musical taste followed his professional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests with regard to the technical dimension. I suspect this is a
</em><br>
common
<br>
<em>&gt; correlation among musicians. But there are plenty of musical acts that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employ keyboards and/or tight vocals.  Why did Dirk pick the ones he did?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dirk started trying to make it as a pro when he was 17,in 1972.  He only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attended a community college and that only for a year or two.  Despite his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impressive intelligence, his formal education in music and everything else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ended in the middle 70s.  The 70s was Dirk's era:  he liked the
</em><br>
questioning
<br>
<em>&gt; of authority, the sexual freedom, the flamboyance of attire and hairstyle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the drugs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is my belief that Dirk was so at home in this era that he simply
</em><br>
stopped
<br>
<em>&gt; growing when it ended.  It's common for a person's tastes (and beliefs)
</em><br>
stop
<br>
<em>&gt; developing once they surpass college age, especially if drugs are a part
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; their life.  Dirk ceased being of college age around 1977.  To be sure, he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did still follow trends after 1977, but not ones that *started* after
</em><br>
1977.
<br>
<em>&gt; And this means that he missed out on punk and new wave.  Whatever you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say about punk, it did clean out the system of its self-indulgent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excesses and made it possible for something ironic and worldly-wise to
</em><br>
grow.
<br>
<em>&gt; But there was nothing like the Clash, Elvis Costello or even Squeeze in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dirk's collection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And Dirk's limited taste was reflected in the music he wrote and performed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too.  The boy was simply lost in the 70s and that fact along with his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personality and health problems no doubt accounts for his failure to make
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; as a musician.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But even this biographical analysis does not peg Dirk and his tastes.  If
</em><br>
he
<br>
<em>&gt; was so in love with the 70s why didn't he own any Eagles or ELO?  Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the technical criteria would knock out some of the great bands of the era,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not all.  Here we need to appeal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Dirk's sense of life and psycho-epistemology.  Let me try to weave an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; image of Dirk with the music he owned as the warp and my personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recollections as the woof.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The groups most represented in his collection were Yes and Kansas.  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have in common, other than the obvious, is that both use keyboards as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their foundation, both are &quot;hyper&quot; or strident in their pacing and
</em><br>
emotional
<br>
<em>&gt; tone, both have pretensions to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;lyrical.&quot;  The main point of difference is that Yes is more impersonal
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; arty where Kansas is more intimate and &quot;sincere.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interestingly, if I had to pick a band that represented a synthesis of Yes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Kansas, I would choose Rush. Yet Dirk didn't own any Rush and never
</em><br>
said
<br>
<em>&gt; a word to me about them.  Dirk was no Objectivist, and his libertarianism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we may loosely call it that, was purely of the &quot;Defy authority - do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drugs&quot; variety.  More importantly, Rush stylistically as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophically dedicated itself to reason:  they were always crystal
</em><br>
clear
<br>
<em>&gt; and they never encouraged self-indulgence of an emotionalistic kind.   In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this way, they were light-years away from Yes and Kansas.  (And no, I do
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; like Rush.  But we can talk about that another time.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From knowing him, I would say that the decisive element shared by most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bands in Dirk's collection was &quot;sincerity.&quot; Dirk hit his teens in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; late 60s and while he was not a &quot;60s person,&quot; he was one of that era's
</em><br>
many
<br>
<em>&gt; heirs.  Those of you old enough to remember the 70s or who have studied it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have surely gleaned that one of its key concepts was &quot;the natural.&quot; Partly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this was due to the ecology movement, and partly it was due to the 1960s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rejection of process in favor of immediate, &quot;authentic&quot; action, experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and emotion.  Put these two influences together and you get a worship of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human nature conceived of as bodily functions and spontaneous feelings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to this &quot;code of the natural,&quot; either you acknowledged those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functions and feelings or you  futilely tried to deny them.  Dirk's
</em><br>
attitude
<br>
<em>&gt; towards what was &quot;natural&quot; ranged from the matter-of-fact to outright
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wallowing. In short, if Dirk had an itch he would scratch it -sometimes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lest I sound one-sidedly critical of Dirk's &quot;naturalism,&quot; let me say that
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; made him a frank and open person, bolstered his sense of humor (because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helped him puncture people's pretensions) and contributed to his largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthy pro-sex attitudes.  That having been said, I hope it's obvious
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; I do not take Dirk's beliefs at face value - and that I do not blame him
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; the errors of an entire generation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The attitude of &quot;sincerity&quot; and &quot;naturalness&quot; are clearly reflected in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dirk's music.  As I write, I am listening to his copy of  &quot;Starship:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Greatest Hits (Ten Years and Change 1979-1991).&quot;  For those of you who
</em><br>
don't
<br>
<em>&gt; know, Starship was the successor group to Jefferson Starship, which was in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn the successor to Jefferson Airplane.  Each successor represents a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diminution of its predecessor.  The original Airplane was a band of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undisciplined geniuses fronted by two amazing vocalists, Grace Slick and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Marty Balin.  Starship was fronted by a third-generation clone of Marty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Balin, an histrionic little man named Mickey Thomas, with Grace Slick as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little more than a back-up vocalist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If Starship has one salient quality, it's a loudly-proclaimed earnestness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With his trademark wail, Thomas squeezes every ounce of feeling out of
</em><br>
songs
<br>
<em>&gt; like &quot;Jane,&quot; &quot;Sara&quot; and &quot;Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now,&quot; the last of which,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improbably, seems to be intended as a wedding anthem for the trailer set.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now I could see a completist fan of the Airplane in all its incarnations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buying such a disc, but Dirk didn't own anything by Jefferson Airplane or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jefferson Starship. He headed straight for the trough of emotion that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just plain Starship.  This album is a particularly clear magnifying glass
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; Dirk's values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With the concept of &quot;sincerity&quot; we have a pretty good hold on Dirk's ethos
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (sense of life or metaphysical value judgments), but what about his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psycho-epistemology?  This is somewhat harder to identify, but again his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music can be of assistance, especially a group like Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What distinguishes Yes is its motoric, almost impersonal drive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity.  I don't think it's the impersonality as such that attracted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dirk, since most of his collection was anything but impersonal.  Rather it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would seem to be the machine-like drive and the complexity.  (Think of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradigmatic Yes song &quot;Roundabout.&quot;)  These qualities are shared by Kansas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (think of the relentlessness and the Bach-like piano of &quot;Carry On Our
</em><br>
Native
<br>
<em>&gt; Son&quot;).  Starship and some of Dirk's other discs also share them to a
</em><br>
lesser
<br>
<em>&gt; degree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are three reasons why Dirk and the strident style were made for each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other.  First is that naturalism in the 70s frequently took an assertive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theatrical cast. (Dirk was largely indifferent to &quot;mellow&quot; groups like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bread.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second is Dirk's personality.  Dirk was clinically hyperactive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; congenitally melodramatic.  Truth be told, when Dirk was &quot;up&quot; it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult to share a room with him.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Third and most relevant is a more specifically psycho-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; epistemological factor.  Dirk loved fast, driving, complex,
</em><br>
prestidigitation
<br>
<em>&gt; in music.  I call this esthetic complex &quot;razzmatazz.:&quot;  I chose the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colloquial name because it seems to capture exactly what Dirk loved about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the music in question:  its ability to impress by attracting the
</em><br>
listener's
<br>
<em>&gt; attention and then almost losing it along the way, like a game of
</em><br>
three-card
<br>
<em>&gt; monty.  Razzmatazz represents the energy and enthusiasm Dirk loved and had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in his own life.  (And Dirk would have liked it that I chose a colloquial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term, since he generally believed that a technical or orderly approach to
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; subject was mere pomposity.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Razzmatazz may help explain why Dirk gravitated toward synthesizers and
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; like when he was also proficient on piano, guitar, drums and brass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instruments:  the gee-whiz, high-tech factor appealed to the fast-talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showman in him.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose we could say that a composer like Bach displayed razzmatazz too,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that doesn't seem right, does it?  Bach was reflecting his view of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex, orderly universe.  Razzmatazz, although it surely reflected
</em><br>
Dirk's
<br>
<em>&gt; ability quickly to take up information and to deal with multiple channels
</em><br>
at
<br>
<em>&gt; the same time, seems more to have been about Dirk than about a view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In loving Yes or Kansas or Kenny Loggins, what Dirk loved was his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling that he could bop through the world getting by on his sense of
</em><br>
life.
<br>
<em>&gt; His love of complexity was not primarily about the adoration of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crystalline aspect of the world; it was always about asserting his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personality.  He was trying to impress, and the person he sought most to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impress was himself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The history of Dirk's belief structure confirms this analysis:  Throughout
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his various ideological phases, whether he was a born-again Christian, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free-flowing mystic, or a semi-rational student of psychology (a la
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Meyers-Briggs), behind it all was always Dirk, the prodigy whose smarts
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; intuition could discern the truth and deal with it, not by submission to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something external (like reality or God), but by sheer panache.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now we are able to integrate what we know about Dirk's music with what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know about Dirk.  The linchpin is an intelligent yet rigid subjectivism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dirk had a concept of feelings as the ultimate authority and of conjuring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right &quot;groove&quot; as the proper method for success.  For him style, or
</em><br>
what
<br>
<em>&gt; I call pseudo sense of life, was everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And thus it was he failed.  Not in a glorious battle with the forces of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mediocrity and conformity that he loved to fight, but in sad loneliness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Botched back surgery and a low tolerance for pain (no doubt exacerbated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decades of drug abuse) led him to incapacity and to dependence on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prescription medicine.  The last and most pathetic in a long series of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damaged women whom he both financially exploited and emotionally bolstered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had died.  His father, who had helped get him on public assistance and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provided some emotional sustenance when he was crippled, had died.  Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importantly, even Dirk could surely see that finally his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dreams had died.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One morning in June of 2000, the nurse who helped Dirk with his morphine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patches found him dead.  He had six of the patches on him and over 100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; barbiturate tablets in him.  Whether as his friends believe, it was an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accidental overdose with pill after pill being taken in a daze, or, as his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family believes, it was a suicide, will never be determined with
</em><br>
certainty.
<br>
<em>&gt; There was no note.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't admire subjectivism, and I know it doesn't work.  But I do have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect Dirk, subjectivism and all.  Misguided and crazy as he was his
</em><br>
whole
<br>
<em>&gt; life, he did have a dream and he did pursue it.  I am reminded of a song
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Dirk's collection, perhaps not so atypical as it first may appear to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be:  &quot;Deacon Blues&quot; by Steely Dan.  The song tells the mythic tale of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; young man who goes from being a &quot;nobody&quot; to being a jazz musician, very
</em><br>
much
<br>
<em>&gt; a part of &quot;the life.&quot;  The refrain goes:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Learned to work the saxophone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I play just what I feel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Drink scotch whiskey all night long
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and die behind the wheel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     They got a name for the winners in the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I want a name when I lose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     They call Alabama the Crimson Tide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Call me Deacon Blues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've always loved the twisted perseverance and authenticity of that song,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I guess that's how it was possible for me to love Dirk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So it appears that Ayn Rand was right, that your personality does
</em><br>
determine
<br>
<em>&gt; your musical choices, and one can use your musical tastes to get a handle
</em><br>
on
<br>
<em>&gt; your premises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But Ayn Rand was wrong on another subject: : not all values are chosen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values and not all scars on one's view of existence can be avoided.  Here
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; am referring to myself.  Dirk's life and death have a greater hold on me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than I would ever choose to give them. For you see, &quot;Dirk Douglas&quot; was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stage name which Dirk took as his legal name a decade ago.  His given name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was Dirk Douglas Keefner, and he was my brother.  Perhaps I understand his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brilliance and his madness because they are partly mine as well.  For the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of my life Dirk will have the power to tear me in two, as I laud his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, talent and decency, loathe his self-indulgence and blind
</em><br>
spots
<br>
<em>&gt; and lament his mental illness. No matter how I agonize over his memory,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, I will always be grateful to him for helping to kindle the love
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; music in me.  It is a gift which can never die.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now forgive me, gentle reader, for the deception of not revealing my true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relation to Dirk sooner.  The only way I could stand to write about him
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; the only way I could trust others to think about what I had to say about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him, was by making the subject seem impersonal.  Dirk would have enjoyed
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; gag.
