The US population is a prisoner of the &quot;War on Drugs.&quot;
<br>
<p>Under the aegis of that evil plan, many constitutional guarantees have been voided
<br>
by the state, thus the state voids itself.
<br>
<p>Laws and practices of forfeiture without trial have added corruption to our
<br>
state-sponsored police forces.
<br>
<p>The right to grow hemp as the founding fathers of the country did is disallowed,
<br>
although it was temporarily reallowed during World War II for utilitarian reasons.
<br>
<p>We remain in a state of prohibition, which is almost universally known as the source
<br>
of more crime than it prevents, not to mention the very state of prohibition makes
<br>
actions to be technical illegality of all those against which it is biased.
<br>
<p>The practice of religion allows any to define their own spiritual recourse, I
<br>
interpret that to mean that any can do almost anything which is not a violent nor
<br>
property crime, nor safety hazard to others.  Rather it is to say:  the Constitution
<br>
says we can do these things, and that the state cannot deny that legally.  No
<br>
Constitutional amendment has ever passed to deny that nor to belay the validity of
<br>
the Constitution in any other way, that's why they are Amendments, the government
<br>
can not legally operate outside of its bounds.
<br>
<p>About guns... well... the right to bear arms happens to be a Constitutionally
<br>
defined freedom, and quite a literal one.  I am of the mind that any adult without
<br>
violent or dangerous history should be able to collect fully automatic weapons.
<br>
<p>About martial law, there are various ways to influence the population.  Perhaps most
<br>
critically, if the population is content and thinks itself free from martial law,
<br>
then it is less likely to revolt.  There are several figurative opiates.
<br>
<p>About gun threads on extropians, I would prefer to talk about exotic super-weapons.

<em>&gt; We've got a moderately long way to go before anybody but the wild-eyed
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actual martial law might put a crimp in that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That said, consider that some fairly reliable sources suggest that, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name a high profile example, some people suggest that the active
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stimulating a disproportionate inappropriate reply in force is part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the standard tactics of low-intensity/insurgent/guerilla politics/war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if, hypothetically, the heat ever gets turned up on the US population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in general, and the &quot;sufferance&quot; of which you speak turns to more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious _suffering_, it still won't in all likelihood be the general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population (appearing to be) doing the fighting. But the idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fighting pitched battles with &quot;fronts&quot; and so forth is terribly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last-century.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Speak not of Revolution / until you are willing to eat rats to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive.&quot; -- The Last Poets
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most people 'round here are not in a rat-eating mood; that's about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; size of it. May it ever be thus, for _good_ reason. Readers of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Echelon transcript, please note this paragraph. I am not in rat-eating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mode, either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Another consideration is that nanotech and AI may eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the relevance of firearms.  That may be true one of these days
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; but we are not there now.  We may someday live in utopia but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think there is a good chance that even after nanotech and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; AI we will still have a need for self-defense (perhaps even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; more so).  Firearms may someday cease to be relevant but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; combat mentality and concepts that you learn will still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; apply.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No, actually the whole idea is that nanotech/AI/superintelligence scenario is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hopefully alien enough to eliminate even the need for self-defensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinking.  My own philosophy is that the future is so distant - not just in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terms of the environment, but in terms of who we will be - that the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; course is to try and be the most intense human you can be, here and now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without moping too much over how much better you would be if you didn't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be human.  Arguably, firearms - and to an even greater extent, martial arts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - are a part of that.  The question, as always, is time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cheerio. The one rhetorical card I see you palming in the above is &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole idea&quot; s/b &quot;my [Eliezer's] whole idea&quot;. :) You're still doing 'way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better than most politicians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, I have a hunch.  It's just an idea and it may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; apply to everyone.  It's only something I feel and I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; even sure it applies to me yet.  I think really knowing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; you can defend yourself is good for your energy level and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; peace of mind.  It may be a biological effect of vigorous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and complex physical training. [...]  It may also be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that our brains also still respond to a pecking order system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; which recognizes self-defense ability as a key dominance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; trait.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yep, that's the one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It can also be read as &quot;I have a handle on a piece of what the Universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can dish out, insofar as I am able.&quot;
