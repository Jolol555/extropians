</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Mindset:
<br>
<p>&quot;We're going to make a space company.  We're going to have lots of fun.
<br>
We're going to break the patterns.  We'll pay lip service to actually
<br>
launching stuff since we can get money much faster by getting investors
<br>
hyped on the promise.  Not that we're lying: we honestly hope and
<br>
believe that we'll build a launcher.  It's just that selling the dream
<br>
is much more profitable than trying to realize the dream, and business
<br>
comes first.
<br>
<p>&quot;...what do you *mean*, the investors actually want to see stuff in
<br>
orbit?  Panicpanicpanic!  Oh, well, we've burned through all our money.
<br>
Say, how's Cousin Dotcom doing?&quot;
<br>
<p>Or is that too cynical a summary?  (This is why, if I ever do a space
<br>
company, I will try to have a home-built launcher that I've actually
<br>
flown *before* going out for funding.  A development process that
<br>
requires $millions before doing the first non-simulated test is not as
<br>
likely to produce results as one that does not.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For myself, at least, I've think I've finally gotten to the point that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't be fooled again.  The technology just hasn't gotten to the point that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private venture investment can make a go of it.  There aren't any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intermediate steps to orbit to establish an incremental approach that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smaller, private ventures can build on one step at a time: The initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threshold of success is just too high.  Until material and manufacturing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology get to the point where a relatively small group of people can make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a go of it n one relatively short push from start to finish, I think space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access will continue to be the domain of governments and huge institutions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Go nanotech!
</em><br>
<p>Go buisness model!  I honestly don't see where the material and
<br>
manufacturing tech ever held these ventures up, so much as the fact
<br>
that they never got around to *using* even the cheap stuff that's out
<br>
there.
