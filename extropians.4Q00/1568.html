</em><br>
<p>I don't have all the answers, and I'm always surprised at those who can 
<br>
answer enough of the many questions that exist--even answer them 
<br>
tentatively--to create the necessary foundation for an extended discussion.
<br>
<p>Perhaps there are many civilizations, but few individuals, so, they simply 
<br>
don't need to use it all.  Perhaps, like humans, as they get more advanced 
<br>
materially, they reproduce less.    Or perhaps, as they become more 
<br>
advanced, they cease to be biological and simply disable/dispose of 
<br>
the biological compulsion to reproduce.
<br>
<p>Since some substantial portion of the mass of the universe is &quot;dark matter&quot;
<br>
--whatever that means(more questions; more assumptions required)--perhaps 
<br>
they in fact do intercept the energy, and what we see is what remains, unused 
<br>
for reasons other than inability, and we simply don't see that yet.  Perhaps 
<br>
transcendent intelligence is easy once intelligence is achieved, much easier 
<br>
than intelligence itself.  Perhaps the answers gleaned--the understanding
<br>
of the 
<br>
nature of existence--from transcendent intelligence make it possible and 
<br>
desireable to go 'elsewhere', and the transcendent beings have left the
<br>
nest.  
<br>
Perhaps this material realm is not more used because the nature of
<br>
intelligence 
<br>
is such that THAT is its function: it is the nursery of the gods.  No way, of 
<br>
course, this idea is even remotely original.
<br>
<p>Some people insist that species expansion and thorough use of resources is 
<br>
Darwinian and inescapable.  I consider it possible, if not likely, that 
<br>
intelligence may be able to modify relentless Darwinism, perhaps by creating 
<br>
a Darwinism of memes.  This might result in what seems to me--with my 
<br>
limited and fallible human-level cognitive ability--an intelligent approach 
<br>
to galactic resource management, a kind of galactic conservationist ethic.  
<br>
Alternately or additionally, if resources vastly outstrip needs--and we
<br>
really 
<br>
don't know what the needs of advanced civilizations would be--perhaps the 
<br>
dreams of jupiter/matrioshka brain intelligence can be achieved with much 
<br>
less resource conversion than we imagine, from where we sit.  Perhaps, as 
<br>
has been mentioned in discussions of j/m brains, there is an inherent
<br>
size-limit 
<br>
arising from the nature of the matter from which these intelligences would be 
<br>
built.  This, for me is a case of more questions, without more answers.  
<br>
Additionally, I can only guess what a vastly transcendent civilization/being 
<br>
would be like, would want to achieve, how they would be motivated.  Perhaps 
<br>
a superconductive, supercold, superefficient, nanodetailed, energy-conserving 
<br>
brain might do.  Bigger may not be necessary, much less better.  I don't
<br>
know, 
<br>
how could I know?  This is not to say that speculation isn't fun, or that the 
<br>
drawing of conclusions, bold though it may be, is not 'allowed'.  But I get 
<br>
amused when people get convinced and insistent and demand sturdy regimens 
<br>
of falsification.  We're all like Wily E. Coyote, out over the edge, held
<br>
up by 
<br>
nothing more than the momentary pause which gravity allows for the
<br>
appreciation 
<br>
of the consequences of hubris.
