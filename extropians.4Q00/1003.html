</em><br>
<p>Speaking as one of the people who was strongly in favor of calling it
<br>
&quot;Practical Optimism,&quot; I take issue.
<br>
<p>Optimism is optimism.  The question is only whether you'll have
<br>
optimism in a constructive way or in a destructive way.
<br>
<p>When I told people that extropy is about &quot;dynamic optimism,&quot; they
<br>
didn't hear the word &quot;dynamic.&quot;  They didn't see that we're
<br>
prepared to shift strategies in order to move forward.  All they saw
<br>
was the &quot;optimism;&quot; calling it &quot;dynamic&quot; was merely there for
<br>
emphasis, as far as they were concerned.
<br>
<p>For all the connotations are worth, being &quot;dynamically optimistic&quot;
<br>
doesn't sound significantly different from being &quot;extremely
<br>
optimistic.&quot;  But there's more to be said about the principle than
<br>
that, as you know.  I think &quot;Practical Optimism&quot; communicates the mood
<br>
correctly.
<br>
<p>We're still headed for space; we're still aiming for boundless
<br>
expansion, and we still think that we'll get there.  But now people
<br>
know that we're not just HOPING to get into space; we think we're
<br>
*going* to get there, by doing what we have to do to bring about
<br>
progress.  We're *smart* optimists, which is what &quot;dynamic optimism&quot;
<br>
failed to communicate.
<br>
<p>As for Perpetual Progress replacing Boundless Expansion... who cares
<br>
about &quot;bigger&quot;?  What we want is to get *better*.  Boundless Expansion
<br>
connotes that bigger is better, a half-baked philosophical principle
<br>
that nobody here endorsed.  I worry that you're right that Perpetual
<br>
Progress doesn't sound as good as Boundless Expansion, though.
<br>
<p>As for Spontaneous Order...  did Spontaneous Order mean something
<br>
different for you than Open Society, Self Direction and Rational
<br>
Thinking?  Something else?
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------
<br>
<p>To play the devil's advocate, there IS something else I meant by
<br>
Spontaneous Order isn't captured in the current list.
<br>
<p>As far as the philosophy of mind goes, I'm a functionalist.  I think
<br>
that things that act like brains are conscious.  Some people
<br>
occasionally try to run a certain kind of reductio ad absurdum
<br>
argument on functionalists, arguing: &quot;What if a whole group of people
<br>
got together and started acting like individual neurons, and their
<br>
neuron-like activity made them act just like a brain?  Would THAT make
<br>
their organization conscious?&quot;  I answer yes.  I think this happens to
<br>
be one of the deeply interesting facts about our world.
<br>
<p>Autocatalysis is one of the things intelligence does, IMO.  It's a
<br>
necessary but insufficient condition for being smart.  Things that
<br>
achieve Spontaneous Order are important in their own right, because
<br>
they have one of those special characteristics that smart things have.
<br>
<p>Not coincidentally, almost everything we take to be beautiful, or even
<br>
interesting, is Spontaneously Ordered.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying that all Spontaneously Ordered systems should be
<br>
granted rights or anything like that... I'm just saying that such
<br>
systems are inherently interesting, and important.  That's something
<br>
the current principles don't take into account.  Maybe they shouldn't,
<br>
for the same reason we shouldn't call it &quot;dynamic optimism.&quot;  But *I*
<br>
really like Spontaneous Order.  I think it's cool.
<br>
<p>That's all.  :)
