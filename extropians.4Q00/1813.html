<p>WHY  GUNS?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- by L. Neil Smith --
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the &quot;Webley Page&quot; &lt;<a href="http://webley.zq.com/lneil/">http://webley.zq.com/lneil/</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 30 years, I've been paid to write almost two
<br>
million words, every one of which, sooner or later, came back to the
<br>
issue of guns and gun-ownership.  Naturally, I've thought about the
<br>
issue a lot, and it has _always_ determined the way I vote.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People accuse me of being a single-issue writer, a single-issue
<br>
thinker, and a single-issue voter, but it isn't true.  What I've
<br>
chosen, in a world where there's never enough time and energy, is to
<br>
focus on the one political issue which most clearly and unmistakably
<br>
demonstrates what any politician -- or political philosophy -- is
<br>
made of, right down to the creamy liquid center.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make no mistake:  all politicians -- even those ostensibly on
<br>
the side of guns and gun ownership -- hate the issue and anyone,
<br>
like me, who insists on bringing it up.  They hate it because
<br>
because it's an X-ray machine.  It's a Vulcan mind-meld. It's the
<br>
ultimate test to which any politician -- or political philosophy --
<br>
can be put.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a politician isn't perfectly comfortable with the idea of his
<br>
average constituent, any man, woman, or responsible child, walking
<br>
into a hardware store and paying cash -- for any rifle, shotgun,
<br>
handgun, machinegun, _anything_ -- without producing ID or signing
<br>
one scrap of paper, he isn't your _friend_ no matter what he tells
<br>
you.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he isn't genuinely enthusiastic about his average constituent
<br>
stuffing that weapon into a purse or pocket or tucking it under a
<br>
coat and walking home without asking anybody's permission, he's a
<br>
four-flusher, no matter what he claims.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What his attitude -- toward your ownership and use of weapons --
<br>
conveys is his real attitude about _you_.  And if he doesn't trust
<br>
you, then why in the name of John Moses Browning should you trust
<br>
him?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he doesn't want you to have the means of defending your life,
<br>
do you want him in a position to control it?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he makes excuses about obeying a law he's sworn to uphold and
<br>
defend -- the highest law of the land, the Bill of Rights -- do you
<br>
want to entrust him with _anything_?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he ignores you, sneers at you, complains about you, or
<br>
defames you, if he calls you names only he thinks are evil -- like
<br>
&quot;Constitutionalist&quot; -- when you insist that he account for himself,
<br>
hasn't he betrayed his oath, isn't he unfit to hold office, and
<br>
doesn't he really belong in _jail_?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, these are all leading questions.  They're the questions
<br>
that led me to the issue of guns and gun ownership as the clearest
<br>
and most unmistakable demonstration of what any given politician --
<br>
or political philosophy -- is really made of.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may lecture you about the dangerous weirdos out there who
<br>
shouldn't have a gun -- but what does that have to do with you? Why
<br>
in the name of John Moses Browning should you be made to suffer for
<br>
the misdeeds of others?  Didn't you lay aside the infantile notion
<br>
of group punishment when you left public school -- or the military?
<br>
Isn't it an essentially European notion, anyway -- Prussian, maybe
<br>
-- and certainly not what America was supposed to be all about?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if there are dangerous weirdos out there, does it make sense
<br>
to deprive you of the means of protecting yourself from them?
<br>
Forget about those other people, those dangerous weirdos, this is
<br>
about _you_, and it has been, all along.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try it yourself:  if a politician won't trust you, why should
<br>
you trust him?  If he's a man -- and you're not -- what does his
<br>
lack of trust tell you about his real attitude toward women?  If
<br>
&quot;he&quot; happens to be a _woman_, what makes her so perverse that she's
<br>
eager to render her fellow women helpless on the mean and seedy
<br>
streets her policies helped create?  Should you believe her when she
<br>
says she wants to help you by imposing some infantile group health
<br>
care program on you at the point of the kind of gun she doesn't want
<br>
you to have?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand -- or the other party -- should you believe
<br>
anything politicians say who claim they stand for freedom, but drag
<br>
their feet and make excuses about repealing limits on your right to
<br>
own and carry weapons?  What does this tell you about their real
<br>
motives for ignoring voters and ramming through one infantile group
<br>
trade agreement after another with other countries?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes voting simpler, doesn't it?  You don't have to study every
<br>
issue -- health care, international trade -- all you have to do is
<br>
use this X-ray machine, this Vulcan mind-meld, to get beyond their
<br>
empty words and find out how politicians really feel.  About you.
<br>
And that, of course, is why they hate it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's why I'm accused of being a single-issue writer,
<br>
thinker, and voter.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it isn't true, is it?
