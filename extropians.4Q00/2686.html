<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt; &gt; The future of science and technology are not mystical, not magick,
<br>
not&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mysterious.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;&gt;Arthur C. Clarke would disagree with that statement...&lt;&lt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where? If it's the line (to paraphrase)about a sufficiently advanced
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technology being indistinguishable from science -- you should tried
<br>
reading
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it more closely. A more primitive civilization would mistake the advanced
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technology for magic, just like a Bronze Age warrior would think a gun is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;magic. For the wielders of said technology, it wouldn't be -- they would
<br>
know
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exactly how and why it works. The future is mysterious to us because we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;haven't see it yet.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;&gt;Anyway, since when is our destiny of a mundane nature?  This notion has
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only been commonly believed for a very short duration of humanity's
<br>
existence-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd also argue that this notion is purely transitionary, a kind of
<br>
collective
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;dark night of the soul&quot; (as a mystic would put it) before our initiation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the Transhuman existence...&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During that &quot;short duration,&quot; more human progress has been achieved than
<br>
in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all of previous human history. Apparently, this &quot;dark night&quot; really
<br>
produces
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;results! I fervently pray (to a non-existent God) that this never ends.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we started stripping the world from its mystical-religious
<br>
trappings,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we lived huddled in the dark, utterly helpless before the forces of
<br>
nature.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No thanks.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt; A transhuman is not supernatural.
</em><br>
<p><em>   &gt;&gt;We don't know this.  I, for one, think that it must be... if this
</em><br>
wasn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the case, we would certainly be awash in signals from alien civilizations
<br>
and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others that still live tied to their mundane existence, eternally
<br>
expanding,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conquering, warring... remember, there were numerous second-generation
<br>
stars
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that matured billions of years before our own Sun, and odds are that in a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self-organizing universe many intelligent races could have developed and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eventually reached their own singularity, in which, through technological
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means, they advanced to a state that is beyond our comprehension, and
<br>
could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only be seen as divine.  The only way we could even hope to perceive
<br>
aslight
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bit of the nature of such beings is through mystical means.  Even the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever hard-nosed Carl Sagan proposed something to this effect in
<br>
&quot;Contact&quot;,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he mentioned the idea of a species that had reached a state beyond
<br>
our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imagination designing patterns in the physical universe that could only
<br>
be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read through mathematical codes... maybe the Kabbalists are on to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;something...&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please. The only way for us to get to understand such a species is for us
<br>
to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*raise ourselves to that level.* If we have to approach them (assuming
<br>
the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exist) as ignorant, trembling supplicants, we deserve whatever we get.
<br>
When
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commodore Perry sailed into Japan with a mighty warship, the Japanese
<br>
could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have just fallen to their knees and worshipped him. Instead, in a few
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generations they had warships of their own. Mystics simply believe their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;powers of reasoning are incapable of understanding the universe, and that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only some esoteric means will do it. So far, science keeps kicking them
<br>
out
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of more and more realms of nature, as our observation tools and methods,
<br>
and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our understanding of the universe, continues to grow. The track record of
<br>
the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mystics and religionists, to put it kindly, sucks. None of their
<br>
predictions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has ever come true.
<br>
<p><p>samantha:
<br>
People that know very little about mysticism (and knowing only the
<br>
dictionary definition is VERY little) really should not presume to say what
<br>
mystics &quot;simply believe&quot;.  Some types of mystics believe that reason is
<br>
supreme and transcends its own seeming limits if applied rigorously and
<br>
honestly enough.  Check out Jnana Yoga.  Science for all of its acheivments
<br>
is so far up against the wall on value and &quot;meaning of it all&quot; type
<br>
questions and issues.  Some go so far as to say that if science cannot
<br>
address these things then they do not exist!  This is as blind as a
<br>
medievalist claiming that what is not in the bible is either false or not
<br>
important anyway.  Mysticism/religion sucks at describing physical reality.
<br>
But then, that was not its stated intent.  Foretelling the future is also
<br>
not its purpose all though some mystical/religous groups lower themselves to
<br>
acting as if it is.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt; Capital 'P' Powers are not amazing or incredible, they are merely
</em><br>
currently
<br>
<em>   &gt; inscrutable.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they're inscrutable, they very well could be amazing and incredible.
<br>
You
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't know this- nor do I.&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having, in the past, found that events and phenomena that were previously
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inscrutable (how did the sun burn, for example) have been logically and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;falsifiably explained, one can logically infer that what is now
<br>
inscrutable
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will also, eventually, be logically and falsifiably explained. To believe
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise is to deny four centuries of human progress. Now, it is
<br>
possible
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that at some point we might run into a wall that science and reason
<br>
cannot
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knock down -- but if one must have faith in something, I thing faith in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;science and reason is more sensible -- they have delivered a great deal
<br>
more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the alternatives.
<br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
Actually not all things believed to be true in science are falsfiable today.
<br>
<em>&gt;From the fact that science and technology have delivered much it does not
</em><br>
follow that all else is utterly pointless and to be discarded.
