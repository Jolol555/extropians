<p><em>&gt;  A philosophical problem, that cuts much, much deeper than
</em><br>
&quot;political views&quot;, and I think it is down to the core- and that
<br>
makes transhumanism very much weaker than it should be.&lt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Today transhumanism should be out of the basement but it isn't.&lt;
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure it's been in the basement -- but perhaps the drawing
<br>
room, classroom, study, studio or lift-off platform.  If we are
<br>
discussing philosophical issues, then surely you must agree that
<br>
both Max More and FM-2030 have provided a broad intellectual
<br>
bandwidth of data, in their separate but paralleling views, which
<br>
has been the foundation of transhumanism. Such views have been
<br>
and continue to be given considerable exposure.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I've given the list my views and a scetch on remedies, a bit
</em><br>
long, but these things aren't discussed in a 1K mail.
<br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Rather I think that a more intellectual approach is needed,
</em><br>
and a move away 
<br>
<em>&gt;  from activism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Views?
</em><br>
<p>By intellectual, do you mean a more literary, cultural approach
<br>
which brings in a wider and finely tuned audience?
<br>
<p>My views are that much of the hard work in memetic engineering
<br>
is first to establish a belief system or understanding.  Spinning
<br>
off the initial work requires the synergistic talents of individuals
<br>
who can design ways to implement and incorporate the basic ideas
<br>
into culture *AND* to enrich the ideas by branching out.  The
<br>
branches are developed by those whose keen insights help to take
<br>
the initial ideas and discover new or alternative ways these
<br>
ideas can spread.  
<br>
<p>This spreading of the initial philosophy of transhumanism and
<br>
new ways of seeing or understanding transhumanism has certainly
<br>
been fluid and continues to grow.
<br>
<p>Secondly, transhumanism was not a philosophy for me when I wrote
<br>
the Transhumanist Statement in 1982.  It was a way of viewing
<br>
the world around me from a *aesthetic, technological and scientific*
<br>
point of view.  This view was designed to introduce others to
<br>
the possibilities of superlongevity, biotechnology and future
<br>
technologies, space exploration, augmenting intelligence and
<br>
creativity and the future Creativity Augmentum.  I felt that
<br>
it was a creative and artistic way of viewing the world and the
<br>
art of life.
