That was only the previous version. I recall an earlier one when the
<br>
error message was &quot;Ugh!&quot;, which eventually became &quot;Faugh!&quot;, which
<br>
evolved into our modern scatology. Programs weren't written onto media,
<br>
they were built into the mechanism, so you needed a new computer for
<br>
each program you wanted to run. Because most investors demanded to see a
<br>
functioning example of your program AND a government patent before they
<br>
would invest in its development, and no governments would issue patents
<br>
without a functioning model that demonstrated itself to be better than
<br>
previous models, few applications were thus written, and the world
<br>
wallowed in misery and low levels of productivity for millenia.
