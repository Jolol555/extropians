<em>&gt;Do others do that? Meaning, do you see the correct words, even when they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  actually something else?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Like stereotyping, it's a reflex that keeps you from getting 
<br>
bogged down in all the details over-analyzing every stimulus that 
<br>
comes your way.  The tradeoff between absolute comprehension and 
<br>
real-time responsiveness is something that we all deal with to some 
<br>
extent.
<br>
<p>Any AI created will also have this problem, in some fashion.  It will 
<br>
have to strike some sort of balance between analyzing every possible 
<br>
meaning of the data presented to it, and guessing at the most likely 
<br>
ones.  Just because it'll be a very fast machine doesn't mean that it 
<br>
won't be attempting to maximize the amount of information that it can 
<br>
process in a &quot;useful&quot; manner.
<br>
<p>Pattern recognition software suffers from this problem now.  That 
<br>
reminds me of an old &quot;The Simpsons&quot; where Nelson takes Martin's 
<br>
Newton and writes a reminder: &quot;Beat up Martin&quot;.  It comes out as &quot;Eat 
<br>
up Martha&quot; or something... okay, so maybe you had to see it firsthand.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
