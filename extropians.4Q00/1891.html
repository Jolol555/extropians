<p>Mike, I am certainly no fan of the FDA, but I think I have to side with them
<br>
on this one.  The food in question is engineered to produce its own
<br>
pesticide.  This new corn is not chemically equivalent to natural corn, but
<br>
is chemically equivalent to natural corn plus pesticide.  The pesticide has
<br>
not been tested for human safety.  As with any new pesticide or food
<br>
additive, companies are not allowed to put this in human food until it has
<br>
been tested for human consumption.
<br>
<p>I think this is a perfectly good recall.
<br>
<p>1. The company in question accidentally put animal-grade food into human
<br>
food.  I wouldn't want to eat this any more than I would eat dog food.
<br>
<p>2. The company accidentally put an experimental food additive into human
<br>
food before the testing was complete.  I wouldn't want to eat this any more
<br>
than I would eat any experimental foods before the experiments were
<br>
finished.
<br>
<p>3. The company failed to follow existing health laws while mixing this food.
<br>
I wouldn't want to eat this any more than I would want to eat at a
<br>
restaurant that failed its health inspection.
<br>
<p>Sure, it probably is safe, but why take chances?  I eat only human-grade
<br>
food, not experimental food, and not from companies that break health laws.
<br>
I will experiment with my own life-extension supplements, but only after I
<br>
read the scientific evidence myself and make my own choices.  I don't want
<br>
another company making that decision for me.
