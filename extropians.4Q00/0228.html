<em>&gt; writes:&lt;&lt; I had referred to willing warriors, eager soldiers, those who

<em>&gt; Somewhere I heard that only about four percent of men are truly warrior 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>While four percent sounds like a rather arbitrary number (I would be
<br>
interested in knowing the source for this), fitness as a warrior does seem
<br>
to follow a Pareto distribution.  A lot of research has been done regarding
<br>
the actual behavior of men in combat versus the idealized or expected
<br>
behavior, mostly in the mid-20th century.  As has been noted by many
<br>
military researchers, the *majority* of men won't even fire their weapon
<br>
during combat, some not even in defense of their own lives.  Additionally,
<br>
for a given infantry unit, a handful of individuals are usually
<br>
responsible for inflicting the vast majority of casualties on the enemy. 
<br>
These and other comprehensive studies of *actual* combat behavior were
<br>
significant factors in the shift of US military doctrine in the 20th
<br>
century, which had previously been driven by a rather idealized vision of
<br>
the average soldier.
<br>
<p>Now that I think about it, that four percent figure is probably pretty
<br>
close to the correct figure for the percentage of men who have both the
<br>
mental and physical competencies required for superior combat
<br>
performance.  Obviously, people who have what it takes tend to concentrate
<br>
in the more &quot;elite&quot; units as they self-select for these traits; the
<br>
concentration of good warriors diffuses rapidly as one descends the
<br>
military unit heirarchy and into the support units.  To a signficant
<br>
extent, the mental aspect (which is most of it) is environmental and can
<br>
be trained into people, although the military has to work from the
<br>
baseline of the population it draws from.
<br>
<p>To expand the topic, in my experience, while a small but
<br>
significant percentage of women have the emotional hardness required (our
<br>
current environment doesn't seem to encourage this very much), only a very
<br>
tiny percentage have the innate combat awareness to make them truly
<br>
effective warriors.  This is probably a gender specific mental adaptation,
<br>
and it really becomes apparent under observation.  Women approach a hot
<br>
combat situation very differently than men, and arguably much less
<br>
efficiently due to apparently inferior situational awareness during
<br>
combat.  The differences seem (to me anyway) to be based largely on how the
<br>
two genders obtain and maintain their situational awareness.
