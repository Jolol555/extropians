Rotation. For long-term inhabitance of micro-G environment, we need 
<br>
centrifugal force in large to very large structures that rotate or are round 
<br>
in nature. Hollow Donuts, Hollow Spheres, hollow cylanders--all larger then 
<br>
anything we have ever had in space is need. Its tricks the cells that 
<br>
comprise living matter to behave as if its subjected to a gravity field. The 
<br>
heart pumps and blood pulls against a downward force, to be circulated back 
<br>
thru the upper extremities and head. Chewed food gets pulled down to the 
<br>
tummy (as with gravity) through centrifugal force (inertia). We need huge 
<br>
structures in space to sustain biotic life. Silicon life or Biosilicate life 
<br>
certainly will faire better.

<p><p><em>&gt; Everyone here knows that the biggest problem for long term space travel, at
