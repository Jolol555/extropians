<em>&gt; Well yes of course you can't literally change the past, any more than you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can literally change the future.  If you learn something about the way the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future will be, via a time machine or something else, then you are stuck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with that being the way the future will be no matter what you do.
</em><br>
<p>Are you saying that the reason you can't change the future is because of
<br>
the possible existence of time machines?  That doesn't seem to be a very
<br>
strong argument, since it is not yet known if time machines can exist.
<br>
<p>Or are there other reasons you can't literally change the future?
<br>
For example, in a deterministic universe there is a sense in which you
<br>
can't change the future, because you can't make any choices, they are
<br>
pre-ordained.  Is this the kind of thing you mean?
<br>
<p>I think most people would say that you can change the future but you
<br>
can't change the past, and that this is one of the features that most
<br>
prominently distinguishes the future from the past.
<br>
<p>And this distinction is very relevant, because the paper's analysis relies
<br>
on a certain equivalence between our attitudes towards the future and
<br>
towards the past, which some of us are challenging.  If the future is
<br>
much like the past, that strengthens the paper's position.  However if
<br>
the future is fundamentally different from the past, so different that our
<br>
attitudes towards future events must be fundamentally different from our
<br>
attitudes towards past events, then that tends to undercut the analysis.
