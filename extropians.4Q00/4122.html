<p>
I get amused when people assume that all good genes must already be 
<br>
in play, or else evolution would have utilized them.  There is not 
<br>
good reason to assume that evolution is perfect, has the best 
<br>
solution, or has finished it work.
<br>
<p>Evolution works by random mutation.  It is very likely that there are 
<br>
still beneficial genes that have not been expressed yet.
<br>
<p>Survival of the fittest only causes the fittest in a particular 
<br>
contest to survive.  It does not mean that the best solution has been 
<br>
found, merely that the best thus far is chosen above lessor solutions.
<br>
<p>Finally, evolution isn't over yet.  Evolution can still create better 
<br>
and better solutions.  We cannot assume that every solution found in 
<br>
the genome has been tried and rejected.  There very well could be 
<br>
very good solutions that either were wiped out by a single unexpected 
<br>
event, or else which haven't expressed themselves or been given a 
<br>
chance to compete yet.
