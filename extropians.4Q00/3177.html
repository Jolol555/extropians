this coming from Strong memorial hospital, notorious for feeding people
<br>
plutonium in the '40's because &quot;we wanted to see what would happen&quot;.  
<br>
<p>But anyway, Heinlen proposed the idea behind the explanation of why we
<br>
laugh.  In Stranger in a Strange land, the protagonist pointed out that we
<br>
only laugh at things that are wrong with the world.  This does of course
<br>
leave out the laugh of the conformist, but it is the basis behind most
<br>
laughter.  Why this is could be explained by the theory on why we're
<br>
tickled.
<br>
<p>According to studies, I'll confess I don't know which, we get tickled due
<br>
to internal conflict.  Our bodies naturally reject being touched in that 
<br>
way as a loss of safety, yet we also internally know that we aren't at a
<br>
threat.  Hence internal conflict, and our body doesn't know how to react
<br>
so it basically responds with a mild form of hysteria.  There are other
<br>
reasons such as mere nerve reactions to a stimuli such as slowly rubbing
<br>
your finger across the inside of your palm.  An easy way to tell which is
<br>
which is that your body, unless psychologically 'different' won't react in
<br>
such a manner to your own touch because it lacks the internal conflict
<br>
behind it.
<br>
<p>for a better worded version:
<br>
<p><a href="http://digitalcity.drkoop.com/news/stories/september/r/tickle.html">http://digitalcity.drkoop.com/news/stories/september/r/tickle.html</a>
<br>
<p>My theory is that if we're laughing at things which are wrong with the
<br>
world, it stems from a similar internal conflict.  We hear something which
<br>
appears intrinsically wrong based on our moral programming, yet we find
<br>
the situation to be distant from our lives so we respond with a mild
<br>
hysteria.  For those who laugh at things close to them, it's a matter of
<br>
dislike of something, yet not being sure as to whether or not it's wrong,
<br>
or blaming themselves, etc...
<br>
<p>Hence you'll find poeple with high moral standards that they're sure of
<br>
less likely to laugh.  Or people who're sure they've been wronged in their
<br>
life, or someone close to them has as unlikely candidates for laughter
<br>
when a related joke is presented.

<p><em>&gt; Dean K. Shibata, M.D., has discovered that humor appreciation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - our ability to recognize a joke - appears to be based in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lower frontal lobes of the brain. It is the first study that captures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; images of the brain, using functional magnetic resonance imaging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (FMRI), to determine what areas become active when we experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something humorous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Why do we laugh? No one really knows,&quot; Shibata said. &quot;But knowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which areas of the brain are involved gives us an idea of how humor is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processed, what functions it may be related to, and ultimately how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it may have developed. This is important because it provides insight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into social and emotional behavior, and how we communicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and foster relationships.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Connecting the brain's response to humor, which plays a powerful role
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in shaping our personalities, is significant for many reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It could aid physicians in diagnosing and treating patients with mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illness or mood disorders such as depression, by showing the brain's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response to positive stimuli. Traditionally, research has focused on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain's response to negative emotions such as fear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It could provide surgeons with valuable pre-operative mapping of the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas critical for maintaining the emotions and social behaviors that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make up our personalities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It advances science, proving the value of new and sophisticated tools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can provide glimpses into the brain and how it works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It helps to demonstrate that mental activity, even one as evanescent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and complex as humor, has a physical correlate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other studies, involving stroke and seizure patients, have tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correlate brain abnormalities with either uncontrollable laughing episodes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a loss of the sense of humor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But in Shibata's research, MRI scans were performed on 13 normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volunteers in a series of four exams. The scans directly visualized what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parts of the brain were involved when the subjects read written jokes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewed cartoons and listened to digital recordings of laughter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The MRI scans showed that when the subjects saw the jokes and cartoons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - tasks that require a decoding of the humorous stimuli - the brain activity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was most prominent in the ventromedial frontal lobe. This suggests that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frontal lobe is responsible for telling us what's funny.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But when they heard laughter and laughed along internally, a response
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known as contagious laughter, the activity was centered in the anterior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supplemental motor area. That part of the frontal lobe near the top of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain is normally associated with planning complex movements and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiating speech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All four scans also showed activity in a small spot at the base of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain, called the nucleus accumbens, an interesting area associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with positive emotions in animals and identified as a key site in moderating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drug addiction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Activity in the nucleus accumbens is likely related to our feeling of mirth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after hearing a good joke and our &quot;addiction&quot; to humor, Shibata said.
