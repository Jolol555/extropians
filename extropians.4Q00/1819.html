<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; So far, no one has been able to point up a single proven instance of gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; restrictions bringing a reduction in crime. There are incidents on record,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I seem to dimly remember a period, where all the GUNS and GUNS and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;GUNS were driving the list crazy, and a temporary moratorium was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;ensued. I for one am sick and tired of these recurring discussions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;which go exactly nowhere apart from eating up bandwidth, and would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;like the ban to become permanent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why are Europeans, especially from Germany so fond of banning speech?
</em><br>
<p>Was this really called for?  The point is valid.  95% of those who are 
<br>
going to get this thread have already made up their minds, and won't change 
<br>
them.  Spending time in a moral morass where you won't ever develop a 
<br>
unanimous feeling isn't the way to go forward - it's an arguement for the 
<br>
status quo.
<br>
<p>I was the one who initially asked the question, &quot;why here?&quot; and I think that
<br>
the answer is clear.  It will accomplish nothing but generating a lot of heat
<br>
and no light.
<br>
<p>And to those who cry &quot;freedom of speech&quot; I offer you this notion, given to me
<br>
by my atheist/skeptic ex-roommate, which sums up why the freedom of speech is
<br>
not absolute.
<br>
<p>(paraphrased)
<br>
<p>Almost every Western culture has this scourge known as the Jehova's Witnesses.
<br>
These people go door to door, peddling a meme that most people reject, and in
<br>
fact it becomes something of a joke in many places - how will you best offend/
<br>
drive off these peddlers of religion from your door?  
<br>
<p>What renders these people an idle curiosity and less of a direct threat or 
<br>
major nuisance/irritant is that you have at any time the freedom to tell them
<br>
that you're not interested, that you've already made up your mind, and to go
<br>
home and leave you alone.  Simply having the freedom to express yourself 
<br>
does not mean you have the right to force your expression upon others.  The
<br>
First Amendment  (to the US Constitution) does not give you the right to 
<br>
free time on all television networks so you can get your right to speak.
<br>
<p>(end of point)
<br>
<p>The point can be made that there was already a good place to take this 
<br>
discussion (and a gentle nudge that it should be taken there) where those
<br>
who want to engage in it can speak to their heart's content.  It seems there's
<br>
a lot of people here who seem to be done with this discussion, and would
<br>
like to see it go somewhere else to refine itself before it comes back.
<br>
<p>I've spoken my own peace in this subject, and it seems that my personal
<br>
beleifs on it are very rare, to listen to people line up on either side
<br>
of the issue - I'm a moderate.  Not wishy-washy, but not absolutist on
<br>
either side.  So don't tell me &quot;You're in favor of childkillers and drive-bys&quot;
<br>
or &quot;you're just one step shy of the Gestapo and would rather that people
<br>
not have a way to defend themselves&quot;.  Both sides are allowed to hate me, 
<br>
and they'll find I don't care.  I'm not &quot;undecided&quot; - I refuse to play the
<br>
&quot;My way or the highway&quot; game.
<br>
<p>Now, if this kind of fervor could be stirred up over the colonization of
<br>
space - THAT is something I would bite for.  And it seems far more relevant 
<br>
in the long run than the question of today's choice in slugthrowers.
<br>
