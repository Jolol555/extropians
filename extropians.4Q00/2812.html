<p><em>&gt; Hmm, so if neobioconservatives hardwire their children for a &quot;natural&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lifespan and add in some genetic diseases to give them a taste of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human condition, we should applaud it? After all, things like that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will increase the range of human variation, and it may turn out that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is actually a good idea as suggested by one of the futures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sf-stories in Nature, where a massive epidemic wiped out everybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without Tay Sachs-genes). 
</em><br>
<p>I suppose that if that future came to pass, then in fact people would
<br>
applaud that devotion to genetic diversity in the past.  However from
<br>
our present perspective we don't know that this will happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Taking risks is necessary, but taking unnecessary risks is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational. The same goes for genetic modifications; I really doubt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many parents would select highly risky treatments for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children-to-be. That is not really the issue here, but how to handle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fact that if parents select genes they might create initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions that are adverse to the person that later develops. Should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there exist some form of feedback or compensation system so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children can express their rights once they have become persons? It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not an issue of banning certain forms of radical changes, but rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making parents aware of the different potential costs of different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes. 
</em><br>
<p>What about a parent who takes his child into space on some kind of
<br>
irreversible journey (say, a traditional SF generation ship to the stars)?
<br>
Should children conceived on such a trip be able to sue their parents?
<br>
Should the children on the Mayflower have sued their parents for exposing
<br>
them to the hardships of the New World?  I don't think we can categorize
<br>
such journeys into necessary vs unnecessary risks.
