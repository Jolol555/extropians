<em>&gt; &gt;At the same time, people's lives are not so different from hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;years ago, except many more people have automobiles, high technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;appliances and devices, and medicine, as well as entertainment.
</em><br>
<p>I would agree that people's lives are not so different IN A FUNDAMENTAL
<br>
SENSE from hundreds of years ago. Fundamental problems remain the same and
<br>
fundamental patterns of solution also.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was wondering when would be a good idea to take a snapshot of published
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science fiction and science fiction from the Internet, and classify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything.  An ontology of all the various forms of speculative science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fiction, even space opera and fantasy, can be designed to some extent and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utilized.
</em><br>
<p>Now this is a beautiful idea. You may wish to look at
<br>
<a href="http://itsf.spaceart.net/">http://itsf.spaceart.net/</a>, a project run by Maison d' Ailleurs and the Ours
<br>
Foundation for the European Space Agency and aimed at extracting good ideas
<br>
from the SF literature. Since the sponsor is ESA this project is very much
<br>
focused on space, but could be extended or another project created.
<br>
<p>SF has descriptions of fundamental changes in lifestiles induced by
<br>
technology. Perhaps the most extreme example that I know of is Greg Egan's
<br>
book Diaspora which describes lives of future software entities in a
<br>
believable way.
