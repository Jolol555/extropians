<em>&gt;I though it was a good movie, I like most movies with Uma Thurman.  
</em><br>
<p>I disagreed profoundly with the scientific and political subtext--except in
<br>
so far as it was an allegory of the evils of racist discrimination (and
<br>
then it misfired because by hypothesis the gene-engineered *were*
<br>
physically and intellectual superior)--but then, of course, I don't much
<br>
like most movies with Uma Thurman.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It wasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessarily plausible.  For example, the swimming competitions and where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invalid brother saves his valid brother from drowning are symbolic. 
</em><br>
<p>Symbolic of *what*? At the end, this goose does the equivalent of Homer
<br>
Simpson plagiarizing his way into a job running a nuclear reactor. The
<br>
clear implication to me is that the space mission will be dangerously
<br>
compromised by his actions, just as badly as if someone with a major heart
<br>
condition joined a polar expedition, but hey, why should *he* be left out
<br>
of the fun? 
<br>
<p>The explanation offered in the swimming scene was that the unmodified bro
<br>
was able to match and even beat the phenotypically enhanced bro *because he
<br>
held nothing in reserve*. That is, he could swim farther out to sea in one
<br>
direction because his brother rather wimpishly planned to get back alive.
<br>
This stupid plan turned out to work because his superior brother
<br>
*unaccountably in terms of the agreed conditions* ran out of puff on the
<br>
extended outward journey (even though he still had nearly enough reserves
<br>
to get back to shore), and godhelpus was then towed in, coughing and
<br>
gasping and drowning, by the feeble brother, who presumably Used the Force.
<br>
Give me a break. A symbol has to be commensurate with the claim it's
<br>
allegorizing. GATTACA just denied without a blush the very claims it
<br>
established. 
<br>
<p>Now this is a worthy tactic if all such claims really are bogus. Fritz
<br>
Leiber published a very famous short story in the 1950s, `Poor Superman',
<br>
which took the piss nicely out of L. Ron Hubbard's absurd claims; Leiber's
<br>
sarcastic equivalent of a `clear' is palpably self-deceiving, like the
<br>
dupes who feed the Scientology coffers. But real gene engineering of the
<br>
GATTACA kind *won't* be bogus, even if Uma Thurman and Jeremy Rifkin tell
<br>
us otherwise. Its drastic improvements *won't* be amenable to being bested
<br>
by grit on the past of the old fashioned unmodified, any more than a guy
<br>
with a megaphone and all the determination in the world can better be heard
<br>
at cross-continental distances than one with a radio transmitter.
