<em>&gt;I don't recall seeing any comments over the summer on this article from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Scientific American claiming that a new drug (ALT-711) can restore
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elasticity to ageing tissue, thus improving cardiac function (demonstrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in mammals) and possibly providing other benefits as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Any comments?
</em><br>
<p><p>While I don't have any specific comments, other than ALT-711 and that 
<br>
entire family of new compounds (there are others being investigated by the 
<br>
same company) does look very promising and interesting in that it is 
<br>
exploring a new area of potentially useful pharmaceuticals.  Alteon (ALT), 
<br>
the company that developed the compound, recently completed  Phase IIa 
<br>
trials and while the official results aren't out yet, rumor has it (take it 
<br>
for what its worth) that they are looking good.  They just received $6-7M 
<br>
in funding to accelerate and expand trials of ALT-711.
<br>
<p>Of course, the only reason I know any of this is that I bought a bunch of 
<br>
their stock over a year ago at less than a dollar per share.  They were 
<br>
recently up in the $7-8 range, though they have followed the rest of the 
<br>
NASDAQ in the last month and dropped to around $4.  (Its been a tedious 
<br>
year, but my portfolio is still *way* up overall for the year).
