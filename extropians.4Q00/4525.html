I have a book written by a local, Daniel Doan, called 'Indian Stream
<br>
Republic' which I think you can get at amazon.com that covers the whole
<br>
history of the area. Its rather interesting. For example, the land was
<br>
originally deeded by the indian chief, King Phillip of the St. Francis
<br>
indians to a land development company in the late 1700's in exchange for
<br>
a kind of retirement pension for him and his wives. Several years later
<br>
a group of 9 indians from his tribe granted the same land to another
<br>
company, claiming that King Phillip had been expelled from the tribe at
<br>
Lake St. Francis and had no right to the land. At the same time, the
<br>
British governnor in Quebec had had a preliminary survey done of the
<br>
land for a border township, after the land had already been surveyed by
<br>
the first land company. After 15-20 years of wrangling between the two
<br>
companies, with competing and overlapping land grants to different
<br>
people, the two companies merged and all land claims were settled
<br>
(except so far as the British government was concerned). Sheriffs on
<br>
both sides of the border would pursue warrants for payments of debts
<br>
against people living in Indian Stream, with both sides claiming
<br>
jurisdiction of the territory. Finally the people got fed up and formed
<br>
an assembly, drafted and adopted a Constitution, and elected leaders
<br>
through several election cycles until one day a British judge issued a
<br>
warrant against a resident of Indian Stream for 'aiding and abetting'
<br>
the 'illegal' arrest of an Indian Stream resident who insisted he was
<br>
Canadian by a New Hampshire Sheriff. The canadians mounted a posse to
<br>
arrest the individual at his home, and brought him into Canada. The
<br>
residents then mounted a recovery posse that invaded canada, engaged a
<br>
firefight with the canadians, recovered their friend, and shot several
<br>
canadians. This sparked a calling up of militias on both sides of the
<br>
border and almost led to war between Britain and the US, but the British
<br>
finally caved in on the ongoing border dispute that stretched from the
<br>
coast of Maine, through Aroostook County, and across New Hampshire to
<br>
the point of latitude that defined the Vermont border on Hall's Stream,
<br>
which became the northwesternmost border of New Hampshire.
