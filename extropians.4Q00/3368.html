<p>I'm sorry, but I can't buy this as a generalization.  When I was in 
<br>
high school in rural Illinois, I saw local community members 
<br>
physically attack strangers because they were perceived to be gay, 
<br>
black, Mormons, atheists, communists, government agents, homeless or 
<br>
foreigners.  In my experience, many rural people are not very 
<br>
tolerant of those who are different.
