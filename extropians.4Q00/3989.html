JR sez:
<br>
<em>&gt;Good question. Also, how do we keep the idea of a transcendent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machine from becoming a religious meme?
</em><br>
<p>i would argue, no offense intended at all towards the singularity folks, 
<br>
that it already is a religious meme. singularity is supposed to solve every 
<br>
problem since the time you burnt your toast to cats and dogs living together 
<br>
in harmony, which smacks of faith to me.
<br>
<p>not that i think greater than human intelligence wont' solve problems we 
<br>
can't on our own, but perhaps the singularity will not be the incredible 
<br>
force you're expecting. what if self modifying humans with their patterned 
<br>
parallel processors are never overtaken by machine intelligences? it's just 
<br>
as likely as a human who is self modifying has less far to go to become more 
<br>
intelligent than a human, all he would have to do is become ANY smarter. a 
<br>
machine intelligence doesn't exist yet. going from 60 to 61 is easier than 0 
<br>
to 61, even with our design flaws.
<br>
just a theory.
<br>
<p>i do however, believe that expert systems and ultratech/ultrasoftware will 
<br>
play a role in improving us, as we're unlikely just to do it through 
<br>
biological manipulation(gene therapy, bioware, etc). although you could just 
<br>
add a bunch of grey matter and see what happened.
<br>
<p>(a wonderful quote from a bad movie:
<br>
&quot;....so, what does a 18 foot predator with a brain the size of a flat-head 
<br>
V12 engine think about?...&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Deep Blue Sea )
<br>
<p>the bottom line is that trancendant AI is cool, and massively 
<br>
useful(theoretically). but it's also not here. so we need to be careful 
<br>
where we put our trust(faith?). as long as we're not sitting on our butts 
<br>
waiting for momma AI to come and fix our problems, the religious nature of 
<br>
&quot;awaiting the singularity&quot; won't be an issue.
<br>
<p>my big question, is, when the singularity does occur, how do we keep people 
<br>
from treating it like a GOD, or a Demon. no matter how logical and well 
<br>
constructed it is, being treated like a god would hamper both it's 
<br>
situation, it's flexibility, and it's psychology(assuming a general 
<br>
intelligence would have a similar psychology to other general intelligences, 
<br>
such as humans, being given absolute worship and power has a tendency to 
<br>
mess with your head and hamper your effectiveness)
