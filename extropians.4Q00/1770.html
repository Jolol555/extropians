<p>Keep in mind that if you're going to carefully consider any argument
<br>
offered for government intervention you are going to be very busy for
<br>
many years to come, and you might as well become an economist :-).
<br>
<p>Also keep in mind that demonstration of a market failure is far from a
<br>
sufficient argument for government intervention.  On the margin governments
<br>
discourage, rather than encourage, people from investing in the future.
<br>
So the government failure in this area seems larger than any market
<br>
failure.  Which argues against empowering government to fix the problem.
