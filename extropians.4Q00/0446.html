in a universe like this, an exponential function cannot hold for

spacetime (we definitely do have a case of damaged goods here).

Huh?
<br>
<p><em> &gt; The moment when you've found a new consistency to the universe is not
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Funny, I disagree here. As soon as a theory has been established, duck
<br>
season is open. (Or maybe it's wabbit season).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; to look for explanations: either the old rule wasn't general enough or
</em><br>
<em> &gt; things have changed.  But a newly noticed consistency is something to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; take advantage of, not something you should expect to be violated now
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that you've noticed it.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, let's talk about Moore's law. Per se, it predicts only the amount
<br>
of devices you can put on an (affordable) die. Clearly, as structures
<br>
shrink by half, you can put four as many on the same surface. (The
<br>
same reason is making the hard drive storage grow larger in
<br>
exponential fashion). Simultaneously, the production costs of
<br>
semiconductors go up, unfortunately also in an exponential
<br>
fashion. Growing essentially defectless ton-weight monocrystals 300 mm
<br>
in diameter, monster optics for wafer steppers, even cleaner clean
<br>
rooms and even more complicated processes and testing devices
<br>
consisting of ten and hundreds millions of individual transistors
<br>
*are* costly.
<br>
<p>Integrated circuits are a new technology, about three decades
<br>
old. Because defect density limits good die yield and you cannot
<br>
shrink structures below size where quantum effects start to dominate,
<br>
Moore as we know it should run out of steam somewhere in ~2014, or so
<br>
(I don't have the actual number at hand). Maybe one can make quantum
<br>
devices with semiconductor photolitho methods, which would push the
<br>
envelope a little, but I doubt it. (There are architectural tricks,
<br>
allowing one eventually use the entire wafer (a single wafer costs a
<br>
few hundred bucks to process) surface as a &quot;good die&quot;, by shrinking
<br>
the system grain size and using defect-tolerant architectures, which
<br>
would do their own testing, etc. but this is outside of Moore's
<br>
scope).
<br>
<p>At this stage, you have to abandon a given technology altogether. If a
<br>
successor technology (molecular circuitry) is not ready to take over
<br>
at this point, Moore linear plot will have to level off. So the total
<br>
time span where Moore has been applicable will be less than half of a
<br>
century.
<br>
<p>I don't expect semiconductor photolitho devices to start failing Moore
<br>
now. I expect them to fail before 2020. So despite having a very nice
<br>
accurate law which has held for past three decades, the *more* &quot;reason
<br>
you have for believing you've found a phenomenon that should be
<br>
expected to expire&quot;. Because, uh, it can't last forever. Sustainable
<br>
linear log plot growth is incommensurable with the physics of this
<br>
universe, as we know it. This is the envelope law, not some growth of
<br>
a given technology for 50 years, or so.
<br>
<p>Surfaces of planets are finite, as the tolerable energy flux on their
<br>
surfaces. The number of atoms in a planet is finite. The energy output
<br>
of the sun is finite. The number of atoms in a solar system is
<br>
finite. The number of stars in a galaxy is finite. The numbers of
<br>
galaxies you can reach before the accelerating spacetime expansion
<br>
makes travel impossible is finite. The amount of matterenergy in a
<br>
given spacetime is probably finite.
<br>
<p>So, unless we have new physics eventually bailing us out, we're stuck
<br>
in an universe full of limitations.
