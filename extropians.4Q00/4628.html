I didn't read it as nostalgic for Woodstock so much as misty-eyed for a
<br>
world/society that could manage to support something as
<br>
idealistic/clueless/hopeful/non-feral as the guy shown in closeup whose
<br>
words Heston's character mouths in synchronism. If they'd had the
<br>
clearances, it could just have well been _It's a Wonderful Life_ or many
<br>
other Capra films. IMO.
<br>
<p>ObConfession: I really don't like _It's a Wonderful Life_ very much. I
<br>
wasn't exposed to it as a kid, so it doesn't get all the way through my
<br>
radar.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Omega Man&quot;:  Pretty good adventure SF film.  I get a kick out of the scene

<em>&gt; &gt; like 1976.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even funnier is watching Heston's character watch a documentary about
