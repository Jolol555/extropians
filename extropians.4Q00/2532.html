</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Though Max does occasionally tell me when I've been posting to frequently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think he and I agree that there is not only a non-trivial chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; apocalyptic disaster in the next century, (a possibility which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everyone became aware of around the time of the cold war,) but also a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chance of unprecedented wealth, longevity, and, dare I say it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happiness.  Neither of these possibilities is inevitable, though I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think they're quite likely outcomes of the next century or two.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By apocalypse, I was not referring to disaster, but to rapture.  Where is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all this wealth going to come from, with our resources destroyed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasteful behavior of the 20th century?  Where is this longevity going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come from, with our veins filled with carcinogens and our bodies bombarded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by radiation?  Where is this happiness going to come from, with our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spirituality destroyed by &quot;flatlander&quot; philosophers, our arts smashed by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media concerned only with profits, living in a world where we work from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sunup until sundown with no hope for another world hereafter?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, you really are a mess, aren't you? Resources do not get 'destroyed'. They 
<br>
just get reallocated. Every technological advancement allows the amount of 
<br>
resources needed to produce every dollar of economic activity to decrease all 
<br>
the time. Where do you think all the wealth of our economy comes from? It didn't 
<br>
just come from us trading iron and corn back and forth and paying a wage. 
<br>
Technology increases productivity, which decreases the amount of resources you 
<br>
need to live an ever higher standard of living. Get off the Malthusian BS, he 
<br>
was disproven long ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But it is in holding these beliefs *tentatively*, and in not allowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our beliefs to be determined by a leader or any other person, that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; demonstrate our rationality (in particular, our rejection of dogma).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We are not cultists or dogmatists of any other kind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rationalism is a dogma in of itself.
</em><br>
<p>No, its a process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't know much about Gnosticism.  I do know that typical Gnostics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have tended to prioritize the &quot;spiritual&quot; realm over the &quot;physical&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; realm.  I rather doubt most extropians would agree with that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but they were working from an ascending paradigm.  Extropianism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gnosticism reversed, the exact same stand within a descending paradigm.
</em><br>
<p>No, its an ascending paradigm based on factual data. I quite understand how you 
<br>
are so confused. Gnostics were living by the same sort of omen-ism as Harvey 
<br>
described was typical of ancient Hebrews, and other beleivers in gematria. If 
<br>
every group of sheep in a field stands for a number or prophesy as a concrete 
<br>
fact, it is easy to see how the gnostics would regard their 'knowledge' as being 
<br>
fact based rather than just theology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However, most Gnostics also hold that gnosis, a special kind of arcane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; knowledge, is what you need to survive apocalypse.  While I think most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of us agree that you can make yourself more powerful if you know more,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; knowledge by itself won't make you better off.  I rather doubt that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there will be a mystic quiz at the end of time; if anybody here DOES
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think that, I rather doubt they believe that this is view is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particularly relevant to extropy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, this is where you are incorrect.  Gnosticism isn't just about posessing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the knowledge- it's about using it.  Extropianism is about knowledge as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well, and the gaining of a form of arcane knowledge- Artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, nanotech, etc.
</em><br>
<p>This is quite so, but not dogmatically. If you know anything about the Gnostics, 
<br>
the main reason they were declared a heresy by Rome was their refusal to bow 
<br>
down to dogma. Refusal to accept dogma is not itself a dogma, something about 
<br>
which you seem to be confused.
