<em>&gt; You think wrong.  Yes, it does take *some* money to approve a craft for
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; just get some property sufficiently far from vulnerable stuff (say, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nice little corner of the desert - or, for low enough power tests, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large enough garage or warehouse) and do the test there, and the gov't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't care.  Heck, one group once did a rocket engine test *in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hotel conference room*; all they needed was permission from the hotel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; staff and local fire marshal, not exorbitant fees.  (They also needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previously and properly tested equipment; this &quot;test&quot; was more of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demo and PR stunt than an engineering test...except for the social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering, of course.)
</em><br>
<p>I pushed the button for one of those ballroom demos- yes, it *was* a
<br>
demo, but that engine was quite well wrung out at the time, over 300
<br>
runs and 25 minutes of operation.  We also routinely test LOX/alcohol
<br>
engines up to 400 lbs thrust in our parking lot, although we do try to
<br>
keep a fairly low profile.  Flight test will be right here in Mojave,
<br>
too.  It is possible to work within the system without too much pain.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now, once you're testing launches, the fees do go up.  But...say you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; testing a spaceplane: first tests are with it tethered to the ground,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then some free flight, then eventually (assuming you've got the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering right) you'll get approval for that craft model to fly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You may spend $millions over the entire development cycle, but most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely, less than $1 million of that will go directly to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government (at least, if one excepts income and sales taxes, and all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other fees and similar that apply equally to all businesses regardless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of industry, not just aerospace).
</em><br>
<p>This is generally correct- we have regular contact with the AST office
<br>
at the FAA (heck, Jeff is chairman of the RLV industry working group
<br>
that's giving feedback to the FAA), and while _certification_ for flying
<br>
passengers will be tough, permission for non-revenue flight test will be
<br>
pretty straightforward. Helping to write the rules for the certification
<br>
process does make life a lot easier. (Rocket aircraft are launch
<br>
vehicles under AST, not subject to regular FARs.  That's our story and
<br>
we're sticking to it :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And once you have a spaceplane that can legally take off and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land...well, filing a flight plan doesn't cost much.  Neither do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airport usage fees.  Your destination is orbital, and for that, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only additional requirement is that you merely have to *tell* US Space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Command (I think that's the agency's name) your intended orbit and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activities, though it is strongly advised that you be willing to adjust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you'd come too close to something else up there (avoidance of which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits you - as direct owner, if not pilot, of the craft which could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be destroyed by collision - much more than a large beauracracy which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could easily write off a few satellites if necessary).  It's not like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have legal authority to sell you authorization to exit US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airspace...and so long as you don't touch any other country's stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (*especially* their soil - no prob, if you're in orbit), normal &quot;just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made an excursion to international areas and coming back home&quot; laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply upon return.
</em><br>
<p>Perzackly, and even simpler for a suborbital flight, particularly if it
<br>
returns to the originating airfield.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; There may be many US gov't disincentives to private space, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excessive taxation and outright banning of private launches do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; count among them.  (Regulation, at the current level, is not outright
</em><br>
<em>&gt; banning since it is possible for a company with zero political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence to do a launch.)
</em><br>
<p>Having a good working relationship with the bureaucrats who would be in
<br>
deep hot water if you screw up badly, is a big plus.  Working up through
<br>
the layers, being polite and cooperative at every step, works wonders. 
<br>
Before we did that ballroom demo, we first invited the Mojave airport
<br>
fire department over to our hangar to see the engine run (they had a
<br>
blast, literally- the exhaust made a flag on their truck flutter).  They
<br>
gave a glowing (no pun intended) recommendation to the Kern county fire
<br>
marshall, who in turn gave us a letter to take to the Scottsdale fire
<br>
marshall.  We did a demo for them in their lunchroom, and they
<br>
cheerfully approved our waiver and sent one guy with a fire extinguisher
<br>
to watch the ballroom demo.  The day after, for our second public demo,
<br>
they didn't even bother with that.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I guess you could try launching from international waters but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then you would have several countries after you AFAIK.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I haven't seen any major country try to shoot down Sea Launch's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rockets, or even gripe that strongly about them.  Even if one grants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conspiracy theories about Boeing (SL's main backer) buying off the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gov't, Russia and China are a bit less susceptible to bribes by US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations.
</em><br>
<p>If you understand the bureaucrats' position, where approving _anything_
<br>
requires great courage (for they *will* be crucified in the press if a
<br>
licensee screws up) working with them isn't difficult.
