<p>Food? How very 20th century.
<br>
<p>A lot of people right now couldn't care less about agribots (hopefully, of
<br>
the gastrobot variety), they're having trouble keeping their rice bowls
<br>
full. To feed them on the short run does indeed currently require
<br>
pesticide use. (Yes, it takes toll on biodiversity, kills the soil, floods
<br>
the biosphere with nasty metabolites).
<br>
<p>We rich Westerners might see a brief period of advanced agricultural
<br>
automation, which is rapidly superseded by fully synthetic food production
<br>
and then no food production at all, when we leave biology behind. It is
<br>
interesting to see how salmonellosis and BSE pushes semisynthetic protein
<br>
foods forwards, I'd like to see the trend continue.
