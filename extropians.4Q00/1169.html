You know, I was thinking- it might be easier for the
<br>
brain to interpret signals from other brains than it
<br>
would for a computer to render it into some kind of
<br>
multimedia file and send it.  I imagine that looking
<br>
into dreams and other such fantastical experiences
<br>
might give us a starting point for where to hook up,
<br>
and tests with several subjects might be the sort of
<br>
thing one would have to conduct.  I'm wondering
<br>
whether or not this would be invasive sensory material
<br>
or passive- I hope the latter, like daydreaming or
<br>
imagining being fed back through into their sensory
<br>
regions, rather than the former, like driving through
<br>
traffic and suddenly &quot;seeing&quot; what someone else is
<br>
seeing.  
<br>
As to storage, everything in the brain is so massivly
<br>
amplified between it and the outside world, it might
<br>
be gigs of information for just short periods... quite
<br>
a lot of storage space'd be needed, unless of course
<br>
the storage space was, say, an additional, specialized
<br>
cortex.
<br>
I think building such a cortex would really be a step
<br>
in the right direction for neuroscientists, AI
<br>
researchers, and others who wanted to examine how the
<br>
brain works.
<br>
This all sounds somewhat subjective, in some respects,
<br>
and definitely sounds like you would need a lot of
<br>
volunteers, though I might be still thinking in an old
<br>
fashioned way in this age of computer simulations and
<br>
tissue cultures.
<br>
Think of it, a teenager, old-fashioned!  We are living
<br>
in interesting times.
