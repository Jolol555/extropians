From: &quot;CYMM&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:cymm@trinidad.net?Subject=Re:%20life%20extension%20question&In-Reply-To=&lt;09ef01c0311a$9fad0140$53243fce@m0w0m5&gt;">cymm@trinidad.net</a>&gt;&gt; I have done circa 800 cals day for
<br>
protracted periods... my genetic makeup
<br>
<em>&gt; seems to allow it...I felt fine - I wasn't particularly hungry because my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet was pretty filling.
</em><br>
<p>What were you eating? I do a lot of veggies, and I find that corn last's me
<br>
longer (as far as feeling full) thru the day, than my mixed veggies
<br>
alternative. (consisting of carrots, potato and celery) When I eat the
<br>
latter although it's lower calories, I'm hungry, sooner. I assume the corn
<br>
is more filling because it's starch/carb.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I supplemented heavily accross the vitamin spectrum - my weight went down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from 128 to 113lbs and stabilized there... I was about , oh, 47 then.
</em><br>
<p>I just take the standard &quot;one a day&quot;, this most likely is not efficient
<br>
enough for my low intake.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When I was, oh, 25 ish - I did a very, very low cal for months. I found
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; I slept a lot (12 - 18 hours a day...) but I never went into protein
</em><br>
energy
<br>
<em>&gt; malnutrition. This response may be genetic.
</em><br>
<p>No problems there, considering that I've always been on Hawaii time. I
<br>
always stay up late, and sleep late, my diet never seems to effect this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've had friends who have tried the same thing (...they're genetically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different and also have much higher body masses...) their hunger &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discomfort was excruciating.
</em><br>
<p>The pangs were more severe in the beginning. Now, my stomach has shurnk, and
<br>
I am also more used to it. (re-trained myself) I do get hungry, but not
<br>
excuriatingly so. I actually have my my first meal, a few hours after I wake
<br>
up. I just don't wake up hungry, it has to build. Then I eat some very
<br>
nanoscale snacks thru the day, to keep me going. &lt;One meal, and a couple
<br>
&quot;thingys&quot;. &gt; Of course this is not applicable when traveling.
