<p>
when is 'money' going to be correlated to amount of protons (other
<br>
important particle) transmuted?  that would be a great time. 
<br>
literally, monitoring all of them.

<em>&gt; &gt; I still think you're over-estimating the good being done by ExI

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         What might be a more realistic value then?  Sure, some $$$
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spent will be worth more than other $$$ spent on getting us to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity (and hence bringing immortal salvation to more), and given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time value of money, surely in general, $$$ spent now are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valuable than $$$ spent 10 or 20 years from now to the effort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bringing eternal salvation to more people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Surely, some amount of money spent today on Exi, medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research or whatever will more or less bring eternal salvation to one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more of our children.  Perhaps $0.01, or $1, or maybe $100?  Maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more for each immortal soul?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Lets say spending $10,000 on ExI, on average enables one more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our children to make it to eternal salvation.  Lets say spending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $10,000 on the Red Cross increases the average mortal life span of 100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people by 10 years (and lets assume this isn't, yet, enough to get any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them to the singularity.)  Would you consider these to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative numbers yet?  Even with this, which is the better buy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         I think I'd hope I'd be able to give up 10 years of my life if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it'd bring one more of my children eternal salvation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         I try to simply think, every $1 spent today might bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immortality to one more of my children.  Perhaps this is a little to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimistic, but by how much, do you think?  Even if it is, it still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helps me to overcome my selfishness and give a little more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         I kind of feel like the Mormon church which tries to justify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their lack of aid to humanity, given the billions of $$$ they take in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every year.  They just built a billion $$$ conference center in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downtown SLC which is the largest (and likely the most expensive)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious building of it's type anywhere.  They claim: why help a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person live a few more years of life, when you might be able to give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them eternal salvation by converting them and getting them baptized?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But then, this justification works for me and not for them, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm right and their wrong right?;) If extropians are right, how many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people could the LDS church really bring eternal salvation to, given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such huge amount of resources, if they only really knew which was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better buy????
