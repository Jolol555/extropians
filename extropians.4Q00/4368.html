a

<p>If the views on technological progress you've read about in Kurzweil's books 
<br>
and others are right, there will be interesting and challenging work in a 
<br>
broad range of career fields.  One thing you ought to think about doing is 
<br>
separating as much as possible personal feelings of impatience from the 
<br>
process of making core career decisions.  Most rewarding careers require a 
<br>
long period of study and apprenticeship - at least they seem long when viewed 
<br>
from the perspective of someone in their undergraduate years :-)  Instead, it 
<br>
seems you should engage in a course of honest self-assessment of what you're 
<br>
really good at and what you really enjoy doing.  
<br>
<p>This is not as easy to do as it might seem and requires both time and the 
<br>
courage to engage in a broad range of study and action to build up the base 
<br>
of knowledge and experience upon which you can make good decisions.  As I 
<br>
wrote here recently in response to a similar question, I'd advise that you 
<br>
shouldn't feel compelled to make career choices too soon in your life.  Our 
<br>
society can grant a lot of leeway to young people to experiment with 
<br>
different lifestyles and career paths.  Unless your aptitudes and goals seem 
<br>
extremely clear to you right now (a rare thing for someone at your stage of 
<br>
life, I think), give yourself permission to try new things and spend as much 
<br>
as many months working at something tentatively, i.e. without full commitment 
<br>
and without sacrificing your options to &quot;back out&quot; and start again.
<br>
<p>The more I'm called on to do career and life counseling for young people 
<br>
(which I find I do a lot of these days), the more I think that humans in 
<br>
their late teens and early twenties may have some hard-wired compulsion to 
<br>
make a commitment to a particular life-path.  In the broad sweep of 
<br>
humanity's evolutionary history, such a behavioral mode would have had great 
<br>
survival value for the individuals that possessed it: It would have helped 
<br>
usher individuals from their early &quot;learning&quot; years and out of the protective 
<br>
cocoon of the birth family into the necessity for mating outside their 
<br>
lineage and establishing a secure foundation for their offspring.   But that 
<br>
behavioral compulsion may be counterproductive in an increasingly complex and 
<br>
technological world, where gathering a much broader base of knowledge and 
<br>
experience is more valuable than would have been so for our simple 
<br>
hunter-gatherer ancestors.
<br>
<p>So perhaps the best thing to do is to resist the urge to make an irrevocable 
<br>
commitment at this stage and stay flexible.  Make a commitment instead to 
<br>
building as broad a base of knowledge and experience as you can, building 
<br>
skills that give you an adaptive advantage in highly fluid and variable 
<br>
contexts.
