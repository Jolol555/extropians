Luke mentioned to me that he thought this topic would have
<br>
drawn more discussion, I replied to him offlist.  My
<br>
comments to him are included here for posterity... with some
<br>
additional thoughts at the end.
<br>
<p>================================================================
<br>
It is fine, I suspect the reason it didn't get discussed much is
<br>
that it has been discussed before.  We don't have a really good
<br>
answer for the &quot;killing copies (or the original)&quot; ethics problem.
<br>
<p>I believe in one of the &quot;Physics of Star Trek&quot; books discusses
<br>
the problem of &quot;transporters&quot; and concluded &quot;can't be done&quot;.
<br>
The problem is that the type, location, bonding, etc. of every
<br>
atom in the body is a very large amount of information.
<br>
The topic came up over a lunch table at the Foresight Conf. in November.
<br>
While I was dubious about transporters, Ralph Merkle argued that
<br>
it wasn't really a problem with enough compression.  I had already
<br>
concluded when reading the Star Trek analysis, that with the proper
<br>
compression (based on knowing the human genome, the polymorphisms
<br>
in an individual has, etc.) that it might be feasible.  Ralph argued
<br>
that it certainly was, but I'm unconvinced yet, as the non-redundant
<br>
data in the brain alone is not small and it isn't clear how much
<br>
you can compress it without losing something important.
<br>
<p>Then even if the &quot;transporter&quot; problem is solvable, you have to address
<br>
the energy loss over interstellar distances.  Unless you have solar system
<br>
or larger sized receivers on the far end it is going to be a very big
<br>
waste of power (due to all those photons that miss the receiver as the
<br>
beam spreads out).  I think you *really* need to sit and do some very
<br>
complete &quot;cost-of-transmission&quot; analysis.  I've thought about doing
<br>
a paper on it, but unfortunately it isn't high on my list.
<br>
<p>Because of the compression required, you probably only get transporters
<br>
that &quot;must&quot; function in biohazard filter mode (i.e. you get back the
<br>
person, but lose anything considered hazardous).  Now, you will get
<br>
into an interesting situation for someone infected with say the
<br>
prion protein because if they believe &quot;who they are&quot; is a &quot;prion
<br>
infected person&quot;, then they may want the biohazards transmitted
<br>
as well.  Transmission of the extra information (to reanimate you
<br>
as a precise mental replicat of yourself who you *really* are) is going to cost

<br>
I believe, that Moravec's &quot;Harvard Doesn't Believe in Science
<br>
Fiction&quot; piece has some useful commentary on the &quot;conscious
<br>
selves&quot; vs.  &quot;instantiations&quot; perception problem.  Its here:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Computing/Moravec-H/HDPSF.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Computing/Moravec-H/HDPSF.html</a>
<br>
I'm not sure whether the copy with shutdown followed by the reanimation
<br>
of the original with &quot;pasted&quot; experiential difference information
<br>
solves the ethical problem.  It could be argued since you have
<br>
become a 2nd individual (on an alternate time line), that pasting
<br>
the new memories back onto first constitutes murder.  You can
<br>
argue that is feasible *if* you argue that the body in stasis
<br>
is the property of your mind (even though your mind may be in
<br>
another body someplace else or circulating bits in a Matrioshka
<br>
Brain).  Thus far Greg hasn't let me successfully argue that
<br>
bodies or bodies + minds are the property of other minds
<br>
because doing so opens the Pandora's box that higher level
<br>
entities can treat you as a disposable diaper.  Which is
<br>
pretty much how God treats us now, so perhaps it is nothing
<br>
more than a continuation of the current reality...
<br>
=======================================================================
<br>
<p>I believe that the energy losses due to the fact that any
<br>
transmission beam will spread out over the long interstellar
<br>
distances is one reason Robert Freitas thinks probes are the way
<br>
to transmit information.  Now, if Spike would just finish
<br>
his interstellar dust ablation calculations we would know
<br>
how much matter gets lost due to &quot;rampaging&quot; space dust.
<br>
Then we might be able to finally solve the radio/optical SETI
<br>
vs. probe debate.  Using E = mc^2, we could figure out whether
<br>
the lost photons or the eroded shields is really more valuable!
<br>
Since faster probes are going to cost more due to the
<br>
expense of accelerating them to higher velocities
<br>
(and they are going to erode faster, meaning you need
<br>
a larger shield), I suspect you can come up with a very
<br>
exact equation saying when you transport by photons and
<br>
when you transport by matter.  Then you have to apply
<br>
a discount function to that because the photon transmitted
<br>
information is always going to arrive earler.
