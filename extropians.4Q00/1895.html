</em><br>
<p>Although this is a complication (especially if there was a change in zoning that
<br>
made the bar unexpected to the condo owner), I still think the answer holds from
<br>
all perspectives. Regardless of the particular cost-benefit analysis for this
<br>
action (petitioning to close the bar), the full cost includes granting
<br>
legitimacy to the government and allowing the precedent that reacting to a
<br>
petition of this sort is an action within its purview. Now, as a radical
<br>
libertarian, I don't think this is a legitimate action, so I'd like people not
<br>
to encourage the government thinking it is legitimate.
<br>
<p>Do I think that someone other than me who owned the condo would think this way?
<br>
No, probably not. I don't think my view of the government or my view of strategy
<br>
in dealing with the government is terribly widespread. I think the likely action
<br>
by the condo owner is to petition. But if I were the condo owner, I'd seek a
<br>
non-governmental solution or suck it up and live with the noise.
<br>
<p>As we don't live in a fully police state, the operations of government are
<br>
dependent on social support; they need the sanction of the people to law claim
<br>
to legitimacy. And I don't mean that in a philosophical social contract sort of
<br>
way; I mean in a riot in the street, bloody revolution sort of way. If one is
<br>
against government (which one should be as government rather the dangerous
<br>
institution), then you should minimize your sanction of it and go around it as
<br>
often as practical/possible. The will of the people is not primarily expressed
<br>
in voting, but in everyday uses of government and taking the legitimacy of
<br>
government for granted. It is this legitimacy that must be challenged.
<br>
<p>&lt;/rant&gt;
<br>
<p>Peace-
<br>
