</em><br>
<p>Is it the rising cost of living, or your rising standard of living that's
<br>
affecting your savings rate?

<p><em>&gt; I gre up rural - I know how to take care of things like animals and plants, and

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But in the end it comes down to the tyrany of money.
</em><br>
<p>Money, as Joseph Campbell said, is congealed energy. The energy you expend
<br>
on the job comes back to you in the form of money, which can be traded for
<br>
pretty much anything--a property that's not true of your energy. So the
<br>
purpose of the day job is to provide you with sufficient money to procure
<br>
everything you need and want. Of course, some of that money goes to
<br>
&quot;overhead&quot;, stuff you need in order to keep your job. I don't see what's so
<br>
tyrannical about that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no place I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can live without either the fear of imminent confiscation by the latest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; banana republic despot in the name of &quot;land reform&quot;, or the need to have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of steady income to pay the various property taxes.  
</em><br>
<p>That's true today, but I don't think it has to be that way everywhere,
<br>
forever.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So here is the conundrum.  The land that is inexpensive enough to afford is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too far from the places I am capable of finding work (did I mention I'm a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widely-read, hopefully well-spoken high school grad?  No college diploma
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, unfortunately - and that cuts my options down even more), and the land
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close enough to be able to work reasonably is very expensive now, especially 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for what would be needed for this sort of subsistence,
</em><br>
<p>OK, so you have to find a new line of work (different job, part-time
<br>
student, etc.), a new way of working (e.g. telecommuting), or a new
<br>
location...or you can whine about how life isn't fair. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and at the same time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's also prone to the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; property tax progression - one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farmer sells out to a developer for 50 units, and they agree to add $5000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per acre in property taxes for new schools - after all, they're only paying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $500-$1250 at best for their share, but the farmer next door just got tagged 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for $500,000 more per year, and is forced to sell to a developer, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes on and on.
</em><br>
<p>In most places, agricultural land isn't taxed at the same rate as
<br>
residential. And some states are playing games with development rights to
<br>
preserve farmland. But it's inevitable that land near population centers
<br>
will be worth more for residential use than for agricultural use.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; And my work does very little toward allowing me to pursue the things I hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most dear - because I have to spend so much o my time dealing with traffic, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and working most of my waking hours to pay for the house I don't really want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the gas I would like to not have to use to get to and from a job that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't really line up with my personal interests.  But it's the trap of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moneyed system.
</em><br>
<p>But it's a trap you have the power to get yourself out of--if not to avoid
<br>
in the first place, which is much easier.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, I understand a true libertarian society would have a different set of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems, and I could find a place where I wouldn't have to pay property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxes - but if you can show me a true libertarian nation I could move to...
</em><br>
<p>Somehow I don't think that merely eliminating property taxes will solve all
<br>
your problems.
