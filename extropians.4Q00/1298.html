<p><em> &gt; I think Robin is referring here not to raw materials, but to processed
</em><br>
<em> &gt; materials ready to be turned into finished product.  This feeds into
</em><br>
<p>Then the &quot;growing&quot; rate refers to how long it takes to turn all
<br>
locally available matter into life. While this might enrichen and
<br>
separate elements, it would not actually be wise for an unauthorized
<br>
seed to enter such a system (these maser and laser beams are pretty
<br>
bright). Plus, even stealthy pioneer seeds would not have much chance
<br>
in a mature ecology.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; the question of how quickly the replicators could build new seeds and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; launchers.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; My feeling is that once the wave has passed you by, evolution is through
</em><br>
<em> &gt; with you.  All the factors that got you here are irrelevant now.
</em><br>
<p>No, the evolution is still pretty much active. Only the fitness
<br>
function has changed: you don't get benefit for running anymore. Now
<br>
the question is whether you now 1) metamorphize into sedentary
<br>
phenotype (I agree with you that there there is not much need for a
<br>
pioneer to carry such genotype) 2) adapt rapidly to changed conditions
<br>
3) failing that, get overwhelmed by slower but fitter successor wave
<br>
organisms (that wave did come from somewhere, after all).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; It is very analogous to an organism which has lived past the age at
</em><br>
<em> &gt; which it can reproduce.  Selection pressures no longer act to keep such
</em><br>
<em> &gt; organisms alive, for exactly the same reason.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Why? The critters are still alive. They can still replicate, and
<br>
they'll run into limited resources. Using our infinite agar plate
<br>
metaphor, assume slowly growing agar (continuation of life-supporting
<br>
conditions). After the wave front specialists have passed, the medium
<br>
is left colonized. Now you will to start adapting to sedentary
<br>
conditions, evolve into grass, sheep, wolves, people with guns and
<br>
whatever evolution nonlinearities will come up with.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; In other words, if the fastest way to expand is to build fast in some
</em><br>
<em> &gt; kind of catastrohic mode which will kill the organisms which stay behind,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that is what will evolve (eventually).  If the fastest way to expand
</em><br>
<em> &gt; happens to leave organisms behind, then that is instead what will evolve.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I don't see the logic behind such reasoning, and I don't see instances 
<br>
of such behaviour in terran ecology. Pioneer organisms are always
<br>
displaced by successors, not due to apoptosis. Suicide at cell and
<br>
individuum level is rare, and never total.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Selection/evolution plays no part in determining the fate of colonies
</em><br>
<em> &gt; which have fallen behind the wave.  Their behavior is unselected-for.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; There is no selection pressure to favor colonies which hold onto the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; systems after launching seeds (once the frontier has become unreachable).
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
No. There is no selection pressure to continue launching the seeds,
<br>
because the wave front has passed. Now launching the seeds reduces
<br>
your fitness, since removing resources from growth and competition.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt; Staying is default. The launchers can't launch themselves, so they
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; stay. Sustainable barrage of stellar neighbours with seeds is a waste
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; of resources after they're infected, so they'll cease.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The behavior of the launchers after the frontier has become unreachable
</em><br>
<em> &gt; has no effect on the rate of spread of the frontier, hence this kind of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; reasoning cannot play a role in the selection of the fastest-spreading
</em><br>
<em> &gt; replicators.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Sure, but I never claimed it did. I'm describing the behaviour of
<br>
post-wave organisms who adapt to a changed fitness function. This does
<br>
not impact the wave front organisms.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; Sterility is a possibility, but many other behaviors are possible as well.
</em><br>
<p>Expecting sterile substrate (or even sterile organisms) in wave's wake
<br>
is utterly unreasonable. Life just doesn't do such things.
