<em>&gt; Hey Doug, Im glad you weighed in on this one.  Every time I look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the Osprey I think how cool it would be if that concept could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be made to work.  Since you are aerodynamics cluey, help me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out here.  It always looked to me like if the pilot rotates the props
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to horizontal with too much forward speed they would lose lift
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the craft could go auger helplessly into the ground with both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engines screaming.  Wouldn't ya have flow separations all over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the place?  So then there would be a craft that could only be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operated safely by computer, eh?
</em><br>
<p>Doing a transition at high speed is probably not recommended by the
<br>
manufacturer, but I doubt that the consequences are so drastic.  The
<br>
retreating blades might stall, but the wings would still support the
<br>
aircraft while airspeed would bleed off quickly.  The vibration would be
<br>
hard on the aircraft and pax, though.
<br>
<p>The problem in the Marine crash earlier this year was vortex ring
<br>
interaction- any helicopter can get sucked in by this, when the descent
<br>
rate is the same as the downwash velocity and circulation closes.  You
<br>
lose lift and plummet, also called settling under power.  Dual rotor
<br>
helicopters tend to have this happen to only one rotor at a time, so
<br>
tandem rotors birds pitch up or down violently, and side-by-side
<br>
vehicles roll over.  This is followed by a very bad day and funerals.
<br>
<p>The most recent crash may have been a simple CFIT error- controlled
<br>
flight into terrain.  Night nap of the earth flying is not forgiving...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I thought of a maneuver that might make it safer to land, altho
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it might not be so comfortable to the passengers:  as the pilot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approaches the landing, she would pull it up vertical and hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it until the upward velocity reached zero, with the nose straight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up.  Then keeping the props horizontal, the pilot rotates the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuselage to horizontal, and gradually settles to the deck, thereby
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoiding the risk of what has evidently crunched two ospreys:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lost lift because of rotating with too much forward velocity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wouldnt that work?  spike
</em><br>
<p>No need- the usual transition is done after slowing to a speed where the
<br>
wings can still support the aircraft, and the rotors can also.  Why add
<br>
drama if the transition can be done simply?
<br>
<p>Sure, the V-22 does have some advantages over convntional helicopters-
<br>
but the operability and price are not worth it.
