<p><em> &gt; By changing &quot;planets&quot; to &quot;solar systems&quot; and we [humans] to we (Earthlings
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and Martians), we find again that our observations are biased: we apparently
</em><br>
<em> &gt; aren't able to make predictions about life appearing in other solar systems
</em><br>
<em> &gt; (under the AP.)  This will continue ad infinitum-- while tremendously
</em><br>
<em> &gt; rewarding to hard science, the observation of additional intelligences adds
</em><br>
<em> &gt; no further information under the AP.
</em><br>
<p>This is highly unreasonable. Why do you see the gained information in
<br>
purely boolean terms? Don't you see that the bias decreases?
<br>
<p>The second blip in the same stellar system still gives you valuable
<br>
information: because only spores of primitive organisms can be
<br>
crosstransferred by impact ejecta, hence creating a sporadic, low
<br>
payload coupling. The development of higher life and especially
<br>
intelligent life would be independent until they develop means of
<br>
communication and travelling. It also tells you something about the
<br>
extension of the life belt.
<br>
<p>A blip from one of the neighbour stellar systems must indicate that
<br>
life nucleation event was independent. This way you know that
<br>
essentially any stellar system will do. The farther away the blip, the
<br>
higher the probability that it shares the same magical local
<br>
environment as us.
<br>
<p>A blip from one of the neighbour galaxies tells you that essentially
<br>
any will do. There might be events energetic enough to sterilize
<br>
clusters of galaxies, but we don't see them. A second blip from that
<br>
remote a distance carries as much information payload as a second blip
<br>
ever could. It is a very, very good 24ct Au-plated Bvlgari blip.
<br>
<p>Of course, the more blips you have, the more information. The step
<br>
from one blip (just you) to the second (preferably from afar) is very
<br>
large, the other ones decrease logarithmically. If you have 100 blips
<br>
already, one extra conveys almost no additional information.
