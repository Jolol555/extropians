<p><p><em>&gt;        The first thing that &quot;happened&quot; was nothing -- that is, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  couldn't even get any confirmation that my membership fee had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  actually reached the ExI.  Eventually I started sending emails to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  people whose address was on the Extropy site, asking if they had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  received the money.  Still nothing.  No reply.  After half a year
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of sending emails to people who according to the Extropy site were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  representatives of the ExI, I finally received confirmation that my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  money had indeed arrived, and that I was registered as a member.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  That was all.  Then nothing again.
</em><br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a similar experience.  But instead of complaining like
<br>
this, I realized that there simply wasn't enough people working for
<br>
this good cause and pursued and tried to find ways which I could help.
<br>
I finally was persistent enough to get involved and have become the
<br>
exi web administrator.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are lots of people who talk the talk in this group, but
<br>
it is very difficult to find people willing to actually do some work to
<br>
make things perform better.  Max can't do it all alone.  Great
<br>
movements like this aren't supposed to serve the people as they sit
<br>
back and complain, the people are supposed to serve, &quot;put their
<br>
shoulder to the wheel&quot; and help make things better for all, don't you
<br>
think?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure many people can find problems with the extropy web
<br>
sight too.  I could sure use some help with a few things.  Again, just
<br>
a few people can't do it all alone.  If your willing to help, rather
<br>
than complain, we can certainly put you to work, helping to make
<br>
things better.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would you (or anyone?) like to do some database entry work
<br>
for the sight?  (If so, please contact me) Or maybe there are some
<br>
other areas you'd like to help with?  The few of us that are at least
<br>
doing some work could sure use some help with all there is to do to
<br>
make things work the way they should and eventually will.
