<em>&gt; I can't follow your argument.  Yes of course our preferences evolved to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; changing our actions, relative to those we prefer, would make us less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adaptive if we were still in our ancestors' environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But you seem to accept that our environment has changed greatly since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our preferences evolved.
</em><br>
<p>I think it has, although I don't know what the detailed impact of these
<br>
changes would be.  But I don't see where in the paper this fact arises.
<br>
Wouldn't the authors' reasoning apply just as well if the environment
<br>
hadn't changed?  So what is the relevance of this change?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And the paper isn't about what is adaptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway - it is about what would satisfy the preferences we have, however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we got them and however adaptive they are.
</em><br>
<p>But isn't it relevant that changing society's discount rates may be
<br>
harmful?  Or is that simply off topic for this paper?
<br>
<p>What if someone wrote a paper proposing to change prices.  Let's lower
<br>
the price of gasoline to 10 cents a gallon.  That would improve social
<br>
welfare because there are more consumers than producers.  Is it reasonable
<br>
to neglect the impact of that change on the supply of gasoline, and to
<br>
look only at how this satisfies our preferences?
