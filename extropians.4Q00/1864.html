Robin writes, quoting Hal:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Isn't it possible that the society which results from making all these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;changes, even though they are intended to satisfy people's preferences,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is one in which people are less happy than they would have been without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As Nick emphasized, standard policy analysis isn't about what makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people happy, its about giving people what they want.  And the fact is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that people don't just want to be happy.  They are willing to give up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness to get other things.
</em><br>
<p>I meant to be using &quot;happy&quot; as synonymous with &quot;having preferences
<br>
satisified&quot; or &quot;maximizing utility&quot;.  Let me try to boil it down to just
<br>
a couple of sentences, which summarize the argument I have been trying
<br>
to make.
<br>
<p>Making changes to discount rates is motivated by satisfying people's
<br>
preferences.  However, making this change will have side effects.
<br>
This could lead to people having fewer of their preferences satisfied.
<br>
<p>Does that make sense?
<br>
<p>Hal
