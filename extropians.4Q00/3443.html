And then there's all the people who got into computers because of Ted
<br>
Nelson's Computer Lib/Dream Machines. I was trying to get the Xanadu
<br>
insiders tuned into this weird &quot;SGML&quot; stuff back in '87.
<br>
<p>Of course, the later catchphrase from Ted is that the Web was what we
<br>
were trying to _prevent_, and to some extent he's right--but that's
<br>
another story. :)
