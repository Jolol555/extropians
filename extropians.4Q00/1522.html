</em><br>
<em>&gt; nope, actually, even then.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does this mean that there is necessarily intelligent life elsewhere in the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; this mean that there is necessarily more than two intelligences in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe?  No.  It doesn't.  It is an observation that gives us insight into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what's going on 'out there' and leads us to make predictive statements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Theory my man, theory.  Assumptions in the face of limited knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>All I think you can say from this is, if the universe is infinite in
<br>
spatial extent, roughly homogeneous (about the same everywhere), and
<br>
without special long-distance forces to prevent it from happening, then
<br>
the existence of intelligent life here on earth implies that intelligent
<br>
life will appear elsewhere.  Furthermore, there will be an infinite
<br>
number of planets where intelligent life exits.
<br>
<p>You can go beyond this and say that not only intelligent life will exist,
<br>
but life like our own.  In fact, humans genetically identical to ourselves
<br>
will exist somewhere, in an infinite number of places.  And in fact,
<br>
beings identical to ourselves, to you and me, exist an infinite number
<br>
of times in the infinite universe, thinking our own thoughts, plus all
<br>
possible variations on them.
<br>
<p>However, in a finite universe, a single observation does not give you
<br>
grounds to make these predictions, or to assign a probability to them.
<br>
To do that, we need a theory which tells us how likely the evolution of
<br>
intelligence is.  And unfortunately at present our observations do not
<br>
allow us to narrow the range of possibilities enough to give a meaningful
<br>
answer to the question.
<br>
<p>I believe that in the next 100-200 years (year-2000 years, that is, not
<br>
super-advanced, futuristic years), we will be able to get answers to these
<br>
questions by running simulations and experiments which will shed more
<br>
light on how easy it is for life, for complexity, and for intelligence
<br>
to evolve.  We may also get better models for solar system evolution
<br>
which will help us to pin down the likelihood of earth-like planets.
<br>
All this will give us a more sound basis for predicting the frequency
<br>
of intelligent life in the universe.
<br>
<p>But until then, a single observation that intelligent life exists does
<br>
not really shed light on the probability that other such life exists.
