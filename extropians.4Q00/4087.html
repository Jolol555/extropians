<br>
<p>&quot;Extended Life-Span Conferred by Cotransporter Gene Mutations

<br>
<p>Abstract:
<br>
&quot;Aging is genetically determined and environmentally modulated. In a study
<br>
&nbsp;of longevity in the adult fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we found
<br>
&nbsp;that five independent P-element insertional mutations in a single gene
<br>
&nbsp;resulted in a near doubling of the average adult life-span without a
<br>
&nbsp;decline in fertility or physical activity.  Sequence analysis revealed
<br>
&nbsp;that the product of this gene, named Indy (for I'm not dead yet), is
<br>
&nbsp;most closely related to a mammalian sodium dicarboxylate cotransporter--a
<br>
&nbsp;membrane protein that transports Krebs cycle intermediates. Indy was most
<br>
&nbsp;abundantly expressed in the fat body, midgut, and oenocytes: the principal
<br>
&nbsp;sites of intermediary metabolism in the fly. Excision of the P element
<br>
&nbsp;resulted in a reversion to normal life-span.  These mutations may create
<br>
&nbsp;a metabolic state that mimics caloric restriction, which has been shown
<br>
&nbsp;to extend life-span.&quot;
<br>
<p>The mean lifespan extensions were from 37 to 70 days (47% increase) and
<br>
the maximum lifespans were increased from 79 to 100 days (22% increase).

<br>
<p>Best excerpt:
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I was finding it extremely irritating,&quot; Dr. Helfand said. &quot;We had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  already pretty much prepared our paper and we just needed to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  when these flies were going to die. They kept living on and on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  At some point, it occurred to us that maybe something is happening
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  here that we should be paying attention to.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>Duuhhh....
<br>
<p>In all likelyhood (as the extensive commentary by researchers shows),
<br>
this may be a critical insight into one of the key mechanisms by
<br>
which caloric restriction acts to extend lifespan (essentially
<br>
this is a genetic mutation that &quot;starves&quot; cells).  The article
<br>
seems to indicate however that further mutations in this direction
<br>
do not provide additional benefits (i.e. more starvation decreases
<br>
longevity).  Nor is it clear whether mammals would benefit to
<br>
the same degree from similar mutations or genetic pathway
<br>
manipulations (bear in mind that there is a lot of evolutionary
<br>
pressure for Drosophila to live fast and die young, we may
<br>
already be living &quot;slower&quot;).
<br>
<p>Judy Campisi's comments (in the NY Times article), that this
<br>
may provide a path for caloric-restriction mimicing drugs is
<br>
open to question, for if you block the transporter with a drug
<br>
(the most likely first strike at this), the cells, esp. neurons
<br>
are still going to &quot;feel&quot; like they aren't being fed...  You
<br>
probably need a two drug approach, one to block the transporter
<br>
so the cells are calorie restricted and another to convince
<br>
your neurons that, yes, you really have just had the most filling
<br>
meal in your life...
<br>
<p>As a side note, I'll point out to those experimentalists among us
<br>
(should I name names, no, I think not, for they are the unsung
<br>
heros and I acknowledge them for their dedication) -- now that a
<br>
strain of flies exists with an extremely extended longevity, what
<br>
will be required is insights into what extends the longevity of a
<br>
strain with already extended longevity (ah yes, we must tighten
<br>
down the thumb screws while we drip water slowly onto the end of
<br>
your nose...)  Conquering aging is going to be succession of efforts
<br>
figuring out the next part of the genetic program that is broken.
<br>
<p>I will comment in a highly unusual (for me), &quot;The glass is half-empty&quot;
<br>
tone, by pointing out that -- THE FLIES STILL DIED!  But if you are a
<br>
&quot;the glass is half-full&quot; type, then this is indeed very good news
<br>
as it gives a key molecular insight into a huge body of knowledge.
<br>
We now have a very big lever and a place to stand.  :-)
