The problem is where to move to. There is no book I know which list
<br>
extropian/libertarian, low tax, good climate, good medical care, and an
<br>
intellectual climate areas of the world. 
<br>
<p>Amsterdam perhaps but the tax rate would kill me.
<br>
<p>Also, since I am gay, homophobia in many areas of the world (and the US) is
<br>
a problem. 
<br>

Insisting on

<em>&gt;A community is not an asset that belongs to you, and if its tyrannical, it must
