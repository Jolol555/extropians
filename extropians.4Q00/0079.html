EUGENE quoting CYMM wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But suppose the machine evolves ten billion times faster - suppose the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutation rate is ten billion times that of a human - the boundary
</em><br>
conditions
<br>
<em>&gt; might preclude the darwinian selection that allows for concomitant
</em><br>
coupling
<br>
<em>&gt; of the two species' evolution.
</em><br>
<p>EUGENE SAID: Huh? Both systems still evolve. (Of course, you have to have a
<br>
population, not a single individuum for it to happen). They still
<br>
couple, by virtue of occupying the same timespace. Of course, because
<br>
their fitness is not equal, one of the players is going to bite the
<br>
dust.
<br>
<p>CYMM SAID: Eugene, I was commenting on the likelihood, a la Barbara, that
<br>
there could be &quot;cooperative co-evolution&quot;. If we create an appropriate
<br>
&quot;response function&quot; for each evolving species; then we'll have to have some
<br>
coherence for non game theoretic cooperation to occur... this is so, BTW,
<br>
even if the response function is a quantum state vector - it's the case in
<br>
ferromagnetism; BCS superconductivity etc.
<br>
<p>I do agree with you, of course,  that coevolution will always occur once two
<br>
species share the same environment. But Barbara was talking cooperative
<br>
co-evolution.
<br>
<p>EUGENE SAID: &quot;...Radiating species attempt to fill all available niches.
<br>
Even if one
<br>
class of niches is way cushier, they're expanding as a random cloud in
<br>
the genotype/phenotype space, and hence will eventually fill them all.
<br>
<p>CYMM SAYS: The keyword is &quot;available&quot;. If a peak in the fitness landscape is
<br>
already occupied... it often does not pay to try to take it (...in a
<br>
radiation scenario with depauperate biota..) there are so many other peaks
<br>
nearby. It is only when the holder of the peak is (comparatively) very pooly
<br>
adapted would a conquest occur.  It's an annealing scenario.
<br>
<p>Look at freshwater cichlids (...fishes...) in Central America... they
<br>
certainly had one heckuva time in the freshwater environment...but their
<br>
evolutionary forays into the mangrove estuarine &amp; reef environments were
<br>
nowhere as successful - because of the presence of centropomids and
<br>
lutjanids in the estuaries... and the pomacentrids on the reefs.  But there
<br>
was nothing else that stopped them... they were physiologically preadapted
<br>
to take such niches (... a few species have made tentative forays into such
<br>
niches - but it always pays to differentiate away...).
<br>
<p>What I sincerely hope is that when the inevitable foray into exponential or
<br>
hyperbolic expansion of &quot;intelligence&quot; occurs - that the available
<br>
technology allows a lightning fast evolution... Methinks that a relatively
<br>
slow and protacted evolution in the early stages of such AI will put human
<br>
civilization at serious risk.
