<em>&gt; Nowthen, suppose we go ahead and accept things the way

</em><br>
<em>&gt; either the Democrat or the Republican.  I dont know the exact
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Republican:  45%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democrat:  46%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Green:  2%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarian:  2%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undecided:  5%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If this is the case, then obviously this election is going to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cliffhanger,
</em><br>
<p>You really have to look at it state-by-state, though. It's the electoral
<br>
breakdown that matters, not the popular vote.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and the outcome is important as all hell,
</em><br>
<p>Is it? Sure, given the choice between Gore and Bush I'd rather see Bush
<br>
elected. But they're idealogically so close that I don't think it matters
<br>
much which is elected. And who knows...if Gore is elected and goes overboard
<br>
his liberal agenda it could cause a swing back toward smaller, less
<br>
intrusive government. Or maybe not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; so then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose further that:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  You decide you will donate 500 bucks to some political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; party and 20 hours of your time campaigning for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  That you are a Libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is the most logical thing to do?  Vote Republican, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *second* choice, and donate your money and time to...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the GREEN PARTY!  Your last choice!  The Eco-nazis!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reasoning:  since the news media is covering everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said and done by the Rs and Ds, your paltry 500 bucks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 20 hours would sway perhaps 10 votes.  However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you donate and campaign to one of the &quot;miscellaneous&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parties, you will sway perhaps 100 votes with the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; donation and effort.  The 100 votes you win for the eco-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nazis would be mostly at the expense of your third choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dems, whereas if you donated and campaigned for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarians, the 100 votes you would sway would come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the expense of your second choice Republicans!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, Mike, you are absolutely right, dammit.  {8-[  The logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing for a pragmatic Green to do is to vote Democrat and campaign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for and donate to Browne, while the most logical thing for a pragmatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarian to do is to vote Republican and donate to Darth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nader.  Libertarians for eco-totalitarianism.  Greens for Browne.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ill be damned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What am I missing?  spike
</em><br>
<p>You're missing the long view. Despite the fairly close polls at this time,
<br>
the election will probably be another electoral landslide. Your 100 votes
<br>
subtracted from Gore still won't have any effect on the outcome of the
<br>
election, even multiplied by hundreds if you could convince others to do the
<br>
same thing. So while this strategy maximizes your effect on the coming
<br>
election, its not going to be enough.
<br>
<p>So we should be looking at the next election, the one after that, or the one
<br>
after that. We should be growing the Libertarian Party. First we want to get
<br>
it to the point that most people are aware of it--enough that LP candidates
<br>
will get press commensurate with their poll numbers. Next, maybe the LP
<br>
presidential candidate draws enough votes to have changed the outcome of the
<br>
election. At that point, Demos and Repubs will start adopting Libertarian
<br>
ideas to draw Libertarian voters, and even without a Libertarian President
<br>
we'll start to see some Libertarian initiatives. Eventually, a Libertarian
<br>
candidate will be a serious contender and the duopoly will be a thing of the
<br>
past.
<br>
<p>You're also missing the fact that it's morally reprehensible to support your
<br>
enemies. If every Libertarian did as you suggest, the Greens would get a
<br>
huge boost and the LP would be seriously set back.
<br>
<p>The best way to support the LP is to support the LP. Vote LP. Donate to the
<br>
LP and the LP candidates. Don't play games trying to maximize your impact
<br>
that could backfire.
<br>
<p>-Dave
