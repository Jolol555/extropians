Subject: Re: Majors was: Nanotech
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Overall, I would recommend Philosophy as a minor to go along with another
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; subject, or do it as a double major, like Dan. Philosophy and Computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Science or Philosophy and Biomedical Engineering look like great choices.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;That sounds like good advice for Nicq and Zeb and Dan. Those who want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;build a Spiritual Machine (or who aspire to converge with artilects) might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like to include Zen Buddhism and Robotics in their studies.
</em><br>
<p>Philosophy can be a nice, cushy option as a student ... we had our (few)
<br>
tutorials in the Union bar. It is open to bullshit, unlike more rigorous
<br>
disciplines .... so if you enjoy drinking and talking cack, philosophy
<br>
might be for you. If you want to be taken seriously in the world of work
<br>
then engineering, electronics .. or almost anything else is preferable.
<br>
<p>I have always found science courses much better organised, and
<br>
with much more valuable content. I have succeeded in getting my
<br>
philosophy encyclopedia &amp; library as a set text for A-level over here
<br>
in the UK, but it actually contains more information than most philosophy
<br>
1st degree courses ..... so what is the point of spending three years of
<br>
your life when all the philosophy you probably are going to need can be
<br>
gotten much easier and cheaper? I don't think studying philosophy tells
<br>
you how to live your life either ..... there are some good texts like King
<br>
Asoka,
<br>
but these all pre-date academic philosophy. Lingoistic analysis doesn't add
<br>
anything much to wisdom texts! The good stuff probably isn't on the
<br>
University syllabus anyway. Quinn, Davidson, modern philosophers ...
<br>
instantly
<br>
forgettable lightweights on the whole, and their debates sterile and
<br>
circular.
<br>
<p>I am designing a &quot;conscious&quot; machine based on MVT, but my neural
<br>
computing training and computer science is much more useful than much
<br>
from Philosophy .... but sure, read Copi's book on formal logic and
<br>
something
<br>
on inductive logic just to cover your bases.
<br>
<p>Seasons greetings
