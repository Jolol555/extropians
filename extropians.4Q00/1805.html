Hi Eliezer,
<br>
<p>Loved your singularity essays.
<br>

<p><em>&gt;Well, you made a good case for self-defense.  What are the other fourteen?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(I'm not requesting a series of fourteen posts, I just want the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;list off the top of your head.)
</em><br>
<p>1.  Good values, beliefs and attitudes for life extension.
<br>
2.  Planning and analysis (skills and application)
<br>
3.  Managing your psychology and brain chemistry
<br>
4.  Anti-aging therapies
<br>
5.  Practicing good general health measures
<br>
6.  Accident prevention and preparation
<br>
7.  Financial resources and well being
<br>
8.  Medical care
<br>
9.  Violence avoidance, protection, self-defense
<br>
10. Bio-preservation
<br>
11. Building social relationships
<br>
12. Relationships to social hierarchies
<br>
13. Keeping up on science and technology
<br>
15. Longer term concerns (future technology, politics, environment, space,
<br>
etc.)
<br>
16. Mental skills
<br>
17. People skills
<br>
<p>Each item has many subheadings.  They are roughly in the order I
<br>
think it makes sense for the typical person (in a developed country)
<br>
to pursue them.  One could pursue them in something like an iterative
<br>
cascade.  It could be argued that the ones at the bottom are the most
<br>
important but they are also the most difficult.  A dozen or two other
<br>
people who have been into life extension for a while looked over the
<br>
list and most had a similar order. They are all pretty important.
<br>
<p>This list is from an individual perspective.  I started this list
<br>
after hearing Romana's talk at Extro I.  I finished a working
<br>
version of it a few years ago.  What I am working on now is a web
<br>
site that looks at personal and group life extension concerns and
<br>
projects.  I hope to have it up some time next month.  I am well
<br>
into a second draft.  I want to get my main ideas and concerns in
<br>
one place as a jumping off point for discussion and collaborative
<br>
projects.  It looks like there are some other similar projects so
<br>
once I get my second draft done I will start surfing around.
<br>
<p>Once I get my site up and poke around some I'll come back here and
<br>
try to generate discussion on particular topics.
<br>
<p>Russell once argued that item 9 (self-defense) belonged higher on
<br>
the list.  I say two black belts.  A half dozen firearms.  A dozen
<br>
courses at someplace like Front Sight.  Good mental and emotional
<br>
self control.  Study violent behavior and situations.  Test and
<br>
maintain all of these skills and I think that is about all it deserves
<br>
unless you actually expect trouble.  You can keep getting better
<br>
after that but at a more leisurely pace.
<br>
<p>I'll second Russell's recommendation to check out Dale Seago or Mike
<br>
Kelly for anyone in the bay area.  I'm not an expert on martial arts
<br>
but I looked at about 30 schools before I settled on trying Bujinkan
<br>
first (well, 3rd or 4th, but first this time around.)  Russell is
<br>
getting pretty kick ass guys and gals we should try to catch up.
<br>
<p>The politics of self-defense and freedom is one of the things that
<br>
contends for first place when I start thinking about group concerns.
<br>
It's not that I necessarily think it is urgent or important but rather
<br>
that I do not know enough to evaluate the risk.  Until I get a handle
<br>
on violence and oppression on a societal and political level I will
<br>
keep it high on my list of concerns.  Some other top concerns on a
<br>
group level are aging, technology (AI, nanotech, biotech), wars.
<br>
<p>What I find most challenging now is the allocation of limited resources.
<br>
A 48 hour day and I would be good to go.  My primary solution to that
<br>
(besides giving up melancholy) is to seek more collaboration and discussion.
<br>
I have mostly worked alone (with occasional exposure to the brilliance
<br>
of my Extropian friends).  That's about all I want to say tonight other
<br>
than that I am sexually/romantically available and at least a little cute.
<br>
<p>Lunch anybody?
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Will
