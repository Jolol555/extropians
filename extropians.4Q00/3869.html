</em><br>
<p>Amazon also lists your reviews as being &quot;from Sioux Falls, SD&quot;, by the
<br>
way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps your way (write your whole life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story, all your interests, etc.) is better than letting people pick things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up piecemeal...
</em><br>
<p>It works out the same way, in the end, doesn't it?  The strength of your
<br>
net.presence doesn't determine how much people know about you; it just
<br>
determines what level of net.adept is required to know it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, I had pretty much figured it out by now.
</em><br>
<p>Pity.  I guess there's no point now in implementing the rest of my master
<br>
plan.
<br>
<p>Your birthday is also listed in the #babygoth data, by the way, and one of
<br>
the neqroteqh email addresses was used by an &quot;Anton MacDonald&quot; for some
<br>
posts.  (I'd actually managed to miss your earlier post in which you'd
<br>
explained that &quot;nicq&quot; was short for &quot;Nicholas&quot;.)
<br>
<p>Just making your life a little more surreal.
<br>
<p>I have a couple of other comments on things you said or thought at some
<br>
point during your entire lifespan:  There is a difference between
<br>
rationality and rationalization.  There are people who can &quot;prove anything
<br>
with logic&quot;, who use their intelligence simply for justifying what they
<br>
already want to believe, but this itself is not an intelligent act, at
<br>
least not if done deliberately.  Those who fail to understand this are the
<br>
script kiddies of rationality.  You have not achieved proficiency in logic
<br>
until logic can tell you something you didn't expect to hear - until logic
<br>
is dictating to you, and not the other way around.  I judge moral
<br>
philosophies the same way; you have not achieved proficiency in morality
<br>
until your philosophy takes over and tells you something you don't want to
<br>
hear.  Of course, that doesn't mean that just telling you *anything*
<br>
unpleasant means you're doing things right... but if all you hear is what
<br>
you want to hear, you'll never get anywhere.  (Judging proficiency in
<br>
logic is rather easier; logical reasoning has to tell you something that
<br>
you didn't start out expecting, and then the logic also has to be right.) 
<br>
One of the reasons I don't like magic-based philosophies, and
<br>
nihilism-based moralities, is that they appear to have no capability to be
<br>
used in a way that surprises the user.  Personally, in addition to the
<br>
Nicolai Kingsley stories, I think you should also read &quot;The Moral
<br>
Animal&quot;.  (You can skip &quot;Engines of Creation&quot;, since you've read that
<br>
already.  Sorry!  Just backsliding for a moment.)  At least some of the
<br>
better magical philosophies prescribe mental training, awareness of
<br>
awareness and the like - and I know you believe that's what's important,
<br>
not the rituals - which tune abilities that can sometimes be turned to far
<br>
more powerful disciplines, such as evolutionary-psychology-augmented
<br>
self-awareness.  But I advise you to start soon, since you're running out
<br>
of time.
