Hi Extropians,
<br>
<p>Nicq MacDonald wrote most of the following:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;A backup would just be a copy- your consciousness would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone forever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Could you define &quot;consciousness&quot; for us in the sense of describing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what you would have lost by being restored from a backup?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The awareness of my self from a subjective point of view- my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A backup would only be a copy of me.  To an external observer, it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identical, and to it, it would be consciously aware as myself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be me.  I would be gone, my conscious with me.
</em><br>
<p>There is only ever one of a specific entity (due to the nature of reality).
<br>
What is important is the aim of the backup - to provide a good continutation
<br>
of you; your values and beliefs, your physical presence, your wifes husband,
<br>
your families son, your workmates colleague.  Any copy worth its salt will
<br>
do all that; and think it is you as well; there is no point nitpicking about
<br>
whether it really is you or not, if is a satisfactory continuation of you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; See the recent movie &quot;The Sixth Day&quot;.  I can't remember the name of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; character at the moment, but near the end of the movie, when he clones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; himself while he's dying, he realizes that the new self is not him, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely a copy, and he's toast.  This is precisely what I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about- a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy is not the original.  The original, &quot;I&quot;, is what I'm concerned about-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the data that is flying about, or the matter it's made up of.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, 'you' might die - but at least you will be able to leave a person
<br>
behind who thinks he is you and will be able to continue lifes journey,
<br>
lifes struggle, or lifes party on the beach for you (depending on your
<br>
outlook).  Its better than nothing, right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Since we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still don't understand the nature of the &quot;I&quot;, we're a million miles from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truly duplicating it.
</em><br>
<p>I can't read Hungarian, but I could duplicate it with a photocopier.  Maybe
<br>
we don't understand the nature of consciousness yet, but if it follows
<br>
ordinary reality/physical laws, all evidence points to us being able to
<br>
duplicate it.
<br>
