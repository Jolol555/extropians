<p>&lt;&lt; Sure but dont worry about culture shocking Zubrin.  Hes been an
<br>
&nbsp;out-there kinda guy for so long and people are always taking pot
<br>
&nbsp;shots at him.  Hes developed a rugged suit of armor.  {8^D
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Actually, when you read what Zubrin is proposing, for instance in
<br>
&nbsp;his Case for Mars, he really *isnt* that far out there.  He isnt proposing
<br>
&nbsp;any technology that has not already been developed.  His message
<br>
&nbsp;is no fantasy, it is more a straightforward LETS DO IT, lets get it
<br>
&nbsp;done, we can, lets GO.  Love that kinda talk.  spike &gt;&gt;
<br>
The fellow is definitely a sharp cookie, especially since I believe he came 
<br>
up with the concept of a magsail, what professor Winglee at U of Washington 
<br>
is currently trying to develop for NASA, before Winglee. His Magsail would 
<br>
slow down a fast starship by slamming into the magnetic field of a 
<br>
neighboring solar system, so as to not spend 1/2 the loaded fuel, slowing 
<br>
down in order to orbit. Zubrin also stated some years back that the Magsail 
<br>
would be great for solar system crusing.
<br>
<p>I also wonder if some others you may have connections with might be 
<br>
&quot;invitable&quot;?  Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, Clifford Pickover, etc.??? (pant
