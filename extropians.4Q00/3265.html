<p><em>&gt; I saw a documentary on PBS about the Amish. They don't let their kids go

<p>Now this stuff is suprisingly sticky.  If we say that the Amish are
<br>
obviously harming their kids with such practices and that we should use
<br>
state power to liberate them or to force them to let them (the kids) go
<br>
to school longer, then we have established in principle that the state
<br>
gets to control how we and our children are educated.  We establish that
<br>
the state is the guardian rather than parents.  This is not a happy
<br>
conclusion.  
<br>
<p>To be born under such circumstances in such a family is unfortunate. 
<br>
But direct intervention of any kind would be worse.  The first plays out
<br>
the consequences of one's stupidity in the lives of your children.  The
<br>
other sells all of our children to the state.
