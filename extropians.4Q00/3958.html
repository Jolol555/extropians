</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, I think the resolution is that the slogan is short for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;*private* property is theft&quot;, and it envisions the existence of public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; property.  Hence theft is perfectly possible, and private property is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theft from the public.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; However, as my later comments state, if it is the public's chosen agent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e. government) which sells/rents/leases that property to individuals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; it is not theft, since the public is getting freely exchanged value for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that property which it wishes to sell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To be clear, I am not arguing that property is theft.  Rather, I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; arguing against the position advanced by Samantha and supported by Mike,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the slogan is self-contradictory and meaningless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is. It makes no delineation between public and private property.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since the person who came up with it, Bakunin, was an anarchist, his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position was that land is ownerless in its raw state, but he was not so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pedantic about it as, say, a Georgist. He was not for the confiscation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the product of one's labor either. His quote got distorted by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statist communists and socialists who despised him so thoroughly.
</em><br>
<p>I must correct myself here. It was Proudhon who said &quot;property is
<br>
theft&quot;. I was reading his bio last night. His definition of property was
<br>
pretty strict, i.e. assets accrued by individuals derived from the
<br>
productive surplus of past generations, i.e. an industrial/scientific
<br>
base, that was beyond that necessary for the productivity of those
<br>
individuals. He saw the 'debt to society' that we all owe is that part
<br>
of our income derived from our productivity above and beyond what we
<br>
could have produced in a primitive state of nature, and the education to
<br>
provide the skills necessary to attain that productivity is the source
<br>
of this, an education from a knowledge base produced by all of humanity
<br>
that came before us. As such, he was most certainly not a Georgist, nor
<br>
did he agree with the meanings that Marx, Engels, and others would
<br>
ascribe to his aphorism in the future.
<br>
<p>Where he may be wrong in his aphorism is as follows:
<br>
<p>a) if information is free (as many current day socialists would claim),
<br>
then there is no debt to society that needs to be paid forward.
<br>
b) If the assets of the industrial and scientific base are created by
<br>
individuals, then they are paid, as individuals, during their lifetimes,
<br>
whereupon their property derived from their work ends up either in their
<br>
estates or else in the public domain. If we are dealing with
<br>
intellectual property, then its ownership expires in prescribed time
<br>
periods and no further debt to its creator is owed. If we are talking
<br>
industrial assets, those are owned by corporations or individuals, and
<br>
they derive income from their use consistent with the market demand for
<br>
their use. Society, or rather, the state, produces nothing, owns
<br>
nothing, and only exists as an instrument of force to confiscate the
<br>
product of productive individuals for the benefit of those who do not
<br>
produce.
