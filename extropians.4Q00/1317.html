<p>Actually, it works really well. PDF drivers (printer drivers that put out PDF)
<br>
actually produce larger files than going by the distiller route, in many cases.
<br>
Producing postscript first, then distilling with the parameters set as you want
<br>
them, is in my experience a faster and more compact way to go. Of course, if you
<br>
leave the PS files lying around they will take up disk space, but there is
<br>
really no need to do that. For example, I produce a 1800 page software manual in
<br>
hardcopy, PDF, and HTML. Greyscale at 600 dpi, with thousands of graphics. The
<br>
source file in Ventura is 24 megs, the post script file runs about 92 megs,
<br>
while the distilled PDF is abour 9 megs, and the HTML version runs about 15 megs
<br>
(graphics included). What is great about the PDF file is that the ventura
<br>
generated tables of contents and indices (you can do multiple) are used to
<br>
generate bookmarks in the PDF, not only creating links on every TOC and index
<br>
entry on the pages themselves, but the collapsible bookmark tree is generated
<br>
that can appear on the left side of the window. (For you scientific types,
<br>
Ventura also has a really great equation editor). I publish the HTML and PDF
<br>
versions on the same CD-ROM, and I use Acrobat to also create a search engine
<br>
index for the Acro Reader search features. Datamann customers have found that
<br>
the PDF version is the easiest to use and search. The one thing I don't like
<br>
about Ventura's publish to HTML feature is that when you publish an entire
<br>
publication, it creates ONE HTML file for every chapter, rather than divvying up
<br>
page by page or section by section, so some pages can wind up being pretty
<br>
large, causing long load times.
