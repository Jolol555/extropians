<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a draft.  Please do not cite it or quote from it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;4400 words.
<br>
<p><p>There can be no doubting that advanced information technologies
<br>
will bring large-scale social change.  The technology is advancing
<br>
at an extraordinary rate in quantitative terms, and it will probably
<br>
continue to improve by a factor of 100 each decade.  Sheer computing
<br>
power and communications bandwidth will be abundant.  The hard
<br>
question is what direction the consequent social changes will take.
<br>
The technology is not only increasingly powerful but highly malleable.
<br>
Its qualitative architecture is capable of evolving in many different
<br>
directions, depending on who can assemble the resources to build
<br>
it and secure the cooperation of others to use it.  And that
<br>
is a political and economic question, as much as it is technical.
<br>
Social institutions will shape the technology, even as the technology
<br>
provides raw material for the reshaping of institutions.
<br>
<p>Every new technology creates a vacuum of imagination, and the
<br>
imagination of the West takes definite forms.  One of these forms of
<br>
imagination begins with a dualism between the corrupt world of the
<br>
flesh and the purity of the spirit.  In the Internet world this form
<br>
of imagination gives us cyberspace, the technological equivalent
<br>
of heaven, the purely abstract space-apart that is constructed from
<br>
the mathematical ideals of computing.  The virtual reality fad of
<br>
the early 1990s was one version of cyberspace, and another is the
<br>
concept of an online community.  Of course, Western imagination is
<br>
not all wrong, and there do exist virtual reality technologies and
<br>
online communities.  Nonetheless, experience is making clear that
<br>
the idea of cyberspace is misleading, and that the uses of advanced
<br>
information technologies do not constitute a space apart from ordinary
<br>
reality.  Quite the contrary, for most purposes advanced information
<br>
technologies are deeply bound up with the rest of the world.  Virtual
<br>
reality is simply one end of a spectrum of applications, each of
<br>
which embeds networked hardware and software into the world in a
<br>
different way.  It is the great philosophical virtue of ubiquitous
<br>
computing technologies and spontaneous wireless networking protocols
<br>
like Bluetooth to make this clear, and to help tear down the ancient
<br>
mind/body divisions that have long narrowed our conceptions of
<br>
computing and of ourselves.
<br>
<p>Notions of online community are equally misleading.  People do
<br>
form social bonds through new digital media.  But communities are
<br>
analytically prior to the particular technologies that their members
<br>
use.  The worldwide community of stamp collectors, for example,
<br>
existed long before the Internet, and it conducts its collective
<br>
life through many media besides the Internet.  Its members even meet
<br>
face-to-face.  The same goes for the thousands of other communities
<br>
of shared interest -- professions, associations, extended families,
<br>
political parties, and so on.  Use of the Internet might change the
<br>
dynamics of these communities, and many striking stories of community
<br>
change have been recorded.  But Internet use is embedded in something
<br>
larger.  Even communities that form online often develop other means
<br>
of interaction, for example by holding caucuses at conferences.  In
<br>
each case, the notion of cyberspace limits our vision by directing our
<br>
attention to a small corner of a large phenomenon: the interaction and
<br>
coevolution between new technologies and the institutional orders and
<br>
ways of life in which they are embedded.
<br>
<p>Although the imaginative structures of cyberspace descend from a
<br>
long philosophical tradition, their recent history is explained just
<br>
as much by political economy.  Simply put, cyberspace is a lobbying
<br>
campaign.  The notion that the computer industry seeks to avoid
<br>
regulations and other government involvement is scarcely credible,
<br>
given the large number of laws that it has successfully supported
<br>
throughout the world.  Government interference through draconian
<br>
intellectual property laws is an example.  Nonetheless, many other
<br>
lobbying campaigns do draw on the imagery of cyberspace as a new and
<br>
separate world, completely different in its workings from the old
<br>
world of smokestacks and railroads, a kind of fragile spaceship that
<br>
democracy could only harm.
<br>
<p>Yet at the same time, cyberspace has been imagined as a force that
<br>
will bring about the perfection of the market that government is said
<br>
to obstruct.  By removing friction from the market mechanism, it is
<br>
said, networking information technology will bring about something
<br>
resembling the utopia of Adam Smith: an efficient market consisting
<br>
of large numbers of producers and large numbers of consumers, none
<br>
of whom possesses the kinds of economic or political power that we
<br>
associate with the industrial era.  This second form of imagination,
<br>
it should be noted, is wholly incompatible with the first.
<br>
Information is no longer expected to stand apart from the material
<br>
world, but quite the contrary is expected to descend upon the world
<br>
and reorder it according to another vision of heaven, this one derived
<br>
from the dynamic, self-ordering equilibria of 19th century physics
<br>
(Mirowski 1989).
<br>
<p>Despite the surface contradiction, the underlying pattern is clear
<br>
enough: information, it is said, will impose its own order on our
<br>
lives, which will henceforth participate in its transcendental purity.
<br>
I propose to take seriously this idea of an order of information.
<br>
If we are to take seriously the interaction of information technology
<br>
and market economics, what order *will* the Internet be imposing on
<br>
the world?  It is a partial and loaded question, of course.  It is
<br>
altogether unclear that the world's people wish to have any such
<br>
order imposed on them, and it is equally unclear that such an order
<br>
could actually be imposed in practice.  Nonetheless, technology and
<br>
ideology alike are exercises in applied imagination, and precisely
<br>
because imagination is a material force in the world it will be a
<br>
useful exercise to recover the order of information that emerges from
<br>
information technology and markets as they are practiced.
<br>
<p>As a window onto the way that business imagines the Web, let us
<br>
consider the projects reported in a 9/18/00 Business Week supplement
<br>
on 50 companies that the magazine's editors regard as &quot;Web smart&quot;.
<br>
All of these companies are using Web-based technologies to improve
<br>
their operations.  Some companies are using the Web to exchange order
<br>
information with customers and suppliers.  Others are using this
<br>
same information to predict shortages or other market conditions, or
<br>
to accelerate product cycles.  A university is tracking its clinical
<br>
trials.  One group of manufacturers is sharing unused space their
<br>
trucks; another manufacturer is gathering data from all the machines
<br>
in its factory and making that data available to all of the machines'
<br>
operators, for example so that bad product batches can be detected
<br>
more quickly.  With only a few exceptions, all of these projects can
<br>
be described as instances of two overlapping visions, which might be
<br>
summarized as follows:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Digital shadows (Agre 1994, Clarke 1994).  Make the whole
<br>
object continuously and interactively accessible to everyone who has
<br>
a relationship with it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Centers of calculation (Latour 1987).  Make a whole population
<br>
of objects likewise accessible to everyone.  Continuously perform
<br>
calculations on this population of objects -- scheduling, market-making,
<br>
mapping, forecasting, cash flow, aggregate outcome measurement, data
<br>
mining, etc.  Make the results of these calculations interactively
<br>
available to everyone who can use them, and accelerate action cycles
<br>
accordingly.
<br>
<p>These prescriptions require a little explanation.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;* &quot;Object&quot; here does not mean object-oriented programming, or
<br>
physical object, or the pejorative sense of treating someone as an
<br>
object, although any combination of those things might be present.
<br>
Rather, it means that a person or thing is treated under some
<br>
professioanl framing -- treating a person as either a student or a
<br>
patient, for example -- and that the unit of analysis is the person
<br>
or think together with digital representations and data about it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;* It is the &quot;whole&quot; object in that *all* such representations and
<br>
data are made available for every important attribute of it.  This can
<br>
mean that digital &quot;roots&quot; have been grown into it -- a truck engine
<br>
or factory machine, for example -- to record its operating parameters.
<br>
It can also mean maintaining a history of it, for example the history
<br>
of changes to an airplane or transactions on an account.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;* &quot;Accessible&quot; means that this data is available on the Web,
<br>
wirelessly or wireline, real time, all the time.  It means tracking
<br>
the object physically and/or bureaucratically.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;* &quot;Interactively&quot; means that everyone with the appropriate authority
<br>
can change or control the object remotely, either its virtual side
<br>
or its physical side or both, depending on what makes sense for a
<br>
given application.  When the object is a person, the interaction can
<br>
mean reaching &quot;through&quot; the virtual side and getting a synchronous
<br>
connection to the person, for example customer service, a particular
<br>
person who signed some information in a knowledge base, or a large
<br>
number of people who might be assembled on a distance basis for a
<br>
training course.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;* &quot;Everyone&quot; can include the object's owner (monitoring one's car
<br>
at a distance), the manufacturer (appliances &quot;phoning home&quot; for
<br>
preventing maintenance or restock), or an employer (checking in on
<br>
expenses incurred by drivers on the road).
<br>
<p>It remains to be seen, of course, which of these projects ever gets
<br>
working, and which ones prove to be worth the trouble.  Business
<br>
Week's own evidence is sometimes equivocal, and its upbeat summaries
<br>
surely gloss over a world of hidden agendas and messy details.  None
<br>
of the projects, moreover, reaches the full generality of the two
<br>
models that I sketched.  Nonetheless, a clear picture does emerge of
<br>
the deep structure of a business vision of information technology, one
<br>
that grows naturally from the project of rational ordering and control
<br>
that has informed business computing practice from the start.  It is a
<br>
version of what David Gelernter (1991) calls the mirror world: making
<br>
the whole world digitally available at every point in the world.  This
<br>
is the promise and illusion of Web search engines.
<br>
<p>But the business vision is actually more specific than the mirror
<br>
world, and more suggestive, in its emphasis on the relationships
<br>
that structure computing links.  A family's relationship to its
<br>
refrigerator, a manufacturer's relationship to each of the cars
<br>
it has made, an investment firm's relationship to its clients --
<br>
each of these relationships has an institutional and informational
<br>
architecture that can be inscribed in the architecture of the data
<br>
links that join the two sides.  By complicating the architecture of
<br>
the data links, one can provide additional functionalities or increase
<br>
the efficiency of existing ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the point of view of the individual, or of the artifact or
</em><br>
organization, the change is striking.  Relationships that may formerly
<br>
have been episodic, their participants interacting only when jointly
<br>
present or when talking on the phone, or through the arm's length of
<br>
paper records that might not be up to date, are now to be continuous,
<br>
always-on, 24/7.  We should not conceive the change as discontinuous,
<br>
much less as a rewriting of an underlying institutional logic.
<br>
Nonetheless, the development of a portfolio of always-on relationships
<br>
-- to people, organizations, and things -- does call us to revisit
<br>
traditional conceptions of the person.  No longer, for example, are
<br>
particular relationships tied to particular places.  Rather, everyone
<br>
is tied to everyone else all the time.  All of our potentially
<br>
thousands of relationships compete for attention through wireless
<br>
devices whose interfaces -- not based on the obtrusive ringing of a
<br>
telephone, one supposes -- are as yet hardly imagined.
<br>
<p>Central to such a world are institutions and technologies that
<br>
might be called switchboards: the practical means by which people
<br>
establish, maintain, and evolve relationships.  These might be
<br>
market relationships of whatever structure, longer-term contractual
<br>
relationships, professional ties, family relations, shared memberships
<br>
in associations, and many others.  Lower-level switchboards might
<br>
have functionality no more complex than an Internet router or mailer,
<br>
while more complex switchboards might layer on the functionalities
<br>
of a marketplace, library, event notification, gaming environments,
<br>
workflow tools, supply chain integration, geographic information and
<br>
tracking, or many others.  The architecture of these switchboards is
<br>
obviously a matter of some concern from a legal and moral standpoint,
<br>
as well as economic and technical.
<br>
<p>Identifying the technical basis for the maintenance of relationships,
<br>
however, does not tell us the form that the resulting network of
<br>
relationships will take.  For that purpose, it will help to return to
<br>
the second of the two business visions of cyberspace that I sketched
<br>
at the opening: the friction-free electronic economy that will deliver
<br>
us to the idealized market of Adam Smith.  Let us leave aside the
<br>
question of whether such an outcome would be desirable, and instead
<br>
ask whether will actually happen.  The argument for it is clear
<br>
enough.  It is based on Ronald Coase's (1937) epochal paper &quot;The
<br>
Nature of the Firm&quot;, which introduced the concept (though not the
<br>
phrase) of transaction costs.  Coase asked, given that Adam Smith's
<br>
market of individual artisans and consumers is the economically
<br>
optimal way to organize the economy, why do firms exist, much
<br>
less large corporations?  What is the economic reason for these
<br>
often-substantial islands of centralized command and control?  The
<br>
answer, Coase suggests, is that the market mechanism itself entails
<br>
costs.  Buyer and seller must seek one another out, establish the
<br>
quality of the goods, negotiate, handle money, monitor one another
<br>
for honest performance of the deal, and perhaps even litigate about
<br>
it afterwards.  All of these activities are costly, and Coase argues
<br>
that a transaction will be organized within the boundaries of a
<br>
firm if it can thereby be done more cheaply than it could on the
<br>
open market.  This is likely to happen, for example, when two parties
<br>
are likely to do a steady stream of business whose nature is hard to
<br>
specify in advance, so that it is worth creating a stable relationship
<br>
of employer and employee between them.  The parties still incur
<br>
organizing costs, but these might be less than the transaction costs
<br>
that they would incur on the market.
<br>
<p>Coase's argument, then, lays the boundaries of firms around those
<br>
regions of the economic landscape that are more efficiently organized
<br>
that way.  It is crucial that Coase's argument depends on the
<br>
relative level of organizing costs and transaction costs.  Despite
<br>
the arguments of the cyber enthusiasts, it is not the case that
<br>
new technologies, by reducing transaction costs, move the economy
<br>
toward the idealized market.  Businesses may even move toward
<br>
technology-enabled business practices with higher transaction costs
<br>
if they can make or save more money elsewhere (North and Wallis 1994).
<br>
And a technology that reduces transaction costs may reduce organizing
<br>
costs even more.  Many authors have observed that Coase's argument
<br>
is frustratingly indeterminate in practice, given that the relative
<br>
values of transaction and organizing costs are so hard to measure
<br>
or predict.  Yet the overall direction of contemporary industrial
<br>
organization provides powerful clues about the true picture.  First
<br>
of all, we are witnessing a historically unprecedented period of
<br>
industrial concentration.  Firms in both North America and Europe
<br>
are merging at a rate of trillions of dollars per year.  On the other
<br>
hand, firms are also selling, spinning off, or outsourcing their
<br>
non-core activities at a high rate as well.  These developments may
<br>
seem contradictory, in that the first one makes firms larger while
<br>
the second makes them smaller.  They are united by a single thread,
<br>
however, and that is the role of economies of scale.  Economies
<br>
of scale are those forces toward industrial concentration that are
<br>
created by the fixed costs of production.  If a firm can sell its
<br>
goods at a smaller unit cost by making a billion-dollar investment
<br>
in a factory, and if the market is large enough to distribute that
<br>
billion-dollar fixed cost while still underselling a competitor whose
<br>
fixed costs are lower, then the market will become dominated by a
<br>
smaller number of larger firms.
<br>
<p>Economic theory holds that economies of scale are limited, and that
<br>
their magnitude determines whether the natural structure of the
<br>
market is fragmentation, oligopoly, or monopoly.  Economies of scale
<br>
are a longstanding challenge to those who believe that the natural,
<br>
unregulated state of the market is one of efficiency, because a
<br>
sufficiently large oligopolist or monopolist can develop market power
<br>
and extract economically inefficient rents.  A rhetorical emphasis
<br>
on technologies that reduce transaction costs tends to alleviate
<br>
this embarrassment by presenting a plausible scenario by which the
<br>
electronic economy can transcend industrial-age concentration.  The
<br>
argument, however, is mistaken.  No Coasian analysis of the electronic
<br>
economy is complete until we assess the impact of distributed
<br>
information technologies on organizing costs and economies of scale.
<br>
And in both cases the picture is clear.  Simply put, distributed
<br>
information technologies make it vastly easier to capture economies of
<br>
scale and coordinate a large firm.
<br>
<p>The particular economies of scale that matter most here are the ones
<br>
that derive from fixed costs in information.  Because information can
<br>
be duplicated very cheaply, nearly all of the costs associated with
<br>
it are fixed.  And firms experience many fixed costs of information,
<br>
including software, policies, forms, regulatory filings, public
<br>
relations and advertising, market research, and product designs.
<br>
Computer networks can easily distribute these information objects
<br>
or their inputs and outputs throughout a far-flung global corporation
<br>
without regard for the number of operating units that have to be
<br>
served.  The key is that the operating units should all do the same
<br>
thing.  Information technology rewards scale, but only to the extent
<br>
that practices are standardized.
<br>
<p>That is a major reason why companies merge: to capture economies of
<br>
scale by laying off the information-producing head-office workers
<br>
of the acquired firm.  And that is why companies sell, spin off, or
<br>
outsource non-core activities: to eliminate activities that do not
<br>
enjoy economies of scale because they are different from the core
<br>
activities that do.  Transactions are complex beasts, embedded as
<br>
they are in a matrix of longstanding relationships and practices
<br>
(Hodgson 1988).  It is hard to reduce transaction costs.  Organizing
<br>
costs, however, are regularly reduced by large percentages, simply
<br>
by capturing economies of scale.  And so, quite to the contrary
<br>
of the &quot;friction-free economy&quot; model, it is altogether plausible
<br>
that information technology is a primary contributor to the wave of
<br>
industrial concentration that we read about each day in the business
<br>
pages.
<br>
<p>This wave of concentration, to be sure, is not all bad.  Economies
<br>
of scale are still economies, and an industry that captures more
<br>
such economies will pass them along to the consumer so long as the
<br>
market remains competitive -- that is, until market power emerges.
<br>
Conventional economists were largely unafraid of market power because
<br>
they believed in diseconomies of scale: the various factors that
<br>
limit economies of scale in practice.  Economies of scale require
<br>
standardization, but the world is not standardized.  Consumers' tastes
<br>
differ, as do cultures, legal systems, media, technical standards,
<br>
and other features of the market environment.  As globalization
<br>
proceeds, however, all of these types of diversity are being reduced.
<br>
English is spreading as a global language and technical standards are
<br>
converging on a global basis, in each case because of the benefits
<br>
of cross-border compatibility.  Trade treaties are harmonizing
<br>
many institutions, and economies of scale are driving a global
<br>
homogenization of mass media.
<br>
<p>As diseconomies of scale are destroyed, it becomes more and more
<br>
practical to run a globally integrated firm -- indeed, a global
<br>
monopoly -- provided, again, that the firm maintains a strong focus,
<br>
picking one activity and doing all of it for the whole world.  The
<br>
picture that results is a large collection of focused monopolies,
<br>
each of them taking a precision &quot;slice&quot; through the world economy by
<br>
means of global computer networks and by the grace of the standardized
<br>
world that it both depends upon and helps to create (Bryan, Fraser,
<br>
Oppenheim, and Rall 1999).
<br>
<p>This form of industrial organization can be understood in terms of
<br>
the market dynamics of knowledge.  It becomes economically practical
<br>
to create, codify, practice, and extend a body of knowledge only
<br>
once enough venues have been discovered where that knowledge can
<br>
be profitably applied.  Knowledge in this larger sense is not just
<br>
the contents of books and heads and hands, but a global network of
<br>
locations where the objects of that knowledge have been discovered,
<br>
created, counted, measured, and brought into a practical alignment
<br>
with the organization and its business plan.  Everyone and everything
<br>
in the world is criss-crossed with these knowledge-shaped slices,
<br>
and every one of them is an &quot;object&quot; in the sense that I described
<br>
earlier, bound digitally into an always-on network of relationships
<br>
on a global basis.
<br>
<p>It does not follow from this picture of rampant standardization,
<br>
of course, that the world is becoming utterly homogeneous, even if
<br>
one believes in the economic logic of information in its pure form.
<br>
Economic evidence suggests that nations and regions are specializing
<br>
to a degree within the world system, evolving the local configuration
<br>
of public and private institutions that supports a particular
<br>
model of production within the overall picture that I am describing
<br>
(Hollingsworth and Boyer 1999).
<br>
<p>More fundamentally, however, computer scientists know that the
<br>
commonplace association between standards and homogeneity is entirely
<br>
misleading.  The Internet, for example, is a standard that provides
<br>
a platform for the construction of a great diversity of activities.
<br>
Networked computer applications, more generally, are organized into
<br>
layers, each one built on top of others, and each providing a clearly
<br>
defined interface for others to be built on top of it (Messerschmitt
<br>
1999).  This layering scheme has engineering advantages for the
<br>
management of complexity and the division of labor in system design.
<br>
But it also has economic advantages for the capture of economies of
<br>
scope: the ability to use a single asset, in this case a computer
<br>
protocol and hardware and software conforming to it, for a variety
<br>
of different purposes, each of which helps to pay off its fixed
<br>
costs. Each protocol then tends to become dominant through the
<br>
network effects of compatibility (Shapiro and Varian 1998), though
<br>
the dominant protocol may or may not be owned, either legally or in
<br>
practice, by a single firm.  In this way, the logic of information
<br>
is modularizing large parts of the world.  Not all of it: a firm like
<br>
Microsoft that does own a particular service layer (in Microsoft's
<br>
case, personal computer operating systems and certain office
<br>
productivity applications) can attempt to leverage that monopoly
<br>
into other areas through nonmodular design.  The market dynamics of
<br>
modularity are complicated (Baldwin and Clark 2000, Schilling 2000).
<br>
But on the whole, the logic of focused monopolies together with the
<br>
logic of layered economies of scope are modularizing large parts of
<br>
the world.
<br>
<p>Is this good or bad?  In many ways it is good.  If it is possible to
<br>
outsource every possible aspect of a firm then it is easier to start
<br>
a firm.  Anyone with the ideas and connections can get moving quickly
<br>
because they can focus on the particular knowledge that provides them
<br>
with a competitive advantage.  Building the global network of sites
<br>
for the exercise of that knowledge -- whether through personal contact
<br>
or the distribution of a product -- is still a major undertaking,
<br>
and the building of a multitude of global professional networks was
<br>
one of the great unwritting stories of the 1990s.  This is an entirely
<br>
different picture of the work of starting a firm than was commonplace
<br>
even ten years ago, and it is still nascent and poorly understood.
<br>
The new picture is also beneficial for the efficiencies that derive
<br>
from the real-time wiring of global relationship networks, just as it
<br>
is dangerous for the increased potentials for globalized market power.
<br>
<p>The greatest danger, however, lurks beneath the explosion of
<br>
innovation and diversity that modular business and protocols make
<br>
possible.  Let us distinguish between two kinds of diversity: deep
<br>
and shallow.  Deep diversity is diversity that arises from independent
<br>
evolution in unrelated and completely incommensurable institutional,
<br>
cultural, and technical contexts.  Shallow diversity is diversity
<br>
that is generated from within a shared framework such as a grammar, a
<br>
set of modules, or the settings of parameters.  Shallow diversity can
<br>
apply to the structure of different products, or it can apply to the
<br>
infrastructures by which the products are designed, manufactured, and
<br>
distributed.
<br>
<p>Deep versus shallow diversity is obviously a continuum, with deep
<br>
diversity an impossible ideal at one end and shallow diversity a
<br>
common but not inevitable case at the other end.  Human biology, for
<br>
example relating to the universals of language, limits deep diversity,
<br>
as do millennia of encounters between cultures.  Nonetheless, as a
<br>
relative matter it is clear that many kinds of deep diversity are
<br>
disappearing from the world.  Indigenous languages and cultures
<br>
are dying, audiences for local literature and music are absorbing
<br>
&quot;global&quot; cultural influences, technologies and institutions are being
<br>
harmonized, and so on.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, economies of scale and scope are producing many strong
<br>
drives toward shallow diversity.  These drives allow a manufacturer
<br>
to move away from a single monolithic standard to a degree of
<br>
mix-and-match, and flexible manufacturing technologies, together
<br>
with computer-aided design, make it possible to change products
<br>
rapidly from within a standardized system of distribution.  From this
<br>
perspective, the world is not moving toward an extreme of homogeneity,
<br>
but to a high level of shallow diversity.  The world is still heavily
<br>
standardized, but the standard applies not to the overall product
<br>
but to the framework that is used to generate a shallow diversity of
<br>
products.
<br>
<p>Shallow diversity is certainly adequate for many purposes.  But a
<br>
world without deep diversity would nonetheless be much poorer.  The
<br>
hyperefficiency that settles on particular frameworks of shallowly
<br>
diverse production may be brittle and lacking in the capacity to
<br>
shift to a qualitatively different model should circumstances require
<br>
it.  A world of shallow diversity might be caught in a local optimum
<br>
of historical development: productive to be sure, but not nearly as
<br>
productive as it could be if it shifted to a qualitatively different
<br>
path of development.  Many theories of institutional learning,
<br>
such as that of Friedrich Hayek (1960), require different islands
<br>
of evolutionary development to generate the deep diversity over
<br>
which natural selection operates, but the whole purpose of globally
<br>
integrated production networks is to absorb such islands and bring
<br>
them into conformance with the standard.
<br>
<p>Lastly, a world without deep diversity would leave us poorer as human
<br>
beings.  Perhaps we will maintain always-on connections to everyone we
<br>
know, but that will do us little good if none of those people knows or
<br>
feels anything that is deeply different from what we know or feel in
<br>
our own lives.  It is only through the encounter with difference that
<br>
we are able to question our own assumptions, and it is only through
<br>
the encounter with difference that we can tell the difference between
<br>
our own heads and the radical strangeness and challenge of the real
<br>
world.  In a world of shallow diversity, we will prosper and we will
<br>
die.  We must learn to value and conserve deep diversity, and we must
<br>
learn what it would even mean to replenish what has been lost.
