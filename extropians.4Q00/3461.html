<em>&gt; &gt; If it is not free (speech not beer), not open, then there are limits on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your ability to fully utilize it.  If you are interested in it being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more powerful then you are interested in it being more  open/free.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolute disagreement, for precisely the reasons I have already cited.
</em><br>
Your
<br>
<em>&gt; direct equation of &quot;power&quot; with &quot;freeness&quot; is simplisitic.  Does money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become more powerful if it's free?  Or it is made useful by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control/limits we place on it?
</em><br>
<p>I realize I'm probably not going to change your mind on the subject (God
<br>
knows you aren't going to change mine), but as long as we're discussing
<br>
amicably...
<br>
<p>OK, take your money analogy.  Money does become much more useful when its
<br>
&quot;distributed.&quot;  Say there are a billion people on the Earth and a trillion
<br>
dollars.  If one person has a trillion dollars, money is useless and has no
<br>
meaning.  If one billion people each of a thousand dollars, suddenly you
<br>
have the potential for a robust a money-based economy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Laws of scarcity.  Maybe you think it would be nice if every kid on
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; planet could have a mint copy of Action Comics #1, but you can't argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that such a distribution wouldn't destroy an interesting market.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not saying freedom of information would not have its drawbacks for some
<br>
people.  But I am saying that those relatively few drawbacks would be more
<br>
than offset by the universal advantages made possible by open info.  Sure,
<br>
if all info were available to everyone all the time, that would eliminate
<br>
the &quot;I've got X and you don't, nanny-nanny-nanny&quot; phenomena.  Personally,
<br>
that I could live without.  If I am free to create my world the way I want
<br>
it to be, I do not begrudge you the same opportunity.  If I am happy with my
<br>
library of hundreds of scientific texts, why would I feel bad about your
<br>
library of thousands of science fiction novels?
<br>
<p>Would you really miss the market for a limited supply of comic books if you
<br>
were able to enjoy every comic ever printed, in pristine condition?  Are
<br>
your possessions really made that much more enjoyable to you merely because
<br>
there are people who want the same things you have, but are unable to get
<br>
them?  So much so that you would not be willing to part with such elitism in
<br>
order to enjoy the bounty that free info would bring?  Really?  Truly?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes there is a place for secrets - in war or the equivalent, one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; personal information and affairs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's not the position of the post to which I replied:  Zero Powers

<br>
<p>You might say I'm a dreamer.  But I'm not the only one.  Someday you will
<br>
join us, and the world will be as one.  Yes I envision a world where secrets
<br>
and their raisons d'etre (specifically including, but not necessarily
<br>
limited to, war) are unecessary relics of the past.  Will it happen
<br>
tomorrow?  No.  In our (natural) lifetimes, perhaps not.  Someday?  I hope
<br>
and believe so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Further,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you specifically use the term 'each of us' referring to individuals: can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think of a few (thousand) ways in which the maximal power and good of
</em><br>
an
<br>
<em>&gt; individual is highly dependent on the controlled flow of information?
</em><br>
<p>I can think of ways that individuals benefit from secrets.  But I can also
<br>
see that those &quot;benefits&quot; pale in comparison to those which flow from the
<br>
freedom of information.
