<p>yeah  I'll grow up a &quot;Buit&quot;. I have consciously been limiting myself no more 
<br>
than four or  five SHORT postings per WEEK, since the volume complaints 
<br>
started. I do use delete a lot, but to be insulted this way is unredeemable.

Nice retort:  a four page letter scathing with punitive anger... sheesh...

<p>Request to the remaining NICE, sane, people on this list ('gene?). If 
<br>
anything  future/good (juicy URLs) show up on Robotics, Neural nets, new

<br>
<p>&nbsp;I'll check the archives for a safer haven...

<em> &gt; I appreciate your enthusiasm as shown in your participation on the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Extropians List. However, I'm getting complaints from a number of people
</em><br>
<em> &gt; about excessive posting from a few individuals, you being among them.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Hal Finney -- the person who has expressed this feeling on the list, but
</em><br>
<em> &gt; not the only person -- suggested a sensible guideline: No more than six
</em><br>
<em> &gt; posts per day. That makes it more likely that each one will be thoughtful.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; It will also reduce the traffic jam that threatens to induce people to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; leave the List in frustration.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I'd appreciate you keeping your posting volume down to that level.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Thanks,

&nbsp;How sad we have so many whiners and complainers on a list that supposedly
<br>
&nbsp;supports high technology. Can't these crybabies figure out how to use a 
<br>
delete
<br>
&nbsp;button or an e-mail filter? Oh, well. I guess that just goes to prove that
<br>
&nbsp;opposites attract: entropic nudges are attracted to extropic glitter.
<br>
&nbsp;Just to be on the safe side, I've decided to post no more than 5 (count 'em,
<br>
&nbsp;five) messages to the list per day. (This is the third one today -- but I've
<br>
&nbsp;received 55 messages from the list.) If we find anyone else breaking the 
<br>
volume
<br>
&nbsp;barrier, we'll just send extra copies of your recommendation to them, all 
<br>
right?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Here's a sample of today's Extropy list mail with some playful remarks.

</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Wrong. Nazis were supported by the Catholic church, which is somewhat

theistic.

&nbsp;Uncle Sam has nukes so fresh you have to slap them. Neutron bombs are no

&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Retaliation should ideally be punishing, but punishment is often unconscious

&nbsp;enough to deny it has anything to do with retaliation. For example, silly

people

&nbsp;may punish us with their idiocy, but not in a retaliatory fashion.
