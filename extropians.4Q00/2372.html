<em>&gt; WOW. Talk about a supersaturated memetic solution. No wonder there were so

many
<br>

that
<br>
<em>&gt; that has changed much). They were literally being programmed by their
</em><br>
language
<br>
<em>&gt; acting as a memetic compiler, creating executable memes based on the
</em><br>
gibberish
<br>
<em>&gt; of nature, like reading the random typing of monkeys and finding
</em><br>
Shakespeare in
<br>
<em>&gt; every sentence.
</em><br>
<p>We used to believe that a million monkeys typing on a million typewriters
<br>
would produce great works of literature.  Now with the Internet, we know
<br>
that's not true.  (I don't know where I stole this from.)
<br>
<p>Yes, the Hebrew glyphs are fascinating.  I wrote an article on the evolution
<br>
of the alphabet many years back.  The original writings evolved from little
<br>
clay figures of cattle that were used to track inventory of real herds in
<br>
Persia.  After a couple of thousand years, someone figured out that you
<br>
could depress these figures on a wet clay tablet to make a record of them.
<br>
Later, they stopped pressing the little figurines into clay and drew the
<br>
impressions by hand.  Original had drawings were pictographic, like Chinese
<br>
and Egyptian.  Eventually they became more stylized for easier writing.
<br>
Concepts evolved from real-world objects, to effigy figures, to pictography
<br>
drawings to abstract cuneiform sigils.  The old form Semitic alphabet that
<br>
the Old Testament was written in (which looks like cuneiform, not the curly
<br>
Aramaic letters of modern Hebrew) were the earliest alphabet that was
<br>
phonetically used to spell out other words and not just what the pictures
<br>
represented.  Each letter has a real-world object name.  The symbols in the
<br>
Phoenician-Semitic alphabet look similar to the Egyptian hieroglyphs for
<br>
those same objects.  It now is believed that the Hebrews learned writing
<br>
from the Egyptians, but were the first ones to extrapolate to and phonetic
<br>
alphabet to spell out words instead of showing little pictures of things.
<br>
The Egyptians seem to have developed their phonetic symbology later.  This
<br>
makes Hebrew the earliest alphabet in the world.
<br>
<p>I forgot to mention that since letters have real world objects associated
<br>
with the, the mere spelling of a name contained objects.  If an ancient name
<br>
was said to mean &quot;God provides for his people&quot;, it literally meant that the
<br>
person's name was spelled something like
<br>
[Male][High][Spirit][Provision][Tribe].  Also, names and words were not
<br>
separated.  In English, certain names are just names.  In Biblical Hebrew,
<br>
all names are real words.  It is the reader's interpretation whether they
<br>
are people, deities or what.  The words might say &quot;High Mightiness demands
<br>
vengeance&quot;, and it could be read as &quot;Vengeance is mine sayeth the Most
<br>
High.&quot;  While other words that said, &quot;Wisdom dictates that a fool and his
<br>
money are soon parted&quot; might be read without invoking a deity.  It is up to
<br>
the reader to decide if this is Sophia, the Goddess of Wisdom (Sophia is the
<br>
Hebrew word for wisdom), or if this is just a proverb.  Male catholic clergy
<br>
translated male personifications as God, whereas female personifications
<br>
were ignored.  Gnostic mystics translating the exact same Hebrew symbols
<br>
read their Goddess Sophia all over the Bible, being more of a major
<br>
character than the God of Moses.  Simple sentences could be read by one
<br>
person to describe Deities and Persons, while another person reads it as
<br>
abstract concepts with no individual involved.
<br>
<p>I also forgot to mention the mystical concept of writing in general.  When
<br>
most people are illiterate and may not know about writing, the little
<br>
squiggly marks written by Priests and Shamans look like mystic art.  Imagine
<br>
that a priest can take a clay pot and make all sorts of mystical artwork on
<br>
it while chanting words of his intent.  Now take that pot to another priest
<br>
and he can concentrate on it closely and sense what the first priest had
<br>
enchanted (meaning to chant) into the object.  Obviously, the first priest's
<br>
mental thoughts were somehow projected onto the pot and could be gleaned by
<br>
the second priest just by examining the pot.  The initial beginnings of
<br>
writing obviously appeared to give magical abilities to those who could use
<br>
these special sigils.
