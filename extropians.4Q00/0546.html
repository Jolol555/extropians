&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 31'st update on my fly longevity experiments. In
<br>
Run #30 I have a second look at Rooibos tea, after getting a
<br>
positive result in Run# 29. I also look at red grape juice, since
<br>
in Run #14 longevity was slightly higher in flies fed grape punch,
<br>
as opposed to some other fruit juices. Finally I yet again look at
<br>
blueberry juice. Despite my high expectations, canned blueberry
<br>
juice yielded no benefit in Run #22. I decided to check the juice
<br>
from frozen blueberries this time, hoping for a hit.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately I made a silly mistake in setting up Run #30, which
<br>
virtually destroyed the usefullness of the results. Instead of using
<br>
my regular 5 tablespoons of fluid added to 20 mg fly food, I added
<br>
6 tablespoons. The surprising consequence of this mistake was
<br>
the presence of condensation inside the milk bottles housing flies
<br>
given rooibos tea, as well (formerly frozen) blueberry juice. The
<br>
surface tension of dew drops can be deadly to flies, which drown very
<br>
easily. Since only the control, canned blueberry juice, and grape
<br>
juice bottles had no condensation, only in these bottles was a fair
<br>
test given.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: One of the rooibos tea bottles used tea that had been boiled
<br>
for 20 minutes, rather than just steeped. Boiling did appear to reduce 
<br>
survival.

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I also continued my cryobiology experiment, testing the effect of
<br>
pynogenol on fly freezing resistance. If pynogenol does not exert any
<br>
direct effect on freezing damage, then if it improved survival after frozen
<br>
storage, it would do so by other short term beneficial actions. These
<br>
might include suppression of freeze radical activity associated with
<br>
reperfusion damage, and inhibition of blood clotting. Before the experiment
<br>
I hypothesized that if pynogenol did not directly reduce freezing damage,
<br>
any improvement in survival it should accrue only for short storage periods,
<br>
where freezing damage is as yet not severe. With longer storage where
<br>
there is zero survival of control flies, pynogenol fed flies should also have
<br>
zero survival. This is exactly what happened.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One interesting observation was that the first census a couple of hours
<br>
after the first 90 minute period of freezer storage yielded very poor survival,
<br>
as evidenced by detection of movement. I did not expect the great increase
<br>
in survival, when a second census 3 days later was performed. Although I
<br>
had expected all the flies to be dead by then, many flies particularly in the
<br>
pynogenol 300 mg bottle had sprung miraculously back to life.
