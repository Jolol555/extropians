<p><em>&gt; Though I have begun this question (perhaps) unnecessarily

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>Dan:
<br>
<p>Still digging hard to catch up on badly backed-up correspondence, I'm amused 
<br>
at the messages I'm stopping to reply to.  This one deserves a lot of thought 
<br>
so, naturally, I'll toss off the first thing that comes to mind.  
<br>
<p>Having just weathered what I hope has been the heaviest seas of &quot;The Mother 
<br>
of All Midlife Crises&quot; in the last few years, it's interesting to think about 
<br>
career and life choices from another perspective, i.e. someone just getting 
<br>
out of college in 2000, instead of 1979, as I did.  I basically gave very, 
<br>
very little thought to a &quot;career&quot; when I was in undergraduate school, 
<br>
studying things that interested me and that I enjoyed learning, with 
<br>
essentially no thought at all for how what I was doing in college might &quot;pay 
<br>
off&quot; in later life.  I'm constantly struck by how very different the young 
<br>
people I mentor professionally now are from the way I was when I was their 
<br>
age.  The folks I work with now in their mid-20s (after going &quot;straight 
<br>
through&quot; to law school) seem so incredibly focused on establishing a career 
<br>
and making money.  When I got out of college, I was still primarily 
<br>
interested in what can't really be called anything more than &quot;having fun&quot; and 
<br>
learning by having diverse life experiences and relationships, trying on 
<br>
ideas and emotional settings to see just what sort of person I was.  Working 
<br>
in those years was just a way to make enough money to support myself day to 
<br>
day and pay for the occasional travel or change of abode.  Such things don't 
<br>
seem to be nearly as important to folks in their 20s now - I suppose I'm 
<br>
experiencing sort of the reverse of the &quot;kids these days!&quot; thinking my 
<br>
parents' generation engaged in.
<br>
<p>I didn't really focus on the idea of a career until at least the age of 25 
<br>
and really didn't do anything about it for more than a year.  I started law 
<br>
school when I was 27 and didn't start practicing until right after I turned 
<br>
30, at which point I suppose I started thinking of myself as an &quot;adult&quot;.  
<br>
What I've seen since has borne out the wisdom of how I proceeded in those 
<br>
years, at least for people like me who have a lot of different interests.  By 
<br>
the time I began working at &quot;a career&quot;, I'd developed some deeply-thought-out 
<br>
values about life and had had a LOT of different experiences.  I see many 
<br>
creative youngsters who didn't take the time to do this experiencing a kind 
<br>
of grief after three or four years of working at an absorbing career like 
<br>
law: With a palpable smack to the forehead and an exclamation of &quot;I forgot to 
<br>
have a life!&quot; they run out of steam and can't stay focused on the hard work 
<br>
of becoming really professionally competent.
<br>
<p>Now some of this may well be more acute in the legal profession, where 
<br>
developing well-seasoned judgment is the primary task of the young lawyer.  
<br>
Perhaps in more &quot;scientific&quot; fields one can more successfully &quot;double-track&quot; 
<br>
gaining basic life experience and developing professional competence.  But 
<br>
there's also probably an irreducible core of experience one has to have to 
<br>
become an emotionally and morally well-rounded individual.  And some of that 
<br>
experience simply takes time and the kinds of diverse activities that being 
<br>
tied to a specific career track isn't always consistent with.  So, all thing 
<br>
being equal, my advice would be to take your time and spend as much of your 
<br>
youth in personal exploration and adventure as you can.
<br>
<p>But all things may well not be equal.  The next 20 years for someone just 
<br>
getting out of college in 2000 are going to be different in many ways than 
<br>
the last 20 years have been for me and others my age.  What if some of our 
<br>
more optimistic techno-social musings here regarding the next couple of 
<br>
decades turn out to be true, and being in the right place at the right time - 
<br>
with enough cash in hand - means the difference between being on the cutting 
<br>
edge of the transformation of the human animal and watching from the 
<br>
sidelines?  Five or six years of &quot;goofing off&quot; could mean the difference 
<br>
between being a player and a spectator in the biggest game of all time.
<br>
<p>It's a tough question, and one I don't have any answers to.  Some balance 
<br>
between the two paths is probably best, at least at first.  Choosing options 
<br>
that leave you as much personal freedom as possible, while still &quot;getting 
<br>
started&quot; on a career is going to be a tough job, but one you've got to keep 
<br>
in mind, because 1) we can't be SURE that the Big Changes will happen very 
<br>
quickly and 2) there really is no time like the present: We LIVE in the 
<br>
present and we LEARN in the present and too much sacrifice of the present is 
<br>
just miserliness with our own spirits.
<br>
<p>Good luck . . .
