Samantha: 
<br>
<p>I agree with you often. However, for a moment, please step away from
<br>
&quot;THE greater good&quot;, which is a loaded phrase employed by tyrants and
<br>
those who would be such. 
<br>
<p>Consider that arguably, determining the good *is* philosophy's purpose,
<br>
or one. Ethics and aesthetics together constitute &quot;what is good&quot;. The
<br>
pre-socratics and Socrates himself, if memory serves, were greatly
<br>
concerned with this, as am I. By the time of Aristotle, &quot;what is true&quot;
<br>
got elevated to the top of the heap.
<br>
<p>It does get stickier when you try to run &quot;good&quot; through a utilitarian
<br>
filter--greatest good for the greatest number&quot;--and I very much agree
<br>
that that's a perilous path occupied by many wolves in sheep's'
<br>
clothing. But &quot;what ought I to be doing&quot;, nonetheless, is very much why
<br>
I personally care about developing my own philosophy and its application
<br>
in my everyday life.
<br>
<p>Among other things, I find the metaphysics of quality (see www.moq.org)
<br>
of periodic interest. It has the advantage of being summarily dismissed
<br>
by many professional philosophologists as essential emotivism. :) That,
<br>
and Barkley's pancritical rationalism. I try to continue my engagement
<br>
with both.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Does philosophy owe anything, as a discipline, to promote the greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; good?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is philosophy about also about problem solving?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't understand how my article inspired those questions, but...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Does mechanical engineering &quot;owe anything, as a discipline, to promote the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; greater good?&quot;  I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but just to show that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophy can be considered just as mechanical engineering, as a discipline
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or a body of knowledge.  In either case, people use them for good or ill.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please tell me first who gets to determine what the &quot;greater good&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and second who gets to enforce that determination on those who might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree with it.  Then tell me if the &quot;greater good&quot; is actually a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valid construct for evaluating any human activity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Philosophies vary a lot too.  One shouldn't assume that all of them are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equal or as useful or as valid.  In this vein, it's my belief that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophy's purpose, against which it can't be measured, is to help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individuals to live life.  So in a sense, it should be for the good, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there is a lot of difference between different people and different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophical systems over what is good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is not philosophy's purpose.
</em><br>
