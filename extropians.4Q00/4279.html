<p><p><em>&gt;Al Gore's National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1986 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;authorized the National Science Foundation to create NSFNET. Ever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hear of it?  NSF replaced the military Arpanet as the managers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Internet.  This brought the Internet out of the military
</em><br>
<em>&gt;realm.
</em><br>
<p>Al Gore's National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1986?
<br>
Gee that's odd Harvey, a Google search turned up a wealth of
<br>
information on this act, but not one mention of Al Gore.
<br>
<p>Here in Illinois a local politician tried last year to claim that
<br>
her father who was chairman of the committee that approved this,
<br>
that technically he created the Internet....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The National Science Foundation connected universities together. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They linked in Canada and then other countries.  They linked in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;e-mail first, then direct network access for UUnet, CompuServe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;MCI Mail, The Well, and other network providers.  The separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;networks were first connected together by NSF funding.  NSF
</em><br>
<em>&gt;removed commercial restrictions and then allowed ISP dial-access
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from private homes. NSF established the InterNIC to manage the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;network.  The upgrade to 56K backbone was funded by NSF.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;upgrade to T1 backbone was  funded by NSF.
</em><br>
<p>I know how it works Harvey, I do this for a living, as I pointed
<br>
out I've been permanently online since the fall of 1989. I
<br>
witnessed many of these events firsthand.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Exactly what exact part of this &quot;Information Superhighway&quot; do you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;claim was never built?
</em><br>
<p>None of it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Read some selected Internet history from Hobb's Internet Timeline
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at &lt;<a href="http://info.isoc.org/guest/zakon/Internet/History/HIT.html">http://info.isoc.org/guest/zakon/Internet/History/HIT.html</a>&gt;:
</em><br>
<p>Thanks, this is a handy online reference, I prefer Katie Hafner and
<br>
Michael Lyons 1996 book &quot;Where Wizards Stay up Late: The origins of
<br>
the Internet&quot;.
<br>
<p>1969 ARPANET commissioned by DoD
<br>
1981 National Science Foundation funds CSNET for researchers
<br>
1983 CSNET/ARPANET gateway established to form first
<br>
&quot;inter-network&quot;
<br>
1984 Number of Internet hosts reaches 1000
<br>
1986 AL GORE'S NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AUTHORIZATION ACT
<br>
<p>That darn Google, I found lot's of references to this act, but no
<br>
mention of Al Gore, hey wait a minute! neither your reference above
<br>
nor &quot;Where Wizards Stay up late mentions him in connection with
<br>
this either! Conspiracy!
<br>
<p>1986 NSFNET created with 56K links
<br>
1987 Number of Internet hosts reaches 10,000
<br>
1988 AL GORE'S NATIONAL HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ACT
<br>
<p>Yep that Goggle is broke, no mention of this either, although if
<br>
you leave off the Al Gore part you can come up with some
<br>
references. This does not appear to have been approved, in fact not
<br>
till 1991. Neither of the above cited references helps either.
<br>
<p>1988 NSFNET upgraded to T1 lines
<br>
1989 Number of Internet hosts reaches 100,000
<br>
1990 ARPANET shuts down
<br>
1990 Canada Net connects to NSFNET
<br>
1991 AL GORE'S US HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING ACT
<br>
<p>Hey good news, there is some reference to him in this although it
<br>
of course is not named as identified as above.
<br>
<p>1991 NSFNET removes commercial restrictions from Internet
<br>
1992 Number of Internet hosts reaches 1,000,000
<br>
1993 InterNIC created by NSF to provide Internet Services
<br>
1995 NSF creates new NSFNET just for research, leaving original 
<br>
NSFNET infrastructure in place as Internet backbone
<br>
<p>First of all, almost all of your previous post came word for word
<br>
from www.firstmonday.dk/issues5_10wiggins/
<br>
<p>What ever happened to the part Al approved that made the Internet
<br>
available to all of us, you know the part I disproved by
<br>
demonstrating I had been online since 1989?
<br>
<p>Now how about some important dates you decided to leave out:
<br>
<p>1969 first IMP goes online (official birthdate of the Internet)
<br>
1994 25th anniversary of the creation of the Internet.
<br>
<p>Al has had a long interest in this granted, but almost from the
<br>
start he has tried to create a Big Brother Big Government version
<br>
of the Internet. A government run monopoly to replace the then
<br>
thriving Internet. These attempts failed.
<br>
<p>He was neither the central reason or an essential element in the
<br>
Internet's creation, as recognized by the people who did create it.
<br>
<p>The history of the Internet is well known, and well documented, and
<br>
will not be successfully re-written by Al's supporters, even by
<br>
posting the same post to the list three times.....
<br>
<p>The fact is Al has supported every attempt at regulating the
<br>
Internet, censoring the Internet, as well as the Digital telephony
<br>
act which as I stated previously put a government back door into
<br>
every telephone C.O.
<br>
<p>The Clipper Chip...
<br>
<p>The prosecution of Phil Zimmerman.....
