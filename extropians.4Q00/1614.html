(CONT'D)
<br>
<p>Let me explain how contraining the scale of the birthing environments to
<br>
&quot;planets&quot; and observers to &quot;humans&quot; creates a logical loop-hole through
<br>
which the epistemological filter argument is creeping:
<br>
<p>To be clear: the argument I'm addressing is thus (I'll emphasis the part I'm
<br>
really going after):
<br>
<p>&quot;One 'data point' (one planet and one intelligent life) tells us nothing
<br>
about the possible appearance of other such data points, since no matter
<br>
what the odds of a data point coming into existence, we know that we are
<br>
necessarily in one of the realities that has done so at least once.
<br>
**However, a SECOND data point would be useful information (a second planet
<br>
and a second intelligent life.)**&quot;
<br>
<p>Without the discretionary ability arbitrarily decided upon in Nick's
<br>
phrasing of the AP, this concept of a second data point goes away: it's all
<br>
*one data point* -- i.e.: _The single set of all observers in this
<br>
reality._  Making a distinction between 'our' planet and 'their' planet is
<br>
an
<br>
arbitrary use of locality as means of seperating the two processes and fails
<br>
to recognize that both planets share 'this reality' as a common factor.
<br>
<p>To restate simply:  The AP does not recognize a second intelligence as being
<br>
a second data point.  It's just more intelligences in the same ole' petri
<br>
dish.  The only data points in the AP are *other realities,* which may or
<br>
may not sustain life at all.  The AP -does- have discretionary power over
<br>
those realities-- we know observers must necessarily exist in realities that
<br>
are being observed.
<br>
<p>The separation of locality is a very important distinction for the purposes
<br>
of doing hard science, but irrelevent to the AP which addresses itself to
<br>
_the nature of the reality that we inhabit_ (life sustaining)
<br>
<p>This is why I asked if Martians would count as a second data point.  Just so
<br>
I can re-use the example for a second, let's pretend that there are no
<br>
interstellar transmission vectors available to life: Martian life counts as
<br>
a separate instance of the emergence of intelligence in the universe.  (Ok
<br>
Eugene?)  If I arbitrarily reword my posing of the AP, I get the following:
<br>
<p>&quot;No matter how small a fraction of all solar systems in our infinite
<br>
universe develop life, we would by neccessity find that we (Earthlings and
<br>
Martians) originate from one of the exceptional ones that did.&quot;
<br>
<p>By changing &quot;planets&quot; to &quot;solar systems&quot; and we [humans] to we (Earthlings
<br>
and Martians), we find again that our observations are biased: we apparently
<br>
aren't able to make predictions about life appearing in other solar systems
<br>
(under the AP.)  This will continue ad infinitum-- while tremendously
<br>
rewarding to hard science, the observation of additional intelligences adds
<br>
no further information under the AP.
<br>
<p>My point is this: for any arbitrary demarkation under the AP, there exists a
<br>
higher scale demarkation that invalidates the usefulness of additional data
<br>
points.  The whole thing is a tautology, under the turtles: more turtles.
<br>
The AP is only valid at the broadest scale (and therefore, it doesn't say
<br>
very much.)
<br>
<p><p><p>Now, if you want to argue this, please address the major question: why
<br>
*wouldn't* we share in the observer bias under the AP with other observers
<br>
possessed of differing locality?
