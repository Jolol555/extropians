Paris, Nov 17 (Reuters)
<br>
<p>France's highest appeals court, in a landmark case with broad
<br>
legal and ethical implications, ruled on Friday that a youth born
<br>
with severe handicaps could be COMPENSATED SIMPLY
<br>
FOR BEING BORN rather than aborted.
<br>
<p>The parents of a deaf, retarded and nearly blind boy, now 17,
<br>
won an appeal for compensation on grounds that doctors and
<br>
a medical laboratory should have prevented the birth after finding
<br>
out during the pregnancy that his mother had contracted rubella.
<br>
The disease, also known as German measles, can cause severe
<br>
disabilities to a foetus. Josette and Christian Perruche said they
<br>
would have aborted their son Nicolas if they had not been told
<br>
there was no danger.
<br>
<p>``Since mistakes committed by the doctors and the laboratory while
<br>
carrying out their contract with Mrs Perruche prevented her from
<br>
exercising her choice to end the pregnancy to avoid the birth of a
<br>
handicapped child, THE LATTER CAN ASK for compensation for damages
<br>
resulting from this handicap,'' the Cour de Cassation said in its decision.
<br>
Doctors' groups, the Roman Catholic church and Unapeei, the largest
<br>
association defending mentally handicapped children, all declined to
<br>
comment on the pioneering decision until it had seen the full legal text.
<br>
<p>The court upheld a lower court ruling to grant compensation, which the
<br>
Paris prosecutor's office had challenged arguing that would create
<br>
a ``RIGHT NOT TO BE BORN&quot; and amount to deciding that some lives
<br>
were WORTH LIVING while others were not. The prosecution also argued
<br>
that upholding the appeal could set a precedent for children unhappy
<br>
with their lives for less serious reasons to also sue for compensation.
<br>
Critics warned this concept of ``wrongful birth'' could open the door to
<br>
countless lawsuits against doctors if parents were not satisfied with
<br>
their babies. Fearing litigation, doctors might pressure women to have
<br>
eugenic abortions rather than risk giving birth to less-than-perfect
<br>
infants,
<br>
or ask them to sign waivers before treating them throughout a difficult
<br>
pregnancy, they said. This could also upset the basis for France's abortion
<br>
law, said Claude Sureau, president of the National Medical Academy.
<br>
``If one grants a child the right to be compensated for a mistake committed
<br>
while it was an embryo, one recognises its legal rights at that point,''
<br>
he told the daily Le Monde. ``That can put a question mark over all our laws
<br>
allowing abortion,'' he said. If a handicapped child can sue a doctor for a
<br>
mistaken diagnosis, Sureau added, it could presumably also sue its parents
<br>
for not opting for an abortion.
<br>
<p>But the Cour de Cassation, the highest appeals court in the country,
<br>
upheld the decision that Nicolas HAD THE RIGHT TO DAMAGES for his
<br>
condition.
<br>
<p>The parents -- who had already won compensation for themselves in an
<br>
earlier trial -- fought the case on behalf of their son, who, with an
<br>
intelligence
<br>
quotient of 50 or lower, was not mentally capable of following it.
<br>
<p>The case will now go back to the lower court, which should determine the
<br>
amount of compensation to pay to Nicolas, who lives in an institution for
<br>
the
<br>
severely handicapped.
