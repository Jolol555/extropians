<p>
there's an aspect of pattern-identity theory that I have been interested in 
<br>
to see if there is any process that may be capable of auto-recording the data 
<br>
that t Kind of like Santa's book on which little kiddies have been naughty 
<br>
and which have been nice. (Groan) anyway, there was this SciAm article by a 
<br>
few years ago that provoked me into looking for any info on this weird 
<br>
conjecture. 
<br>
<p>I am wondering if there was a possible info storage substrate already built 
<br>
into the universe? The article dealt with a mythological court case in which 
<br>
one physicist's recipe for Hungarian goulash was cruelly, tossed into a black 
<br>
hole. The judge in the case eventually ruled that the recipe was not lost 
<br>
eternally, but could be theoretically recovered by extraordinary, but 
<br>
&quot;normal&quot; means. Totally weird and bogus, I realize ,and yet it seems like 
<br>
something worth learning about. Pursuing mirages, I know, but maybe we'd find 
<br>
that missing book of yours, as well as my socks that go missing from the 
<br>
clothes dryer. Also are you going to get this book published, stateside?

<p>&lt;&lt; Inside the computer I'm writing this on, there's a book I'm currently
<br>
&nbsp;finishing. (There are also some identical copies on disks and other
<br>
&nbsp;machines, but let's pretend they don't exist because I was too stupid to
<br>
&nbsp;back the files up.)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Someone comes into my house and trashes the hard drive, folds, spindles and
<br>
&nbsp;mutilates it, fubars the fucker.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Why should I care? To some extent the patterns in the book can be found all
<br>
&nbsp;around us. The words are in the dictionary. Many of the phrases have been
<br>
&nbsp;uttered before, and who knows, might be uttered again. The universe goes
<br>
&nbsp;on, and life
<br>
&nbsp;continues, although mine is totally down the toilet for a while. The book
<br>
&nbsp;is the only thing that has vanished. And after all, who cares about a book
<br>
&nbsp;or the months of effort frozen into it?
