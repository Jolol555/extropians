<p>Powering the Nanoworld
<br>
<p>Robert F. Service
<br>
<p>Whereas most scientists who long to produce nanoscale machines might
<br>
look to Henry Ford for inspiration, Devens Gust seems to have his
<br>
sights set on John D. Rockefeller. Today, researchers are making
<br>
rudimentary nanomachines by harnes-sing biological motor proteins
<br>
--such as those involved in muscle contraction--and plunking them down
<br>
on surfaces in hopes of getting them to do some new types of
<br>
work. That work takes energy.  &quot;If you're going to do this, you will
<br>
need fuel,&quot; says Gust, a chemist at Arizona State University in
<br>
Tempe. And like Rockefeller, whose Standard Oil provided the juice
<br>
that launched Ford's automotive revolution, Gust is ready to prime the
<br>
pumps.
<br>
<p>Gust and a handful of colleagues have built tiny refineries that
<br>
convert the energy in sunlight to chemical fuel. The fuel in this case
<br>
is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the same energy-rich molecule that
<br>
powers chemical reactions inside cells. At last August's meeting of
<br>
the American Chemical Society (ACS) in Washington, D.C., Gust reported
<br>
that he and his colleagues had collaborated with other groups to run
<br>
their protein-based molecular machines on little more than
<br>
sunlight. &quot;They're like GM [General Motors] and Ford, and we're like
<br>
Exxon,&quot; Gust says.
<br>
<p>Gust didn't start out to make the world's smallest gas stations. For
<br>
much of the past 15 years, he has worked with Arizona State colleagues
<br>
Thomas and Ana Moore and numerous students to mimic nature's ability
<br>
to harvest light energy--an ability on which nearly all life depends
<br>
either directly or indirectly. In 1997, Gust and the Moores reported
<br>
in Nature that they had developed a unique photosynthesis mimic inside
<br>
the protected confines of liposomes, spherical membranes made from two
<br>
layers of fatty lipid molecules.  Spanning those lipid membranes are
<br>
three-part molecules called artificial reaction centers, after the
<br>
apparatus in chlorophyll that allows plants to absorb sunlight and put
<br>
that energy to work. In this case, a square-shaped porphyrin group
<br>
absorbs light, which kicks an electron out of its normal ground state
<br>
and into a higher energy level, leaving behind a positively charged
<br>
electron vacancy called a hole. The electron and hole are then snapped
<br>
up by a pair of chemical groups in the reaction centers, separating
<br>
the charges and creating a chemical potential. In a multistep process,
<br>
the electron-grabbing molecule then uses this charge separation to
<br>
shuttle protons from the outside to the inside of the liposome.
<br>
<p>Light-harvesting bacteria and plants use a similar buildup of protons
<br>
and a protein called ATP synthase to generate ATP. And following
<br>
nature's lead, in another Nature paper in 1998, the Arizona State
<br>
researchers showed that they could incorporate ATP synthase proteins
<br>
inside their liposomes and generate ATP. As the protons pass through
<br>
the ATP synthase molecule to the outside of the liposome, they cause
<br>
the protein to spin, a mechanical motion that helps create ATP, which
<br>
is dumped outside the liposome.
<br>
<p>That set the stage for powering nanotech devices. One such set of
<br>
devices--nanopropellers--is being developed by Carlo Montemagno of
<br>
Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and is reported on page 1555
<br>
of this issue. Montemagno and his colleagues also use ATP synthase,
<br>
which harbors a tiny shaft that spins inside a cylinder. But in this
<br>
case they anchor copies of the protein rotor on surfaces. They then
<br>
fuse tiny metal bars to the top of the shaft, creating what looks like
<br>
a nanoscale version of a helicopter blade that rotates when it's fed
<br>
ATP.
<br>
<p>To set these minichoppers spinning, Montemagno and his colleagues
<br>
normally just spike a solution by covering them with ATP. But if
<br>
nanomachines are ever to have a more independent future, researchers
<br>
will need simpler ways of providing them with energy. So Gust recently
<br>
teamed up with Montemagno to supply the ATP-generating liposomes. By
<br>
merely adding them to the nanocopter solution and then shining light
<br>
on them, the researchers showed that they could set the blades
<br>
spinning. Michael Therien, a chemist at the University of Pennsylvania
<br>
in Philadelphia, says he's impressed with the work. &quot;It's a first step
<br>
to a purely engineered system&quot; of nanomachines that can work without
<br>
human intervention, he says.
<br>
<p>Gust has also begun teaming up with Viola Vogel and colleagues at the
<br>
University of Washington, Seattle, to help power a series of
<br>
nanoshuttles that also make use of ATP-driven biological motors to do
<br>
the work.  Finally, Gust's team has adapted its artificial
<br>
photosynthesis scheme to do what plants do best: convert CO2 into more
<br>
complex molecules. At the ACS meeting, Gust reported that his team can
<br>
start with a compound called pyruvate and add the carbon from a CO2
<br>
molecule to make oxaloacetate. Gust believes he and his team may
<br>
eventually be able to coax their tiny refineries to regenerate complex
<br>
hydrocarbons such as those found in gasoline from simple sunlight and
<br>
CO2. If so, nanorefineries may one day be the key to powering both the
<br>
nanoworld and the world at large.
