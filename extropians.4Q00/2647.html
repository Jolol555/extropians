<p>How could you *possibly* know that?
<br>
<p>Hazarded a guess, did you?  Good.  In my language, we call that
<br>
belief, and it is true by definition (in my language) that you believe
<br>
it to be true.
<br>
<p>Speak in my language.  The flaws you see are artifacts of the
<br>
logos-logic in which you think.  Of all the realities, of all the
<br>
conceptual schemes, in all the gin joints in all the world, why'd you
<br>
pick THAT one?
<br>
<p>Hey, whaddya know!  That's the same reason I picked mine.
<br>
<p>That's solidarity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From now on, whenever somebody says the word &quot;objectivity,&quot; you and I
</em><br>
will pretend they're saying &quot;solidarity.&quot;  Whenever somebody says
<br>
&quot;absolute truth,&quot; we'll pretend they're saying &quot;beliefs we share.&quot;
<br>
Share your beliefs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the end, it's all just opinion.  There is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no truth unless it is created, and no laws except the ones we impose.
</em><br>
<p>In an earlier post on relativism, I presented you with two arguments
<br>
against relativism.  One of them was traditional.  The other was a
<br>
newer Wittgensteinian argument.
<br>
<p>Did those arguments make sense to you?  What's wrong with them on your
<br>
terms?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Fantasy is merely reality without inhibitions.  As for being a &quot;walking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vapor-person&quot;, I seem to be more aware of the nature of life than the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I seem to meet and work with every day, who actually think that they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplishing something!  Or that, perhaps, they are right about something!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet, I'm afraid, everyone is wrong.  Everyone is, essentially, a walking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corpse, a doomed machine thinking that they actually have this fiction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called &quot;free will&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Heh.  Can of worms, but I don't think we have free will.  Doesn't
<br>
bother me.  Ever read any Nietzsche?  Any Sartre?  Any Kant?  These
<br>
people were thinking about how people can make a free choice in a
<br>
world fully determined by law and chance, where &quot;free will&quot; is not
<br>
present in the World-in-itself.  They had some interesting results.
<br>
Do you know what they are?
<br>
<p>Or are you too self-absorbed to read even the most famous philosophers
<br>
nearest to your own beliefs?  Have you got it all figured out?  That's
<br>
no relativism.  That's ethnocentrism, like I was suggesting.  [I KNEW
<br>
you'd come around! ;)]  But where's the open-mindedness?
<br>
<p>Relativism is nonsense; if it serves any use, it's theraputic.  But
<br>
you don't seem to have actually benefitted from the therapy.  The
<br>
outcome was supposed to be open-mindedness.  (In my language, being
<br>
rational is to be adequately open-minded, by definition.)  What
<br>
happened?
<br>
<p>There IS a revolution to be had.  It's a revolution against
<br>
relativism.  You think you figured relativism out all by yourself?
<br>
You're wrong.  (No free will, remember?  There are no new ideas,
<br>
remember?)  It surrounds you.  It pervades.  It was forced on you.
<br>
You think you don't know anyone who believes like you?  All of your
<br>
liberal friends are like that, but they won't admit it.  (All of mine
<br>
are.  They've told me everything and exactly what you tell me about
<br>
yourself.)
<br>
<p>To revolt is to take our beliefs into our own hands.  Relativism is
<br>
taking everyone else's beliefs at face value.  But the real revolution
<br>
is in holding beliefs of our own, by ourselves, and rejecting the
<br>
false beliefs of others.  We stand up for ourselves.  Now, dust
<br>
yourself off and let's get on with it.
