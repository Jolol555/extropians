The idea that some will go on towards Singularity (or whatever) and
<br>
the rest will remain, is of course one of the main Scary Arguments
<br>
Against the Singularity (cf. Stuart Brand, _The Clock of the Long Now_
<br>
and Jaron Lanier's edge piece). Exponential growth might also imply
<br>
exponential growth of differences, and this is generally viewed as a
<br>
bad thing. After lecturing some first year students on waguely
<br>
transhumanism related stuff, I noticed this was one of the arguments
<br>
against it that seemed to work best. Well worth considering.
<br>
<p>The problem is relevant not just for the Singularity but any knowledge
<br>
economy: if there are no strong rules against changing social class,
<br>
but doing so depends merely on an act of will/ambition/ability, the
<br>
resulting situation will still have some who due to their own values,
<br>
passivity, culture or whatever remain down. The door is open, but they
<br>
either think it is closed, to hard to get past or that remaining is
<br>
good. The problem with this division is that it cannot be redressed
<br>
using traditional means like redistributing money or rights, but would
<br>
need some ways of redistributing or improving ambition (the later
<br>
might actually be doable, by creating a more practically optimist
<br>
social atmosphere). And even then we would have the people who do not
<br>
wish to rise to the heavens.
<br>
<p>Ethically, I would say transhumanism values diversity and individual
<br>
development. But it is not based on some narrow definition of linear
<br>
progress - we are a bit too postmodern for that - so what kind of
<br>
individual development is desirable is in the end up to the individual
<br>
to make a decision about. A bit like the subjective optimality
<br>
definition of health in Freita's _Nanomedicine_. Now, as I see this,
<br>
when applied to the incomplete singularity scenario, this leads to the
<br>
conclusion that it is completely OK to decide not to join in due to
<br>
one's value system. In fact, it increases the diversity of
<br>
humanity. 
<br>
<p>What might happen is of course that the posthumans (or people of the
<br>
new economy or whatever) want to make sure people staying behind do
<br>
this due to their own values as a rational decision, rather than just
<br>
due to mistaken information, habit or something else. Hence they will
<br>
want to give an unbiased image of what they are missing out on (here I
<br>
will just assume ethical posthumans; posthumans with an ideological
<br>
axe to grind is another matter of course). Education becomes very
<br>
relevant.
