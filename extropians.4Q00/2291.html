<em>&gt; PROBLEM: The media may have influenced the outcome of the vote.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SOLUTION: Ban all media from polling places, ban all media        
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           discussion of election results till all polls have      
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           closed.
</em><br>
<p>Isn't the notion of the &quot;media&quot; becoming obsolete in this day of user to
<br>
user communications?  I don't think we can usefully distinguish between
<br>
the media and ordinary people, when anyone can publish and share his
<br>
observations via the Internet.
<br>
<p>I would not support banning discussion of elections by individuals.  In
<br>
the first place such a limitation would be almost impossible to enforce.
<br>
In the second place it sets a precedent for further erosion of freedom
<br>
of speech, one of the most important principles in guaranteeing freedom.
<br>
<p>Ultimately the question is whether to try to limit the flow of
<br>
information.  It's true that people's behavior may change if they know
<br>
more about what is going on, including how people are voting during the
<br>
course of election day.  But IMO we have to accept this kind of change.
<br>
<p>Giving people more information will make many changes in society.
<br>
Many of them are good, some of them are potentially bad (at least for
<br>
some groups).  We have to learn to live with a highly informed society,
<br>
rather than fighting this change.
