</em><br>
<p>Quite possibly. Could it also be that the Montanan and Hampshirite share
<br>
more common values, or think they do? Sure. I know what you are driving
<br>
at, but note that you said &quot;easier&quot;. Not &quot;a slam dunk&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do freak petty socio/communo-fascists all the time.
</em><br>
<p>OK, let's take two extreme examples of individualism, then something
<br>
that happened to me a couple years back: 
<br>
<p>1) Flash or print a concealed weapon in New Mexico, one of those rural
<br>
places you and I both tend to like. Get arrested. Resist arrest and
<br>
escape, claiming that your constitutional rights are being violated.
<br>
Return to your home. Wait for the SWAT team and negotiators. I am not
<br>
saying it's right, I am saying it happens; at some point, if you act
<br>
&quot;weird&quot; enough, you will be presumed to be a danger to others and you
<br>
will be called a wacko. Even in Ojai.
<br>
<p>2) After getting all proper permits for a public event from your local
<br>
socio/communo-fascists, undertake to perform a blood animal sacrifice of
<br>
some medium-sized animal in your local (small) town square. Invite the
<br>
media. Invoke Cthulhu, and call for the destruction of all that
<br>
Christians value. Paint your self with and drink the blood, and offer it
<br>
to children to do the same. Still covered in blood, go to various
<br>
merchants offering the blood for wholesale as a miracle cure for
<br>
Christianity. Wait for results. You might not be committed, but I
<br>
ga-ron-tee that the word &quot;crazy&quot; will be applied by some people.
<br>
<p>You were just being an individual; in the latter case, it was just
<br>
performance art. What is their problem?
<br>
<p>I agree that is seems to be harder to freak country folk, at least
<br>
superficially: &quot;Oh, that's just Jeb. Don't mind ol' Jeb, he just got
<br>
some WAYS about him.&quot; These people are talking about someone they have
<br>
known from birth.
<br>
<p>You say you wouldn't do either of those things? Hey! Hel-looooo, shared
<br>
values!
<br>
<p>3) But if you walk into a small community diner as a total unknown,
<br>
wearing no pants and a parka that doesn't quite cover what other people
<br>
wish it did, after being up in the hill country where there ain't nobody
<br>
to care and you plumb forgot, plus you thought you *were* figleafed,
<br>
expect to be treated as a potential loony. I speak from personal
<br>
experience. Luckily, I was able to get congruent quickly enough that I
<br>
was just invited to never return to that establishment. By about three
<br>
CHiPpies. And the waitress did not look happy, either.
<br>
<p>But hell, Mount Shasta Village is just as bad as NYC, right?
<br>
<p>:)
