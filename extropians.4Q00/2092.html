<em>&gt; Subject: Ghost in the Machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sometimes, studying neuroscience and working in a lab, I get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mired in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; minutia, and sort of lose faith.  Then I read something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; galvanizes my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resolve.  Goedel, Escher, Bach was one.  Anything by Damasio works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dennet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is pretty good, too.  This article was another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've been rather disappointed by Damasio's works.  No matter what the man
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempts to explain through his adherence to physicalism, he is still left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without any explanation for why we can function as independent beings, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the true root of consciousness is.
</em><br>
<p>His tri-partite model of consciousness is an interesting bridge between
<br>
&quot;conscious&quot; and &quot;non-conscious,&quot; while backing it up with clinical cases
<br>
which are manifestations of the state.  He ties conscious into biological
<br>
systems, such as those for memory and somato-sensory systems.
<br>
<p>He explains nothing that hasn't
<br>
<em>&gt; already been determined,
</em><br>
<p>Except for his own extremely prolific body of research,
<br>
<p>and adds little to the philosophical dialogue
<br>
<em>&gt; surrounding the concept of consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>Well, he's not a philosopher.  He adds empirical research, and theories
<br>
based on clinical studies, something sorely needed amongst the philosophical
<br>
dialogue.  Philosophers argued for centuries about whether the atom was the
<br>
smallest unit of matter, or able to be split, until a scientist went ahead
<br>
and split it.
<br>
<p>Even the idea that all
<br>
<em>&gt; subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience can be empirically measured still breaks down due to the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that reading into the precise meaning of every neural connection and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemical pair would require the interpretation through a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symbolic system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based upon the structure of the brain itself, which would have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by another mind- thus, we can never escape the subjective nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective reality.  Our brain just doesn't work that way.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that Damasio advocates this model in any sense.  Feelings
<br>
aren't interpretations of the body's state in the brain, they are the
<br>
representation of the body's state in the brain, and require no
<br>
interpretation.  Maybe I don't get what you are saying.  Are you saying that
<br>
Damasio's model includes a need for an interpretory body, ala the Cartesian
<br>
Theatre, or what?  I can assure you, it doesn't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dennet's work, &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot;, might better have been titled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Consciousness Explained Away&quot; (To borrow a quote from Ken Wilber's essay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; series &quot;The Eye of Spirit&quot;).  It is an objective, conscious attempt at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denying the existence of consciousness, through denying the validity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective experience.
</em><br>
<p>Or as I like to call it, &quot;Conscious Explained...Sort of, If I haven't Left
<br>
Anything Out, or New Evidence Doesn't Come to Light.&quot;  I don't completely
<br>
buy Dennet's explanation, either, but I do think that his denial of, or
<br>
perhaps just doubt about, the validity of subjective experience is valid,
<br>
and important.  Our brains fool us all the time.  The dots in the color phi
<br>
experiment aren't moving or changing color.  The walls aren't bleeding when
<br>
you are on acid.  Gestalt psychology went out because it relied on
<br>
subjective measures.  We must admit the possibility that our brains are
<br>
creating the perception of a will for an automaton.
<br>
<p>You missed one, though.  GEB doesn't really get at the nature of
<br>
consciousness, either, because it almost completely ignores biology.  Point
<br>
is, I don't expect any of these books to hold up completely to scrutiny or
<br>
new evidence.  They are all flawed, and probably only parts of them will
<br>
stand the test of time and experiment, as is also true for Edelman's
<br>
theories.  What they do for me is offer a synthesis of ideas, letting me
<br>
step back so that I can see the forest for the trees, or at least one
<br>
thinker's idea of what the forest may look like.  When asked a question they
<br>
can't field in a presentation, the grad students from the lab at which I
<br>
work like to say &quot;The brain is complex.&quot;  It is a ridiculous understatement
<br>
that helps us understand the enormous task we have before us.  It galvanizes
<br>
me to see syntheses like those of Hofstadter, Dennet, or Damasio.  If I want
<br>
safe, most likely provable theories, I'll read journals (which I do).  If I
<br>
want to be excited about my studies, I'll settle for a few flaws in an
<br>
over-reaching theory, because it shows the way toward the future of
<br>
neuroscience.
