<em>&gt; To be clear:  Are you also espousing this &quot;Libertarian goals through

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; If so, could you explain a little more in detail about how promoting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the political party that believes in bigger government, higher income 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxes, a de-emphasis on personal property, less personal 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I want to take issue with the implications that Libertarians are
<br>
closer to Republicans than to Democrats.  In my (admittedly limited)
<br>
attendance at Libertarian Party meetings I found people who had come
<br>
to the Libertarian position from both ends of the political spectrum.
<br>
There were as many &quot;liberal&quot; Libertarians who would tell you that
<br>
Republicans are the epitome of evil for their religiously-motivated
<br>
stances against drugs and homosexuality as there were &quot;conservative&quot;
<br>
Libertarians who complain about Democrats as you have done above.
<br>
<p>The fact is, neither party is anywhere close to the Liberatarian position
<br>
and it is pointless to say that Libertarians slumming in the mainstream
<br>
ought to vote Republican rather than Democratic.
