</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have often wondered if maybe there is some genetic switch, much like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;found in Swamp Eels and some frogs with the ability to change gender 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whenever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there are too many of one gender in the population, where in human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;populations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that reach some level of social/population stress will tend to produce more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gay/lesbian members in order to reduce population growth....
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't make sense, from the point of view of an individual collection of 
<br>
genes (person) to have this switch. There's no evolutionary benefit to do 
<br>
what is best for society at large in exchange for what is best for himself 
<br>
(I use &quot;best&quot; here in the purely evolutionary sense). In finding a genetic 
<br>
benefit, ask what is the genetic benefit for a mother or father of having 
<br>
offspring who are homosexual. This is the general route taken by 
<br>
anthropologists/ psychologists, and the explanation centers around the fact 
<br>
that a childless individual is going to have more free time to do whatever, 
<br>
which, in a close-knit-family type of society, this means that having a gay 
<br>
child will lead to less work the other heterosexual offspring, which in 
<br>
theory leads to more grandchildren then if all your children were 
<br>
heterosexual.
<br>
I guess that a gay individual in a close-knit-family society will in fact be 
<br>
contributing to the propogation of his own genes because he shares 50% of 
<br>
his genes with his siblings, if this theory is correct. But I suspect that 
<br>
it is not.. I guess it could be answered empirically by taking a survey of 
<br>
gays and heterosexuals as a control group, and finding out how many nieces 
<br>
and nephews each one has. Of course, the difference would have to be more 
<br>
then double for it to work out to the gay's evolutionary benefit.
<br>
Beginning of a better theory: I've read that women who identify themselves 
<br>
as lesbians (not bisexual, but lesbians) have actually had more sex with 
<br>
more men then women who identify themselves as heterosexual. This is 
<br>
paradoxical, I don't know why it would be like this.  I have not read the 
<br>
equivalent stat for gay males, but I think it wouldn't surprise me to learn 
<br>
that men who consider themselves gay have had sex with more women then have 
<br>
men who consider themselves straight, but (obviously) the number of sexual 
<br>
encounters with the opposite sex would be much less. So if this were true, 
<br>
the evolutionary benefit is easier to figure out, but why would it be like 
<br>
this? Can anyone think of reasons why a homosexual would actually lead to 
<br>
more heterosexual partners then a heterosexual?
<br>
There is the factor that women, generally, have a lot of gay friends, but 
<br>
this as a response is begging the question.
