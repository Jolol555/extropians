<em>&gt; I've heard that investors in electric power companies have a keen interest

<em>&gt; cells, because of associated and potentially devastating long-term impact on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conventional utilities (traditionally attractive stocks to long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investors). Suppose investors, having learned of impending production of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuel cells and the realization of high-temp superconductors, dump their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stock. Has anyone noticed the stock prices of electrical utilities in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; California?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could this have anything to do with power companies whining about not being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to supply enough power, and asking users to cut back on usage? Unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm way too stoned, doesn't this help to explain the bizarre behavior of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies that make money selling electricity, asking people to buy less of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it? Perhaps the big power companies are in trouble, and they know it, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; account of new high-tech methods of generating power. The power companies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't relish broadcasting the news of their impending obsolescence, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neither do their owners. But they do need to let the general public know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that power shortages may (no, shall) occur, until the new technologies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in place. How can they explain that without appearing deceitful, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since none of the new alternatives seems ready to take up the slack?
</em><br>
<p>The state owned utilities are the ones suffering, because the consumer
<br>
(read: activist) controlled utility boards still control rates charged
<br>
to customers of these utilities. What the state is trying to do is fix
<br>
what its suppliers can charge it by fiat, force. Its abject tyranny.
<br>
Customers of these utilities are consuming so much energy because they
<br>
are not paying proper market prices, so demand would obviously outstrip
<br>
supply. Asking welfare addicts to do something nicely typically does not
<br>
do the trick. Jack up their utility bills and you'll quickly find some
<br>
politicans in office who will get things done and solved, i.e. the
<br>
Democrats will be out of office.
