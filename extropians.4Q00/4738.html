<p>&lt;&lt;Technology is adopted for a lot of reasons, but as a rule I think it
<br>
is adopted because it gives some benefit. Not necessarily to the
<br>
people as a whole, and sometimes at the expense of one factor (such as
<br>
farming providing more and more reliable food than hunting, but at the
<br>
expense of a lot of labor). &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>There was an interesting book published in the 1980's titled PALEOPATHOLOGY 
<br>
AT THE ORIGINS OF AGRICULTURE. It was a collection of articles from various 
<br>
academic journals which focused on evidence that human health declined 
<br>
significantly with the advent of the agricultural lifestyle. It's been 
<br>
years since I read it, but as I recall the evidence consisted of teeth (far 
<br>
greater incidence of dental caries after ag. was adopted than before), 
<br>
length of leg bones (bones longer before than after indicating greater 
<br>
height), age (more old people pre-ag). Naturally the evidence is scanty, 
<br>
being from so long ago, but there was enough there to make you question the 
<br>
benefits of the agricultural lifestyle.
<br>
<p>Agriculture must be distinguished from what's known as &quot;incipient 
<br>
horticulture&quot; in which gardening and gathering are both practiced. The 
<br>
latter is the method of food production I've used for the past 6 years up 
<br>
until mid-2000 when the drought here was so severe that there was very 
<br>
little plant food available (and many animals were dying or leaving as 
<br>
well)--if I hadn't been able to go to the grocery store and buy food I 
<br>
would have had to move.  However, if I'd already built the cisterns to hold 
<br>
my goal of 35,000 gallons, I would've been fine. Using gardening in 
<br>
conjunction with gathering (and also keeping a few  semi-feral chickens, 
<br>
goats, and rabbits) I could take care of my food needs in an hour or two a 
<br>
day (during some parts of the year I'd spend more time, during other parts, 
<br>
less).  I might actually spend 3 or 4 or even 5 hours out in the garden, 
<br>
but much of the time was spent looking at interesting things, cultivating 
<br>
ornamental plants, or resting.  It's not at all a bad life, one of the best 
<br>
parts of it being that it leaves plenty of time for thinking, learning, 
<br>
appreciating and producing art works, inventing, producing, and 
<br>
appreciating technological works.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My view too - I love civilisation with its complex, intertwined and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wonderous systems that make it possible for me to listen to Beethoven
</em><br>
<em>&gt;while communicating with similar minds halfway across the world, eat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;delicious fruits out of season and watch the snow settle outside my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;window while I'm warm and cozy. That is something well worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;defending.
</em><br>
<p>I would never want to live in an old-style hunter-gatherer society. I too 
<br>
love the range of music, literature, and visual arts that are available to 
<br>
me, love the Internet, the excitement of visiting cities, the intellectual 
<br>
stimulation of studying various fields of science, supplementing the 
<br>
empirical research I do in my own garden with theory from across time &amp; 
<br>
space. I prefer to eat fresh local fruits and veggies in season, but I'm 
<br>
very happy to have access to modern medicine and aircraft. The idea that 
<br>
&quot;conventional&quot; agriculture is necessary for &quot;feeding the world&quot; is false. I 
<br>
hope that in the future more people will realize this.
