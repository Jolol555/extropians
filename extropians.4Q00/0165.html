<em>&gt; &quot;I doubt anyone would dispute that eating right, proper exercise and

sleeping
<br>
<em>&gt; in one's own bed really does result in longer life.  Our challenge is to

figure
<br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've just about given up on the sacrifices, especially the exercise.
</em><br>
<p>I think the thing to do is find activities that give one the exercize while
<br>
being fun in themselves.  For example, I like to hike and roller blade.  I
<br>
do not like to pump iron.  So, I do the former a lot in hopes this will make
<br>
up for not doing traditional exercizes.  (It's not laziness with me, just
<br>
boredom.)  Along these lines, there are many activities which can do this --
<br>
walking, biking, various sports (tennis, swimming, volley ball).
<br>
<p>I wonder about the level of health on this list.  How often do members get
<br>
check ups?  have their blood tested?  How many are on healthy diets?  not
<br>
overweight?  take supplements?  One would hope people who are interested in
<br>
maximum lifespans are doing this more than the rest of the population, but
<br>
from the few people I've met over the years -- admittedly, not a good
<br>
sample, since it is small and extemely biased:) -- it seems like it's more
<br>
talk than action.
<br>
<p>This is sad, since lots of nontraumatic, preventable things can kill NOW,
<br>
such as heart disease and certain other easily prevented diseases.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
