It appears as if Emlyn &lt;<a href="mailto:emlyn@one.net.au?Subject=Re:%20Why%20would%20AI%20want%20to%20be%20friendly?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200010021000.MAA07184@color.sics.se&gt;">emlyn@one.net.au</a>&gt; wrote:

<br>

<br>

<br>
<p>Since I remember stuff from around the age three months, I beg to differ
<br>
on your assumption that &quot;you can't grok your 3-month old self&quot;.
<br>
<p>OTOH, the 3-month old cannot easily grok the world of grown-ups.
<br>
<p>|I wonder if we can't remember what it was like to be that age, because the
<br>
|points of view of an adult and a 3-month old are so disparate; maybe there
<br>
|is just no way to model what it is like to be 3 months old, so you lose the
<br>
|information, save for the odd, mostly untrustworthy, flash or vision.
<br>
<p>I know much more now, and have much longer legs now, but the person *I* am
<br>
is very much the same, interested in knowing all things.
