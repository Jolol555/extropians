<p><em>&gt; You're a bit out of touch with Mom Logic, aren't you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that's not the real reason - keeping &quot;atheism&quot; out of the subject
</em><br>
lines
<br>
<em>&gt; would be a major and unusual inconvenience and it really would border on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Family Correctness, like trying to keep message bodies clean.  Keeping the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject lines PG-13 is just ordinary netiquette, if you ask me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Or your mom's logic was different.  I know when shows came on or something
<br>
with women in lingerie I would get yelled at, but there was always &quot;it's
<br>
not my fault&quot; or when my friends took to on-line porn, my parents didn't
<br>
want to acknowledge it as many conservative parents have acted post sexual
<br>
revolution.
<br>
However, atheism is synonimous with satanism in a catholic/god-fearing
<br>
family, and even in some non-religious families.  Were I to have ever been
<br>
caught challenging their religion...  Same thing goes with politics.
<br>
Trying to read Mein Kampf, or the Communist Mannifesto?  Luckily I could
<br>
pretend it was for Euro history and they'd go after the school =P.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; - and be honest with your parents if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are looking over your shoulder
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...but *this* idea - Nadia, what planet did you grow up on?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree here.  Be honest with them only if they can handle it.  Otherwise,
<br>
one need have no responsibility to his/her parents.  They didn't choose to
<br>
be brought into the world in that family.  So reward them for
<br>
intelligence, and punish them for thier ignorances.
<br>
