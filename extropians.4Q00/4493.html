<p>I at one point did three full-time programs and one half-time program 
<br>
concurrently. I was often told that this was impossible. Ironically, I 
<br>
think it was because everybody said it was impossible that it became 
<br>
possible for me! I was energized by a passionate desire to prove that the 
<br>
egalitarian presumptions in Sweden (where I did my undergraduate education) 
<br>
were false.
<br>
<p>I obtained enough background in computational neuroscience, mathematical 
<br>
logic, physics and philosophy to start a PhD in any of them. So why did I 
<br>
choose philosophy of science? Because I figured that when you do a PhD in 
<br>
one of the sciences, you usually have to specialize very heavily in one 
<br>
narrow area, whereas doing philosophy of science gives you more freedom to 
<br>
pick the most interesting bits from several different fields and to get an 
<br>
overview of the scientific edifice. To a considerable degree it actually 
<br>
worked out that way for me. :-)

<p>I have to say I'm not such a great fan of the 
<br>
philosophy-will-teach-you-how-to-live approach.
<br>
<p>But there are areas of philosophy where real progress is possible, and some 
<br>
of these areas address important issues. The first thing to understand 
<br>
about philosophy is that it is a very big cup of tea - if you dive in at 
<br>
the wrong place, you can get a bad first impression, and you might never 
<br>
reach the interesting stuff. I always find myself in a difficult position 
<br>
when I'm supposed to defend Philosophy against the usual criticisms, 
<br>
because to a very large extent I agree with them! But then I want to say 
<br>
that there are parts of philosophy which should be excepted.
<br>
<p>The philosophy that I'm interested in is continuous with science. There is 
<br>
no sharp distinction; philosophy just tends to deal with the broader 
<br>
issues, and with problems that haven't yet been clarified to the point 
<br>
where the standard scientific techniques can be applied.
<br>
<p>Moreover, I'm mostly interested in those problems the solution of which 
<br>
might have practical benefits within a few decades (after which 
<br>
superintelligences might be better able to tackle any remaining questions 
<br>
much better than we can now). It's true that this attitude is very atypical 
<br>
of academic philosophers.
<br>
<p>So what problems of philosophy can potentially have such practical 
<br>
relevance? Well, there's the foundations of probability theory - and my 
<br>
theory of observational selection effects 
<br>
(<a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com">http://www.anthropic-principle.com</a>), which can provide methodological 
<br>
tools to address questions in cosmology, evolution theory, game theoretic 
<br>
problems involving imperfect recall, whether there are other intelligent 
<br>
civilizations in the universe, the future prospects of our own 
<br>
civilization, whether there's evidence for the hypothesis that our world 
<br>
was designed (perhaps by a posthuman civilization emulating our world on a 
<br>
computer), and other such fascinating issues. Then, of course, there are 
<br>
various ethical questions, the foundations of social choice theory, and 
<br>
welfare economics. Many topics there that are of direct relevance to our 
<br>
transhumanist ambitions.
<br>
<p>In general, it seems to me that a philosophy position is at least as good a 
<br>
base as any other for addressing the big questions about where we are and 
<br>
where we're going - the sort of questions that we are constantly discussing 
<br>
on this list. Of course, philosophy by itself impotent. But when mixed with 
<br>
a deep understanding of several scientific fields (including economics!) 
<br>
and emerging technologies, you get a potentially explosive compound.
