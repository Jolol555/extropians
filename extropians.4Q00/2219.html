<em>&gt; I just digested the Matrix movie via DVD last night. It was visually
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>Sure.  And humans would have been aware that scorching the atmosphere
<br>
was a dumb way of robbing the AI of power and much more destructive to
<br>
biologicals than to AI.  It would be much easier for the AI to tap
<br>
geothermal, go nuclear, get enough off-planet presence to grab solar
<br>
from space and so on. 
<br>
<p>I assumed it was a silly explanation for something else.  Like maybe the
<br>
AIs knew or had a suspicion that the humans were capable of some feat
<br>
which they could not master and sought to simply keep enough humans
<br>
alive despite their gross stupidity in scorching their own atmosphere to
<br>
hopefully some day end up with one human that could do this extra
<br>
something of other.  I also have a suspicion that the Oracle is an AI
<br>
and a special purpose one to search for and encourage the appearance of
<br>
this human.  Notice, they end up with a human who is throughly at home
<br>
in and master of the AI/VR space and yet fully human and committed to
<br>
humanity.  Not a bad resolution to a nasty conflict.
<br>
<p>Another possibility is that humans became so addicted to VR that that
<br>
addiction created the need for the pods and increasingly sophisticated
<br>
AI body sitters.  A story had to be entered into the collective VR that
<br>
would enable humans to escape their own self-induced tightly
<br>
inter-locking fantasy world.  The AIs were as caught in the trap as the
<br>
humans.  Most thought they had to continue the VR as it was.  That it
<br>
was their duty or prime-directive or whatever.  A handful sought an end
<br>
to the stalemate stifling both humans and AI.
