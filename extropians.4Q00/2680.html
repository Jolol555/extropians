Apropos the view of the brain as a Darwininan machine, as
<br>
espoused by Gerald M. Edelman and others, I thought I'd
<br>
mention a book with a similar theme which I ran across
<br>
recently: _Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge_ by
<br>
Henry C. Plotkin, 1993, Harvard University Press (paperback
<br>
edition, 269 pages; see
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674192818/qid=974465462/sr=1-2/107-6292930-3771726">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674192818/qid=974465462/sr=1-2/107-6292930-3771726</a>
<br>
The author is described on the book jacket as a professor of
<br>
psychobiology at University College in London.
<br>
<p>I found that this book complemented my earlier reading of
<br>
Edelman (see
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465013767/o/qid=974464826/sr=2-1/107-6292930-3771726">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465013767/o/qid=974464826/sr=2-1/107-6292930-3771726</a>
<br>
and
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465007643/qid%3D974464955/107-6292930-3771726">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465007643/qid%3D974464955/107-6292930-3771726</a>
<br>
and see also my earlier remarks about Edelman at
<br>
<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q00/date56.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q00/date56.html</a>
<br>
[search down the page for &quot;A Spring-Powered Theory of
<br>
Consciousness&quot;]).  Whereas Edelman concentrates mainly on
<br>
neuronanatomy and the embryogenesis, development, and
<br>
architecture of the brain as the physical substrate of what
<br>
he calls &quot;primary consciousness&quot;, the details of which he
<br>
describes in selectionist terms, Plotkin is concerned more
<br>
with theoretical considerations of Darwininan evolution as a
<br>
mechanism for matching biological organisms to a world which
<br>
manifests fluctuations and stabilities on many different
<br>
time scales -- in other words, a mechanism of adaptation.
<br>
<p>Plotkin describes the efforts which have been made to
<br>
generalize &quot;classical&quot; Darwinism (or neo-Darwinism, as it
<br>
became when fused in the 20th century with Mendelian
<br>
genetics), whose proper domain is the change over time of
<br>
biological species (driven by a two-stage process &quot;with
<br>
genetics as the principal engine of variation and selection
<br>
acting mainly upon the phenotype&quot; [p. 46]) to a more
<br>
abstract, encompassing theory which can be used to account
<br>
for variation over time **within** individual organisms as
<br>
well as that **between** individuals.  As does Edelman,
<br>
Plotkin points to the immune system as a solidly
<br>
uncontroversial example of intra-organismic change which is
<br>
universally acknowledged (the author claims) to occur by a
<br>
process analogous to that of classical Darwinian selection
<br>
among individuals.
<br>
<p>To eliminate the analogical or metaphorical aspects of this
<br>
characterization, Plotkin calls upon what he names
<br>
&quot;universal Darwinism&quot; (see Chapter 3), a term which Richard
<br>
Dawkins originated, and which was intended by him to
<br>
indicate that &quot;such processes are not bound to life on Earth
<br>
but are the same wherever adaptation and/or speciation are
<br>
occurring or have occurred anywhere in the universe&quot;
<br>
(p. 60).  Plotkin, however, alters the sense of this phrase
<br>
to indicate that &quot;it isn't only adaptation and speciation as
<br>
conventionally understood that are driven by these
<br>
processes, but that here on Earth certain other forms of
<br>
transformation of living systems are also caused by these
<br>
same processes&quot; (p. 60).
<br>
<p>Plotkin describes several different approaches to a
<br>
generalized Darwinian theory, one of which he calls the
<br>
&quot;g-t-r heuristic&quot; (g-t-r standing for
<br>
&quot;generate-test-regenerate&quot;), which the author derives from
<br>
the work of American biologist Richard C. Lewontin and
<br>
American psychologist Donald T. Campbell, and another of
<br>
which is the RIL (&quot;replicator-interactor-lineage&quot;)
<br>
formulation of universal Darwinism, which Plotkin derives
<br>
from the work of Richard Dawkins and American philosopher of
<br>
biology David L.  Hull.  In addition to these scholars,
<br>
Plotkin credits a number of others who have produced work
<br>
along these lines, including philosopher of science Karl
<br>
Popper, sociologist Georg Simmel, physicist Ernst Mach,
<br>
ethologist Konrad Lorenz, psychologist B. F. Skinner, and
<br>
economist H. A. Simon (see p. 70).  I suggest that anybody
<br>
who is interested in this subject also perform a Google
<br>
search on the phrase &quot;evolutionary epistemology&quot;.
<br>
<p>The primary thrust of the book, of course, is to explore the
<br>
applicability of some form of generalized Darwinian theory
<br>
to the characterization learning and intelligence in humans
<br>
and other animals with nervous systems as a &quot;secondary
<br>
heuristic&quot; of adaptation, working within the lifetime of the
<br>
individual and subsidiary to the &quot;primary heuristic&quot; which
<br>
has shaped the individual's phenotype.  The following
<br>
quotes, which I have selected to give the flavor of the
<br>
author's arguments, are from the central chapter of the book
<br>
-- Chapter 5 &quot;The Evolution of Intelligence&quot;:
<br>
<p>p. 137
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The] period of time between receiving a set of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genetic instructions and their implementation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through development to the point where those
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selfsame instructions might be returned, via
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reproduction, to the gene pool, has been given a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;variety of names...  Konrad Lorenz... called it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generational deadtime.  It is a lag-time that is an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invariant feature of any system whose construction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;takes time and which is based on a set of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructions that cannot be continually updated.  In
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the case of sexually reproducing organisms, each
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organism is cast off and cut off from the gene pool
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a fixed set of instructions that cannot be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;altered.  It cannot &quot;dip&quot; back into the gene pool to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;augment these instructions if it finds they are not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good enough.  In this sense, genetically, it is on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its own.
<br>
<p>p. 144
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncertain futures problem concerns an organism
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going through life, equipped only with instructions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given at conception (and hence perhaps only correct
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at that time) on how to survive, and having to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interact with a world that may be different from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that in which its life began.  There are, of course,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two possible outcomes -- the problem is solved or it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not...  Extinction is always caused by an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inability to cope with the uncertain futures
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem, and given the estimates that well in excess
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of 98 per cent of all species that have ever existed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are now extinct, it is clear that, in the end, all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life succumbs to its uncertain future...  None the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less, [the] struggle to delay the inevitable
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;succumbing can be relatively successful.  There are,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after all, species that have existed for millions of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years.
<br>
<p>p. 145
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[One way] for an organism to reduce the amount of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;significant change it has to deal with... is to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reduce the period of time between conception and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reproductive competence...  This means that the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ratio of life-span length to numbers of offspring is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;low...  This is a characteristic 'life-style' of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animals known to ecologists as r-strategists...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These r-strategists usually live less than one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year...; they develop rapidly; they are usually of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small body size; and they normally reproduce over
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just a single period.  This is the life-history
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strategy common to most invertebrate animals and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clearly one that is... relatively successful...
<br>
<p>p. 146
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[A] second very general way of dealing with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change... [is to] change the phenotypes so they can
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change with and match the changing features of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world.  This, in turn, comprises two general
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strategies.  The one results in changes between
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phenotypes, and relies on the chance or radical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;component of the primary heuristic [the mechanism of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classical Darwinian evolution, involving genetic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;variation and selection among competing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phenotypes]...  [Large] numbers of offspring are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;produced,... each...  different from the others...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r-strategists... often do combine a short life-span
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a quite prominent radical component of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;primary heuristic...
<br>
<p>p. 147
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another... strategy is to match change with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change... by giving rise to change **within**
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phenotypes...  I will call this the tracking option.
<br>
<p>p. 149
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can such changes be tracked?  The only way to do
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is to evolve tracking devices whose own states
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be altered and held in that altered condition
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the same period of time as the features of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world which they are tracking...  Such tracking
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devices would be set in place by the usual
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evolutionary processes of the primary heuristic and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hence would operate within certain limits...  These
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;additional knowledge-gaining devices comprise a...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;secondary... heuristic.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...[T]here are two such classes of semi-autonomous
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge-gaining devices or secondary heuristics
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that can track change in this way.  The immune
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system is one; the intelligence mechanisms of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brain are the other.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Think of the world as comprising sets of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;features, some unchanging and others changing at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different rates and with different degrees of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regularity...  [I]f the frequency of change is less
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than that set by generational deadtime for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extracting genetic instructions from the gene pool
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then returning them to it, then the conservative
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;component of the primary heuristic will be able to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'see' these changes and will furnish adaptatons to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;match them.  But if the frequency of change is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faster than the frequency set by generational
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deadtime, then though the primary heuristic will be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;able to see the long-term stabilities upon which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these changes are superimposed and will be able to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detect the margin within which these more rapid
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changes occur, in order to track the precise values
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of these changes the primary heuristic will have to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evolve devices that operate at a much higher
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frequency -- at a frequency high enough to be able
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to track these values.  If the high-frequency
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changes are unstable,...  the tracking
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;device... need [only] command an immediate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compensatory response...  However, if these
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changes... [are] short-term stabilities, then these
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tracking devices must comprise a secondary heuristic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is able to change and maintain new states that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;match those features of the world that are being
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tracked.  Such brain mechanisms...  are what we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know... as rationality or intelligence.
<br>
<p>p. 151
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the kinds of animals that would evolve
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intelligent adaptations are relatively long-lived
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and produce relatively few offspring in their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lifetime; that is, the ratio between the length of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life and number of offspring is high.  Such animals
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;usually develop quite slowly and have a relatively
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;large body size.  They are what ecologists refer to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as k-strategists...
<br>
<p>p. 166
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What might [the] process be by which the secondary
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heuristic of intelligence gains knowledge?  There
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are only two candidates...  selection and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruction, corresponding to Darwinian and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamarckian theories of evolution respectively.  The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;principal difference between them is that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selectionism involves an over-proliferation of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entities, the generation of which is unconnected
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the organism's need at the time (which is why
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the process is sometimes referred to as blind); a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small number of them are conserved after they have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been tested against the organism's requirements...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructionalism, on the other hand, involves the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;production of an entity, a product of intelligence,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the need for it has arisen (which is why the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;process is considered to be directed); this process
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requires a malleable substrate that is moulded into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an adaptive state by the environmental feature that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forms the external end of the relationship.  Put
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crudely, in the case of instruction the environment
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rules; in the case of selection, internal or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organismic states lead.
<br>
<p>p. 169
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[R]ight now we do not know how the brain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[works]... in... sufficient detail...  to be able to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say... whether it works in a selectional or an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructional manner.  Traditionally, the technical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neuroscience literature has been based primarily
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon instructionalist theory.  However, in the last
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twenty years or so, elegant and powerful theorizing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the likes of Jean-Pierre Changeux in France and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerald Edelman in the United States has shown that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selectionist models of brain development and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function are both plausible... and interesting...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, in terms of... brain states, might correspond
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the replicators, interactors, and lineages of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;secondary heuristic?...  A replicator is a pattern
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of activity in a nerve sheet... and corresponds to a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;memory...  [T]he pattern of activity that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constitutes [a] memory... is not always present --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is usually a potential pattern rather than one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is actually present.  This is just another way
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of saying what we all know to be the case, that we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not live with all of our memories activated all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the time.  But they can be re-constituted,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;re-membered, re-plicated...  Memories **are**
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replicators.  They are the secondary brain heuristic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;analogues of genes...  in the sense that memories
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are produced again and again as copies each time
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the brain state in question is reconstituted --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is, each time we conjure up some specific
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;memory.
<br>
<p>p. 171
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[W]hy should the brain be seen as a Darwinian kind
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of machine rather than as a Lamarckian machine?...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forced to take sides,... there are two... reasons
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for choosing the selectionist camp.  One is the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem of creativity...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence... involves... the production of novel
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;solutions to the problems posed by change --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;solutions that are not directly given in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experienced world...  Such creativity cannot occur
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if change is slavishly tracked by instructionalist
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devices.  So what we see here is that while
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selection can mimic instruction, the reverse is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never true...  Instructional intelligence comprises
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only what has been actually experienced...  Indeed,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to D. T. Campbell, the father of modern
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evolutionary epistemology, selectional processes are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;required for the acquisition of any truly new
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge about the world: 'In going beyond what is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;already known, one cannot but go blindly.  If one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goes wisely, this indicates already achieved wisdom
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of some general sort.'  Instruction is never blind.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection always has an element...  of blindness in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it.  At the heart of all creative intelligence is a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selectional process, no matter how many
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructional processes are built on top of it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The [other] reason for choosing selection over
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruction is one of parsimony and simplicity.  If
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the primary heuristic works by selectional
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;processes, which it most certainly does,... and if
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that other embodiment of the secondary heuristic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that deals with our uncertain chemical futures,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;namely the immune system, works by selectional
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;processes, which is now universally agreed, then why
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should one be so perverse as to back a different
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horse when it comes to intelligence?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nested hierarchy of selectional processes is a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simple and elegant conception of the nature of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge.  There will have to be good empirical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasons for abandoning it.

<br>
(which Max More provided the link to in his earlier
<br>
message), suggests that interpreting the mechanisms of
<br>
learning and intelligence in the brain in Darwinian terms is
<br>
a &quot;metaphor&quot;, and quotes to that effect Dr. Terrence
<br>
Sejnowski, director of the Computational Neurobiology
<br>
Laboratory at the Salk Institute: &quot;But the Darwin metaphor
<br>
for the brain is limited, he adds. While Sejnowski doesn't
<br>
deny the scientific support for synaptic plasticity and
<br>
neurogenesis, he thinks the parallel to Darwinism is
<br>
inexact. 'If you want to be strict--if you don't just want
<br>
it to be a literary metaphor--there needs to be a process of
<br>
duplication. You need to take something that is successful,
<br>
make many copies, and mutate it. There's nothing that
<br>
corresponds to that in the brain.'&quot;
<br>
<p>Plotkin's book and other writings on evolutionary
<br>
epistemology are, in effect, an attempt to address
<br>
Sejnowski's dismissal as a mere metaphor the application of
<br>
the adjective &quot;Darwinian&quot; to the operation of the brain.
<br>
The attempt to create a theory of universal Darwinism, as
<br>
Plotkin defines the term, is precisely the attempt to put a
<br>
Darwinian characterization of the brain on a firm
<br>
theoretical foundation.  One gets the impression, however,
<br>
that not all philosophers and scientists are convinced of
<br>
the respectability of this enterprise.  Nevertheless, the
<br>
following remarks in Plotkin's text apply to Sejnowski's
<br>
objections: &quot;[T]he way that evolutionary processes actually
<br>
do occur in the immune system, in the brain or at the level
<br>
of the species is still largely unknown.  But there is no
<br>
reason not to expect considerable differences of detail.
<br>
**The actual mechanisms in each case**, of course -- and one
<br>
cannot repeat this point often enough -- **are entirely
<br>
different**&quot; (Chapter 3 &quot;Universal Darwinism&quot;, p. 100).
<br>
&quot;[A] brain state can be reconstituted when such a state was
<br>
not actually present all the time in the past.  This
<br>
characteristic of neural replication, of making a copy, is
<br>
different from the replication of genes.  In the latter
<br>
case, a specific chemical structure is constantly present
<br>
and, at certain points in the cycle of the interactors
<br>
carrying those genes, copies, literal copies, are made of
<br>
the 'original'.  Clearly neural replication is different.
<br>
Here copies of brain states present some time in the past
<br>
are reconstituted, such structures being only potentially
<br>
present, not actually so, in the intervening time.  How such
<br>
actual brain states are re-established from potential brain
<br>
states is, for the present, a process whose details are
<br>
entirely unknown by brain scientists.  We simply do not know
<br>
how it works&quot; (Chapter 6 &quot;Aspects of Human Knowledge&quot;,
<br>
p. 219).
<br>
<p>In other chapters, Plotkin acknowledges Dawkins' invention
<br>
of the term &quot;meme&quot;, and describes attempts to apply
<br>
universal Darwinism to cultural evolution.  Plotkin admits
<br>
that such attempts are even less precise and more
<br>
speculative than the attempt to characterize learning and
<br>
intelligence as the subsidiary, secondary heuristic in a
<br>
hierarchy of Darwinian evolutionary processes whose primary
<br>
heuristic is the alteration of the phenotype through
<br>
successive generations.  Nevertheless, Plotkin asserts that
<br>
it may someday be theoretically justifiable to characterize
<br>
cultural evolution as a &quot;tertiary heuristic&quot; operating
<br>
subsidiarily to the other two (see p. 225).  Plotkin also
<br>
mentions Karl Popper's characterization of the evolution of
<br>
scientific knowledge in Darwinian terms, and remarks &quot;As
<br>
Popper himself stresses, his view is not meant merely to be
<br>
understood metaphorically.  He means it literally: 'All this
<br>
may be expressed by saying that the growth of our knowledge
<br>
is the result of a process closely resembling what Darwin
<br>
called &quot;natural selection&quot;; that is, **the natural selection
<br>
of hypotheses**...  From the amoeba to Einstein, the growth
<br>
of knowledge is always the same: we try to solve our
<br>
problems, and to obtain, by a process of elimination,
<br>
something approaching adequacy to our tentative solutions.'&quot;
<br>
(pp. 69-70).
<br>
<p>In the final chapter of the book, the author applies the
<br>
evolutionary view of the human capacity for knowledge
<br>
developed in earlier chapters to illuminate the arguments of
<br>
philosophers Immanuel Kant and David Hume.  Kant wrote that
<br>
some knowledge, such as the understanding of mathematical
<br>
relationships and of causality, derives both from
<br>
observation of the world and from built-in intuitions or
<br>
propensities to take advantage of the relevant observations
<br>
-- the so-called a priori synthetic.  Plotkin interprets
<br>
this by bringing to bear the conclusion drawn earlier in the
<br>
book that the human mind is not a tabula rasa, but is
<br>
prepared by the &quot;primary heuristic&quot; of evolution in ways
<br>
that give the &quot;secondary heuristic&quot; a head start, so to
<br>
speak.  People seem to be born into the world knowing, in
<br>
some sense, what it is they need to learn.  Several lines of
<br>
evidence for this priming are presented from experimental
<br>
psychology; linguists, of course, have acknowledged since
<br>
Chomsky that humans are predisposed from birth to learn
<br>
speech with astonishing ease and rapidity.  While Kant
<br>
interpreted this a priori knowledge as a barrier between the
<br>
human intellect and the real world, an evolutionary
<br>
perspective interprets this a priori knowledge as the result
<br>
of human minds having been adapted by evolution to learn
<br>
about the world: the secondary heuristic of intelligence,
<br>
which makes philosophical contemplation and discourse
<br>
possible, owes its existence in the first place to aeons of
<br>
adaptive sculpting by the operation of the primary
<br>
heuristic.
<br>
<p>Scottish philosopher David Hume shocked his contemporaries
<br>
by denying the possibility of certainty; again, in an
<br>
evolutionary interpretation, this is simply a statement of
<br>
the &quot;uncertain futures&quot; problem, a fact about the world
<br>
which makes intellect adaptive in the first place.  In the
<br>
following passage (from Chapter 7 &quot;The Philosophical
<br>
Problems in Perspective&quot;, p. 243), Plotkin alludes to the
<br>
arguments of Hume, who criticized inductive inference
<br>
because the &quot;principal of the uniformity of nature&quot; on which
<br>
it is based is not a logical truth.  This passage also
<br>
contains a capsule summary of Plotkin's view of the
<br>
relationship between inter-organismic and intra-organismic
<br>
evolutionary processes (what are called throughout the book
<br>
the primary and secondary heuristics):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this Humean uncertainty -- Humean
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because modern science can now interpret what the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;philosopher was pointing to as a factual condition
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the universe and not merely a logical point --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nature has come up with an elegant and effective
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response.  Unable to rely upon just one level of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evolution and one unit of selection as the means of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gaining knowledge about just one range of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frequencies of change (that range being limited at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one end by the change becoming undetectably slow to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the point that survival is not threatened by a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;failure to respond to it, and at the other by the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generational deadtime of each species), subsidiary
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evolutionary processes have evolved, each with its
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own units of selection, and each able to gain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge about changes that are occurring at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever-higher frequencies.  So in the real world the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humean uncertainty is converted into a pragmatic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issue of dividing the world into band widths of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frequencies of change and fluctuation, and emplying
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge-gaining mechanisms that are able to match
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rates of perturbation of the world with organic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;structures able to alter their own states at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equivalent rates.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three and a half billion years of life on Earth tell
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us that though individuals, individual species, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole larger groupings of living forms may come and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go precisely because Humean uncertainty can be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;literally fatal, the biotic system as a whole
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endures, being rather adept at solving the problem.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life really is quite good at the knowledge game.
<br>
<p>Since Plotkin mentions Gerald M. Edelman and Jean-Pierre
<br>
Changeux in the same breath, I ordered a book by the
<br>
latter: _L'Homme Neuronal_ (Fayard, 1983).  I have never
<br>
before attempted to read a serious book in French
<br>
(never having gotten much beyond _Le Petit Prince_, and that
<br>
was a long time ago), so I may have bitten off more than I
<br>
can chew.  Nevertheless, I still get a thrill from being
<br>
able to use the Web for international shopping -- I ordered
<br>
the book from a Paris on-line bookstore,
