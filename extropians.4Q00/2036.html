Today, November 7, is the U.S. Presidential election.  A couple of
<br>
comments:
<br>
<p>The Iowa Electronic Markets are real-money futures market where
<br>
players can bet on which candidate will win, shares of the vote, and
<br>
related issues in a number of races, <a href="http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/">http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/</a>.
<br>
This morning's odds show Bush with a 70% chance of winning.
<br>
This figure has been stable over the past week.  See the graph at
<br>
<a href="http://128.255.244.60/graphs/Pres00_WTA.gif">http://128.255.244.60/graphs/Pres00_WTA.gif</a>.
<br>
<p>(Actually this market is just for which candidate wins the popular
<br>
vote totals.  Some have predicted that Bush could win the popular vote
<br>
while Gore could end up as President via the electoral college.)
<br>
<p>The other point I've noted is that Libertarian candidate Harry Browne has
<br>
been getting far more attention this time than in 96.  I've seen him on
<br>
TV several times in recent weeks, and he's been mentioned in a number of
<br>
national polls.  The LA Times ran a voter's guide last week and they had
<br>
five equal-size columns summarizing Presidential candidate positions,
<br>
for Bush, Gore, Nader, Buchanan and Brown.  Squeezed in at the bottom
<br>
were Phillips and Hagelin.  But Browne was up there with the &quot;big boys&quot;.
<br>
<p>Apparently Browne has actually been slightly ahead of Buchanan in some
<br>
national polls.  Since the media have (in their group-think way) decided
<br>
that Buchanan is a respectable national candidate (of course he is a
<br>
media pundit himself), they are somewhat obligated to mention Browne.
<br>
<p>I think also that Nader is helping too, by making low-polling third party
<br>
candidates more credible.  He is a well known figure and probably the
<br>
most attractive ideologically for many in the media, plus his &quot;spoiler&quot;
<br>
role in some states has helped him get coverage.  Given that Browne and
<br>
Buchanan are not that far below Nader (1% to his 5% or so), the light
<br>
cast on Nader gets reflected on the others somewhat.
<br>
