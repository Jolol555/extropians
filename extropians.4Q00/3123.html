<p><em> &gt; The predicted instability of the solid version of the dyson sphere has been
</em><br>
<em> &gt; a source of disappointment for moi ever since I heard about it.  The idea
</em><br>
<p>While the idea of man-made celestial crystal sphere is rather neat, I
<br>
do not see any essential features not covered by a cloud of orbiting
<br>
objects, which can be made even optically dense. It would be
<br>
interesting to see how we can use this to intercept the majority of
<br>
the solar wind, too. Implanting them into periodically recycled
<br>
sacrificial layers; using magnetic field traps?
<br>
<p>So, whence the disappointment?
<br>
<p><em> &gt; of the fully enclosed star was so delightful to me, and so elegant, that I
</em><br>
<em> &gt; pondered long over the matter seeking some remedy, some bit of phenomenon
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to rescue me from my despair.  I considered the predicted instability, and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; concluded that it was factually supported, but based on +considerations of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; gravity and gravity alone.  Gravity, to the exclusion of all other forces
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in the universe, as if no other forces existed.  Fortuitously, this is not
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the case.  Also fortuitously, the gravitational 'instability' is neutral.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; That is, gravity does not actively drive the system to collapse, but rather
</em><br>
<em> &gt; stands by, having no effect at all.  This is in contrast to orbital
</em><br>
<p>Hmm. Even if you could construct it, what about self gravitation
<br>
(collapse is autocatalytic), and tidal forces? Also, the thing as a
<br>
whole is in orbit (since static sphere can only be too gossamer to be
<br>
of much use), so the equator will be doing allright, but you're in
<br>
deep shit as soon as you start deviating from the equatorial
<br>
orbits. Orbital cloud solves this by changing height and inclination
<br>
of the orbit, so stuff never collides (this won't work if the orbiting
<br>
stuff is dumb and has no control over own orbit).  With the cloud, you
<br>
have only the fragmentation catastrophe, and you can lick that with
<br>
active orbit control.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Radiation pressure, baby.  It ain't big, but it's real.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
If your orbit has no radial component (wheee!), you can't held
<br>
anything relevant afloat, even if the floating stuff is heated to
<br>
white incandescence. Do the math. Magnetic plasma sails do much
<br>
better, but you can't operate another one within few 10 km radius.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; Solar radiation on the interior of the sphere will tend to drive the sphere
</em><br>
<em> &gt; so that the center of the sphere describes an 'orbit' around the star.  To
</em><br>
<em> &gt; see why this is so, consider what happens if the star is off-center.  The
</em><br>
<em> &gt; portion of the sphere nearest the star has the greater density of incident
</em><br>
<em> &gt; photons to both absorb and reflect.  It will reach a higher temperature and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; thus a higher albedo, so it will reflect (rather than absorb) a higher
</em><br>
<em> &gt; percentage of the incident photons than the more distant (and thus cooler)
</em><br>
<em> &gt; interior surface.  These two factors, photon density and correlated albedo
</em><br>
<em> &gt; values, should be the determining factors in the net thrust derived from
</em><br>
<em> &gt; radiation pressure.  Higher albedo means higher reflection, and a reflected
</em><br>
<em> &gt; photon delivers twice the thrust of an absorbed photon.  This thrust should
</em><br>
<em> &gt; act as a restoring force driving the sphere back towards the concentric
</em><br>
<em> &gt; position.  There being no particular reason for it to stop once it reaches
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the concentric position, it would tend to overshoot, decelerate and then
</em><br>
<em> &gt; reverse direction, oscillating in a back and forth manner.  This
</em><br>
<em> &gt; oscillation, in two dimensions, and out of phase, would stabilize to a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; condition where the sphere center describes an 'orbit' around the star. 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Have you considered that you're heating the star up, by reflecting the
<br>
bulk of radiation back in in form of shortwave photons? (Instead of
<br>
making the orbiting objects as black as possible). Whatever the star
<br>
is going to do, this is not going to be sustainable. You're going to
<br>
heat the star, which will bloat and emit bluer and bluer. You'll
<br>
likely can boost mass loss that way, by making the surface hotter.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; The exterior of the sphere will likewise have an asymmetric radiation
</em><br>
<em> &gt; emission pattern resulting in a net thrust.  A worst case scenario is that
</em><br>
<p>Why assymetric? A fraction of the photons get absorbed, and is heating
<br>
the envelope. The asymmetric thing is more interesting if you can make
<br>
the cloud radiate anisotropically, predominantly in one
<br>
direction. However, this impacts recoil upon the cloud, shifting it's
<br>
orbit. Will you cancel out the impulse impacted upon the residual
<br>
system (minus the radiated photons), if you use photonic pressure to
<br>
readjust the disturbed cloud component orbits? I have no idea. Someone
<br>
please tell me, as it is rather significant.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; the (waste) heat is transmitted through the shell locally and re-emitted
</em><br>
<em> &gt; locally.  Clearly, it would be re-emitted--dumped--at a lower wavelength
</em><br>
<em> &gt; resulting in a lower net thrust (I think I got that right) than that caused
</em><br>
<em> &gt; by the radiation forces on the interior. The interior and exterior
</em><br>
<em> &gt; radiation reaction forces appear to work in opposite directions, but since
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the radiation incident on the interior surface is a restoring force and the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; greater of the two, the net effect is a restoring force.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; One piece of this puzzle that goes beyond what I can handle is what is the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; effect of the radiation in the interior of the sphere after it first
</em><br>
<em> &gt; strikes the shell?  If it's absorbed I have no problem, but if it's
</em><br>
<em> &gt; reflected and then absorbed, or bounces around for several generations
</em><br>
<em> &gt; before finally being absorbed, what is the net effect?  I think first order
</em><br>
<em> &gt; effects will dominate as described, but I'm prepared to hear other points
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of view.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Someone may say that radiation forces are puny in the inertial arena.  I
</em><br>
<em> &gt; agree, but if they're the only forces in play, then they must dominate.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Response times are just very long.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Candidate number two is something of a mystery to me.  I know it's there,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; but I frankly don't know  how it acts on the system or how it compares in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; magnitude of effect to radiation pressure.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Magnetic field effects.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The star may have a magnetic field.  The field lines may extend out into
</em><br>
<em> &gt; space. How far out do they extend?  They may interact with the dyson
</em><br>
<em> &gt; sphere.  They may be conducted through the dyson sphere.  What is the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; sphere made of?  If it were made metallic and isotropic, would the star and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; sphere be magnetically drawn together, or held stably concentric?  Could a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; non-isotropic or non-metallic sphere design take advantage of or circumvent
</em><br>
<em> &gt; magnetic effects to passively achieve spherical concentricity? 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Help me.  I've fallen and I can't get up.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; One last note.  Though the 800 lb gorilla appears neutral in this matter,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that's only first order effects.  Second order gravitational effects may
</em><br>
<em> &gt; come into play.  If the non-uniform heating of one side of the sphere
</em><br>
<em> &gt; causes it to distort, or tidal forces cause it to distort, then
</em><br>
<em> &gt; gravitational forces may again come into play.  The devil's in the details.
</em><br>
<p>The devil is that you can't build a sphere of any relevant size
<br>
without infinitely strong material (Unobtainium still isn't in the PSE
<br>
last time I looked). Denser objects are sufficiently small, but
<br>
they're typically fierce and have literally astronomic gravitation
<br>
gradients. You might construct you classical Dyson sphere around a
<br>
very small singularity (a primeordial relict or a newly minted),
<br>
though. If it has something like a few g/s mass loss as Hawking
<br>
radiation, and has the right wavelength (I'm rather not warm my toes
<br>
directly on a hard xRay source), you could build your sphere around
<br>
it. Even fill the sphere envelope with some gas/dust, so that you can
<br>
homeostate the hole in the right regime by feeding just as much as it
<br>
evaporates, and attenuate the hard radiation from the eye of the
<br>
dragon (hole and accretion disk). The whole thing doesn't have to have
<br>
more than a few Gt mass, probably, and would be rather cold on the
<br>
surface. Invisible unless there are lots of them, or you look at one
<br>
from real close. And rather efficient, of course.
