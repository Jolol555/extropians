I posted a largish reply to this issue, but it looks like it got bounced.
<br>
(Is there a size limit?) Let me summarize:
<br>
<p>I'm arguing against the idea that a second data point (defined as a
<br>
non-local environment that gives rise to intelligent life) allows you to
<br>
escape from the observer selection effect of the AP.
<br>
<p><p>From: &quot;Damien Broderick&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:d.broderick@english.unimelb.edu.au?Subject=Re:%20Fermi%20Paradox%20in%20the%20news&In-Reply-To=&lt;001101c03f2f$47452320$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">d.broderick@english.unimelb.edu.au</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt; Er, Jason - I think you're just not getting it. Slow down for a moment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gene is construing the AP as an epistemological screening filter. We see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we see because we are here, not vice versa.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, you're right, I am going too fast.  I am actually aware of how Gene
<br>
is using AP, but I haven't been very clear in the direction in which I'm
<br>
attempting to invalidate it.  Let me address a few of your comments, and
<br>
then try to be more careful in my contructions here.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;If dolphins were intelligent, would this be a two blip, or a one blip?
</em><br>
Why?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That *could* be a good question, but I doubt it - it's still local-bound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions. If smart archaeo-gloop near a volcanic vent aced the IQ
</em><br>
scores,
<br>
<em>&gt; maybe.
</em><br>
<p>Consider: what is &quot;local-bound?&quot;  You are grouping dolphin intelligence to
<br>
human intelligence because we shared local conditions for emergence-- my
<br>
argument is that other denizens of this *universe* share &quot;local&quot; (rules of
<br>
this reality,) conditions for emergence (macro-scale physical laws.)  We've
<br>
arbitrarily decided on a planetary arena as the immediate birthing criterion
<br>
for intelligence, when instead I'd argue that we inhabit a physical reality
<br>
that should be considered the ultimate arena.
<br>
<p><p>Let me quote what I consider to be the key phrase from Nick's posting and
<br>
see if I can clearly indicate what I consider to be the problematic aspects:
<br>
<p>Nick Bostrom wrote:
<br>
<p>&quot;No matter how small a fraction of all planets in our infinite universe
<br>
develop life, we would by necessity find that we originate from one of the
<br>
exceptional ones that did.&quot;
<br>
<p>There are two arbitrary classifications going on here.  The first:  Planets
<br>
develop life.  The second:  &quot;We&quot; = humanity.  I sort of rattled off a couple
<br>
of quick arguments against this, but let me go a bit further, and hope it
<br>
doesn't continue to appear that I am trumpeting my own ignorance:
<br>
<p>Let us take a step back.  Let's pretend that planets don't develop life:
<br>
realities develop life.  (Or rather, realities develop universes, universes
<br>
develop planets and planets develop life.)  Let's further pretend that &quot;we&quot;
<br>
doesn't equal humanity, but rather &quot;we&quot; equals &quot;all observers.&quot;  This is
<br>
what the AP really says after all, doesn't it:  i.e.: Observers should not
<br>
be surprised to be observing a reality that begets observers.  Right?
<br>
<p>In this capacity, the AP has no discretion-- it does not distinguish between
<br>
planets, and it does not distinguish between sentiences.  It tells us simply
<br>
that we are in a reality that begets observers.  This is a tautology and
<br>
doesn't provide any epistemological filters to other observers, because it
<br>
has no discretionary capacity over micro-scale processes: i.e.: it does not
<br>
distinguish between planets as birthing places, but speaks rather to the
<br>
overall nature of the reality we inhabit.  It also doesn't distinguish
<br>
between observers: you are not distinguished from me, and Vegans are not
<br>
distinguished from us.
