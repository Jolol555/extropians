It's a fair question. Maybe it's too early to learn real information about
<br>
how the world works? Maybe we should let them live in a fantasy world until
<br>
some later age, when we determine that they are ready for the real thing?
<br>
<p>I don't believe that, quite obviously. Also, I'd dispute the dichotomy. You
<br>
can very easily do both things at once. For instance, Morgana is totally
<br>
into fairies at the moment (pokemon has just become yesterday's hero,
<br>
unfortunately), and spends most of her time entirely wrapped in a fantasy
<br>
world of teddy bears, bunnies, and mouse fairies. With a name like that,
<br>
well, what would you expect?
<br>
<p>However, she's also interested in the real thing. I don't think this is
<br>
anything specific to her; I've talked to lots of kids here and there about
<br>
science/techie stuff; they really like it. You have to think about what kids
<br>
are trying to do, at that stage in life. Kids are trying to grasp how the
<br>
world works, to be able to model physical (and social) reality in their
<br>
heads, so that they can better predict outcomes, and ultimately so that they
<br>
can exert some real influence on the world.
<br>
<p>I object to the fairytails-only mental diet fed to many kids. It seems to be
<br>
mostly about delivering a package of standard memes, to infect the kids in
<br>
just the way the adults desire. Some of those memes are really dodgy too;
<br>
the groundwork for religion, obeying authority, social hierarchies,
<br>
deathism, (too many to enumerate). It's catching them at their most
<br>
vulnerable, and exposing them to questionable ideas with absolutely no way
<br>
of defending themselves; they have no real information, or the mental
<br>
frameworks, with which to question this stuff. So it takes hold, digs in
<br>
deep, and shapes the rest of their lives.
<br>
<p>Why not give them a bit of real information, along with the fluff? Why not
<br>
help kids learn how to think, as well as (instead of) how to swallow
<br>
whatever tripe they are fed? It's a bit scary, I'll admit... for instance,
<br>
for a (relatively short) while my daughter went through a religious phase
<br>
(in a naive kind of way), and it was pretty challenging for me not to oppose
<br>
it (I'm sure I did anyway, in one way or another).
<br>
<p>I can't help feeding my kids my own beliefs, just like every other parent.
<br>
I'm trying to counter that by giving them as much independant access to real
<br>
information as I can. That means encouraging them to learn to read as early
<br>
as possible, encouraging them to ask questions and find things out. It also
<br>
means relatively unfettered internet access as soon as it is useful (ie:
<br>
when reading is at a high enough standard) - that's a bit scary, but I
<br>
couldn't justify not doing it.
<br>
<p>There's probably more to say, but I've run out of steam... I'm sure more
<br>
will follow.
