Many on the list will be already familiar with the famous bet between Julian 
<br>
Simon and Paul Ehrlich, but it seems worth mentioning in this thread(when I 
<br>
first heard about it, years ago, it was a revelatory experience - and the 
<br>
beginning of the end of my believing the green's lies...)
<br>
Out of laziness, rather than explaining the whole thing myself, I am posting 
<br>
an extract of an article found on a site I don't know much about, but which 
<br>
seems interesting.

Julian Simon's Bet With Paul Ehrlich
<br>
By Brian Carnell
<br>
Thursday, May 18, 2000
<br>
In 1980, economist Julian Simon and biologist Paul Ehrlich decided to put 
<br>
their money where their predictions were. Ehrlich had been predicting 
<br>
massive shortages in various natural resources for decades, while Simon 
<br>
claimed natural resources were infinite.
<br>
Simon offered Ehrlich a bet centered on the market price of metals. Ehrlich 
<br>
would pick a quantity of any five metals he liked worth $1,000 in 1980. If 
<br>
the 1990 value of the metals, after adjusting for inflation, was more than 
<br>
$1,000 (i.e. the metals became more scarce), Ehrlich would win. If, however, 
<br>
the value of the metals after inflation was less than $1,000 (i.e. the 
<br>
metals became less scare), Simon would win. The loser would mail the winner 
<br>
a check for the change in price.
<br>
Ehrlich agreed to the bet and chose copper, chrome, nickel, tin and 
<br>
tungsten.
<br>
By 1990, all five metal were below their real price level in 1970. Ehrlich 
<br>
lost the bet and sent Simon a check for $576.07. Prices of the metals chosen 
<br>
fell so much that Simon would have won the bet even if the prices hadn't 
<br>
been adjusted for inflation (Bast 1994, p.124). Here's how each of the 
<br>
metals performed from 1980-1990.
<br>
<p>Metal 	          1980 price (1980 $) 	1990 price (1980 $) 	%change
<br>
<p>Copper (195.56 lbs.) 	$200 	           $163 	        -18.5%
<br>
Chrome (51.28 lbs.) 	$200 	           $120 	        -40%
<br>
Nickel (63.52 lbs.) 	$200 	           $193 	        -3.5%
<br>
Tin (229.1 lbs.) 	$200 	           $56 	                -72%
<br>
Tungsten (13.64 lbs.) 	$200 	           $86 	                -57%
<br>
(Tierney 1990, p.81)
