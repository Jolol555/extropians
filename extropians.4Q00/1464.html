</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; socialism.&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>How does transferring control of all companies to the government help
<br>
anyone? Everywhere it has been tried it has led to gross inefficiencies
<br>
and seriously outmoded industrial base.  How does having a government
<br>
committee run anything make it run better?  Especially how does any
<br>
central committee managed to get and act intelligently on distributed
<br>
information and manage its many unforeseen consequences?  The more
<br>
complex the world becomes the less likely such an approach is to work.  
<br>
<p>If you want to enrich the worker and distribute wealth more equitably
<br>
then leave the stock with the workers rather than in the hands of the
<br>
bureaucrats. I think that as automation replaces more and more workers
<br>
we ultimately may need to give stock in the corporations and ownership
<br>
of the machines to all citizens in order to have a decent standard of
<br>
living on our way to Singularity.

<p><p>&lt;huge grin&gt; Alright!  But I don't really grok how democratic socialist
<br>
can be mixed with libertarian.  The rest of it makes some sense.
