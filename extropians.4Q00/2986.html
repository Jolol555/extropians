<em>&gt;Sigh. Broken record. Okay, let's try this one more time.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I haven't been here very long and was just chiming in.  I'm 
<br>
willing to play, though. :)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If... an... industry... cannot... stay... afloat... without... the...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government... propping... them... up... does... it... deserve... to...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continue... existing?
</em><br>
<p>No, unless the industry is of vital importance to protecting the 
<br>
lives (and property rights) of the citizens of the country, like the 
<br>
military.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If... a... &quot;right&quot;... is... unenforceable... is... it... a... natural...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right?
</em><br>
<p>Unenforceable?  Copyrights aren't unenforceable.  They're difficult 
<br>
to enforce, but they aren't &quot;unenforceable&quot;.  Have we switched 
<br>
subjects here?
<br>
<p>Another approach:
<br>
<p>You have a societally agreed upon right to live: agreed?
<br>
<p>We may discover a deadly poison that takes effect one month after 
<br>
skin contact.  Since this is an extropians list: imagine a nanobot 
<br>
that would burrow into your skin and then lie dormant for one month. 
<br>
After that month, it would release some deadly toxin into your blood 
<br>
stream.
<br>
<p>Imagine further that we reach a point where creating nanobots is 
<br>
something that anyone can do with a reasonably-priced kit.
<br>
<p>Just think of how easy it would be to kill someone without anyone 
<br>
knowing who did it.  Your right to live would then become an 
<br>
&quot;unenforceable&quot; right.  Does that mean that you should no longer have 
<br>
it?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
