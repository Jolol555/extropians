Hi Robert.
<br>
<p>I'd love to engage your post at length, but, well, we've been going around
<br>
in circles here for quite some time, so I'm just going to make a brief
<br>
comment regarding a portion of your post:
<br>
<p>Do we -really- &quot;remember&quot; who we are each morning?  I doubt we functionally
<br>
'reboot' every morning as our OS consults the memory banks to reload our
<br>
identity.  I think the computer analogy is being spread rather thin in this
<br>
debate.  I'm probably an advocate of Minsky's model-- we are an amalgamation
<br>
of processes-- some of which become quiescent during sleep, others of which
<br>
remain active.  Further, we -are- also currently our hardware: not only the
<br>
electrochemical processes that take place there.  My personal belief
<br>
regarding the consistency of our intellect is that the process is very
<br>
robust, it is distributed, it maintains continuity across down-time, some of
<br>
it is solid-state, and it is a dynamic process that moves through time, and
<br>
requires a state of emergence in which to operate.
<br>
<p>Personally, I think we're going to find that as we make computers that
<br>
become capable of being conscious, they'll have to start to behave in robust
<br>
new ways that will represent a total paradigm shift in how we think about
<br>
computing.  They will probably need to stay on, for instance, all the time.
<br>
<p>Despite the fact that this debate has swerved in this direction, I'm
<br>
actually talking about a concept somewhat wider than the term
<br>
&quot;consciousness,&quot; which is why I used the phrase &quot;reality experiencer.&quot;  I do
<br>
not think that it is necessary to be having thoughts all the time to be
<br>
considered alive, rather it is sufficient to merely &quot;be.&quot;  Sleep is a state
<br>
of &quot;be&quot;ing.  The pilot light is on.  I disagree that we need to be aware of
<br>
our on&quot;ness&quot; to be, truly, &quot;on.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Since I'm partial to the perspective that sleep is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very altered state of consciousness, it seems that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waking up is really a warm reboot.  If so, I'd suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that every day we are living as copies of ourselves.
</em><br>
<p>If this were true (and this would be the last day for this particular
<br>
iteration of &quot;me.&quot;) it means only that I'd need to find a way to be always
<br>
&quot;on.&quot;  That would suck, because I don't have a lot of time...
<br>
<p>Of course, it would be hard for me to rationally refuse a teleportation
<br>
event, for instance, given that the results would be identical to &quot;just
<br>
going to sleep.&quot;
<br>
<p>Fortunately, however, I don't happen to think it quite works that way.
