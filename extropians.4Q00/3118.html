Hi Extropians,
<br>
<p>I'm still interested in the exact reasons why lapachone &amp; taxol combos would
<br>
wake up defective checkpoints....
<br>
<p>(Such a regime might have cancer prophylaxis worth for life
<br>
extensionists...)
<br>
<p>This paper (abstract below) seems to offer an explanation of sorts.

<p>Potent inhibition of tumor survival in vivo by beta-lapachone plus taxol:
<br>
combining drugs imposes different artificial checkpoints.

<br>
<p>Ablation of tumor colonies was seen in a wide spectrum of human carcinoma
<br>
cells in culture after treatment with the combination of beta-lapachone and
<br>
taxol, two low molecular mass compounds. They synergistically induced death
<br>
of cultured ovarian, breast, prostate, melanoma, lung, colon, and pancreatic
<br>
cancer cells. This synergism is schedule dependent; namely, taxol must be
<br>
added either simultaneously or after beta-lapachone. This combination
<br>
therapy has unusually potent antitumor activity against human ovarian and
<br>
prostate tumor prexenografted in mice. There is little host toxicity. Cells
<br>
can commit to apoptosis at cell-cycle checkpoints, a mechanism that
<br>
eliminates defective cells to ensure the integrity of the genome. We
<br>
hypothesize that when cells are treated simultaneously with drugs activating
<br>
more than one different cell-cycle checkpoint, the production of conflicting
<br>
regulatory signaling molecules induces apoptosis in cancer cells.
<br>
beta-Lapachone causes cell-cycle delays in late G(1) and S phase, and taxol
<br>
arrests cells at G(2)/M. Cells treated with both drugs were delayed at
<br>
multiple checkpoints before committing to apoptosis. Our findings suggest an
<br>
avenue for developing anticancer therapy by exploiting apoptosis-prone
<br>
&quot;collisions&quot; at cell-cycle checkpoints.
