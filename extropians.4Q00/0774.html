<p><em> &gt; Cool, I was wondering who would say this. I disagree. As long as there

</em><br>
<p>That's a theoretical position. In practice, if confronted with
<br>
neverending agony (apparently, nothing you've ever experienced), you
<br>
will recant in minutes, screaming your voice off.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; my fantasies. I might even still be able to interact with my
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Nope. You're strapped down, sensorily deprived with one acute
<br>
sensation: PAIN. And then some. Plus a bit more. Multiply that by ten.
<br>
Industrial-strength torture, guaranteed to endure for the next
<br>
millenia, unabated.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I'm alive, there is always a wildcard; the possibility that I'll figure
</em><br>
<em> &gt; out some way to improve the situation. So, when I was a kid, shortly
</em><br>
<p>Not only is there PAIN, there is also the absence of HOPE. Otherwise,
<br>
it would hardly qualify as eternal torment, wouldn't it?
<br>
<p>To amplify, we're talking about a pure destillation only achievable in
<br>
artificial reality (to keep the edge pure, and you from unravelling on
<br>
the long run). Nothing the best human torturemeisters could ever
<br>
achieve. Electroshocks burn out the nerves, and even the hardest
<br>
characters tend to go crack up before long, escaping into insanity. No 
<br>
such solace here.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; after I stopped fearing hell (for reasons of its nonexistance, of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; course) I started wishing there would be some kind of afterlife, hell
</em><br>
<em> &gt; or not. Anything to me would be better than just an abrupt end. 
</em><br>
<p>If confronted with a choice: eternal agony or a painless death, I'll
<br>
drink the waters of Lethe, anytime.
