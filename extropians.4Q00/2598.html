<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; In thinking about psychology, has anyone here read the work of Ken
</em><br>
Wilber?
<br>
<em>&gt;  I have derived much understanding form his integral approach to
</em><br>
psychology.
<br>
<em>&gt;  I would be very interested in hearing some Extropian views about his
</em><br>
work.
<br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With Ken Wilber, I experienced a Asimovian MEGO (My Eyes Glaze Over). I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe Ken Wilber, who on the covers on his books, looks like the musical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performance artist MOBY, is basically into reincarnation aka
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transpersonalism. I think that is what the integral verbage is--could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong, tho'. Didn't inspire this boy, but he may not be for everyone's
</em><br>
taste.
<br>
<p>Transpersonalism has little to say on what happens after death- at least in
<br>
the voluminous material that I've read on the field (which I plan to go
<br>
into, BTW).  It's more or less about realizing that we aren't our bodies,
<br>
and that this revelation doesn't require the existence of any kind of
<br>
spiritual matter- just a recognition that our body is little more than a
<br>
nexus for all the outside influences controlling it (which are all part of
<br>
the actual I), and that your &quot;I&quot; is not the machine that percieves, but the
<br>
totality of the percieved existence.  It's basically a return to idealistic
<br>
monism through the dissolution of the ego-complex, at it's heart.
<br>
<p>When you die, the machine is gone, and no ephemeral &quot;soul&quot; survives- yet
<br>
existence, the true I, continues.  The metaphysical implications of this are
<br>
pretty deep, and extremely hard to understand from a human perspective.
<br>
