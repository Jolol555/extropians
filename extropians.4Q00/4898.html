</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seemed to have worked ok....i consider him to be a success...
</em><br>
<p>I doubt I'm typical enough to be worth generalizing from, but for what
<br>
it's worth:
<br>
<p>1)  I was perfectly capable of understanding bacteria at age 5.  I don't
<br>
remember learning about bacteria in particular, but I do know that I
<br>
understood the layers of the Earth's core, the layout of the solar system,
<br>
the leaves of the ginko, how a lever works, and all the other things they
<br>
explain in Childcraft books.
<br>
<p>2)  My father always told me that he drove with his eyes closed and
<br>
navigated by sonar, so that if I made too much noise the car would crash. 
<br>
He explained that the screws that held my head on were located in my nose,
<br>
so that if I picked my nose, my head would fall off.  He claimed that the
<br>
beef jerky he was creating was 'bat meat'.  (Of these three claims, I only
<br>
believed the third, which I think is pretty good going.)
<br>
<p>The apparent moral:  It's okay to tell the kid ridiculous lies as long as
<br>
you go on megadosing them with the truth as well.
<br>
<p>The real moral:  Kids *will* remember the lies you tell them four years
<br>
later.
