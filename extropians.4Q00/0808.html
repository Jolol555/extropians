</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; square meters. A 10% efficient system that covers the entire roof, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no skylights, will generate 6 kilowatts ONLY at the peak period at noon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Power generation will begin at a very low level around 7 am and end at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about 7 pm, and increase along a bell curve up and down through the day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Such a system will generate around 20-24 kilowatt hours per day,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assuming no cloudy weather. This is less than 10% of the power needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the average home.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think your roof size may be too low (depends a lot on how many stories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the home is) and your energy peak may be too high (Robert Freitas keeps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beating me up anytime I use a number over 400 W/m^2).  But I don't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why you say 10% since my electric bill says I'm averaging 40 kWh/day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and thats with a lot of computers on all the time).
</em><br>
<p>Where are you located? Do you use any gas/oil heating/cooking appliances? How
<br>
many kids do you support and in what age groups? Kids are very wasteful of
<br>
energy, my parents use less than 1/4 of the electricity they used when all four
<br>
kids lived in the house, also, you will see some losses from converting energy
<br>
to battery storage and back. I based the peak on optimistic sunny climate low
<br>
latitudes. The average would obviously be lower due to weather, seasons, etc.
<br>
<p>The roof size I based on a two story raised ranch of 12 x 8 meters, roof slope
<br>
of about 30 degrees, with an internal square footage of around 2200 square feet.
<br>
This is actually on the large size for my community, with four bedrooms, two
<br>
baths, living room, family room, dining room, kitchen, roofed balcony along one
<br>
side of the house and two car garage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your point is taken though.  The efficiency needs to go up.  You can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always double the roof area by doing a little reconstruction.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if the material is really cheap (like tar paper), you would put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it on the exterior wall surfaces as well.  You probably couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disconnect yourself from the grid, but you could make a good dent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in your electric bill.  The real trick will be lowering the electrical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requirements of the refridgerator, since that is generally the biggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; draw in the house.  We need some more progress with magnetic cooling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using gandolinium or acoustic cooling.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think constructing the home to take better advantage of passive
<br>
solar thermal, as well as providing cooling from ground sink, needs to be
<br>
emphasized in home construction much more.
