<p>A person of the type described is suffering from a possibly curable

mental 
<br>
condition, almost certainly curable a bit down the line.
<br>
<p>&quot;Proper punishment&quot; presumes that punishment actually accomplishes
<br>
something
<br>
worthwhile.  Yet it has been demonstrated that execution is not a real
<br>
deterrent and a punishment that kills the offender certainly cannot be
<br>
said
<br>
to rehabilitate them.  
<br>
<p>In the case of a non-psychotic person a &quot;proper punishment&quot; or rather
<br>
&quot;making what restitution is possible&quot; might involve picking up most/all
<br>
of the slain person's debts and obligations or being indentured to the
<br>
family for a period of time.  Or not.  The question I was attempting to
<br>
address was as in the topic line.  Not what the proper response to
<br>
murder outside of execution vs. suspension is.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;How can a sentient, caring person condemn another human being to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When that human being has committed an irreversible crime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>All irreverisble crimes?  Like damaging property irreverisbly for
<br>
instance?  Again, how does creating another irreversible loss in any way
<br>
balance out the original one?
