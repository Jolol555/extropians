Dan Fabulich writes, quoting Robin Hanson:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think that there are large differences in value at play here, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think the prospects of a moral revolution in the libertarian direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anytime soon to be small, and similar in magnitude to prospects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moral revolutions in opposite directions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd actually say that our odds are quite worse than the odds in favor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a moral revolution in the opposite direction.  Socialism, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, is popular because it is in no way a subtle deduction from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic principle.  It's simply a call for &quot;equality,&quot; and a revolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to bring about a government to enforce equality by any means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary.
</em><br>
<p>I am more optimistic that conditions will be ripe for an increase in
<br>
popularity of libertarian ideals.  This is due to technological changes
<br>
as network communications continue to become more widespread.
<br>
<p>The basic libertarian principle, as I see it, is tolerance of others,
<br>
respecting their right to be left alone as long as they show similar
<br>
respect.  This principle is perfectly suited to virtual interactions on
<br>
the net.
<br>
<p>First, the net brings us into contact with a much wider community of
<br>
people from all over the earth.  While it is true that we can filter
<br>
the net and focus our attention on selected groups, we can't help but
<br>
become aware of the wide range of variation which exists.  Exposure to
<br>
diversity will, I hope, eventually lead to increased tolerance.
<br>
<p>Second, because interactions on the net are virtual, they are inherently
<br>
consensual.  You can't punch someone's nose over the net.  Of course there
<br>
are exceptions to this, spam and DOS attacks and such, but by and large,
<br>
communications over the net provide no role for coercion.
<br>
<p>I believe that as people experience more of their interactions via the
<br>
net and its future extensions, they will naturally come to experience
<br>
and appreciate libertarian principles of tolerance and non-coercion.
<br>
With these ideas planted in their minds, the next step will be to try
<br>
to apply these same principles in the real world as well.
<br>
<p>If we can all get along peacefully in cyberspace, each person doing what
<br>
he will without harming others, is it so unreasonable to think that the
<br>
same thing can be achieved in physical space as well?  Of course there are
<br>
many practical difficulties, recognized by libertarians of all stripes,
<br>
but achieving the first step of a common philosophical perspective will
<br>
be an enormous advance in the desired direction.  Once people come to
<br>
agree on the goal, we obviously have a much better chance of achieving it.
<br>
<p>That's my hope, anyway.  It's a long term dream, decades away, but I
<br>
believe we will see increased acceptance of libertarian principles as
<br>
the years go by.
<br>
