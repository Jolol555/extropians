<p><em> &gt; But suppose the machine evolves ten billion times faster - suppose the

</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Huh? Both systems still evolve. (Of course, you have to have a
<br>
population, not a single individuum for it to happen). They still
<br>
couple, by virtue of occupying the same timespace. Of course, because
<br>
their fitness is not equal, one of the players is going to bite the
<br>
dust.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; In fact there may be tons of such entities all around us... in fact we may
</em><br>
<em> &gt; find little evidence of &quot;intelligence&quot; in the universe because WE ARE NOT
</em><br>
<em> &gt; INTELLIGENT!
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Of course we're dumb as interstellar dirt, but life doesn't have to be
<br>
particularly intelligent to be visible. One of the less likely
<br>
solutions to the Fermi's paradoxon is that new physics is just round
<br>
the corner, and transcension, being a high-energy event, automatically
<br>
sterilizes the expanding wavefront of own pre-transcension tech.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I don't subscribe to that scenario. Not every culture must
<br>
automatically transcend. The one which doesn't will get amplified all
<br>
over the place and will become visible. Entities which are not
<br>
observable must necessarily fall prey to Occam's razor. We don't have
<br>
yet any evidence of a new exploitable physics either. Conditions
<br>
necessary for emergence of intelligent life seem to be very rare --
<br>
due to a cosmic fluke, we seem to have led a highly sheltered life.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Lastly - in organic evolution, species only coevolve if they interact with
</em><br>
<em> &gt; respect to common environmental resources. If Eliezer's machines evolve very
</em><br>
<em> &gt; rapidly then it might be likely that in a short time - (...say...)
</em><br>
<em> &gt; milliseconds to half a decade - they would not compete substantially for
</em><br>
<em> &gt; resources with the human species.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; This will be an adaptive radiation scenario...it is within the realms of
</em><br>
<p>Let's assume we have real world niches and unreal world niches. If the
<br>
seed perceives the unreal niches and migrates over there before it
<br>
radiates, it effectively vanishes from our universe. If the seed
<br>
radiates before that, it will occupy both real world niches and unreal
<br>
world niches. The deity may have moved on to the Great Beyond, but
<br>
it's retinue left behind is still ruining the real estate prices in
<br>
the neighbourhood.
<br>
<p>Provided, there's still new physics at all, my bets fall on the second 
<br>
scenario.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; probability.. because the machines might discover a new physical environment
</em><br>
<em> &gt; into which they could radiate. At the very best we won't notice anything.
</em><br>
<p>Radiating species attempt to fill all available niches. Even if one
<br>
class of niches is way cushier, they're expanding as a random cloud in
<br>
the genotype/phenotype space, and hence will eventually fill them all.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Any way you cut it... the future is not good for the all-consuming human
</em><br>
<em> &gt; ego... but this is predictable... primates tend to have big egos - and they
</em><br>
<em> &gt; also tend to be contriol freaks. You walk around with a handful of big
</em><br>
<em> &gt; balloons and someone will come along to burst 'em.
</em><br>
<p>Amen. So let's make lots less ook ook ook and do some thinkin'
<br>
instead, for a change.
