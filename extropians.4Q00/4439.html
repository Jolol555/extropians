<p>Exactly. One of the interesting ideas ST had about the Borg was that
<br>
it was a highly adaptable &quot;species&quot;. In guess the Borg would be
<br>
extremely flexible if what any unit learned would be transferred to
<br>
the whole collective - which was of course why ST then ignored the
<br>
whole thing except for some silly talk about phaser frequencies. A
<br>
Borg that changed strategy, used clever ambushes, exploited the
<br>
know-how about the enemy newly assimilated units had and moved fast
<br>
would not make a good enemy, since Enterprise wouldn't have a chance
<br>
:-) Sasha described something like this collective learning in his
<br>
Networking in the Mind Age paper.
<br>
<p>You don't need a group mind to create a learning organisation
<br>
though. As Greg pointed out, the legal system acts as a very slow
<br>
one. (Hmm, maybe that would be a suitable opponent in Star Trek:
<br>
&quot;Captain, our scanners detect a Litigator Cube ahead! It has caught us
<br>
in a subpoena beam!&quot;).
