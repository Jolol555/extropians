</em><br>
<p>That doesn't seem likely to me, because the divorce rate seems to parallel
<br>
the rate of technological advance.

<p>I'll drink to that! Sounds like a cyborg orgy (&quot;borgy&quot;?). Instead of
<br>
proposing marriage, partners could invite each other to borgy together, to
<br>
commune beyond biology.

<p>I think Max More covered this in his earlier post. To wit:

<em>&gt; I don't think any of us have a clear idea as to what will become of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong emotions like love if/when we become posthuman.  That question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a lot in common with the perennial &quot;What would it feel like to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a posthuman?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Even more esoteric is the question: What would it feel like to be a
<br>
*married* posthuman.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe we'd feel something that felt just like love for the rest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of our Borg.  But darned if I know.
</em><br>
<p>Blessed if you know. Personally, I speculate that I'd rather borganize
<br>
than marry. (But hey! nobody has asked me -- yet.)

<em>&gt; Oh? What about Morganatic marriages and corporate mergers?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about Morganatic marriages... whazzat? As for corporations,
<br>
remember that they can't own real estate (according to California RE law)
<br>
as joint tenants, because corporations never die (so they can't assign
<br>
property to surviving spouses). Perhaps borgs will come under the same
<br>
laws as corporations. Maybe Greg Burch has considered this. In any event,
<br>
corporate law now differs dramatically from divorce/marriage law. I
<br>
suppose marriage will go the way of chivalry and knights in shining
<br>
armor -- or perhaps it will go the way of phlogiston and vitalism. &lt;g&gt;
