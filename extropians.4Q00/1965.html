<em>&gt; 1.  Is their natural spectrum lighting in the place Eli works? 
</em><br>
<p>Only if you count sunlight, during the day.  I had natural spectrum lighting
<br>
in Chicago, and there wasn't a perceptible difference as a result.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2.  Does Eli sleep on a really comfortable mattress?
</em><br>
<p>No, but it's on the shopping list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3.  Is he exercising enough each day?
</em><br>
<p>90 minutes or so.  I don't know if I'll still have the time for that once I
<br>
switch to coding, but designing takes such a peak mental output that there are
<br>
plenty of minutes left over for the physical stuff.  (I've lost some weight,
<br>
but I've still got a long way to go.  I'm trying to get into some kind of
<br>
physical condition that can be maintained with minimum effort once I start
<br>
running out of minutes.)
<br>
<p>Incidentally, I can now say from personal experience that the idea that
<br>
exercise makes your mind sharper is, as far as I can tell, completely untrue. 
<br>
It makes your body lighter.  That's it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4.  Having a pet could be good for Eli's frame of mind.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Do you like daisies?  I plant them, but they always die.  Everything that I
<br>
put in the ground withers and dies...&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5.  And what about Eli's reading habits?  We all laud him for the scholarly tomes he reads but man cannot live on serious scholarship alone.
</em><br>
<p>Second-generation SF fan, remember?  My Dad got interested in my Mom because
<br>
of her science-fiction collection?  Three bookcases, 600 books, increasing
<br>
monthly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 6.  Diet must be taken into consideration too.  I wonder what this fellow eats?  I sure hope it is not the typical programmer diet of pizza and coke!
</em><br>
<p>Nope.  Cereal, prepackaged microwave meal, meat-based soup, daily vitamin
<br>
tablet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 7.  The physical safety of Eli is a key concern to all of us!  I want him only driving something BIG(or a volvo) so he will have a better chance of surviving a car wreck.
</em><br>
<p>Drive?  You mean, in a car and stuff?  What for?  I have Webvan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 8.  To enhance his mental powers Eli should check out alternative methods.
</em><br>
<p>There is no cause-and-effect relationship between processing the words &quot;You
<br>
are a better programmer&quot; and the sections of the brain that actually program
<br>
things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 9.  Eli must be so careful involving romantic entanglements!
</em><br>
<p>Waiting until after the Singularity works for me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 10. Wasting time on email lists could really be a problem for him!
</em><br>
<p>Where do you think Singularity Institutes come from, anyway?
<br>
