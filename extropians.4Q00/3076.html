Dear Mr. Irvine,
<br>
You say in your review of The Last Mortal Generation:
<br>
<em>&gt; True to the philosophy of materialism, the book's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis centres upon the physiology of ageing and death ... little time is spent on the psychology of old age, the immense psychospiritual changes (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting of wisdom?) that accompany old age and that may even be necessary to younger generations. Are we to believe that the reveries of old age,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the processes of looking back, of advising, of learning from experiences, of learning from the various stages of the life cycle, of learning to accept and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come to terms with death and its capacity to illuminate the meaning of life are to be dismissed as 'aspects of a disease' in the same way that Broderick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dismisses the physical changes associated with the same?
</em><br>
<p>This indicates that you have your own blinders on here. You seem to
<br>
assume that the wisdom acquired in old age is a consequence of the
<br>
individual slowly rotting away, and in coming to terms with one's
<br>
mortality, rather than as a consequence of the accumulation of one's
<br>
past experience actually LIVING life. While there is something to be
<br>
said for confronting one's mortality, the rot of old age does not result
<br>
in wisdom, its simply a pain, an impediment, and a source of suffering
<br>
that could and should be avoided. Humanists claim to seek to alleviate
<br>
suffering in this world, yet they refuse to admit that the greatest
<br>
amount of suffering is from old age. If you claim that wisdom results
<br>
from this suffering, then you cannot conversely claim that other sources
<br>
of suffering, like child abuse, scholastic, military, gender, religious,
<br>
and racial/ethnic hazing and discrimination, police torture and
<br>
imprisonment of criminals, are not all character building activities
<br>
that should also be accepted in our all too human world. By opposing
<br>
such suffering, you are thus opposed to creating greater wisdom in the
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>As this reducto ad absurdum demonstrates, the logic of old age related
<br>
suffering producing wisdom is false, or else your whole worldview is
<br>
false. Wisdom comes from experience. Becoming practically immortal
<br>
should thus result in greater wisdom in the world.
<br>
<p>Additionally, practical immortality is not total immortality. Even if
<br>
all diseases and old age are cured, unrepairable fatalities due to
<br>
accidents (particularly brain hemmorage or destruction) would result in
<br>
a life expectancy of approximately 4000 years, so there is still room
<br>
for one to come to terms with one's mortality, especially if one engages
<br>
in more risk filled activities.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Michael S. Lorrey
