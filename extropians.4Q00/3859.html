</em><br>
<p>Why, thank you!
<br>
<p>Perhaps this will all become clearer if I relate a story:  I was recently,
<br>
a few weeks back, waiting at an airport.  Next to me was a family, also
<br>
waiting - a mother, a very young boy (4 or 5), and a slightly older girl. 
<br>
The boy had five pennies.  He would lay them out on the table next to me,
<br>
in patterns - the one I saw was a star, a penny at the center and four
<br>
other pennies in a square around it - and then pick up the pennies again
<br>
and count them.  &quot;One, two, three, four, five.  I have five pennies.&quot;
<br>
<p>What would *you* have done?
<br>
<p>I, of course, took out my wallet, as unobtrusively as possible, and
<br>
extracted all the pennies - I had five.  I didn't have to do this part
<br>
completely invisibly, since there was no logical reason for the people
<br>
next to me to notice - there was no way they could know that I was taking
<br>
out pennies - but I did want to make sure there was nothing memorable
<br>
about the action.  Anyway, the next time the kid's back was turned - and
<br>
his mother and sister were looking away, of course - I carefully and
<br>
quietly put a penny on the table.  He noticed it, picked it up, added it
<br>
to his collection, and then counted.  &quot;One, two, three, four, five, six. 
<br>
I have six pennies.&quot;  Then he started to lay them out again.  Again, I
<br>
waited for my moment, then added another two pennies.  &quot;One, two, three,
<br>
four, five, six, seven, eight.  I have eight pennies.&quot;  He turned away and
<br>
started tugging on Mommy's sleeve.
<br>
<p>Boy:  &quot;Mommy, I have eight pennies.&quot;
<br>
Mommy (clearly not paying any attention):  &quot;That's nice, dear.&quot;
<br>
Eliezer (while boy's back is turned):  Adds another penny.
<br>
<p>His sister actually caught me at this point, but I managed to put a finger
<br>
to my lips - the silent &quot;Shhh!&quot; gesture - before she started laughing.  So
<br>
she just watched, though with a big smile on her face.
<br>
<p>Boy (counts again):  &quot;Mommy, I have nine pennies.&quot;
<br>
Mommy:  &quot;Uh huh.&quot;
<br>
<p>At this point I tried to add a tenth penny, but the boy turned around
<br>
before I was ready and caught me - he said &quot;Hey!&quot; - and we all started
<br>
laughing.
<br>
<p><p><p>What are *you* complaining about?  He got to keep the pennies.  My
<br>
original plan, if I hadn't been caught, was to go up to ten pennies and
<br>
then start stealing them until he was back down to five.  That would have
<br>
enlivened not just one day but the rest of his life.
