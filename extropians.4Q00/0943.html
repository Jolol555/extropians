<em>&gt; I wonder what the analagous effect of this assymmetry on political calculus

</em><br>
<p>This can be measured by measuring the size and strength of positive and negative
<br>
opinions of each candidate in a poll. The real numbers that political pollsters
<br>
look at is not the pap that is published in the media. What is of importance are
<br>
things like how 'firm' the support for a candidate versus his opponent, as well
<br>
as the average vector of undecideds making up their minds. Firmness is measured
<br>
by asking multiple choice questions when asking who a person will vote for,
<br>
asking if they a)possibly, b) probably, or c) definitely will vote for a
<br>
candidate. This firmness can also be measured in the negative opinion of a
<br>
candidate. A candidate may have 20% firm support, 25% soft support, but 35% firm
<br>
opposition, 10% soft opposition, and 10% undecided (that 45% firm opposition
<br>
does not neccessarily translate to 45% firm support for the opposing candidate).
<br>
A professional pollster then looks at trends in these various variables, coming
<br>
up with derivative trajectories for each, which he integrates together to make
<br>
one full caculation of who will win what percent of the vote on any given day.
<br>
<p>What is more difficult, and is considered more of an art among pollsters, is
<br>
measuring how outside events can change this dynamic: i.e. how candidates do in
<br>
a debate, if new scandals about candidates surface, how the media spins each
<br>
candidate to the public, as well as world events and economic trends. Dealing
<br>
with this is very much like Hari Seldon's Science of Psychohistory.
