<p><em>&gt;Hi Steve.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Boy, you are a slippery one.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;You're pretty good at &quot;not being wrong,&quot; ain'tcha?
</em><br>
<p>I prefer to be more positive and say &quot;being right!&quot;
<br>
<p>On:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I think you're reading too much into what I'm saying Steve.  Let's try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;keep this simple.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Assuming that everything is simple is a BIG mistake.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;You're right Steve.  So let's not assume that everything is simple.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;addition, at the other extreme, let us not practice the deliberate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obfuscation and/or avoidance of the issues by continual reference to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unknowability of all things.
</em><br>
<p>I think we should have as full information as practicable. This makes
<br>
choices more clear on the whole, and is not obfustification.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Can we agree that even in the absence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;purely predictable/deterministic properties, we, as cognizant beings, can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proceed anyway, and musn't be paralyzed with indecision?
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, but nor should we be too rash ... I am arguing for balance, not for
<br>
one side or the other on this empowerment question....
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;To be achingly clear:  all you're arguing here is that, for some reason,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that belief may NOT be limiting in this particular case.  Fine.  If you
</em><br>
hold
<br>
<em>&gt;that to be the case, then it's a bad example.  The point remains: we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;try to remove the genuinely limiting ideologies.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but this point is so banal and obvious, we all do it anyway. The devil
<br>
is in the detail.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Let me further refine my usage of the term limiting, lest you deliberately
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mis-interpret my intention (whoops, too late.)  The type of ideologies I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;talking about removing are the ones that limit the individual from
</em><br>
achieving
<br>
<em>&gt;'good things.'  (or increased utility, or however you want to define it.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You choose to argue the minutiae, &quot;oh no Jason, that's not a limiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideology for this and that such and such reasons.&quot;  Fine.  I agree the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consequences of actions and ideologies are debatable.  The point remains:
</em><br>
IF
<br>
<em>&gt;an ideology limits an individual from increasing utility, THEN it should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stripped away.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Read that sentence again, carefully.
</em><br>
<p>You do love to generalise ... I am trying to inject some gritty reality into
<br>
your speculations because I hate generalisations, particularly in
<br>
philosophy.
<br>
I think a better way of evaluating ideological propositions might be on
<br>
TRUTH value .... utility is an even more nebulous quantity, and my utility
<br>
might be to your detriment. Reject ideology because is false, not limiting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm not talking about -every- belief structure Steve, as the paragraph
</em><br>
above
<br>
<em>&gt;states in brutal, nay, shocking clarity.  Where do you get these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;counter-arguments from?  Why don't you just answer the question?  I won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hold it against you if you say yes.  If fact, it might re-assure me that
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt;weren't simply being difficult (whoops, too late.)
</em><br>
<p>I repeat, reject ideology because is false, not on grounds that it is
<br>
limiting.
<br>
True beliefs, such as that I am not superman or batman, are limiting, but
<br>
work.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I do not see your oversimplistic view as having any merit.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Fair enough.  You think things are complicated.  Mostly, they are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Situational and environmental modifiers rear their ugly heads.  However, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simple core truth remains, and I have personally reaped the benefits from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understanding it:  Humans often hold arbitrary beliefs that are negatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;limiting.  Humans should try to identify such beliefs and remove them (so
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt;to no longer be arbitrarily limited.)  Your protestations against this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'oversimplistic view' are argumentative and unhelpful.  The abstractions
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt;introduce to this discussion seem designed to preserve your authority over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the process of human therapy.  You don't need to do that-- I surrender to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your authority regarding the frequent complexity of procedure.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;- -I- however have luckily (and in the absence of expert advice) achieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whiz-bang results from the logical observation of my own limiting
</em><br>
ideologies
<br>
<em>&gt;and the subsequent removal thereof.  Still a work in progress, I am pleased
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to report that my level of personal empowerment is currently quite high.
</em><br>
<p>You are generalising from the particular in the same way that an evangelical
<br>
Christian gives their testimony .... Hallelujah, I have been saved, accept
<br>
God and
<br>
the same can happen for you ....
<br>
<p>Great, it works for you (or you have convinced yourself that it does
<br>
by auto-suggestion, same thing) and you wish to share this &quot;revelation&quot;.
<br>
Problem is, your formulae contains nothing new, is  just an naive
<br>
exhortation
<br>
to &quot;optimise.&quot; NLP is a huge system about remodelling &amp; changing your
<br>
meta-programming, getting rid of outworn habitual behaviour &amp;c. What are
<br>
you saying that adds to this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Desirable ends:  Removal of limiting belief structures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My limiting belief is that I am &quot;mortal&quot; and not superman which stops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me leaping from tall buildings ... this limiting belief is ESSENTIAL.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No need to strip anything way, just evaluate your actions/beliefs
</em><br>
sensibly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you *really* think this is what I meant by 'limiting', then I hope I
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt;addressed this above.
</em><br>
<p>Glad that I am continually forcing you to modify and qualify your position.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But, come on Steve.  Please.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You -are- looking to re-invent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;yourself as a posthuman entity, aren't you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, have been post-human a very long time already.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;What is a human?
</em><br>
<p>One of your so-called limiting belief structures .....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What is it about -you- that makes you &quot;not-a-human?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I have stripped away this limiting belief. Ha!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not a problem I have. I just don't altogether trust everyone else with it
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Ah, I see.  You don't trust other people who might empower themselves.
</em><br>
Fair
<br>
<em>&gt;enough.  So what's your strategy then?  Is it your intention to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other individuals from embracing rational self-empowerment?
</em><br>
<p>No, just to try and present them with fuller information so as to make
<br>
a more informed choice. Shame that you refuse to comprehend MVT, but
<br>
that is no loss to me ....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;The ability to dissolve one's ego is -also- an expression of personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This is a paradox/truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humility ... yes maybe what your Joe character was exhibiting?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;More likely its fear-- and the longer that Joe perpetuates this belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt;structure, the less likely that he'll actually sit down and do something:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;write his book, say hello to someone nice.  If he's lucky, he'll get
</em><br>
knocked
<br>
<em>&gt;out of this negative attractor state by a major situational modifier.
</em><br>
<p>Are you attempting to use psychobabble jargon to enhance your
<br>
own authority here? What evidence do you have for &quot;structure&quot; as opposed for
<br>
fairly ad hoc joblots of variable beliefs ..... most folks aren't very
<br>
structured.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;For instance, I'm totally incapable of recognizing how your above paragraph
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invalidates (or even remotely addresses) my statement that: &quot;Environments
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have decreased relevancy to our existence if we don't actually get to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;mentally interface&quot; with them.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Mentally interface&quot; presumably means &quot;think about them.&quot; We have
<br>
infinite-state
<br>
capability so can think about, or imagine, any environments we want. Cite
<br>
Leibnitz &quot;all possible worlds.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In fact, to my painfully addled intellect, your above paragraph appears to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be an attempt at tangential obfuscation by authority-- and seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demonstrate an unwillingness to agree with (or engage) a relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;innocuous statement.
</em><br>
<p>What makes you say only &quot;relatively&quot; innocuous.
<br>
What potential dangers do you see?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Perhaps, in deference to my ignorance regarding &quot;E-1 non-primal-eye
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infinite-state self-organizing&quot; brain theory, you could (in detail) explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how said terms increase the relevancy of environments that we don't
</em><br>
actually
<br>
<em>&gt;get to mentally interface with.
</em><br>
<p>See points I made previously. You cannot deny that our brains are (1) E-1,
<br>
or
<br>
(2) are self-organising, or (3) are infinite-state (as opposed to mu- or
<br>
finite-state.
<br>
MVT is based on scientifically repeatable experiments and observations
<br>
from nature. Your &quot;theory&quot; is just a personalised lingoistic generalisation.
<br>
MVT does explain the mechanisms of all mentation, including dreams.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It is overzealous evangelisers that cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If their &quot;limiting beliefs&quot; get the Amish or whoever thru
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life .. they aren't complaining ... it is your inflexibility/purism of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that creates the problem here, not the poor Amish.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Dude!  I'm not judging the Amish.  Hey, I say: &quot;Go Amish!&quot;  I -love- the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Amish!
</em><br>
<p>But, as pro-science Extropians and what-not, we automatically
<br>
are proposing a future radically at odds with the Amish vision ....
<br>
and therefore must be able to make a strong case for advancement
<br>
rather than comfortable stasis (along with its limiting, religious beliefs).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;But, you'll grant (I hope, dear God, I hope) that if a particular Amish
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wants to, oh... visit Mir for instance, he/she has some ideological hurdles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to overcome.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; We all live in trance!
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, if we -all- live in trance, then so what?  It's irrelevant if there
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt;no such thing as &quot;NOT-trance.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>There are various depths of trance .. from wakefulness, through daydreams,
<br>
to deep catatonic somnambulism. But, yes, all mentation is &quot;hallucination&quot;
<br>
even if fairly mundane such as the hallucination of our internal voice
<br>
(thought).
<br>
MVT explains this (naturally, I would say that,but happens to be the case).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; let me ask you a question ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can use MVT to devise new types of hypnotic induction (mind control).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should I use these techniques to promote my own agenda or not?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, if you want to place the agenda of self-empowerment into an ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;context
</em><br>
<p>An 'actual' not 'ethical context' ......
<br>
<p><em> &gt;(I touched on this briefly with my 'spirit of compassion'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statements,) then I'll have to state that I am pretty much a utilitarian.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As much utility as possible, for as many people as possible, for as long as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, I will be very beneficent, and put them in a &quot;better&quot; state of mind.
<br>
More people will be happier, therefore you think I should do it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, if you're asking, do I agree with ALL forms of personal empowerment,
</em><br>
my answer is a definitive no.  I'm a big fan of lots of them, however.
<br>
<p>Aha, so you are building qualifiers into your initial statement. You haven't
<br>
answered my specific case of the mind-control induction though.
<br>
<p>By the way, MVT is the way to make conscious machines , so I changed
<br>
the thread name again .. sorry for any confusion.
