<p>I can't recall having put forth objections against that particular

point, but if I ever did, I was obviously mistaken. 
<br>
<p>While I wouldn't bet my life on it, this seems one of the punctuated

equlibrium things if I ever saw one since the primeval autocatalystic

set (which must also have burned like wildfire through the prebiotic

ursoup).

I don't consciously recall that periode, but the Hansonians are very
<br>
probably wrong. Unless we both are wrong, of course.

<p><em> &gt; &gt; Only then it radiates.

<p>It is one of these emergent properties. As soon as you're in a
<br>
Darwinian regime you can't do otherwise. As soon you have to copy
<br>
things imperfectly in face of limited resources you're there. 
<br>
<p>I do not see how you can break out sustainably from Darwinian regime,
<br>
having to originate in it and being surrounded by it from all places,
<br>
including stuff emerging in your very own belly. You say you can strip
<br>
it, using the initial explosive growth, and due to absolutely highest
<br>
fitness (there is no such thing, because fitness function is strongly
<br>
dominated by other individuals in population) kick any darwinian
<br>
design's ass, whether coming crawling in from the outside (or you
<br>
sailing smack into a domain of it in your sysop cloning expansion), or
<br>
spontaneously emerged inside (prevented by exquisite brittleness, I
<br>
would imagine).
<br>
<p>I dunno, no offense, but this sounds ridiculous to me.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; subgoal of personal survival, a subgoal of happiness, a subgoal of attempting
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to maximize any internal programmatic state, or a subgoal of trying to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; maximize any physical state in the external Universe.  Phylum radiation is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; cognitively plausible only if the SI possesses an explicit drive for
</em><br>
<em> &gt; reproduction and diversification at the expense of its own welfare.
</em><br>
<p>This presumes the seed never ceases to be a monode during its growth,
<br>
and stops growing after it has reached a certain spatial
<br>
dimension. (Of course, the chiefest objection is how you make that
<br>
seed to grow, and how do you keep it from going off in other places
<br>
you don't want, while the thing is out of your hands). Since this
<br>
clearly limits its sphere of influence, it either keeps everybody
<br>
tucked in, or has to make a remote clone of itself, creating a
<br>
population of SIs. By keeping it brittle, the clone never grows
<br>
malign, and by design it never infringes on other sysop's domain.
<br>
<p>Lots of complex assumptions there.
