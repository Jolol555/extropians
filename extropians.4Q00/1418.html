<em>&gt;From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:retroman@turbont.net?Subject=Re:%20Really%20my%20last%20comment%20on%20PI%20in%20the%20Bible&In-Reply-To=&lt;000201c03b81$71d6dae0$0200a8c0@fraser.psn.net&gt;">retroman@turbont.net</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Actually, since pre decimal societies expressed non-integers as fractions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instead,
</em><br>
<p>Yes they did sometimes, to varying degrees of precision. Which degree
<br>
of precision do you require Michael? to the nearest half? third? sixty
<br>
fourth?
<br>
What makes you think you have the right to decide the expressed precision,
<br>
post facto? It is expressed in cubits, no fractions given, so it seems
<br>
reasonable
<br>
to assume &quot;to the nearest cubit&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and since both the greeks and egyptians and Babylonians had all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;calculated pi to a far greater degree of both accuracy and precision,
</em><br>
<p>You see, I find this point interesting. If this man Hiram truly did know
<br>
PI to such a degree of precision, you would think he was smart enough to
<br>
record the size accurately. However, the fact that he did not give the
<br>
obvious answer (31 cubits) but rather gave one that is within the bounds
<br>
of possibility seems to me to add to the veracity not subtract. Especially
<br>
since this is not a math problem, but a statement of his (or more
<br>
specifically
<br>
the writer's) perception of reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Which makes the object an ellipse, NOT a circle. Since the biblican passage
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt;question specified a fixed diameter of ten cubits, then it follows that we
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt;talking about a circle, and NOT an ellipse.
</em><br>
<p>Neither the word diameter nor the word circle are used in the passage.
<br>
The diameter is assumed to be the measure &quot;from rim to rim&quot;, and the
<br>
shape is designated as round, which does not denote a mathematically
<br>
perfect circle. My dictionary defines it as &quot;approximately circular.&quot;
<br>
I doubt the Biblical writers were familiar with, or have vocabulary for,
<br>
conic sections.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Who was allegedly responsible for designing the Temple of Solomon, and
</em><br>
given
<br>
<em>&gt;what is known about architectural knowledge of the region and time, we know
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt;someone like Hiram actually knew of a far more accurate calculation of pi.
</em><br>
<p>But he wasn't calculating pi was he? He was simply stating the dimensions
<br>
of the object he had made. You are the only one calculating pi.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The original topic was to demonstrate that the Bible is NOT the word of
</em><br>
god,
<br>
<em>&gt;which is a concept that apparently some people have a memetic disposition
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt;disputing...
</em><br>
<p>You are free to dispute it, as am I. However, I suggest you find something
<br>
more substantial than this mathematical fallacy.
<br>
<p>If you want to prove it, prove BOTH your assumptions are correct (with some
<br>
method other than hand waving.) One, that the precision intended was greater
<br>
than that expressed, and two, that the object was circular to a precision
<br>
to exclude the veracity of the numbers given.
<br>
<p>I'm afraid it is you who is showing the memetic disposition to dis anything
<br>
in
<br>
the book, without giving it a fair consideration.
