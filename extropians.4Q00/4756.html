I did some preliminary design work on one of those quite a while back. I
<br>
called it a C_MOUSE.
<br>
Never implemented. The cats I've tested electric-motor toys on didn't
<br>
seem to like them much. Upbringing might make a difference, but I
<br>
suspect gears and other noise and ozone smell and size makes them more
<br>
scary than attractive. I want to use compressed air, but the tech isn't
<br>
quite there yet.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have a cat, and playing with her is rather ... demanding. Like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small child, she makes up rules as she goes along. Sometimes it's simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chase-the-string stuff ... but she varies her hunting pattern considerably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and gets bored if I just drag it in front of her. And sometimes she tries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to play head-games with the people around her. For example, she's got a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominance game where every time a human gets out of their chair she'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leap into it and sprawl out, taking posession: as if to assert her own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to occupy human territory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wouldn't claim that she's as complex as a human being, but I suspect a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robot behaviourally complex enough to keep her amused would need to be at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least as smart as a dog or cat. (Unless it was mouse-sized, furry, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed to scoot into dark corners and squeak.)
