<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Sorry Harvey, I just don't accept claims of widespread rural bigotry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I'm not certain what level of rural bigotry Harvey was claiming,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the record, I was not claiming any specific level of rural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bigotry.  I was objecting to the claim that bigotry was a city
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem and that rural areas were naturally free from bigotry.
</em><br>
<p>I never said they were free from it. I said that they tended to be far
<br>
less so distrustful of others than city people are of other city people.
<br>
In the time I've lived in Seattle, Tacoma, Lowell, and elsewhere, I met
<br>
far more crooks, con artists, shysters, liars, and general pricks in the
<br>
city than I have in the whole time I've lived in the country, and that
<br>
most city dwellers have a far higher level of distrust of other people,
<br>
though this does seem to be affected by one's socio-economic level.
