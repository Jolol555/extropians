<p>
Eugene,
<br>
<p>Sorry for the lengthy answer...It was hard to keep this short.
<br>
<p>I'm certainly not going to argue with you, because you do feel
<br>
that we should eventually go into space.  You're an extropian, 
<br>
after all...
<br>
<p>The main point I want to make is that the &quot;humans in space budget&quot; 
<br>
is already there, and being used (shuttle, ISS, SLI is next). NASA 
<br>
is not competing for rice money.  It just needs to be redirected.
<br>
It comes from a totally different budget.  No more, or less, are 
<br>
people going to starve if we go to Mars.  NASA is going to damn 
<br>
well make sure they keep that money tied up in SOMETHING, in 
<br>
case they REALLY need it someday - in  case of war, or whatever.  
<br>
<p>It would be nice if low Earth orbit could be  commercialized 
<br>
(a long shot nowadays - there are no markets yet) and the money 
<br>
redirected to an area that needs a hell of a lot of research, like 
<br>
you say.  NASA should be doing research, after all, not operations.  
<br>
We don't want to spend our tax dollars paying an overly expensive 
<br>
landlord for the ISS, watching our tax dollars circle the Earth, 
<br>
endlessly.
<br>
<p>We've already sent people to the Moon several times, and could go 
<br>
to Mars today if we only had a Saturn V.  But you're right, if we want 
<br>
to make it a sustained presence from the beginning, we need a hell 
<br>
of a lot of research.  The Mars Society, with private funding (no
<br>
rice money here) have built a Mars Arctic Research Station in the 
<br>
Canadian high arctic and are living in Mr. Zubrin's first &quot;tuna can&quot;.  
<br>
No all out simulation yet, but over the next few summers it will 
<br>
become more and more of a real simulation with spacesuits and 
<br>
recycling.  It's just as much about learning how people will actually 
<br>
work together in that situation, as the actual details of &quot;staying 
<br>
alive&quot; are contemplated as well.  <a href="http://arctic.marssociety.org/">http://arctic.marssociety.org/</a>
<br>
<p>The team leader, Pascal Lee, just spent two days at Hamilton space 
<br>
suit company trying on a more flexible suit to take to the island.  
<br>
Hamilton is actively working on a brand new &quot;Mars&quot; suits, and 
<br>
Pascal demonstrated to them last week, that in the current version 
<br>
it is impossible to even pick up rocks.  It would be hard to make 
<br>
rubber skin space suits, as you say, because remember, a space 
<br>
suit is actually a mini space capsule, not just warm pressurized long 
<br>
johns.  But anyway, they do need a lot of work, for sure.  Plus, 
<br>
space suits only last for several days on the Moon - they weren't 
<br>
built for long durations.  There are lots of problems with them, 
<br>
and with the rovers too - intelligent rovers are being designed 
<br>
but are certainly not there yet.  
<br>
<p>Probably one of the strongest links in the chain is the art of making 
<br>
breathable air and fuel from local recources.  We know how to 
<br>
turn the Martian atmosphere into oxygen and fuel - it's pratically 
<br>
chemistry 101.  Basically, a small amount of hydrogen would be 
<br>
brought to Mars, and then through what's called the &quot;Sabatier 
<br>
reation&quot;, methane and water is produced from carbon dioxide 
<br>
(the atmosphere) ane hydrogen.  The reaction is endothermic 
<br>
and will occur spontaneously in the presence of a nickel or 
<br>
rutghenium catalyst.  Thank goodness they're finding more water
<br>
on Mars because it is extremely difficult to extract water 
<br>
from rocks, like you said.  Water is probably the weakest link 
<br>
in the chain, unless these supposed water/ice deposits are real, 
<br>
and big.
<br>
<p>The zillions of other technical difficulties that need to be 
<br>
researched are going to take some time, which is exactly why we 
<br>
want NASA to initiate a human to Mars program now.  Then maybe 10 
<br>
or 20 years down the road, we can actually go.  Initiating a human 
<br>
to Mars program doesn't mean getting in a tuna can and GOING, it 
<br>
means initiating a massive research program that needs to be done, 
<br>
with the goal of getting there.  Why now?  The United States has 
<br>
never been better prepared to do this, and if we wait too long, you 
<br>
never know what the situation with this country will be. (I realise 
<br>
some of you are not from the U.S., bear with me).  There is no 
<br>
cold war to help justify such a program, and no kingship - so we 
<br>
can't just do it for glamour, and we're not going to convince the 
<br>
president to do this because we feel it's a good &quot;social cause&quot;, or 
<br>
that we are &quot;explorers&quot; or any of the REAL reasons we want to go.  
<br>
The only reason I can think of that might fly with the congress is 
<br>
to send humans there to do some hardcore science - Learn about Mars 
<br>
in order to understand more about the Earth - Possibly find Martian 
<br>
life and then learn whether or not it is related to Earth life 
<br>
(probably so...).  And we DO need the delicate touch and intuition
<br>
of humans to find fossils and the best possible rocks to study. We
<br>
cannot, to this day, find dinasaur fossils with robots alone.
<br>
<p>Oh, believe me, most space activists are not so optimistic.  They
<br>
argue amongst themselves like you wouldn't believe.  Most actually
<br>
have common sense.  The visionaries - the leaders - the ones that
<br>
activists follow like army ants, probably do have common sense, 
<br>
but only stick to the more positive scenarios in order to rally 
<br>
their troups.  They are by no means PRACTICAL, however, which
<br>
was my whole point to begin with.  
<br>
<p>I assure you, none of these people want to take rice away from 
<br>
children.  They want to inspire children.
<br>
<p>Okay.
<br>
<p>For once, since I became a space fanatic, I have noticed that the
<br>
highly disjointed excuse for a pro-space movement suddenly fits
<br>
together like a slightly awkward, funky looking puzzle.  But at 
<br>
least the pieces sort of fit together now, unlike before.  For 
<br>
instance, now that there are five or so commercial Moon missions 
<br>
being planned for the next several years (a miracle, no less...but 
<br>
we'll see if any of them actually happen; TransOrbital,  LunaCorp, 
<br>
Applied Space Recources, and then the secretive ones) to send 
<br>
simple but functioning spacecraft to the Moon, and the Artemis 
<br>
society has a 'commercial' humans to the Moon plan...and all of 
<br>
these folks have joined under a blanket society called the &quot;Moon 
<br>
Society&quot;.  It seems the &quot;moon folks&quot; don't want the US government's 
<br>
money anymore.  In fact, they hope that by the time they send 
<br>
cameras and rovers to the Moon, NASA will be out of the way.  
<br>
These companies are going to need to sell their pictures and 
<br>
services, and if NASA keeps giving away new pictures for free, 
<br>
it won't work.  
<br>
<p>So, even the Moon people want NASA's money to be diverted to 
<br>
Mars - if for nothing else but to get NASA out of their way.  A little 
<br>
sarcasm there, but still...Moon and Mars activists are no longer 
<br>
competing for that big sum of money.  For once, in a long time, we 
<br>
can all come together on capital hill and at least &quot;pretend&quot; we are 
<br>
a gigantic pro-space movement, but in the public eye, it will 
<br>
inspire kids and educational institutions to think more about our 
<br>
opportunities and future in space.  That's what our March for Space 
<br>
is about <a href="http://www.marchforspace.com">http://www.marchforspace.com</a>.  I'm leading this venture, 
<br>
and I have already traded my heart in for a stone in order to pull 
<br>
this one off.  It's extremely idealistic, but I know it can work.  
<br>
<p>One day out of the year we can stand side by side - no one has to 
<br>
kiss or hug, just stand there and look proud. If anyone wants to 
<br>
help with my March for Space venture, please make your voice heard.  
<br>
We have some prestigious sponsors already, but will need a lot more 
<br>
volunteer help.  It's an ongoing thing, that will hopefully develop 
<br>
into a bigger and bigger march every year.  We'll have actors 
<br>
there, and bands, and famous scientists...it will be fun.  Fun, fun 
<br>
fun!
<br>
<p>Sorry to leave the asteroid and O'Neill folks out of this 
<br>
discussion, but that just gets too complicated.
<br>
<p><p>Onward and outward,
<br>
-Elaine
