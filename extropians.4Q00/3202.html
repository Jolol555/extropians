<em>&gt; There are a variety of reasons for suicide, but they all seem to stem from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressure based situations.  However, it could be argued that what is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressure situation to one person could be handled rather easily by
</em><br>
another.
<br>
<em>&gt;  If this is true, then I don't foresee the &quot;all will perish&quot; scenario
</em><br>
being
<br>
<em>&gt; statistically plausible.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not saying that it will be necessarily self performed, but as I've
<br>
already stated in that same post, there will still be the matter of
<br>
accidents, conflicts, and cosmic events.  Yes, our survival potential will
<br>
increase greatly, perhaps exponentially.  But in order to guarantee
<br>
immortality, this survival potential would have to reach infinity- which it
<br>
never will.
<br>

<p>&quot;We do progress, but how?  Not by the tinkering of the meliorist; not by the
<br>
crushing of initiative; not by laws and regulations which hamstring the
<br>
racehorse, and handcuff the boxer; but by the innovations of the eccentric,
<br>
by the phantasies of the hashish-dreamer of philosophy, by the aspirations
<br>
of the idealist to the impossible, by the imagination of the revolutionary,
<br>
by the perilous adventure of the pioneer.  Progress is by leaps and bounds,
<br>
by breaking from custom, by working on untried experiments; in short, by the
<br>
follies and crimes of men of genius, only recognizable as wisdom and virtue
<br>
after they have been tortured to death, and their murderers reap gloatingly
<br>
the harvest of the seeds they sowed at midnight.&quot; -Aleister Crowley, &quot;On
<br>
Original Sin&quot;
