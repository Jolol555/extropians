<p><em>&gt; Altho no one should ever undergo cryonic suspension *against* their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will, in the case of a murder victim who never heard of the technique,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would favor suspending the victim.  My reasoning is this: I suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that when we freeze the piece of meat that is running one's mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs, that piece of meat will never be successfully thawed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, that piece of meat may eventually be raised to perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -5C and read by nanobots into some sort of machine that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulate that program.  It seems to me that under those circs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we could figure out a way to control the pain.
</em><br>
<p>Well, of course this is all conjecture, so *if* any of this actually transpires,
<br>
then the ultra-compassionate SI that figures out a way to control the pain,
<br>
could also just upload the victim retro-actively by going back in time. (Hey, if
<br>
we can simulate the deceased mind, who knows, maybe we can simulate time
<br>
travel.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nowthen, it *is* a hell of a good question, however.  There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain types of pain that will be difficult or perhaps impossible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control.  If I reanimate, I already know the very first thing I will do:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will sit down and weep: for all the people that I have ever loved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and cared about, most of them will be lost forever.  The heartache
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I will feel on that day is *nearly* enough to convince me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not *want* to face it, even if I get eternal existence in return.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I think that it will probably be a good trade-off, and so would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favor suspending a person whose will is unknown.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, parting with loved ones is such Sweet Achy-Breaky Heart Sorrow (tm). But
<br>
extropy requires us to be strong enough to withstand the slings and arrows of
<br>
Outrageous Eternally Recurring Fortune (tm), so... Onward! Upward! Full speed
<br>
ahead.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As it turns out, that was one of my biggest problems when I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still a believer in Religion Inc: that waking up in heaven would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the saddest experience imaginable, because of those who were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not there.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I know what you mean... There we'd be in heaven... Not even knowing each
<br>
other... with all these sanctimonious goody-two-shoes types... what a drag...
<br>
and forever! ...it's not like we could change the channel or anything... how
<br>
dull... but heavenly dull of course... pshaw! ...what kind of Supercilious
<br>
Ignoramus (SI) tm would dream up a scenario like that... not much imagination
<br>
...must o' been some wine-swilling bishop lush with no original ideas
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Cryonic reanimation will likely be just as bad, if not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse, for there are damn few cryonauts, far too few, and of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course I think the world of you who are, I hope we will be best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of friends, but honestly, you will never replace my grandfather,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and he is gone forever.
</em><br>
<p>Mine too. I miss him... he was such a gentle man.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, JR, do the murder victims get suspended against their will?  No.
</em><br>
<p>Good. Too expensive anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do they get suspended if their will is unknown?  Yes.
</em><br>
<p>Assuming their families can pay, of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should murderers get the chance to have cryonic suspension, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if their victims are lost forever?  I think they should, yes.  I am a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reluctant proponent of capital punishment, but I do not propose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we deny the recipient last rites by the clergy of their choice, nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do I propose denying them suspension if they want it.  Certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not propose suspending the prisoner against the prisoner's will.
</em><br>
<p>What about traitors? Serial rapists? Spys? Tobacco company executives?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, I suspect that the first successful cryonic reanimation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be on an executed prisoner, for there you would have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unique example of a corpsicle that was likely young and healthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when she underwent the suspension, perhaps making the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; configuration easier to read.   What say ye?  spike
</em><br>
<p>I say you may be on to something there. BTW, did you know the first Visual Human
<br>
Project specimen was a convicted felon? Did you know he had only one testicle?
<br>
(Who knows... it might be a question on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire)
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
