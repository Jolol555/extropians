<p>That doesn't make it genetically imposed. It only means that the imprinting is
<br>
very powerful. You can't stop being English language proficient if you wanted to
<br>
either (not that you'd want to). IOW, if you wanted to *not* understand what
<br>
someone says in English, could you stop understanding English? Nope.
<br>
Likewise, you could not stop being straight if you wanted to.

</em><br>
<p>Do you really? How do you know it's &quot;reluctance&quot; rather than knowing better?
<br>
&quot;I understand the reluctance to entertain the possibility that purple triffids
<br>
control the world's telephone networks&quot; says the triffid-meister on an
<br>
imaginative tangent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That implies that all those creepy evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychologists have been more right than we like to admit and gender isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as much of a social construct was we would like it to be.
</em><br>
<p>It's not a matter of socially constructing gender. The topic under consideration
<br>
is sexual orientation, and that includes both sexes. Whether you are male or
<br>
female *is* a matter of biology. Which sex you find most attractive is
<br>
determined by psychological imprinting.
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Those who fear and oppose the possible evolution of superhuman intelligence
<br>
ignore the reality of human resistance to enlightenment. First become
<br>
enlightened, and the real danger of ordinary human insanity, in all its tribal
<br>
absurdity, becomes clear. We have nothing to fear from our machines, and
<br>
everything to fear from our biological lust for power.&quot;
