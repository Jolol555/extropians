<p>Ohhhh boyyyyy. You really are not thinking of the US military's shining
<br>
successes in Vietnam and Somalia, to name a big one and a small one. One
<br>
could just as easily reformulate the status quo as &quot;The US population
<br>
approves of the suspension of its rights and will continue to do so
<br>
until things get as bad here(/someplace) as they were in Chechnya.&quot; In
<br>
that case, things turn into &quot;Every member of the force of US troops
<br>
enforcing martial law out on leave exists at the sufferance of every
<br>
streetwalker with a hatpin/kid with a rock/...&quot;
<br>
<p>We've got a moderately long way to go before anybody but the wild-eyed
<br>
thinks that's transpired, as long as everyone who has a 401k is happy.
<br>
Actual martial law might put a crimp in that.
<br>
<p>That said, consider that some fairly reliable sources suggest that, to
<br>
name a high profile example, some people suggest that the active
<br>
membership of the IRA (the Irish one, not another financial instrument)
<br>
at its peak might have numbered 200 souls or so.
<br>
<p>Stimulating a disproportionate inappropriate reply in force is part of
<br>
the standard tactics of low-intensity/insurgent/guerilla politics/war.
<br>
So if, hypothetically, the heat ever gets turned up on the US population
<br>
in general, and the &quot;sufferance&quot; of which you speak turns to more
<br>
obvious _suffering_, it still won't in all likelihood be the general
<br>
population (appearing to be) doing the fighting. But the idea of
<br>
fighting pitched battles with &quot;fronts&quot; and so forth is terribly
<br>
last-century.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<p>Most people 'round here are not in a rat-eating mood; that's about the
<br>
size of it. May it ever be thus, for _good_ reason. Readers of this
<br>
Echelon transcript, please note this paragraph. I am not in rat-eating
<br>
mode, either.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Another consideration is that nanotech and AI may eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the relevance of firearms.  That may be true one of these days
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but we are not there now.  We may someday live in utopia but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think there is a good chance that even after nanotech and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AI we will still have a need for self-defense (perhaps even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more so).  Firearms may someday cease to be relevant but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; combat mentality and concepts that you learn will still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; apply.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, actually the whole idea is that nanotech/AI/superintelligence scenario is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopefully alien enough to eliminate even the need for self-defensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking.  My own philosophy is that the future is so distant - not just in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms of the environment, but in terms of who we will be - that the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course is to try and be the most intense human you can be, here and now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without moping too much over how much better you would be if you didn't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be human.  Arguably, firearms - and to an even greater extent, martial arts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - are a part of that.  The question, as always, is time.
</em><br>
<p>Cheerio. The one rhetorical card I see you palming in the above is &quot;the
<br>
whole idea&quot; s/b &quot;my [Eliezer's] whole idea&quot;. :) You're still doing 'way
<br>
better than most politicians.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Finally, I have a hunch.  It's just an idea and it may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; apply to everyone.  It's only something I feel and I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even sure it applies to me yet.  I think really knowing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you can defend yourself is good for your energy level and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; peace of mind.  It may be a biological effect of vigorous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and complex physical training. [...]  It may also be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that our brains also still respond to a pecking order system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which recognizes self-defense ability as a key dominance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trait.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep, that's the one.
</em><br>
<p>It can also be read as &quot;I have a handle on a piece of what the Universe
<br>
can dish out, insofar as I am able.&quot;
