<p><em> &gt; I'm very aware what the anthropic principle is-- which is the reason I
</em><br>
<em> &gt; pretty much ignored your use of it.  A few questions:
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Perhaps you shouldn't have.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; If dolphins were intelligent, would this be a two blip, or a one blip?  Why?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
1+x blip, if hominization and cetaceanisation were completely
<br>
independant. The second blip would be still tighly coupled to whatever
<br>
special conditions may be present in our neck of the woods, hence the
<br>
x uncertainty. Notice that emergence of a second sentient species in
<br>
the same habitat is highly improbable, because both also couple --
<br>
aquatic species is a good choice of yours (unfortunately, making tools
<br>
underwater is very hard).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; If we discover a lost African tribe next week, is this a two blip, or a one
</em><br>
<em> &gt; blip?  Why?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Still one blip, of course. We're talking about people, not even
<br>
intelligent aquatic species.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Do you believe that the anthropic principle is a &quot;good enough&quot; answer as to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the origin of existence?
</em><br>
<p>Huh? We started this with talking about explanations to Fermi's
<br>
paradoxon. Instead of choosing the straightforward solution -- we are
<br>
not in an advanced culture's lightcone -- you suggested that our
<br>
existance is a proof that there are other cultures out there. I
<br>
objected that a single blip proves nothing due to anthropic
<br>
principle. The anthropic principle has nothing whatsoever to do with
<br>
the origin of life, it's just a measurement bias.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Do you believe that real world science should treat the (strong) anthropic
</em><br>
<em> &gt; principle as a fundamental truth?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what you mean by strong AP. And of course you have to be
<br>
aware of measurement biases in real sciences.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; In what way do you feel that the anthropic principle biases our universe to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the emergence of only *one* intelligence?  There is a pleasing synergy
</em><br>
<p>Huh? That's a rather strange interpretation. All AP says is that a
<br>
single blip does not give you any constraints on life nucleation
<br>
density, because the measurement process is coupled to the measured
<br>
observable. As soon as there is a second data point, this bias is
<br>
broken.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; between multiverse theories and the (weak) anthropic principle.  We are,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; necessarily, in one of the universes that is capable of creating life.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Doesn't that really make discussions of the anthropic principle moot?
</em><br>
<p>You're not seeing that the anthropic principle is also applicable to
<br>
the Fermi paradoxon, not just the &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot; thing.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Aren't we still pointed at the same fundamental fact: we live in a universe
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that is capable of creating life?
</em><br>
<p>Necessary but not sufficient if we're talking about estimating
<br>
advanced culture nucleation density. Cyanobacteria need not apply.
