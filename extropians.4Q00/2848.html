<em>&gt; &gt; Body modifications of infants unable to make decisions happen quite

<em>&gt; Yes. A much more nontrivial effect is in utreo surgery, where surgery

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is of course old territory in bioethics, but I would like to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if a consistent transhumanist or extropian theory could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed. I think that, based on the principles, we have the seeds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for building some good ethics and politics for grownups but where we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really need to develop some new stuff is in these murky areas where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuality, selfhood and potentiality interact in tricky ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; About lawsuits, people generally have the right to raise their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; children how they would, there are certain rules about abuse and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; neglect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly. So what standards should we transhumanists suggest? I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is fairly clear that we would consider it abuse if changes or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upbringing limited or negated the possibility of the child developing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a full human being, able to fulfill its potential etc. But what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about minor nastiness, like religious icons on the forehead, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radical changes that the parents could claim did not even produce a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human in need of protection (&quot;It is my body, dammit, and I use it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacture sentient biocomputer parts if I want to!&quot;). Sure, these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later possibilities are not very likely to be common, but they show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tricky problems a transhumanist bioethics must be able to deal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with.
</em><br>

<p>I think all porn should be archived in the Internet Porn Gallery.  Besides
<br>
that, everything should be archived, so the Internet is as well the
<br>
Permanent Graffiti Wall.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Anyways, at some point we can tell the computer what enzymes we want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and thus print RNA to make them, in the comfort of our own homes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Thus any demyelinization of the neuron could be stopped, as well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any tumors proactively prevented, and cells' multiplication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; delimited.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In theory, yes. But the devil lurks in the details - protein folding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a hard problem, and even if you could design an enzyme for doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function A it is hard to see if it is also going to have unforeseen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect B. Not to mention that this relies on fairly mature technology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essentially biological nanotechnology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I hear the Geometric Algebras (Clifford Algebras) can be more expressive
<br>
than vector and tensor calculation, which is otherwise exceedingly useful
<br>
for computational problems.
<br>
<p>I have only seen some of the news video of the protein folding.  There is
<br>
valence stretching which was not taught to me, although I would call it a
<br>
pendulum (vectored spring).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As soon as the zygote is fertilized, and then it multiplies, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is the genome for that future person, if it is born.  If the gene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; absolutely predicts massive congenital birth defects, it is perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better to use a different fertilized zygote that has a better chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of a happy development and maturity.  As soon as the zygote is then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; manipulated, then it too easily leads to the spiral of eugenics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which in itself is not bad (unless one believes that it is important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to maintain an unchanged genome). When it becomes bad is when it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used coercively or to implement somebody else's views of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitutes a human bein instead of the parents. Of course, some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critics would say that even having parents chose genes is coercion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the child (I don't buy that argument; the child does not exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at that point, it is just a potentiality for a person - rights appear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as it grows up. But that should not be a reason for prenatal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistreatment).

<p>What if they were just immediately given the chance to know why, such as a
<br>
debilitating genetically inherited condition, so if they wanted to know why
<br>
they could know, and more fully experience the perhaps more survivable
<br>
version.  It is perhaps macabre talk, or not.  What that means is:  the
<br>
experiences form themselves.
