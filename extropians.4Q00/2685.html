Big Deal versus Bigtime: When Billy or Gore bogarted, and W'ya snorted; they 
<br>
were YOUNG MEN. Then needs to be a sort of largesse' when one is young and 
<br>
foolish.
<br>
<p>Regards defeating a Soviet Missile attack using 1980 technology, you jump to 
<br>
conclusion, I feel. Let us define the goal and then define the technology. 
<br>
The main avenue of attack was to defeat the Communist Party CCCP--that is the 
<br>
&quot;unacceptable damage&quot; that military experts have judged. 
<br>
<p>Now there were a few methods we might have tried and did not, to defeat an 
<br>
attack--even given the technology of the time. It's probably better to have 
<br>
had no successful missile defense system, as things happened, but to say it 
<br>
was unworkable because Sagan demurred or Kostia Tsipis, found it 
<br>
disagreeable; is no reason to propagandize against it. Hence, one could find 
<br>
such democratic-socialist like Dyson, give a different spin on things.  
<br>
<p>For a variety of reasons, 90% because the Politics changed we do not have a 
<br>
Balistic Missile Defense system. Not because the technology was inherently 
<br>
wrong. Will you also now say that we do not drive around on fuel cells or 
<br>
have a lunar colony &quot;because the technology didn't work&quot;? No, these are 
<br>
decisions, wise or unwise; and its all the road not taken. Sagan had his 
<br>
biases, as do I, as do you.
