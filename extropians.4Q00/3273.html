<em>&gt;Don't you believe it! Conservative parties are all about control. They'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cut spending (maybe), but it'll be in social welfare areas... public health,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;public housing, welfare, education, all the good stuff. The war on drugs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the military, the police... well, someone's gotta keep all those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disenfranchised scum in line, no?
</em><br>
<p>AFAIK, George Bush's plan for military expenditure is actually less 
<br>
than Al Gore's.  GWB's plan also includes withdrawing from 
<br>
non-conflict uses of the military.  Libertarians want a military that 
<br>
can protect US property rights, so I don't see where the military is 
<br>
necessarily an evil for Libertarians.  Ditto with the police.
<br>
<p>Spending less on social welfare programs like public housing and 
<br>
welfare are actually Libertarian goals, so no problem there.
<br>
<p>The war on drugs is rightfully criticized, but I'd rather work on 
<br>
that one issue than have to deal with the Democratic positions on all 
<br>
of the issues that you mentioned above.  Every issue's Democratic 
<br>
position is the opposite of the Libertarian's: social spending is a 
<br>
good thing for Democrats, the war on drugs has continued under 
<br>
Clinton (even from '93 - '95 when Dems also controlled the Congress), 
<br>
the military is used for &quot;world building&quot;, etc.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Conservatism, religious or otherwise, does not equal individual freedom.
</em><br>
<p>Conservatism does stress &quot;rugged individualism&quot; and the ability to 
<br>
let some members of our society fail in an evolutionary fashion. 
<br>
It's a start.
<br>
<p>Regards,
