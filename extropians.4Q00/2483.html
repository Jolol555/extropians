<p>Well, the easy answer is that we may put the finishing touches on a
<br>
Friendly seed AI which will set nanites to work for us.  But I'll do a
<br>
little more work, since I doubt that will satisfy you.
<br>
<p>I'll start with resources, because that's the easiest.  While there's
<br>
lots of great things here on Earth, things that, as far as we know, we
<br>
can't find or make anywhere else, raw energy is not one of them.
<br>
Neither is raw stuff.
<br>
<p>Now, in case you weren't aware of it, Earth's resources can't be saved
<br>
forever, or even anything like forever.  The Earth will be swallowed
<br>
up by our dying sun billions of years from now; some large rock will
<br>
almost certainly come flying at us out of the Oort cloud MUCH sooner
<br>
than that.
<br>
<p>If this happens at a technological stage in which we can evacuate the
<br>
earth, getting hit or swallowed up will, indeed, be a great loss.  But
<br>
we'll be losing lots of plant and animal life, millions of years of
<br>
evolution, diversity and mystery.  Resources would be the least of our
<br>
concerns; indeed, I argue that resources, as such, wouldn't be a
<br>
concern at all.  Stars, black holes, other weirder forms of energy,
<br>
all of these await civilization if it doesn't kill itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Where is this longevity going to come from, with our veins filled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with carcinogens and our bodies bombarded by radiation?
</em><br>
<p>As for longevity in the face of widespread carcinogens, the answer to
<br>
your question is medicine.  100 years of medicine, assuming we
<br>
survive, will almost certainly bring with it a heck of a lot of
<br>
development.  While the immortality that most of us seek is certainly
<br>
impossible barring something like the AI/nanotech one-two punch that
<br>
seems to dissatisfy you, there are easier ways to live longer.  Many
<br>
poisons have antidotes.  Many diseases have cures or vaccines.  There
<br>
will be many more antidotes, cures and vaccines developed over the
<br>
next 100 years (presuming, again, that we don't blow ourselves up in
<br>
the meantime).  These medicines will become increasingly affordable,
<br>
thanks to the wealth we expect from a century of economic growth.
<br>
Medicines are cheaper now in real terms than they were 100 years
<br>
ago.  This trend will continue, if we survive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Where is this happiness going to come from, with our spirituality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroyed by &quot;flatlander&quot; philosophers, our arts smashed by a media
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned only with profits, [...] 
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure I can never convince you that technological progress can make
<br>
us happier.  I will point out that we tend to be happier the wealthier
<br>
we are, but this tendency is weak.  Granted, crime tends to be lower,
<br>
and, more generally, rich civilizations tend to be freer (on anybody's
<br>
terms) than poor civilizations. * We also enjoy living longer, so long
<br>
as we don't run out of resources.  But happiness, while it can
<br>
correlate with these things, is not captured in any of the above.
<br>
<p>* [The noble savage is not a myth, but he's hardly the norm.  Spare me
<br>
your hamlet of paradise story; *most* hamlets are hellholes.]
<br>
<p>You mention &quot;flatlander&quot; philosophers, but flatland philosophy finds
<br>
more of a home in places and people focused on pragmatism for its own
<br>
sake (cf Soviet atheism) than in leisurely societies with time and
<br>
money to spare.  There's a reason that the postmodern notion of
<br>
&quot;discourse&quot; wasn't discovered until the late 20th century by
<br>
capitalists yearning for benevolent anarchy.  Indeed, I posit that
<br>
&quot;discourse,&quot; especially in the sense of &quot;free play&quot; will characterize
<br>
philosophy in the years to come, for this very reason.  We will still
<br>
be analytic, but will will understand our analysis in terms of a
<br>
discussion, rather than as a grand proof.
<br>
<p>As for our arts, there the correlation to wealthier and more leisurely
<br>
societies is far more obvious.  So, for those who WANT challenging and
<br>
engaging art, a high-technology society will be in the best way to get
<br>
it.  If you want high art, you look to where there's the MOST art,
<br>
namely rich time periods and cultures like the Renaissance, like the
<br>
musings of the idle priesthood in the East and in the West, like the
<br>
20th century (more than all of these put together).
<br>
<p>But, even if art is available to those who want it, perhaps our media
<br>
and our culture seems geared not to desire it.  You're right to be
<br>
worried about the increasing solidarity our culture is developing; we
<br>
should be more open to art (and entertainment generally) that isn't
<br>
the same thing we've always had.  But if anything will ameliorate THAT
<br>
problem, other than the proliferation of art itself, it is longevity.
<br>
You can't watch TV sitcoms and hope to watch the same old thing
<br>
forever.  Even the best prime time dramas capture too much of the old,
<br>
and not enough of the challengingly different.  But the older we get,
<br>
I assert, the duller that will be; or, if not, the more depth we will
<br>
find when we return to the classics.
<br>
<p>By the way, try to be open minded to those working for profit.  They
<br>
are, in fact, working for the masses.  They're the ones finding the
<br>
common bonds between their peers, sharing in their solidarity.  The
<br>
people prize them most of all.  That's why they keep paying.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; living in a world where we work from sunup until sundown with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope for another world hereafter?
</em><br>
<p>Leisure is easier when you're richer.  Breaks come more naturally when
<br>
you have time to spare.  The &quot;world&quot; of death looks less appealing
<br>
when the future has never looked so good, and you can be sure you'll
<br>
be there to see it.
<br>
<p>Assuming we make it, of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Rationalism is a dogma in of itself.
</em><br>
<p>If my *only* dogma is in being rational, then I think I'm doing pretty
<br>
well, frankly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, but they were working from an ascending paradigm.  Extropianism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gnosticism reversed, the exact same stand within a descending paradigm.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure the analogy makes sense.  Most extropians doubt the
<br>
existence of a spiritual world as such.  So, I GUESS you could say
<br>
that's a kind of villification of the spiritual world, but it's a
<br>
rather forced comparison, if you ask me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, this is where you are incorrect.  Gnosticism isn't just about posessing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the knowledge- it's about using it.  Extropianism is about knowledge as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well, and the gaining of a form of arcane knowledge- Artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, nanotech, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Well, as I said, I know hardly a thing about Gnosticism.  Will arcane
<br>
knowledge &quot;save&quot; us?  Sort of.  I'd say that if SOMEBODY has arcane
<br>
knowledge and uses it in the right way, then our chances of surviving
<br>
the destruction of the Earth look much better.  But I, personally,
<br>
don't need to know how an AI works or how to program a nanite to
<br>
receive that kind of &quot;salvation.&quot;  Rather, I need to be able to afford
<br>
the medicine of immorality, when it's developed.  I need to be
<br>
powerful; if knowledge gives me that power, well, great, but if I
<br>
manage to get there by investment banking, so be it.
<br>
<p>Again, the analogy seems forced.
