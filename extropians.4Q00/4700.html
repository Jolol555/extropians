<em>&gt;Since we were talking about GATTACA I thought I'd share the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lateral thinking puzzle I was ever told:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A man hates his job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One day he comes home and begins to drink...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He drinks till he passes out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He gets up in the middle of the night, and goes to the bathroom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then he turns out the light, and goes back to bed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When he wakes up in the morning, he looks out his window and see's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hundreds of people laying there dead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The man kills himself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Q. What did the man do for a living?
</em><br>
<p>I have not heard this one.  But, here are some guesses.
<br>
<p>He's a lighthouse operator and the &quot;light&quot; is the lighthouse.
<br>
<p>He's a cemetery caretaker and lives in the middle of the cemetery and 
<br>
there are always dead people lying around outside.
<br>
<p>He's a psychodelic drug chemist and the &quot;drink&quot; he prepares is a hallucinagin.
<br>
<p>He's a military grunt who lives in a missile silo.  It is his job to 
<br>
launch the counter attack after we have been attacked with nuclear 
<br>
war.  World War III starts, he launches the counter attack, drinks 
<br>
all night, and wakes up and thinks he is the last human left.
<br>
<p>He's a postman or some other disgruntled employee.  He killed all the 
<br>
people on the way home.  He drinks all night, looks out the window, 
<br>
realizes what he has done and kills himself.  (I.E., the story had 
<br>
nothing to do with the killings.)
<br>
<p>(The hard part is not getting the first possible explanation which 
<br>
the story was probably tailored for.  The hard part is inventing 
<br>
multiple explanations so that some are even beyond the expectations 
<br>
of the storyteller!)
