<p>Right, adultry has all the same related diseases as simple fornication, with
<br>
the addition of the risk of lead poisoning from a jealous spouse...  {8^D

<p>I doubt anyone would dispute that eating right, proper exercise and sleeping
<br>
in one's own bed really does result in longer life.  Our challenge is to figure
<br>
out how to produce the benefits without the profound sacrifices.
<br>
<p>Actually this came up at Extro4.  Talking with Dr. Roy Wolfford, the
<br>
biosphere doctor and CR promotor, I asked if the biosphere experiment
<br>
convinced doctors about the benefits of CR.  He gave me a surprising
<br>
answer: No, the life extending benefits of CR were not being
<br>
seriously questioned by gerontologists as late as 1993, these having
<br>
already been amply established.  His notion was that modern geriatrics
<br>
is about getting the *benefits* of CR without actually *doing* CR.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, anyway... it does seem a smart marketing ploy. Too bad it ruins the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Roger that, but take comfort in the knowledge that for every
<br>
innocent child ruined, religion inc produces the ruin of half a dozen
<br>
guilty children.  {8^D
