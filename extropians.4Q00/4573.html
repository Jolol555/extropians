An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Law: or,
<br>
Can Machines Be Made to Think Like Lawyers?
<br>
<p>Thank you for posting these URLs, Greg. I find this topic fascinating.
<br>
<p>J. C. Smith writes,
<br>
&lt;&lt;The theoretical issues which are swiftly developing in this new field of
<br>
artificial intelligence and law, will, in the final analysis, be about the
<br>
nature and structure of language and its many functions, and how humans
<br>
actually do reason.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>That's a good point. Roboticists can't begin to build a machine that thinks
<br>
like a lawyer until it is first discovered how humans actually reason.
<br>
Expert systems can augment the abilities of attorneys, but they're far from
<br>
replacing lawyers, right?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;No one as yet has transcended mind/body dualism, nor has bridged the
<br>
phenomenological gap between the two.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>How would we know if they did? It might not be evident to anyone but the
<br>
transcending individual, rather like a headache.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Legal theory, reflecting as it does the more broad ontological,
<br>
epistemological, and moral, disputes of general philosophy, is not
<br>
ideologically neutral. It is as much prescriptive as it is descriptive.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>That, I think, presents the greatest challenge for automating jurisprudence,
<br>
because AI *is* ideologically neutral, until it is programmed to conform to
<br>
the rules of a particular ideology. So, unless ideology is removed from
<br>
jurisprudence, machines can't be made to think like lawyers, unless the
<br>
ideology of each lawyer is specified for a corresponding machine. IOW, which
<br>
lawyer a machine is made to think like determines the ratio of prescriptive
<br>
to descriptive law involved.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;If mathematical/logical reasoning is best, and a logically deductive
<br>
system is ideal, then humans should reason more like computers. Artificial
<br>
intelligence would be the ideal model for real intelligence. If, on the
<br>
other hand, practical everyday reasoning is the optimum and paradigm form of
<br>
human cogitation, and deductive, mathematical, and logical reasoning is
<br>
something we only need to do, and should do on particular occasions for
<br>
particular purposes, then machines will become more intelligent as they
<br>
become better able to simulate human reasoning.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>So, we'll have to dumb down Robo-judges to make them more like humans. I
<br>
think it could be practical to make humans more rational instead.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
