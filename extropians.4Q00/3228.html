<p>4. ASTROPHYSICS: ON STARDUST
<br>
In astrophysics, the term &quot;dust&quot; refers to various entities: a)
<br>
interplanetary and cometary dust are found in the Solar System;
<br>
b) circumstellar dust is found around stars; c) interstellar dust
<br>
is found between stars. Individual dust particles are usually
<br>
called &quot;dust grains&quot; and range in size from approximately 10
<br>
nanometers up to the micron range (with an average size about the
<br>
size of particles in cigarette smoke). Interstellar dust
<br>
extinguishes and reddens starlight, can be detected by its
<br>
absorption and emission of infrared radiation, and can be
<br>
detected by its polarizing effect on starlight. The exact
<br>
composition of interstellar dust is uncertain, but infrared
<br>
absorption measurements indicate that a significant fraction of
<br>
the material is organic. In general, interstellar dust is
<br>
believed to be carbon, iron, and silicates mixed with or coated
<br>
with frozen water.
<br>
... ... J. Mayo Greenberg (University of Leiden, NL) presents a
<br>
review of recent research on interstellar dust and cometary dust,
<br>
the author making the following points:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The extinction curve for interstellar dust, which
<br>
indicates the reduction of light intensity at each wavelength,
<br>
indicates there must be 3 types of dust grains: a) The particles
<br>
that block light in the visible spectrum are elongated grains
<br>
nearly 0.2 microns in diameter and approximately 0.4 microns in
<br>
length. These particles account for approximately 80 percent of
<br>
interstellar dust, with each grain containing a rocky core
<br>
surrounded by a mantle of organic materials and ice. b) A hump in
<br>
the ultraviolet part of the extinction curve suggests the
<br>
presence of smaller particles of approximately 5 nanometers
<br>
diameter, which comprise approximately 10 percent of the total
<br>
dust mass. These grains are most likely amorphous carbonaceous
<br>
solids that probably contain some hydrogen but little or no
<br>
nitrogen or oxygen. c) Finally, an even smaller type of particle,
<br>
approximately 2 nanometers in diameter, is apparently responsible
<br>
for blocking light in the far ultraviolet region. These smallest
<br>
particles, which constitute the remaining 10 percent of the dust
<br>
mass, are believed to be large molecules similar to the
<br>
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emitted in automobile exhaust.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The author postulates a 100-million-year &quot;dust cycle&quot;,
<br>
which dust grains undergo approximately 50 times before their
<br>
destruction:
<br>
... ... a) In diffuse dust clouds, where gas is sparse, the dust
<br>
is a mixture of core-mantle grains, carbonaceous particles, and
<br>
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-like (PAH-like) molecules.
<br>
... ... b) When the dust enters a dense gas cloud, atoms and
<br>
molecules of gas adhere to the core-mantle grains and form an
<br>
outer mantle of ice. The carbonaceous particles and PAH-like
<br>
molecules also accrete on the core-mantle grains.
<br>
... ... c) Ultraviolet radiation affects the material in the ice
<br>
mantle, creating a layer of complex organic compounds of
<br>
yellowish color.
<br>
... ... d) As the cloud of dust and gas contracts to form a star,
<br>
some of the core-mantle dust grains clump together and become
<br>
comet nuclei. But the vast majority of the dust is dispersed.
<br>
... ... e) Returning to a diffuse cloud, the core-mantle grain is
<br>
exposed to harsher radiation that evaporates the ice mantle and
<br>
further processes the organic material. The complex of organic
<br>
compounds turns from yellowish to brown.
<br>
... ... f) Supernova shock fronts accelerate the dust grains,
<br>
causing violent collisions that shatter the organic mantles. The
<br>
debris becomes the carbonaceous particles and PAH-like molecules.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The author points out that as astronomers make new
<br>
discoveries about the chemical composition of both comets and
<br>
interstellar dust, they are becoming convinced that comets
<br>
originally formed as clumps of dust grains. In addition, comet
<br>
dust may have played a role in seeding life on Earth. Each loose
<br>
cluster of comet dust not only contains organic materials, but
<br>
also has a structure that is ideal for chemical evolution once it
<br>
is immersed in water. Experiments have indicated that small
<br>
molecules could easily penetrate such clumps from the outside,
<br>
while large molecules would remain sequestered in the interior.
<br>
The author states: &quot;Such a structure could stimulate the
<br>
production of ever larger and more complex molecules, possibly
<br>
serving as a tiny incubator for the first primitive life forms. A
<br>
single comet could have deposited up to 10^(25) of these 'seeds'
<br>
on the young Earth.&quot;

Related Background:
<br>
ON CARBON IN THE UNIVERSE
<br>
Carbon is a major factor in the evolutionary scheme of the
<br>
Universe because of its abundance and its ability to form complex
<br>
chemical entities. It is apparently also a key element in the
<br>
evolution of prebiotic molecules. The different forms of cosmic
<br>
carbon range from carbon atoms and carbon-bearing molecules to
<br>
complex solid-state carbonaceous structures, and evidence
<br>
gathered during the past decade has considerably enhanced our
<br>
understanding of the physical and chemical properties of carbon
<br>
materials in space. ... ...  Th. Henning and F. Salama (2
<br>
installations, DE US) present a detailed review of the subject,
<br>
the authors making the following points: 1) More than 75 percent
<br>
of the 118 *interstellar and circumstellar molecules identified
<br>
to date are carbon-bearing molecules, and one component of
<br>
interstellar dust is evidently carbonaceous. The cosmic evolution
<br>
of carbon from the interstellar medium into *protoplanetary disks
<br>
and *planetesimals, and finally into habitable bodies, is
<br>
intrinsic to the study of the origin of life. 2) Carbon plays an
<br>
important role in the physical evolution of the interstellar
<br>
medium because it is the main supplier of free electrons in
<br>
diffuse interstellar clouds, thus contributing to the heating of
<br>
interstellar gas. 3) The observation of unidentified ubiquitous
<br>
molecular and solid-state features in astronomical spectra, and
<br>
the realization that these features are linked to carbonaceous
<br>
materials, have resulted in major scientific progress in the past
<br>
decade. Laboratory and theoretical studies stimulated by these
<br>
astronomical observations have led to a better understanding of
<br>
the various forms of cosmic carbon such as polycyclic aromatic
<br>
hydrocarbons, carbon-chain molecules, carbon clusters, and
<br>
carbonaceous solids. These investigations have also led to the
<br>
detection of novel forms of carbon and laid the foundations for
<br>
the chemistry of *fullerenes. 4) The authors present the
<br>
following categorization of carbon in space:
<br>
... a) Carbon-rich circumstellar envelopes around *red giant and
<br>
*asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars: CO, C(sub2)H(sub2), complex
<br>
hydrocarbons, gas-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
<br>
... b) Diffuse interstellar medium: C+, simple diatomic
<br>
molecules, gas-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and carbon
<br>
chains.
<br>
... c) Dense interstellar medium: CO, complex hydrocarbons.
<br>
... d) Interstellar material in primitive meteorites: polycyclic
<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons.
<br>
5) The authors suggest that the widespread distribution of
<br>
complex organics in the interstellar medium has profound
<br>
implications for our understanding of a) the chemical complexity
<br>
of the interstellar medium, b) the evolution of prebiotic
<br>
molecules, c) the impact of this evolution on the origin and
<br>
evolution of life on early Earth through the exogenous delivery
<br>
(by cometary encounters and meteoritic bombardments) of prebiotic
<br>
organics.

Text Notes:
<br>
... ... *interstellar and circumstellar molecules: In this
<br>
context, an interstellar molecule is any molecule that occurs
<br>
naturally in clouds of gas and dust in space. In general, a
<br>
circumstellar molecule is any molecule that occurs in gas and
<br>
dust surrounding a star.
<br>
... ... *protoplanetary disks: These are dust disks surrounding
<br>
young stars; it is from these disks that planets presumably form.
<br>
... ... *planetesimals: Planetesimals are bodies with dimensions
<br>
of 10^(-3) to 10^(3) meters that are believed to form planets by
<br>
a process of accretion. The term &quot;accretion&quot; refers to an
<br>
aggregation, an increase in the mass of a body by the addition of
<br>
smaller bodies that collide and adhere to it, provided the
<br>
relative velocities are low enough for coalescence. As the mass
<br>
of the agglomerate increases, so does the rate of accretion, and
<br>
this accretion process is believed to generally occur in the form
<br>
of a disk. A stellar accretion disk is a swarm of dust grains
<br>
that evolve into planetesimals and then planets.
<br>
... ... *fullerenes: Fullerenes are large molecules composed
<br>
entirely of carbon, with the chemical formula C(sub n), where n
<br>
is any even number from 32 to over 100. They apparently have the
<br>
structure of a hollow spheroidal cage with a surface network of
<br>
carbon atoms connected in hexagonal and pentagonal rings.
<br>
... ... *red giant: A red giant star is a star in a late
<br>
stage of evolution. Having exhausted the hydrogen fuel in its
<br>
core, the star is burning elements heavier than hydrogen. It has
<br>
a surface temperature of less than 4700 degrees Kelvin and a
<br>
diameter 10 to 100 times that of the Sun.
<br>
... ... *asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars: These are stars
<br>
that occupy a strip in the *Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that is
<br>
almost parallel to and just above what is called the &quot;giant
<br>
branch&quot; off the *Main Sequence. Stars evolve from the horizontal
<br>
H-R branch to the asymptotic giant branch when they have
<br>
exhausted the helium in their cores and are instead burning
<br>
helium in a shell.
<br>
... ... *Hertzsprung-Russell diagram: The Hertzsprung-Russell
<br>
diagram is a plot of stellar absolute magnitude against spectral
<br>
type, and is perhaps the most useful diagrammatic aid in
<br>
astrophysics. It allows the portrayal of the evolution of a star
<br>
as occurring along various paths in the diagram.
<br>
... ... *Main Sequence: The Main Sequence is a region on the
<br>
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where most stars lie, including our
<br>
own Sun. The evolution of a star can be diagrammed as a movement
<br>
along the Main Sequence and an eventual branching off the Main
<br>
Sequence to regions associated with various types of old stars.

<p>The first issue of SCIENCE-WEEK appeared May 1, 1997, and it has
<br>
been published regularly each week since that date. SW is
<br>
designed to cross existing conceptual and linguistic barriers
<br>
between the scientific disciplines. In general, the biology is
<br>
written for physicists and chemists, and the physics and
<br>
chemistry are written for biologists, with an attempt to retain
<br>
some exactitude in the particular science involved in the news.
<br>
These are the aims. Undoubtedly, we are not always successful,
<br>
and for that we apologize. In any case, what we hope is that our
<br>
readers are reading out of their fields more than in their
<br>
fields, since that is the essence of this publication.
<br>
<p>We welcome comments, suggestions, and criticisms from our
<br>
subscribers. Public letters relevant to any report are also
<br>
welcome. Editorial contact: <a href="mailto:editors@scienceweek.com?Subject=Re:%20SCIENCE-WEEK%20December%201,%202000,%20ASTROPHYSICS:%20ON%20STARDUST&In-Reply-To=&lt;14890.34898.256177.438916@lrz.uni-muenchen.de&gt;">editors@scienceweek.com</a>
