</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, but it would not be necessary that we would have found ourselves&gt; originating from a solar system where two civilizations had evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; independently. That is the extra finding that would make all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; difference. If the evolution of intelligent life is very improbable then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would have been extremely unlikely that it would have happened on another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; planet in our own solar system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, you see, you're stuck measuring things on a plantary scale.  Couldn't we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead surmise that our -solar system- was particularly good at creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life-bearing conditions?
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, but this would also imply that other solar systems like our own would
<br>
likely be as particularly good at creating life bearing conditions.
<br>
<p>Now, Jeff Davis says:
<br>
<em>&gt; When I first read the article, I thought about it, and asked myself about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the strongest signal would be--the signal which would give the greatest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detectable range by which an affirmative conclusion might be drawn.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought perhaps the EM pulse from a naked nuclear explosion would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both the strongest, as well as the signal most undeniably indicative of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological civilization.  Clearly, such a signal would be brief.  But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assuming that to be the best signature by which others might detect OUR 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presence, I did a little research into the amount of such 'signaling' that we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have done.  It turns out that in the period between 1945 and 1998 humans 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have conducted 2,050 nuclear explosions, of which 528 have been atmospheric, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 1522 undergound.  If the EM pulse lasts for one tenth of a second (this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is just a guess, I leave it to others to help out with something more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authoritative), 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would mean 52.8 seconds of strong, unambiguous signal.  Fifty-three 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seconds in fifty years.  Using Arecibo's 10^14 watts as a basis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparison, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what might be the signal strength, and corresponding detection range for a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear explosion?  Perhaps the answer should be given as a range,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corresponding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the range of detonation yields? 
</em><br>
<p>However, excessive EMP signalling would not be an indicator of an intelligence
<br>
to communicate with, but either one to avoid or one that has exterminated
<br>
itself. Given 528 atmospheric explosions of nuclear weapons here on earth over
<br>
50 years, an alien race may conclude that we are a rather warlike and agressive
<br>
species that has little regard for its environment... not the sort of people you
<br>
would invite over for a visit...  If we had had a nuclear war, we could become a
<br>
target of interstellar colonization, since they would then know our world was
<br>
capable of sustaining intelligent life, and that we were likely in a very weak
<br>
position following such a war to oppose colonization attempts by another race.
<br>
Use of nuclear weapons is likely a good means of signaling to agressive alien
<br>
species &quot;Hey! Come conquer us!&quot; because use of such weapons dates the level of
<br>
advancement of our species very accurately.
<br>
<p>Because interstellar travel is so demanding energy wise (so far as we know) at
<br>
sub-light speeds, intelligent species likely cannot make an effective business
<br>
case for launching a mission to another planet in another star system unless it
<br>
can be shown that the planet can support intelligent life, and has a
<br>
technological infrastructure for the visiting species to hijack. Thus, they may
<br>
be out there, but they just listen for other races to off themselves with
<br>
nuclear wars...
