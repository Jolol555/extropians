<p>
Mike Lorrey said something which made me realize the irony
<br>
facing American voters in a few weeks.  Let me make a running
<br>
start at it:
<br>
<p>I have always resented the fact that the news media have so
<br>
much influence in major elections.  If they choose to dismiss
<br>
a candidate, that candidate has *no chance* of election.  In
<br>
both 92 and 96, I voted libertarian, but of course the news
<br>
media decided they did not want a libertarian, so... we got this
<br>
present yahoo and her husband.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, suppose we go ahead and accept things the way
<br>
they are, recognizing that the winner of this election will be
<br>
either the Democrat or the Republican.  I dont know the exact
<br>
numbers, but suppose that currently the likely voters are as follows:
<br>
<p>Republican:  45%
<br>
Democrat:  46%
<br>
Green:  2%
<br>
Libertarian:  2%
<br>
undecided:  5%
<br>
<p>If this is the case, then obviously this election is going to be a
<br>
cliffhanger, and the outcome is important as all hell, so then
<br>
suppose further that:
<br>
<p>1)  You decide you will donate 500 bucks to some political
<br>
party and 20 hours of your time campaigning for them.
<br>
<p>2)  That you are a Libertarian
<br>
<p>What is the most logical thing to do?  Vote Republican, your
<br>
*second* choice, and donate your money and time to...
<br>
the GREEN PARTY!  Your last choice!  The Eco-nazis!
<br>
<p>Reasoning:  since the news media is covering everything
<br>
said and done by the Rs and Ds, your paltry 500 bucks
<br>
and 20 hours would sway perhaps 10 votes.  However,
<br>
if you donate and campaign to one of the &quot;miscellaneous&quot;
<br>
parties, you will sway perhaps 100 votes with the same
<br>
donation and effort.  The 100 votes you win for the eco-
<br>
nazis would be mostly at the expense of your third choice
<br>
Dems, whereas if you donated and campaigned for the
<br>
Libertarians, the 100 votes you would sway would come
<br>
at the expense of your second choice Republicans!
<br>
<p>So, Mike, you are absolutely right, dammit.  {8-[  The logical
<br>
thing for a pragmatic Green to do is to vote Democrat and campaign
<br>
for and donate to Browne, while the most logical thing for a pragmatic
<br>
Libertarian to do is to vote Republican and donate to Darth
<br>
Nader.  Libertarians for eco-totalitarianism.  Greens for Browne.
<br>
Ill be damned.
<br>
<p>What am I missing?  spike
