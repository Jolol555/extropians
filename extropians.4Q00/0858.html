</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;assault weapons, I'll quote you a few facts and figures on them from your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;archnemesis, HCI:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.handguncontrol.org/facts/ib/assault.asp">http://www.handguncontrol.org/facts/ib/assault.asp</a>
</em><br>
<p>There is no defensive use of anthrax that I know of. It's easier to get 
<br>
dynamite today then to buy a gun. Nukes are for the super-rich - the upkeep 
<br>
is horrible, and you need lead lined shorts if you pack one on your hip.
<br>
<p>The 1934 National Firearms Act was a TAX LAW, meant to use as a club over 
<br>
the heads of organized crime. Compliance with this law was around 1% in the 
<br>
years after it's passing. In 1968, the govt. allowed an amnesty where 
<br>
individuals could register NFA weapons without paying the tax. Many of 
<br>
today's machine guns and artillery pieces in civilian hands came into the 
<br>
system in '68.
<br>
<p>For years before this was passed, individuals could purchase Thompson 
<br>
machine guns in the local hardware store at a reasonable price. Aside from 
<br>
a few (very few!) highly publicized gang shootings, there was no return to 
<br>
the Wild West caused by thousands of fully automatic guns being sold to 
<br>
anyone, including children, who could pay for them. The NFA also made 
<br>
silencers a taxed item - this has probably caused more hearing injuries to 
<br>
shooters and bystanders by a few orders of magnitude than it ever prevented 
<br>
criminal acts. In Europe, some shooting ranges REQUIRE silencers on rifles 
<br>
- just like on automobiles. It's a common sense safety precaution when you 
<br>
actually stop and think about it.
<br>
<p>The term &quot;assault weapon&quot; was coined by the HCI types. It has no legal 
<br>
definition, and no military rifle is ever called an &quot;assault weapon&quot; by the 
<br>
military. Any weapon - gun, knife, or club - can be an &quot;assault weapon&quot; if 
<br>
it is used in an attack.
<br>
<p>When you get right down to the nitty-gritty, an &quot;assault weapon&quot; is purpose 
<br>
designed to WOUND, not kill, in battle, as wounded enemy take up much more 
<br>
of the enemy's resources than dead. These easily carried guns are also 
<br>
ideal for home defense, and, seeing as the militia is the people, armed 
<br>
with state of the art MILITARY small arms, it is quite proper to expect 
<br>
people to buy them and keep them.
<br>
<p>We keep forgetting here that the fundamental law, the Second Amendment, 
<br>
refers to a people's militia, not the National Guard. And to be effective, 
<br>
the militia needs the same quality guns that the current army has. Under 
<br>
the Constitution, therefore, it might be OK to ban shotguns and rifles used 
<br>
only for hunting, but not sawed-off &quot;trench sweepers&quot; or machine guns used 
<br>
in battle. Hunting is not protected by the Second Amendment. These kinds of 
<br>
guns definitely are, regardless of passed laws and the opinions of HCI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In 1994, a leading law enforcement executive characterized semi-automatic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assault weapons as nothing more than &quot;cop-killer guns,&quot; and at that time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assault weapons accounted for more than 17% of fatal shootings of police.)
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Cop-killer&quot; has been used a number of times. It is meaningless. There were 
<br>
bans of &quot;cop killer&quot; bullets - ammo that was ONLY sold to police 
<br>
departments. These terms are coined to further demonize the product that it 
<br>
is proposed be banned. More emotion grabbing meaningless words.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Assault weapon bans work. In 1989, when President Bush stopped the import 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of certain assault rifles, the number of imported assault rifles traced to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crime dropped by 45 percent in one year.  After the 1994 ban, there were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;18% fewer assault weapons traced to crime in the first eight months of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1995 than were traced in the same period in 1994, and the wholesale price 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of &quot;grandfathered&quot; assault rifles nearly tripled in the first post-ban 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;year.  Assault weapons are not just &quot;ugly guns.&quot; Semi-automatic hunting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rifles are designed to be fired from the shoulder and depend on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accurate shooting of one bullet at a time. Semi-automatic assault weapons 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are designed to be spray-fired from the hip and are designed to maximize 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;death and injury from a very rapid rate of fire. Assault weapons are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;designed with military features such as silencers, folding stocks, flash 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suppressors, barrel shrouds and bayonets which are ludicrously unsuited 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for civilian use.
</em><br>
<p>No military weapon except some sniper rifles comes with a silencer, nor are 
<br>
they issued with guns. The other &quot;hallmarks&quot; of &quot;assault weapons&quot; are all 
<br>
the &quot;scary&quot; looking parts. There is no difference in lethality between a 
<br>
&quot;sporting&quot; gun and a military gun - the military gun just looks &quot;meaner&quot; 
<br>
and more businesslike, while the &quot;sporter&quot; can be beautifully finished and 
<br>
engraved. Both will kill you dead.
<br>
<p>Folding stocks can be fired from the shoulder - that's why they are there. 
<br>
Fixed stocks without pistol grips can be fired from the waist, with a loss 
<br>
of accuracy. For covering fire, this is acceptable. Of course a hunter is 
<br>
interested in accurate shooting - he does not want to waste ammo and scare 
<br>
dinner away. The soldier in battle also wants to be frugal with ammo, if 
<br>
possible. An inaccurate gun would kill the soldier using it by preventing 
<br>
him from efficiently attacking the enemy. So to state that &quot;assault 
<br>
weapons&quot; cannot be used for hunting is silly, and wrong. Somebody tell me 
<br>
when the last time a civilian in the USA was injured by a BAYONET for 
<br>
christsake! (Although a bayonet makes a dandy shiskebob skewer...)
<br>
<p>I have a &quot;sporter&quot; AK-47 that hits 3&quot; groups without a scope at 100 yards, 
<br>
if fired from a bench. My original Romanian Army SKS is even more accurate. 
<br>
I find it wonderful how HCI can continue to ought right lie and group 
<br>
machine pistols like the Uzi with true rifles like the AK and SKS.
<br>
<p>Stupid laws like the &quot;assault weapon&quot; ban are just incremental gun 
<br>
prohibition - especially if the definition of &quot;assault weapon&quot; continues to 
<br>
mutate, like in California. It's not much of a stretch to include all 
<br>
weapons with barrels shorter than 16&quot; as &quot;assault weapons&quot; - then ALL 
<br>
handguns are gone, and with them the possibility that women, invalids, and 
<br>
handicapped persons just might be able to defend themselves against predation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Burglary is a crime, but that doesn't mean that everyone should leave 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their doors unlocked because everyone is proactively presumed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;innocent.  People both knowingly and unknowingly commit crimes.  Closing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the gun show background check loophole would make it harder for them to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so, and thus harder for kids, psychos and violent criminals to obtain the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quick and easy means to commit long-range mass murder, while not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interfering in the slightest with the rights of sane and law-abiding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adults to purchase, keep and bear.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;You can never make it impossible for kids, psychos and violent criminals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to illegally obtain firearms, but that is no reason not to make it harder 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for them to do so, if it does not interfere with the ability of sane and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;law-abiding adulyts to purchase, keep and bear.
</em><br>
<p>As long as any background check does not prevent a cleared individual from 
<br>
taking his purchase home with them at the time of the sale, I agree. But 
<br>
there must be NO listing of the gun itself - registration of the gun is a 
<br>
precursor to confiscation, as California has amply demonstrated. Waiting 
<br>
periods kill innocents who need protection NOW, and don't deter those with 
<br>
grudges - they can wait a day or three if they are really intent on mayhem.
