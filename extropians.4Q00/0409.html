Greg Burch has forwarded,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Attitudes to protect you against the one-sided information onslaught:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;1.  Since most of what we are told about new technology comes from its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;proponents, be deeply skeptical of all claims.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, that's really a good attitude to protect you from polio, one of the things
<br>
that technology (and one man's heroic genius) helped to eradicate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;2.  Assume all technology &quot;guilty until proven innocent.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Right, especially the technology that allows this message to be disseminated on
<br>
the Net.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;3.  Eschew the idea that technology is neutral or &quot;value free.&quot; Every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;technology has inherent and identifiable social, political, and environmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;consequences.
</em><br>
<p>As does every anti-technology political position.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;4.  The fact that technology has a natural flash and appeal is meaningless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Negative attributes are slow to emerge.
</em><br>
<p>In contrast, knee-jerk reactions based on out-dated political rhetoric are quick
<br>
to emerge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;5.  Never judge a technology by the way it benefits you personally. Seek a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;holistic view of its impacts. The operative question is not whether it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;benefits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you, but who benefits most? And to what end?
</em><br>
<p>Oh yeah, it's much more important to consider who benefits. Not! Just wait until
<br>
anti-technologist Jerry Mander needs some high-tech solution to emergent medical
<br>
problems. Then he'll use technology to continue waging his vendetta against
<br>
technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;6.  Keep in mind that an individual technology is only one piece of a larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;web of technologies, &quot;megatechnology.&quot; The operative question here is how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;individual technology fits the larger one.
</em><br>
<p>The operative question here is how anyone can take such a ludicrous statement
<br>
seriously. We're not supposed to be against technology per se, but rather
<br>
&quot;megatech.&quot; Likewise, I don't oppose anti-technologists... I just oppose
<br>
mega-anti-technologists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;7.  Make distinctions between technologies that primarily serve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;individual or the small community (e.g., solar energy) and those that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;operate on a scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;outside of community control (e.g., nuclear energy). The latter kind is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;problem of the day.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like an argument against the nationalization of technology. I'll drink to
<br>
that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;8.  When it is argued that the benefits of the technological lifeway are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;worthwhile despite harmful outcomes, recall that Lewis Mumford referred to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;alleged benefits as &quot;bribery.&quot; Cite the figures about crime, suicide,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;alienation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;drug abuse, as well as environmental and cultural degredation.
</em><br>
<p>The obvious inherent dishonesty of this statement makes rebuttal unnecessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;9.  Do not accept the homily that &quot;once the genie is out of the bottle you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cannot put it back,&quot; or that rejecting a technology is impossible. Such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;attitudes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;induce passivity and confirm victimization.
</em><br>
<p>How does an unbottled genie confirm victimization? Apparently Jerry feels
<br>
victimized by developments that can help people more than he can brainwash them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;10. In thinking about technology within the present climate of technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;worship, emphasize the negative. This brings balance. Negativity is positive.
</em><br>
<p>Would you like a bandage for your foot that you just shot, Jerry?
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>&quot;History is the most dangerous of all the products of the chemical laboratory of
<br>
our mind. It stimulates dreaming, it intoxicates nations, it generates in them
<br>
false memories, exaggerates their reflexes, irritates their old wounds, deprives
<br>
them of peace and infects them with megalomania or mania of persecution.&quot; Paul
<br>
