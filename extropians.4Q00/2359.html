<em>&gt; &gt; I have nothing to fear legally from cops, so any action they take against me is&gt; by definition illegal action, and I am legally able (and justified) to defend

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And what of those, typically poor and/or with non-easily-mobile assets

</em><br>
<p>A community is not an asset that belongs to you, and if its tyrannical, it must
<br>
not be worth much, or else you must enjoy tyrannical communities. Make up your
<br>
mind. I personally find that more poor people move around far more frequently
<br>
than more affluent people, so your argument does not hold. Welfare people seem
<br>
to find it quite easy to move from city to city and state to state to follow the
<br>
best benefits, according to the data. U-HAUL and KOA are wonderful things. I
<br>
could move my own household for $500-$1000 from coast to coast with little
<br>
trouble. People seem to excel at finding reasons to not do things far more than
<br>
finding reasons to do things.
