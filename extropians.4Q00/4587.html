<p><em>&gt; What we might want to discuss is this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  1)  Is secession or the threat thereof a good safety valve against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  centralized power?
</em><br>
<p>In a general sense it seems to obviously be so.  Unfortunately, secessionist 
<br>
sentiments often lead to political movements that end up in violence.  This 
<br>
seems to derive from the primitive desire of social groups to dominate each 
<br>
other and the &quot;totalist&quot; nature of the modern nation-state.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  2)  Where would it fit in Extropian or transhumanist politics?
</em><br>
<p>Studying historical and contemporary secessionist movements is definitely 
<br>
something that extropians should find extremely interesting, especially 
<br>
contrasting those that succeed without violence and oppression and those that 
<br>
don't.  Why was Czechoslovakia able to split up without violence?  What are 
<br>
the dynamics of the &quot;devolution&quot; movement in the UK?  Why are the people in 
<br>
the Balkans not able to peacefully define a civic order?  What dynamics led 
<br>
to the US Civil War, one of the bloodiest secessionist incidents of all time? 
<br>
&nbsp;These are all vital questions to people who want to create peaceful, 
<br>
intentional communities, especially when they anticipate a growth in 
<br>
difference among people in terms of power and character.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  3)  Is it ultimately more Extropian?  (I tend to think it is, though I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  see how some might disagree.)
</em><br>
<p>The tension is between the extropian valuation of complexity and diversity on 
<br>
the one hand and order and rationality on the other.  Obviously extropians, 
<br>
being solidly within the Enlightenment tradition, place a high value on a 
<br>
peaceful, lawful civil society.  Ideally, the tension between the relevant 
<br>
extropian values should be resolved in a way that makes the notion of 
<br>
&quot;secession&quot; irrelevant, since we would ultimately want a society that is so 
<br>
&quot;intentional&quot; that the notion of a totalist nation-state from which someone 
<br>
would WANT to secede would be obsolete.  However, until such an ideal state 
<br>
might be achieved, I think we probably have to make a mental reservation in 
<br>
favor of the &quot;right&quot; of individuals and groups to choose to remove themselves 
<br>
from the regime in which they find themselves.  In some instances, this could 
<br>
certainly mean &quot;secession&quot; in the sense it is usually understood.
