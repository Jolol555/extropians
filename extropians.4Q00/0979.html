thanks.

<em>&gt; You're a bit out of touch with Mom Logic, aren't you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that's not the real reason - keeping &quot;atheism&quot; out of the subject lines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be a major and unusual inconvenience and it really would border on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Family Correctness, like trying to keep message bodies clean.  Keeping the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject lines PG-13 is just ordinary netiquette, if you ask me.
</em><br>
<p>If you are suggesting that removing &quot;Gay&quot; or the word &quot;Sex&quot; is ordinary
<br>
netiquette then I think you are from another planet.  I will not comply.
