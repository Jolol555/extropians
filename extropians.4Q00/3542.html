<p><em>    &gt; if I delete my mp3 of my favorite Metallica song, I'm fairly certain your

<em>    &gt; collection will remain unscathed.
</em><br>
<p>And if I make a copy and send it to you then your collection will be unscathed too
<br>
because you'll get the exact same mp3 file back, it is digital after all.
<br>
<p><em>        &gt;&gt;If you have a better definition of death than having a last thought I'd  love to hear it.
</em><br>
<p><em>    &gt;Death = Permanent termination of the experience of reality.
</em><br>
<p>That's exactly equivalent to my definition, except that in my humble opinion my wording is
<br>
much better, it doesn't need  a murky concept like &quot;reality&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Perhaps you can envision modalities into which we might evolve
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; where the concept of &quot;having a thought&quot; is irrelevant to our existence.
</em><br>
<p>Like being brain dead. I am using &quot;thought&quot; in the broad sense that includes feeling.
<br>
<p><em>         &gt;&gt;Me:
</em><br>
<em>         &gt;&gt;what's &quot;the original&quot;?
</em><br>
<p><em>    &gt;The one with which we started.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, so &quot;The Original&quot; is a one celled zygote.
<br>
<p><em>      &gt;How long is that instant?
</em><br>
<p>Depends of how long &quot;now&quot; is, probably second or two for most people.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;Is there an actual effective reality in which  they are all &quot;me?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Depends of which &quot;me&quot; your talking about, the &quot;me&quot; of a year ago, the &quot;me&quot;
<br>
at the instant the copy was made, or the &quot;me&quot; of after the copy.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; In what -scientific- fashion is one of the brains simultaneously doing what
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; you describe above, and what possible substance does it have?
</em><br>
<p>Huh?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; By what science does my subjective experience mysteriously jump across to
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the clone?
</em><br>
<p>Something can't &quot;jump&quot; unless it occupies space (Where is the number eleven?)
<br>
and it's debatable if consciousness even has a position in space, when you're thinking about
<br>
something abstract I don't suppose it has anything to do with space, but if it ever does it's the
<br>
place you're thinking about.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Why is it important that the copy was made within a single  nanosecond?
</em><br>
<p>Because I can have a thought in 60 seconds. If the copy was made a 60 seconds
<br>
ago and then I'm hit by a bus then I've had a last thought  and so the &quot;me&quot; after the
<br>
copy was made is dead, and I wouldn't like that at all. The &quot;me&quot; of before the copy
<br>
is doing just fine but that's another matter.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Let me get this straight:  is it your contention that my discrete experience
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; of reality will, at the instant of impact, jump across to the (just
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; activated) copy?
</em><br>
<p>A loaded question. If your experience is and always will be &quot;discreet&quot; then obviously
<br>
I can't make another, but I've yet to find a scrap of evidence indicating that is true.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; there's got to be *something* making that mystical jump across into
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the new substrate,
</em><br>
<p>Indeed there is but it's not mystical, it's information.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;As far as I'm concerned, -you're- the one who believes in a human  soul
</em><br>
<p>You're the one claming this huge difference between &quot;The Original&quot; and &quot;The Copy&quot;.
<br>
Something must cause the difference, what is it, what does one have that the other does not?
<br>
It can't be matter, science can tell no difference between one hydrogen atom and another, and
<br>
if you're right and it's not information either then it can only be something beyond the scientific
<br>
method, the soul.
<br>
<p>To tell the truth I do believe in a soul, sort of, because information is about as close as you can
<br>
get to the traditional concept of the soul and still and still be rational. Consider the similarities:
<br>
<p>1)The soul is non material and so is information.
<br>
<p>2)It's difficult to pin down a unique physical location for the soul, and the same is true for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information.
<br>
<p>3)The soul is the essential, must have, part of consciousness,  exactly the same situation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is true for information.
<br>
<p>4)The soul is immortal  and so, potentially, is information.
<br>
<p>However there are also important differences between the soul and information:
<br>
<p>1)A soul is unique but information can be duplicated.
<br>
<p>2)The soul is and will always remain unfathomable, but information is understandable,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in fact, information is the ONLY thing that is understandable.
<br>
<p>3) Information unambiguously exists, I don't think anyone would deny that, but if the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soul exists it will never be proven scientifically.
