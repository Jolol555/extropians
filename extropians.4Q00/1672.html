<p>
Hi All,
<br>
<p>I haven't posted on this list in a long time but some of the
<br>
people who have been around a long time will know me.
<br>
<p>I'm going to recommend that everyone on this list who is in
<br>
decent health go and get some serious firearms training.
<br>
Self-defense is one of about fifteen things that I think are
<br>
key to staying alive and doing well in the world.  I'm emphasizing
<br>
it now because there is a good introductory opportunity that
<br>
may not be around much longer.
<br>
<p>Go to www.FrontSight.com and check out their free one day
<br>
submachine gun class.  It is near Las Vegas and is completely
<br>
free (weapons and ammo are provided); all you have to do is
<br>
get there (the course is a major loss leader to drum up
<br>
publicity and students but you get real instruction).  The
<br>
last course offered is in early December.  Maybe some of you
<br>
want to go as a group, if so, let me know and we can set 
<br>
something up.
<br>
<p>No, I don't think submachine gun is the first and best weapon
<br>
for you to learn but this course is free and other courses are
<br>
$500 and up .  If you would rather take a handgun, rifle or 
<br>
shotgun class and don't mind spending a few dollars by all 
<br>
means go to one of those (If you know me or want to know me 
<br>
and want to get in cheaper, send me an e-mail).  The basic 
<br>
principles are similar for all of the weapons.
<br>
<p>That is enough information for people who understand the 
<br>
value of self-defense (which should be most Extropians).  I'm 
<br>
going to write a little more for people who have not figured 
<br>
out the value of firearms training yet.  I know most of you 
<br>
think knowing how to defend yourself is a good idea and are 
<br>
just procrastinating.  Firearms may not be the most important 
<br>
or urgent thing to do but this course is about the most useful 
<br>
thing I can think of to do in a single day.  Don't procrastinate, 
<br>
go, you will be glad you did.  The rest of this e-mail if for
<br>
people who are neither convinced nor close-minded.
<br>
<p>To me, knowing how to shoot is like wearing a seat belt or 
<br>
brushing your teeth.  In the world as it is now firearms are the 
<br>
quickest road to competent self-defense.  The sooner you know 
<br>
how to use them the sooner you are prepared for an unexpected 
<br>
attack.  I don't expect to need to defend myself.  I don't 
<br>
expect a corrupt government to bother me anytime soon.  I don't 
<br>
expect to be in a war zone.  However, if you look at history 
<br>
and the world you will realize that none of these things
<br>
are certain.  Self-defense is best complemented by having 
<br>
money and staying away from trouble but neither is a guarantee 
<br>
of safety.  Both together are synergistic.
<br>
<p>I think violence is less of a threat than aging but you cannot 
<br>
do much to stop aging in a weekend and you can improve your 
<br>
self-defense ability quickly.  It is also possible that violence 
<br>
will become a more common immediate threat than aging.  Looking 
<br>
around the world, sometimes it happens.  I do not understand the 
<br>
world well enough to know that this country will not be involved 
<br>
in a serious war.  I do not know that this country will stay
<br>
a relatively free and reasonable place to live.  I don't expect 
<br>
problems but until I can rule them out it is sensible to make 
<br>
some minimal preparations to deal with them.  Being able to go 
<br>
someplace else is my first option but knowing how to defend 
<br>
myself is another worthwhile skill.
<br>
<p>There may be times and places when it does not make sense to 
<br>
keep a gun around but there is no reason not to know how to use 
<br>
a gun.  If there is any reasonable chance that it will someday 
<br>
be important for you to use a gun or if there is any chance 
<br>
that you will someday be faced with someone using a gun it 
<br>
makes sense for you to learn how firearms are used.  Firearms 
<br>
training at a good school is safe relative to driving there 
<br>
and you will come away with an understanding of weapons that 
<br>
you would not otherwise have.
<br>
<p>Most of the time it is good to have a gun around.  Properly 
<br>
set up no one is going to use it against you and you can keep 
<br>
it in a way that you are not going to have problems with children 
<br>
or accidents.  The reality is that if you face someone armed with 
<br>
a gun and you do not have a gun, you will not have much of a 
<br>
chance unless you have a lot of martial arts training.  Firearms 
<br>
training will help a lot because you will know what an attacker 
<br>
can do with their weapon.  You will be able to tell if they know 
<br>
what they are doing or not.  You will know how many tenths of 
<br>
a second you have to react.  A violent assault is unlikely if 
<br>
you are doing well in the current society but so is a serious 
<br>
car accident.  Also, things may not always stay the same and 
<br>
it may not be so easy to get the training then.  (I also 
<br>
recommend driving schools and they take a similar amount of 
<br>
time for a similar amount of risk reduction).
<br>
<p>I also have bought into the idea that a well armed population 
<br>
is a check on government abuse.  A government which disarms 
<br>
its citizens has more power over its subjects and is less 
<br>
prepared to defend against external attacks.  Some people in 
<br>
power may not always use that power in ways that are best for 
<br>
those they rule.  They may be perfectly nice, or only a little 
<br>
annoying, but they might also suspend a lot of rights and 
<br>
freedoms, and I'd rather not leave it to chance.  I am willing 
<br>
to hear arguments on either side but for now I will go with 
<br>
the idea that the second amendment is a good idea and was put 
<br>
there for a reason.
<br>
<p>I also believe that when freedom loving people get together 
<br>
and do things like learning to use weapons safely, responsibly, 
<br>
and skillfully they cross fertilize ideas.  I think actually 
<br>
going out and learning to use firearms gives a feel for how 
<br>
important self defense is in a way that you will not get from 
<br>
a lot of reading and lip service.  I think that more awareness 
<br>
of firearms in more people may have an effect on the culture 
<br>
in this country.  Weapon skill and ownership is really in most 
<br>
people's interest and I think that will become clear if enough 
<br>
people take the time to learn how to use firearms well.
<br>
<p>I notice that I feel a little uncomfortable posting this because 
<br>
I don't want to be labeled as a gun nut.  There is something 
<br>
wrong if we are afraid to unabashedly speak out on behalf of 
<br>
self-preservation and the freedom to defend ourselves.  Even if 
<br>
there is not a lot to defend ourselves from, there is something 
<br>
wrong with people trying to disarm gentle people by force and 
<br>
law.  I have always believed in self-defense; I'm just doing 
<br>
something about it now.  I am taking a few courses.  It would be 
<br>
good if you did also.  Otherwise there will not be a lot you can 
<br>
do if someone else decides to use a gun against you.  Watch 
<br>
_Shoah_, go to a few murder trials, and then tell me why you 
<br>
will never need to use a gun or defend against one.
<br>
<p>Another consideration is that nanotech and AI may eliminate 
<br>
the relevance of firearms.  That may be true one of these days 
<br>
but we are not there now.  We may someday live in utopia but 
<br>
I think there is a good chance that even after nanotech and 
<br>
AI we will still have a need for self-defense (perhaps even 
<br>
more so).  Firearms may someday cease to be relevant but the 
<br>
combat mentality and concepts that you learn will still 
<br>
apply.  Assuming that you are the defender and not the 
<br>
aggressor you need to learn to see threats coming, respond 
<br>
quickly, and respond skillfully.  That will be true for many 
<br>
weapons for a long time to come.  You may as well develop 
<br>
the habits and mental discipline now.
<br>
<p>Finally, I have a hunch.  It's just an idea and it may not 
<br>
apply to everyone.  It's only something I feel and I'm not 
<br>
even sure it applies to me yet.  I think really knowing that
<br>
you can defend yourself is good for your energy level and 
<br>
peace of mind.  It may be a biological effect of vigorous 
<br>
and complex physical training.  It may be that our simian 
<br>
brains are more comforted by knowing that we can eliminate 
<br>
threats than by all of our reassurances about what a nice 
<br>
and safe neighborhood that we live in.  It may also be 
<br>
that our brains also still respond to a pecking order system 
<br>
which recognizes self-defense ability as a key dominance
<br>
trait.  Whatever, it may be comforting and good for your 
<br>
psyche to know that you can defend yourself even if you 
<br>
never need to.
<br>
<p>Firearms ownership and skill has always been a given in 
<br>
Extropian circles but it's time we did something about it.  
<br>
If you have not had training at one of the major firearms
<br>
institutes or put a lot of time and effort getting to a 
<br>
similar level some other way you are seriously behind the 
<br>
curve.  That can be fixed quickly and easily, and frankly
<br>
it's a lot of fun.  A good extropian sort ought to be 
<br>
able to take out most threats they can see in a few 
<br>
seconds or less and get on with their life. 
<br>
<p>Okay, that's it.  Reasoned arguments are welcomed as 
<br>
always.  Keep your eyes out for my life extension web 
<br>
site in a few months and I'll talk about a lot of the 
<br>
other things I think are important and why.  I'm only 
<br>
harping on this firearms thing because the opportunity 
<br>
may not be there much longer.
<br>
<p>So, go to www.FrontSight.com and sign up for the free 
<br>
submachine gun course or one of the other courses.  
<br>
Send me e-mail if you have any question.  I hope to 
<br>
see a lot of you there.
<br>
<p>Cheers all,
<br>
Will
