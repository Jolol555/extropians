<p><em>&gt;Isn't the notion of the &quot;media&quot; becoming obsolete in this day of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;user to user communications?  I don't think we can usefully
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distinguish between the media and ordinary people, when anyone can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;publish and share his observations via the Internet.
</em><br>
<p>The Internet is not primarily a broadcast media.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would not support banning discussion of elections by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuals.  In the first place such a limitation would be almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impossible to enforce. In the second place it sets a precedent for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;further erosion of freedom of speech, one of the most important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principles in guaranteeing freedom.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not talking about banning discussion of elections by
<br>
individuals, just the broadcast media, and only for the duration of
<br>
voting. Enforcing should be easy.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Ultimately the question is whether to try to limit the flow of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information. It's true that people's behavior may change if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know more about what is going on, including how people are voting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;during the course of election day.  But IMO we have to accept this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kind of change.
</em><br>
<p>It's trying to limit the negative effect of information during
<br>
voting hours only. Can you suggest a positive use for this flow?
<br>
During the voting hours only?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Giving people more information will make many changes in society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Many of them are good, some of them are potentially bad (at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for some groups).  We have to learn to live with a highly informed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society, rather than fighting this change.
</em><br>
<p>There a difference between information being used to inform, and
<br>
used to influence an outcome.
<br>
<p>The fact that broadcast media is biased is a problem.
