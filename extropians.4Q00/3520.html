<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Working in Vermont as I do, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the current Civil Union controversy raging, it has turned out that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the overt 'hate' crimes committed here since the 'Take Back Vermont'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; grassroots campaign began were actually committed by gays trying to gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; sympathy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>BULLSHIT.  That statement reeks of unsupported claim.  And I know my
<br>
people better than that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Please provide referrences proving your contention that all (overt?) hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; crimes commited in the state of Vermont in the period in question were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actually commited by gays.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those were the only two of consequence, that I already mentioned, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will research and see if there were others. The remainder were mostly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all phone calls to judges, clerks, and legislators. Many found that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of the hostile invective during this whole period was from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those supporting civil unions, making many rather hateful remarks about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those opposed to civil unions on principle but who were not anti-gay in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You ducked the question Michael.  Put up or withdraw this preposterous
<br>
claim. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Most of the invective in the other direction has been, I have found,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anger that is a consequence of the individuals it is directed at being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; royal jerks no matter what their persuasion is. If thats a crime, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call me a bigot. I hate assholes too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You seem to have a love of empty generalizations.  Can't you make your
<br>
points without them?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is funny, actually. Most of those same communities experience no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murders, car thefts, robberies, or other major crimes, yet does the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; federal government claim they are also lying about that too? If so,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where are the bodies??? Insurance claims? These communities typically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have one or two part time policemen, and some go decades without any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of death under questionable circumstances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As hard as it may seem for some people to believe, there are, in fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many communities of peaceful, broad minded, tolerant people in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country who are pushing no agenda, and want nothing more than to be left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in peace. There will always be individuals who are bigoted, but guess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what? Its their RIGHT. So far as I know, thought is not yet a crime in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this country, and its not your right to claim to be violated just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because not everybody thinks you are super.
</em><br>
<p>I could really give a shit what someone thinks of me.  But when they
<br>
deny me the same rights as others have because of their bigoted opinion
<br>
or attack me and mine then that is a different matter entirely.  Don't
<br>
trivialize this.  Having people you know killed just for being different
<br>
(one publicly beat to death with baseball bats) tends to make you pissed
<br>
off as hell when someone claims that you're just upset because people
<br>
don't think you and &quot;your kind&quot; are super.
