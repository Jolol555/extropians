<em>&gt;&gt;For those of you who read Ian Arcatling's first message, it is only fair to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;inform you that it was apparently sparked by my recent mailing of Member
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Updates and Renewal Requests, which many of you have already received.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     No, it wasn't.  I was not kidding when I wrote that I have never 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;received anything.  I haven't.  That means that I haven't received whatever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is you are talking about in your posting.  All I have received is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;confirmation that I am (or was) a member.  That was some time in the fall 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last year, October, November, something like that.  After that, nothing.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Even if you do mail things to members you have never mailed anything to me.
</em><br>
<p>It looks like we still have an old e-mail address, namely:
<br>
Ian.Arcatling.3445@student.uu.se.  This is likely the reason you
<br>
haven't been getting any mailings.  I'll make this revision to the
<br>
database presently.
