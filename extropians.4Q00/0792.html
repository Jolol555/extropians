</em><br>
<p>Well, we seem to have another death penalty discussion at hand.
<br>
This appears to generate lots of opinions, but little reasoning
<br>
from first principles.  When we administer criminal punishment,
<br>
what are we trying to accomplish in the first place?  Several things
<br>
come to mind:
<br>
<p>- Revenge.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it difficult to come to grips with this rationally.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, we have a strong desire to do unto others as they do
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto us, especially if they harmed us.  This looks like an evolved
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;survival trait, but I'm uncertain how to justify it in a rational
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manner.  The death penalty fulfills the revenge urge very well.
<br>
<p>- Reform.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what they told us in religion/ethics class back in school.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposedly reforming the criminal to make them a better citizen
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the primary purpose of punishment.  In practice, it doesn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look like this to me.  Capital punishment does nothing for this,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of course.
<br>
<p>- Removal.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also applies to prison and deportation.  The goal is to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove criminals from society in order to keep them from doing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any further harm.  Clearly, the death penalty is a supremely
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effective means to get rid of a problem person.
<br>
<p>- Restitution.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have the criminal repay the damage they did.  Basically, this is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only applicable to property damage, and in practice usually only
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to minor ones.  Putting a price tag on a human life is difficult,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but killing yet another person doesn't provide any economic gain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in itself.
<br>
<p>- Deterrence.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm under the impression that US experience tells that the death
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;penalty does little to deter criminals, although I'm uncertain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about the psychology involved.  If you build a system based on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deterrence, you have to carefully grade punishment.  Once people
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are subject to the maximum penalty if caught, they have nothing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to lose, and that's one of the least things you want.  (&quot;Hey, I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;already killed a cop.  Five more won't change anything.&quot;  Bad.)
