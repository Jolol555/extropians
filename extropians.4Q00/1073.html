<br>
<p><em>&gt; In short, the possibility I outlined at the start of this thread is but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a major exaggeration of the world I personally face today.  I do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take this as proof that the Singularity has already started, but it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tempting to do so.  Main fact weighing in favor: the Singularity is, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand it correctly, the point where no one can make reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictions about the future.  Already, most of my friends have given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up trying to predict their personal lives, or what tech will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available, even one or two years ahead.
</em><br>
<p>Which is really giving up their own rationality. Of course, the future
<br>
is highly unpredictable but that doesn't mean one shouldn't plan for
<br>
it - this is where rationality becomes indispensable.  A society that
<br>
doesn't do this will run into nasty surprises quite often. 
<br>
<p>I wouldn't say a Singularity makes everything unknowable, rather that
<br>
it makes things unknwoable for people standing too far away from
<br>
it. It will be an always receeding horizon, but close to it time
<br>
distances will be very short.
<br>
<p>I found Brand's _The Clock of the Lond Now_ quite nice reading on
<br>
this, a kind of slow counterpoint to the transhumanist crescendo
<br>
ideas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; What might happen is of course that the posthumans (or people of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; new economy or whatever) want to make sure people staying behind do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this due to their own values as a rational decision, rather than just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; due to mistaken information, habit or something else. Hence they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want to give an unbiased image of what they are missing out on (here I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will just assume ethical posthumans; posthumans with an ideological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; axe to grind is another matter of course). Education becomes very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relevant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But, unless one can comprehend the way forward, how can one not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistaken information about it?  And if those who choose not to advance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do (or seem to) universally not truly comprehend the way forward, how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can one disprove that it is the lack of comprehension itself which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causes people to stay behind?
</em><br>
<p>There are many levels of ignorance, and some are harder to deal with
<br>
than others. Some are just due to mistaken facts. Others are because
<br>
you have not had the chance to interact and ask questions. Deeper
<br>
forms depend on preconceptions filtering all information into certain
<br>
patterns, and the trickiest kinds depend on values selecting which
<br>
information channels to view and what to even accept. Where education
<br>
ends and coercion begins is a hard question - but not a question we
<br>
must shrink back from.
