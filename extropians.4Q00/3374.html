<em>&gt; &gt; The possibility of a &quot;christian moral revolution&quot; in the US is very real.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Fundamentalists are 30-40% of the population, growing, a majority in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some areas, and could reasonably take control of the national
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government, as they largely control the Republicans.  It's happened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; twice before in the US.  A &quot;hindu moral revolution&quot; has basically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; taken over India recently.  A libertarian moral revolution is IMO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; also quite possible but it's far from realization, unlike these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; religious ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This same phenomenon is occuring in Israel, as the fundamentalist Jewish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population is growing at a rate outstripping that of the more liberal, urban
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jews at a rate of almost 6:1.
</em><br>
<p>Such movements don't tend to maintain coherence beyond one or two
<br>
generations unless they remain highly isolated. Now, it seems the fundie
<br>
jews are probably feeling the pressure from the even higher reproductive
<br>
rates of the arab israelis and palestinians, who express even more
<br>
extreme fundamentalist rhetoric.
<br>
<p>The problem with the scenario in the US is the assumption that the
<br>
'christian morals' are consistent across all 'christian' groups. They
<br>
are not, and I doubt very much the statistics claiming that fundies make
<br>
up 30-40% of our population. Relying on polls to determine an
<br>
individual's status as a 'fundie' or not is really poor statistical
<br>
practice. There is a significant difference between a fundamentalist and
<br>
your average ignorant fool. One is dangerous by intent, the other by
<br>
neglect.
<br>
Nor is relying on sect membership a good indicator of the 'fundie'
<br>
population. Another thing to consider is that the definition of what is
<br>
a 'fundamentalist' tends to be declared by the major media, who are not
<br>
disinterested non-partisan moderates in this respect. To a man (and
<br>
woman), members of the mainstream media, while seeming to accept without
<br>
question the media's influence on public opinion, politics, and the
<br>
progress of elections as a divine right, vehemently decry's the right of
<br>
religious or conservative organizations to have anything approaching a
<br>
fraction of the same level of influence on our governmental and
<br>
political process.
<br>
<p>They also play the LP like a top, using the 'legalize pot' gambit
<br>
perennially to demonstrate to voters that third parties are by and large
<br>
loonybins, and that they should put their faith in the democratic party.
