Hello all, this is my first time posting here so be gentle! I am going to 
<br>
take C.J.'s lead and introduce myself also. My name is Brian Shores, and I 
<br>
have been a huge fan of sci-fi ever since I can remember. I have always been 
<br>
interested in future possibilities, and have molded my belief system on the 
<br>
premise that anything is possible given the right amount of time and effort. 
<br>
I am a mechanical design engineer by trade, but I have a wide variety of 
<br>
interests, such as computers and VR, music, art, and philosophy/sociology. I 
<br>
came upon the extropy.org website and could not believe what I was reading. 
<br>
It was like Max had summarized the majority of the ideas that I was thinking 
<br>
all along in a concise, logical order! I was hooked and decided to jump on 
<br>
for the ride myself. I just KNEW that I wasn't alone in my thinking! Glad to 
<br>
be a part of all this.
<br>
<p>And now a few comments on some of the current discussions:
<br>
<p>As far as I am concerned, I do not mind if a group of intelligent people have 
<br>
my full contact information... hopefully I will be able to contribute 
<br>
something useful to the discussion once I get into the flow of things. The 
<br>
problem is that there are just a large number of people out there (and 
<br>
corporations such as Doubleclick) that use personal information to their 
<br>
advantage, and a small number of people who have malicious intent with such 
<br>
info. I look forward to the day where people can get beyond the greed, 
<br>
selfishness, and pettiness that our society seems to be stuck in right now 
<br>
and be able to join together and do something truly great with our species. I 
<br>
think that if people learned to trust one another (the belief that all human 
<br>
beings are basically good), and totally accept who we each are as 
<br>
individuals, it would not matter so much if we had a mutually (I agree with 
<br>
Zero that it MUST be mutual) transparent society. Freedom of information 
<br>
comes with the responsibility to use that information in a benevolent way.
<br>
<p>On having a pseudo-self online... It is a very iteresting thing to me to be 
<br>
able to have an alter-ego online (especially in virtual environments such as 
<br>
ActiveWorlds).  Digital-selves or avatars allow us to explore new social, 
<br>
artistic, and cultural relationships with people through the use of a 
<br>
computer interface and the web.
<br>
<p>Also, I will be one of the first in line for an in-line broadband connection 
<br>
straight into my brain, because I just don't have enough time in the day to 
<br>
absorb all of the ideas and knowledge that is out there for the taking! We 
<br>
can only wait for that day to happen for the common man!
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>Brian (A.K.A. Artillo)
