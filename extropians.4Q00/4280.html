&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANCESTORS: Matheis Heinlein arrived in Philadelphia on
<br>
October 31, 1754 and settled in Durham Township, Bucks County,
<br>
Pennsylvania, raising two daughters and son George Heinlein
<br>
(1742-1805), captain of Durham township militia throughout the
<br>
Revolutionary War. About 1860, Heinlein's triple great
<br>
grandfather and three others among George's grandsons and great-
<br>
grandsons moved to Ohio. Heinlein's paternal grandfather one of
<br>
early settlers of Missouri. anecdotes passed down in the
<br>
Heinlein Family Association [LS:8]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOTHER: Bam Lyle (Heinlein), daughter of Doctor Alva E. Lyle
<br>
(-1914, inspiration for &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; [LS:8-9]) a
<br>
country doctor settled in Butler, Missouri.

James MORGAN, ironmaster of Durham Furnace, was the father of
<br>
Daniel MORGAN, the famous general of the Revolution. James's second
<br>
wife was Sarah, daughter of Matheis Heinlein who arrived in
<br>
Philadelphia, on the Bannister, from Amsterdam in 1754.

<br>
<p>The ship Bannister was in Phaldelphia, Pennsylvania, 21 OCT 1754.
<br>
(From the book &quot;Pennsylvania German Pioneers&quot; by Ralph B. Strassburger and
<br>
&nbsp;William J. Hinke, published in 1934 by the Pennsylvania German Society, 
<br>
&nbsp;Norristown, PA.)
<br>
<p>The Palatines to America, a national genealogical society of persons
<br>
researching German-speaking ancestry, does not list a German Heinlein
<br>
arriving on the Bannister.
<br>
<p>I have seen statements in print media that &quot;Matheis Heinlein&quot; originally was
<br>
a &quot;Matheis Hämäläinen&quot; from Finland (which 1754 formed a part of Sweden).
<br>
[I can neither confirm nor deny this information at this time, however.]
