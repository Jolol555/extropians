<p>I see.  That explains the absense of bickering on the list, between &gt;H and
<br>
extropians, among libertarians, and between cryonics organizations.

<p>That much I agree with.  Many leaders of Labor and Likud still bitterly despise
<br>
each other for acts allegedly committed by the other during the British Mandate.
<br>
Rabin was assassinated by a fellow Jew who believed he was betraying them by
<br>
giving away land deeded to them by God.  Why, meetings of the Knesset are almost
<br>
as raucous as those of the House of Commons....
