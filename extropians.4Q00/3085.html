A few recent research abstracts from the LEF.org site. For your perusal.

<p>St Johns wort for depression 
<br>
Full source: ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE, 2000, Vol 160, Iss 2, pp
<br>
152-156 
<br>
Articles with data on the efficacy, safety, and availability of St Johns
<br>
wort were studied and randomized, controlled, double-blind trials were
<br>
selected and assessed for methodological quality using a standardized
<br>
checklist, and data on pharmacology, cost, regulation, and safety were
<br>
extracted. Eight studies were identified, found to be of generally good
<br>
methodological quality, and determined to provide a modest amount of data
<br>
to suggest that St Johns wort is more effective than placebo in the
<br>
treatment of mild to moderate depression. The response rate with the use
<br>
of St Johns wort ranged from 23% to 55% higher than with placebo, but
<br>
ranged from 6% to 18% lower compared with tricyclic antidepressants. More
<br>
data are required to assess both its use in severe depression and its
<br>
efficacy compared with other antidepressants. Rates of side effects were
<br>
low. As a potent and useful dietary supplement, St Johns wort is currently
<br>
largely unregulated. However, the FDA is reviewing plans to tighten its
<br>
regulation. 
<br>
<p>Kava extract for anxiety 
<br>
Full source: JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY, 2000, Vol 20, Iss 1,
<br>
pp 84-89 
<br>
Synthetic anti-anxiety drugs are effective for treating anxiety, but they
<br>
have many adverse effects. A review and analysis assessed the evidence for
<br>
or against the efficacy of kava extract as a symptomatic treatment for
<br>
anxiety. Systematic Literature searches were performed in the computerized
<br>
databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, AMED, CISCOM, and the Cochrane Library.
<br>
Experts on the subject were contacted to provide further information. The
<br>
results showed the superiority of kava extract over the placebo by all
<br>
seven reviewed trials. The analysis of three trials suggests a significant
<br>
difference (90%) in the reduction of the total score on the Hamilton
<br>
Rating Scale for Anxiety in favor of kava extract. The data imply that
<br>
kava extract is superior to placebo as a symptomatic treatment for
<br>
anxiety. Therefore, kava extract is an herbal treatment option for anxiety
<br>
that is worthy of consideration. 
<br>
Use of complementary health practices with prostate cancer 
<br>
Full source: CANCER, 2000, Vol 88, Iss 3, pp 615-619 
<br>
There has been increasing interest in complementary health practices among
<br>
individuals, popular media, and even institutional health care providers.
<br>
A study of 50 individuals undergoing radiation treatment for prostate
<br>
cancer found that a surprisingly high proportion (37%) relied on
<br>
complementary health practices not prescribed by physicians. In contrast,
<br>
according to a separate survey of the treating physicians, the physicians
<br>
believed that on average only 4% of their patients resorted to such
<br>
practices. The use of complementary health practices usually continued
<br>
even after the initiation of definitive treatment for prostate cancer.
<br>
Those who used complementary health practices tended to have higher levels
<br>
of education and income, whereas there were no differences in age,
<br>
religion, perception of health status, stage of prostate cancer, or
<br>
prostate specific antigen (PSA) level. Herbal remedies were the most
<br>
frequently utilized, by 60% of those using complementary health practices,
<br>
followed by old-lime remedies (47%), high dose vitamins (41%),
<br>
chiropractic/ massage therapy and relaxation techniques (18% each), and
<br>
special diets (12%). 
<br>
<p>Effect of Ginkgo/drug combination on pancreatic cancer 
<br>
Full source: Arzneimittel-Farschung-Drug Research, 1999, Val. 49, Is 12,
<br>
PP 1030-1034 
<br>
A study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability as well as the quality of
<br>
life under treatment with a drug, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), combined with
<br>
ginkgo biloba extract (GEE) in 32 individuals with locally or metastatic
<br>
advanced pancreatic cancer. The treatment was repeated every three weeks
<br>
until progression. Response to therapy was evaluated after 2 and 4
<br>
treatment courses. Progressive disease was observed in 22 ( 68.8 % )
<br>
individuals, no change in 7 (21.9 % ) and partial response in 3 (9.4 % ).
<br>
The overall response was 9.4 %. Adverse events were judged as related to
<br>
the drug 5-FU and consisted of liver toxicity. In comparison with the
<br>
results of the studies with the drug, gemcitabine, the combination of
<br>
5-FU/GEE shows comparable response rates. The toxicity of the 5-FU/GEE
<br>
combination was low. The results suggest a good benefit-risk ratio of the
<br>
combination of the drug 5-FU and GEE in the treatment of pancreatic
<br>
cancer.

Selenium inhibits angiogenesis in breast cancer 
<br>
Full source: Mol Carcinogen 99, Vol. 26, Iss. 4, Pgs. 213-225 
<br>
The trace element nutrient selenium (Se) has been shown to possess
<br>
cancer-preventive activity in both animals and humans. The process of
<br>
angiogenesis (development of new blood vessels) is necessary for the
<br>
genesis and growth of solid cancers. A study examined if selenium exerts
<br>
its cancer-preventive activity, by inhibiting cancer-associated
<br>
angiogenesis. Increased selenium intake as selenium-enriched garlic,
<br>
sodium selenite, or Se-methylselenocysteine led to a significant reduction
<br>
of tumor density in breast cancers during continuous exposure for 7 weeks.
<br>
<p>Also, there were significantly lower levels of vascular endothelial cell
<br>
growth factor activity in a sizeable proportion of the selenium-treated
<br>
cancers, compared to the control group. In contrast to the breast cancers,
<br>
the microvessel density of the mammary glands that were not involved, was
<br>
not altered by the selenium treatment. In cell culture, direct exposure of
<br>
human umbilical vein endothelial cells to selenium induced cell death
<br>
predominantly through apoptosis. The results indicate a potential for
<br>
selenium metabolites to inhibit key attributes (proliferation, survival,
<br>
and cell matrix degradation) of endothelial cells which are critical for
<br>
angiogenesis to begin. Therefore, inhibition of angiogenesis associated
<br>
with cancer may be a mechanism for the anticancer activity of selenium in
<br>
vivo. 
<br>
Ginkgo biloba extract and peripheral arterial occlusive disease 
<br>
Full source: Arzneim Forsch Drug Res 99, Vol. 49, Iss. 11, Pgs. 900-904 
<br>
Several clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of Ginkgo biloba
<br>
extract in the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. A study
<br>
that was conducted to confirm the superiority of the higher dosage of
<br>
Ginkgo biloba extract on 74 individuals indicated the superiority of 240
<br>
mg Ginkgo biloba extract daily compared with the standard dosage of 120 mg
<br>
to 160 mg daily. The primary efficacy criterion was the difference of the
<br>
pain-free walking distance between the start of treatment and after 24
<br>
weeks measured on a treadmill under standardized conditions. The pain-free
<br>
walking distance improved in both groups. There was a mean increase of
<br>
60.6 m in the group who received 120 mg Ginkgo biloba extract daily and a
<br>
statistically significant higher mean increase of 107.0 m in the group who
<br>
were treated with the higher dosage. Both dosage regimens investigated in
<br>
this study led to an improvement of the pain-free walking distance after
<br>
24 weeks of treatment. The superiority of the higher dosage over the
<br>
standard dosage was statistically significant. Both treatment variations
<br>
were safe and well tolerated. 
<br>
Green tea extract decreases iron-induced free radical damage 
<br>
Full source: J Nutr 99, Vol. 129, Iss. 12, Pgs. 2130-2134 
<br>
Regular tea consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of cancer.
<br>
Green tea contains catechins with antioxidant properties. In one study,
<br>
cells grown with or without green tea extract were treated with iron as an
<br>
oxidative stimulus for 2 hours. Supplementation with green tea extract
<br>
significantly decreased malondialdehyde production and DNA damage after
<br>
iron oxidative treatment. (Malondialdehyde is a lipid peroxidation
<br>
product, believed to be a marker of radical generation and tissue damage).
<br>
In cells untreated with green tea, there was no effect on membrane
<br>
distribution of (n-3) fatty acids due to iron treatment. It is likely that
<br>
the protective effects can be attributed to epigallocatechin gallate,
<br>
which is present mainly (670 g/kg) in green tea extract. This supports a
<br>
protective effect of green tea against free radical damage.
