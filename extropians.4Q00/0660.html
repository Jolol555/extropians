<em>&gt; I think you have a very solid understanding of the mechanisms involved in this

</em><br>
<p>Point taken, but the construct view can &quot;win&quot; under the same
<br>
circumstances.  And it is, at best, a short-term win: oppression breeds
<br>
resentment, which attracts people to the opposition, and encourages the
<br>
use of more force by both sides (thus spending resources that could be
<br>
used for other things - best example: wars).  Enlightenment, education,
<br>
and open debate, on the other hand, attracts people to the side best
<br>
supported by the facts - whether or not that side starts off dominant.
<br>
<p>I was talking about the more permanent win.  Most of today's first world
<br>
citizens, for instance, agree on the mechanism by which modern human
<br>
beings come into being, and hold a markedly different view than their
<br>
ancestors of some millenia ago.

<p>Have you ever read the stories behind Battletech, in particular Comstar?
<br>
(For those who haven't: Comstar started out as an interstellar
<br>
telephone network, which devolved over time into a religious group that
<br>
honestly believed that one had to execute a certain prayer - not
<br>
involving any interface with the machinery - just so in order to send a
<br>
message.)
