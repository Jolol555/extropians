<em>&gt; I see.  That explains the absense of bickering on the list, between &gt;H and

<p>I don't know if that were comparable. Now, if we had, say, a celebrity death
<br>
match between Eli and Eugene at the next Extro... that might be fun to watch...

<em>&gt; That much I agree with.  Many leaders of Labor and Likud still bitterly despise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other for acts allegedly committed by the other during the British Mandate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rabin was assassinated by a fellow Jew who believed he was betraying them by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; giving away land deeded to them by God.  Why, meetings of the Knesset are almost

<p>See what happens when your country doesn't have an American football league???
