<p>For heavens sake.  How is this supposed to convince somebody who's

someone's mind* if you explained yourself!  :p

jumping off a building and saying &quot;I'm not going to stop suddenly!

I'm going faster and faster!&quot;  Answering this (wrong, but initially
<br>
plausible) intuition might actually do some GOOD.]

<p><em>&gt; Oh, you really are a mess, aren't you? Resources do not get

<p>Truuue, but just saying so isn't enough.  Oil *looks* like it gets
<br>
destroyed when it's used.  How will your comment change someone's mind
<br>
about that intuition?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Every technological advancement allows the amount of resources
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; decreases the amount of resources you need to live an ever higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard of living. Get off the Malthusian BS, he was disproven long
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>So instead of actually naming a technology or two, you just assert that
<br>
technology will continue to increase our productivity.  Do you see why
<br>
this doesn't help?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes, but they were working from an ascending paradigm.  Extropianism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Gnosticism reversed, the exact same stand within a descending paradigm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, its an ascending paradigm based on factual data.  I quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand how you are so confused.
</em><br>
<p>Who's THAT supposed to convince?  Just *claiming* that your beliefs
<br>
are based on facts is no argument!
<br>
<p>Now, maybe you don't have time to give a reasonably complete list of
<br>
facts or supporting arguments or whatever.  But, if so, you didn't
<br>
actually have time to provide a good argument.  And a bad argument is
<br>
much worse than no argument at all.
