<em>&gt; &gt; Damien, My major problem with this attitude on the part of the Swedes is that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't know hardly anything that is completely safe.  Do you suppose that as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they start to notice the harmful aspects of common household and industrial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; substances they will begin outlawing those substances retroactively?  Will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note they're not banning _everything_.  They're saying substances which are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persistent and bioaccumulative are banned unless they can be shown to not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toxic.  Does that really seem like a bad idea?
</em><br>
<p>As I pointed out, the problem is that the rules will likely be used
<br>
much more broadly than in the reasonable way you mention
<br>
above. Retroactive banning is not that far off, I seem to recall a few
<br>
products being subjected to that (the most famous case involved a very
<br>
effective anti-mosquito salve, that was banned just before a record
<br>
mosquito year - producing a thriving black market and a lot of likely
<br>
worse substitutes), and extending it against new things if not legally
<br>
then at least rhetorically is also popular. 
<br>
<p>The problem isn't that we require people to demonstrate that their
<br>
products are safe before they are released widely, the problem is that
<br>
risk aversiveness combined with technocratic governments can be a
<br>
serious and dangerous brake. I think we can avoid getting future PCB
<br>
and mercury disasters without having to rely on heavyhanded
<br>
interventions and fearful pessimism.
<br>
<p>The trick is to make it uneconomical to produce anything that may have
<br>
very bad long term effects, for example by having to pay a
<br>
compensation. The producer would be motivated to make the risk smaller
<br>
than the potential profit. Then we might need to think about some fine
<br>
tuning so that we get a good safety margin and can deal with
<br>
short-term companies (&quot;In today's fluid goo market, this company won't
<br>
be around in five years - it will have become something else by
<br>
then. So I don't have to worry about mutations in my nanites over that
<br>
timespan.&quot;)
