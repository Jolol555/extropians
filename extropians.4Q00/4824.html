<em>&gt; &gt; When I was a little kid, I remember assigning scientific rules to things that were

</em><br>
<em>&gt; vessel, and popping it in an oven), and restrict yourself to just four PSE symbols.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Modern variation of this, augmented with advances in analytics is combinatorial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemistry. Creating molecular libraries, brimming with diversity, and screen for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a desired property.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; compounds had structural reasons for their construction.  I think kids have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pretty good grasp of reality in terms of ghosts that don't exist or Santa Claus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they are grounded in reality.
</em><br>
<p>I could see why.  I was thinking I could see how now to put the correct orbitals and
<br>
ions to actually make a compound from the elements in proper ratios, but it probably
<br>
wouldn't accomplish the task for which it was designed.
<br>
<p>I think computer simulation of chemical combinatorics is already used and will be much
<br>
better in the future.
<br>
<p>So maybe that is one way we learn, we learn in different contexts and then the
<br>
intermediate material that bridges the two.
<br>
<p>About the computer simulation, if the compound reaction rules work correctly then very
<br>
large numbers of combinations could be tried in short order.
<br>
<p>By copyright laws, you each have copyright on your own genes, so they may never be
<br>
patented by a foreign power.  Only new genes may be patented, until they belong to
<br>
somebody.  So, for example, a gene for a spider that allowed the harvesting of some
<br>
life-saving material might be able to be patented, but a cure for some disease that is a
<br>
mutation not present in humans is less patentable when used.  Any use of gene structure
<br>
knowledge that already exists in humans belongs to them.  Well, this has been a change
<br>
of subject.
