<p>While this is a frequent criticism of the HDTV marketplace, it is not
<br>
very accurate at present.  Looking at
<br>
<a href="http://www.ce.org/market_overview/market_overview_stationinfo.asp?area=21">http://www.ce.org/market_overview/market_overview_stationinfo.asp?area=21</a>,
<br>
of current DTV broadcasters I count 53 using high definition and only 11
<br>
using standard.  Consumers need essentially the same equipment to receive
<br>
either an HD or SD TV signal, and for the expense they are shelling out,
<br>
they want to receive HD.  Broadcasters get a lot of complaints when they
<br>
provide low quality images for those multi $K sets.
<br>
<p>In the long run it MAY be that broadcasters will switch more to SDTV,
<br>
but we don't know this for sure and it will ultimately come down to
<br>
market preferences.
