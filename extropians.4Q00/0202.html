<p>I think we agree.

<p>All I really need to argue is that the initial measure I proposed is
<br>
not substantially worse than the implicit measure used by our existing
<br>
democracy.  But I welcome proposals for improved welfare measures.
<br>
We can begin the trial and error you refer to now, if we have the time,
<br>
by constructing hypothetical decisions and comparing our intuitions about
<br>
the right decision with the choices preferred by various welfare measures.
<br>
<p>For example, I proposed summing log(GDP) per each demographic group, but this
<br>
leaves open the question of what the zero point is for being dead.  That is,
<br>
log(0) = negative infinity, so if dead people were taken as having zero GDP,
<br>
that would put an infinite weight on avoiding death, which is clearly too
<br>
high.  I think people tend to put a value of about twice their annual income
<br>
on living another year.  I'm not sure how to express this in the log 
<br>
framework.
