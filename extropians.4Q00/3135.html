<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE, DECEMBER 1 2000

<br>
<p>HIV discovery holds promise
<br>
<p>Three separate reports published in the November 21 issue of the
<br>
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences announced the discovery of
<br>
how the retrovirus HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) exits infected cells
<br>
to spread to other cells.  Anthony Fauci, Director of the National
<br>
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the organization who
<br>
collaborated on one of the studies, commented, &quot;We know more about HIV
<br>
than about any other virus, and yet it continues to reveal new secrets.
<br>
This discovery provides another example of how HIV manipulates T cells for
<br>
its own survival and sheds light on a poorly understood type of virus-cell
<br>
interaction.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the NIAID study, a team led by Ulrich Schubert, Ph.D studied the
<br>
ubiquitin-proteasome system in CD4+ T cells, the immune system cells
<br>
targeted by HIV.  Ubiquitin is a polypeptide consisting of seventy-six
<br>
amino acids, and the proteasome has been compared to the cell's garbage
<br>
disposal, which collects and destroys old, damaged or unnecessary
<br>
proteins.  Ubiquitin determines the proteins' fate in the proteasome by
<br>
flagging proteins.  Researchers found this system to be necessary to the
<br>
release of a retrovirus from the surface of cells, called budding.  When
<br>
the system was shut down by the researchers, the virus' ability to exit
<br>
the cells was impaired, and those that were able to leave the infected
<br>
cells frequently failed to properly mature which diminished their
<br>
virulence.  Dr Schubert explained, &quot;Besides being able to spread by direct
<br>
cell contact, HIV can bud from one cell if it is going to infect others,
<br>
and by blocking the ubiquitin-proteasome system we partially prevent that
<br>
from happening.  Of the viruses that do manage to escape the surface, many
<br>
fail to complete the biochemical changes that usually occur after they
<br>
leave the cell, making them less able to infect new cells.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr Schubert and Jonathan Yewdell, MD, PhD and Director of the NIAID lab in
<br>
which the above research was done agree that an understanding of the
<br>
interaction between the virus and the ubiquitin-proteasome system of the
<br>
cell may uncover new methods of fighting HIV.  Other research published in
<br>
the PNAS journal which aids in the understanding of the subject was
<br>
conducted at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute at Harvard and at Penn State
<br>
College of Medicine.  Penn State's John Wills, PhD believes that other
<br>
retroviruses use ubiquitin in a similar manner and stated, &quot;If these
<br>
viruses use a common mechanism for virus budding, this raises the
<br>
possibility of developing a single antiviral drug for a wide spectrum of
<br>
viral diseases. This is rather like the idea behind broad-spectrum
<br>
antibiotics, where one drug can be effective against more than one strain
<br>
of bacteria.&quot;
<br>
<p>PROTOCOLS
<br>
HIV
<br>
<p>Several significant studies have shown that HIV infection progresses when
<br>
serum levels of the hormone DHEA begin to decline (J. Infect. Dis., 1991,
<br>
1992; AIDS Res. Hum. Retrovir., 1994). Many people with HIV have
<br>
incorporated DHEA into their treatment program because maintaining healthy
<br>
blood levels of DHEA might prevent immune degradation from progressing to
<br>
general immune system collapse. Its beneficial mechanism of action may not
<br>
be due to any direct antiviral effect, but rather to DHEA's ability to
<br>
protect immune functions against a wide variety of insults.
<br>
<p>The Foundation recommends that all people with HIV and most people over 40
<br>
have their DHEA blood level tested to determine their baseline level. DHEA
<br>
supplementation should then be initiated and monitored to bring their
<br>
serum level up to that of a healthy 21-year-old. An appropriate dosage for
<br>
men is 25 mg, 2 to 3 times a day.
<br>
<p>DHEA can possibly increase liver damage in people who already have
<br>
hepatitis and cirrhosis. Before starting DHEA replacement therapy, please
<br>
consult with your physician and refer to the DHEA-Pregnenolone Precautions
<br>
in the DHEA Replacement Therapy protocol.
<br>
<p>Thousands of research studies have proven the positive effect antioxidants
<br>
have in managing immune suppression. The Life Extension Foundation (in
<br>
1985) was the first organization to propose that decline in the immune
<br>
function of people with HIV might be prevented or slowed down by taking
<br>
high-potency antioxidant supplements. According to Marianna Baum, Ph.D.,
<br>
from the University of Miami Medical School, &quot;multiple nutritional
<br>
abnormalities occur relatively early in the course of HIV infection and
<br>
appear to facilitate disease progression&quot; (VIIIth Int. Conf. AIDS, 1992).

<br>
<p>DHEA REPLACEMENT
<br>
<p>Properly managed DHEA therapy can be useful for most older men and women
<br>
to increase energy, vitality, and to foster an overall youthful feeling.
<br>
However, there are guidelines that should be followed for safe long-term
<br>
use of DHEA.
<br>
<p>When taking oral supplements of DHEA, it is important that antioxidants
<br>
are available to the liver because DHEA can promote free radicals in liver
<br>
cells. Animal studies have shown that extremely high doses (from 2000 to
<br>
10,000 mg DHEA daily in human terms) caused liver damage in mice and rats.
<br>
When antioxidants were given along with the DHEA, liver damage did not
<br>
occur despite the massive doses of DHEA being administered to these
<br>
animals. It should be noted that the amount of DHEA shown to cause liver
<br>
damage is 20 times more than is necessary to produce antiaging benefits.
<br>
Green tea, vitamin E, and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) are antioxidants that
<br>
have been shown to be especially effective in suppressing free radicals in
<br>
the liver.
<br>
<p>A DHEA-s blood test should be taken 3 to 6 weeks after beginning DHEA
<br>
therapy to help determine optimal dosing. Some people neglect to test
<br>
their blood levels of DHEA and wind up chronically taking the wrong dose.
<br>
When having your blood tested for DHEA, blood should be drawn 3 to 4 hours
<br>
after the last dose. DHEA testing can save you money if it shows that you
<br>
can take less DHEA to maintain youthful DHEA serum levels.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>DHEA 25 mg capsules
<br>
<p>In 1981, The Life Extension Foundation introduced DHEA
<br>
(dehydroepiandrosterone) through an article that described the multiple
<br>
anti-aging benefits this hormone might produce. The public learned about
<br>
DHEA in 1996, as the benefits of DHEA were touted by the news media and in
<br>
several popular books.
<br>
<p>DHEA obtained credibility in the medical establishment when the New York
<br>
Academy of Sciences published a book entitled DHEA AND AGING. This highly
<br>
technical book provided scientific validation for the many life extension
<br>
effects of DHEA replacement therapy.
<br>
<p>The Life Extension Foundation has been investigating DHEA for more than 17
<br>
years. The Foundation now has more inside information about DHEA research
<br>
and its clinical use than any other organization on earth. Only The Life
<br>
Extension Foundation publishes a DHEA Protocol that enables people to use
<br>
DHEA safely by providing specific dosing and blood testing schedules. The
<br>
DHEA Protocol can save people money by enabling them to consume less DHEA,
<br>
while still obtaining optimal benefit from taking DHEA. In more than 2,000
<br>
published studies, DHEA has been shown to have a role in improving
<br>
neurological function, immune function, stress disorders, hormonal
<br>
modulation and numerous diseases associated with normal aging.

<p>Mega-L-Glutathione Capsules
<br>
<p>Despite all the published studies showing that garlic, selenium,
<br>
alpha-lipoic acid, cysteine and N-acetylcysteine can boost cellular
<br>
glutathione levels, some people want to take high doses of the expensive
<br>
amino acid glutathione.
<br>
<p>For those with cataracts and liver disease, it may be desired to take 500
<br>
mg a day of this very potent amino acid.
<br>
<p>L-Glutathione is a biologically active sulfur amino acid tripeptide
<br>
compound containing three amino acids L-cysteine, L-glutamic acid and
<br>
glycine.
