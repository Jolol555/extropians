<em>&gt; Yes, anyone who has read either uplift trilogy will see how he blithely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepts ideas of government enforced eugenics programs applied to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of a species, should see how he is no libertarian, although he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did redeem a bit in the second trilogy (Brightness Reef, Infinity's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shore, Heaven's Reach) by depicting a society of 'sooners' of several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species illegally colonizing a fallow world, and sympathized with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view of a more anarchical society and against dogma, fascism, and force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He is smarmily two faced about things, and is right to understand that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'wishywashy' individuals like himself are no good.
</em><br>
<p>I still don't see what's wrong with presenting and supporting two different
<br>
sides of an issue and being able to either empathize with or oppose both.  I
<br>
think that's a sign of a flexible mind and a skilled artist- not being &quot;two
<br>
faced&quot; (which we all are, whether we admit it or not).

<p>&quot;We do progress, but how?  Not by the tinkering of the meliorist; not by the
<br>
crushing of initiative; not by laws and regulations which hamstring the
<br>
racehorse, and handcuff the boxer; but by the innovations of the eccentric,
<br>
by the phantasies of the hashish-dreamer of philosophy, by the aspirations
<br>
of the idealist to the impossible, by the imagination of the revolutionary,
<br>
by the perilous adventure of the pioneer.  Progress is by leaps and bounds,
<br>
by breaking from custom, by working on untried experiments; in short, by the
<br>
follies and crimes of men of genius, only recognizable as wisdom and virtue
<br>
after they have been tortured to death, and their murderers reap gloatingly
<br>
the harvest of the seeds they sowed at midnight.&quot; -Aleister Crowley, &quot;On
<br>
