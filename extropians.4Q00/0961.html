Cybernetic Totalism is just fine, as long as one includes the factor of 
<br>
giving the Singularity enough time to get here. It may, after all, be quite a 
<br>
long wait; a very , very long wait! Lanier comes across (to me) as if he 
<br>
doesn't have a solution, therefore, none must exist. If this is true then 
<br>
Lanier's argument as well as Bill Joy the Killjoy's arguments are specious 
<br>
for that reason alone.  There are many minds we have not heard from, in the 
<br>
world, and many minds, in the future to come. This is no reason to be 
<br>
sanguine and not do what we can today, but we are not, as yet transhuman, and 
<br>
can only do a little. The future waits for the problem-solvers.

<p>&lt;&lt; I found some of the points rather tonic, but the overall impression
<br>
&nbsp;wasn't that high. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;What he is aiming at is disproving or undermining the *unconsidered*
<br>
&nbsp;ideology of technological eschatology. To some extent I agree with him
<br>
&nbsp;- there is an awful amount of badly thought out fluff on this (I am
<br>
&nbsp;myself responsible for some of it :-), and if we seriously want this
<br>
&nbsp;to be a part of our culture or even a powerful part of our culture,
<br>
&nbsp;then we better make sure our thinking is high-quality, or we have a
<br>
&nbsp;high risk of ending up in a lot of the old memetic traps. Which can be
<br>
&nbsp;rather bad if combined with powerful technology and ideas about some
<br>
&nbsp;technocalyptic manifest destiny.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;The problem is that his attack misses the mark in many places. He
<br>
&nbsp;points out some flawed arguments or assumptions often glossed over
<br>
&nbsp;that really needs to be thought about carefully, but dismisses many
<br>
&nbsp;aspects with handwaving (like AI) or the flawed software argument
<br>
&nbsp;(that argument could be applied to engineering too - we are using
<br>
&nbsp;imperfect tools and making mistakes, which we correct with failsafes,
<br>
&nbsp;redundancy and quality assurance measures, so in the end all our
<br>
&nbsp;designs will be ISO 9000 certified inoperable piles of redundancy,
<br>
&nbsp;right?). 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;I think this is not a good piece in itself, but it is the kind of
<br>
&nbsp;piece that will be cited in some circles rather widely. A good
<br>
&nbsp;rebuttal, or even better another half of a manifesto, would be
<br>
&nbsp;useful. Even better, we should see how we can polish up transhumanist
<br>
&nbsp;thinking in order not to fall into the traps he describes.
