I am investigating &quot;white powder gold&quot;. Let me give you a brief rundown of what
<br>
I understand the substance to be.
<br>
White Powder Gold (WPG) is made from gold. The refining process is fairly
<br>
straight forward but it requires expensive equipment and an excellent command of
<br>
analytical chemistry.
<br>
WPG can be classified the same as other precious metals such as Rhodium, Cesium
<br>
etc. Beyond this relation to the periodic table WPG exhibits significant
<br>
differences. First it is a super-conductor, that is to say that under laboratory
<br>
testing it proved to have no resistance, in fact voltage was absorbed. Voltage
<br>
passed through it when it matched the sample's (WPG) frequency.
<br>
When mixed with water WPG forms a gelatinous mixture. When ingested it has the
<br>
following affects.
<br>
&quot;Every cell in your body will be taken back to the state it is supposed to be,
<br>
when you were a teenager or a child. It perfects the DNA, and closes the light
<br>
within the body until you literally reach a point where the light body exceeds
<br>
the physical body.&quot;
<br>
&quot; The gifts that go with this are perfect telepathy, you can know good and evil
<br>
when it is in the room with you, you can project your thoughts into someone
<br>
else's mind, you can levitate, you can walk on water, because it is flowing so
<br>
much light in you, you literally don't attract to gravity.&quot;
<br>
There is much more to this substance that I will leave out for now. The link to
<br>
the past is this.
<br>
&quot;There is some material from ancient Egypt that provides some insight into this
<br>
white powder, it is called the Egyptian Book of the Dead and the Papyrus of Ani,
<br>
by Budge. This is the oldest book of the Dead, found about 3500 BC in the tomb
<br>
of Pepi the 2nd. It says, I am purified of all imperfections, what is it? I sin
<br>
like the golden hawk of Horus, what is it? I pass by the immortals without
<br>
dying, what is it? I come before my father in heaven, what is it? It goes on and
<br>
on, always asking what is it?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Do you know that the Hebrews worked in Egypt for many generations, they were
<br>
the artisans and metallurgists. When they left Egypt, Bezalial the goldsmith
<br>
prepared the bread of the presence of god. Bezalial prepared this bread that the
<br>
high priest partook of, the mellets(sp?) of that priest.
<br>
The word in Hebrew that literally means What is it? is Manna. The word manna
<br>
literally translates verbatim to a question, What is it? Look in the travels of
<br>
Josephus and you will see that this is so. The very same words that were used in
<br>
Old Kingdom Egypt in 3500 BC.&quot;
<br>
&quot;In fact, if you ask a Rabbi if he ever heard of the white powder of gold, he
<br>
says, yes, we know of the white powder of gold, but to our knowledge no one
<br>
knows how to make it since the destruction of the first Temple, the Temple of
<br>
Solomon.
<br>
This knowledge was not completely lost, the high priests who left the temple
<br>
when it was destroyed went out on the desert and organized the community known
<br>
as Qumrun, they were the Essenes. If you get copies of the Dead Sea Scrolls
<br>
Uncovered, which Eiseman and Wise just translated, this in ancient Egypt was
<br>
known as the GOLDEN TEAR from the EYE OF HORUS.&quot;
<br>
This is some background for you. My question is this. Has anyone heard of this
<br>
substance before. Have you ever read about it in ancient manuscripts?
<br>
If yes, please let me know where I can learn more.

<br>
And so, I was really pleased when I went to Global Sciences in the Spring of
<br>
last year and spoke for the first time. I told Dean Stonier, don't advertise
<br>
this, don't tell anyone what I am going to talk about. And I really was pleased
<br>
to see how many people had read the books I was referring to, knew about it,
<br>
were prepared for it, and they just were in awe over it. And so, you know, that
<br>
was so well received, I spoke in the Fall once again to Global Sciences on this
<br>
side of the country. I've been over to Hawaii and am now speaking here. I, I
<br>
only have so much material being produced. Most of it's going for medical
<br>
studies and philosophical studies and there isn't that much available. You know,
<br>
we're not charging for it for most people, it's being given for free. And so,
<br>
ah, you know, there isn't enough that I can play with it, just do what I want
<br>
with it, so.....

<br>
&quot;Do you know that when we heated it and cooled it and heated it and cooled it
<br>
and heated it and cooled it under helium or argon that when we cooled it it
<br>
would weigh three to four hundred percent of it's beginning weight and when we
<br>
heated it it would actually weigh less than nothing.  If it wasn't in the pan,
<br>
the pan would weigh more than the pan weighs when this stuff is in it.
<br>
Keep in mind these are highly trained people running this instrumentation and
<br>
they would come in and say take a look at this.  This makes no sense at all.
<br>
Now this machine is so precisely designed and controlled that they actually
<br>
have a magnetic material that you can actually put into this machine that is
<br>
non magnetic when it goes in the machine and at 300 degrees it becomes
<br>
magnetic.  It actually is a strong magnet.  Then after you get up to 900
<br>
degrees it loses it's magnetism.  And you can actually see if the
<br>
interreaction of the magnetism with the magnetic field of the heating element
<br>
caused any change in weight.&quot; --David Hudson

We take that out, take half the sample, place in another vial and seal it,
<br>
returning the other half of this gray powder to the furnace where it is cooked
<br>
at 1000 degrees under argon, and it turns SNOW WHITE. We take that out, put it
<br>
in another vial, seal it and send all the three sealed samples out for
<br>
spectroscopic analysis.

<p>Etherium Gold
<br>
<a href="http://www.etherium.com/gold.htm">http://www.etherium.com/gold.htm</a>
<br>
Etherium Gold is a naturally occurring trace mineral containing precious
<br>
elements thought to be used in ceremony by ancient cultures to advance initiates
<br>
into higher states of consciousness. Etherium Gold appears to enhance
<br>
interconnectivity between the nervous system and the vast network of connective
<br>
tissue throughout the body. Dr. Gerber points out that Etherium Gold may achieve
<br>
this because it contains trace amounts of rare monatomic elements such as gold,
<br>
rhodium, and iridium (results obtained from laser spectrophotometric neutron
<br>
activation) that may produce a kind of natural biological superconductivity that
<br>
enhances communication between the nervous system and the various tissues of the
<br>
body.

Only in very recent times have medical scientists identified the hormonal
<br>
secretion of the pineal gland, finally isolating it in 1968. The essence was
<br>
called melatonin, which means 'night worker' (from the Greek, melos, meaning
<br>
'black', and tosos, meaning 'labour'). Those with a high melatonin output react
<br>
strongly against sunlight because it affects their mental capability; they are
<br>
essentially night operatives. Melatonin is called the 'hormone of darkness' as
<br>
it is produced only at night or in the dark. Exposure to an excess of sunlight
<br>
actually makes the pineal gland smaller and lessens spiritual awareness, whereas
<br>
darkness and high pineal activity enhance the keen intuitive knowledge of the
<br>
subtle mind while reducing the stress factor.
