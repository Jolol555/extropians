<em>&gt; People that know very little about mysticism (and knowing only the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystics &quot;simply believe&quot;.  Some types of mystics believe that reason is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supreme and transcends its own seeming limits if applied rigorously and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honestly enough.  Check out Jnana Yoga.  Science for all of its acheivments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is so far up against the wall on value and &quot;meaning of it all&quot; type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions and issues.  Some go so far as to say that if science cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; address these things then they do not exist!  This is as blind as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medievalist claiming that what is not in the bible is either false or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important anyway.  Mysticism/religion sucks at describing physical reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But then, that was not its stated intent.  Foretelling the future is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not its purpose all though some mystical/religous groups lower themselves to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acting as if it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I guess we can play with the definition of mysticism in all kinds of ways. 
<br>
Actually, religion has tried its hand describing physicial reality; it got 
<br>
shifted to the &quot;spiritual&quot; realm only when it was shown its descriptions were 
<br>
valueless. Value and &quot;meaning of it all&quot; issues aren't the province of 
<br>
science. They can certainly have weight, since they influence our behavior, 
<br>
but they are less &quot;real&quot; than, say, gravity. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    &gt; Capital 'P' Powers are not amazing or incredible, they are merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &gt; inscrutable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    If they're inscrutable, they very well could be amazing and incredible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    don't know this- nor do I.&lt;&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Having, in the past, found that events and phenomena that were previously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    inscrutable (how did the sun burn, for example) have been logically and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    falsifiably explained, one can logically infer that what is now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inscrutable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    will also, eventually, be logically and falsifiably explained. To believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    otherwise is to deny four centuries of human progress. Now, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    that at some point we might run into a wall that science and reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    knock down -- but if one must have faith in something, I thing faith in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    science and reason is more sensible -- they have delivered a great deal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    than the alternatives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; samantha:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually not all things believed to be true in science are falsfiable today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From the fact that science and technology have delivered much it does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow that all else is utterly pointless and to be discarded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I'm not really saying that -- science is just a tool, not an end unto itself. 
<br>
I think religion is largely a waste of time, but that's a personal 
<br>
preference. What is great about science is that it's self-correcting; when 
<br>
observations contradict scientific &quot;dogma,&quot; the dogma will be modified 
<br>
accordingly. For all we know relativity could be proven dead wrong in a 
<br>
hundred years (or more likely, merely shown to be an incomplete model of 
<br>
reality) and our descendants (or maybe us, courtesy of some good biotech) 
<br>
will look upon things like the concept of unchanging speed of light with the 
<br>
same amusement as we look at Ptolemy's model of the universe.
