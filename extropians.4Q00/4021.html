<p><p><em>&gt;Some thermostats alter the absolute temp they switch on at depending on

</em><br>
<em>&gt;variably based on time of day, and depending on whether the room is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;occupied, and occupied by particular people.
</em><br>
<p>If they are making these decisions, however complex, from programming,
<br>
then they are finite-state. If they are altering their circuitry in response
<br>
to
<br>
feedback loop from the environment, then they might be infinite-state
<br>
(analog).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Human brains are not infinite state either, and you still have not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;provided any evidence that they are in fact conscious.
</em><br>
<p>Human brains are 'plastic' and rewire their circuitry. This is
<br>
not disputed by anybody, except by you it seems.
<br>
<p>The physical &quot;brain&quot; is not conscious in the sense that you
<br>
could stick it with a pin and it wouldn't feel pain (no nerve
<br>
endings). But we, organisms including our brains have
<br>
&quot;experience&quot;, mental life or &quot;self-referential consciousness.&quot; Only
<br>
radical behaviourists deny this, are you a Skinnerian? If so
<br>
I can trot out the standard refutation of this position .......
<br>
<p>The brain generates the virtual sensor(gan) in so that part
<br>
of our biosphere is non-material ... like can only interact
<br>
with like ... thoughts, dreams &amp;c. are hallucinations or illusions
<br>
and can take place in/ interact with an organ that is purely matter.
<br>
This is Spinoza &amp; Leibnitz case against Descartes' pineal gland
<br>
theory. MVT overcomes such objections.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turing machines are hard-wired and cannot evince PHASIC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TRANSIENT behaviour ... correct me if I am wrong? R.E.M.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I would claim is a random-like phenomena because E-1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains are still (in long evolution terms) changing from finite to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite-state.
</em><br>
<p>random-like is not the same as random.
<br>
<p>You are avoiding the point ... besides, perhaps pure randomness
<br>
is just a concept and does not exist in nature? Rapid eye movements
<br>
*seem* random in the same way that phasic transients *seem* random.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt;Consciousness requires a degree of self-organisation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Ah, first they must self organise, then they must be
<br>
self-disorganised... You seem confused.
<br>
<p>In order to make an *independent* response to the environment some
<br>
degree of &quot;self&quot; (organisation/ choice/ reaction) seems necessary.
<br>
A robot that blindly follows a set of instructions and cannot make
<br>
independent
<br>
volitions has no &quot;self&quot; or central executive, but is just a slave machine.
<br>
Yes, the ability of the brain to self-organise (or internally organise, if
<br>
you dislike
<br>
the term &quot;self&quot;) is basic ..  and indeed, human embryos spend up to 24 hrs a
<br>
day
<br>
in REM before birth at certain stages, and well after birth the neuronal
<br>
circuits
<br>
form and reform. There is a massive volume of data on ontogeny ... if you
<br>
insist I
<br>
will bore this list with reams of references?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The debate seems to centre on the problems resolving Leibnitz Law ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that to be truly &quot;identical&quot; the two things in question must be fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interchangeable. Sense-data (experience) and the conscious sensor/ self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to be different types ... this is the problem for brain-mind identity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theorists. However, MVT explains the virtual sensor(gan), the phantom
</em><br>
median
<br>
<em>&gt; eye, which gives the persistent experience of self in terms of generation
</em><br>
(action
<br>
<em>&gt; potential signals &amp;c) of the *same* generic neuronal information as the
</em><br>
sense-data
<br>
<em>&gt; (contents of consciousness).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't think so. Identity is not an issue of consciousness, it is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issue of discretion.
</em><br>
<p>The loci of experience, and the mechanisms that give rise to it are
<br>
very pertinent to the parallel discussion about uploading &amp;c. Cogito ergo
<br>
sum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a major reason why MVT is important, most theories of mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Descartes' dualist account) fail on this point. Brains are necessary, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient for consciousness (they could be in mu-state ... don't you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree?)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;You have to be kidding. Brainless awareness? Excuse me? Cites please,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cites.
</em><br>
<p>What I am saying is that brain-dead (mu-state) means NO awareness.
<br>
The brain is not only a circuit, but needs to be in infinite state. I tend
<br>
to
<br>
think insect neuronal clusters, and even hagfish &amp; lampreys (E-2 brains)
<br>
are not conscious. If the word conscious is a problem, use sentience or
<br>
even qualify as &quot;self-referential consciousness.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As to whether I can *prove* that you are conscious (whoever &quot;me/ you&quot; are)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... I don't want to get bogged down in individual cases because of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of solipsism. Do you accept that dreams happen? If you do, then you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowing me that the dreamers (in general, whether birds, mammal, or
</em><br>
*you*)
<br>
<em>&gt; have consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>Do you claim that dreams are anything more than automated backup/sorting
<br>
of buffer data stored in short term memory?
<br>
<p>Yes, I agree with Globus (Real Time Hypothesis) that REM occurs during the
<br>
day
<br>
but is harder to detect, and with Aristotle that we are nearer to our true
<br>
&quot;self&quot;
<br>
when dreaming and mentation is not interrupted by external 'noise.' I also
<br>
agree
<br>
partly with Freud, and think that dreams are a way of rehearsing behaviour
<br>
(such
<br>
as sex) without taking risk of actually engaging in the world. We build and
<br>
destroy
<br>
models of reality when dreaming ... I also think that consolidation and
<br>
reinforcement of
<br>
memory (and discard activity) happens during dream, both REM and non-REM.
<br>
<p>Your view is too narrow, and ignores loads of evidence. But at least you
<br>
accept
<br>
dreams (a form of conscious event) occur!
