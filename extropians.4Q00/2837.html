<p><p><em>&gt; I don't want to waste time on semantical arguments here ...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Pursuant to this I'd like to strip away some of the limiting ideological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;garbage found in this conversation.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I think you're reading too much into what I'm saying Steve.  Let's try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;keep this simple.
</em><br>
<p>Assuming that everything is simple is a BIG mistake.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;.By definition, &quot;limiting belief structures&quot; are -limiting.-  In some way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, in many cases we can objectively determine the general impact of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;limitations and assign a general consequence to the persistence of such.
</em><br>
<p>For instance:
<br>
<p>The Jehovah's Witness' are averse to blood transfusions.  JW Betty requires
<br>
a blood transfusion to live.  Facilities exist to undertake the procedure in
<br>
a timely fashion.  In the absence of her ability to remove and/or
<br>
&quot;hack-around&quot; (oh, just this one time,) her ideology, she will die.
<br>
<p>But the Jehova Witness is making a value judgement that some things
<br>
come before life &amp; death even, and the emotional attachment to this wish
<br>
for/
<br>
belief in an afterlife wins out. We might think they are wrong and limited,
<br>
but
<br>
they think the same about your outlook.
<br>
<p><p>Or:
<br>
<p>Joe is a talented, intelligent introvert, and, like most humans, has an
<br>
unfortified self-esteem.  Joe holds the belief that &quot;doing nothing&quot; is
<br>
better than publicly failing in the attempt.  Joe procrastinates his goals.
<br>
Joe puts off that book he wants to write until &quot;he has a firmer grasp on
<br>
it.&quot;  Joe doesn't talk to the nice girl in the checkout line.
<br>
<p>Joe's belief does not come out of thin air,, but is presumably a
<br>
stimulus-response
<br>
based on unpleasantness of previous public ridicule/ failings.
<br>
Circumspection
<br>
should not be dismissed out of hand since every individual and situation is
<br>
unique. Joe might not want to be seen as someone who is always hitting on
<br>
girls.
<br>
<p>Or:
<br>
<p>Theo believes that a passing comet is an alien space-ship, which he can
<br>
board by means of destroying his earth-bound material existence...
<br>
<p>How is this belief &quot;limiting&quot;? Mad, probably, but not limiting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now, we can debate whether a particular belief structure is limiting or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advantageous, but if we -agree- that a particular belief structure is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;limiting, wouldn't you also hold that striping away such an ideology is of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;benefit?
</em><br>
<p>Not every &quot;belief structure&quot; can be intellectualised as you wish.
<br>
Empowerment may be more to do with physical energy level than
<br>
beliefs ... for example, if I have been drinking at lunchtime or am sleepy,
<br>
I just can't be arsed to do much. No beliefs holding me back ...
<br>
<p><p><p>but we have
<br>
<em>&gt; may differing concepts of &quot;belief&quot; ... which I think of as being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional/subconscious to a greater degree than they are explicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and articulated. The notion of stripping away belief structures is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less valid than notions of exorcising psychological imbalance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (through hypnosis and psychotherapy).
</em><br>
<p>Well, it sounds like your saying that the notion of &quot;stripping away&quot; is
<br>
unfeasible, rather than undesirable.  I am not a therapist, nor am I a
<br>
psychologist or neuro-scientist.  So, I can't really speak with intelligence
<br>
on this topic.  I defer expertise of &quot;the means&quot; to those in the know.  You
<br>
can consider my arguments as addressing &quot;the ends.&quot;
<br>
<p>I do not see your oversimplistic view as having any merit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Desirable ends:  Removal of limiting belief structures.
</em><br>
<p>My limiting belief is that I am &quot;mortal&quot; and not superman which stops
<br>
me leaping from tall buildings ... this limiting belief is ESSENTIAL.
<br>
No need to strip anything way, just evaluate your actions/beliefs sensibly.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Remember, personal power is not a bad thing.
</em><br>
<p>So long as other humanoids do not bother me with their aggression or
<br>
political megalomania &amp;c.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You -are- looking to re-invent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yourself as a posthuman entity, aren't you?
</em><br>
<p>No, have been post-human a very long time already.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Aren't you trying to defeat
<br>
<em>&gt;death, liberate your existence from poverty, war, hate and hunger?
</em><br>
<p>All done (so far).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Isn't
<br>
<em>&gt;Transhumanism the ultimate manifestation of the empowerment of the human?
</em><br>
<p>No, the annihilation of the spent idea of &quot;human.&quot; More than human.
<br>
Humans cannot be trusted to run the planet, they are pretty stupid on the
<br>
whole!
<br>
We are try to supersede humans, surely, and establish the next level up the
<br>
phylogenic tree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm talking about -increasing- one's drive for personal power.  Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deflating it (like so many societal factors seem to do.)
</em><br>
<p>OK
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I think we should undertake that goal in a spirit of compassion, as I've
<br>
stated, but do not
<br>
<em>&gt;shrink away from the brass ring!  Do not believe yourself unworthy.
</em><br>
<p>Not a problem I have. I just don't altogether trust everyone else with it
<br>
.....
<br>
<p><em> &gt;As a therapist, sometimes I find it good to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boost the self-esteem and sense of worth of a client (ego-strengthening,
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;Western way) and sometimes it might be useful to deflate the ego and stand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back (ego-dissolution, the Eastern way).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The ability to dissolve one's ego is -also- an expression of personal
</em><br>
power.
<br>
<em>&gt;This is a paradox/truth.
</em><br>
<p>Humility ... yes maybe what your Joe character was exhibiting?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; No, aeons ago our ancestors' behaviour was governed by sunlight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &amp; the primal eye, whereas nowadays our E-1 brains have infinite-state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capability (self-organising) since they are no longer governed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organic (primal eye) external clock.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Gobbledegook.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm ... obviously you haven't studied solid state physics or neural
<br>
computation,
<br>
sorry if I am so far over your head. I can reference you the papers if you
<br>
are able to
<br>
read big words.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Again, I say: &quot;whatever.&quot;  If all behaviour is &quot;pretence,&quot; then -that's-
</em><br>
what
<br>
<em>&gt;behavior is.  We live in a state of pretence-- that doesn't bother me.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is it useful pretence?  Behavioral 'truth' is a pretty darn grey subject,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wouldn't you agree?
</em><br>
<p>If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It is overzealous evangelisers that cause
<br>
problems.
<br>
If their &quot;limiting beliefs&quot; get the Amish or whoever thru
<br>
life .. they aren't complaining ... it is your inflexibility/purism of
<br>
thought
<br>
&nbsp;that creates the problem here, not the poor Amish. We all live in trance!
<br>
&quot;If it gets you through the night, its alright, its alright.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All I am saying is (1) understand this, and (2) use it to your advantage
</em><br>
by
<br>
<em>&gt; writing and editing your own script, don't pretend to be a character that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others have scripted for you. There are better things to be than &quot;human&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is just a tired old legacy label ... but then presumably we are all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after/trans-human and agree with this statement?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Hey, you took the words right out of my mouth.
</em><br>
<p>Believe me, I have considered the issues that bother you previously ...
<br>
let me ask you a question ...
<br>
I can use MVT to devise new types of hypnotic induction (mind control).
<br>
Should I use these techniques to promote my own agenda or not?
