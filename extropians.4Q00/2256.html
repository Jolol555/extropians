<p><em>&gt; Altho it appears as a national embarrassment, the outcome of this election
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  perhaps is the most optimal for libertarians and extropians.  It will 
</em><br>
stress
<br>
<em>&gt;  the need for ditching antiquated technologies in favor of newer and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  workable ones.  Furthermore it stresses the need for better human/machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  interfaces.  Thirdly, regardless of who wins the office, that candidate now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  will be essentially a lame duck for four years, which should emphasize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  fact that our country *does not need* a person leading us in order to
</em><br>

Agreed....
<br>
<p>I think that voting should be done via the internet using some type of crypto 
<br>
arrangement..
<br>
<p>I'm well pleased with the way this election has turned out....in fact the 
<br>
longer it drags on the happier I am.
<br>
<p>On the face of it the fiasco make our government look to be the fool that it 
<br>
is.  Trust in government declines... (or at the very least...doubt 
<br>
increases.)   Which is fine by me.  
<br>
<p>No matter who wins ...as you say.....the winner is a lame duck.
<br>
<p>It gets better......last I heard there were razor thin margins of majority in 
<br>
both houses.  Perhaps the Republicans lead in the senate by one...and in the 
<br>
house by six?  (of course......your milage may vary according to the latest 
<br>
news media &quot;projection&quot; and state recount)
<br>
<p><p>That means that we''re looking at four years of gridlock.  I love it.  In my 
<br>
opinion the onliest thang that government can do is detrimental to my 
<br>
happiness and well being.  If government is locked up...they can't hurt me as 
<br>
much.'
<br>
<p>And it gets better yet....
<br>
<p>It appears to me that the national news media has serious egg on it's face....
<br>
<p>Perhaps....just perhaps.....people might learn to think for themselves just a 
<br>
liiiiiiiiitle bit as a result of this mess?
