</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;obsolete&quot; them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But I'm not there.  I'm irrelevant to this.  It's up to the colonists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with the advanced tech on the scene to decide whether they wish to spend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the resources to aid their fellow, but lower tech, colonists.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could be any number of political considerations, and thus, no guarantee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that those on the first wave would or would not be &quot;obsoleted&quot; and left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; behind...or even &quot;scrapped&quot;, their lives snuffed out so their bodies and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equipment may serve the faster (and probably more powerful) latecomers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, &quot;you&quot; are there.  Or whatever you and others of your kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become.  The decision will be up to us at some point.  And seeing it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that way brings home the fact that intelligent beings will face some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral, ethical questions when they run into this situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now it might well be that nothing could be done due to the constraints
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present.  But you don't irrevocably &quot;scrap&quot; living sentiences unless you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have no morals at all.  Upgrade maybe, but not scrap.
</em><br>
<p>What if said sentiences had made it their life's mission to destroy you
<br>
and everything you held dear, should you and they ever meet?  This would
<br>
make upgrading them a dangerous propsition.  If, further, resources were
<br>
such that only you or they could survive (say, due to an unforseen
<br>
accident), either you or they would likely be scrapped...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Scary, maybe.  But, barring any physical requirements for specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; societal values among advanced civilizations, there's no way to prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the good or the bad must happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Values and morals are not simplistically dependent only on physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requirements.  We choose the values we live by although some part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we value is determined to some extent by the types of creatures we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are.  But we are in the process of re-writing the types of creatures we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are.  So again, it is up to us what we decide to be and why.
</em><br>
<p>Granted, physical requirements aren't the sole determinant of morals.
<br>
However, I am not aware of any other determinant that absolutely forbids
<br>
any given set of morals from being practiced over the long term.  That
<br>
being the case, I do not know of a way to enforce these desired morals
<br>
on a group of settlers who may or may not have any connection to, or
<br>
even knowledge of, myself.  That is what I wished to convey.
