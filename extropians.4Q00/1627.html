<a href="http://www.rocketry.com/mwade/chrono/19664.htm#12470">http://www.rocketry.com/mwade/chrono/19664.htm#12470</a> shows some details
<br>
of four OV (orbiting vehicle) missions all under the &quot;MOL Mockup&quot;
<br>
rubric. So something that could have been called MOL did fly, at least
<br>
four times. OK. I didn't know that.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.rocketry.com/mwade/craft/mol.htm">http://www.rocketry.com/mwade/craft/mol.htm</a> talks about the mockup as
<br>
just a stretched transstage, then goes on to say: 
<br>
<p>&quot;It is possible certain prototype MOL equipment was flown as well.&quot;
<br>
<p>These tests are said to have included some exercises code named
<br>
&quot;Whispering Gallery&quot;, which is said to be the actual reentry test of the
<br>
Gemini Command Module with modified heatshield. Supposedly, it held
<br>
together (fused solid, actually).
<br>
<p>So who knows? &quot;It is possible certain prototype MOL [astronauts were]
<br>
flown as well.&quot;
<br>
<p>Thanks for making me do some legwork, and thanks to Greg for the kewl
<br>
site reminder. I want a Spiral for Newtonmas.

<p>Sure, point taken.
