<br>
<p><em> &gt; damn striped piece of cloth and come home, I suppose.  What is
</em><br>
<p>Why on Earth Mars? You still need zero-volume delta joint vacuum suits
<br>
there, because you still see 98% of the same force as in Earth orbit
<br>
or Moon surface. Water? There's water on the Moon (unless the neutron
<br>
data from Lunar prospector is totally bogus which I don't believe),
<br>
and probably even hydrogen implanted into lunar regolith. In a pinch
<br>
you can always haul some 10 t of the stuff to kickstart a
<br>
colony. Oxygen? Darn Moon is made from some few 10% of that stuff,
<br>
bound in alumosilicates. Lead hydrogen over heated regolith bricks and
<br>
you'll get water. Electrolyze water, and you'll get hydrogen and
<br>
oxygen. Whether Moon or Mars, you have to live underground to escape
<br>
from radiation and prevent rapid decompression due to leaks, and
<br>
vacuum is about the best thermal insulation there is. However, you
<br>
can't do vacuum industrial processes on Mars, because the atmosphere
<br>
is in the way, and insolation density is a bit thin out there. There
<br>
is probably a permanently insolated mountaintop at one of the lunar
<br>
poles, conveniently near the water bound in the cold trap below.
<br>
<p>Manned mars missions before doing the Moon first makes zero sense. It
<br>
only appeals to the scientifically illiterate public which thinks Mars
<br>
is somehow similiar to Earth. It is not. If you screw up there you die
<br>
just as surely as on the Moon. More so in fact, because there is no
<br>
hope for a rescue mission. And you don't even have to go to the Moon
<br>
to work there. You could telecommute there from the living room, at
<br>
the speed of light.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; the point of that?  The first Martians need to stay and work, not
</em><br>
<em> &gt; just explore and poke flags into the red soil.  We can build machines
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that can explore.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Indeed. But why should people stay and work on Mars and not on the
<br>
Moon?
<br>
<p><em> &gt; My notion is a one-way trip, with the idea to set up a farm, build
</em><br>
<em> &gt; habitation modules by guiding and repairing semi-autonomous robots,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; setting up for the next generation, who would actually be born
</em><br>
<em> &gt; native to Mars.  I admit that it is an outrageously high-risk venture.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It is rather a very expensive suicide mission.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt; Really, this would apply to many different types of disabilities.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Right-o!
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Honestly, which disabilities would give you an advantage? I understand
<br>
that weighing just 25 kg can give you advantage for long spaceflights
<br>
without a closed-circuit ecology -- if you can survive the launch and
<br>
reentry -- but what else?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; &gt; Microgravity could be the next great equalizer.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Right-o!
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Have you seen what happens to people and animals after one year of
<br>
microgravity? Higher organisms are not made for space. They need
<br>
simulated gravity thus negating all advantages disabled people might
<br>
possibly have.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt; Is there an untapped extropic reserve among the worlds &quot;dis&quot;abled?
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; There is.  Such a mission would lend new meaning to the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; euphamism &quot;differently abled.&quot;  The differently abled are
</em><br>
<em> &gt; pre-adapted to the confines of a Mars hab module.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I see the disabled playing cyborg first, but little else.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Or how about obsessive compulsive &quot;disorder.&quot;  If the person obsesses
</em><br>
<em> &gt; about surviving in an unforgiving environment, that condition would come
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to be called obsessive compulsive order.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Yes, space is rather unforgiving. The less reason to go galumphing
<br>
about in a space suit, and use teleoperated machinery instead.
