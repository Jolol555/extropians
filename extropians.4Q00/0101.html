</em><br>
<p>Perhaps there should be one.

<p><em> &gt; this, since your wishes for temporary relinquishment will not come to pass
</em><br>
<em> &gt; (at least in the AI area) IMO. Or are you planning to start your own org
</em><br>
<p>I agree this was a bit too verbose, but at least for me the debate was 
<br>
fruitful. The logics of it all drove me to adopt a position I formerly 
<br>
wouldn't dream to hold. Strange, strange world.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; politicking for these measures and controls?
</em><br>
<p>No, I'm more interested in nanotechnology, specifically molecular
<br>
circuitry. I'm no good at politics, and I don't see the threat to
<br>
become relevant before two to three decades have passed. If my mental
<br>
facilities are then still sufficient, we will see then.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, I would ask of you and Eliezer to reevaluate your project,
<br>
specifically reassessing that what you're trying to build is indeed
<br>
that what you will wind up with, especially if you decide to use
<br>
evolutionary algorithms as part of the seed technology.
