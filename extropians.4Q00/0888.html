<p>
Having been pressured by someone else on this list to pressure my
<br>
relatives into buying the ultimate life insurance of cryo (I intend to
<br>
get it for myself, but they do not and will not, so the only result of
<br>
pressuring them would be to damage my relationships with them), I asked
<br>
myself why so many of our friends and loved ones will not spare us the
<br>
pain of knowing that some day, well within our own extended lifetimes,
<br>
they will be gone forever.
<br>
<p>The answer, I think, or at least part of it, is that a commitment to
<br>
immortality - or a commitment to eventual permanent death - commonly
<br>
defines part of who and what a person is.  I think I can safely assume
<br>
that everyone on this list can easily see themselves being a hundred, a
<br>
thousand, even a billion (or insert whatever big number) years old and
<br>
still enjoying life, in whatever form has been obtained at that time.
<br>
But such is not the case for everyone.  Many people see themselves at
<br>
seventy/eighty/whatever and having done everything they want to do,
<br>
growing bored and tired of life.  We embrace the infinite, they embrace
<br>
the finite, and both sides define their dreams and aspirations around
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>Unlike the infamous frog in slowly boiling water, there is no gradation
<br>
from finite to infinite; even the cocept causes immense future shock.
<br>
Some individuals can adjust themselves from one to the other, and the
<br>
chances of doing so are greater with greater realization that the
<br>
necessary technology - including social technology of mindsets and so
<br>
forth, to keep coming up with new things to do - is available, but to
<br>
force the issue is to ask someone to reject that person's own sense of
<br>
self...so no wonder it is so vigorously and emotionally resisted.
<br>
<p>This is ironic if true.  With all the power that shall be available to
<br>
us, the one thing we might desire most - to bring the rest of humanity
<br>
along with us - might be one of the few things that remains impossible
<br>
even for us.
<br>
<p>Which leads to a disturbing thought.  What if the Singularity arrives,
<br>
but the only people who can take advantage of it are those who want to
<br>
take advantage of it...and, given the extreme rate of change this
<br>
entails, only a small fraction of the human race is comfortable making
<br>
this change?  The best and brightest, who might otherwise lead the norms
<br>
into a new era, will - out of pure self-interest if nothing else - join
<br>
us, leaving the masses ignorant, confused, and mostly stagnant.
<br>
<p>Previous radical advances, for instance the Industrial Revolution, were
<br>
one-off advances, or at least a finite series of major changes, and thus
<br>
could be gradually adopted.  The Singularity promises an eternal state
<br>
of flux; one either embraces eternal upgrades and intellectual
<br>
expansion, or stays at whatever level one happens to be at and watches
<br>
those who made the other choice go beyond comprehension.
<br>
<p>I doubt that everyone would leave the relative luddites to their own
<br>
devices.  Some would seek to exploit them like beasts, while others
<br>
would seek to help those who refuse help; neither option seems to
<br>
promise effective aid.
<br>
<p>Or is this even a matter of concern?  For our sakes and theirs, should
<br>
most of us look back on them as no more interesting than the fragments
<br>
of the eggshell from which we emerged?  Intellectually, this would seem
<br>
to be the safest approach, but instinct and a reading of history say
<br>
that, whenever there emerges a power discrepancy of that magnitude
<br>
between the elite and the common, the common act to balance that
<br>
discrepancy, with negative consequences for the elite.
<br>
<p>All of this, though, does lead to an observation of use right now: when
<br>
trying to get support for your ideas, don't ask people to change just to
<br>
suit your own desires.  The personal decisions of others are personal,
<br>
and based on their own values - even if they are insane when judged by
<br>
your values.  Know what is flexible about someone, or at least what is
<br>
usually flexible about most people, before trying to bend it - and a
<br>
desire for or against immortality (including cryo) is rarely flexible.
