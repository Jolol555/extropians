</em><br>
<p>Very well put, Nicq.  The desire for continuance is one of those self fulfilling
<br>
prophecies I like to throw in the creative tautology bag.  The illusion that
<br>
some point in time is a preferred frame is very strong, and gives us the
<br>
impression that existence in the &quot;past&quot; is devalued.  Yet, there is no means to
<br>
break symmetry and produce a preferred frame.  If someone argues that &quot;now&quot; is
<br>
that frame, just wait a few minutes and ask them if they still agree with the
<br>
person they were those few minutes ago making that statement.
<br>
<p>The separation or localization of identity is the other strong illusion.  I may
<br>
be one place/time where the Universe &quot;sticks out&quot; and you another, but I get the
<br>
impression you have also had a peek past the illusion.
