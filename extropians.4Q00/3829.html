<em>&gt;I could do some research, but off the top of my head there was a case

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't being verbally insulting to a 
<br>
police officer going to get you some kind of verbal assault charge 
<br>
anyway, in most places?  The hate crime part is just an add-on for 
<br>
discrimination aggravated circumstances, right?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The woman insisted she
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never used such language when sober and did not conciously intend to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that epithet. Given that drugs like alcohol act to suppress the ego and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;allow the id more liberties (i.e. reduces inhibitions) this is as close
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Please please please don't in any remotely conceivable way imply that 
<br>
people should have less responsibility for their actions after 
<br>
they've *voluntarily* surrendered their rationality to mind-altering 
<br>
substances.
<br>
<p>The increasingly staunch Libertarian in me wants to be allowed to do 
<br>
with my own body whatever I choose.  I'll never be given that freedom 
<br>
if others assume that I won't expect to be held responsible if I 
<br>
abuse that freedom.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Its tantamount to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;putting a right wing republican under the influence of sodium pentathol
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and asking them if they'd like to off Pres. Clinton if given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opportunity, then charging them with violation of federal law.
</em><br>
<p>Forcibly taking away someone's rationality and then punishing them 
<br>
for breaking the law under that coercion is light years away from 
<br>
&quot;tantamount&quot; to the situation you described previously.
