</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Function, not form is important.  Cosmetics are irrelevant.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It just so happens that one of the much maligned &quot;assault weapons&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the M16/AR15, is one of the most intrinsically accurate rifle designs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ever produced.  Go to a rifle shooting match some time, look
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around, and tell me what you see.  When it was first introduced (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the '60s) a military rack M16 shooting standard ball was as accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as most &quot;precision&quot; weapons of the time. To this day, it is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;highly favored by precision and competition shooters, and has largely

</em><br>
<em>&gt;600 meters.  Grandpa's lever-action will never be able to do 1/2&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;groups at 200 meters, but this &quot;assault weapon&quot; can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People who actually know guns appreciate many of the so-called
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;assault weapons&quot; for their own strengths, not because they look
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;evil&quot;.  An SKS is a tough and reliable shooter that is popular for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hunting because it holds up well to field use (quite popular with boar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hunters in particular, probably for that quick follow-up). The AR15 is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the gold-standard for ergonomic design and its extreme precision makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it popular for target shooters and varmint hunters. These are all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clearly reasonable civilian uses for which the weapons are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particularly well-suited.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As for bayonet lugs, when was the last time anyone was murdered with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bayonet (outside government sponsored action, of course)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Proof that it's purpose is not civilian hunting, unless you wanna sneak up and knife your buck.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;silencers (hint: none)?  Barrel shrouds don't even have a function on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anything a person can carry, other than to look cool. Flash suppressors
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't do anything that has any applicability to criminal use (if you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it does, you don't know what a flash suppressor is for) and falls under the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same category as barrel shrouds. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
They're great for hiding the source location of snipers, especially at night.  So you don't want the herd to know where you're picking them off from?  It's not a (game) hunting attachment.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Folding/collapsible stocks are good for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paratroopers and small statured people that can't use a rifle that has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regular stock because of length-of-pull issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
That's a reasonable civilian use, but a short stock will do the same.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(And I was trying to ignore these gun threads...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is well-intentioned and poorly educated people like yourself Mr.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Dees, that pave the road to hell.  It is too bad you can't see that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but then those people rarely do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
To begin with, I was cut and paste quoting an issue brief on assault weapons from HCI, a fact you obviously missed, even though I clearly stated same.  Your differences are with them.  The URL for the entire brief is at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.handguncontrol.org/facts/ib/assault.asp">http://www.handguncontrol.org/facts/ib/assault.asp</a>
<br>
I remember the old saying.  &quot;One shot, one deer.  Two shots, maybe one deer,  Three shots, no deer.&quot;  I'd like to append this observation: thirty shots, either no deer or a messy pulp, and maybe a dead hunter from stray spray.
<br>
It's also well-propagandized fervent and unquestioning people who pave subterranean roads.  My point was, to start, that the gun show buy without background check and mass-purchase 'private collector' loopholes should be closed.  It is also true, however, that less than 1% of the weapons out there, the assault weapons, were responsible, in 1994, for 17% of the cop killings.  Hunting bluebacks does little for one's freezer.
