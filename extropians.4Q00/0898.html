<p>
Eliezer: I must respectfully demur. The last time you and Robert took
<br>
this line, I took it seriously enough to leave the list until I could
<br>
figure out how I'd respond the next time the issue arose. Here I go:
<br>
<p>Call me pigheaded if you want. I'm not even going to promise to try.
<br>
<p>Speaking only for myself, I will exercise my command of language in the
<br>
way I think best. This is not a matter for debate, though you are free
<br>
to draw any conclusion you like from what you see, as you are free to
<br>
gently remonstrate or virulently excoriate me, as you think
<br>
circumstances warrant. 
<br>
<p>It happens that I spend a great many hours a day in an environment
<br>
(corporate America) that requires me to circumscribe my speech and
<br>
behavior to conform to a hypothetical worst case for what any person
<br>
might consider a &quot;hostile environment&quot;. 
<br>
<p>It chafes me. I do not choose to wear another yoke on my own time. The
<br>
time I spend in composing things to post to this list is my time, not
<br>
yours, and not any young lad's or lass's. &quot;The clock is ticking, Bob,
<br>
and I'm only getting older.&quot;
<br>
<p>I *do* strive to comply with the list rules. I believe I have fallen
<br>
short from time to time, but I'm sure I don't remember anything about
<br>
any PG rating in the subject lines. 
<br>
<p>I am not speaking to offend, nor am I speaking to _not_ offend. 
<br>
<p>If, someday, my choice of content in a subject line causes the kind of
<br>
effect you describe... I guess I'll just have to live with the hope that
<br>
in the long run, having been kicked off the list by a parent will fuel
<br>
more subversive reaction than I could have hoped to. 
<br>
<p>And if (in my personal hypothetical worst case) if the kid responds with
<br>
a despair spiral that leads to suicide or other self-destructive
<br>
behavior? 
<br>
<p>I'll mourn. But I have a hard time taking all the blame for a situation
<br>
that fscked up.
<br>
<p>So: I must respectfully decline to wholeheartedly embrace your
<br>
invitation. I offer no guarantee that I will never write or reply to a
<br>
subject line that goes too far, because I refuse to waste the cycles to
<br>
attempt to model what &quot;too far&quot; might be for any parent anywhere--say
<br>
someplace under Taliban law. Nope, cain't do 'er! Or perhaps &quot;Ich kann
<br>
nicht anders&quot; comes closer. 
<br>
<p>Note that if Max or whoever kicks me off the list, I'll figure I
<br>
probably deserved it. Heck, I kicked myself off the list back in the day
<br>
over violating the G*ns moratorium. 
<br>
<p>Did anyone else? I wouldn't know, I left first. :)

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that keeping the subject lines PG or PG-13 is a reasonable policy for
