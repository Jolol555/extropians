<p>There have been a bunch of physics articles about time machines over the last
<br>
few decades.  They clearly show that time machines are not logically
<br>
impossible, though it is not yet clear whether or not they are physically
<br>
possible with standard physics.  Here's one reference:
<br>
<p>Thorne, S. Kip; Black holes and time warps: Einstein's outrageous legacy;
<br>
Great Britain 1994.
