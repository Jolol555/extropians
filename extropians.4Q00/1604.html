<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Back at cars, all of the above is cute, but fuel cell designs will win soon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, but with air, we can compress the air with nuclear, solar, and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-fossil fuels.
</em><br>
<p>1) Compressed air has poor end to end efficiency when used as an energy
<br>
storage medium (typically less than 20%).  This is due to the heat
<br>
rejected during the compression process being lost.
<br>
<p>2) Methanol, an excellent fuel cell reactant, can be efficiently
<br>
synthesized from CO2 and water via thermal shift reactions which can be
<br>
driven by your non-fossil sources.
<br>
<p>3) Methanol fuel cells have better than carnot efficiency, some in
<br>
excess of 80%.
<br>
<p>4) The usable energy storage density is about 100 times better for
<br>
methanol &amp; fuel cells vs compressed air.
<br>
<p>Four times the end to end efficiency and 100 times the mileage is a
<br>
difficult combination to beat.
