<p>I know I've suggested it to death, but here's yet another take on it...
<br>
<p>To start a new business, you need a plan and some money.  Thanks to the
<br>
availability of investment money (read: venture capital) these days, you
<br>
can get the money (and, increasingly, experienced execs) if you have a
<br>
sufficiently good business plan.
<br>
<p>It seems rather likely that many things that will lead to the
<br>
Singularity have the ability to generate massive amounts of profits en
<br>
route to the Singularity.  Therefore, it should be possible to create a
<br>
business plan where your business tries to build one of these profitable
<br>
aspects.  Pick the aspect you're most familiar with; that's probably the
<br>
one you can most easily map out a profitable business plan in.
<br>
<p>If you can generate as much hype as the dot coms (as of last year), and
<br>
back it up with substance (the aspect of the Signularity; not that you
<br>
probably want to mention it as such, since all you can control is your
<br>
aspect, therefore it would be - to the VCs - a big risk to plan on the
<br>
Singularity happening), then becoming wealthy should be little problem.
<br>
(It will take much time and effort, granted, but the likelihood of
<br>
reward for a properly executed plan, especially for the execs and
<br>
founders of said plan, is high, no?)
<br>
<p>The point is, take action.  Don't throw away your day job until you have
<br>
to, of course; that way, if it takes longer to get funding for the plan
<br>
(and it may), you're not starving.  But don't stay exactly where you
<br>
are, either.
