Can't

<em>&gt; Sure!  You're 27 years old and you were born in Seattle.  You attended the

<p>&nbsp;Actually, I'm 29 and haven't worked on IE for a couple of years. I work on
<br>
one of the .NET projects now. The location is current though but I even know
<br>
which site you pulled that from. ;-)  There is no hope for my soul as long
<br>
as my stock options in the Evil Empire maintain positive six figure values.
<br>
My soul has been leased to the Borg. But that's ok, I like my work.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I'm not going to get weirded out about these things. I've been on the
<br>
Internet since the fun days when we hacked into the Engineering modem pool
<br>
in the late 80's to get telnet access. I've got data about myself spewed out
<br>
all over the place for the last 10 years, much of it probably horribly
<br>
embarassing in hindsight but what the hell, you never know. I still find
<br>
posts of mine from my undergrad days in Anthropology and when I moderated a
<br>
couple of soc.religion newsgroups.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I already know my chance at a political career is ruined. ;-)  Other people
<br>
might get a bit more freaked when you start pulling personal data about them
<br>
and posting it together. It can seem quite freaky and scary. People have
<br>
weird ideas that everything on the net disappears after you post it. Nothing
<br>
disappears though it often gets quite worn and stale.
