This debate - about whether I would attain immortality by creating an 
<br>
atom-by-atom replica of myself, gets right to the heart of consciousness. I 
<br>
know that I am a different person, however slightly, in matter and cognitive 
<br>
organization, then I was 5 minutes ago - and much more then I was 10 years 
<br>
ago. I know that I &quot;break continuity&quot; every night when I sleep. As far as I 
<br>
know, I was created anew with implanted memories this morning. But, I know 
<br>
that if I were to create a replica of myself for the purposes of 
<br>
immortality, I would feel absolutely no satisfaction when I finished 
<br>
creating it. I would not feel like I could go jump in front of a truck now 
<br>
while my replica continues my life. To think this way is like people who 
<br>
think they are attaining some kind of immortality through their work, or 
<br>
through having children. They're only concerned with what they leave behind 
<br>
for the world, and not whether they themselves continue to exist.
<br>
I had a dream about this a few years ago, we were all creating replicas of 
<br>
ourselves and eating the originals for food. The originals were fine with 
<br>
the cannibalism because they felt immortal. My parents were trying to get me 
<br>
to partake in the cannibalism but I didn't feel right about it.
