</em><br>
<em>&gt; Schopenhaur pointed out that taking one's own life is the ultimate act of

</em><br>
<p>Since it subverts one's very existence, I guess I can't argue with
<br>
that!  Sort of difficult to enjoy one's subversion and glory in it
<br>
afterward though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Life extension really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't change much of anything except duration- every entity will still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perish at some time. 
</em><br>
<p>Really?  Are you sure?  If that time can be put off and put off over and
<br>
over again and one gets better and better about handling all
<br>
contigencies and having backups of one's self in case of mishap, then
<br>
you get a lot closer over time to &quot;and then you die&quot; not being so.  It
<br>
is not clear that even the heat-death of the universe will necessarily
<br>
end it.  It looks so now, from here, but I will not take bets that we
<br>
will not eventually see even this ultimate trump beat. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So-called &quot;immortalism&quot; just turns the journey towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the inevitable into a length game.  Remember folks, a computerized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness would be vulnerable to EMP pulses, solar flares, gravitational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disturbances, and power outages.  
</em><br>
<p>Passe.  Not difficult to guard against. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A star goes nova and your stuck in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system?  Goodbye.
</em><br>
<p>So as long as accidents are possible you are saying that not dying
<br>
except by such unforeseen and unprepared for accident is simply not a
<br>
good thing?  Or not good enough for you to be particularly interested?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Pass too close to a black hole?  Goodbye again.  War and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strife won't come to an end- even transhumans will have their passions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desires, and reasons for conflict.  
</em><br>
<p>Maybe so, but so what?  Would you rather stay on this size of stage you
<br>
are on now for these few short years followed by oblivion or expand the
<br>
stage and the time, perhaps enough to find real answers to whatever it
<br>
is you seek?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although every major evolutionary step
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (one in which the original entity is combined with others of a similar type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to create a superbeing and thus transcends the original form) results in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased life span, the step never results in immortality.  In the long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run, we're still destined to be eaten by worms or sucked through a wormhole.
</em><br>
<p>Does this somehow comfort you or are you somehow confronting us with
<br>
something you think is for our own good or what?
