<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; &gt; The future of science and technology are not mystical, not magick, not&gt; 
<br>
mysterious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Arthur C. Clarke would disagree with that statement...&lt;&lt;
</em><br>
<p>Where? If it's the line (to paraphrase)about a sufficiently advanced 
<br>
technology being indistinguishable from science -- you should tried reading 
<br>
it more closely. A more primitive civilization would mistake the advanced 
<br>
technology for magic, just like a Bronze Age warrior would think a gun is 
<br>
magic. For the wielders of said technology, it wouldn't be -- they would know 
<br>
exactly how and why it works. The future is mysterious to us because we 
<br>
haven't see it yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Anyway, since when is our destiny of a mundane nature?  This notion has 
</em><br>
only been commonly believed for a very short duration of humanity's existence-
<br>
I'd also argue that this notion is purely transitionary, a kind of collective 
<br>
&quot;dark night of the soul&quot; (as a mystic would put it) before our initiation 
<br>
into the Transhuman existence...&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>During that &quot;short duration,&quot; more human progress has been achieved than in 
<br>
all of previous human history. Apparently, this &quot;dark night&quot; really produces 
<br>
results! I fervently pray (to a non-existent God) that this never ends. 
<br>
Before we started stripping the world from its mystical-religious trappings, 
<br>
we lived huddled in the dark, utterly helpless before the forces of nature. 
<br>
No thanks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A transhuman is not supernatural.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;We don't know this.  I, for one, think that it must be... if this wasn't 
</em><br>
the case, we would certainly be awash in signals from alien civilizations and
<br>
others that still live tied to their mundane existence, eternally expanding, 
<br>
conquering, warring... remember, there were numerous second-generation stars 
<br>
that matured billions of years before our own Sun, and odds are that in a 
<br>
self-organizing universe many intelligent races could have developed and 
<br>
eventually reached their own singularity, in which, through technological 
<br>
means, they advanced to a state that is beyond our comprehension, and could 
<br>
only be seen as divine.  The only way we could even hope to perceive aslight 
<br>
bit of the nature of such beings is through mystical means.  Even the
<br>
ever hard-nosed Carl Sagan proposed something to this effect in &quot;Contact&quot;, 
<br>
when he mentioned the idea of a species that had reached a state beyond our 
<br>
imagination designing patterns in the physical universe that could only be 
<br>
read through mathematical codes... maybe the Kabbalists are on to 
<br>
something...&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Please. The only way for us to get to understand such a species is for us to 
<br>
*raise ourselves to that level.* If we have to approach them (assuming the 
<br>
exist) as ignorant, trembling supplicants, we deserve whatever we get. When 
<br>
Commodore Perry sailed into Japan with a mighty warship, the Japanese could 
<br>
have just fallen to their knees and worshipped him. Instead, in a few 
<br>
generations they had warships of their own. Mystics simply believe their 
<br>
powers of reasoning are incapable of understanding the universe, and that 
<br>
only some esoteric means will do it. So far, science keeps kicking them out 
<br>
of more and more realms of nature, as our observation tools and methods, and 
<br>
our understanding of the universe, continues to grow. The track record of the 
<br>
mystics and religionists, to put it kindly, sucks. None of their predictions 
<br>
has ever come true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Capital 'P' Powers are not amazing or incredible, they are merely currently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inscrutable.
</em><br>
<p>If they're inscrutable, they very well could be amazing and incredible.  You 
<br>
don't know this- nor do I.&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Having, in the past, found that events and phenomena that were previously 
<br>
inscrutable (how did the sun burn, for example) have been logically and 
<br>
falsifiably explained, one can logically infer that what is now inscrutable 
<br>
will also, eventually, be logically and falsifiably explained. To believe 
<br>
otherwise is to deny four centuries of human progress. Now, it is possible 
<br>
that at some point we might run into a wall that science and reason cannot 
<br>
knock down -- but if one must have faith in something, I thing faith in 
<br>
science and reason is more sensible -- they have delivered a great deal more 
<br>
than the alternatives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mystics read fantasy, extropians read science fiction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Get it?
</em><br>
<p>I read both.  My favorite genera, in fact, is Science Fantasy- Star Wars, 
<br>
Shadowrun, the more recent Final Fantasy games, and several of my own strange 
<br>
concoctions.&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Fantasy, in other words. Star Wars is a particular villain of that stripe 
<br>
(nothing wrong with it for entertainment purposes, although I love the 
<br>
deconstructionist articles David Brin wrote about it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I'm one of those strange people who sees no contradiction between being 
</em><br>
mystical and being scientific (and I don't even need some arcane
<br>
interpretation of quantum physics or feel the need to bend the rules of 
<br>
probability to back me up).
<br>
-Nicq&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Human beings have the amazing ability of believing dozens of contradictory 
<br>
things at the same time, and yet remain functionally sane (in fact, that 
<br>
might be a defining aspect of human intelligence -- AI designers take note). 
<br>
Doesn't make them right.
<br>
