<p>So you're not completely hopeless. ;-)

<p><em>&gt; &gt; Respecting people who take astrology seriously does not impress others

<em>&gt; I'd disagree with that- to what end does the individual in question take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astrology seriously?  For what purpose?  What practice?  What do they do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with it?  I would never trust a doctor who made treatment assumptions based

</em><br>
<p>Well, sure, but you can get the same inspiration by pouring different color
<br>
paint in your toilet bowl and pulling the lever. Such is not a matter of
<br>
believing it as valid fact.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Furthermore, please note that the Committee on Un-Extropian Activities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; investigating all participants in this thread for possible connections to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Green Party.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a Liberal Democrat who is going to see Ralph Nader speak this evening, I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Anyone who claims to be a green in any sense ought to be taken out in the
<br>
wilderness and dropped there naked. If they walk out after 6 months, I may begin
<br>
to take them seriously. 99% of them I doubt would make it. When you are freezin
<br>
your butt off, the motto no longer is 'you pack it in, you pack it out', it
<br>
becomes 'fuck it, burn it'. When your processed grain trailmix with exotic dried
<br>
fruits from four different continents runs out and you are reduced to eating
<br>
wild onions, asparagus, and acorns, you'll track down, jump, strangle, gut, cook
<br>
and eat any animal you come across, no questions asked.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I tried, for six months, to embrace Libertarianism.  I just couldn't do it-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm far too compassionate (and I have too little faith in human nature) for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it)
</em><br>
<p>Oddly, the worst atrocities on mankind were committed by people who had too
<br>
little faith in human nature. Trusting someone beyond reason is the only way to
<br>
achieve results beyond hope. Most people tend to live up to the standards you
<br>
expect of them. Think about it.
