<em>&gt; The future of science and technology are not mystical, not magick, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mysterious.
</em><br>
<p>Arthur C. Clarke would disagree with that statement...
<br>
<p>Anyway, since when is our destiny of a mundane nature?  This notion has only
<br>
been commonly believed for a very short duration of humanity's existence-
<br>
I'd also argue that this notion is purely transitionary, a kind of
<br>
collective &quot;dark night of the soul&quot; (as a mystic would put it) before our
<br>
initiation into the Transhuman existence...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A transhuman is not supernatural.
</em><br>
<p>We don't know this.  I, for one, think that it must be... if this wasn't the
<br>
case, we would certainly be awash in signals from alien civilizations and
<br>
others that still live tied to their mundane existence, eternally expanding,
<br>
conquering, warring... remember, there were numerous second-generation stars
<br>
that matured billions of years before our own Sun, and odds are that in a
<br>
self-organizing universe many intelligent races could have developed and
<br>
eventually reached their own singularity, in which, through technological
<br>
means, they advanced to a state that is beyond our comprehension, and could
<br>
only be seen as divine.  The only way we could even hope to perceive a
<br>
slight bit of the nature of such beings is through mystical means.  Even the
<br>
ever hard-nosed Carl Sagan proposed something to this effect in &quot;Contact&quot;,
<br>
when he mentioned the idea of a species that had reached a state beyond our
<br>
imagination designing patterns in the physical universe that could only be
<br>
read through mathematical codes... maybe the Kabbalists are on to
<br>
something...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Capital 'P' Powers are not amazing or incredible, they are merely
</em><br>
currently
<br>
<em>&gt; inscrutable.
</em><br>
<p>If they're inscrutable, they very well could be amazing and incredible.  You
<br>
don't know this- nor do I.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mystics read fantasy, extropians read science fiction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Get it?
</em><br>
<p>I read both.  My favorite genera, in fact, is Science Fantasy- Star Wars,
<br>
Shadowrun, the more recent Final Fantasy games, and several of my own
<br>
strange concoctions.
<br>
<p>I'm one of those strange people who sees no contradiction between being
<br>
mystical and being scientific (and I don't even need some arcane
<br>
interpretation of quantum physics or feel the need to bend the rules of
<br>
probability to back me up).
<br>
