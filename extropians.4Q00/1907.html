In response to the topic:
<br>
<p>The analogy I often used when discussing these types of issues
<br>
is this:  Why would I want someone coming to my home and piss
<br>
all over my carpet, gossip about my friends, steal from my studio,
<br>
or poison my food?  Why should I, or anyone, want to reside in
<br>
a community where there is little, if any, protection for a person’s
<br>
well being other than his/her solid reputations, forthright communications
<br>
or pleasant dispositions.  These lovely qualities are beneficial
<br>
to our individual well being, but cannot hold at bay the reckless
<br>
offenses of others.
<br>
<p>Why should anyone on a private list that is provided as a public
<br>
viewing and communication center be subject to defamatory statements?
<br>
&nbsp;Why should such a recipient of abusiveness have no way of tracking
<br>
the spoiler?  We leave ourselves wide open – exposed to anyone
<br>
at anytime coming onto this list and attacking anyone for any
<br>
reason.
<br>
<p>So, the answer here is list rules, which we already have.  However,
<br>
someone can (and does) slip on for an hour – a day – a week -
<br>
and produces noxious blather and than run away like a coward,
<br>
hiding behind a fictitious name and false identity.
<br>
<p>How would you or anyone feel (or think) if someone who claims
<br>
to be substantial said that he or she knew you or anyone abuses
<br>
a child, embezzled $10,000 from an employer, or lied about credentials?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>I know that that the above seems ridiculously irregular, but
<br>
what if someone else on the list, perhaps someone who you or
<br>
anyone respected highly but had not met yet, read this defamation
<br>
of your or someone else’s character.  
<br>
<p>Surely, I understand that this can and does happen in any environment
<br>
and our reputations should and do speak for themselves.  However,
<br>
the reality is that people are emotional beings and respond to
<br>
the poison in the well often times more often than a calm headed
<br>
reply of &quot;No that is not true.&quot;  No matter how many people might
<br>
stand up and defend you, there is still that inkling of doubt
<br>
planted by the seed of the spoiler - be she or he a greenpeace
<br>
activist, a religious zealot, a anti-transhumanist, or even just
<br>
a person who simply doesn't like someone else and tries to publicly
<br>
damage him or her.
<br>
<p>With all this said, and please forgive my verbosity, there needs
<br>
to be some sort of way that those who administer the ExI list
<br>
can safeguard those who productively participate on the list
<br>
without ulterior motivations.
<br>
<p>I wish this sort of subhuman behavior did not exist in our culture,
<br>
but it does and I would rather work with it and understand it,
<br>
contemplate how to deal withit than let other people suffer the
<br>
consequences of any hurt or pain that accompanies such unnecessary
<br>
abusive behavior.
<br>
