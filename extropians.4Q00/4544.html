Lucky science isn't grounded in philosophy, or we'd all be up the creek.

<em>&gt; &gt;      Thesius's ship should be preserved, since it is a peice of Greek
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; history. They keep it docked, but it starts to decay. Every time a peice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wood decays even a bit, it is replaced with a freh board. Eventually,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; board has been replaced. Is it still Thesius's ship? If no, at what
</em><br>
point
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was it no longer that ship? When did it lose it's &quot;Thesius's ship&quot;-ness?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is still Thesius' ship. If you want to know how, observe the workers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replacing the decayed boards with fresh boards. If you want to know when
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; where, pay attention to these details. If you want to know whose ship it
</em><br>
is,
<br>
<em>&gt; find Thesius' descendents and heirs. If you want to know why, you're a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosopher, and Thesius probably wouldn't want you on the ship.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Furthermore, a scrap dealer stumbles upon all the semi-rotting wood
</em><br>
which
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has been removed from Thesius's ship. He takes it, and, since it's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; completely rotten, he actually assembles a ship from it, he has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-assmbled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Thesius's original ship. He docks it next to the first ship. Which one
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really Thesius's ship?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you were paying attention to the how, and where, and when, and whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relating to Thesius' ship, then you'd know that Thesius (or his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preservationist descendents, if he's dead) still has his reconstructed
</em><br>
ship,
<br>
<em>&gt; and that the scrap dealer has the rotten original ship. No mystery there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; None of this requires philosophy. It just needs observation, direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience to verify facts, and empirical evidence to ascertain correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Someone came to give a philosophy talk at the college I went to and
</em><br>
argued
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they both are, and that this teaches us something about objects and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; space. His hypothesis was that this proves that an object can be in two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; places at the same time. Amazing! Thesius's ship was in two places at
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same time, docked right next to eachother.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That helps to explain why some people call it &quot;fool-osophy.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The reason this peice of philosophy is valuable is because it takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sense&quot; hidden assumptions about the nature of objects and applies it to
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem, which leads to a nonsensical result and shows that the common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assumptions about objects, the premises by which most people think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; objects, are false. If you're a good philosopher, you're going to figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why these wrong questions are the wrong questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nice try, but no kewpie doll. This piece of sh...  excuse me, this piece
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; philosophy is worthless because it pretends to offer solutions, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (un)common sense reveals more valuable information. The advantage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (un)common sense (sense is really not that common) is that it doesn't lead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to nonsensical results. When you come to your senses (stop
</em><br>
philosophizing),
<br>
<em>&gt; things look much more clear. If you're a good philosopher, you'll keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asking the wrong questions to insure that you don't run out of work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To me, science is the most uncommon kind of sense. Especially 21st century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science, because it requires the greatest precision and accuracy in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empirical experiments that humans have ever attempted. I mean, super
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colliders and space telescopes are fairly uncommon. You need hardware to
</em><br>
do
<br>
<em>&gt; science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This reminds me of an Edelman story. Apparently the science department was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in trouble because it had such a huge expense account. The math department
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bragged that it only needed chalk, paper, and a few waste paper baskets.
</em><br>
But
<br>
<em>&gt; the philosophy department did even better. They didn't even need waste
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baskets. Get it? The philosophers didn't throw out their wrong questions.
</em><br>
