<p>
Today's the big day, here in the US - as we so arrogantly assert, we hold the
<br>
determination of the future leader of the free world in our hands.  Nothing 
<br>
like letting that statement roll around n your head, wondering just what
<br>
our European and Japanese colleagues must think.  But that's a digression.
<br>
<p>Things are good.  We are better off in most all general indicators than we 
<br>
were 8 years ago, and a lo tbetter off than we were 20 years ago.  The 
<br>
concerns about &quot;widows, vets, and orphans&quot; were shelved by Social Security 
<br>
and the Great Society, while our concerns abotu &quot;welfare mothers&quot; were 
<br>
shelved with the &quot;Contract On America&quot;.  Crime is down; wealth is up.
<br>
It's a good morning in America - and now we're looking toward the day.
<br>
<p>The stealth issue of this election is, unfortunately, futurism in all its
<br>
various forms.  No one's really talking about it save in the sense of the
<br>
impending doom of the Baby Nuke - Social Security in 2010 and beyond, and
<br>
this is where I think the entire electorate, especially those of us with a 
<br>
more forward outlook, are suffering.  The future is a place of fear and 
<br>
loathing, not of promise and potential.
<br>
<p>While too late to do this election, I would propose the following as the
<br>
foundation of a &quot;Futurist's Voter's Guide&quot;, so that at the very least these
<br>
issues are on the table.
<br>
<p>The proposal is this:  How do the candidates answer the following questions:
<br>
<p>1) What is your vision of America's place in space in 20 years, particularly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the civilian sector?
<br>
<p>2) If you had to choose one of the following to come true during your 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;administration, what would it be and why?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) A breakthrogh in life extension technology adding at least 50% to the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lifespan of the average American (to 120 years old)?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The establishment of the first permanent civilian habitation in space?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) The ability to replace failing organs with new ones grown from a culture
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of that person's own cells?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) A zero-emissions transportation network that costs about as much as the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;average family car today, per person?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) The ability to cure all genetic diseases through use of genetic 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engineering technology?
<br>
<p>3) In your opinion, what was the most significant scientific achievement
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since 1950, and the impact it has had on you personally, on the nation,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on the world as a whole.
<br>
<p>4) Based on your answer to number 3, what technology could you imagine that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would have as far-reaching effect, if not moreso, and what you would do
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to make it a reality.
<br>
<p>5) Longevity has been increasing at a surprising rate - 50% over the 20th 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;century, and is increasing at a growing rate.  Fundamentally, what it means
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to grow old in the modern world is changing dramatically.  What policies 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would you enact/rescind/modify to deal with this growing change in 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;social demographics and its corresponding effects on all our lives?
<br>
<p>6) Suppose that sometime during your presidency, proof positive was shown 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we had created a truly artificial intelligence.  How would you handle
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the questions that spring from this breakthrough, including such issues as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;citizenship and &quot;human rights&quot; questions, as well as the ethics of dealing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with this sort of a being.
<br>
<p>&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;
<br>
<p>While this is in no way exhaustive, it is an attempt to offer a starting
<br>
point.  The goal is to assess the candidate's positions on futurist 
<br>
causes, and not their adherence to a particular political or social 
<br>
ideology; their party affiliation should tell more about that than this 
<br>
questionaire should ask.
<br>
<p>Any additions of quesions, etc.?  Maybe by the time of the next major 
<br>
elections in the US (two years hence - senate and all house races), this 
<br>
questionaire can help us get a better view of how these people will pursue 
<br>
the policies we hold dear.
