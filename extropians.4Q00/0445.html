<p>Dear Barbara,
<br>
<p>In the public schools that I attended in Hawaii, in the later 60s and
<br>
early 70s, there was one day out of every year called: &quot;Kill Haole
<br>
Day&quot;. &quot;Haole&quot; means &quot;white&quot; or &quot;caucasian&quot; in Hawaiian. This was a day
<br>
in many high schools where haoles were &quot;officially&quot; beat up and in
<br>
some cases killed (so I'm told, although I never saw that because I
<br>
was in elementary and intermediate school). The teachers couldn't do
<br>
very much about it, and I would not be surprised if some of them
<br>
didn't actually support it in some way.
<br>
<p>The Hawaiian Tourist Board would like to have promoted Hawaii as a
<br>
&quot;paradise of mixed cultures&quot;, a &quot;wonderful melting pot&quot; but a child
<br>
growing up there didn't experience that, nor was the pot of ethnic
<br>
cultures melted very well. The Hawaiians hated the Samoans, the Chinese
<br>
hated the Japanese, the Portugese hated the Fijians, the Tahitians hated
<br>
the Taiwanis, etc etc. (I'm sure that I have the different hatreds
<br>
mixed up, the main point is that most of the different ethnic groups
<br>
hated *at least* one other ethnic group, and actively expressed it).
<br>
<p>... and they *all* hated the haoles. Hence, &quot;Kill Haole Day&quot;.
<br>
<p>If that you are a fair-haired, blue-eyed, fair-skin person: try body
<br>
surfing on a local, non-tourist beach on any Hawaiian island, say
<br>
Waimanalo or Waimea on Oahu, and notice how the locals treat you.
<br>
That will give you a small taste of the prejudices there.
<br>
<p>My younger sister and I managed in time to blend our haole skin into the
<br>
environment with some sunshine and our brown hair color, but our
<br>
older sister with blonde hair and more fair skin had a much harder time.
<br>
<p>During the other times of the year, the prejudice was simply all
<br>
around. During one school year my sisters and I were the only haoles
<br>
in the school, and even the teachers were antagonistic against us.
<br>
We faced some ridicule, by simple fact of our skin color.
<br>
I didn't encounter that attitude again for another 25 years .. in
<br>
science ..(and then it was because I was/am a woman).
<br>
<p>Prejudicious attitudes are powerful emotional motivators. I am curious
<br>
about how such an attitude can arise (surely it is fear-based.) I
<br>
don't see how people can live a peaceful daily life with that deep,
<br>
irrational, hatred inside of them.
