<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;Yep.  Because he believes that Libertarian aims can be more effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;achieved by improving the system - which requires working within it, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;thus working with The Powers That Be - than the current ideal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;destroying the system and starting over (which is presumably what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;L candidates he voted against were promoting).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  He never explicitly mentioned voting &quot;against&quot; Libertarians.  He said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  that he voted &quot;for&quot; Democrats.  Whether that means that he wanted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  vote for possible winners in a major party or he wanted to vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  against a revolutionary LP candidate is unknowable from this piece -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  I find support for both positions.  They both seem equally likely so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  taking one side or the other would be special pleading.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Technically, under most of the American political system (which, to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;knowledge, is what Mr. Brin votes in), a vote for one candidate for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;position (where only one person may fill that position) is a vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;against all others.  (I personally would not mind seeing that change,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;but that is the reality for now.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Above, you characterized Mr. Brin's voting for Democrats as being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct vote *against* the LP candidate.  Implying his intent from his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments is not discernable.  Yes, we all know that the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voting system is basically a zero sum game.
</em><br>
<p>Right.  And therefore, a vote for any candidate (say, the Dem's) is a
<br>
vote against all others (say, the Lib's).  That is what I meant.  If it
<br>
were possible to vote for more than one candidate, I would not have
<br>
made that statement, but since it's not...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we're supplementing his argument with speculation, he might have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meant that we can achieve Libertarian goals by also co-opting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Green party.
</em><br>
<p>Not in the same way.  Much as we might wish otherwise, Greens don't have
<br>
nearly the current voter acceptance of the Democrats.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Speculation aside, he said that he votes in general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elections for Democrats.  How he goes from voting consistently for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democrats to achieving Libertarian goals is beyond me.
</em><br>
<p>He never said &quot;consistently&quot;.  In fact, I believe his point was more
<br>
that he does not consistently vote Libertarian, but instead sometimes
<br>
goes Democrat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If he had said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether Republican, Democrat, or independent - vote for the candidate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who both has a chance to win and espouses (and you believe will stick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to) the following goals:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Across the board reduction of taxes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Reduction of military expenditures for nation-building exercies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. Increase of individual rights for drug use, euthanasia, sexual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interaction, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. Promotes strict responsibility for and enforcement of property laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5. ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... I might have agreed with his conclusions (although his arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would still have been fallacious and in need of work).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, he didn't really say any of that.
</em><br>
<p>He did, but not very clearly, apparently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Below are portions of Mr. Brin's essay with my comments indicating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fallacious arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------
</em><br>
<p>[snip start of essay]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Moreover, recent advances in anthropology, neuroscience and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;complexity theory all converge toward one conclusion; even the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;compelling or beguiling ideological description can never encompass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the range of emergent and often contradictory qualities contained in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a single human being, let alone whole societies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Straw man: Political ideologies aren't about encompassing all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualities in a human being.  They're more about the goals of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society and how to go about achieving those goals - so learning that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarian principles don't have all mutations of Human DNA in them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does nothing to diminish the validity of their political ideas.
</em><br>
<p>Granted, this one is weak.  He might have done better just to skip right
<br>
to the next section.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;What do I need right now?   Because I'm a brash eccentric, I need a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;society that is open, tolerant, even welcoming of eccentricity. One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;whose institutions are accountable enough to minimize the inevitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;capricious power abuses that fester in every human culture.  One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;where competition takes place under conditions that maximize fair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;comparison of quality (in goods, services, and ideas) while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;minimizing the destructive effects of our most loathsome human trait
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;-- our talent for rationalizing cheating and oppression.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What do I want for tomorrow?  A world where coercion is minimized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and individuals are free to achieve the maximum they can by making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fair deals with each other, leveraging off others' talents and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;benefiting from the mutual criticism that only true freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;engenders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Now I concede -- heck, I avow! -- that these desiderata sound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;awfully libertarian.  But let's recall that, ironically, the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;futurist dream was shared by idealizing Marxists!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm no expert on Marxism, but did the Marxists believe in trading for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things or leveraging talents for any sort of personal gain?  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone needed something, you gave it to them if you could: From each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his ability, to each his need.  Melding Marxism and Libertarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems disingenuous at best.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but see his next paragraph.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;   They, too, envisioned a final destination without states or any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;coercive institutions, only human beings interacting autonomously. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The chief difference was always over the right path to achieve that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;envisioned paradise of emancipated individuals.  Marxists fantasized 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that it would emerge semi-violently from some &quot;final stage of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;industrial capitalization&quot; -- as if that ongoing task could ever be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;finished!  Libertarians, on the other hand, see the ultimate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;apotheosis of individualism coming as a result of...
</em><br>
<p>Compare-and-contrast.  Libertarianism and Marxism have the same goals,
<br>
but seek to achieve it by different means.  Mr. Brin points out an
<br>
apparent fallacy in Marxism's means that prevent it from ever
<br>
achieving its ends.  He uses that to highlight that Libertarianism
<br>
should have achievable means - which is part of the point he makes in
<br>
this essay: the &quot;revolution&quot; methodology is not working, and probably
<br>
can not work, as well as his suggested alternative.

<em>&gt; &gt;and see my &quot;questionnaire on ideology&quot;.

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I encourage you to follow the above links and look at the questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They're so loaded and riddled with false dichotomies that they seem -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me - to be farcical.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, maybe not.  Irrelevant to this article.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Does the commonly held libertarian self-image - as a doctrine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;arising solely from evidence and reason -- really hold?  The answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;may embarrass you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ad Hominem.
</em><br>
<p>Unstated but implied: &quot;...and does embarrass some people similar to
<br>
you.&quot;  That's the meat of this one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;For example, do you want to talk about propaganda? I'll show you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;propaganda! Modern western media messages -- e.g. in nearly every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Hollywood movie -- emphasize in-your-face individualism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;suspicion of authority, pounding these themes more relentlessly than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;any other motif in human history.  Never before has an idea been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;given such play!  So might our libertarian attitudes actually arise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from this everpresent indoctrination?  From lessons we've imbibed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;since childhood, suckling them from the teat of a society that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;much less conformist and more cherishing of individualism than we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;let ourselves imagine?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's a cause and effect problem.  The &quot;in-your-face individualism&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressed in movies could be (and is most likely, IMO) a reflection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of pre-existing human desires, not the cultivation of them.
</em><br>
<p>True, but irrelevant to his point.  He's presenting one possible view,
<br>
setting up for the fact that this view is perceived by others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When I mention this in public, some audience members greet the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;apparent paradox with displeasure, even anger.  It's discomfiting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;imagine that a proudly singular trait might have arisen from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;relentless propaganda!  How much more satisfying to say to yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;-- &quot;I invented individualism and rebellion!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fallacious a priori.  He's proven no paradox.
</em><br>
<p>Nor does he need to.  He's only referencing an &quot;apparent&quot; paradox.
<br>
<p>I think the main problem is that you thought he was pondering on what
<br>
is, while he was really addressing what is perceived as being and how
<br>
that can/should be manipulated to bring about changes in what is.
