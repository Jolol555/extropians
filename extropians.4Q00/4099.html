<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE DECEMBER 15 2000
<br>

<br>

<br>
<p>Mutations to &quot;I'm not dead yet&quot; gene nearly double lifespan in fly
<br>
<p>The December 15 2000 issue of Science reported an exciting experiment that
<br>
confirmed the genetic basis of aging by nearly doubling the average adult
<br>
lifespan of the fruit fly through the insertion of mutations into a single
<br>
gene.  The gene, named Indy, which stands for &quot;I'm not dead yet&quot;,  is
<br>
expressed most abundantly in sites of intermediary metabolism in the fly.
<br>
The gene product most closely related in mammals are membrane proteins
<br>
that transports Krebs cycle intermediates, known as dicarboxylate
<br>
transporters, found in the liver, colon, small intestine, placenta, kidney
<br>
and brain.    As calorie restriction most likely confers its well known
<br>
life extension benefit through metabolic effects,  this genetic mutation
<br>
may mimic calorie restriction through the metabolic state it creates.  So
<br>
far, only one other life extending mutation has been accomplished in the
<br>
fruit fly, and that is the loss of function to the Methusaleh gene which
<br>
extends lifespan by 35%, but whose gene product and  location in tissue is
<br>
unknown.
<br>
<p>The mutant flies were kept in a environment that was
<br>
temperature-controlled to 25 degrees C.  At this temperature, 45% achieved
<br>
1% maximum lifespan extension.  Maximum lifespan is the longest observed
<br>
lifespan for a species, contrasted with mean, or average lifespan.  When
<br>
another group of flies with the same mutations were kept in environments
<br>
in which the temperature was 18 degrees, nearly all experienced the
<br>
increase in mean lifespan that was observed in nearly 50% of the flies
<br>
kept at 25 degrees, and nearly half  were able to live 1% longer than the
<br>
maximum lifespan for the species.  A total of 5,430 mutant flies were used
<br>
in this study.  Flies in whom the genetic insertion was removed reverted
<br>
back to a normal lifespan.
<br>
<p>The females of the mutated lines retained their fertility 40% longer than
<br>
the control flies who did not receive the mutations.  This extension of
<br>
the period of fertility occurred without a delay of the onset of
<br>
fertility.
<br>
<p>The study authors conclude that a reduction in the amount or efficiency of
<br>
a dicarboxylic cotransporter in the mutant flies could be creating a state
<br>
similar to calorie restriction, and that further investigation may lead to
<br>
genetic and pharmacologic interventions for lifespan extension.
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Prevention
<br>
<p>Don't count on the new media or popular health publications to keep you
<br>
fully informed about new medical findings. An article published in the
<br>
December 25, 1996, issue of the Journal of the American Medical
<br>
Association (JAMA) showed that 200 mcg of supplemental selenium a day
<br>
reduced overall cancer mortality by 50% in humans compared to a placebo
<br>
group not receiving supplemental selenium. This 9-year study, published in
<br>
the American Medical Association's scientific journal (JAMA), demonstrated
<br>
that a low-cost mineral supplement could cut the risk of dying from cancer
<br>
in half.
<br>
<p>In the prior week's issue of JAMA (December 18, 1996), an article was
<br>
published indicating that folic acid could substantially reduce
<br>
cardiovascular disease risk. The selenium cancer study received some media
<br>
attention, but the folic acid cardiovascular study did not. The fact is
<br>
that the news media have not been consistent in reporting on studies that
<br>
substantiate the disease-preventing role of dietary supplements, even when
<br>
these studies appear in the most prestigious medical journals in the world.
<br>
<p>One of the most compelling reports that high-potency supplements extend
<br>
lifespan in humans was published in the August 1996 issue of the American
<br>
Journal of Clinical Nutrition. This study involved 11,178 elderly people,
<br>
who participated in a trial to establish the effects of vitamin
<br>
supplements on mortality. This study showed that the use of vitamin E
<br>
reduced the risk of death from all causes by 34%. Effects were strongest
<br>
for coronary artery disease, where vitamin E resulted in a 63% reduction
<br>
in death from heart attack. In addition, the use of vitamin E resulted in
<br>
a 59% reduction in cancer mortality. When the effects of vitamin C and E
<br>
were combined, overall mortality was reduced by 42% (compared to 34% for
<br>
vitamin E alone). These results are the most significant evidence yet
<br>
presented about the value of vitamin supplementation, yet the media failed
<br>
to report on it.
<br>
<p>If you are healthy now, and want to stay that way, the Life Extension
<br>
Foundation has designed protocols that incorporate the best-documented
<br>
disease-preventing nutrients and hormones.

<br>
TMG tablets
<br>
<p>TMG's unique biological effect makes it a critical component of a
<br>
disease-prevention program: it is the most effective facilitator known of
<br>
youthful methylation metabolism. Published research shows that methylation
<br>
is related to a variety of diseases, including cardiovascular disease,
<br>
cancer, liver disease, and neurological disorders. Enhancing methylation
<br>
improves health and slows premature and, perhaps, normal aging. The
<br>
research shows three specific benefits:
<br>
<p>Methylation lowers dangerous homocysteine levels, thus lowering the risk
<br>
of heart disease and stroke.
<br>
<p>Methylation produces SAMe, which may have potent antiaging effects and has
<br>
been shown to alleviate depression, remyelinate nerve cells, improve
<br>
patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and protect against
<br>
alcohol-induced liver injury.
<br>
<p>Methylation protects DNA, which may slow cellular aging.
<br>
<p>TMG should be taken with cofactors vitamin B12 and folic acid. If you take
<br>
the Life Extension Mix and the Life Extension Booster, you will get these
<br>
cofactors.

<p>Getting older is a challenge, but it is the diseases of aging that people
<br>
fear most. Modern medicine has done little to prevent the underlying
<br>
disorders that accelerate the aging process and bring about the
<br>
vulnerability, pain and suffering that we connect with growing old.
<br>
<p>Newly identified mechanisms of aging have shed light on natural therapies
<br>
that may counteract biochemical changes that result in degenerative
<br>
disease. The following is a summary of these new findings:
<br>
<p>Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) is a dangerous chemical messenger that
<br>
incites the immune system to attack healthy tissues throughout the body.
<br>
Elevated TNF-a causes systemic inflammatory cascade that may result in
<br>
painful arthritis along with lethal neurological or vascular
<br>
complications. Increases in TNF-a play a role in the catabolic wasting
<br>
effect seen in cancer and pathological aging. Nettle leaf extract has
<br>
shown a potent inhibitory affect against TNF-a.
<br>
<p>Scientists have developed a better molecular understanding as to how
<br>
carnitine and lipoic acid promote youthful cellular levels of glutathione,
<br>
sustain mitochondrial energy production and protect against immune
<br>
dysfunction. Acetyl-L-carnitine and alpha lipoic acid are popular
<br>
supplements Foundation members take to maintain healthy cellular function
<br>
throughout the body.
<br>
<p>The process of glycation is a fundamental cause of many aging-related
<br>
diseases including the neurologic, vascular and eye disorders so common in
<br>
the elderly. In fact, glycation is a major factor in aging itself.
<br>
Carnosine specifically interferes with the glycation process.
<br>
<p>Immune impairment makes aging humans vulnerable to infectious disease and
<br>
cancer. A well-designed study found that seniors taking zinc and selenium
<br>
had significantly fewer infections over a two year period, but that
<br>
vitamin supplementation alone did not have a major effect. In this study,
<br>
the zinc and selenium supplement cut the number of infections by nearly
<br>
two thirds compared to placebo.
<br>
<p>Based on the accumulating body of research showing specific mechanisms by
<br>
which the diseases of aging can be prevented, The Life Extension Buyers
<br>
Club has formulated a product called ChronoForte that provides the
<br>
following in six capsules daily:
<br>
<p>Acetyl-L-carnitine HCl 2000 mg
<br>
Alpha Lipoic acid 300 mg
<br>
Carnosine 1000 mg
<br>
Nettle leaf extract 1000 mg
<br>
Zinc 15 mg
<br>
Selenium 100 mcg

<p><p>LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE
<br>
&quot;Eat to Live, Don't Live to Eat&quot;, by Brain Manning Delaney
<br>
<p>A breakfast business meeting. Sunday brunch with the kids. Lunch with a
<br>
colleague. Dinner and dancing. A midnight snack. Eating has become a
<br>
pastime and business facilitator, something to do for fun or discuss a
<br>
deal over. It has become so ingrained in our lifestyles that our
<br>
appointments and social gatherings are routinely scheduled around one such
<br>
event. Eating now serves a social, even financial purpose. So much so that
<br>
we have forgotten the reason why we engage in the activity to begin with:
<br>
to live.
<br>
<p>In an age where science is at the frontiers of revolutionary advances, it
<br>
would seem unnecessary to take life extending measures that, on the
<br>
surface, appear to lessen quality of life. Calorie restriction (CR) could
<br>
be so classified, given the extent to which food and eating are an
<br>
integral part of our contemporary lifestyle. But a closer look reveals the
<br>
wisdom of eating to live, and the possible folly of living to eat.
<br>
<p>Giving food consumption its original and sole responsibility back is
<br>
partly what a calorically restricted diet does. Its purpose: life
<br>
extension. In study after study conducted on a variety of laboratory
<br>
animals, CR has been shown to dramatically extend life span. While it may
<br>
prove challenging to break the social barriers that tie us to food, the
<br>
promise of living longer may help us do just that.
