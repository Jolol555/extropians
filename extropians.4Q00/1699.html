</em><br>
<em>&gt;Their basic point seems to be that people prefer present pleasure over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future pleasure, but then when they get to the future, they regret their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;past choices.  I don't think this is as universal as they make it out

</em><br>
<p>The main question is whether this their assumption is true on average, i.e.,
<br>
whether this happens more often than not.  Imagine you can get a 10% annual
<br>
return on your investments.  Then choosing to save $1 more today and invest
<br>
it for ten years is a choice between $1 today and $2.60 ten years in the
<br>
future.  When you invest as much as you want then on the margin you are just
<br>
indifferent between having one more dollar today to spend today, and having
<br>
2.6 more dollars in ten years to spend then.
<br>
<p>Now imagine that you could break causality and give $1 to yourself ten years
<br>
ago to spend then.  How much would you be willing to pay today, and not spend
<br>
today, for this privilege?  If you would be willing to pay $2.60 today, your
<br>
preferences are time-consistent. If you would be willing to pay less than
<br>
$2.60, you fit the assumption made by Caplin &amp; Leahy.  If you would be willing
<br>
to pay more than $2.60, your preferences are time-inconsistent in the opposite
<br>
direction.
<br>
<p>It seems plausible to me that most people would be willing to pay less than
<br>
$2.60 to give their ten year ago self $1.  But it would be nice to have
<br>
clearer data on this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;While this little story does have enough of a germ of truth that we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recognize some elements in our own lives, I think it is not a universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experience for all of our consumption.  It has a childish quality, the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;His inability to learn from his mistakes, while a weakness that we can all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;identify with to some extent, is something that most of us can overcome.
</em><br>
<p>It is fundamentally not an issue of learning.  It is a conflict of preferences.
