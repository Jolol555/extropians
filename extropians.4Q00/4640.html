<p>Actually, not necessarily. This is an area where private law is leading
<br>
the way. The ICBO (International Congress of Building Officials) is a
<br>
international body of building and fire inspectors who convene to
<br>
compile, based on science research, real disasters, etc. revisions to
<br>
the ICBO model building, mechanical, electrical, and fire codes. This
<br>
code is not in itself law, but it is used as a model by which states and
<br>
countries around the world revise and improve their own building codes
<br>
(or institute them in places that did not formerly have them. The ICBO
<br>
has no sovereign authority, but it has acquired such a reputation in its
<br>
field that most states, counties and cities I've come in contact with
<br>
will typically adopt their recommendations outright, or modify them
<br>
slightly depending on local conditions.
