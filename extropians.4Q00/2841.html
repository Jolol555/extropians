Hi Steve.
<br>
<p>Boy, you are a slippery one.
<br>
<p>You're pretty good at &quot;not being wrong,&quot; ain'tcha?
<br>
<p>On:
<br>
<p>----- Original Message -----
<br>
From: &quot;Steve&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:steve@multisell.com?Subject=Re:%20Conscious%20machines&In-Reply-To=&lt;00bc01c054dd$a6758880$d2147318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">steve@multisell.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I think you're reading too much into what I'm saying Steve.  Let's try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;keep this simple.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Assuming that everything is simple is a BIG mistake.
</em><br>
<p>You're right Steve.  So let's not assume that everything is simple.  In
<br>
addition, at the other extreme, let us not practice the deliberate
<br>
obfuscation and/or avoidance of the issues by continual reference to the
<br>
unknowability of all things.  Can we agree that even in the absence of
<br>
purely predictable/deterministic properties, we, as cognizant beings, can
<br>
proceed anyway, and musn't be paralyzed with indecision?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; The Jehovah's Witness' are averse to blood transfusions.  JW Betty
</em><br>
requires
<br>
<em>&gt; a blood transfusion to live.  Facilities exist to undertake the procedure
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; a timely fashion.  In the absence of her ability to remove and/or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;hack-around&quot; (oh, just this one time,) her ideology, she will die.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the Jehova Witness is making a value judgement that some things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come before life &amp; death even, and the emotional attachment to this wish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief in an afterlife wins out. We might think they are wrong and
</em><br>
limited,
<br>
<em>&gt; but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they think the same about your outlook.
</em><br>
<p>Again, yes, there are intangibles, but that's not what I'm talking about.
<br>
Further, I'm not even saying that *I'm* the one who gets to decide what a
<br>
limiting ideology is.
<br>
<p>To be achingly clear:  all you're arguing here is that, for some reason,
<br>
that belief may NOT be limiting in this particular case.  Fine.  If you hold
<br>
that to be the case, then it's a bad example.  The point remains: we should
<br>
try to remove the genuinely limiting ideologies.
<br>
<p>Let me further refine my usage of the term limiting, lest you deliberately
<br>
mis-interpret my intention (whoops, too late.)  The type of ideologies I'm
<br>
talking about removing are the ones that limit the individual from achieving
<br>
'good things.'  (or increased utility, or however you want to define it.)
<br>
You choose to argue the minutiae, &quot;oh no Jason, that's not a limiting
<br>
ideology for this and that such and such reasons.&quot;  Fine.  I agree the
<br>
consequences of actions and ideologies are debatable.  The point remains: IF
<br>
an ideology limits an individual from increasing utility, THEN it should be
<br>
stripped away.
<br>
<p>Read that sentence again, carefully.
<br>
<p>I'm not interested in arguing the IFs with you-- clearly we disagree on that
<br>
point: (JW Betty may be happy with her beliefs, but if her and I are in
<br>
adjacent operating rooms, facing blood transfusions, only one of us is
<br>
walking home tomorrow.  Joe's concern with being seen as someone who is
<br>
always hitting on girls is the limiting insecurity of someone who can't
<br>
approach people on a friendly level without constantly worrying about the
<br>
public perception.  Theo's insistence on drinking poison kool-aid to join
<br>
his alien liberators is a major stumbling block to his apparent goal of
<br>
exploring the universe.)
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;Now, we can debate whether a particular belief structure is limiting or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;advantageous, but if we -agree- that a particular belief structure is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;limiting, wouldn't you also hold that striping away such an ideology is
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;benefit?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not every &quot;belief structure&quot; can be intellectualized as you wish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Empowerment may be more to do with physical energy level than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs ... for example, if I have been drinking at lunchtime or am
</em><br>
sleepy,
<br>
<em>&gt; I just can't be arsed to do much. No beliefs holding me back ...
</em><br>
<p>I'm not talking about -every- belief structure Steve, as the paragraph above
<br>
states in brutal, nay, shocking clarity.  Where do you get these
<br>
counter-arguments from?  Why don't you just answer the question?  I won't
<br>
hold it against you if you say yes.  If fact, it might re-assure me that you
<br>
weren't simply being difficult (whoops, too late.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I do not see your oversimplistic view as having any merit.
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough.  You think things are complicated.  Mostly, they are.
<br>
Situational and environmental modifiers rear their ugly heads.  However, a
<br>
simple core truth remains, and I have personally reaped the benefits from
<br>
understanding it:  Humans often hold arbitrary beliefs that are negatively
<br>
limiting.  Humans should try to identify such beliefs and remove them (so as
<br>
to no longer be arbitrarily limited.)  Your protestations against this
<br>
'oversimplistic view' are argumentative and unhelpful.  The abstractions you
<br>
introduce to this discussion seem designed to preserve your authority over
<br>
the process of human therapy.  You don't need to do that-- I surrender to
<br>
your authority regarding the frequent complexity of procedure.
<br>
<p>-I- however have luckily (and in the absence of expert advice) achieved
<br>
whiz-bang results from the logical observation of my own limiting ideologies
<br>
and the subsequent removal thereof.  Still a work in progress, I am pleased
<br>
to report that my level of personal empowerment is currently quite high.
<br>
I'm actually still quite in a state of amazement regarding the incredibly
<br>
good things that have happened to me in the last two years, wow--
<br>
particularly the last 2 months in fact.  Again, there's no self-help
<br>
literature, no expert psycho-analysis and no12 step plan behind my progress.
<br>
For me, at least, it -was- simple Steve: observation of self, determination
<br>
to optimize.  I would recommend this philosophy to list members if I wasn't
<br>
extremely cognizant of the fact that most have already adopted some version
<br>
of it.  Determine to optimize!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Desirable ends:  Removal of limiting belief structures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My limiting belief is that I am &quot;mortal&quot; and not superman which stops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me leaping from tall buildings ... this limiting belief is ESSENTIAL.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No need to strip anything way, just evaluate your actions/beliefs
</em><br>
sensibly.
<br>
<p>If you *really* think this is what I meant by 'limiting', then I hope I have
<br>
addressed this above.
<br>
<p>But, come on Steve.  Please.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; You -are- looking to re-invent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;yourself as a posthuman entity, aren't you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, have been post-human a very long time already.
</em><br>
<p>What is a human?  What is it about -you- that makes you &quot;not-a-human?&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;  I think we should undertake that goal in a spirit of compassion, as I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stated, but do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;shrink away from the brass ring!  Do not believe yourself unworthy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not a problem I have. I just don't altogether trust everyone else with it
</em><br>
<p>Ah, I see.  You don't trust other people who might empower themselves.  Fair
<br>
enough.  So what's your strategy then?  Is it your intention to prevent
<br>
other individuals from embracing rational self-empowerment?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;The ability to dissolve one's ego is -also- an expression of personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This is a paradox/truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humility ... yes maybe what your Joe character was exhibiting?
</em><br>
<p>Probably that's what he tell himself.  Again --&gt;
<br>
<a href="http://www.wildghost.com/mandela.htm">http://www.wildghost.com/mandela.htm</a>
<br>
More likely its fear-- and the longer that Joe perpetuates this belief
<br>
structure, the less likely that he'll actually sit down and do something:
<br>
write his book, say hello to someone nice.  If he's lucky, he'll get knocked
<br>
out of this negative attractor state by a major situational modifier.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, if Joe is perfectly content to be alone and unpublished
<br>
(which I'll grant may be the case,) then, hey, more power to him.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No, aeons ago our ancestors' behavior was governed by sunlight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &amp; the primal eye, whereas nowadays our E-1 brains have infinite-state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; capability (self-organising) since they are no longer governed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; organic (primal eye) external clock.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Gobbledegook.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm ... obviously you haven't studied solid state physics or neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation,
</em><br>
<p>Obviously.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; sorry if I am so far over your head. I can reference you the papers if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read big words.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not able to read big words, so don't bother.  I'm actually quite slow,
<br>
you know.
<br>
<p>For instance, I'm totally incapable of recognizing how your above paragraph
<br>
invalidates (or even remotely addresses) my statement that: &quot;Environments
<br>
have decreased relevancy to our existence if we don't actually get to
<br>
&quot;mentally interface&quot; with them.&quot;
<br>
<p>In fact, to my painfully addled intellect, your above paragraph appears to
<br>
be an attempt at tangential obfuscation by authority-- and seems to
<br>
demonstrate an unwillingness to agree with (or engage) a relatively
<br>
innocuous statement.
<br>
<p>Perhaps, in deference to my ignorance regarding &quot;E-1 non-primal-eye
<br>
infinite-state self-organizing&quot; brain theory, you could (in detail) explain
<br>
how said terms increase the relevancy of environments that we don't actually
<br>
get to mentally interface with.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It is overzealous evangelisers that cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If their &quot;limiting beliefs&quot; get the Amish or whoever thru
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life .. they aren't complaining ... it is your inflexibility/purism of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that creates the problem here, not the poor Amish.
</em><br>
<p>Dude!  I'm not judging the Amish.  Hey, I say: &quot;Go Amish!&quot;  I -love- the
<br>
Amish!
<br>
<p>But, you'll grant (I hope, dear God, I hope) that if a particular Amish
<br>
wants to, oh... visit Mir for instance, he/she has some ideological hurdles
<br>
to overcome.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We all live in trance!
</em><br>
<p>Well, if we -all- live in trance, then so what?  It's irrelevant if there is
<br>
no such thing as &quot;NOT-trance.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; let me ask you a question ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can use MVT to devise new types of hypnotic induction (mind control).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should I use these techniques to promote my own agenda or not?
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you want to place the agenda of self-empowerment into an ethical
<br>
context (I touched on this briefly with my 'spirit of compassion'
<br>
statements,) then I'll have to state that I am pretty much a utilitarian.
<br>
As much utility as possible, for as many people as possible, for as long as
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p>So, if you're asking, do I agree with ALL forms of personal empowerment, my
<br>
answer is a definitive no.  I'm a big fan of lots of them, however.
