<p>My exposure to Brin has been brief, but I agree with a lot of the 
<br>
criticism of his writings that I have read.  As I mentioned on the 
<br>
Extropy list, I would have expected a professional writer, scientist, 
<br>
and Libertarian to be able to express himself in a more logically 
<br>
consistent, straightforward manner.  Instead, his arguments were 
<br>
mostly fallacious, poorly stated, and based upon a predominantly 
<br>
leftist agenda.  In my opinion, his recent essay should have been 
<br>
entitled &quot;Confessions Of A Bleeding Heart and Sanctimonious 
<br>
Libertarian&quot;.
<br>
<p>What Zero said about slander (libel) should be heeded, though. 
<br>
Brin's ideas largely seem to originate from emotional liberalism. 
<br>
That sort is always the most obstinately litigious.
<br>
<p>Good luck,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
