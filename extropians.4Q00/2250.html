<p>Ha!
<br>
<p>I told you so.
<br>
<p>See my question re what was the actual difference between having something 
<br>
in my memory and having it stored in a chip in my head, or an implanted 
<br>
hard drive, or a book on my shelf.  (The answer is not access time.)
<br>
<p>This &quot;re-entrant&quot; feature is what &quot;consciousness&quot; is really about.  You are 
<br>
aware that you are aware that you are aware, etc.  Not like the &quot;little 
<br>
theatre in the mind,&quot; but by virtue of the fact that neural processes are 
<br>
aware of each other.  Koestler used this idea more or less implicitly, but 
<br>
he didn't know all the mechanisms.  He thought, as I recall, it was due to 
<br>
competing releases of hormone-like neurochemicals that cued mental focus, 
<br>
among other things.
<br>
<p>If Edelman is correct, then it involves layers of cross-communication 
<br>
between neural networks as well, to a degree of complexity that would be 
<br>
virtually impossible to fully emulate via linear processing.  In fact, it 
<br>
is probably provable right now that you could not do such an emulation in 
<br>
realtime, simply because no switching device could possibly operate fast 
<br>
enough.  Maybe you could run an emulation at 1/10,000 human speed with 
<br>
reasonable accuracy.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, although neural nets get you through the first set of problems 
<br>
in an emulation (and note just how much linear processing it takes to 
<br>
emulate a simple real hardware neural net) I don't see any indication that 
<br>
neural nets are capable of handling the problem of reentry on the level 
<br>
Edelman indicates.
<br>
<p>So, if we are planning on uploading, and retaining real consciousness, then 
<br>
we are likely to need some radically new hardware designs.  Just faster 
<br>
computing ain't goin to make it.
<br>
<p>But those are not the end of the problems for uploading, by any means.  I 
<br>
well recall discussions of neural nets in the early '70's, in which it was 
<br>
naively argued that they could substitute for the human brain - by 
<br>
themselves, as they were then, if sufficiently large.  Neural nets have 
<br>
come a long way, but they still have not satisfied the criteria of 
<br>
&quot;intent.&quot;  I argued then that the mind was formed by competing processes 
<br>
&quot;taking action,&quot; not just processing input.
<br>
<p>What Edelman's message will hopefully drive home to the naive uploaders in 
<br>
Extropic circles is that the mind is not a floating consciousness.  It is 
<br>
an integrated part of a biological organism.  In order to preserve the 
<br>
essence of our minds, it will be necessary to look very carefully at what 
<br>
that mind really is.  It is NOT just a set of algorythms and data.  It is 
<br>
part of an integrated &quot;system.&quot;  &quot;Memory,&quot; as Edelman argues, is a &quot;system 
<br>
phenomynon.&quot;  It isn't stored someplace separate as in a PC.
<br>
<p>The really nasty result of taking the naive upload position, as I have 
<br>
discussed before, is that we might find ourselves, via any of several 
<br>
plausible routes (eg., incremental replacement of biological 
<br>
sensory/memory/processing with chips like the ones UCI is working on) with 
<br>
Stepford people - or worse, Stepford SIs, who were utterly unconscious and 
<br>
utterly unworried by that fact.  Such machines might easily pass any number 
<br>
of Turing tests and even present themselves as more plausibly human than 
<br>
the real humans, but they would just be dead machines, with no more real 
<br>
awareness than my motorcycle.
<br>
<p>(I really worry about the people who don't find that to be a problem.)
