<p><em>&gt;I doubt that as well!  But cite von Neumann, Turing and Church for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pointing out that a Turing machine can do everything a massively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parallel distributed system can do given enough time and tape.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;use massively parallel systems today because they are faster than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cheaper than doing these jobs serially, not because there are some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things that massively parallel systems can do but Turing machines
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can't.
</em><br>
<p>The reason that neural computers are relevant in discussion of
<br>
similarities to brains and that Turing machines are not is that
<br>
in fact neural (massively distributed parallel) designs *come from*
<br>
modelling and reverse engineering of brains! In no way are brains
<br>
like Turing or Von Neumann architecture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; @ Any thought is possible, there are no boundaries to imagination.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes, there are.  Try to think of a REALLY BIG NUMBER.  Now think of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;number that long with all of its digits randomized.  You can imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it as an opaque term (just like most of us can only imagine a number
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as large as a trillion) but you can't actually hold it in your mind.
</em><br>
<p>But in inventing and articulating the above example you provide evidence
<br>
to us that you HAVE thought of what you describe. Anyway, you pointed
<br>
out earlier that true randomness doesn't exist, so a machine would have
<br>
the same conceptual problem about that that we do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Alternately, try to imagine all of Shakespeare's Hamlet at once.
</em><br>
<p>By &quot;at once&quot; do you mean &quot;instantaneously&quot; or do you mean &quot;a very short
<br>
time, like 2 seconds.&quot; ? I can imagine both ... as a very blurry noise and
<br>
flash of actors moving on stage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Hey.  That's sort of like the memory limitations on a computer.  Hmm.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt a computer could &quot;imagine&quot; anything at all .......
<br>
<p><em>&gt; @ Apparently there are more possible moves in a game of chess than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; @ there are atoms in the universe, and there are presumably an (infinite)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; @ different possible games of chess.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, you're right if you count games where the players keep
<br>
moving their pieces back and forth in a circle.  They can do that an
<br>
arbitrary number of times.  But I don't think that's quite what you meant.
<br>
<p>Absolutely, it doesn't matter that there is some repetition, I just used
<br>
this to
<br>
prove my point against your original claim about atoms.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; This is because we are talking of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; @ dynamic potentials. The thing with MVT is that we recognise a non-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; @ physical component ... this is true infinite-state!
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Non-physical components may well be infinite-state.  But non-physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;components can't interact with physical ones, so they can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;measured.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Why do you bother in making claims about non-physical components?  Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not settle for purely physical animal intelligence and be done with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this stupid field of philosophy?
</em><br>
<p>Do you have problems accepting the evidence for phantoms limbs?
<br>
These &quot;non-physical components&quot; have been widely accepted by science
<br>
for hundreds of years, and certainly aren't disputed by those afflicted
<br>
with phantom pain.
<br>
<p>The key point of MVT, and how it DOES explain consciousness, is that
<br>
the phantom limb (or phantom sense-organ) is a *felt* phenomenon.
<br>
The difficulty in measuring such phenomena does not make them less
<br>
real .... but just points to a shortfall in our methods of measuring.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;John and I actually DO think that the human brain is (analogous to) an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;oversized Turing machine.  We think that it's programmed, and that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;make &quot;decisions&quot; the same way that Deep Blue &quot;decides&quot; to move its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;bishop.
</em><br>
<p>(S)&gt; How can any Turing machine, a glorified card-reader, have
<br>
(S)&gt; experience?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That's a Really Good Question.  But how can atoms, a glorified billard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;game, have experiences? ;)
</em><br>
<p>Only biological organisms can act independently from purely
<br>
chemical stimuli ...so we are talking about a very small subset of
<br>
&quot;atomic structures&quot; ... even more specifically, those animals with
<br>
E-1 brains.
<br>
<p>My personal (plenumist) view is that atoms are themselves doubtful
<br>
as discrete entities, and I disagree with Heraclitus (?) claim that
<br>
&quot;only atoms and the void are real.&quot; I think that a Popperian third world
<br>
of consciousness is independent of physical action, but is not &quot;void.&quot;
<br>
<p>A hole has a &quot;shape&quot; and &quot;size&quot; given in terms of its
<br>
substrate ... for instance a keyhole, or hole in the
<br>
road has measurable dimensions and we talk about holes
<br>
meaningfully .... even though they do not comprise of any matter.
<br>
Phantom limbs, and the phantom median eye, are functional gaps
<br>
as much as physical holes (although they do have physical correlates,
<br>
eg. the space where the physical arm was).
<br>
<p>Another functional gap might be a missing piece of computer data.
<br>
<p>(S) Anyway, big blue is a CPU machine, not even a neural computer, so is
<br>
(S) absolutely nothing like a brain. Are you saying the DNA is the
<br>
(S) &quot;program&quot; or what other medium are you identifying?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The medium is your neurons.  None of them can do anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-physical.  So your brain can't do anything non-physical.  So your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brain is entirely physical.  Physical stuff happens in lock-step
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(because time happens in very small quanta) so the brain is emulatable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with a sufficiently complex Turing machine.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, neurons in isolation can't do much, but taken as a matrix
<br>
(maybe even including brain stem and both nervous systems)
<br>
they are able to generate a phantom pineal eye, which can deal
<br>
with &quot;abstract&quot; or phantom data .... a complete theory of mind
<br>
should explain how, for example, we can see objects although
<br>
our lateral eyes are closed, or &quot;hear&quot; an internal voice even though
<br>
our mouth is closed and we are not talking out loud.
<br>
<p>There is even a question about non-physical quanta effects
<br>
(action at a distance &amp;c.) so even atomsaren't as &quot;solid&quot; and physical
<br>
as you seem to claim ... let alone if we speculate on the physical or
<br>
non-physicalness at the very centre (the Singularity!) at the middle of
<br>
a black hole).
<br>
<p>Let me now reject your Turing machine nonsense yet again  .....
<br>
(1) Emulation is not the same as the thing being emulated, so even
<br>
if a Turing machine could emulate the functions of a brain, we are
<br>
no further forwards.
<br>
(2) The Turing emulation would not &quot;feel&quot; anything, and could not
<br>
dream (for example).
<br>
(3) Your account does not get rid of the homunculus (in your deep blue
<br>
case a whole team of homunculi ... human programmers tweaking
<br>
the software). MVT is a fully self-servicing and evolutionary account.
<br>
<p>S &gt; Hang about, Deep Blue is an extremely limited program that just plays
<br>
S &gt; common chess. It is so dumb it can't even play other chess-like games,
<br>
let
<br>
S &gt; alone &quot;learn&quot; ... it cannot even start to cope with natural language.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We AI people have a problem.  People say: &quot;You can't make a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'learn.'&quot;  Then we make them learn.  They respond to things in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;environment in an interesting and useful way.  And people say: &quot;THAT'S
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not really learning!  THIS is learning!&quot;  So we make them do that, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they say &quot;THAT'S not really learning!  THIS is learning!&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Do you KNOW how long people said that we couldn't make a computer that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could improve its own playing style?  And to then come back and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people say &quot;Hah.  Chess is easy!&quot;  It chills a man's heart, I tell you.
</em><br>
<p>I think there is a difference between look-up table &quot;learning&quot; and neural
<br>
learning such as Reinforcement Learning (eg. in world champ. Backgammon
<br>
software &quot;NeuroGammon.&quot;) or Learning I.A.C (interactive activation &amp;
<br>
competition .. a distributed database alternative modelled on brains).
<br>
<p>Changing play style is trifling stuff .... and I should
<br>
know, having designed or programmed three Chess-type games (Shogi,
<br>
Chaturanga .. ancestor of common chess, which is a mere human-era
<br>
Chaturanga variant!, and Enochian Chess, which includes an IAC neural
<br>
patch).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Improving your game of chess is learning.  It's simple learning, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it IS learning.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, on the most simple definition, but nothing like human-scale.
<br>
Deep Blue is an autistic moron!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;More to the point, we don't do anything more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interesting, on a metaphysical level, than what Deep Blue does.
</em><br>
<p>Speak for yourself mate!
<br>
<p>(S) &gt; What about extrapolation abilities
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Deep Blue extrapolates.  &quot;Not enough!&quot;  I don't care.
</em><br>
<p>But it can't change its programming or deal with new situations,
<br>
its microcosmical &quot;chess-rule world&quot; is an artificial human-made
<br>
game-world to start with. It doesn't think like Kasparov, but uses
<br>
brute-force algorithms suited to von Neumann processing.
<br>
<p>(S)&gt; how can programs alter themselves to deal with entirely new
<br>
(S)&gt; circumstances?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Not all PEOPLE are good at that.  But nonetheless, an adequately
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complex Turing program can &quot;deal with&quot; circumstances as new as we can.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe not all are good at it, but even the stupidest human can do it.
<br>
Deep Blue can't. Which Turing machine are you talking about here ...
<br>
one of your (E-1 brain-powered) imaginary ones perhaps?
<br>
<p>S &gt; But precisely my point is it has not control over any &quot;memory&quot; of
<br>
S &gt; the temperature setting, this is made EXTERNALLY and is not
<br>
S &gt; within the thermostat's remit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The same thing happens to us.  We don't have free will.  Nothing is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;within our remit.
</em><br>
<p>Plants, and simple E-2 (pineal eyed) animals have no free will.
<br>
There behaviour is governed by the sunlight and seasonal shifts,
<br>
plus chemical taxis &amp;c. However, we E-1 animals have gained
<br>
indepence from external governance of behaviour rom sunlight
<br>
(via the old pineal eye) and *do* have self-volition or free will.
<br>
<p>The term &quot;free will&quot; would not ever have been invented if things were
<br>
otherwise ..... the fact we can discuss it proves it almost.
<br>
<p>s&gt; So you are completely wrong in
<br>
S&gt; anthromorphising that the thermostat &quot;desires&quot; a setting. A digital
<br>
S&gt; switch is On or OFF, there is no intermediate or internal state, either
<br>
S&gt; current goes through it or not. It cannot override its programming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Neither can you.  Your programming is more complex, but that's all.
</em><br>
<p>Yes I could ... like Captain Scott ... decide to override my body and
<br>
voluntarily freeze to death!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You act according to your desires and beliefs.  You cannot change your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;desires very much, and you can hardly change your desire to desire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different things at all.  You cannot change your beliefs either.
</em><br>
<p>As an NLP and Hypnotherapy practitioner, of course I reject your
<br>
claim as completely groundless.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can decide what to say, but you cannot decide, for example, to drop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your view about MVT and agree with me.  You have to be convinced, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you're not in control of when you get convinced.
</em><br>
<p>I could decide to drop MVT, and would if (1) you could refute it, or
<br>
(2) you outline a more convincing alternative theory that solves more
<br>
questions and I considered to be a better account.  Go ahead,
<br>
convince me!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You're not in control of when you're happy.  You do things to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yourself happy because you desire happiness because that's part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;program.  When you do things, you have only the slightest control over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether they make you happy or not, and considerably less control over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your desire to feel happy.  You're not in control of these things.
</em><br>
<p>What are you babbling about here? I don't recognise any of these
<br>
statements in myself. Are you talking from your own, solipsistic viewpoint?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A 128-bit thermostat knows the current setting on the heater, along
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the desired temperature down to almost 40 decimal places.  It has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;128 on-off switches stringed together.  It knows 128 on-off facts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You know on the order of several hundred billion of them.  But not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more than that.  Not infinite, by a long shot.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed. I never claimed such a device to be infinite-state.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And what suggests consciousness besides intelligence?
</em><br>
<p>Intelligence PLUS felt experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What test do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;YOU have for consciousness besides intelligence?  Surely not phasic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transients?  I can make my Turing machine flick its eyes about.
</em><br>
<p>I think the onus is on you to make a case why someone who claims
<br>
to have consciousness is in fact a robot. The subjective nature of
<br>
the phenomena does maybe rule out &quot;objective&quot; tests, so indeed
<br>
some new form of testing might be needed. Am more interested
<br>
in developments from MVT, what I can do and predict from it, than
<br>
in satisfying some sterile academic or philosophical debate.
<br>
<p>S&gt; The very fact that every aspect of Turing machines actions can be
<br>
S&gt; predicted, I would say, might even preclude them from consciousness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No more than you are precluded from consciousness.  Your atoms have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;free will.  You are composed entirely of atoms.  You have no more free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will than they do.  An adequately informed and powerful computer could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;calculate your every move in a controlled environment.
</em><br>
<p>Again (see above) you are looking at 'me' on the wrong level of
<br>
description ..... why say I am composed of atoms rather than I am
<br>
composed entirely of &quot;cells&quot; or &quot;molecules&quot; or &quot;sub-atomic particles?&quot;
<br>
None of these levels is macro enough to explain consciousness, which
<br>
requires the whole biomatrix, plus even phylogeny and embryonic history,
<br>
to be properly understood. The whole is greater than the parts ... and the
<br>
whole includes phantom body parts.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Yes, but as I try to point out, what MVT brings to table is *absent* or
<br>
S&gt; non-physical, phantom components that complete the circuit!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Right, I'd forgotten that.  But non-physical components are no more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explanatory than invoking the soul unless you have an empirical test
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for them.  How can you show that you're measuring something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-physical, rather than just physical brain activity?
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but you have accepted that at least you, even if nobody else)
<br>
has *dreams* .... which are non-physical ... they are temporal events
<br>
but cannot be detected by crummy human-era science. So just by
<br>
accepting dreams, as you have, then a distinction is made between the
<br>
conscious experience, and the PET or EEG activity of the brain, which
<br>
is detectable to scientists (but is unknown to the dreamer ... you don't
<br>
need
<br>
to know which of your neurons are firing in order to have thoughts).
<br>
<p>S&gt; A cathode ray tube is infinite-state in that it is fully variable,
<br>
scalar,
<br>
S&gt; but because it operates within boundaries it is ANALOG. This stuff
<br>
S&gt; is fairly rudimentary solid-state physics, you have no grounds to be
<br>
S&gt; obfusticating here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Analog is NOT infinite-state.  It is very-many-state.  Really big
</em><br>
<em>&gt;number.  So big that you can approximate that they're infinite in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the equations and get correct results.  But they are NOT
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infinite-state.  The analog to infinity is only *really big*.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seem to keep forgetting that.
</em><br>
<p>Not even to &quot;really big&quot;. A component can be scalar as
<br>
opposed to digital over a very narrow spectrum. It is just that it is
<br>
a continuum potential rather than just discrete digital switching
<br>
that leads it to be called analog. In terms of AI, the reconfigurable,
<br>
evolvable
<br>
hardware used by Thompson et al is solving fairly trivial AI problems
<br>
compared
<br>
to mammalian-type variety of intelligence. An analogy can be stretched, so
<br>
&quot;bigness&quot; is just another subjective term .... your big might be my small.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That's the difference between infinite-state and awfully-many-state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's the difference between transcendent and awe-inspiring.
</em><br>
<p>Only an abstract, non-physical component can be properly infinite-state.
<br>
Can't you see this? Your transcendent is my mundane.
<br>
<p>S&gt; No, phasic transients occur simply because a circuit is undergoing
<br>
S&gt; transformation from finite-state (lock step) to self-organising ....
<br>
S&gt; and they happen after the removal of an external clock (whether
<br>
S&gt; electronic or organic pineal eye). Aren't Turing machines always
<br>
S&gt; lock-stepped?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why, yes.  Along with ATOMS.
</em><br>
<p>There aren't any atoms in a phantom pineal eye, or in a thought ....
<br>
your dreams cannot be observed precisely because they are NOT
<br>
atomic!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I've not seen data that shows that phasic transients occur on account
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a circuit going from finite state to very-many-state, but I'll take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your word for it, because it hardly matters.  Very-many-state is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infinite state, so a Very-large Turing machine can do the job nicely.
</em><br>
<p>Size isn't important!
<br>
Absence, presence, and detection of presence are the real issues.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Absolutely. The main body of MVT concerns comparative brain
<br>
S&gt; anatomy and behavioural difference between E-2 and E-1 animals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ah.  That's good news.  But you just got through telling me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligence is not consciousness, around line 150 or so.  So while I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really do hope you have an excellent theory of intelligence on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hands, a perfect theory of intelligence is, unfortunately, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-explanation of consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>But MVT gives an account of why mammals dream, and furthermore
<br>
throws new light on the melatonin hypothesis, and Menaker's work
<br>
on REM and the evolutionary shift from pineal eye melatonin to
<br>
retinal production. DREAMS are not &quot;intelligence&quot; and do not involve
<br>
'rational' cognition of processing of sensory information from external
<br>
world ..... so MVT explains consciousness here rather than intelligence.
<br>
<p>In fact, I think the computation/ intelligence mechanisms can largely be
<br>
explained in terms or local and general neuronal circuits (I qualified in
<br>
neural computation) WITHOUT having to invoke MVT ....
<br>
<p>S&gt; You obviously haven't read anything of MVT. All mammals and birds
<br>
S&gt; are E-1, and have REM. No cold-blooded animals have REM. The
<br>
S&gt; pineal eye atrophied across all species during the reptilian/mammalian
<br>
S&gt; boundary, and during the emergence of endothermic (internal or warm-
<br>
S&gt; blooded strategies). There is a clear experimental correlation between
<br>
S&gt; absence of pineal input (after pinealectomy, or when pineal eye has
<br>
S&gt; been covered by metal foil and subject reptiles compared with a control
<br>
S&gt; group) and intelligent behaviour ... *awareness* ... I don't really like
<br>
to
<br>
S&gt; use the &quot;C&quot; word!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Actually, I knew that tidbit.  But then you're observing intelligence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not consciousness.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The problem of other minds asks: &quot;I know I'm conscious and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent, and I know you act intelligently.  But are you conscious,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or do you just act that way?&quot;  This is a problem which your theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't solve.  Keep your pants on, a solid theory of animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligence will still win you the Nobel, but it won't help you solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the mind-body problem.
</em><br>
<p>No, see above. The &quot;atomic&quot; brain is necessary, but not sufficient
<br>
for consciousness. The virtual sensor(gan) is need to complete the
<br>
gestalt experience of being intelligent. It is a substitute for sense
<br>
messages from the sun and environment that used, in early evolution,
<br>
to govern behaviour .... but also includes the &quot;felt&quot; aspects of the organ.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Yes, as I mention above, there are about 130 years of records of such
<br>
S&gt; experiments.  Other minds is an artificial lingoistic problem, it
<br>
S&gt; doesn't stop  consciousness (sentience) happening, just gives
<br>
philosophers
<br>
S&gt; something to argue amongst themselves about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yeeeeessss.  But so is the mind-body problem.  Why do you even CLAIM
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to have solved it?  Why not sit pretty with a theory of animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligence and let the philosophers do their jobs on consciousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for which you have no physical explanation?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I am a reductionist on these matters, and believe that human-era
<br>
philosophers just perpetuate &quot;problems&quot; and do little to contribute to
<br>
solutions. They are not qualified to make judgements on physiological or
<br>
empirical issues ... academic philosophy seems to just be linguistic
<br>
analysis.
<br>
In fact, together with religion, they are an unnecessary Mystery Industry
<br>
that
<br>
actual obstructs new knowledge and solutions so as to safeguard their
<br>
incomes and paltry reputations. MVT is a more complete and basic theory
<br>
than any narrow linguistic (definititional) account of the mind-body
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p>It solves dualism ... since Leibnitz objection to Descartes is overcome.
<br>
A non-physical part of the brain can interact with non-physico-spatial
<br>
thoughts ... like can only interact with like. The phantom median eye
<br>
is constructed out of the same neuronal type of information as the sensory
<br>
contents, so can reintegrate or focus all the diverse types of mentation and
<br>
give a pervasive locus of self. The phantom median eye is an illusion, or
<br>
trick of nature ... sure ... but then what mental experience isn't illusory?
<br>
(We do not have actual light and sound whizzing through our brains, just
<br>
action potential signals, which the phantom median eye allows simulation
<br>
of actual light &amp;c to be experienced. There is a lot more to be said on
<br>
this.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Newborn infants seem to have empathic abilities, plus abilities
<br>
S&gt; to monitor and judge emotions in others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So does a lie detector.  Another input device to attach to a complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Turing machine.
</em><br>
<p>But we have a difference of type here .... lie machines and Turing devices
<br>
do not occur in nature. They are designed and built, and are not evolved,
<br>
living beings. The type of consciousness we are discussing is mammalian.
<br>
And besides, I deny totally that lie detectors are empathising ... they do
<br>
not replicate the feelings of the subjects, just look for incidental tells
<br>
like
<br>
conductivity of sweat or whatever.
<br>
<p>S&gt; It is a fair bet that if someone
<br>
S&gt; is screaming in pain, particularly if they have correlating signs such
<br>
S&gt; as a red-hot poker sticking up their arse, that they are actually feeling
<br>
S&gt; pain, in much the same way you would. I really fail to see the problem
<br>
here,
<br>
S&gt; other than that you cannot be the other person so have to rely on
<br>
reports.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That IS the problem!  The problem is that I have no proof that brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;activity implies actual feelings (in anyone but me), only with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behavior.  This is a rather boring philosophical problem.  I recommend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that you ignore it, that you never think on it again, and sell the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world your theory of animal intelligence.  Most importantly, never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;again use the word consciousness.  You have no proof of that.  Nor any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reason to care!  So skip it.
</em><br>
<p>Do you agree with McGinn that the mind-body problem is insoluble?
<br>
If so, then you can pack up and go away. If you think that it can be solved,
<br>
then you must also allow that an evolutionary account is needed. I accuse
<br>
academic philosophers of &quot;THE ATHENA FALLACY (TM)&quot; ... that they
<br>
deal with mind as if it sprung fully formed as &quot;human&quot; from the split head
<br>
of
<br>
Zeus ... and ignore the intermediate stages and natural processes that
<br>
led to the current state of things.
<br>
<p>MVT puts forwards a set of predicates that can be challenged, and
<br>
conclusions
<br>
that follow from these, that can also be challenged. Yet no philosophers can
<br>
falsify MVT .. although I have been shoving it up their noses since 1980.
<br>
<p>S&gt; NO. Fodorian modules and central executive theories, supervenience
<br>
S&gt; and all the other philosophical lingoistic drivel are not physiology
<br>
S&gt; based, nor do they give a clear account of the *evolution* of
<br>
S&gt; consciousness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But neither do you.  Consciousness IS philosophical drivel.  Let us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;keep it.  We've reserved &quot;intelligence&quot; just for people like you, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you have something to prove and talk about scientifically and so you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guys can never run us philosophers out of a job.  Why bother attacking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophy on this point?
</em><br>
<p>As a qualified Philosopher (MA, Univ Leeds ... which I returned, &amp; Bsc,
<br>
Surrey)
<br>
I despair at the waste of everyone's time and money spent on philosophy
<br>
departments. The arrogance is bearable .. they think they can dictate to
<br>
proper mathematicians on the &quot;philosophy&quot; or overview of maths, even though
<br>
in practice they perhaps can't even add up! And they presume to tell medical
<br>
doctors what to do regards medical ethics.
<br>
<p>If there is some wonderful philosophical methods, some great secret
<br>
inaccessible
<br>
to the rest of us, why can't philosophers agree about anything? They just
<br>
cavil about words .. meanings &amp;c. And sometimes they make them up, a new
<br>
jargon, just to sound pompous and to try to stop other academics seeing that
<br>
they are like the Emperor without any clothes.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Experimental evidence can only observe behaviour .... would that be
<br>
S&gt; acceptable to you? If so, MVT has it in abundance. However, if as I
<br>
S&gt; suspect you are not happy with circumstantial evidence (correlation
<br>
S&gt; between REM and dream mentation, even in humans, cannot be
<br>
S&gt; absolutely proven since it relies on reports of the dreamer) then
<br>
S&gt; YOU have a problem, because you can never accept any account of
<br>
S&gt; consciousness, MVT or not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why YES.  I think we're finally on the same page!
</em><br>
<p>So YOU have the problem, not MVT, which comes to a high degree
<br>
of certainty as having solved the mind-body problem.
<br>
<p>Let me put this to you. No scientific theorum can be proved 100%
<br>
(cite Heisenberg's principle). But we have to judge between the contending
<br>
theoretical models and make the best choice. As it happens, the only
<br>
competitor to MVT is Jerison's Recency Theory .. which can be fairly
<br>
easily dismissed. So if MVT is just 50.1% likely ... more likely than not,
<br>
then we are OBLIGED to accept MVT until a fuller account arrives.
<br>
<p>Any competing theory can only be 49.9% probable, at best.
<br>
<p>S&gt; No-one has come up with a better idea than MVT, which explains both
<br>
S&gt; walking and sleeping consciousness (24/7). Your Turing machine idea
<br>
S&gt; doesn't even reach first base, it only models intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But what do YOU get besides intelligence?  Besides intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behaviour?  Hell, what do you NEED more than than that, besides
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophical drivel?
</em><br>
<p>MVT extends the Neuromatrix theories of self, and gateway theory of pain
<br>
(used by most clinicians) to give an account of felt experience and
<br>
self-referential states. It ties together an evolutionary story that
<br>
includes
<br>
mechanisms for transition to endothermy, the reasons for REM and
<br>
mechanics of dreaming, PLUS it overcomes Leibnitz Law (to be fully
<br>
identical the two things must be fully interchangeable) thus gets rid
<br>
of Cartesian dualism.
<br>
<p>What philosophical drivel do you think is needed? Please make a case.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Perhaps I should develop new and irresistible hypnotic applications
<br>
S&gt; from MVT and enforce belief in it ... would this satisfy you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It would certainly get you that Nobel!
</em><br>
<p>If I wanted that, I could just hypnotise them to give it me anyway!
