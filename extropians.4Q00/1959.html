<em>&gt;Subject: New Member Intro &amp; Mailing List Approval Procedure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Sun, 5 Nov 2000 00:29:51 EST
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm not a Libertarian (mainly because I don't think the conditions are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right for such a philosophy to be practical), but can respect those who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are.
</em><br>
<p>This goes into something I've been thinking about recently. I voted 
<br>
Libertarian in the one presidential election I was old enough to vote in, 
<br>
and I intend to do so in this one. At the same time, I know that if a 
<br>
Libertarian were president tommorow things would fall apart quickly. I agree 
<br>
that the conditions are not right for it to be practical. By &quot;conditions&quot; I 
<br>
mean one thing, the attitudes of most of the people who live in this 
<br>
country. People want their welfare and social security and they'd riot if 
<br>
they didn't get it. There are also not enough people intelligent enough to 
<br>
manage all the new industries that would come up as a result of government 
<br>
de-regulation. Who knows how to manage a private freeway or privatized FDA 
<br>
properly? I don't think anybody does, and I think that without them there 
<br>
would be a lot of car wrecks and food poisoning.
<br>
The solution, and reason I'll still vote for them, is that any political 
<br>
philosophy must go hand-in-hand with democracy. All of what I've said above 
<br>
would be false if a Libertarian actually got elected president in an 
<br>
election, because it would mean a sizeable percentage of the population had 
<br>
voted for him. If a sizeable percentage of the population are voting 
<br>
Libertarian, it means they probably are smart enough to manage their own 
<br>
lives and to run successful businesses that would provide the services 
<br>
government no longer would be.
<br>
Voting for them contributes to the small percentage of the vote they will 
<br>
recieve. It draws attention to them, which will attract more people to 
<br>
laissez-faire type thinking, and hopefully to the belief and practice of 
<br>
being responsible for themselves.
