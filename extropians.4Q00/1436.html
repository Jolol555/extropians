Counselor Burch:
<br>
<em>&gt; I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know how anyone could maintain that, say, Sweden in the 1970s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or 80s had achieved some insurmountable zenith of perfection in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrangement of human affairs.
</em><br>
<p>No, absolutely not. I don't think you can have a better set of civil rights
<br>
protections than the Benelux and Scandanavian countries, although sometimes
<br>
one man's civil rights protection is another man's civil rights restriction,
<br>
as with bans on handguns or on beating kids. No War on Drugs, although
<br>
Sweden taxes tobacco and alcohol mercilessly. Gay marriage. And the majority
<br>
of citizens are atheists, or at least secular.
<br>
<p>Also in the economic sphere, social democracies have generally not pursued
<br>
the level of worker ownership and control that I favor. Left social
<br>
democrats in Sweden have been pressing unsuccessfully for decades a set of
<br>
reforms that would basically give all workers stock options as a part of
<br>
their compensation. The stock options would be non-fungible, and be
<br>
controlled through local councils with elected or appointed representatives
<br>
from the community and the unions in the industry. The goal would be to
<br>
slowly transfer stock to the councils so that they would hold the majority
<br>
of shares after about fifty years. (BTW we would have that here if pension
<br>
fund managers and the managers of Social Security ever decided to invest our
<br>
pension funds and Social Security funds in the stock market - &quot;pension fund
<br>
socialism.&quot;)

<em>&gt; Of course, liberals like Hughes have always maintained that

</em><br>
<p>Again with the inaccurate name-calling? I'm not a &quot;liberal&quot; in either the
<br>
classical European usage or the fuzzy, but nonetheless delimitable, American
<br>
usage. I'm a radical democrat, an internationalist, a democratic socialist
<br>
with libertarian leanings, a Viridian techno-optimist Green, a queer
<br>
feminist Buddho-revolutionary who wants to live forever and go to the stars.
<br>
But not a liberal.
