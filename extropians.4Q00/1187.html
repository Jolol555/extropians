<p>Today was a bad day. I've had these obsessive/compulsive/denial/stress
<br>
i-just-want-to-sit-and-play-with-the-computer-like-a-zombie episodes so
<br>
many times now that I can see them coming and actually have it together
<br>
enough to analyze them. Not prevent them, but at least be conscious of
<br>
what's happening and why.
<br>
<p>In this case, it was because of the virtual stack of grad school apps
<br>
that I have to fill out (every last one of them is either online or PDF
<br>
format). Fill out and confront the fact that I was a total loser for
<br>
the last 10 years. 10! My god, what kind of crazy school would accept
<br>
that? 2.74 GPA baby, a few failed classes *in* my major, and a research
<br>
apprenticeship I mysteriously dropped. I mean, my average GPA for a
<br>
humanities class is actually higher than my math/sci GPA. I think I
<br>
could have gotten better credentials just by drinking myself senseless
<br>
every night and answering randomly on exams.  My advice to those still
<br>
in college is-- don't take time off, and don't let thinking interfere
<br>
with learning or even more importantly grades. Above all, don't let
<br>
anybody break your heart. They come anywhere near your myocardial
<br>
region you bite their goddamn fingers off. You'll find better somebodys
<br>
further down the road.
<br>
<p>The joke gets better. I'm using a follow-the-interesting-research
<br>
strategy and there is aging research being done at Harvard, Yale, and
<br>
MIT. So my strategy dictates that I apply there. MAN is somebody in
<br>
admissions going to get a good laugh out of this one.
<br>
<p>At least I've compiled the URLs of the schools I'm considering into one
<br>
big list, so that I can apply to a few every time I have a spare
<br>
minute.  I've already applied to USC. I anticipate the rest will be
<br>
easier. What allows me to keep going with this is the fact that I
<br>
actually expect to fail this time around, and have a (suitably
<br>
Transhumanist) contingency plan.  If I don't get in anyplace at all,
<br>
I'll either go back to making money as a computer guy (and find the
<br>
most effective way to drive research forward with it) or I'll just keep
<br>
taking supplementary classes, apply to a Masters program, work as a
<br>
lab-rat, whatever it takes to rescue those credentials. I think before
<br>
what stressed me out was the good old fear of the unknown-- &quot;I win
<br>
or... what?!&quot;. Now it's &quot;I win or I keep on fighting until I win or I
<br>
keep on fighting until...&quot; etc. Sort of like the closing words of
<br>
Starship Troopers but infinitely recursed.
<br>
<p>On the up side though, for a couple of months at least I'll have some
<br>
really current and thorough knowledge of exactly who is doing what in
<br>
aging research and where.
<br>
<p>Ah. That feels better. Sorry for ranting, thanks for listening.
