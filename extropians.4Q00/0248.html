<p>I don't know... This just doesn't sound very friendly to me.
<br>
In fact AI seems much more friendly.
<br>
Even if AI did not seem more friendly, I'd trust it more than this brand of
<br>
anti-AI fascism.
<br>
<p>&lt;...&gt;
<br>

</em><br>
<p>How very depressing. I suppose Joseph Stalin had similar feelings.
<br>
All right, go ahead and terminate me -- but can you please spare my kitty cat?
<br>
She's just a little furry feline critter... she likes to purr when she gets
<br>
petted.
<br>
Please let her live won't you? I mean, she won't ever hurt you or anything.
<br>
She doesn't eat or drink very much, and her atoms are small... so you won't need
<br>
to eat her until way later in your world domination plan. Can't you just maybe
<br>
let her go into the woods or something?
<br>
Her name is Eva, and she wouldn't hurt a fly (well, not maliciously anyway).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now assuming you're mistaken about your superhuman AI,
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you do need to make such an assumption, don't you.
<br>
Sort of like, &quot;Assuming you're mistaken about your child being human&quot; -- we can
<br>
go ahead and use it to fuel Eugene's Turing Police Patrol and Donut Factory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Enough of this crap.

<p>Now there's a quotation worthy of the Amara Graps Collection.
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Enough of this crap.&quot;
