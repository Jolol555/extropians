<p>I would further suggest that perhaps we have been too worried about
<br>
the teaching of creationism in the schools.  Teaching creationism
<br>
might well be less harmful than saying nothing at all about origins,

which pretty well describes my own public school education.
<br>
<p>Perhaps if the ideas are presented side by side, along with Native
<br>
American creation myths, the students will grok.  spike
