</em><br>
<p>Nick, I think the &quot;comparative advantage&quot; approach is a good one.  The 
<br>
problem is, for many of us, it's much easier said than done.  How does one 
<br>
go about finding out what areas one has a competitive advantage in?  I've 
<br>
been through a barrage of tests with a recognized authority in this area 
<br>
(&quot;career counseling&quot;; psychological evaluation), and was pretty disappointed 
<br>
with the recommendations that emerged.
<br>
<p>The area of consulting with individuals, to help them figure out what their 
<br>
strengths and weaknesses are, and advise them on a good career path 
<br>
accordingly, seems to me to be far from an exact science, and in much need 
<br>
of improvement.  Indeed, if someone could figure out how to do it well, and 
<br>
establish a good track record, such could be a very lucrative, scaleable 
<br>
business.
<br>
<p>When the leaders of Taiwan decided it was time to get serious about economic 
<br>
development they hired Western consulting firms to evaluate and report on 
<br>
the islands' areas of competitive advantage, and then promoted those 
<br>
industries accordingly.  As much as top-down approaches to development such 
<br>
as this bother me, I have to admit that Taiwan has done pretty well by this 
<br>
approach.  Paradoxically it seems that, at least for some people, it's more 
<br>
difficult to discern an individual's areas of comparative advantage than a 
<br>
whole country's.
<br>
<p>By the way, starting a Russian prostitution racket is one of the least 
<br>
extropic business ideas I can imagine, in part because it would almost 
<br>
surely result in the untimely death of the entrepreneur, by murder.  Such 
<br>
has been the fate of many Russian entrepreneurs who have been successful 
<br>
enough to get the attention of their competitors.  (Of course I recognize 
<br>
this wasn't a serious suggestion).
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>Bill
