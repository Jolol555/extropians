<p>I think you can make an economic case that privacy should be paid for, or
<br>
at least cost something. i.e. you can pay for a an ISP, or you can use a
<br>
free ISP that requires you to give up more of your privacy. There are many
<br>
other examples. I am talking about this in respect to voluntary actions-
<br>
there probably should be some minimum of privacy guaranteed as perhaps a
<br>
&quot;human right&quot;, but in terms of voluntary decisions you make such as signing
<br>
up with an ISP or this mailing list, it makes sense to charge money for
<br>
complete privacy. So perhaps ExI could consider making one of the benefits
<br>
of paid membership the possibility that they would completely remove all info
<br>
on you (besides, say your email address which could be a nym) if you request
<br>
it.
