<em>&gt; Yes we can, because there are not that many ways how to make efficient

</em><br>
<p>People once said that it was impossible to move through the air faster
<br>
than air (sound) itself could.
<br>
<p>People once said that is was impossible to propel oneself through the
<br>
vacuum of outer space.
<br>
<p>People once said that nothing could move faster than light under any
<br>
circumstances.  (There's still debate over whether anything useful is
<br>
being moved in the latest experiments.)
<br>
<p>Part of technology is finding ways around limits.  There's a provable
<br>
maximum efficiency for chemical rockets?  Fine, switch to another
<br>
propulsion (say, fuel or light) with provably higher limits.
<br>
Eventually, switch to moving without propulsion - synchronized quantum
<br>
teleportation over large distances, for example.  The only absolute
<br>
limit on that line, barring time travel, is being able to move instantly
<br>
from one place to another...at which point, your per-stop time dominates
<br>
your speed of colonization, so teleport masses of terraformig/industry
<br>
building/colonization nanites to your target to colonize your target in
<br>
a blink, and speed up production of said nanites to lessen time between
<br>
colonizations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Assuming that physics is not changeable, of course, which is a rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safe bet.
</em><br>
<p>Give me fixed physics and a sufficiently large amount of ingenuity and
<br>
resources, and I can get you practically anything.  (Some things are
<br>
impossible as is, but other things which serve the same ends as well or
<br>
better are present for every human desire I've seen.  Even if sometimes,
<br>
the desire - say, colonization of the universe - must be unmasked from
<br>
its expression - say, colonization of the universe with current
<br>
technology - in order to discern the best way to satisfy it.)
<br>
<p>The Singularity, if it exists, doesn't peak.  It merely goes on until we
<br>
advance our ways of thinking sufficiently that we can see the future
<br>
once more.  I base this claim on what I see every day, as some people
<br>
think the immediate future is an unimaginable tech (u/dis)topia, until
<br>
they get handle on the realities of what's out there.
