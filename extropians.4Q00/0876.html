<p><p>I am a Silly Con valley libertarian although I haven't struck it rich
<br>
yet as you seem to misapprehend we'uns here in the land of high rent all
<br>
have.  So, your thought is to not invest your vote until somone richer
<br>
than you invests a lot of bread.  Your analogy does not hold.  No one
<br>
asks you to invest one cent if you don't want to.  Although as far as I
<br>
can see it would make could sense to invest minimum libertarian party
<br>
dues ($35) as you seem to agree with most libertarian positions.  Let's
<br>
see, if 1 million people just signed up and made the minimum dues...
