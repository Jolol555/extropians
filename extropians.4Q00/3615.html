an
<br>

<p>Ahh, that's the stuff I didn't read. Righto.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If &quot;emergent&quot; is not just a euphemism for &quot;magical&quot; then this

consciousness
<br>

studied

<p>So if we take the hackneyed and probably misleading analogy of
<br>
consciousness-to-computer, the positions become these:
<br>
<p><pre>
---
<p>A program is a set of instructions to be carried out by a computer. It can
be incribed in a stone tablet as well as stored in computer.
<p>A computer is a machine which knows how to interpret a set of instructions,
and do what they instruct it to.
<p>A process is an instance of a program running on a computer. The same
computer, running the same program multiple times simultaneously, is running
multiple, distinct processes.
<p>---
<p>John (and the Dennet camp in general?) maintain that
consciousness/intelligence is the program. It is the pure information, the
set of intructions, and thus has all the properties of digital information;
particularly, it can be flawlessly copied. Copies are not distinct things;
they are all the same information, and so are the same.
<p>Jason, and myself, and possibly David Chalmers (although I can't be certain
of this), propose that consciousness is somehow part of the running process;
it is distinct from the computer (or the wetware of the brain), it is also
distinct from (although well described by) the program, the instructions
which the machine is following; the way the brain is wired up.
<p>Damien, and probably someone else in the world, takes a third position; that
intelligence/consciousness is actually the substrate, the computer, the
physical brain. More acurately, I think he proposes that it is the
combination of program and machine, the brain given a particular
configuration.
<p>Am I correct in these attributions?
