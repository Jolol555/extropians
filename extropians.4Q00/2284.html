All good, except you are a bit misinforming. Actually it was the Democrats
<br>
who paid for that Tues. Nov 7th afternoon telemarketing firm to go out and
<br>
call all those people in Palm Beach. Of course they have plausible deniability,
<br>
but it is pretty clear to me that they poured some serious gasoline on this
<br>
right from the beginning. I will be completed disgusted (as a FL voter!) if
<br>
the &quot;only hand recount 4 counties and declare Gore the winner of FL&quot; scenario
<br>
comes to pass.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the size of the county be a factor?  If you arbitrarily drew two
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; such sorting would change the picture significantly.  On the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand, all four quadrants of a chart sorted by percentage of Buchanan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; votes should be unchanged by the arbitrary division, that is, all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; four quadrants should still be a moderately Buchanan-favorable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 0.79%.  So they like Buchanan down there in Palm Beach, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should not be a shocker.  Some other counties like him even better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do we really wish to argue that high population *density* should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead to a lower *percentage* of legitimate Buchanan votes?  Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do allow me to put another spin on this that is relevant to extropians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We know that the press can plant an idea in the minds of the masses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What was done was to contact a telemarketing firm, which called a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bunch of people, thousands, and *planted in their brains* the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they may have voted for the wrong guy, which they responded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to en-mass.  There were more people who signed petitions saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they may have mistakenly voted for Buchanan than there were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Buchanan votes!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The scary part of this is that the press has such power to influence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the masses, and that this may someday be very destructive to what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians wish to accomplish.  For instance, suppose truly dramatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breakthrus begin to be made in life extension.  Could not the press
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jump all over this, and plant in the minds of the masses the idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few wealthy technocratic elite have discovered the fountain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; youth, which you, the poor victimized downtrodden proletariat, will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never be able to afford, but which will result the overpopulation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our delicate planet and in your grandchildren and their grandchildren
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to being robbed of their future and ground into poverty for perpetuity, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This display of power by the press is quite disturbing.  spike
