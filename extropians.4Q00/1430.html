<p>It reminds me of when WIRED magazine came out. I kept wondering why it wasn't 
<br>
a completely E-magazine. The answer of course is money. Money to produce it, 
<br>
money to sustain it, money to count as profit, money to pay salaries, etc, ad 
<br>
nauseum. We talk of nanites and cyberuniverses and whatnot; yet we still have 
<br>
to survive in the Newtonian Realm of meatspace. So, perhaps, Ex and Trans 
<br>
people will have to adopt marketing techniques to promote themselves?  That 
<br>
will require time, effort, and (sigh) money. Also a &quot;business plan&quot; of some 
<br>
sort to coordinate it. Maybe tschockes may not be a bad start?
