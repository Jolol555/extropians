<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Ibn Hazm in the beginning
<br>
there existed a single language given by God,
<br>
thanks to which Adam was able to understand
<br>
the quiddity of things. This tongue provided
<br>
a name for every thing, and a thing for each name.
<br>
But if such a prior language existed, why should
<br>
have men undergone the unprofitable task of inventing
<br>
other idioms? And if it did not exist, which was the
<br>
source of our natural languages? The only explanation
<br>
is that there was an original language which included
<br>
all others. The confusion did not depend on the
<br>
accidental invention of new languages, but on the
<br>
fragmentation of a unique tongue that existed
<br>
ab initio and in which all the other were already
<br>
contained. - Umberto Eco -
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Genesis 11 we are told that after the Flood,
<br>
&quot;the whole earth was of one language, and of
<br>
one speech&quot;. Yet, human beings in their vanity
<br>
conceived a desire to rival the Lord, and thus to
<br>
erect a tower that would reach up to the heavens.
<br>
To punish their pride and to put a stop to the
<br>
construction of the Babel tower, God confused
<br>
their languages.
