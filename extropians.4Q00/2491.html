</em><br>
<p>I see parallels between your situation and what mine is (and probably most 
<br>
other people as well). One thing might be that you haven't made enough 
<br>
preparations for life. My &quot;day job&quot; (QA software tester) is not very 
<br>
fullfilling either, and it's a 45 minute commute one way. I don't expect it 
<br>
to be fullfilling. I've never thought that selling my labour to someone for 
<br>
them to achieve their goals would be fullfilling. It's not as bad as it 
<br>
could be. It's rarely over 40 hours, and by skipping lunch and working a 
<br>
heavy Monday-Thursday, I can work just half a Friday. Having to work for 
<br>
someone else is not fun, but I don't expect people to just give me money 
<br>
they have earned so that I can do what I want.
<br>
Having some sort of fullfilling work is, I think, a requirement to be happy, 
<br>
and I have that, it's just not my day job. I've decided that I wanted to 
<br>
direct a movie so I bought the neccessary equipment and did it. I'm 
<br>
currently editing, and this goal occupies much more of my creative thought 
<br>
time then anything relating to testing of software. I don't expect to make a 
<br>
profit on this one. If luck is on my side, I could break even, or make half 
<br>
my money back. I will consider it successful if it becomes publicly 
<br>
available in some way and I am contacted by people who enthusiastically 
<br>
enjoyed it.
<br>
I'd recommend that you stop expecting your day job to bring you anything 
<br>
expect money. Put all your energy at work into that which will bring you 
<br>
more money. If it's not bringing you enough money, start looking for a new 
<br>
job. You can set a very high salary requirement right now since you have 
<br>
something secure already, then lower it to more reasonable levels over a 
<br>
period of six months or so. In the meantime, find some &quot;fullfilling work&quot;, 
<br>
some project which is important to you. It sounds like living as a &quot;techno 
<br>
hermit&quot; might be such a thing, if that's it then you could start researching 
<br>
what you'll need to do to reach that goal. Get books on solar/wind power, or 
<br>
whatever. My parents at one time were thinking of generating their own 
<br>
power, so I know it's a thing that will take years of study. As for taxes, 
<br>
you could find some way to make the land generate income for you and pay 
<br>
them with that. I can't think of any off the top of my head, maybe grow 
<br>
Christmas trees.
<br>
As for savings, just cut back on your living expenses. When you need to, 
<br>
it's easy. Spend a month keeping track of every purchase you make, and then 
<br>
at the end of the month look at your list and ask yourself how you could 
<br>
trim 15% from it.
<br>
And why do you have a house you don't really want? Sell it and get an 
<br>
apartment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Some specifics from this side:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have attained a fairly reasonable level in my career (sysadmin/CM) and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fairly well-paid.  However, the work does very little for me other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bringing in money to pay for the things that I need, but can't provide for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;myself without the media for exchange.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've got some money in savings, and I've been working on investing it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;slowly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to try and get a good nestegg going.  However, it seems my savings are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;growing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;slower than the cost of living.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I gre up rural - I know how to take care of things like animals and plants, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I wouldnt' mind returning to that sort of a life partially - not a Luddite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hermit like the Unabomber, but a techno-hermit, with satellite uplink,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computers, generating my own power, taking care of most of my needs without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reliance on the outside.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But in the end it comes down to the tyrany of money.  There is no place I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can live without either the fear of imminent confiscation by the latest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;banana republic despot in the name of &quot;land reform&quot;, or the need to have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sort of steady income to pay the various property taxes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So here is the conundrum.  The land that is inexpensive enough to afford is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;too far from the places I am capable of finding work (did I mention I'm a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;widely-read, hopefully well-spoken high school grad?  No college diploma
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here, unfortunately - and that cuts my options down even more), and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;land
</em><br>
<em>&gt;close enough to be able to work reasonably is very expensive now, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for what would be needed for this sort of subsistence, and at the same time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's also prone to the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; property tax progression - one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;farmer sells out to a developer for 50 units, and they agree to add $5000
</em><br>
<em>&gt;per acre in property taxes for new schools - after all, they're only paying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;$500-$1250 at best for their share, but the farmer next door just got 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tagged
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for $500,000 more per year, and is forced to sell to a developer, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;goes on and on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And my work does very little toward allowing me to pursue the things I hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most dear - because I have to spend so much o my time dealing with traffic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and working most of my waking hours to pay for the house I don't really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the gas I would like to not have to use to get to and from a job that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't really line up with my personal interests.  But it's the trap of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moneyed system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, I understand a true libertarian society would have a different set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problems, and I could find a place where I wouldn't have to pay property
</em><br>
<em>&gt;taxes - but if you can show me a true libertarian nation I could move to...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There.  Specific enough?
</em><br>
