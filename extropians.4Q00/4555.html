<p><em>&gt; Anglic empirism versus continental rationalism? 
</em><br>
<p>Very much so.  In this regard, I look forward to the upcoming book on the 
<br>
&quot;Anglosphere&quot; by Foresight director Jim Bennett, excerpts from which I've 
<br>
been privileged to see.  In the meantime, I think it extremely instructive to 
<br>
compare the workings of the two legal systems and the impact they have on 
<br>
innovation. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  So the main issue is how to set up the feedback so that it adapts at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  an optimal rate, and also adapt the &quot;strength&quot; of the corrections it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  sets up to avoid too little or too much feedback. Oh, it is just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  simple optimization problem, as a friend once said about economy :-)
</em><br>
<p>Right.  You've pretty much summarized in &quot;systems&quot; terms the central problems 
<br>
of jurisprudence.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  Actually it sounds a bit like the learning problems we are studying in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  neural networks and the brain - how does a system set its learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  rate so that it is optimal for a given environment, and adapt it fast
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  enough (metalearning) when the environment changes. In this example
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the individual cases and market provides the first level of learning,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  setting the price for various risks. Then there is both some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  adaptation where various cases and political decisions influence the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  strength of the feedback and adaptation to changes in the amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  super-mega-risk? 
</em><br>
<p>There are finally some people who are beginning to think of jurisprudence 
<br>
with the precision the passage above suggests.  In fact, there's a developing 
<br>
field of study of the interaction of &quot;AI&quot; and jurisprudence.  See, for 
<br>
instance:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/~dla0www/centre/web_ai_a.html">http://www.dur.ac.uk/~dla0www/centre/web_ai_a.html</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
<br>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flair.law.ubc.ca/jcsmith/logos/noos/machine.html">http://www.flair.law.ubc.ca/jcsmith/logos/noos/machine.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The problem seem to be that while there is no shortage of learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  material on the first level (the everyday cases and transactions),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  making learning relatively efficient, you get far less learning and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  more reliance on the a priori methods on the metalevel.
</em><br>
<p>The analogy in the US court system is between the trial court level and the 
<br>
succeeding layers of appellate courts above.  The US federal court system 
<br>
(fortunately) publishes the result of many trial court cases (most state 
<br>
court systems do not, which actually tends to stress the activity of the 
<br>
&quot;metalevel&quot; over the &quot;first level&quot; in your terminology).  In fact, a good 
<br>
argument can be made that one (although by no means the only) reason that the 
<br>
federal court system tends to dispense a better quality of justice is the 
<br>
availability of a rich depository of &quot;first level&quot; case reports.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Maybe it could be improved if there was a better way of accumulating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and learning from such decisions on a global scale (a bit like how I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  think politicians might have use for a database showing the results of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  decisions similar to ones they are considering). This is of course the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  job of the historians.
</em><br>
<p>One idea behind having a tiered system of appellate courts is that &quot;global&quot; 
<br>
issues become refined into fundamental questions and then that their 
<br>
resolution can be applied across the whole system back at the lower levels.  
<br>
One idea that Jim Bennett and I have discussed is the need for an 
<br>
international level of operation for the Anglo common law system.  Of course, 
<br>
divorcing the notion of &quot;law&quot; from that of &quot;sovereignty&quot; would be necessary 
<br>
to do this - a step most extropians have taken long ago, but which most of 
<br>
the world seems amazingly ill-prepared to consider.
