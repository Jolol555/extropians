<p>&lt;&lt; &gt; No, he said 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable 
<br>
from &gt; magic.&quot; He did NOT say that it WAS magic. THINK.
<br>
<p>If something is indistinguishable, than what is the difference?  (Which 
<br>
brings us back to Leibniz's Law)&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Think harder. It is indistinguishable for a primitive observer, but not for 
<br>
the *wielder.* I don't think a gun is magic (come to think of it, some 
<br>
gun-control advocates seem to think guns are --evil-- magic, but that's 
<br>
another subject altogether); just because some primitive spear chucker thinks 
<br>
it is doesn't *make it magical.*
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Anyway, since when is our destiny of a mundane nature?  This notion has 
</em><br>
only &gt; &gt; been commonly believed for a very short duration of humanity's 
<br>
existence-
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'd also argue that this notion is purely transitionary, a kind of &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
collective &quot;dark night of the soul&quot; (as a mystic would put it) before 
<br>
ourinitiation into the Transhuman existence...
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nobody is going to give us a leg up, there is no Galactic Confederation, 
</em><br>
Von &gt; Daniken was a moron, and Childhood's End was FICTION. Get over it.
<br>
<p>I agree with all that you mentioned, but no one has yet explained why we have 
<br>
not already been overrun by other transsentient cultures or see no evidence 
<br>
of their existence- I see only three possible explanations-
<br>
<p>1. We're the only planet in the universe that has developed sentient life. 
<br>
(Highly unlikely)
<br>
2. All sentient cultures are doomed to destroy themselves- there is no 
<br>
singularity, no offworld colonization, no transsentience- so your entire
<br>
extropian movement is moot, and we should best look elsewhere for our answers.
<br>
3. By gaining cognition of the universe at a level beyond our comprehension, 
<br>
they have gained an understanding that has allowed them to transcend the
<br>
objective universe and become, essentially, gods.&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Here's a few more:
<br>
<p>4. Sentient life is far more common than *technological* sentient life. We 
<br>
might be the only species in this galaxy that has gone from simple tool use 
<br>
to an actual technology-wielding civilization. If you look at the history of 
<br>
humankind, you can see that our leap to technology was a rather unlikely 
<br>
event, due to a fortuituous juxtaposition of circumstances. Otherwise, our 
<br>
technological development would have remained slow and incremental (i.e., 
<br>
compare technological progress between 10,000 B.C.E. and 1500 C.E. to 
<br>
technological progress between 1500 and 2000 C.E.).
<br>
<p>5. FTL is impossible, and technological societies eventually become content 
<br>
with settling down comfortably in their own solar system (why bother seeding 
<br>
other worlds when there is no conceivable return?). 
<br>
<p>6. An advanced society doesn't necessarily expand to fill every available 
<br>
niche in the universe. Even if FTL is possible, an ultra-tech society may 
<br>
reach zero population growth, and may expand beyond its boundaries very 
<br>
slowly, if at all (in fact, it might be that the ability to control 
<br>
demographic pressures is a prerequiste for developing an interstellar 
<br>
civilzation).
<br>
<p>7. Once they advance high enough, advanced species migrate to the core of 
<br>
their galaxies, where more plentiful energy sources are available, leaving 
<br>
the relatively cool fringes to us primitives. Note that this is different 
<br>
from #3 because a race that may decide black holes make for excellent 
<br>
batteries does not necessarily have to &quot;transcend the objective universe.&quot;
<br>
<p>And that's off the top of my head. None of which buy any yams, btw. We ain't 
<br>
gonna achieve Transcendence (or even build a better mousetrap) by looking 
<br>
breathlessly toward the skies waiting for some Savior.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Supernatural, adj. 1. Existing outside of, or exhibiting properties&gt; 
</em><br>
contradictory to the laws of, the natural universe.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, transhumans are NOT supernatural. Inhabitants of a Universe Prime, 
</em><br>
running &gt; our universe as a quantum simulation, would be supernatural 
<br>
deities, but
<br>
they &gt; cannot interfere with the simulation.
<br>
<p>Hah!  You're forgetting something- our knowledge of the so-called &quot;laws&quot; of 
<br>
the &quot;natural universe&quot; are, in fact, the most likely interpretations that our 
<br>
senses and our limited brains are able to give us.  A transhuman would
<br>
be supernatural, in the fact that through the knowledge and manipulation of 
<br>
forces beyond the comprehension of &quot;mere mortals&quot;, they could essentially 
<br>
alter realities in ways that could only be seen as going beyond the &quot;laws&quot; of 
<br>
the universe.  Which, again, brings us back to Arthur C. Clarke's 
<br>
statement...&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Maybe. Then again, maybe not. A Transhuman's greater understanding of the 
<br>
forces of nature might be able to manipulate said forces in ways we cannot 
<br>
currently comprehend, without going beyond those laws (and they most likely 
<br>
will have their own unrealized goals and aspirations, and probably somebody 
<br>
whispering to them that something greater and beyond their ken lies somewhere 
<br>
ahead). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; incredible: lacking credibility. Sorry, any Power I ever meet would likely 
</em><br>
be &gt; very credible in its existence. Overwhelmingly so. It might be amazing,
<br>
but it &gt; would not be mystical or supernatural.
<br>
<p>This cannot be known until it has been experienced.&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>One can make a reasoned guess. I don't *know* that an Angel of the Lord is 
<br>
going to suddenly appear in front of me and tell me I am the clone of the 
<br>
Messiah, but I can make a guess it's not going to happen.
<br>
<p>Open minds, but not so open your brain falls out.
