<p><p>Disease hope as brain cells are grown in the lab 
<br>
<p><p>Robin McKie, science editor 
<br>
Sunday October 15, 2000 
<br>
<p><p>Scientists have discovered how to grow human brain cells in the laboratory.
<br>
They have isolated neurones from several key areas of the cortex and plan
<br>
to transplant them into patients suffering from epilepsy and strokes, as
<br>
well as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. 
<br>
Transplants of human brain cells have already been demonstrated in clinical
<br>
trials. However, each requires neurones that have been taken from at least
<br>
six aborted foetuses. Scientists believe their breakthrough research has
<br>
solved this crucial problem of supply. 
<br>
'We could satisfy the demands of every Parkinson's patient in Europe and
<br>
the United States with cells grown in one small laboratory,' said Dr George
<br>
Foster, of Cardiff University. 'That's the immense potential of this
<br>
technology.' 
<br>
The technique employed by the group - based at Cardiff and Sheffield
<br>
universities - involves the immortalisation of brain cells in culture
<br>
dishes. Neurones are bathed in chemicals that switches on a gene that keeps
<br>
the cells dividing indefinitely. The end result is an abundant supply of
<br>
human neurones. 'Other groups have managed to grow rat and mouse brain
<br>
cells in the laboratory,' said Dr Brad Stringer of Sheffield University.
<br>
'We were the first to succeed with human neurones.' 
<br>
The human cells isolated come from the striatum, cortex, hippocampus and
<br>
brain stem. When neurones die in these areas, they produce, respectively:
<br>
the fatal Huntington's disease; Alzheimer's; strokes and epilepsy; and
<br>
Parkinson's disease. 'That means we now have a supply of specialised brain
<br>
cells that could be used to replace the cells lost in these conditions,'
<br>
said Foster. 
<br>
The group has taken out a string of patents to protect their technologies
<br>
and have launched their own biotechnology company, CellFactors. 
<br>
'We have also developed a parallel technique for growing bone cells -
<br>
called human hypertrophic chondrocytes - in the laboratory,' added company
<br>
chief executive Dr Iain Cubitt. 
<br>
The firm has launched pre-clinical brain cell trials, at the Institute of
<br>
Psychiatry, London, on stroke victims, and intends to begin clinical trials
<br>
on transplants for Parkinson's disease patients by the end of next year.
