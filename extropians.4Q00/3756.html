Here's additional documentation that there was in fact an MOL launch on
<br>
Nov 3, 1966
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.pafb.af.mil/heritage/6555th/6555ch4/6555c4-4.htm">http://www.pafb.af.mil/heritage/6555th/6555ch4/6555c4-4.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Another TITAN IIIC was launched from Complex 40 on 3 November 1966, and
<br>
it boosted a modified GEMINI spacecraft and three secondary satellites
<br>
into orbit during a largely successful experimental mission on that
<br>
date.27

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26 August 1966
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Air Force intended to use Complex 40 for its Manned
<br>
Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) flights, Complex 41 eventually supported all
<br>
the TITAN IIIC missions launched from the Cape between the beginning of
<br>
1967 and the end of the decade. On the first of those missions, a TITAN
<br>
IIIC boosted eight IDCSP satellites into orbit on 18 January 1967.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 November 1966                   from their website.

<a href="http://www.pafb.af.mil/heritage/6555th/6555ch4/images/tgmolz.jpg">http://www.pafb.af.mil/heritage/6555th/6555ch4/images/tgmolz.jpg</a> is a
<br>
launch photo of the Gemini B / MOL launch previously discussed.)
<br>
This photo clearly shows the Gemini capsule on top of an extended upper
<br>
stage section that is likely a full size MOL prototype, and the heavy
<br>
solid boosters would not be needed to launch simply a gemini capsule and
<br>
an empty simulation of an MOL. Only a fully fuelled and equipped space
<br>
station would need the 45,000 lb launch capacity of this Titan IIIC
<br>
booster.

The Akwa-Downey Construction Company began building Complex 40's MOL
<br>
Environmental Shelter shortly after the second TITAN IIIC mission in
<br>
October 1965. The Shelter was ready for beneficial occupancy by the
<br>
middle of June 1966, and American Machine and Foundry completed
<br>
installation of the Shelter's work platforms two weeks later. As we
<br>
noted earlier, a modified GEMINI capsule was launched from Complex 40 as
<br>
part of an experimental mission on 3 November 1966. That capsule had
<br>
been launched and recovered during the GEMINI 2 mission, but it was
<br>
modified by the McDonnell Aircraft Company to perform a heat shield test
<br>
for the MOL program. The modified capsule was installed in the MOL
<br>
Environmental Shelter on 3 October 1966, and it was launched with the
<br>
rest of the TITAN IIIC's payload one month later.
