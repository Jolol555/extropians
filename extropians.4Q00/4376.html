<em>&gt;&gt;Al Gore's National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1986?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Gee that's odd Harvey, a Google search turned up a wealth of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;information on this act, but not one mention of Al Gore.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Try harder.  The references I gave came from a Google search.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I posted the newspaper articles that give Al Gore credit for this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bill.  Did you not read my entire post?
</em><br>
<p><p>I read your post, every word, but it's clear you're ignoring mine.
<br>
<p>The fact is that an extremely well done, and highly acclaimed,
<br>
history on the origins of the Internet has already been done. As I
<br>
already pointed out it was accomplished in 1996 and is called
<br>
&quot;Where Wizards Stay up Late: The origins of the Internet. Your pal
<br>
Al Gore has exactly one line in the book, where they say he was
<br>
invited to the 25 anniversary party for his interest in the
<br>
&quot;Information Superhighway&quot; not the Internet, but &quot;The Information
<br>
Superhighway&quot;. If you read carefully it also had alot to do with
<br>
the fact that BBN was having problems with the government at the
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>I don't accept you're version and neither does anyone else who was
<br>
there. The fact is that all during the eighties and nineties there
<br>
were rival groups, the Internet, and the Information superhighway
<br>
crowd. Al Gore backed the loser, now he's trying to re-write
<br>
history, and so are you.
<br>
<p>That's right, I was there, I read everything that came out during
<br>
the whole period on the subject, and watched Al Gore fumbling along
<br>
the whole time. I've been on the Internet since administrators used
<br>
to ask you to keep off their systems during the day, so we accessed
<br>
Europe during the normal nighttime there. I remember spending alot
<br>
of time at the site at CERN and playing with an interesting text
<br>
based system  the creator was calling the world wide web. I still
<br>
have the E-mail I got back from him thanking me for my comments and
<br>
telling me they were working on a GUI for it, and after that he
<br>
hoped it would really take off... Need I even bother mentioning his
<br>
name?
<br>
<p>So since we're the only ones discussing this, and neither of us is
<br>
going to listen to the other, I'm dropping this, confidant a future
<br>
web search by anybody interested will point them to vital evidence.
