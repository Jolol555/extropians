[I ask that these comments not be forwarded elsewhere as I have not had
<br>
a chance to develop them in detail.  They are presented here for feedback
<br>
from Extropian list members.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given that individuals discount the future, invariance requires that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agents weight the past more heavily than they do the present.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other words, it requires that a thirty year old cares more about an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apple that was consumed at age three than about an apple to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumed today.  moreover, the importance of that apple at age three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relative to an apple today must grow at an exponential rate as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumer ages.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think this is a good example, because experiences at age 3 are
<br>
unusual in a couple of respects.  First, many of us have considerable
<br>
childhood amnesia which will still carry over to age 3.  This makes
<br>
experiences from that young age unusual compared to most past experience.
<br>
<p>Second, the argument implicitly relies on the three year old's view
<br>
of the relative importance of his life at age thirty.  But three year
<br>
olds do not have an adult's developed sense of rationality.  An argument
<br>
about the rationality of discounting towards the past or future should
<br>
be based on rational actors.
<br>
<p>A better example would be a 60 year old considering an apple eaten when
<br>
he was 30.  However IMO that does not make the case as sharply as the
<br>
(misleading) example presented.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This implication of invariance is difficult to accept.  Rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewing past consumption as progressively more important as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumer ages, it is more plausible that agents discount past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumption.  When asked most people would prefer having completed an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; onerous task last week over having to perform one this evening; they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would prefer a pleasurable meal this evening to one ten years ago; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would prefer to be leaving on vacation to returning to work when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their vacation is over.[Notes 5,6]  Whenever one thinks, &quot;I'm glad it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is finally three o'clock and that lecture is over,&quot; it reflects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discounting of the past.  The disagreeable experience is less painful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when it is in the past than when it is being experienced in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present.[Note 7]
</em><br>
<p>These examples don't make the case at all well, and in fact they are
<br>
clearly a completely different phenomenon.  According to reasonable views
<br>
of discounting, the degree to which the immediate future and past are
<br>
discounted would be practically nil.  Yet most people would far prefer
<br>
having an unpleastant experience one minute in the past than having it
<br>
begin in one minute.  This cannot be due to discounting.
<br>
<p>IMO the real effect here is that we prefer situations in which our
<br>
life is improving.  Whatever our current status, we want to improve it.
<br>
We aim for a situation where bad things are in the past and good things
<br>
in the future.  In any case, whatever the reason for this preference,
<br>
it is not an effect of discounting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Beyond revealed preference, the strongest theoretical argument in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favor of discounting, involves what Bohm-Bawerk referred to as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;brevity and uncertainty of human life.&quot;  According to this view,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people discount future felicity because they may not be around to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enjoy it.  An individual weighs pleasures at date t by the conditional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability of living until date t.
</em><br>
<p>I think there is more to it than this.  The future is inherently
<br>
uncertain.  We are all familiar with the maxim, a bird in the hand is
<br>
worth two in the bush.  Consuming goods in the present gives us guaranteed
<br>
value.  Holding them until the future presents many hazards.  We may
<br>
die, as mentioned above.  But there are other things that can go wrong.
<br>
We could lose the goods or they could be stolen.  They could go bad.
<br>
Our circumstances could change so that they are less valuable, etc.
<br>
<p>Presumably such factors, acting through evolutionary pressure, have
<br>
programmed discounting into us.  With a good enough theory we could
<br>
probably even predict or explain the observed discount rates, based on
<br>
conditions in our remote past.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a parallel between mortality and forgetfulness.  The past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dies when we forget.[Note 8]  Do we value today meals eaten ten years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago, if we cannot even remember what we ate?  How is our current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utility reduced by past pains that we cannot even remember?  Imperfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory justifies discounting the past in much the same way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mortality justifies discounting the future, and just as mortality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests that we discount the far off future more than the near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future, imperfect memory suggests that we discount the far off past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than the recent past.
</em><br>
<p>I can't see how evolutionary effects could cause discounting of the past.
<br>
There is nothing you can do to change the past so it doesn't matter what
<br>
you think of it, unlike the future.  The analogy between mortality (and,
<br>
as I suggest above, other sources of future uncertainty) and forgetfulness
<br>
is not accurate because the one has operational effects and the other
<br>
does not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, heterogeneity in discount rates across individuals undermines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the case for retrospective consistency.  If, as is commonly believed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rich and educated are more forward looking, do they place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively _less_ weight on the past as invariance would require?  To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the extent that individual discount rates are endogenous, as argued by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Becker and Mulligan [1997], does the weight on the past adjust to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintain delta = 1/beta?  Or is the weight on the past also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endogenous?  After all, we spend considerable resources keeping the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past alive, through stories, photographs, souvenirs, and diaries.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the weight on the past is endogenous, wouldn't it be a remarkable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quirk of fate of [sic] this weight were exactly equal to the inverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the discount factor?
</em><br>
<p>I think there would be at least weak evolutionary pressure designed
<br>
to make delta = 1/beta, that is, to make us view our past decisions
<br>
as reasonable.  Otherwise we would constantly be fretting over things
<br>
we can no longer change.  Also, we might be tempted to change our
<br>
actions to bring delta into line with 1/beta, which would imply giving
<br>
relatively greater weight to the future.  But as I have argued above,
<br>
there are already evolutionary reasons for us to discount the future,
<br>
and any factor which would introduce a bias into that discount rate
<br>
would reduce survival.
<br>
<p>(In fact, this seems to be a strong argument against the authors'
<br>
proposal, in that it would seemingly apply to any society which has
<br>
evolved an optimal discount rate for their conditions.  The authors
<br>
would step in and propose to manipulate things to decrease the discount
<br>
rate and give more weight to the future, hurting the survivability of
<br>
that society.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We conclude that in almost any reasonable formulation, future selves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight current consumption less heavily than does the current self.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The implication is that tastes change over time.  We now consider the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welfare implications of this observation.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree that this effect can be aptly described as &quot;tastes changing
<br>
over time&quot;.  Your tastes don't change, all of your likes and dislikes
<br>
are stable.  Furthermore, whatever changes you would experience in regard
<br>
to your future satisfaction with current decisions are fully predictable.
<br>
In consuming today, you are fully and completely aware that you will
<br>
regret it tomorrow, in the authors' formulation.
<br>
<p>I have a couple of other points to make, the first being that if this
<br>
effect were real it would be both self-evident and widely recognized
<br>
(&quot;stop me before I consume again&quot;), and second that there _are_ in fact
<br>
arguments along these lines which IMO would be more convincing (such as
<br>
a claim that our evolutionary heritage has left us with a discount rate
<br>
inappropriate for modern society, as it has with our tastes in food).
<br>
I will expand on these in a future message.
