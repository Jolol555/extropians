That's right. Fundies will try whatever they can to win their unholy war against
<br>
reason and science. The most responsible thing for science to do is to breed SI
<br>
(thereby precipitating TS) as soon as possible.

<p><p><em>&gt; My guess is the Fundamentalists will use every weapon at their disposal. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A.I can become vulnerable to attack or even controlled by Jerry Foulwell (now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's a notion!) then he will use it to advance his causes, even though he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has to deal with the devil of technology. Would an A.I. be able to defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself against such attacks? I am guessing that internet attacks in the hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Fundies will be no different then any other piece of technology. So the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;backdoors&quot; hypothetically, will be probed for vulnerabilities by religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fanatics.  Once accessed, the A.I.'s could become a weapon in the hands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smillin' Jerry.
