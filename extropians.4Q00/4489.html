<p>
I want to be part of the eternal, ongoing, completely free Transhumanist
<br>
Voice Conference Call, no matter what I'm doing at the time.  (Though I'd
<br>
probably want to shut it off while working...)
<br>
<p>I want to look at a Taco Bell, perform a mental click, walk past it a
<br>
minute later and have my favorite order handed to me.  That's all.  No
<br>
other effort should be required on my part.
<br>
<p>I want to visit a completely unfamiliar restaurant and know which menu
<br>
items were recommended by people who like my favorite Taco Bell order.
<br>
<p>I want to visit a supermarket and know which laundry detergent was
<br>
manufactured by a corporation that best follows libertarian principles.
<br>
<p>I want to go to a science-fiction convention and see auras indicating
<br>
whether people are transhumanists, or at least computer programmers.  For
<br>
that matter, I want to see the same auras when I'm walking down the
<br>
street.
<br>
<p>I want an ambulance called if my heart stops.
<br>
<p>I want a kinesics analysis program that automatically highlights dominance
<br>
indicators in a social interaction, signs of nervousness or lying, and so
<br>
on.  I want the same program to remind me if my own kinesics drift out of
<br>
line.
<br>
<p>I want eyes sewn all over my clothing and a visual recognition program
<br>
that sounds a very loud buzzer if anyone draws a gun.
<br>
<p>I want a noise cancellation program, or else a selective pass-through,
<br>
that lets me keep track of individual conversations at gatherings, or at
<br>
least cancel out the one wailing baby on an airplane flight.  I also want
<br>
a directional microphone.  (&quot;If you do not wish a thing heard, do not say
<br>
it.&quot;  -- Klingon proverb.)
<br>
<p>I want to, around once per ten minutes whenever I'm not at home,
<br>
spontaneously emit a nickel.  The nickel should have a chance of striking
<br>
any given person within 20 meters which is proportional to the inverse of
<br>
the square of the distance between us.
<br>
