<p><p>*That* is a stupid justification for banning something. Who cares if
<br>
it isn't used for civilian hunting?  It isn't like it has ever been
<br>
used for anything bad either.  Actually, bayonet lugs are most
<br>
commonly used to mount flashlights in my experience, for safety reaons
<br>
(I don't, but a lot of people do).  Who the hell would bayonet someone
<br>
if they have a rifle?  Bayonet lugs exist as a battlefield contigency
<br>
and take some skill to use; they exist on civilian weapons because it
<br>
saves manufacturers money not to fork a design for military
<br>
contract parts for no obvious reason. It boggles my mind that people
<br>
fixate on such a truly superficial feature.
<br>
<p>If we applied your reasoning to everything, you'd lose most of the
<br>
things you own, and everything that remained would have far fewer
<br>
features.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Flash suppressors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't do anything that has any applicability to criminal use (if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you think it does, you don't know what a flash suppressor is for)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and falls under the same category as barrel shrouds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They're great for hiding the source location of snipers, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at night.
</em><br>
<p><p>You had to do it...&lt;sigh&gt;.  A flash suppressor does *not* (repeat:
<br>
does *not*) have any use for hiding snipers.  In fact, real snipers
<br>
intentionally do not use flash suppressors because it actually
<br>
increases the muzzle signature (yes, really). But then, if you knew
<br>
what you were talking about you wouldn't have mentioned it. Remember,
<br>
the real world isn't like the movies.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So you don't want the herd to know where you're picking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them off from?  It's not a (game) hunting attachment.
</em><br>
<p><p>Some people don't seem to use their brain much either.  Should we
<br>
demand that they get a lobotomy?  Sure they seem harmless now, but a
<br>
fool is just *begging* for trouble.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Folding/collapsible stocks are good for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; paratroopers and small statured people that can't use a rifle that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has a regular stock because of length-of-pull issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's a reasonable civilian use, but a short stock will do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same.
</em><br>
<p><p>Congratulations, you shit on your own argument.  The NFA that you love
<br>
so much forbids shortened stocks, as it makes rifles &quot;too
<br>
concealable&quot;. The only &quot;out&quot; in this was collapsible/folding stocks.
<br>
Thanks to the '94 gun control legislation, these are now also banned.
<br>
I know a great number of Asian women who *require* collapsible stocks
<br>
to use a rifle, as any NFA legal stock has a length of pull that is
<br>
too long.
<br>
<p>As I said, &quot;well-intentioned but poorly educated&quot;.
