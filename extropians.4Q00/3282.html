Michael S. Lorrey commented on my statement,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Killing oneself means murdering someone who can't fight back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How cowardly!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, JR, thats a bit of a reach. Just as a right to speak implies a right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to choose to not speak, a right to live also implies a right to choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to not live. Restricting that enslaves the individual to the state.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, don't call suicide cowardly. Come to think of it, many situations
<br>
could make suicide an heroic act. For example: Killing oneself so that one
<br>
doesn't become a burden or bankrupt one's heirs, and so forth.
<br>
Nevertheless, if one commits suicide in order to avoid more responsible
<br>
courses of action, then it does correlate to pusillanimity or something
<br>
similar.
<br>
<p>There is another kind of suicide called Nirvana, the extinguishing of the
<br>
self.
<br>
That's another nightmare.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>

&quot;The government consists of a gang of men exactly like you and
<br>
me. They have, taking one with another, no special talent for
<br>
the business of government; they have only a talent for getting
<br>
and holding office. Their principal device to that end is to
<br>
search out groups who pant and pine for something they can't get
<br>
and to promise to give it to them. Nine times out of ten that
<br>
promise is worth nothing. The tenth time is made good by looting
<br>
A to satisfy B. In other words, government is a broker in pillage,
<br>
and every election is sort of an advance auction sale of stolen
<br>
goods.&quot;
