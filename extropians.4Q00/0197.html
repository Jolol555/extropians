</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Yeah, it probably does. 
</em><br>
<p>It's not clear that the kids *have* First Amendment rights while they're at
<br>
school.  Courts have generally found that they have some civil rights at 
<br>
school, but far more curtailed than an adult would have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But in the fifties, I remember students at my school
</em><br>
<em>&gt;didn't ever (ever) consider rebelling on the basis of infringement of first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amendment rights. 
</em><br>
<p>Kids today are more indignant.  (I am reminded of the study that found that
<br>
American kids lagged behind other developed countries in all academic areas
<br>
but led the world in self-esteem.)
<br>
<p>The trouble with asserting rights as a kid (or as a parent, on behalf of your 
<br>
children) is that after you've made a stink, you have to go back to the same
<br>
school, to the same teacher.  And won't they be glad to see you....
<br>
<p>And kids want to blend in, not stick out.  They worry not just about how the
<br>
teacher will retaliate but whether the other kids will tease or harass them.
<br>
<p>When I finish that book on libertarianism for kids, my next book may be on
<br>
children's rights, also for kids.  What their rights are, and how to assert
<br>
them -- in school, at the mall, against their parents, etc.  It's their call
<br>
as to whether to act against an injustice; I'd like them to know what their
<br>
options are.
<br>
<p>The tough issue for me:  Kids come in all stripes and colors.  Some are mature 
<br>
and responsible, some are wild animals, and some are in-between.  From my POV, 
<br>
the rules, particularly those in school, give adults broad discretion with 
<br>
little recourse and few repercussions for treating children in a way that would 
<br>
be wholly unacceptable if applied to adults.  On the other hand, inner-city
<br>
teachers complain that, in this oversensitive, litigious age, they feel 
<br>
powerless to deal with disciplinary problems.  
<br>
<p>I think children are the one of the hardest issue for a libertarian to grapple 
<br>
with.  What rights should children have?  Where do the rights of a parent end?  
<br>
What right does the rest of society have to interfere with how I raise my child?
<br>
Should the rights be age-based, or is there a reasonable way to assess
<br>
intelligence, maturity, and judgment?
<br>
<p>The Libertarian Party platform takes a stab at it, but some of their 
<br>
conclusions seem absurd.  They feel that &quot;children always have the right to 
<br>
establish their maturity by assuming administration and protection of their 
<br>
own rights, ending dependency upon their parents or other guardians, and 
<br>
assuming all responsibilities of adulthood.&quot;  Sure....  How about three-year-
<br>
olds who don't want to take a nap?
<br>
<p>Animal rights are also hard.  Why is it a property crime to kill Koko, the
<br>
gorilla with an IQ of 70, when it's murder to kill a human with an IQ of 70?
<br>
We already have a system of fractional civil rights -- certain rights for
<br>
adult citizens vs. felons vs. children vs. non-citizens vs. retarded -- why
<br>
not extend it to non-humans?
<br>
<p>It seems to me that the issues surrounding children and animals are worth
<br>
exploring in depth because how we deal with them illuminates how we can 
<br>
incorporate new variants into our society -- transhumans, transanimals, 
<br>
clones, AIs, aliens, uploads, downloads, reanimated cryonauts, etc.  Without 
<br>
the component of BS inherent in any discussion of the latter.  Children and 
<br>
animals aren't speculative developments; they're here now, and we have 
<br>
thousands of years of experience with them.
