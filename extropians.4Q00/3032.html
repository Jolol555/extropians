<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for reporting this fascinating information!!  I've
<br>
never heard of this possibility before.
<br>
<p>Hal &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20seeing%204%20colors%20(was%20Re:%20human%20tetrachromate%20mutant%20reported)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200011292117.OAA18665@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">hal@finney.org</a>&gt; commented:

<p><em>&gt; It would take some time to get used to your two eyes seeing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different colors, but perhaps it would eventually become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconscious.  There were famous experiments back in the 60s in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people wore special glasses that turned the visual image upside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down!  After a few days they got used to it and everything looked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normal.  Then when they took the glasses off they had to adjust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again.  If people can adapt to such a radical change as this, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorporating some extra color information ought to be easy.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge categorical difference between having
<br>
additional colors in our color awareness and simply inverting an
<br>
otherwise subjectively similar image and it eventually seeming
<br>
normal.  The article touched on this a bit by pointing out that simply
<br>
having an extra 4th receptor in the eye isn't enough for us to be
<br>
aware of an additional color.  You must also have an additional
<br>
channel in the optic nerve to convey the added information to the part
<br>
of our brain where the awareness is produced (the visual cortex) and
<br>
of course the most important part of all is, one's conscious knowledge
<br>
must be enhanced to be able to produce additional quale to represent
<br>
this 4th color dimension in order to be what I would consider a full
<br>
blown subjective &quot;tetrachromate&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd bet that, given what little was in this article, It is
<br>
likely that Mrs M is simply mapping the set of trichromatic color
<br>
qualia produced by most of our visual cortexes in our consciousness a
<br>
little more broadly over the tetrachromic set of information, hence
<br>
still enabling her to distinguish differences in perception better
<br>
than a trichromat, yet not really experiencing a truly subjective
<br>
tetrachromatic experience or in other words Mrs M can't really
<br>
experience any additional subjective color qualia.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or can she!?  To me that would be by far the more interresting
<br>
question in all this.  Who cares what one can perceive compared to
<br>
what it is really subjectively like!?  As in, will I ever be able to
<br>
say: &quot;Oh wow, that gred (or whatever) color is fantastic and nothing
<br>
like I've ever experienced&quot;, thanks for enhancing my primary visual
<br>
cortex so it can produce this new quale in my subjective awareness!
<br>
Now can you make me a tetrachromat and wire the additional sensors
<br>
added to my eyes, through an addition chanel added to my optic nerve,
<br>
to this new quale my visual cortex can now produce in my consciousness
<br>
so I can be a subjectively full blown tetrachromat!?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are there more than just 3 (or 4) dimensions to the qualia
<br>
possible in this physical universe so that our visual cortex can use
<br>
such enhanced awareness to be aware of data from receptors that can
<br>
pick up additional information not just between red and green, but
<br>
from outside the visible spectrum altogether!?  I don't just want to
<br>
reuse the qualia I've got and map the additional spectrum my sensors
<br>
can pick up into this! I want more qualia too!  If so, you'd be able
<br>
to do a lot more than just zip through the internet faster!!!
