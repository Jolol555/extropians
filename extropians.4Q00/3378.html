<em>&gt;&gt;I have to agree with Michael on this part at least.  Most rural people

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm sorry, but I can't buy this as a generalization.  When I was in high 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;school in rural Illinois, I saw local community members physically attack 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strangers because they were perceived to be gay, black, Mormons, atheists, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communists, government agents, homeless or foreigners.  In my experience, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many rural people are not very tolerant of those who are different.
</em><br>
<p><p>I grew up in rural Washington, Nebraska, Idaho, and have spent inordinate 
<br>
amounts of time in rural Nevada, Minnesota, South Carolina, Missouri, and 
<br>
so forth.  While I stand by my original statement for the most part, on 
<br>
further reflection I would modify it as follows based on my experience:
<br>
<p>There are two different rural cultures in the U.S., which can be roughly 
<br>
delineated as being east of the Rockies or west of the Rockies.  The rural 
<br>
cultural east of the Rockies tends to be culturally Conservative, whereas 
<br>
the rural culture west of the Rockies tends to be culturally Libertarian 
<br>
(with the primary regional exception possibly being parts of Idaho, which 
<br>
is more Conservative).
<br>
<p>If I had to make a quick guess as to why this is, I would give two reasons 
<br>
as probable major factors.  First, it is because the more zealous 
<br>
Protestant religions (Methodist,Baptist, etc) never took hold out West 
<br>
since the space was already occupied by an old and established Catholic 
<br>
presence that seems to have evaporated on its own in recent 
<br>
history.  Second, I believe the West has been much more culturally and 
<br>
ethnically integrated for much longer than East of the Rockies.  Most of 
<br>
the rural Midwest and South is *still* ethnically homogenous; many rural 
<br>
areas are populated almost exclusively by groups such as Czechs, 
<br>
Hungarians, Swedes, Germans, blacks, etc.  People in many rural communities 
<br>
have never even seen an Asian person in the flesh (which was true of where 
<br>
I lived in Nebraska, a purely Czech town with many quaint concepts of what 
<br>
everyone else was like).  By contrast, Chinese and Mexicans figure 
<br>
prominently in the histories of States like Nevada and Arizona more than a 
<br>
century ago, and the different ethnic groups were unusually integrated 
<br>
culturally for the time, largely out of economic necessity.  I think this 
<br>
is one of the historical reasons behind the &quot;Live and let live&quot; attitude of 
<br>
the rural West.
<br>
<p>To be perfectly honest, I have difficulty stomaching Midwestern and 
<br>
Southern rural culture on an extended basis, but I can deal with rural 
<br>
Western culture just fine.
