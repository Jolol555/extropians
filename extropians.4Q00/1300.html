<p><em> &gt; Outcomes, especially ones that claim we wouldn't get to hatch if a more

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No, not at all. I never claimed the pioneers would be intelligent. It
<br>
doesn't require to be that to be able to overrun a solar system
<br>
occupied by a pre-Singularity civilization. Post-Singularity
<br>
civilisations are immune, because they themselves form the explosion
<br>
focus or don't enter the visible picture. Pioneer expansion waves
<br>
running into each other are indistinguishable due to convergent
<br>
evolution, and hence cancel themselves out. Domain boundaries might
<br>
get fuzzied out due to fitness jitter, but they should be stable.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; more advanced species than ourselves are at all covered by an analogy of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; competing firms or any other analogy from current earthside economics. 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I won't go into where your analogy isn't necessarily so clear cut even
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in earthside economics.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Who talks about economics? Not me. Just self selection of the fastest
<br>
autoreplicators. Same thing which lets a certain autocatalytic RNA
<br>
species emerge at the other end of a long capillary filled with
<br>
metabolizable substrate.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Assuming the policing agency, assuming one was needed, and was only
</em><br>
<em> &gt; technological equal to the sooners rather than enough superior to set up
</em><br>
<em> &gt; barriers that would stop sooners from encroaching.  Suppose, for
</em><br>
<p>Huh? Policing agency? Relativistic latency prevents you from synching
<br>
action, and you need massive presence to enforce decisions, whether
<br>
global or local.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; instance, that there is a sort of Vingean relative slowness bubble
</em><br>
<em> &gt; around us until we seem mature enough to venture out into the broader
</em><br>
<em> &gt; universe.  The bubble would make operations unprofitable for those who
</em><br>
<p>We're talking about real physics, not science fiction physics. If
<br>
inner areas of galaxies are sterile, it is due to other mechanisms.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; might be tempted to not respect the local nursery space.  But I would
</em><br>
<em> &gt; actually suggest that any forces that may be have a mutual agreement to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; abide by certain rules and do not let new races out and about until they
</em><br>
<em> &gt; make the same agreement and can be trusted to keep it.    I would expect
</em><br>
<em> &gt; much more advanced species to have much more advanced ways of sealing
</em><br>
<em> &gt; such a mutual agreement than simple brute force and hauling one another
</em><br>
<em> &gt; before magistrates. 
</em><br>
<p>You anthromorphize a lot. Lots of hidden assumptions guarantee a bogus 
<br>
scenario.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt; The key technology that would make a difference would be an ability
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; to project force out farther and faster than reproducing colonists
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; could move.  But it is hard to imagine such a technology.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Well, if the colonies are moving at less than c and there is a means of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; communication at c or better and policing mechanisms have been deployed
</em><br>
<em> &gt; throughout the protected spaces (at least), then it is not that terribly
</em><br>
<p>You can't protect the space other than being there with sufficient
<br>
infrastructure to intercept and outgun intruders. Assuming how much
<br>
infrastructure you need, it is hard to miss such presence, and it is
<br>
not obvious that more advanced (and nonexpansive?!) species can cast
<br>
their invisible protective veil faster than the fast dumb brutes.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; difficult.  Forget the communication.  Just have local intelligence
</em><br>
<em> &gt; mechanisms on guard duty that are sufficiently powerful to deter any
</em><br>
<em> &gt; foolish enough to break the agreements.  
</em><br>
<p>If you're that powerful to brush off pioneers, you don't have
<br>
to. Because you're sitting at the center of a rapidly expanding
<br>
bubble. You're then the enemy. 
<br>
<p>If you can expand, you will. If you can't or won't, you're irrelevant, 
<br>
because no one is ever going to interact with you. Hence either Rare
<br>
Earth, or the Zoo.
