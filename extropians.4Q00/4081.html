<p>
Okay, the earlier post was out of hand.  Fortunately I didn't send the several
<br>
pages that had been written before that.  So I simply trimmed down to about
<br>
as uninflamatory language as I could, and sent without thinking to try and
<br>
make the point a little more clearly.
<br>
<p>I am simply amazed, however, at the amount of shoddy thinking I'm seeing about
<br>
politics and the way various political outcomes affect a number of things that
<br>
one might think important here.  
<br>
<p>Of course, the really irritating thing that brought this on is the way that
<br>
people CONTINUE to pillory Gore for things that he never actually said.  He
<br>
never said that he invented the internet - you can go through news archives 
<br>
to try and find an attribution made directly by Mr. Gore, and not the mis-
<br>
representations that followed suit.  This uproar over the speech is another 
<br>
thing in the same vein.  I would challenge you to say something, anything,
<br>
so long as it is coherent, that had not been said or written by someone else
<br>
at some point in the history of language.  Additionally, it is well-known that 
<br>
sometimes a particular phrasing or concept can make a strong impression upon
<br>
a reader, unconsciously influencing something they may write at a later date.
<br>
<p>In the interests of fairness, there MAY be a bit of plagiarism involved here.
<br>
I'm fairly certain it is (a) not provable, nor (b) really valid.  Also, in an
<br>
age where speechwriters handle most public discourse, one can't necessarily
<br>
on the face of it attribute these words to Mr. Gore.  Though, unlike a certain
<br>
President-elect, Mr. Gore does write much of his own material, and it comes off 
<br>
as lucid if a bit staid.
<br>
<p>I forgot - Mr. Gore doesn't get any benefit of the doubt.  Mr. Bush has all 
<br>
that.  Why else would so many people who claim to be futurist oriented would
<br>
cast out the technocrat who has worked through much of his proven legislative
<br>
career (unlike a certain limited-experience executive with little to any 
<br>
public-record experience on anything) supporting technological causes, in favor
<br>
of someone who would throw money raided from taxpayers (not my rhetoric, but
<br>
the rhetoric I see here all the time about taxation of any kind) at faith-
<br>
based (church) organizations with a deathist, reactionary agenda that will,
<br>
probably sooner than later, come to a head against extropian values?  Or 
<br>
does it have to do with being bought off by the bribe of a large tax-cut that 
<br>
will not benefit many of the people here on this list?
<br>
<p>I have serious doubts about Mr. Bush's committment to expanding possibilities
<br>
of any kind, unless of course you happen to be wealthy, heterosexual, and 
<br>
religious.  What little public record he does have seems to indicate an 
<br>
indifferent manager, a person with managed to parlay his only real asset (his
<br>
last name and the connections thus) into the highest office in the US.  I do
<br>
not see his committment to telecommunications technology (Mr. Gore was a 
<br>
staunch supporter of the ARPAnet project through a large portion of his 
<br>
legislative career), to space exploration, to medical research, or even to 
<br>
extending tax credits for research expenses.  Mr. Bush was an alcoholic, and 
<br>
may or may not have done cocaine in his youth - all that has been forgiven, 
<br>
because people change.  Mr. Gore wrote a book about environmentalism back when
<br>
the two sides were either arch-alarmist or in denial, but he will be buried 
<br>
by that book because it's proven that he will come into our homes with 
<br>
soldiers deputized by a reappointed Ms. Reno to take away our internal 
<br>
combustion engines without any sort of recompense or alternative, dooming us
<br>
all to horseback and bicycle.
<br>
<p>I am frankly surprised at the fact that these points don't even seem to be 
<br>
considered - but then again politics in the US has become an article of faith 
<br>
and morality.  For all the talk about runnign the country more like a 
<br>
business, there is a ringing endosement for the one with the least experience 
<br>
on the job - and who has often avoided laying out specifics of what direction
<br>
he would take.
<br>
<p>And worst of all, the real difference between the two comes down to a matter
<br>
of degree.  If Al Gore is a socialist for defending Medicare, et al, why then
<br>
is Bush not pilloried for taking the same stands, simply with the numbers 
<br>
changed a bit, and often to a lesser degree?  This isn't the reductionist
<br>
rhetoric of the Gingrivh Revolution (tm), but the incremental coopting and
<br>
&quot;triangulation&quot; pioneered by the right's favorite pol to hate, Bill Clinton.
<br>
<p>I will give Bush a chance to govern, and maybe he will prove me wrong.  It 
<br>
would have been nice to have these concerns addressed before the election, but
<br>
it seems that that is not what elections are for anymore.  They're instead 
<br>
opportunities to smile, kiss babies, spend money and look cute and not _too_
<br>
smart.  Elections aren't about the future; the future is what happens after we
<br>
pick the most likeable person.  It's just like voting for a class president.
<br>
<p>In the California senate race, there were two candidates facing off - Diane
<br>
Feinstein, Democrat, and Tom Campbell, Republican.  They both had solid stands
<br>
on issues, they articulated many of them, and both had records to choose from.
<br>
Most people will think I supported Feinstein.  Think again.  I felt the better
<br>
leader would have been Campbell, in part because of his stand on the War on 
<br>
Some Drugs, and his support of personal freedom.  (Feinstein never met a gun
<br>
control law she didn't like, or an expansion of police powers she didn't like,
<br>
either).
<br>
<p>This is why partisanship is such a bad thing.  I guess I was disappointed to
<br>
find this particular virulent strain of political fundamentalism amongst 
<br>
intelligent people who have an avowed interest and investment in the future.
<br>
<p>We'll see what the next four years brings.  I hope to be proven wrong.

<p>All hail His Accidency, King George the Second!
