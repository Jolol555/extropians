been put onto DVD.  I've vowed to not buy any more analog VHS tapes if I can

it.

<p><em>&gt; Everybody likes 2001, Alien, T1/T/2 and Blade Runner so I'll just talk 
</em><br>
about 
<br>
<em>&gt; some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the lesser known movies that I think are gems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  * Forbidden Planet: Corny dialogue and poor acting can't stop this from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    a  terrific movie, because it has one of the best story premises ever 
</em><br>
put 
<br>
<em>&gt; on film.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    People land on a planet and investigate why half a million years ago an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alien race
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   that was advancing technologically at a accelerating pace mysteriously 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disappeared
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   overnight. This may sound like familiar territory but remember the movie 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   about the singularity  way back in 1956.  State of the art  special 
</em><br>
effects 
<br>
<em>&gt; for its day,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   and not bad even for today. Also it was the first movie ever made with an 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; all electronic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   musical score, and it's  aged well, it still sounds properly creepy. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However if they ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   remake it I hope  they dump  the very  last scene, that sucked. Why does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the object
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   of wonder always  have to blow up at the end?
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this.  In fact, I get out my copy of FP about once a year and 
<br>
marvel at how good it was.  FP was one of the first attempts to make a big 
<br>
budget science fiction movie that had a good deal of &quot;depth&quot; in both its plot 
<br>
(which is, as I'm sure you know, a re-working of Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest&quot; 
<br>
and in the working out of its technology.  A lot of it seems awfully quaint 
<br>
today but, viewed from the time when it was made, it's very good.  Plus, Ann 
<br>
Francis looks pretty darned good in those extraterrestrial tennis dresses she 
<br>
wears and it's weird to see Leslie Nielsen from his days as a &quot;serious&quot; 
<br>
Hollywood man.  Finally, the movie created all the archetypes for the setting 
<br>
and characters of Star Trek, so it has an important place in the development 
<br>
of the genre of video SF for that reason alone.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  * The Forbin Project: Came out about 1970.  Great story, great dialogue,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    great acting, great sets, great music, it's a mystery to me why nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    knows about this masterpiece. The best part is the ending, it's exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    what it should be, but not what you're expecting.
</em><br>
<p>Wow - I'd forgotten about this.  It was a really good movie and quite 
<br>
imaginative for a film of its time in terms of thinking about 
<br>
super-intelligence.  The scene where Colossus establishes a link with its 
<br>
Russian counterpart gave me the willies when I first saw it.  Wasn't there a 
<br>
sequel set in the years following the establishment of world hegemony by the 
<br>
computer? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  * The Lathe of Heaven: Made by PBS about 20 years ago. I thought it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    excellent but Isaac Asimov hated it. I agree with his criticism of one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brief
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    line of dialogue but that wasn't enough to ruin the movie for me, I 
</em><br>
still 
<br>
<em>&gt; like it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    The move just came out on video after being unavailable and stuck in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     copyright hell for 2 decades.
</em><br>
<p>Another good pick.  I have a copy of this, as well (one of the first things I 
<br>
taped on my first VCR).  Have any of LeGuin's other works ever been filmed?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  * Defending Your Life: A fantasy comedy, and a very funny one. I kept 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    of Tipler's Omega Point. It was made 5 or 6 years ago so you can probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    find it on video.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm - this one falls outside the pale of &quot;SF&quot; for me.  It seems more a work 
<br>
of &quot;imaginative fiction&quot; - not &quot;fantasy&quot;, but more like the genre that 
<br>
includes things like Kafka and &quot;Fearless&quot; (see below). . . Plus, anything 
<br>
with Albert Brooks is worthwhile spending time on.  Trivia points for this 
<br>
one: What's Albert Brooks' real name?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  * Fearless: Not Science Fiction at all, just the story of a man who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confronts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    mortality and survives a airplane crash. Maybe I'm reading too much into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    but I thought I could see some &gt;H ideas, and if not, it's still a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excellent  movie.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    It's a few years old and on video.
</em><br>
<p>Wow - I agree with the impression you had.  This is a very Zen movie and also 
<br>
very well done.  It's also pretty powerful for someone like me who spends a 
<br>
LOT of time on airplanes.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  *Being John Malkovich: Deals  with qualia, identity, and immortality, not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   you see every day, especially in a very funny comedy.  No fancy special 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   just first rate writing acting and direction.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed 100%  One of the smartest and funniest movies ever made.  The rare 
<br>
exception like this movie shows that American film culture CAN create a 
<br>
thoughtful masterpiece from time to time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  * The Thirteenth Floor: Came out at the same time as The Matrix and has 
</em><br>
the 
<br>
<em>&gt; same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     basic premise, it's not as spectacular visually and not nearly as well 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known, but may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     be a better movie.
</em><br>
<p>Also agreed 100%.  By far the best of the &quot;VR&quot; flicks.
<br>
<p>And now for some other titles we've overlooked in our film reviews:
<br>
<p>&quot;Omega Man&quot;:  Pretty good adventure SF film.  I get a kick out of the scene 
<br>
where Heston looks at the yellowing calendar from the &quot;future&quot; (when the film 
<br>
was made) and it shows the year of the bio-disaster to have been something 
<br>
like 1976.
<br>
<p>&quot;THX-1138&quot;:  Great cast and an example of doing more with less (I think I 
<br>
recall that the entire budget for this film was something like $30,000).  
<br>
This one actually belongs near the top of my &quot;Social Science Fiction&quot; film 
<br>
list.
<br>
<p>&quot;Things to Come&quot;:  Well worth watching as an exercise in futurism and 
<br>
idealism, and also displaying some impressive special effects for its time.  
<br>
Although I wouldn't say it makes it near the top of my &quot;best of&quot; list, it's 
<br>
one everyone should see.  (Maybe my familiarity with it - I've watched it a 
<br>
number of times - makes up for not having seen &quot;Solaris&quot; . . .)
