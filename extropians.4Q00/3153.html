<p><em>&gt; I am arguing in favor of selecting out a representative stock of humans

<em>&gt; A genetic Ponzi scheme is what I was talking about--too obliquely, it

<p>Hmmm, well, I think some passive sampling should come up with
<br>
statistically significant data, by comparing, say, offspring of
<br>
residents of silicon valley, redmond, and other high tech havens with
<br>
pennsylvania dutch country and other areas of high concentration of
<br>
primitivists.
