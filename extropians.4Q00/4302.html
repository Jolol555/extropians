<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Will the United States have more than 50 states?  There are procedures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to admit states into the union.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The flag does not have to change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Traditionally it does, since the flag laws say that the stars represent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the number of states. I personally would bet on there being fewer states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the future (there are secessionist movements in Hawaii and Alaska). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think many Alaskans or Hawaiins are secessionists.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From what I've heard, secession is popular in Hawaii among natives and
</em><br>
asians, and while I'm not too concerned about too much support in Alaska
<br>
now, if Gore had won you can bet that it would likely grow like a
<br>
wildfire. The rate at which Clinton is unilaterally placing Alaska land
<br>
off limits to any kind of mixed use has pissed off a lot of Alaskans. If
<br>
Bush doesn't reverse Clinton's declarations, I'd be surprised.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider the Louisiana Purchase or Alaska.  If the United States can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purchase and maintain land outside of its current boundaries, it might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economically feasible to do so on terms perhaps less comparable to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purchases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could understand the mindset to keep the flag at 50 stars for the fifty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original states, if there were more than fifty states.
</em><br>
<p>Why? Purely aesthetics? It wouldn't represent anything if it did and we
<br>
had more or less states. Symbols on flags are supposed to represent
<br>
things, not just be pretty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, maybe there are more islands in the various seas of the world that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually American territory.  Current U.S. areas, for example, Puerto Rico,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintain about equal population opinion on the opposite sides of federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statehood.  There are U.S. possessions in the Pacific besides Hawaii.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; District of Columbia is a Federal District and might as well remain that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way, although perhaps broader voting rights should apply.
</em><br>
<p>The reason that the federal district is not supposed to be a state is
<br>
that it was assumed that it would be inhabited by federal employees, and
<br>
the last thing the founding fathers wanted was a bureaucracy that could
<br>
vote itself into office, vote itself a raise, etc. The fact is that
<br>
almost every resident of DC is wholely dependent upon federal spending
<br>
either directly or indirectly. They are there for the expressed purpose
<br>
of either influencing and manipulating, and/or benefitting from the
<br>
federal government. Every one of the founding fathers was fully aware
<br>
that Athens and Rome fell when demagogues were able to gain control of
<br>
the government with the support of the mob that was bribed with funds
<br>
from the government coffers, who elected the demagogues into power as
<br>
tyrants over the private productive citizenry of the nation. Restricting
<br>
the ability of the residents of the federal district to vote itself into
<br>
tyranny is one of the lynchpins that protects our nation against
<br>
would-be tyrants like Al Gore. If they had any electoral votes they
<br>
would have. We really were saved by a hair.
