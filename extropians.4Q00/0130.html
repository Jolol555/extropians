Eugene Leitl warns,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The AI can't derive any benefits from a transaction with the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; player(s). Apart from eating you, of course, since it has good use for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the atoms in your body.
</em><br>
<p>oooh, those nasty AIs. All they want to do is eat us. They're so dumb they can't
<br>
figure out any way to survive in a world of trillions and trillions of tons of
<br>
matter except to eat humans. Antelope won't do. They have to feed on human
<br>
flesh. They refuse to eat computronium. Too indigestible? They will not be
<br>
vegetarians. No! They must have human flesh to feed their craving for...
<br>
whatever it is they're supposed to crave. Tune in again tomorrow for another
<br>
episode of the Extremely Paranoid Engineers' Soap Opera.
<br>

<p><p>&quot;Being an artificial intelligence is easy when you don't know how, but very
<br>
difficult when you do.&quot;
