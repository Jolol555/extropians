<em> &gt; Dr. Hughes, I hope you don't lose respect for me after I say this, but in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; my opinion, this is yet another thinly veiled attack from the growing
</em><br>
<em> &gt; luddite lobby
</em><br>
<p>Well, I asked Bruce Gagnon about this  (you can listen at
<br>
<a href="http://www.changesurfer.com/eventhorizon/shows.html">http://www.changesurfer.com/eventhorizon/shows.html</a>), and he stoutly denied
<br>
that the Mobilization is anti-space. In fact, some of the organizational
<br>
members are space and astronomical organizations in the Third World who are
<br>
simply afraid that space is going to be the sole preserve of the U.S. Space
<br>
Command, and used to consolidate Pax Americana.
<br>
<p>I also recommend the interview I did with John Pike (interview on the 1998
<br>
page), the chief researcher and activist on space issues at the Federation
<br>
of American Scientists, not noted as a Luddite front organization. Pike and
<br>
the FAS have been fighting SDI/BMD and other initiatives to weaponize space
<br>
precisely because it pours federal money down a rat hole, and could be
<br>
better spent on real space work.
<br>
<p>Its not a serious approach to jump on the other side of every supposedly
<br>
binary question when you find Greenpeace on your side. I already know you
<br>
don't think that way because of our discussions of a serious transhuman
<br>
genetics policy that acknowledges serious potential genetics problems, and
<br>
proposes serious regulatory solutions, without falling into the trap of
<br>
techno-utopianism. The campaign to defend the space program, and direct it
<br>
from military to peaceful, scientific and commercial purposes is similar.
<br>
<p>And there is a very small, but real, risk that a nuclear payload on a space
<br>
launch could blow up and spread radioactive isotopes through the atmosphere
<br>
at a high altitude. The risks may be reducible to make the cost-benefit
<br>
analysis worth the risk. But it is not crazy for people to worry that NASA
<br>
and the military may be underestimating their own capacity to fuck-up
<br>
(remember the Challenger and two failed Mars missions, to name a few).
<br>
<p><em> &gt;  The military has
</em><br>
<em> &gt; long been and still is a major driving force for developing technologies
</em><br>
<em> &gt; for affordable exploration and development of space
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and wars have been a major stimulus to technological innovation. But I
<br>
don't think people should have to enlist to get to space, and I don't think
<br>
military space missions are the best way to advance space exploration. I
<br>
would prefer to pursue non-military avenues to technological innovation and
<br>
space. I think its been proven pretty decisively that given the same amount
<br>
of invested capital, investments in commercial and scientific research and
<br>
development produces more than investment in military R &amp; D.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;  &quot;So while we're protesting against military use of space, lets also
</em><br>
<em> &gt; demand larger tax breaks and fewer restrictions on private companies
</em><br>
<em> &gt; seeking to develop space for peaceful commercial uses.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you think a person's views of the appropriate economic motivations
<br>
for space industry has anything to do with &quot;Luddism&quot;? There is a difference
<br>
between correlation and causation.
<br>
<p>I promise you this - there are very few libertarians on the Boards of
<br>
Lockheed Martin or Boeing. Yes, they'll take tax breaks and fewer regs, but
<br>
they sure as hell want to keep the government involved in the space
<br>
business.
<br>
<p>Deregulation won't get us to space any quicker. All aerospace concerns are
<br>
driven by profit, and they don't see much to be made in colonizing the moon
<br>
or Mars.
<br>
<p>If you want to support nascent space industries, why not prime the pump by
<br>
giving them lucrative contracts to pursue scientific research? I'm sure they
<br>
would prefer that to simply deregulating who gets to fire off rockets, which
<br>
is not such an attractive idea for national security reasons in the first
<br>
place.
<br>
<p>If you are interested in a serious, and decidedly pro-profit, space plan,
<br>
look at ThinkMars [<a href="http://www.thinkmars.net/thinkmars2.html">http://www.thinkmars.net/thinkmars2.html</a>]. I interviewed
<br>
the aspiring CEO of this venture which is trying to collect the capital to
<br>
get to Mars [<a href="http://www.changesurfer.com/eventhorizon/shows/1999.html">http://www.changesurfer.com/eventhorizon/shows/1999.html</a>]. And
<br>
he made one thing very clear: any venture to get to Mars cannot rely on the
<br>
for-profit motivations of industrial investors alone. They are looking for
<br>
at least half of the investments to be underwritten by federal dollars. And
<br>
they are not planning on planting any anti-Iraqi missile batteries or
<br>
running reconnaissance on the Chinese.
