I have seen concern on this list that aerobic exercise, by producing
<br>
oxidative stress, could actually *decrease* longevity if taken to extremes.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I have two comments on this:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
1) This notion is not supported by epidemeological data.  In studies of the
<br>
death risk of distance runners, for example, number of miles run per day
<br>
correlated with likelihood of surviving the study.  Since the average
<br>
distance runner is well exceeding 30 minutes of cardio exercise per day,
<br>
this supports the notion that even large amounts of aerobic exercise
<br>
increase rather than decrease longevity.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Also note that several studies on CR in rats have found that 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Exercise does not offset the benefits of CR by producing increased
<br>
oxidative stress; and 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The effects of exercise and CR are not additive in rats; and 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Exercising rats tend to outlive CR rats 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
References:  McCarter (97), Holloszy (97), Holloszy (98)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(See especially the McCarter paper which shows exercising rats outliving CR
<br>
rats.)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
2) The 9 November Nature Insight section on ageing engages in some
<br>
speculation on the need for acute oxidative stress to build up oxidative
<br>
stress resistance.  In particular it theories that one mechanism via which
<br>
exercise extends mean longevity is by producing an oxidative stress on
<br>
cells that builds a resistance to future oxidative stresses.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
To support this notion, the Nature review article cites papers
<br>
demonstrating a correlation between &quot;conditioning stresses&quot; (heat and
<br>
radiation) and increased mean longevity in C. Elegans and Drosophila.
<br>
