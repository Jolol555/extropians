----- Original Message -----
<br>
From: &quot;Nicq MacDonald&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:namacdonald@stthomas.edu?Subject=Re:%20Greens&In-Reply-To=&lt;00d101c050d4$d0199440$d2147318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">namacdonald@stthomas.edu</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>I guess, when
<br>
<em>&gt; it comes down to it, I'm just a centrist- I believe in whatever doesn't
</em><br>
mess
<br>
<em>&gt; things up, and I don't believe in right wing or left wing utopian
</em><br>
scenarios.
<br>
<em>&gt; I side with whoever offers me a little temporary meaning in my life, until
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; grow disillusioned and sick of the idea (and promptly move on).  Sorry,
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; only thing I'm a true believer in is relativism- I'm a skeptic that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken his skepticism to an absurd level for the sheer absurdity of it (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm a philosophy student, no less!).
</em><br>
<p><p>I wouldn't say that's absurd Nicq.  I myself practice very fluid
<br>
philosophy-- I personally find it confers tremendous advantages, but keep in
<br>
mind I have a very high tolerance for ambiguity.
<br>
<p>It -can- be frustrating at times (for myself, and others: much potential for
<br>
ideological conflict, dogmatism is ceaselessly annoying) but less so for the
<br>
nimble relativist: there are many paths and many truths.
<br>
<p>I'm sure there are many advantages as well to having a concrete belief
<br>
structure, some of them (comfort in the universe) I'm not particularly
<br>
interested in, others (ideological structure bringing focus to real world
<br>
actions,) can be manufactured out of logical thin air.
<br>
<p>Skepticism is actually quite interesting when taken to an absurd level-- it
<br>
must necessarily be applied to itself.
<br>
<p>Challenge everything, wipe the canvass clean, and then create a functional
<br>
and optimal reality matrix for yourself.  If you don't have anything better
<br>
to do, here's what you should be doing:
<br>
<p>1) Strip away limiting ideological garbage.
<br>
2) Understand your personal power.
<br>
3) Understand your environment.
<br>
4) Do.
<br>
<p>(What works for me: &quot;You are a human on planet Earth, and you kick ass.
<br>
There *is* a way.  Do it now.&quot;)
<br>
<p><p>Others will disagree, but: reality is, after all, a game.  There are some
<br>
rules you have to follow, but -many- you don't: try to recognize all the
<br>
rules that you or your society have manufactured that arbitrarily restrict
<br>
your behavior and start erasing them to your advantage.
<br>
<p>One pearl of wisdom: In the face of meaninglessness, and when in doubt,
<br>
employ compassion.  Other game players will come to your rescue.
