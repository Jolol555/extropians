<p><em>&gt;I think also that Nader is helping too, by making low-polling
</em><br>
third party candidates more credible.  He is a well known figure
<br>
and probably the most attractive ideologically for many in the
<br>
media, plus his &quot;spoiler&quot; role in some states has helped him
<br>
get coverage.  Given that Browne and
<br>
Buchanan are not that far below Nader (1% to his 5% or so), the
<br>
light cast on Nader gets reflected on the others somewhat.&lt;
<br>
<p>I'm impressed by Nader's firm stance - it's a fine strategy for
<br>
the future elections, however I disagree with much of his platform.
<br>
&nbsp;I have watched this party make headway over the past years,
<br>
and it does shed an associative light on others who are up against
<br>
the mighty 2-party players.
<br>
<p>The Greens have become well organized and determined.  Nader
<br>
is a visible figure and his voice is respected if not for content,
<br>
then certianly for longevity.  He has a couple of tireless workers,
<br>
such as Michael Finstein, who gets on television at every chance
<br>
possible.  Where the Greens have grown from their inhouse termoil,
<br>
they seems to have put a jump-start on their organization and
<br>
media presence.
