<p><em>&gt;Max and other weight trainers,
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;What would you recommend for someone who wants to start light
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weight training in terms of equipment, frequency of workouts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;duration of workouts, supplements, etc?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm 40, about 220 lbs at 6'--so bulking isn't much of a concern.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm in decent shape because I do karate regularly. I live in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sticks, so working out at a gym isn't an option.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Is it safe to work out with free weights without a partner, or do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I need to stretch rubber bands or something?
</em><br>
<p>My $.25 Dave.
<br>
<p>Buy yourself a good bench, one that also allows for inclines is
<br>
nice, you can probably find a used one in the newspaper. Then all
<br>
you need is some weights. Since your alone, I'd buy individual
<br>
(hand) barbells. Pick a pair that you can just curl about 8-10
<br>
times to start. These will suit for a variety of exercises. You can
<br>
buy adjustables, but you'll find you use them less.
<br>
<p>Arnold's book on bodybuilding is updated and re-released in
<br>
softcover, it should be readily available. It's THE bible and is
<br>
full of good advise on all aspects of weightlifting including
<br>
nutrition. A must have.
<br>
<p>Skip rubberbands and other gimicks, working out with hand barbells
<br>
alone is safe, do not use a standard (York) benchpress alone.
