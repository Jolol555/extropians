<em>&gt; I wonder how long this `legend' has existed? One of Robert
</em><br>
Heinlein's
<br>
<em>&gt; earliest stories, `Lost Legacy' (originally `Lost Legion', 1941)
</em><br>
used that
<br>
<em>&gt; idea; I wonder if he invented it, or if it was prevalent among
</em><br>
Theosophists
<br>
<em>&gt; and other devotees of the arcana? (Heinlein, like his pal Elron,
</em><br>
seemed to
<br>
<em>&gt; know an unholy amount about magic and the like.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Damien Broderick
</em><br>
<p>Amara Graps reminded me that this info is available on the Net. The
<br>
Mt. Shasta Legend is a very old one, and has been connected to
<br>
stories told by indigenous peoples (Siskiyou, Klamath, and Shasta).

Frederick Spencer Oliver in an 1894 novel A Dweller on Two Planets,
<br>
set in a Utopian Atlantis, speaks of Lemuria, a community of sages
<br>
established on Mount Shasta to preserve the wisdom of the ancients,
<br>
and a subterranean temple located inside a hollow chamber of the
<br>
mountain. A 1932 article in the Los Angeles Times Star claimed to
<br>
have observed Lemurians holding sacred night-lit ceremonies on the
<br>
mountain's slopes. Though the article was proved to be a fraud, this
<br>
did not deter the formation of a Lemurian Fellowship in 1936, which
<br>
has further developed the idea of Shasta's inner mountain temple to
<br>
include a great stone door in the mountain and a series of
<br>
passageways leading to an entire inhabited underground realm.
<br>
Lemurian 'adepts' are in there, it is said, and occasionally come
<br>
out. They have been sighted performing rituals, dressed in long
<br>
white robes.

In 1932 some Rosicrucians popularized the belief that Shasta was the
<br>
home of the Lemurians. Their original home, once a continent in the
<br>
Pacific Ocean, is said to have been destroyed by volcanic eruption.
<br>
They are supposedly so spiritually advanced that they are able to
<br>
transform themselves from material to spiritual levels at will. They
<br>
are thought to work their power through crystals.

Legend proclaims that Mt. Shasta in Northern California was the last
<br>
refuge of the survivors of the lost continent of Lemuria. Here, the
<br>
tales relate, the Lemurians established a secret colony preserving
<br>
their ancient customs. The author shows with an overlaid map
<br>
identical outlines of the continent of Mu that covers the regions
<br>
knows as California, Nevada &amp; Utah, where ancient caves containing
<br>
Lemurian treasures were discovered. According to tradition, many
<br>
Lemurians migrated to the northeastern part of their continent when
<br>
it became apparent that it would meet with a devastating cataclysm,
<br>
and took refuge in Mt. Shasta, which stood on a section of the
<br>
continent which eventually survived the cataclysms which submerged
<br>
the main body of Lemuria.
