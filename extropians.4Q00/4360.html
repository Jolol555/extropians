<p>Child's play.  Miracles of Christ?  No biggie.  I'm looking forward to

practical levitation and near teleportation myself.  And having as much

being, a techno-mage would be good fun for a while.  Wiping death except
<br>
for from accident or violence (if even then) out of human consideration
<br>
would be a HUGE high.  
<br>
<p>A few decades ahead of yourself?  I doubt it.  It would probably be a
<br>
good idea to start thinking in terms of what you would and would not do
<br>
with such power and how people would deal with this power and how, if
<br>
needed, you and others might want/need to change to deal with such
<br>
things well and reasonably benignly.  A lot of this will come much
<br>
sooner than you think.
