<p>Very interesting idea, Mike!  I am currently considering a job as an 
<br>
industry analyst.  One of my primary functions would be not only to 
<br>
comment on technology, but to predict the future of technology.  I 
<br>
likewise am concerned about the bias and downright poor accuracy of 
<br>
most predictions.  I have suddenly found myself interested in trying 
<br>
to apply a more scientific method to predictions.  Any discussion on 
<br>
this topic would be of great interest to me!
