<p>This is vintage Kevin Warwick.  He is a media darling, and as such gets a
<br>
lot of press for anything he does.  Despite the fact that he is a Professor
<br>
of Cybernetics, it bothers me greatly to see such a potentially valuable
<br>
line of study as cybernetics be equated with the amateur commercialism
<br>
Warwick represents.  In the long run, people such as Warwick will likely do
<br>
as much damage to the public perception of futurist technology as Luddites.
