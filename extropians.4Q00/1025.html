<em>      &gt;&gt;Me:
</em><br>
<em>      &gt;&gt; Actually, atom for atom tritium is 3 or 4 times as expensive as U-235
</em><br>
<em>      &gt;&gt;or Pu -239, pound for pound figure 2 to 3 hundred times as expensive.

<p>Eugene Leitl &lt;<a href="mailto:eugene.leitl@lrz.uni-muenchen.de?Subject=Re:%20Future%20baby%20nukes%20(boffin-sized?)&In-Reply-To=&lt;000d01c0345f$bc3c9bc0$19b84d0c@flrjs&gt;">eugene.leitl@lrz.uni-muenchen.de</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Sure, but I can get tritium much easier than fissibles,
</em><br>
<p>Not enough to get a bomb you can't. I'll bet  the entire world supply of
<br>
non military tritium doesn't have the explosive power of a few tons of
<br>
TNT, and tritium is one of the most expensive substances on earth.
<br>
I don't know that a pure fusion bomb is even possible, if it is it
<br>
certainly won't be something some bright teenager could build in their
<br>
garage, no so a fission bomb. If you're in the mood to kill a few million
<br>
people there are much easier ways to do it than with a pure fusion bomb.
<br>
<p>As for materials, there are already thousands of tons of plutonium and
<br>
U235 in warehouses that nobody knows what to do with. If you were to
<br>
visit such a place and your fingers were a bit sticky who would know, you
<br>
can't audit it to the ounce, stuff is always getting lost. Even better, forget
<br>
about materials and steal an entire bomb, go to Russia and buy one of
<br>
the security guards a bottle of vodka. If the bombs were made of gold or
<br>
even silver the security would be much tighter.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt; And the mass defect of fusion is a lot larger than that  of fission.
</em><br>
<p>I'd have to look it up but I think it's only about 2 or 3 times larger, no more.
<br>
Two reasons a H bomb is over a 1000 times as powerful as a fission bomb:
<br>
<p>1) You can make lots of the explosive material, tritium, very cheaply and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instantly from the lithium blanket around the fission trigger.
<br>
<p>2) There is no pre detonation problem with lithium or with the (also cheap) U238
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jacket, so there is no upper limit to the size of an H bomb as there is with a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bomb. You can make an H bomb as large as you want and it won't empty
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your bank account either.
