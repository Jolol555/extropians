<p>
A large number of these questions I think definitely have a place - however 
<br>
I'm not so sure about some (see later:)
<br>
<p>Questions I agree should be dealt with in a FAQ:
<br>
<em>&gt;  - Are all extropians libertarian?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I saw the section on government, but this question should be in there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explicitly, and darn it, the word &quot;libertarian&quot; should be *mentioned*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that paragraph about beliefs extropians might have.)
</em><br>
<p>(comment concurred with as well)
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - When should &quot;extropy&quot;, &quot;Extropianism&quot;, etc. be capitalized?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - Do extropians support eugenics?
</em><br>
Comment on this:  I think &quot;Eugenics&quot; as a word in this case should be left
<br>
out in favor of something like &quot;germ-line genetic modification&quot; or something
<br>
similar.  The word &quot;eugenics&quot; leaves such a bad taste in people's mouths that
<br>
addressing it at all (save to specify that the historical justifications and
<br>
practices of eugenics have nothing to do with the modern science of human
<br>
genetics, much like ancient blood sacrifices for fertility have nothing to
<br>
do with modern scientific agriculture)
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - What do extropians think about &quot;genetically modified&quot; crops, foods,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    etc?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - What do extropians think about mysticism?
</em><br>
<p>This is where the dangerous ground begins to be tread.  I've written five 
<br>
different reasons why, and realized that each one of them would eventually
<br>
degenerate into flaming.  And I think that alone should make the point.  It
<br>
does not mean that we endorse such odd &quot;psuedo-theories&quot; as the healing
<br>
power of prayer, or &quot;creation science&quot;.  The personal, though, should remain
<br>
such.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd also like to see the FAQ become a resource to which we can refer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people when certain perennial debates crop up, and I'd be happy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; write a critically balanced answer or two if that would help.
</em><br>
<p>I admire the notion of trying to summarize past debates on these subjects,
<br>
but I've seen this done on other email lists and newsgroups for many years,
<br>
and the fact is that the peopel who already are here and have their own 
<br>
opinions on these subjects will continue to espouse them at a low level, 
<br>
subconsciously eliciting responses from newcomers who have not been in on 
<br>
these debates prior and who will 99% of the time not pause to read the FAQ 
<br>
or any other supportin documentation before replying and rehashing the same
<br>
arguement over and over again.  This is particularly dangerous in areas that
<br>
arouse strict partisan responses and emotions, such as the &quot;faith/belief&quot; 
<br>
question or the thrice-damned gun discussions.  
<br>
<p>Somethign that meets similar ideas might be a set of questions that would
<br>
describe extropian ideals as a series of positions on issues - things
<br>
like:
<br>
<p>Is it beneficial for people to live twice their current life expectancy at the
<br>
same or better quality?
<br>
<p>Are space habitats and permanent settlement off the earth possible and 
<br>
desireable?
<br>
<p>Should some scientific inquiry be stymied because of ite potentially upsetting
<br>
effect on society?
<br>
<p>Shoul dhuman beings be able to make genetic modifications to themselves and
<br>
their children?
<br>
<p>Other questions like this can be approached to present a constructive, rather
<br>
than detructive, view.  Rather than presenting an arguentative view on modern
<br>
issues (and one can say this with certainty: most extropians have diverse and 
<br>
strongly-held opinions on most major modern issues), a more forward-looking, 
<br>
futurist view can be expressed, focusing attention where it needs to be.
<br>
<p>Again, as usual, IMHO, YMMV, et al.
<br>
