</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quite possibly. Could it also be that the Montanan and Hampshirite share
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more common values, or think they do? Sure. I know what you are driving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at, but note that you said &quot;easier&quot;. Not &quot;a slam dunk&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Frankly most people I know don't know jack about cattle ranching or
<br>
mining. Pretty different cultures. I've also found that rural people
<br>
will tend to trust a 'city slicker' if they don't fit in previously
<br>
formed categories that equal 'con artist', while few city people would
<br>
distrust a rural person at all, though they may have prejudices about
<br>
them being quaint, simple, etc..
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I do freak petty socio/communo-fascists all the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, let's take two extreme examples of individualism, then something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that happened to me a couple years back:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Flash or print a concealed weapon in New Mexico, one of those rural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; places you and I both tend to like. Get arrested. Resist arrest and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; escape, claiming that your constitutional rights are being violated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Return to your home. Wait for the SWAT team and negotiators. I am not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying it's right, I am saying it happens; at some point, if you act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;weird&quot; enough, you will be presumed to be a danger to others and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be called a wacko. Even in Ojai.
</em><br>
<p>Resisting arrest and escape are dumb ideas in any event, and will get
<br>
you negative attention no matter where you go. Best to just sit it out
<br>
and kick their asses in the courtroom.
<br>
<p>A few months after the Carl Drega shooting spree in northern NH a few
<br>
years ago, a local was living temporarily on the Vermont side of the
<br>
river due to a marital dispute, and was seeking to renew his vehicle
<br>
registration at the City Hall here in Lebanon. The local clerk refused
<br>
to let him renew his registration because his only mailing address at
<br>
this point was in Vermont and was being highly uncooperative. His
<br>
response was,&quot;You people need to start being responsive to citizens, or
<br>
there will be more incidents like that one up north.&quot;
<br>
The clerk freaked and claimed that he made a death threat and called the
<br>
cops on him. When they tracked him down and arrested him, he was in
<br>
posession of a revolver that he legally owned. A recently passed gun
<br>
control law that had slipped in somewhere made it a crime to be in
<br>
posession of a gun when you are being arrested, which is obviously an
<br>
unconstitutional circumstance to be in. He fought the charges on the
<br>
death threat, and got them dismissed, then got the illegal posession law
<br>
overturned by the State Supreme Court as unconstitutional.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) After getting all proper permits for a public event from your local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socio/communo-fascists, undertake to perform a blood animal sacrifice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some medium-sized animal in your local (small) town square. Invite the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media. Invoke Cthulhu, and call for the destruction of all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christians value. Paint your self with and drink the blood, and offer it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to children to do the same. Still covered in blood, go to various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merchants offering the blood for wholesale as a miracle cure for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christianity. Wait for results. You might not be committed, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ga-ron-tee that the word &quot;crazy&quot; will be applied by some people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You were just being an individual; in the latter case, it was just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performance art. What is their problem?
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you were in fact violating local health ordinances, anybody
<br>
would have a problem with your behavior then. If, however, you were
<br>
performing it completely Kosher(TM), then nobody could rightly say much
<br>
agin' it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that is seems to be harder to freak country folk, at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superficially: &quot;Oh, that's just Jeb. Don't mind ol' Jeb, he just got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some WAYS about him.&quot; These people are talking about someone they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known from birth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You say you wouldn't do either of those things? Hey! Hel-looooo, shared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values!
</em><br>
<p>Read my trip report from last July on my Montana trip to the Rainbow
<br>
Gathering. Don't know if I included in the report, but one day a few of
<br>
us went into town on some errands and stopped at some taco joint for
<br>
lunch and to read the papers. Front page news was about the gathering,
<br>
and how local folks found them to be quite nice people if a little odd,
<br>
oddly dressed and a bit dirty, quite the contrary to all the scare
<br>
stories the Forest Service had tried to freak people out with prior to
<br>
anyone showing up. Of course, when an extra couple hundred thousand
<br>
bucks a day is being funnelled into your local economy, I'm sure people
<br>
will overlook lots of things, though I will say the national media makes
<br>
a far worse impression when they show up up here in New Hampshire for
<br>
the presidential debates and the primaries...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) But if you walk into a small community diner as a total unknown,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wearing no pants and a parka that doesn't quite cover what other people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish it did, after being up in the hill country where there ain't nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to care and you plumb forgot, plus you thought you *were* figleafed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect to be treated as a potential loony. I speak from personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience. Luckily, I was able to get congruent quickly enough that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was just invited to never return to that establishment. By about three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CHiPpies. And the waitress did not look happy, either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But hell, Mount Shasta Village is just as bad as NYC, right?
</em><br>
<p>You shocked em cause they couldn't decide if they were in a restaurant
<br>
or a livestock auction... ;-P
