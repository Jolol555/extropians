<p>Atom-Scale Research Gets Real
<br>
<p>Robert F. Service
<br>
<p>Nanotechnology has spawned useful new materials and impressive
<br>
technical feats. But the field's most grandiose dreams, and
<br>
nightmares, remain the stuff of fiction
<br>
<p>In September, speaking to an audience of prominent researchers and
<br>
government leaders at a meeting on the future impacts of
<br>
nanotechnology, Michael Crow crossed a familiar line. &quot;How many of you
<br>
have read The Diamond Age?&quot; the science policy expert and vice provost
<br>
of Columbia University in New York City asked his listeners. The book,
<br>
by science-fiction novelist Neal Stephenson, depicts a near-future
<br>
world in which advances in nanotechnology make it possible to build
<br>
essentially anything from scratch, atom by atom, leaving society to
<br>
sift through the cultural ramifications of limitless choices. In
<br>
response to Crow's question, a few hands fluttered in the air and
<br>
quickly dropped. These people, after all, were nanotechnology's
<br>
practitioners--not wide-eyed dreamers.
<br>
<p>Crow wasn't promoting the book as a prophecy. He mentioned it, he
<br>
says, to encourage researchers to think about their unique position at
<br>
the dawn of a field that most in the room agreed will be a force in
<br>
the coming century. But clearly his question touched a nerve. Since
<br>
its inception, nanotechnology has been dominated by fiction, both
<br>
unabashed hype and better grounded hope. Science-fiction writers have
<br>
dreamt up lush scenarios of life with nanosized robots that do
<br>
everything from building gleaming cities to reaming out clogged
<br>
coronary arteries. Meanwhile, some researchers have been hard at work
<br>
drawing impressive but equally fictional blueprints for arrays of tiny
<br>
gears and pistons that could form the foundation of nanomachines--if
<br>
anyone ever figures out how to assemble the thousands of atoms needed
<br>
to build them.
<br>
<p>This year, dystopian fiction came on the scene, as nanotech prophets
<br>
of doom made bold new pronouncements of nanotechnology's potential to
<br>
destroy humanity and called for either an end to research in the area
<br>
or new guidelines to ensure that researchers don't accidentally wipe
<br>
out life on the planet (see sidebar, p. 1526). &quot;Nanotechnology seems
<br>
to have this wonderful property of having the most extravagant
<br>
favorable and unfavorable predictions,&quot; says Edward Tenner, a
<br>
historian of science at Princeton University in New Jersey.
<br>
<p>In response, many researchers at the cutting edge of dealing with
<br>
matter on the near-atomic scale have become aggressively matter-
<br>
of-fact, squirming at the suggestion of cornucopian nanofactories or
<br>
even humbler mass-produced nanodevices. The nearby hurdles, they say,
<br>
are challenge enough. &quot;Nanotechnology is a vision, a hope to
<br>
manufacture on the length scale of a few atoms,&quot; says Don Eigler of
<br>
IBM's Almaden Research Center in the hills above San Jose,
<br>
California. For now, he says, &quot;nanotechnology doesn't exist.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yet even the most hard-headed nanoscientists must admit that their
<br>
minute world, by whatever name, is on the move. Advances in
<br>
manipulating nanosized materials have already led to improvements in
<br>
computer data storage, solar cells, and rechargeable
<br>
batteries. Computer disk drives alone--which rely on controlling the
<br>
thickness of various layers of material on the nanometer
<br>
scale--account for a multibillion-dollar market. The field's promise
<br>
has prompted the creation of about a dozen nanotech research centers
<br>
in U.S.  universities alone. The European Community runs several
<br>
programs in nanotechnology, including the Nano Network, which contains
<br>
18 member research centers working in nanomaterials synthesis. Japan,
<br>
Singapore, China, Australia, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and
<br>
Russia all support nanotechnology efforts.
<br>
<p>And there is more to come. Last month Congress approved the bulk of
<br>
the Clinton Administration's request for money to launch a new
<br>
National Nanotechnology Initiative. Next year the initiative will
<br>
spend some $423 million on nanoscience, with more sure to follow. In
<br>
Japan, nanotechnology funding is slated to jump 41% next year to $396
<br>
million. Several European countries are ramping up efforts as well.
<br>
<p>Some U.S. experts hope that the surge in funding will carry over to
<br>
bolster American research in the physical sciences as a whole. Whereas
<br>
Congress is 3 years into a 5-year effort to double biomedical research
<br>
funding at the National Institutes of Health, &quot;support for physical
<br>
sciences and engineering has been stagnant,&quot; says Tom Kalil, a White
<br>
House specialist on the economics of technology. &quot;We see
<br>
[nanotechnology] as a way [of] increasing support for physical
<br>
sciences and engineering.&quot;
<br>
<p>Richard Smalley, a Nobel Prize-winning chemist, thinks the emerging
<br>
field may even reverse the long slide in the number of new students
<br>
choosing careers in science, just as the space race inspired an
<br>
earlier generation. &quot;It was Sputnik that got me into science,&quot; Smalley
<br>
says. &quot;Of all the impacts of [nanotechnology's rise], the most
<br>
important impact--and one that I dearly hope will happen--will to be
<br>
to get more American girls and boys interested in science.&quot;
<br>
<p>All of this activity is leading to some rather grandiose
<br>
pronouncements. &quot;This is an area that can have a huge potential payoff
<br>
that can be as significant as the development of electricity or the
<br>
transistor,&quot; says Kalil.  And at a 1998 congressional hearing, Neal
<br>
Lane, the president's adviser for science and technology and former
<br>
National Science Foundation (NSF) director, stated, &quot;If I were asked
<br>
for an area of science and engineering that will most likely produce
<br>
the breakthroughs of tomorrow, I would point to nanoscale science and
<br>
engineering.&quot;
<br>
<p>But however promising nanotech's future may be, transforming it from
<br>
the world of fiction to reality will mean overcoming some daunting
<br>
obstacles. Beyond manipulating atoms, nanoscientists must perfect ways
<br>
to mass-produce nanosized objects and integrate them with the larger,
<br>
human-scale systems around them.  And they must do it while working in
<br>
an interdisciplinary field that requires new levels of cooperation
<br>
among different specialties, raising familiar challenges of herding
<br>
academic cats and coaxing them to march in lockstep.
<br>
<p>A new hammer
<br>
<p>Of course, nanotechnology--in the guise of nanoscale materials--has
<br>
already been around for a long time.  For the last 100 years, tire
<br>
companies have reinforced the rubber in car tires by adding nanosized
<br>
carbon particles, called carbon black. And living organisms from
<br>
bacteria to beetles rely on nanosized protein-based machines that do
<br>
everything from whipping flagella to flexing muscles.
<br>
<p>Today, the term &quot;nanotechnology&quot; refers most broadly to the use of
<br>
materials with nanoscale dimensions, a size range from 1 to 100
<br>
billionths of a meter, or nanometers. Because this range includes
<br>
everything from collections of a few atoms to those protein-based
<br>
motors, researchers in chemistry, physics, materials science, and
<br>
molecular biology all lay stake to some territory in the field. That
<br>
tends to make nanotechnology a scientific Rorschach blot: What it
<br>
includes depends on whom you ask.
<br>
<p>&quot;Nanotechnology is a wonderful umbrella term that takes into account
<br>
many things that we were doing before some very helpful tools came
<br>
along,&quot; says William Tolles, a nanotechnology consultant for the U.S.
<br>
Department of Defense. &quot;To a 5-year-old with a hammer, the world looks
<br>
like a nail,&quot; adds Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie Mellon
<br>
University in Pittsburgh, who studies the development of technology.
<br>
&quot;Nanotechnology is a hammer, and nanotechnologists are looking around
<br>
to see what they can hit with it.&quot;
<br>
<p>The development of that hammer was launched by a breakthrough in
<br>
manipulating atoms back in the early 1980s. In 1982, physicists
<br>
Heinrich Rohrer and Gerd Binnig of IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory in
<br>
Switzerland created a new type of microscope, called a scanning
<br>
tunneling microscope (STM), that is capable of imaging individual
<br>
atoms. By tracking the changes in a tiny electrical current from an
<br>
ultrasharp tip to atoms on a surface, Binnig and Rohrer's STM enabled
<br>
researchers, essentially, to feel their way along a surface at the
<br>
atomic level and create a computerized image of it atom by atom.
<br>
<p>Other imaging tools followed close behind. In 1985, Binnig teamed up
<br>
with Calvin Quate, an electrical engineer at Stanford University in
<br>
Palo Alto, California, to make an atomic force microscope, which
<br>
enabled them to image surfaces that do not conduct electricity. And
<br>
since then, versions of these microscopes have been developed to
<br>
pinpoint atoms' magnetic and chemical signatures.
<br>
<p>It wasn't long before researchers used their new tools to jump from
<br>
imaging atoms to manipulating them. In 1990, Eigler and Erhard
<br>
Schweizer, also of IBM's Almaden Research Center, used an STM to spell
<br>
out &quot;IBM&quot; with 35 xenon atoms atop a nickel surface. It was the first
<br>
time scientists had built something by manipulating individual
<br>
atoms. Since then, Eigler and colleagues have gone on to build a
<br>
series of atomic-scale corrals that reveal the wavelike nature of
<br>
atoms and their electrons for all to see. &quot;Seeing the electrons in
<br>
their quantum state seems to have had a larger psychological effect
<br>
than the bare bones of the research itself,&quot; Eigler says.
<br>
<p>Part of that psychological effect lay in convincing researchers that
<br>
they could build structures an atom at a time. It's an idea that
<br>
continues to spread. Last year, Wilson Ho, a chemist and physicist at
<br>
the University of California, Irvine, showed that he could use an STM
<br>
to help forge chemical bonds between iron atoms and carbon monoxide
<br>
molecules. Other researchers have used similar techniques to alter the
<br>
chemistry of silicon atoms on a surface, transforming them into a key
<br>
component of a transistor.
<br>
<p>Early advances have gone beyond manipulating atoms. Groundbreaking
<br>
work in materials synthesis has given researchers the ability to
<br>
control the size and shape of a wide variety of materials at the
<br>
nanoscale.  Along the way, researchers discovered that in many cases
<br>
the large surface-to-volume ratio of nanoscale materials gives them
<br>
unique characteristics not shared by their bulk-sized
<br>
cousins. Nanosized crystallites made from semiconductors such as
<br>
cadmium selenide, for example, fluoresce in different colors of light
<br>
as they change sizes. That's already made them a hot property for use
<br>
as fluorescent &quot;dyes&quot; in biology experiments, and several companies
<br>
are now racing to commercialize the technology.
<br>
<p>The large surface area of nanoparticles also makes them ideal
<br>
catalysts, whose surface atoms orchestrate chemical reactions. Whereas
<br>
bulk gold, for example, is unreactive at room temperature, 3- to
<br>
5-nanometer gold particles can promote a number of common reactions
<br>
and have already been developed commercially by a Japanese company as
<br>
bathroom &quot;odor eaters.&quot;
<br>
<p>Enhanced properties on the nanoscale continue to be discovered. A
<br>
number of companies are experimenting with spiking common plastics
<br>
with nanosized particles in order to bolster properties such as
<br>
strength and impact resistance. Nanosized probes are being developed
<br>
to detect biological weapons such as anthrax. And carbon
<br>
nanotubes--tiny, straw-shaped molecules a mere nanometer or so
<br>
across--have been shown to conduct either like metals or
<br>
semiconductors depending on their precise geometry, and they have
<br>
already been incorporated into a range of electrical components such
<br>
as transistors and diodes.
<br>
<p>Reality gap
<br>
<p>For most nanobased applications, the key to progress is
<br>
straightforward: Find ways to make very fine particles or layers of
<br>
material of a precise size, which, when incorporated directly into a
<br>
final plastic or solar cell, all share the same electronic, optical,
<br>
and mechanical properties. These simple products are already finding
<br>
their way into the marketplace, and their relative ease of production
<br>
might always ensure them the biggest share of the business.
<br>
<p>Most of the buzz about nanotechnology, however, involves more
<br>
sophisticated applications of nanomaterials, such as electronic
<br>
devices and tiny chemical sensors. The holdup, so far, is that in most
<br>
cases there's no obvious way to transform single demonstration devices
<br>
into a working technology.  &quot;Nanotechnology is an area that is
<br>
profoundly reductionist,&quot; says Harvard University chemist George
<br>
Whitesides. &quot;We can pick matter apart at its basic level of the atom
<br>
and reassemble it.&quot; But researchers, he warns, mustn't take that
<br>
ability too seriously. &quot;We want to be sure we don't fall completely
<br>
over that cliff.&quot;
<br>
<p>Whitesides's point is that although it is possible to manipulate
<br>
individual atoms, it's much harder to do it on a grand scale. In 1998,
<br>
for example, researchers led by Cees Dekker at the Delft University of
<br>
Technology in the Netherlands reported making the first transistor
<br>
using a carbon nanotube as a key component of the device. Work since
<br>
has shown that the electronic performance of such transistors can
<br>
approach or even surpass that of conventional silicon
<br>
transistors. &quot;But there is a problem here,&quot; says Tom Theis, who heads
<br>
physical sciences research at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research
<br>
Laboratory in Yorktown Heights, New York. When it comes to making
<br>
computer chips containing millions of such devices, &quot;it's completely
<br>
unmanufacturable.&quot;
<br>
<p>The problem of manufacturability remains nanotechnology's Achilles'
<br>
heel, particularly for the much-hyped possibility of creating
<br>
nanosized machines. &quot;The technology is still almost wholly on the
<br>
drawing board,&quot; John Seely Brown writes in a research paper submitted
<br>
to the September NSF meeting.  Brown, who heads the famed Xerox Palo
<br>
Alto Research Center in California, points out that two of the main
<br>
proponents of nanomachines, Ralph Merkle and K. Eric Drexler, built
<br>
powerful nano-CAD tools and then ran simulations of the resulting
<br>
designs. &quot;The simulations showed definitively that nano devices are
<br>
theoretically feasible,&quot; Brown writes. &quot;But theoretically feasible and
<br>
practically feasible are two different things. And as yet, no-one has
<br>
laid out in any detail a route from lab-based simulation or the
<br>
extremely elementary nanodevices that have been chemically constructed
<br>
to practical development.&quot;
<br>
<p>But others argue that visionary research serves a purpose, too. Even
<br>
if nanogears and pistons cannot be built yet, says Deepak Srivastava,
<br>
who heads the computer nanotechnology design group at NASA's Ames
<br>
Research Center in Moffett Field, California, the computer designs
<br>
still help focus experimentalists on what's worth looking for: &quot;If the
<br>
ideas are based on real physics and chemistry, one has to know the
<br>
real possibilities.&quot;
<br>
<p>And of course, experimental science is constantly expanding the scope
<br>
of what is feasible. Whitesides and Stephen Chou of Princeton
<br>
University have recently pioneered a new rubber stamping method for
<br>
patterning surfaces with features as small as 10 nanometers. That is
<br>
well below the current size limit of about 200 nanometers faced by
<br>
photolithography, the primary patterning tool used by the computer
<br>
chip industry. Still, the stamping technique has its own drawbacks: It
<br>
has trouble patterning multiple materials in three dimensions, as is
<br>
needed for making computer chips, and ensuring proper alignment of all
<br>
the various layers of material.
<br>
<p>Another patterning alternative making headway is a burgeoning subfield
<br>
of chemistry known as self-assembly, in which researchers design
<br>
materials to assemble themselves into desired finished structures. For
<br>
example, last year IBM researchers led by chemist Christopher Murray
<br>
came up with a way to make metallic particles as small as 3 nanometers
<br>
and then assemble them into a three-dimensional array.  Such
<br>
structures could lead to material for future computer disks in which
<br>
each nanoparticle stores a bit of data. Still, for now such successes
<br>
tend to be the exception rather than the rule.
<br>
<p>Future nanoapplications face other grand challenges as well. Even if
<br>
particular nanocomponents can be mass-produced, researchers will still
<br>
need to figure out how to position them on surfaces or other
<br>
structures so they can be used as components in electronic devices,
<br>
sensors, and the like. For tiny electronic components, researchers
<br>
will then face the major stumbling block of wiring them up to the
<br>
macro world.
<br>
<p>They will also confront the more mundane challenge of connecting with
<br>
one another. By all accounts, nanotechnology will require an
<br>
extraordinary range of expertise. Researchers have long embraced the
<br>
concept of interdisciplinary research. And organizations such as the
<br>
NSF make it a point to finance interdisciplinary centers. Still,
<br>
academia remains largely hidebound in disciplines, making it difficult
<br>
to pursue research that falls between traditional fields. &quot;There still
<br>
exist many elements in the culture of our research universities that
<br>
discourage multidisciplinary research,&quot; says James Merz, the vice
<br>
president for graduate studies and research at the University of Notre
<br>
Dame in Indiana.
<br>
<p>Among the chief culprits Merz points to are the administrative
<br>
autonomy given to separate departments and the fact that faculty
<br>
members must obtain tenure from specific departments. Furthermore,
<br>
Theis points out, essentially no curricula have been developed to
<br>
train future researchers in the field, let alone degree programs to
<br>
turn out new nanotech Ph.D.s. Although those impediments aren't
<br>
necessarily fatal, they can easily hamper the field's development,
<br>
Merz says.
<br>
<p>Beset by such challenges, nanoreality is bound to fall short of
<br>
nanohype. The danger is that disenchantment with the gap could dampen
<br>
financial support for the field, says Mihail Roco of NSF, who heads
<br>
the U.S.  National Nanotechnology Initiative. That's a scenario well
<br>
known to researchers in high-temperature superconductivity, an
<br>
enterprise that has struggled to live up to the fanfare that greeted
<br>
it in the mid-1980s.  Still, unlike superconductivity--a narrow field
<br>
whose impact is limited to a comparatively small sphere of
<br>
applications--nanotechnology is likely to benefit from its breadth,
<br>
says Srivastava. &quot;Since the net is much wider,&quot; he says, &quot;the chance
<br>
is bigger that you will catch some fish.&quot;
