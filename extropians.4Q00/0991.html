<p>
Okay, folks.  What has happened to the Extropian Principles?  I am saddened.
<br>
<p>I opened up my ZIA multimedia from 1994 to read an older verion of the Extropian Principles,
<br>
because I thought that the new ones looked much much different than I had remembered.  All of
<br>
these years I was chanting mostly number 1, 3, and 5 of the 2.5 version, that I had engraved in
<br>
memory. Now I feel like a fool that they hardly exist anymore.
<br>
<p>I suppose I shouldn't complain too much, since I haven't been around for the &quot;PERPETUAL PROGRESS&quot; 
<br>
you have made here.  But these principles sound much more practical and politically correct and
<br>
less dynamic than they used to.  Perhaps I should try to be more of a &quot;PRACTICAL OPTIMIST&quot; and not
<br>
so much the &quot;DYNAMIC OPTIMIST&quot; I have chosen to be all these years.
<br>
<p>But I WON'T!  By golly, I am a &quot;DYNAMIC optimist&quot;!! 
<br>
<p>PRACTICAL optimism is not going to get us into space, and that is the focus of my life.
<br>
<p>I am sure these principles have been subtly morphing over the years, and I do not wish to haggle
<br>
over them, personally.  I just urge you all to re-read this older version which I have made a part
<br>
of my life for several years now.  I find them easy to remember and to chant, and straight and to
<br>
the point, without sounding too politically correct or too touchy-feely.  They are short and to
<br>
the point, and have enough GRIT.
<br>
<p><p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Extropian Principles 2.5
<br>
<p>1. BOUNDLESS EXPANSION - seeking more intelligence, wisdom, and effectiveness, an unlimited
<br>
lifespan, and the removal of political, cultural, biological, and psychological limits to
<br>
self-actualization and self-realization.  Perpetually overcoming constraints on our progress and
<br>
possibilities.  Expanding into the universe and advancing without end.
<br>
<p>2. Self-Transformation - Affirming continual moral, intellectual, and physical self-improvement,
<br>
through reason and critical thinking, personal responsibility and experimentation.  Seeking
<br>
biological and neurological augmentation.
<br>
<p>3. DYNAMIC Optimism - Fueling dynamic action with positive expectations.  Adopting an rationaL,
<br>
action-based optimism, SHUNNING both blind faith and stagnant pessimism.
<br>
<p>4. Intelligent Technology - Applying sciency and technology creatively to transcend &quot;natural&quot;
<br>
limits imposed by our biological heritage, culture, and environment.
<br>
<p>5. SPONTANEOUS ORDER (THIS BECAME THREE PRINCIPLES INSTEAD OF ONE ! ) - Supporting decentralized
<br>
voluntaristic social coordination processes.  Fostering tolerance, diversity, long-term thinking,
<br>
personal responsibility, and individual liberty.
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Extropian Principles 3.0
<br>
<p>1. PERPETUAL PROGRESS - Seeking more intelligence, wisdom, and effectiveness, an indefinite
<br>
lifespan, and the removal of political, cultural, biological, and psychological limits to
<br>
self-actualization and self-realization. Perpetually overcoming constraints on our progress and
<br>
possibilities. Expanding into the universe and advancing without end. (FIRST OF ALL, THE TERM
<br>
&quot;BOUNDLESS EXPANSION&quot; IS GONE, WHICH WAS ONE OF MY THREE FAVORITE PRINCIPLES THAT I HAVE BEEN
<br>
CHANTING OVER THE YEARS...HOW DEPRESSING. THE OTHER TWO WERE &quot;DYNAMIC OPTIMISM&quot; WHICH GOT CHANGED
<br>
TO &quot;PRACTICAL&quot; OPTIMISM, AND SPONTANEOUS ORDER, WHICH GOT EXPANDED INTO THREE, SOMEWHAT REDUNDANT
<br>
AND BORING PRINCIPLES, THAT RELATE MORE OF AN EVERY COMMON SENSE THAN A DYNAMIC NEW MOVEMENT. WHAT
<br>
A LETDOWN.)
<br>
<p>2. Self-Transformation - Affirming continual moral, intellectual, and physical self-improvement,
<br>
through critical and creative thinking, personal responsibility, and experimentation. Seeking
<br>
biological and neurological augmentation ALONG WITH EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL REFINEMENT. (ICK!
<br>
THIS LAST PART MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THIS IS SOME SORT OF BRAINWASHING CULT, OR  LIKE THE EMOTIONAL
<br>
AND PSYCHOLOGICAL REFINEMENT ARE ALSO PART OF SOME SURGICAL PROCEDURE. SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE ALONG
<br>
THE LINE MUST HAVE TRIED TO MAKE THIS SOUND MORE TOUCHY FEELY.  OH BROTHER.)
<br>
<p>3. PRACTICAL Optimism - Fueling action with positive expectations. Adopting a rational,
<br>
action-based optimism, IN PLACE OF both blind faith and stagnant pessimism. (WHAT HAS COME OVER
<br>
THE EXTROPIAN COMMUNITY, TO REPLACE THE WORD &quot;DYNAMIC&quot; WITH THE WORD &quot;PRACTICAL&quot;?  AND WHY WAS
<br>
&quot;SHUNNING&quot; REPLACED WITH &quot;IN PLACE OF&quot;?).  
<br>
<p>4. Intelligent Technology - Applying science and technology creatively to transcend &quot;natural&quot;
<br>
limits imposed by our biological heritage, culture, and environment. SEEING TECHNOLOGY NOT AS AN
<br>
END IN ITSELF BUT AS AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TOWARDS THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIFE. 
<br>
<p>5. Open Society - Supporting social orders that foster freedom of speech, freedom of action, and
<br>
experimentation. Opposing authoritarian social control and favoring the rule of law and
<br>
decentralization of power. Preferring bargaining over battling, and exchange over compulsion.
<br>
Openness to improvement rather than a static utopia.
<br>
<p>6. Self-Direction - Seeking independent thinking, individual freedom, personal responsibility,
<br>
self-direction, self-esteem, and respect for others. (WHY CAN THIS JUST BE PART OF
<br>
SELF-TRANSFORMATION?)
<br>
<p>7. Rational Thinking - FAVORING REASON OVER BLIND FAITH AND QUESTIONING OVER DOGMA (REDUNDANT! SEE
<br>
DYNAMIC/PRACTICAL OPTIMISM). Remaining open to challenges to our beliefs and practices in pursuit
<br>
of perpetual improvement. Welcoming criticism of our existing beliefs while being open to new
<br>
ideas.
