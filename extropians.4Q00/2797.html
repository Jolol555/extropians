<p>Your best bet for building muscle is to take in about one gram of protein for 
<br>
every pound you weigh (assuming you aren't obese). The quality of protein 
<br>
makes a difference.  Proteins that contain a higher percentage of essential 
<br>
amino acids are what to look for. Whey protein is popular. Some people worry 
<br>
that high levels of protein can cause kidney damage but the trick is to take 
<br>
in no more then about forty grams at one time and to space it out during the 
<br>
day.  A problem you might run into, however, is that you will never build 
<br>
muscle on that low of a caloric intake.  If you want to lose fat your best 
<br>
bet is to build muscle. This will burn the fat for you.  I know a lot of 
<br>
extropians feel that restricting their diets could increase their lifespans 
<br>
but I feel that it diminishes the quality of your life too much, and by the 
<br>
time I have to worry about my life span regenerative medicine will be readily 
<br>
available.  I'm getting ready to start a new routine this week. It calls for 
<br>
4,000 calories a day but I should be able to pile on about twelve pounds of 
<br>
muscle in six months.  If you're still concerned about body fat though, do 
<br>
sprints or some other form of high intensity exercise.  Forget jogging.  
<br>
Would you rather have the body of a sprinter or a marathon runner? And when 
<br>
you do weight train remember to work all three types of muscle fibers for 
<br>
maximal growth.
