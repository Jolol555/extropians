<p>When I said the argument was Wittgensteinian, I didn't mean that it
<br>
was actually Wittgenstein's.  (Though I think he would have approved.)
<br>
I believe I got it from Hilary Putnam, who got it while thinking about
<br>
Wittgenstein and relativism.
<br>
<p>Kant is good, but if you're not already familiar with the turf, it's
<br>
usually good to have someone help you to read him.  The trouble is
<br>
that the structure of his prose is, ah, subtle, while it's clear that
<br>
his German translators have read so much of him that they've forgotten
<br>
the difference between clear prose and bad.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Okay, I'm not a relativist.
</em><br>
<p>Let this be a lesson to the rest of you: you get more progress from
<br>
charitable head-on engagement than from pithy one liners.  ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You want my belief?  Here are two quotes that sum up my way of thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty well (the first from Zarathustra, the second from Hesse's &quot;Demian&quot;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;A day shall come when you shall see your high things no more, and your low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things all too near, and you will fear your exaltation as if it were a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phantom.  In that day you will cry: All is false!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;An enlightened man had but one duty- to seek the way to himself, to reach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inner certainty, to grope his way forward, no matter where it led.  I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often speculated with images of the future, dreamed of roles that might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assigned, perhaps as poet, or prophet, or painter, or something similar.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All that was futile.  I did not exist to write poems, to preach or to paint,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neither I nor anyone else.  All of that was incidental.  Each man had only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one genuine vocation- to find the way to himself.  He might end up as poet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or madman, as prophet or criminal- that was not his affair, ultimately it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was of no concern.  His task was to discover his own destiny- not an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arbitrary one- and live it out wholly and resolutely within himself.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My belief is very existential- frankly, do what you love, and do what thou
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wilt.  In the end, we're all headed to the same place- so we should all try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to discover which side we are on, which faction we are in.  There is truth-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it cannot be known for certain.  I think that there is a pretty good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance that in the end, truth is defined by the state of the individual's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence, and all we can do is play this beautiful game.
</em><br>
<p>Now, in THIS, you'll definitely find friends here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, in that case, what makes your beliefs true?
</em><br>
<p>This depends on whether you mean &quot;you&quot; as in &quot;not me&quot; or &quot;you&quot; as in
<br>
&quot;one of us&quot; (eg &quot;how do you [someone like me] bake a cake?&quot;).
<br>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing that &quot;makes&quot; my beliefs true.
<br>
There's nothing more to say about truth than Tarski's Convention T:
<br>
&quot;Snow is white&quot; is true iff snow is white.  That's all she wrote about
<br>
truth.
<br>
<p>As for what makes YOUR beliefs true, well, I have to set up
<br>
T-sentences for you as well.  If you're speaking German, then one
<br>
T-sentence might be: &quot;Schnee ist weiss&quot; is true iff snow is white.  Of
<br>
course, you might not be speaking German, but might be speaking
<br>
differently from the way I speak.  To figure out which is which, I
<br>
have to interpret what you say using the interpretive principles of
<br>
charity (I have to assume that you are largely right about what you
<br>
say) and humanity (I have to assume that you tend to acquire beliefs
<br>
the same way I do).  But once I figure out those in a way which makes
<br>
sense to me, there's nothing more to say besides that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First off, I know nothing about you, and little about your beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You could believe that I am a purple elephant with a telepathic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internet connection who has falsified all the data that I have given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about myself, but it would not make it true.  Yet, you could stand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for and defend this belief, and even try to force me to accept it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true.
</em><br>
<p>Yup.  While charity dictates that, given extreme evidence, you doubt
<br>
that I hold purple elephant beliefs, (&quot;no no no! by elephant, he must
<br>
mean 'great man!'&quot;), charity and humanity can and do break
<br>
down... some people and beliefs are just wrong.  You know what to do
<br>
under those circumstances.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, in other words, I'm going to reject your false beliefs- and uphold my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true beliefs.  That's what it comes down to, doesn't it? ;)
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.
