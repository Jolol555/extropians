<p>If the patterns were the same everywhere, maybe AS easy I'll grant.
<br>
<p>Here's another point, it doesn't matter how many people vote, so
<br>
long as you get the most votes in a state. Theoretically one person
<br>
voting in Calif (only one) could give a candidate 56 electoral
<br>
votes. A handfull in key states could successfully oppose millions
<br>
to 1 odds.
<br>
<p>Actually the systems flaws speak for themselves, the guy who got
<br>
less votes may actually win.
