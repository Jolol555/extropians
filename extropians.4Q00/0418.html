<p>Yes, Robin, I like that image.  
<br>
<p>Another aspect of the bizarre here is the belief that &quot;Sooner or later
<br>
the phyxical system [will pass] out of the regime where the equation
<br>
fit&quot;.  Yes, it's true that it's common for &quot;reality [to] deviate from
<br>
the model&quot;, but the better job you've done of showing that some
<br>
equation fits the real world, the less reason you have for believing
<br>
you've found a phenomenon that should be expected to expire.  A lot of
<br>
people use &quot;there's a first time for everything&quot; as if it means
<br>
everything will eventually happen, rather than that everything that
<br>
actually does happen has a first occurence.
<br>
<p>The moment when you've found a new consistency to the universe is not
<br>
the time to start predicting that things will be different in the
<br>
future.  Exceptions to old consistencies might reasonably drive people
<br>
to look for explanations: either the old rule wasn't general enough or
<br>
things have changed.  But a newly noticed consistency is something to
<br>
take advantage of, not something you should expect to be violated now
<br>
that you've noticed it.
