Yay, Samantha!
<br>
<p>There are word lessons and *world* lessons. I am not a deathist, but
<br>
pace Eliezer, who wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There are other ways.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creates more wisdom through education and cultural self-awareness [than suffering]
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps, but not all wisdom. And not all of what a person goes through
<br>
in the course of a long life in a body growing older is &quot;suffering&quot;. But
<br>
even the suffering, some of it, produces character. I don't think
<br>
&quot;education&quot; would have taught me what it is like to do things I deeply
<br>
regret, and come to terms with it. I think that's part of what the
<br>
critic is driving at, too. 
<br>
<p>Maturation to Pak &quot;Protector&quot; stage, anyone? Even if it hurts, some?

<em>&gt; &gt; My god, that review... I keep hearing the same damn opinion echoed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; right down to the same cliche metaphors, from people who couldn't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possibly met! Where is this crap coming from?! It just doesn't make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sense. Having exhausted all the rational explanations, I'm left with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the following theories:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It comes from the same place our own opinions come from.  There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always relatively conserving of the status quo forces arrayed against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively expansionist forces of change.  Indeed there is some need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it be that way.  Why does it dismay you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1. Aliens have infiltrated our culture and are spreading defeatist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; memes, presumably to non-violently pre-empt competition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Competition is one of many memes.  One that is not the cure for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evils now and forever necessarily.  In the Open Source world I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another word being floated, &quot;coopetition&quot;.  Cooperate where cooperation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the best choice or where there are common interest served and compete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in other areas.  Defeatist stuff has been part of human cultures from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the beginning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2. Once a culture reaches a certain critical size a subtle, low-key
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mass insanity (mass neurosis?) takes hold. CF fall of the Roman Empire.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, they in part got screwed by having much of their plumbing and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drinking untensils of the rich be lined with lead.  Lead poisoning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychosis is not a pretty thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As the pace of change accelerates more and more people will feel serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strain.  Many of them will attempt to stand aside from the changes or to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demand they slow down or go away.  Many will choose between old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious values they once learned and having to cope with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasingly complex real world.  If you want to reach them perhaps you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to show them that this changing world is actually massively in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their interest and that of their children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That article was not completely off.  From a point of view of attempting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to learn wisdom in the face of adversity (which many have learned to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prize throughout human history) it seems quite perverse to simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminate huge swaths of the adversity thus making the wisdom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepting it foolish.  It is not difficult to understand how some people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would feel this way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3. Humans have an inherent tendency toward self-defeatism and hatred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of success. Except us mutants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No.  Not except us mutants.  We are all too human.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 4. Some religionists went underground and resurfaced as &quot;modern&quot; luddites.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Religionists have not uniformly been in a luddite or anti-progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; camp.  You can fine perfectly healthy religious fervor in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians.  Except that many of us think we see how a true New Heaven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and New Earth (if you will) can come to be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Whatever the case, there's too many of them to enlighten. We'll soon be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; overrun. The only remaining course of action is clear... let's re-read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Atlas Shrugged and start packing our bags.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you then assume people cannot be reached and cannot change?  Where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly will you pack your bags off too?  You might want to develop an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impervious force field before claiming a sufficiently large hunk of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earth real estate for all of us.
