<p>That paper is just referring to a large economic literature that does
<br>
try to explain procrastination via non-exponential discounting.
<br>
A common model is &quot;hyperbolic&quot; discounting.  If you could persuasively
<br>
show such models to be inconsistent with experiments, you could publish
<br>
that and win fame among economists.  So far such models do a reasonable
<br>
job of accounting for a wide range of otherwise puzzling phenomena.

(I really do think you want to become an economist Hal :-).
