</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Darthmouth students who painted swastikas on a few street signs in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Norwich as a ploy to promote a 'diversity celebration' they had planned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I know its rather stereotypical of me to say this, but these individuals
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Their cause?  I was under the impression that objective law applied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equally to all was in everyone's interest.  If we act like it is &quot;our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause&quot; then we are guilty according to your lights of fragmenting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community and being self-involved.  If we point out that it is simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equal rights everyone says we are claiming &quot;special rights&quot;.  Yet out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own mouth you see the call for equality under the law being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something for us perhaps against others.
</em><br>
<p>Did I say I was opposed to civil unions? No, I didn't. I am, in fact,
<br>
for them, but because I'm not gay, it isn't really 'my cause', unless I
<br>
want to form a civil union with my sister or mother or brother, etc
<br>
(which is the unmentioned other half of the civil unions law). Most of
<br>
the population will NEVER be convinced that the definition of marriage
<br>
is anything other than a union between a man and woman for purposes of
<br>
producing children in a legally protected arena. Its not about a
<br>
contract of mutual enslavement, or strictly about financial
<br>
incorporation as a partnership, or to justify a purely emotional
<br>
relationship between two people. That is not to say that there are not
<br>
instruments for people to gain legal sanction for any of those
<br>
activities either, but they are not about what marriage is about. Many
<br>
lawyers will say a business partnership is 'like a marriage'. But they
<br>
will not say that it is in fact a marriage. The two are very distinctly
<br>
different things.
