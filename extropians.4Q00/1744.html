I agree that the weakest point of their argument is that it is
<br>
difficult to tell how much people value their past selves.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; It is fundamentally not an issue of learning.  It is a conflict of preferences.

</em><br>
<p>Imagine we were in a club with a rotating chairmanship, and that the chairman
<br>
decided where we would meet each month.   Then each month we might meet
<br>
at that month's chairman's favorite restaraunt.  If we all got together on voted
<br>
on where to meet, however, we might compromise on some place and then get
<br>
the benefits of having a regular meeting place.  And on average we might
<br>
each prefer the regular meeting place compromise to each having our favorite
<br>
choice every few years, and then having to go to a different place each month
<br>
at other times.
<br>
<p>Similarly, regretting our past actions can be a matter of failing to coordinate
<br>
among our different selves at different times.
