<p>
The discussion on mysticism, spirituality, numerology, astrology, and so on 
<br>
has led to some differing views regarding what's appropriate discussion on 
<br>
this List. First, let me quote the start of the Welcome Message:
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
Welcome to the Extropians List! This List has hosted innovative discussions 
<br>
on the Internet continuously since 1991. We welcome innovative discussions 
<br>
pertaining to scientific, technological, philosophical, artistic, economic, 
<br>
and social perspectives on the future.
<br>
<p>If you are not familiar with extropian thinking, I suggest you read the 
<br>
posts for a while before you begin to post. You will gain an idea of how 
<br>
the list works, and see how the range of topics varies from week to week 
<br>
and month to month. If you read only one document to get an idea of the 
<br>
attitudes and values shared by extropians despite all their diversity, 
<br>
please read The Extropian Principles 3.0. You can find this at:
<br>

<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<p>While I agree with Eliezer that discussions of clear pseudoscience such as 
<br>
astrology and numerology are out of place here, I think his view of what's 
<br>
appropriate is overly narrow. Even some discussions of mysticism may be 
<br>
useful given that the term covers a lot of ground from utterly irrational 
<br>
wishful thinking to arguably useful practices such as meditation, yogic 
<br>
exercises, and non-rational (but *not* irrational) means of understanding. 
<br>
This list also is not limited to science. To re-quote, it welcomes 
<br>
&quot;innovative discussions pertaining to scientific, technological, 
<br>
philosophical, artistic, economic, and social perspectives on the future.&quot;
<br>
<p>Personally, while I enjoy the continued theoretical discussions, I would 
<br>
like to see more discussion of practical possibilities that we are actually 
<br>
working on now. That's one reason I jumped in with some exercise 
<br>
suggestions. The forthcoming Retreat will definitely have a practical 
<br>
orientation. You'll see what I mean when I post some information about the 
<br>
Retreat in the next few days.
<br>
<p>Onward!
<br>
