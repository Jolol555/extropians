</em><br>
<p>I'm enjoying your thesis immensely, Nick. I'm currently in Chapter 2, regarding
<br>
Hackings mistake with the Inverse Gambler's Fallacy as applied to Wheeler type
<br>
universes. I don't notice that you've accounted for the fact that Wheeler
<br>
universes, in depending on being able to collapse again to generate the next
<br>
iteration, exclude the set of possible open ended universes (which our own seems
<br>
to be), and thus is a Self Selected set. In your variable example of the
<br>
expansion rate, a Wheeler Universe dictates a maximum limit to the expansion
<br>
rate as a precondition of its being a Wheeler Universe.
<br>
<p>You then go on to White and Dowe's analysis to decribe the other error of the
<br>
IGF, the assumption that the fact that this universe is fine tuned implies that
<br>
many other universes exist in the ensemble multiverse, when the odds are the
<br>
same for every individual toss of the die, irrespective of the number or results
<br>
of previous tosses. The thing is that if the odds of any given toss being double
<br>
sixes is 1 in 36, then if there have been 36 tosses, the odds that at least one
<br>
such toss is double sixes approaches unity. 
<br>
<p>Likewise, given a plenum of possible values of tunable criteria, and the degree
<br>
of precision required to acheive a 'tuned' universe in any given toss, the more
<br>
tosses there are increases the odds that there is at least one such tuned
<br>
universe among the ensemble. However White objects to the supposition that that
<br>
one such tuned universe is the one we happen to be in as a result of that
<br>
tossing. Your demolition of this argument in respect to life bearing universes
<br>
due to the IF..THEN..ELSE nature of quantum mechanics is rather good, but may or
<br>
may not apply to the present case of intelligent species on other worlds within
<br>
this universe. I initially think its safe to assume that most all, if not all,
<br>
selection criteria for intelligent life developing on any given planet occur
<br>
long after an intelligent life bearing planety in one star system has had any
<br>
significant effect on another in another star system (however this is where we
<br>
begin to collide with the Fermi Paradox, depending on the propability of
<br>
intelligent technological space faring life in any given light year range versus
<br>
their racial/cultural life expectancy (i.e. racial death or other ending like a
<br>
technological singularity)).
<br>
<p>If space travelers do influence the selection criteria for other worlds or not
<br>
is a point of potential information transfer, and thus, selection. Because the
<br>
odds are low that any given spacefaring race would be developmentally parallel
<br>
to any other race at any range of proximity, and thus that any given point of
<br>
selection in our own development could have been, or could have been interrupted
<br>
by a spacefaring race visiting our planet (of which we have no evidence to
<br>
support), from the prokaryotic shift onward, we can infer that not only is there
<br>
a limit on the rate at which a space faring race can spread, but a time limit on
<br>
how long any given space faring race retains either or both any interest or
<br>
reason to be involved with terrestrial type worlds, as well as any means of
<br>
embodiment by which a more primitive race would recognise groups and/or
<br>
individual members of such races (and their impact upon the surrounding
<br>
universe) as a sign of intelligence (as well as other possible limitations).
<br>
These possible obervational selection effects thus not only determine why life
<br>
exists in this universe, but why one life form has not overrun the universe
<br>
previously, that the selection criteria that remove them from the stage are
<br>
mandated in order for us to exist to observe this universe. 
<br>
<p>These alternative explanations to the Fermi Paradox have been hashed out here
<br>
time and again in various forms, but I do enjoy your much more formal treatment
<br>
of the subject. Your demolition of White does seem to be supported by M Theory,
<br>
which explains six possible classes of universes, one of which our own universe
<br>
belongs to.
<br>
<p>Now, in a tuned universe that is hospitible to the development of life, to use
<br>
your delineation between surprising outcomes and improbable but unsurprising
<br>
outcomes, we need to decide which is which: Is the existence and evidence of
<br>
only one intelligent species in x cubic light years of space surprising, or
<br>
improbable but unsurprising? If it is the first, then Fermi's Paradox is a
<br>
problem. If it is the second, then Fermi's Paradox is not.
<br>
<p>TANSTAAFL!
