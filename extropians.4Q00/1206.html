<p>In 1973, four Swedes held in a bank vault for six days during a robbery became
<br>
attached to their captors, a phenomenon dubbed the Stockholm Syndrome. 
<br>
According to psychologists, the abused bond to their abusers as a means to
<br>
endure violence. The most notorious instance came when heiress Patty Hearst was
<br>
kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army, and after some months,
<br>
re-christened herself &quot;Tanya&quot; and joined their ranks. &quot;Get down or I'll blow
<br>
your motherfucking heads off,&quot; she shouted while robbing a San Francisco bank
<br>
with fellow S.L.A. members in April, 1974. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
&lt;&lt; Stockholm Syndrome is common in survivors of humanly perpetrated trauma,
<br>
particularly battering (emotional, mental or physical), sexual assault,
<br>
kidnapping, ritual abuse, and govt. mind-control experimentation and slavery.
<br>
Stockholm Syndrome develops when a victim is in a situation where he or she is
<br>
in the presence of -- and cannot escape -- a person who is at least temporarily
<br>
stronger or more powerful, and seems or is threatening. The victim has no choice
<br>
but to focus on the face, voice and mannerisms of the captor or abuser. The
<br>
victim begins to find ways, at least on a subconscious level, of pleasing and
<br>
appeasing the captor or abuser. The victim does this as a natural, inbred means
<br>
of surviving the trauma, with the hope of not being hurt. The victim, by
<br>
focusing on the captor or abuser, begins to find and focus on &quot;good&quot; things
<br>
about the perpetrator. This is also called &quot;identification with the aggressor.&quot;
<br>
In extreme cases, the victim may develop alter-states that are based on the
<br>
captor's or abuser's face, voice and mannerisms. While focusing on the captor or
<br>
abuser, the victim avoids his or her own pain and terror, by trancing and
<br>
thereby dissociating from
<br>
these unpleasant sensations and emotions. Dealing with Stockholm Syndrome is a
<br>
problem when a victim becomes a recovering survivor. He or she may still be
<br>
sympathetic towards, or may still identify with, the perpetrator. If the
<br>
survivor has M.P.D. (Multiple Personality Disorder) or D.I.D. (Dissociative
<br>
Identity Disorder), he or she may also discover that he or she has perpetrator
<br>
alter-states based on the former captor's or abuser's perceived personality. &gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>Its rather evident that this is pretty standard trauma psychology. Knowing this,
<br>
its also rather evident that the media and politicians, who DO know about it, do
<br>
not call this spade by its name and dismiss the anti-liberty policies that are
<br>
generated with the support of so many people suffering from Stockholm Syndrome
<br>
in society because they wish to use this phenomenon to extend their tyranny.
<br>
Government by insanity is a definite threat to the republic.
