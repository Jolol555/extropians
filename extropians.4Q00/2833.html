<p><em>&gt; Body modifications of infants unable to make decisions happen quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often.  One of the most obvious examples is circumcision.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Admittedly, being hidden by a loincloth, it is not the same as being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; branded on the face.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. A much more nontrivial effect is in utreo surgery, where surgery
<br>
is performed before birth. Or for that matter if the mother eats
<br>
special food in order to affect the child.
<br>
<p>This is of course old territory in bioethics, but I would like to see
<br>
if a consistent transhumanist or extropian theory could be
<br>
developed. I think that, based on the principles, we have the seeds
<br>
for building some good ethics and politics for grownups but where we
<br>
really need to develop some new stuff is in these murky areas where
<br>
individuality, selfhood and potentiality interact in tricky ways. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; About lawsuits, people generally have the right to raise their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children how they would, there are certain rules about abuse and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neglect. 
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. So what standards should we transhumanists suggest? I think
<br>
it is fairly clear that we would consider it abuse if changes or
<br>
upbringing limited or negated the possibility of the child developing
<br>
into a full human being, able to fulfill its potential etc. But what
<br>
about minor nastiness, like religious icons on the forehead, or
<br>
radical changes that the parents could claim did not even produce a
<br>
human in need of protection (&quot;It is my body, dammit, and I use it to
<br>
manufacture sentient biocomputer parts if I want to!&quot;). Sure, these
<br>
later possibilities are not very likely to be common, but they show
<br>
the tricky problems a transhumanist bioethics must be able to deal
<br>
with.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Anyways, at some point we can tell the computer what enzymes we want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and thus print RNA to make them, in the comfort of our own homes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus any demyelinization of the neuron could be stopped, as well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any tumors proactively prevented, and cells' multiplication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delimited.
</em><br>
<p>In theory, yes. But the devil lurks in the details - protein folding
<br>
is a hard problem, and even if you could design an enzyme for doing
<br>
function A it is hard to see if it is also going to have unforeseen
<br>
effect B. Not to mention that this relies on fairly mature technology,
<br>
essentially biological nanotechnology.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; As soon as the zygote is fertilized, and then it multiplies, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the genome for that future person, if it is born.  If the gene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely predicts massive congenital birth defects, it is perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better to use a different fertilized zygote that has a better chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a happy development and maturity.  As soon as the zygote is then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulated, then it too easily leads to the spiral of eugenics.
</em><br>
<p>Which in itself is not bad (unless one believes that it is important
<br>
to maintain an unchanged genome). When it becomes bad is when it is
<br>
used coercively or to implement somebody else's views of what
<br>
constitutes a human bein instead of the parents. Of course, some
<br>
critics would say that even having parents chose genes is coercion
<br>
against the child (I don't buy that argument; the child does not exist
<br>
at that point, it is just a potentiality for a person - rights appear
<br>
as it grows up. But that should not be a reason for prenatal
<br>
mistreatment).
