<p><em>    &gt; Is it absolutely necessary to use a fission reaction to trigger a fusion reaction,
</em><br>
<p>No, but it's not knows if you can trigger one strong enough worthy of the name
<br>
&quot;bomb&quot; without fission.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;or are other means just not feasible for an easily deployable warhead?
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; I was reading about how shrimp have been discovered to produce 5000 degree
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; sonoluminescent bubbles with their claws via cavitation, and I am wondering how
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; much research has been done in using shaped charges or other acoustical focusing
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; methods to generate fusion reactions.
</em><br>
<p>They've gotten much higher temperatures than that from sonoluminescent bubbles, at least
<br>
50,000 degrees and possibly as high as one million, still too low for fusion but pretty amazing,
<br>
it's not clear how it works. It's very hard to measure the temperature because at those
<br>
temperatures the main product is X rays and they're strongly absorbed by water.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; If as you say, the mass defect is only 2  or 3 times greater, doesn't that mean you should
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;be able to acheive such a  reaction with enough high explosives?
</em><br>
<p>I mean that a fusion bomb would be 2 or 3 times as powerful as a fission bomb with an
<br>
equal mass of fuel. I think there is little hope of achieving fusion with chemical explosives.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;How much more energy does the clean D-H3  reaction require over
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;non-clean D-T reaction?
</em><br>
<p>About 10 times.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; OK. How easily does this radioactivity work its way through materials?
</em><br>
<p>The main target for the neutron bomb (a H bomb with the smallest possible fission trigger)
<br>
was tanks because the metal armor gave little protection against neutrons. The military
<br>
found that the best way to add protection is to place bladders on the tanks filled with a
<br>
solution of water and 20 mule team borax. Boron is very good at absorbing neutrons but
<br>
not the super fast type produced from a H bomb, you've got to slow them down. Iron or lead
<br>
is poor at slowing them down because the nucleus of those elements is so much heavier than
<br>
the neutron that when they collide the neutron just  bounces off the nucleus with its speed hardly
<br>
changed. But the nucleus of hydrogen in water is almost the same mass as a neutron so when
<br>
they collide much of the neutron's energy is transferred to the hydrogen and the neutron slows
<br>
down. When the neutron slows enough the boron will absorb it. You'd need a foot or two of this
<br>
water boron solution to be effective.
