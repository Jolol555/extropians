<p>I'd stay away from really starchy veggies -- unless you are having lots of
<br>
leafy and other ones too.  Carrots and corn, e.g., are too high in sugar,
<br>
compared with spinach and string beans.  If you plan on doing CR, starchy
<br>
plants is probably not the way to go.
<br>
<p>For the record, when I practiced CR a few years ago, I generally ate a lot
<br>
of salads.  For dinner, however, I'd have steamed vegetables -- usually
<br>
cauliflower or spinach or broccoli -- with a small serving of beans
<br>
(lentils, black beans, etc.) and some whole grain -- _real_ wild rice (which
<br>
is black and long) or steel cut oats or rye flakes (all low on the glycemic
<br>
index).  The meals were not terribly interesting, though with some spices
<br>
they were tastey.  I mainly carried on through just sheer force of will.  I
<br>
knew I'd be a little hungry, but always focused on other things.  I did this
<br>
for about a year.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I supplemented heavily accross the vitamin spectrum - my weight went

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just take the standard &quot;one a day&quot;, this most likely is not efficient

</em><br>
<p>I agree.  I take a full spectrum of supplements.  I take them with every
<br>
meal as well as some without meals, such as amino acids.
<br>
<p>People tell me the hardest thing about doing this is remembering, so I
<br>
recommend getting a pill case and stocking it each morning.  After a while,
<br>
it will become a habit.  (If you miss taking them once, don't fret, just
<br>
pick up the next meal or the next day.)  Also, if you can afford the
<br>
supplements, keep an adequate supply around, so you never run out and stop
<br>
taking them.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
