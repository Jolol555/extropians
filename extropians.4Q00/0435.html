</em><br>
<p>I got thinking this over today.  I really dont necessarily have that
<br>
much
<br>
of a beef with Greenpeace.   As for the whale thing, well, Im more of
<br>
a krill man myself, but hey, I like trees.  I used to climb em as a kid,
<br>
and
<br>
now I have several in my yard.
<br>
<p>My goals are pretty much in parallel with theirs in many ways.  I want
<br>
world peace too.  I may have some opposite means.  They carry signs,
<br>
I build lasers.  They advocate peace thru weakness, I advocate peace
<br>
thru STRENGTH.  I say weakness is how wars get started in the first
<br>
place, without fail.  They advocate technological relinquishment, I say
<br>
*all* our problems are *caused* by insufficient technology.  They say
<br>
NO NUKES, well, we *are* no-nukesing.
<br>
<p>We all want peace, so in light of tomorrow's planned protest in
<br>
Sunnyvale,
<br>
I had the following suggestions which, if someone who knows a
<br>
Greenpeacer, please can you pass this along:
<br>
<p>Dear Greenpeace,
<br>
<p>Having heard that you intend to protest the Space Based Laser program
<br>
at Lockheed Martin in Sunnyvale, I wish to help you find the building in
<br>
<p>which the program resides: building 107.  You get off of Mathilda
<br>
Ave going north, just on the north side of  I101, turn left on the
<br>
frontage
<br>
road and head west towards Moffett Air Field, second right is H, then
<br>
first right, then right into the parking lot.  Space Based Laser is
<br>
being
<br>
done in that building.  I will have lunch with you if you wish.  That
<br>
building
<br>
is company property of course, but you do not need a badge to go in.
<br>
There is a 1/5 scale model of the Hubble Space Telescope.  Turn left
<br>
at that model, walk straight ahead to the cafeteria.  The public is
<br>
allowed
<br>
in there, they have a great Vietnamese soup and sushi sometimes.  Come
<br>
on over, I will explain to you why I am a believer in the Space Based
<br>
Laser, and why technology is our friend.  Sincerely, spike jones
