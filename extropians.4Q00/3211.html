Replica polyvinyl transmission diffraction gratings are dirt cheap to
<br>
manufacture. Even with markup, you can go to a store like Nature Company
<br>
and get a transmission grating with some sort of &quot;handle&quot;/box for under
<br>
ten dollars, probably a lot less. Using CDs is good for simple
<br>
brightline stiff, but of course there are artifacts and limitations
<br>
compared to a &quot;real&quot; first surface reflection grating. Those are the
<br>
ones that cost big big bux.
<br>
<p>I definitely think mutispectral/multimode at high res would motivate me
<br>
to go gargoyle sooner rather than later.
