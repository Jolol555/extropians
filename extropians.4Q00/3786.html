Good job, Harvey!  
<br>
<p>Usually I look at this oft returning thread, swiftly and confidently
<br>
dispose of the conundrums, and move on.  But you made me think just a
<br>
little longer than usual.

<br>
<p><em>&gt;To further expound on this copy-question, try this thought experiment 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resulting in six different copies.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Number 1, dubbed &quot;the original&quot;, is a total amnesiac with no memory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whatsoever, but fingerprints indicate it is you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Number 2, dubbed &quot;the copy&quot;, is apparently you, looks exactly like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you, and has your exact memories and behavior mannerisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Number 3, dubbed &quot;the youth&quot;, is physically better off than you were, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but otherwise has your exact memories and behavior mannerisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Number 4, dubbed &quot;the simulation&quot;, is a computer-generated simulation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of you.  It is a projected picture on a computer screen that claims 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be you, and seems to have all your exact memories and mannerisms.
</em><br>
<p>Numbers 2, 3, and 4 are copies.  A copy is a copy.  It is preceeded by an
<br>
original.  That's what makes it a copy.  That the copy may think it's the
<br>
original, or that the world may think it's the original, simply means that
<br>
they are mistaken.  The fact that 2 and 3 are human, gives them full and
<br>
undiminished human rights.  But that can't alter their status as copies.
<br>
Get over it.
<br>
<p>Number 1 is all that remains of the real you.  The amnesia however, compels
<br>
a redefinition of the status of your existence in the sense that the
<br>
original has been 'damaged' or 'altered'.  Your body remains, but &quot;you&quot; are
<br>
gone.  Absent the material foundation of the old real you, and the
<br>
behavioral manifestations that authenticated the same, said 'you' is
<br>
history.  The fact that your old body is almost certain to provoke those
<br>
who once knew you as its occupant, to mistake the old package for the old
<br>
you, is merely a case of reasonable but nonetheless mistaken presumption.
<br>
(They'll soon realize their error if they get to know the new you and
<br>
compare with the old.) 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To carry this even further, imagine that the scientist loads your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;memories back into your meat brain, 
</em><br>
<p>This restores the original you,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and then replaces each neuron of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the original's brain with a machine neuron.  This is done one neuron 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at a time, and your brain keeps functioning while this is done.
</em><br>
<p>If you participate in this willingly, then the new you is the real you
<br>
regardless of how different the new you may be.  This is a transhumanist
<br>
event.  A voluntary self-transformation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Eventually, the original brain is completely replaced with mechanical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neurons.  Strangely, the mad scientist's assistant has reassembled 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the neurons into a completely functioning meat brain, and has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transplanted it into a monkey.  We now have:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Number 5, dubbed &quot;the android&quot;, with a completely mechanical brain, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with all your exact memories and mannerisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Number 6, dubbed &quot;the chimp&quot;, which looks like a chimp with a large 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brain pan, which seems to have all your exact memories and mannerisms.
</em><br>
<p>If the gradual androidization is forced on you against your will, then the
<br>
result is--if your meat brain is destroyed--a damaged version of you,
<br>
or--if your meat brain remains, or is recoverable--the real you, in fact or
<br>
potential, plus an unauthorized enhanced synthetic copy.  Kidnapping and
<br>
forced androidization is, in my view, violative of personal rights, and
<br>
both of the victims of the act, the original you (now in chimpish form) and
<br>
the android you have some serious complaints against the perpetrators.
<br>
Luckily the nature of the offenses seem to suggest that the options for
<br>
technological remediation are substantial and the prognosis good.
<br>
<p>If the androidization is voluntary, then the android you is, or should be,
<br>
contractually satisfied with his physiological enhancement, but the the
<br>
existence of the chimpish you creates an unexpected and undesired dilution
<br>
of identity rights.  The new you and the old you are equally desirous of
<br>
being the real you, but the old you has precedence.  The new you has been
<br>
deprived of the exclusive possession of the &quot;you&quot; persona, to which
<br>
exclusive possession he had had a reasonable expectation going into the
<br>
procedure, ie when he WAS you.  Now the old you is still the real you and
<br>
the new you is a 'mere' enhanced copy.  Bad break.     
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Which entity is &quot;you&quot;?  Any of them?  All of them?  Some of them?
</em><br>
<p>What I became aware of in this little exercise was that the issue of &quot;Who
<br>
is you?&quot; seems to separate in a rights issue and an identity issue, with
<br>
(if you don't rigorously segregate the two) the latter subordinate to the
<br>
former.  
<br>
<p>First you 'own' the rights to your identity and to choose whatever that
<br>
will be.  In the absence of personally-asserted first-person identity
<br>
rights, third-party-assessed identity authenticity is materially-based, and
<br>
a matter of degree.  Originality defines the highest degree of
<br>
authenticity, the original you in the original body, sliding gradually away
<br>
through amnesiac, comatose, brain-wiped, deanimate frozen, deanimate
<br>
decayed, the various permutations of copies, to urn of ashes and fading
<br>
photograph, and finally to a last fleeting wisp of memory.
<br>
<p>Thanks, Harvey.  That was fun.
