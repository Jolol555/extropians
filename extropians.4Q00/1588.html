<p><em>&gt;Hi Nick.

<em>&gt;Alright, let's play a hypothetical game.  Let us suppose that there was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent life on Mars.  ... explain how this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;second data point defeats the observational selection effect inherent in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anthropic principle.
</em><br>
<p>I think Curt and Eugene have already answered this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... Remember: no matter how small a fraction of all solar systems in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infinite universe develop life, we would by neccessity find that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Earthlings and Martians) originate from one of the exceptional ones that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;did.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but it would not be necessary that we would have found ourselves 
<br>
originating from a solar system where two civilizations had evolved 
<br>
independently. That is the extra finding that would make all the 
<br>
difference. If the evolution of intelligent life is very improbable then it 
<br>
would have been extremely unlikely that it would have happened on another 
<br>
planet in our own solar system. That would have been a remarkable 
<br>
coincidence. By contrast, it is no coincidence that we find intelligent 
<br>
life evolved &quot;here&quot;, because the &quot;here&quot; is not a random position in the 
<br>
universe: it is a random sample only from the set of positions where there 
<br>
are observers.
<br>
<p>I hope that we will not find any signs of advanced life forms in our solar 
<br>
system or elsewhere. The deader Mars is, the better. Advanced life would 
<br>
show that the Great Filter is probably not in our past, so we'd have to 
<br>
fear it in our future.
<br>
<p>The Fermi paradox is not really a paradox. I know of no arguments why 
<br>
anybody should expect intelligent life to have been common in the universe. 
<br>
The only thing that our own existence shows is that the improbability of 
<br>
intelligent life evolving on a given planet is not so great that the total 
<br>
probability of at least some life evolving somewhere in the universe is 
<br>
small. But if the universe is very big (especially if it's infinite) then 
<br>
this does not place any constraint at all on the probability of a given 
<br>
planet evolving intelligent life: even if it's extremely small, it was 
<br>
still probable that intelligent life would evolve somewhere.
