</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, yes.  But that's the question as it's asked.  (Or, more
<br>
commenly, asserted about us in flames.)  The answer should be calm and
<br>
reasoned; same as we should treat the question about whether
<br>
Extropianism is a cult.
<br>
<p>&quot;Cult&quot; leaves a bad taste in your mouth, too.  ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  - What do extropians think about &quot;genetically modified&quot; crops, foods,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    etc?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  - What do extropians think about mysticism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is where the dangerous ground begins to be tread.  I've written five 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different reasons why, and realized that each one of them would eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degenerate into flaming.  And I think that alone should make the point.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not mean that we endorse such odd &quot;psuedo-theories&quot; as the healing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power of prayer, or &quot;creation science&quot;.  The personal, though, should remain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such.
</em><br>
<p>MOST of the FAQ answers say:
<br>
<p>Q What do extropians think about such-and-such?
<br>
<p>A Extropianism does not dictate any particular answer to this
<br>
question.  Many extropians believe that such-and-such is good, for the
<br>
following reasons.  Others deny this, for these reasons.  However, all
<br>
of us agree that blah-blah-blah.
<br>
<p>I'd imagined that these two questions would go like that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I admire the notion of trying to summarize past debates on these subjects,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I've seen this done on other email lists and newsgroups for many years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the fact is that the peopel who already are here and have their own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions on these subjects will continue to espouse them at a low level, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subconsciously eliciting responses from newcomers who have not been in on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these debates prior and who will 99% of the time not pause to read the FAQ 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or any other supportin documentation before replying and rehashing the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguement over and over again.  This is particularly dangerous in areas that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arouse strict partisan responses and emotions, such as the &quot;faith/belief&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question or the thrice-damned gun discussions.  
</em><br>
<p>I, too, have seen this done before, but I found the results to be at
<br>
least mildly successful; not in curbing discussion, but in elevating
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>I'm not supposing that some FAQ answer will put an end to frequently
<br>
debated topics.  Rather, starting from a certain basic level of
<br>
knowledge about the usual arguments can elevate the intelligence and
<br>
novelty of debate quite a bit, especially when newbies are pointed
<br>
directly at the FAQ when it appears that they haven't read it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Somethign that meets similar ideas might be a set of questions that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describe extropian ideals as a series of positions on issues - things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it beneficial for people to live twice their current life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expectancy at the same or better quality?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are space habitats and permanent settlement off the earth possible and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desireable?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should some scientific inquiry be stymied because of ite potentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upsetting effect on society?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shoul dhuman beings be able to make genetic modifications to themselves and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their children?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other questions like this can be approached to present a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructive, rather than detructive, view.  Rather than presenting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an arguentative view on modern issues (and one can say this with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainty: most extropians have diverse and strongly-held opinions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on most major modern issues), a more forward-looking, futurist view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be expressed, focusing attention where it needs to be.
</em><br>
<p>These are good questions, too...  Some of these questions, I think,
<br>
have already been adequately covered by the Transhumanist FAQ at
<br>
www.transhumanism.org.  Maybe we could/should quote from it liberally,
<br>
as it's a rather well written document, IMO.
