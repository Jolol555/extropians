<em>&gt; (They believe the Earth is flat, because the Bible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; mentions &quot;the four corners of the Earth&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I recall something about the &quot;4 winds&quot; but don't recall ever reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything about 4 corners (at least not in the KJV), and I think something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like that would have stuck with me.  Anybody know whether there is really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a ref in the good book?
</em><br>
<p>Rev. 7:1  And after all these things I saw four angels standing
<br>
on the four corners of the earth, and holding four winds of
<br>
the earth...
<br>
<p>This is of course ambiguous, for it is unclear if the revelator
<br>
saw four angels on *each* corner, each holding four winds?
<br>
So it is impossible to tell if there are four winds, or sixteen
<br>
or sixty four.  Either way, thats a buncha wind.  Moving on:
<br>
<p>Isaiah 11:12.  And he shall set up an ensign for the nations,
<br>
and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together
<br>
the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
<br>
<p>So, they get an ensign to collect all the Jewish nerds.  Seems
<br>
like they could at least pop for a first leutenant.
<br>
<p>Before we conclude anything, the same book a few chapters over sez:
<br>
<p>Isaiah 40.22.  It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth,
<br>
and the inhabitants are as grasshoppers; the stretcheth out the
<br>
heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in...
<br>
<p>...Which is also the only place in the KJV that the word circle
<br>
appears.  So the earth has four corners and is a circle.  Obviously
<br>
they thought the earth was shaped like a cylinder, eh?  spike
