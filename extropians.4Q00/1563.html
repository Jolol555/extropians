A French company called &quot;ZERO POLLUTION MOTORS Inc.&quot; apparently has
<br>
developed a motor that runs on compressed air. A little data:
<br>
<p>range:  200km (120 miles) for only 30 US cents.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using 300 liters of compressed air  (300 bar)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 hours in an urban environment at an average speed of 80km/h.
<br>
refill: 4 hours in a 220 V plug at home, 3 min at servicestation compressor.
<br>
price:  $10,000
<br>
weight: 700 kg
<br>
Max Speed: 130km/h (aprox. 85 miles/h)
<br>
<p>This technology sounds a little to good to be true, but I don't know enough
<br>
physics to be able to se through it easily.
<br>
<p>Is it possible to compress enough air and keep it in tanks small enough to
<br>
fit into a car?
<br>
<p>Here is a link from the BBC:

<br>
<p>And the companys own website:
<br>
<a href="http://www.zeropollution.com/zeropollution/about_us.html">http://www.zeropollution.com/zeropollution/about_us.html</a>
<br>
<p>If something like this was for real it would have a huge socio economical
<br>
influence on the world.
