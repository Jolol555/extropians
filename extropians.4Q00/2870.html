Being so far behind and out of sync in my correspondence, I won't try to 
<br>
respond to specific posts here, but I would like to just comment on the 
<br>
general subject matter.  As a scientific rationalist, I strongly reject most 
<br>
claims to TRUTH made by mystics.  However, I think it would be a serious 
<br>
mistake to conclude that there is no real value in studying or even &quot;using&quot; 
<br>
much of the pre-scientific symbolic substrate we inherit in our cultural 
<br>
patrimony.  Having spent a good deal of time when I was younger reading Carl 
<br>
Jung and also having read widely (but not deeply, in most instances) 
<br>
regarding the various Western pre-Christian and Asian religious and mystical 
<br>
traditions, I believe there IS much of value in understanding and even 
<br>
&quot;playing with&quot; such ideas.
<br>
<p>The human mind is a complex, evolved system. We evolved as emotional beings 
<br>
and developed an array of genetically and memetically inherited heuristics to 
<br>
deal with a complex world that did not come with a user's manual.  Symbolic 
<br>
systems that evolved in this milieu conveyed some survival value on the 
<br>
humans that came to adopt them.  Now, of course, any such system was heavily 
<br>
context-dependent, so they can become counter-adaptive if the physical or 
<br>
cultural environment changes faster than the systems themselves can evolve.  
<br>
But elements of such systems that have persisted or independently evolved 
<br>
across cultures are worth studying, both for what they teach us about our own 
<br>
heritage and current nature and also for what they might reveal in terms of 
<br>
real wisdom that may be highly independent of specific context.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species.&quot;
