Give one to teh FDA for consistency, at the very least.  According to their 
<br>
determination process. StarLink has &quot;not et been approved for human 
<br>
consumption&quot;.  It's the same standard that it applies to drugs when it 
<br>
tests for ssafety and efficacy.  If it's not yet gotten the &quot;human use&quot; seal
<br>
of approval, you can use it for animals, but not on people.
<br>
<p>The arguement about allergies is semantic - We are talking about two different
<br>
types of allergies here.  Anyone who suffers hay fever may think that it's 
<br>
the end of te world - but unless you've gone into allergic shock from exposure
<br>
to something in your food (or a beesting), you don't know anything about what
<br>
&quot;allergic&quot; really means in the health arena.  Food allergies are serious 
<br>
things, not the sort of sniffles and congestion caused commonly by ragweed 
<br>
pollen, animal dander, or dust mites.  
<br>
<p>The way I understand it, the concern with the StarLink corn has to do with a
<br>
gene from a bacillus that is toxic to insects, but non-toxic to most mammals.
<br>
The problem is that in some percentage of the population, this protein that is
<br>
toxic to insects can cause allergic reactions of varying strengths, up to and
<br>
including anaphylactic (sp?) shock.  The FDA has not done enough testing on
<br>
human beings to find out whether or not this gene expresses the specific 
<br>
protein that causes this allergic reaction.
<br>
<p>On the same score, I'm not a proponent for making things 100% safe - that's 
<br>
never going to happen.  But just like we have little notes on most everything
<br>
that i contains phenylalanine, we could have a similar designation, if the
<br>
fear of allergic reaction proves founded.

<p><em>&gt; As some of you may have noticed already, the FDA has forced Mission to recall a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather large list of corn products sold under Kraft license, not for any actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence that it is unsafe, but because the products have been found to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been tainted by StarLink variety corn. The EPA has no actual proof that human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumption is harmful, but has concerns that people with certain allergies may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have reactions to the corn varietal (if the EPA is now an allergy regulatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body, thats the first that I've heard of it, I want cats, ragweed, and dust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mites outlawed pronto), as if discomfort is somehow to be equated with harm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (hell, Al Gore discomforts me, and I don't see a superfund site sign on him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (though I'm sure thats what all the soft money is for))
