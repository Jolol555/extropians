That is also true, good standard test scores can impress admission committees.
<br>
<p>GPA's can vary all over the place. I have had students with A's in English
<br>
composition who could not read. We had to send them to English as a second
<br>
language programs even though English was their first and only language!
<br>
<p>Good Luck
<br>
