<em>&gt;Interesting.  Did the other 10 give any indication of why they would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;upload?  Given that the original remained intact, I am somewhat surprised
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that so many would turn the offer down.

<em>&gt;	From: Robin Hanson
</em><br>
<em>&gt;	This last week I told my microeconomics students about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;	some of the economics of uploading this week.  I asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;	how many of them would be willing to make an upload
</em><br>
<em>&gt;	copy of themselves (assuming their original remained intact).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;	Five out of fifteen of them said they would.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't upload whether the original was left intact or not.
<br>
If the original is not left intact - then what's the point? I am leaving 
<br>
ever thought and a duplicate of my consciousness behind for the world, but 
<br>
for me it does nothing.
<br>
If the original (me) is left intact, then this creates a number of legal 
<br>
issues between me and the duplicate, and even if those are resolved there 
<br>
are problems for me if I had a duplicate walking around. Right now, I pretty 
<br>
much have a monopoly on all my ideas. Much of my future success in 
<br>
implementing them depends on someone else not beating me to it. If there's 
<br>
another me, he may beat me to it.
