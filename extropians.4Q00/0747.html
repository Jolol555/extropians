<p>That would very much depend on whether the new thing is seen as being as
<br>
good or better than the current thing.  It is one thing for the human
<br>
race to be replaced by advanced transhumans or SI[s].  It is quite
<br>
another to be replaced by grey goo.   
<br>
<p>I don't know the answer yet but I think part of such conundrums is that
<br>
we expect everything to be a survival of the fittest type of game
<br>
indefinitely. Perhaps it always perforce will be but I hold out the hope
<br>
that that is not the only way things can play out.  
<br>
<p>Even within the strictly human realm we can't manage to really be happy
<br>
for each other's success or especially each other's greater ability in
<br>
some area or another without part of our mind worrying that we are 
<br>
becoming obsolete or at a serious disadvantage.  IMHO this seriously
<br>
hobbles humanity's ability to grow.  Too much energy is spent protecting
<br>
territory and fighting against the new, the upstart.  Things are too
<br>
geared towards competitive anxiety rather than rejoicing over the
<br>
richness of shared abilities and resources.
