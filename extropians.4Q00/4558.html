<em>&gt; Oh dear, science largely developed from philosophy and if you want to

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No one here has taking the time to define &quot;philosophy,&quot; so it's kind of
<br>
premature to dismiss it in toto.  I would offer a rough definition of it as
<br>
general ideas about reality -- often presented in a systematic form.  To
<br>
expand on this, we could look at the various branches of philosophy, each of
<br>
which focuses on specific aspects or parts of reality, such as metaphysics,
<br>
epistemology, ethics, esthetics, and so on.
<br>
<p>Given this definition, philosophy is not limited to cute puzzles like that
<br>
of Theseus' Ship, but undergirds other areas too, such as science.  It's not
<br>
that science gets its start from philosophy, science is _grounded in_
<br>
philosophy.  Yes, science relies, to a large but not total degree, on
<br>
empirical work, but this is a philosophy too -- i.e., the view that
<br>
empirical work has some degree of validity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Actually, pancritical rationalism in some sense makes scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foundations at somewhat empirical, but you still have to do some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical thinking there)
</em><br>
<p>See my short piece on pancritical rationalism at
<br>
<a href="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/PCR.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/PCR.html</a>  No one on the list has
<br>
challenged my attack on pancritical rationalism...  yet!:)

<p>Cheers!
