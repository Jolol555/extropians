<p><p>I am not a proponent of Turing police or even regulation; besides being a
<br>
fruitless strategy, I disagree with it on principle.  I don't even really
<br>
care what an AI is used for as long as it doesn't bother me.   However, I
<br>
am not at all convinced that someone won't end up pulling a fantastically
<br>
stupid stunt given the opportunity; note that I apply this to a whole
<br>
range of technologies, not just AI.  I wouldn't bother to guess what that
<br>
stunt may be, but there certainly would be plenty of opportunity to
<br>
encounter new classes of unpleasant problems with AIs running around. 
<br>
Unlike many other technologies though, it would be far easier to
<br>
inadvertently make a mess with AI.  Ambitious monkeys like to push the
<br>
envelope of questionable usage first, *then* decide whether it was a good
<br>
or moral idea in the first place. 
<br>
<p>The evolution of the situation is a bit more complex than has generally
<br>
been presented (Hal Finney touched on this well IMO), and could very well
<br>
end up with some difficult trajectories.
<br>
<p>For example, one plausible trajectory is that an AI arms race will occur.
<br>
I expect AI intelligence levels to follow a (relatively) slow
<br>
evolutionary pattern, since I don't forsee the development of a
<br>
super-intelligent AI overnight nor see any reason why this should be the
<br>
case.  The strategic advantage of having an AI that expands at the most
<br>
voracious pace a government can manage (yet still theoretically control),
<br>
with the goal of bolstering its position at the detriment of other
<br>
governments' AIs would be an interesting and highly dynamic situation.
<br>
<p>While I am not a big space nut by any means, I find something wrong with a
<br>
picture where one has the resources of a good AI (and all the capital that
<br>
would go along with that) but still can't find a way to get off the planet
<br>
in a sustainable manner. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; For the record, as Eliezer described, SIAI does not plan for the kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half-assed deployment scheme you indirectly attribute.
</em><br>
<p><p>Good for you.  When I look at the history of technological development and
<br>
the various evolutionary, social, and political trajectories those
<br>
technologies actually took, the landscape isn't as clear cut as many of the
<br>
implicit assumptions we use would make it seem.  I wasn't trying to single
<br>
anyone out. I was trying to make the point that historically most
<br>
scientists have a very poor track record for having a technology follow
<br>
their intent rather than the intent of those with buckets of money and
<br>
lots of power (such as governments).  Having a comprehensive deployment
<br>
strategy and contingency plan well ahead of time goes a long way towards
<br>
heading off these types of issues.
