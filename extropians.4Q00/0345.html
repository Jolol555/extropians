N and Eugene,
<br>
<p>Have you read Dr Robert D. Hare's fascinating book &quot;Without Conscience, the
<br>
disturbing world of the psychopaths among us&quot;? ( psychopath and sociopath
<br>
are interchangeable terms)
<br>
<p>Some interesting points, according to his studies:
<br>
- There may be lots of psychopaths, many of whom never do anything too
<br>
monstrous, (they just become politicians)
<br>
- Psychopath's EEG's show certain irregularties (weird-wiring)
<br>
- Psychopaths fail to recognize pain in other beings, in fact, they aren't
<br>
conscience of the reality of other beings, period.
<br>
(as I recall, genetic markers were not identified but I will check)
<br>
<p>If Psychopaths are born and not made, can they be held responsible for
<br>
their crimes? Should children be screend for 'weird wiring'?
<br>

<em> &gt; It is a small percentage of killers who are psychotic in ways that are
</em><br>
<em> &gt; genetically predisposed. That behavior is predominately germinated, usually
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt; killers&quot; it's too late to chat about why, rehabilition is pretty much
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Eugene responded in part:
<br>
|Yeah, essentially one has to screen for them, and isolate them from
<br>

<br>
|justice would demand to kill such people on the spot, as soon as they
<br>
|manifest their pathological symptoms, but we're too civilized for that).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; IMO the laws today treat children as property - making it difficult to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; intervene in abuse situations. For purely selfish reasons (I'd like less
</em><br>
<em> &gt; violent offenders and predators) I would prefer if children were NOT
</em><br>
treated
<br>
<em> &gt; as property but rather as human beings with rights.
</em><br>
<p>So, are you saying that one learns respect by being respected? How would
<br>
you describe the worst parenting mistakes? Treating kids like 'property'
<br>
that is, as things?
<br>
<p>Someone mentioned having a 'childhood in hell' - What things did your
<br>
parents do? Fail to do?
