<em>&gt; Wow. Tremendous post. What a perfect example of eactly what we are up

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Though I admire the depth of vision and imaginative genius on display in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;this work I have many problems with its philosophical underpinnings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Broderick, and the scientists he discusses, seem to have little conception
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am stunned almost speechless by the depth of the gulf between his thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ours. When I hear someone who is apparently educated and well-read make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this statement, and realize that the vast majority of humans share his
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I do not see why the above invokes this strong or one-sided a response. 
<br>
Before the current age of science old age and death were very much
<br>
necessary parts of human life cycle as they are very much necessary
<br>
parts of the life cycle of other species that propagate by sexual
<br>
reproduction.  It is only by becoming bright enough to go beyond mere
<br>
biology and natural selection that this becomes no longer the case. 
<br>
There is some deep bonding to the birth, life, death cycle in creatures
<br>
such as we.  It will not be instantaneous that many see it and go beyond
<br>
it.  Have some compassion for your fellow creature's difficulty with
<br>
this.  Go writing them off and they will simply write you off, perhaps
<br>
in worse ways than simply ignoring you.
