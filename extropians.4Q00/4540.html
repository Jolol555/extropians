<br>
<em>&gt;      Thesius's ship should be preserved, since it is a peice of Greek
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history. They keep it docked, but it starts to decay. Every time a peice
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; wood decays even a bit, it is replaced with a freh board. Eventually,
</em><br>
every
<br>
<em>&gt; board has been replaced. Is it still Thesius's ship? If no, at what point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was it no longer that ship? When did it lose it's &quot;Thesius's ship&quot;-ness?
</em><br>
<p>It is still Thesius' ship. If you want to know how, observe the workers
<br>
replacing the decayed boards with fresh boards. If you want to know when and
<br>
where, pay attention to these details. If you want to know whose ship it is,
<br>
find Thesius' descendents and heirs. If you want to know why, you're a
<br>
philosopher, and Thesius probably wouldn't want you on the ship.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, a scrap dealer stumbles upon all the semi-rotting wood which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been removed from Thesius's ship. He takes it, and, since it's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely rotten, he actually assembles a ship from it, he has
</em><br>
re-assmbled
<br>
<em>&gt; Thesius's original ship. He docks it next to the first ship. Which one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really Thesius's ship?
</em><br>
<p>If you were paying attention to the how, and where, and when, and whose
<br>
relating to Thesius' ship, then you'd know that Thesius (or his
<br>
preservationist descendents, if he's dead) still has his reconstructed ship,
<br>
and that the scrap dealer has the rotten original ship. No mystery there.
<br>
<p>None of this requires philosophy. It just needs observation, direct
<br>
experience to verify facts, and empirical evidence to ascertain correct
<br>
identities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Someone came to give a philosophy talk at the college I went to and argued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they both are, and that this teaches us something about objects and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space. His hypothesis was that this proves that an object can be in two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; places at the same time. Amazing! Thesius's ship was in two places at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same time, docked right next to eachother.
</em><br>
<p>That helps to explain why some people call it &quot;fool-osophy.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The reason this peice of philosophy is valuable is because it takes
</em><br>
&quot;common
<br>
<em>&gt; sense&quot; hidden assumptions about the nature of objects and applies it to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem, which leads to a nonsensical result and shows that the common
</em><br>
sense
<br>
<em>&gt; assumptions about objects, the premises by which most people think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objects, are false. If you're a good philosopher, you're going to figure
</em><br>
out
<br>
<em>&gt; why these wrong questions are the wrong questions.
</em><br>
<p>Nice try, but no kewpie doll. This piece of sh...  excuse me, this piece of
<br>
philosophy is worthless because it pretends to offer solutions, but
<br>
(un)common sense reveals more valuable information. The advantage of
<br>
(un)common sense (sense is really not that common) is that it doesn't lead
<br>
to nonsensical results. When you come to your senses (stop philosophizing),
<br>
things look much more clear. If you're a good philosopher, you'll keep
<br>
asking the wrong questions to insure that you don't run out of work.
<br>
<p>To me, science is the most uncommon kind of sense. Especially 21st century
<br>
science, because it requires the greatest precision and accuracy in
<br>
empirical experiments that humans have ever attempted. I mean, super
<br>
colliders and space telescopes are fairly uncommon. You need hardware to do
<br>
science.
<br>
<p>This reminds me of an Edelman story. Apparently the science department was
<br>
in trouble because it had such a huge expense account. The math department
<br>
bragged that it only needed chalk, paper, and a few waste paper baskets. But
<br>
the philosophy department did even better. They didn't even need waste
<br>
baskets. Get it? The philosophers didn't throw out their wrong questions.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
