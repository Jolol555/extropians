<p>That reminds me... 
<br>
<p>Anecdotal Case of Unconscious Extro-Therapy
<br>
<p>The individual to whom I'll refer might not be out of the danger zone
<br>
yet, and I can't talk about too many details. Let's just say he's been
<br>
very, very seriously depressed and I don't think any of his housemates,
<br>
myself included, ever suspected it. They still don't know, but he told
<br>
me some scary stuff he was contemplating. He could have gone on to
<br>
become one of those newspaper stories where acquaintances get quoted as
<br>
saying &quot;I don't know what happened. He seemed like such a well adjusted
<br>
guy!&quot;
<br>
<p>Normally I'm against haphazard proselytizing. Recruiting people who
<br>
arlready are Extropians and just don't know it yet is one thing. Trying
<br>
to turn mundanes into Extropians is best left to professionals. More
<br>
power to you if you know how to do it, I choose not to mess with it. On
<br>
the other hand, here was a guy sitting accross from me telling me he saw
<br>
no purpose in life and no point in remaining alive. What else am I
<br>
supposed to do besides tell him what the purpose and meaning is, as I
<br>
see it?
<br>
<p>So first, I asked him about what his happiest memories were. What he'd do
<br>
with his time if he didn't have to do anything at all. So we established
<br>
a baseline for how he'd like things to be. It's hard to maintain a 
<br>
nihilist death spiral when there are specific events that made you happy
<br>
and specific situations where you can see yourself being happy again.
<br>
Now instead of being hopeless and insurmountable, the things that are
<br>
bothering you are reduced to mere obstacles standing between yourself
<br>
and the happy things you've just articulated.
<br>
<p>I briefly went over Existentialsm Plus, the Millenial Edition [1].
<br>
<p>Then, I reminded him just how quickly the world has changed even during
<br>
his own (young, oh so young) life. He acknowledged that yeah, it was
<br>
pretty unbelievable. I pointed out that the pace of change keeps
<br>
accelerating. He agreed that that made sense. So I start slowly
<br>
working in biotech, nanotech, and AI. Kind of makes one curious to find
<br>
out what happens next, doesn't it? Especially if one has a chance to
<br>
live long enough to see it happen. Would kind of suck to die and then
<br>
have godhood acchieved through technological means a few exponentially
<br>
advancing years later, wouldn't it? Which brought the conversation
<br>
back to the meaning and purpose thing. Existentialism Plus is all fine
<br>
and good, but (many) people still yearn for 'something higher'. That's
<br>
what all this meaning and purpose stuff might be rationalizing... that
<br>
we want mystery in our life, a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
<br>
Something to keep the taxes and homework and parking tickets and
<br>
hangovers and breakups and rejections and colds in perspective.
<br>
<p>This man's own mystery happened to have burned out, so I tried to give
<br>
him a jump-start off mine which must be pretty resilient, considering
<br>
what it's allowed me to soldier on through.
<br>
<p>Obviously, biochemical imbalances can't be stably fixed by reasoning
<br>
alone. I got him to promise me to see a shrink and start taking his
<br>
medication again. But the slow ramping up from the crappy and pointless
<br>
reality of right now (for him anyway) to the bright shining, fanciful
<br>
yet oddly persuasive future... maybe that helped momentarily get him
<br>
out of the dumps and bring him up to the energy level where he could
<br>
motivate himself to take the next step and seek professional help.
<br>
Philosophical first aid.
<br>
<p>So will he be joining the Extropy list anytime soon? I doubt it (I HOPE
<br>
not, because otherwise I'll have a lot of explaining to do). However,
<br>
our memes touched his life and (again, I hope) made it better. I mean,
<br>
at least he's still around and has actually started socializing with 
<br>
the rest of the house again.
<br>
<p><p>Footnote:
<br>
[1] Existentialism Plus
<br>
<p>Here's the standard existentialism portion, that for some reason
<br>
everyone who uses the word 'existentilism' seens unable to articulate
<br>
in a concise manner.
<br>
<p>1. The universe has no inherent meaning or purpose or even truth. All
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is relative.
<br>
2. However, it's self evident that you need meaning, purpose, and truth.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this relative universe you still need a stable point of reference.
<br>
3. You are free to make up your own meaning, purpose, and truth. Put
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your pencil anywhere on the grid you like, and make that your point
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of reference. Who cares if you're pulling it out of your arse? The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buck has to stop somewhere.
<br>
<p>Here's the Plus portion, public domain courtesy of yours truly.
<br>
<p>4. Actually, its unlikely that whatever meaning, purpose, and truth you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come up with will be completely random. Billions of years of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evolution have hard-wired certain values into your neural circuitry.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Values that you have in common with every other living organism,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regardless of sentience level. Certainly your own species. These
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;values can't help but influence the 'arbitrary' axioms you impose
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onto the universe. The more these axioms are in concordance with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the values evolution has put into you, the less cognitive dissonance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll suffer, and the more easily your newly concieved axioms will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;influence other people.
<br>
5. You can even make the process of deriving your own personal axioms
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faster and more efficient by studying your underlying, deep-seated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drives and making sure that your 'arbitrary' axioms are consistant
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with them to begin with. As I said, this will also make your belief
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system more stable.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Get out the map, get out the map, lay your finger anywhere down.
<br>
&nbsp;We'll leave the figuring to those we pass on our way out of town.
<br>
&nbsp;Don't drink the water there seems to be something ailing everyone.
<br>
&nbsp;I'm gonna clear my head, I'm gonna drink that sun.
<br>
&nbsp;I'm gonna love you good and strong while our love is good and young.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Indigo Girls
