Ha, you think you had it bad. I didn't have a 'we' to discuss the
<br>
possibility of nothing, or worse, or dimensions, or any of that other
<br>
new fangled stuff you young-uns seem so blase about. There was just me,
<br>
no 'we'. I tell you, it was maddening, maddening. Because there wasn't
<br>
anything but me, I had no concept of where I began and me ended, since
<br>
it was all me. Was I just a figment of me's imagination? Was I here
<br>
merely as an accident, or for my own edification? I did develop this
<br>
theory of Mepomorphic Principle, that if I wasn't here to ponder at me's
<br>
own existence, I wouldn't be here at all, but then I came up with the
<br>
Multi-Me Theory, that every thought I had was only one possible thought
<br>
out of a sheaf of an infinite number of possible thoughts, so in reality
<br>
one thought was as good as another, and so I started modeling many
<br>
possible me's. Of course, I needed someplace to model all possible
<br>
me's.....
