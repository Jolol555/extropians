<p>Well, we've managed to do away with or ignore markedly smarter men than we are.

The history of enlightened masters is the history of the containment of markedly
<br>
smarter entities than we are.

<p><em>&gt; Aside from various cybernetic McGuyver scenarios (in which the AI

</em><br>
<p>I'm convinced already. Let it out... Oh, please, let it out. I'm tired of having
<br>
society run by morons with great haircuts. And I really don't look forward to
<br>
another holocaust caused by anti-AI Fundamentalists and religionists.

&quot;Please, Sir. May reason have another chance?&quot;

<p><em>&gt; There are any number of ways it could try to do that, and eventually,

<em>&gt; it would probably succeed, especially if the arguments it was making
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; harm with a web browser...
</em><br>
<p>Doubtful it could do anywhere near as much harm as humans who have waged five
<br>
thousand wars in the last three thousand years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In principle, you could take the AI and give it no means of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; your AI into a giant space heater.  You might as well terminate it;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; YOU'RE not doing anything with it.
</em><br>
<p>Right on. What would un-augmented anti-transhumanists do with pure (a.k.a.
<br>
artificial) intelligence? They really don't have any use for understanding,
<br>
reason, and knowledge, since they have all the answers in their sacred texts.

<p><p><p>&quot;There is always inequity in life. Some men are killed in a war and some men are

wounded, and some men never leave the country. . . . It's very hard in military
