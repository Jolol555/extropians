</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't know whether ExI's membership page is misleading - I haven't been
<br>
there lately - but I can't possibly believe that they make you believe you'll
<br>
get $55 worth of coffee mugs or email newsletters.  Almost all charities focus
<br>
on worthy causes, not membership benefits, with the rare exceptions being
<br>
member-run organizations that charge a small fee to support services like
<br>
newsletters and such.  It should hopefully be clear that ExI is not just a
<br>
bunch of Extropians who got together; no, they're out to change the world. 
<br>
For organizations like ExI, the real benefit of membership is (a) the altruism
<br>
and (b) being able to say you're a member.  Don't underrate that last part! 
<br>
The Extropy Institute is respected in some pretty interesting circles, and
<br>
being a member of the Extropy Institute is more than being just another person
<br>
who likes transhumanism - it's like the difference between voting Libertarian
<br>
and being a member of the Libertarian Party.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, now that I think about, it isn't all that hard to imagine
<br>
someone mistaking the Extropy Institute for a membership-oriented organization
<br>
- it's called &quot;Extropy&quot; and here are all these people called &quot;Extropians&quot;.  So
<br>
ExI might need to update the Web pages, make that clearer.   &quot;Your membership
<br>
dollars go to support ExI's continuing efforts in the front lines of the
<br>
public relations battle for technology.&quot;
<br>
<p>Also, I must say that I also felt a little ignored when I sent in my $55.  A
<br>
quarterly newsletter delivered via email would go a long way to ameliorate the
<br>
feeling-ignored factor.   And can I renew my voice in the long-standing chorus
<br>
asking for an Extropian search service?  It'd be nice to know if there are any
<br>
other Extropians here in Atlanta.
