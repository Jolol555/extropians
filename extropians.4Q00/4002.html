</em><br>
<em>&gt; which describes ancient Indian knowledge of the speed of light:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this is one more april fools joke. the speed of light was not first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; calculated by measuring the time differences that light took to travel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from Io to Earth in the 1600's depending on whether it was moving toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or going away from earth (how would they measure these times? The could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only have done so by redshift of spectral lines, which would have given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; us relativity long before Einstein).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, it's clearly not an April Fool's joke.  The abstract reads,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      We survey early Indian ideas on the speed of light and the size
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      of the universe. A context is provided for Sayana's statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      (14th century)that the speed is 2,202 yojanas per half nimesha
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      (186,000 miles per second!). It is shown how this statement may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      have emerged from early Puranic notions regarding the size of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      the universe. Although this value can only be considered to be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      amazing coincidence, the Puranic cosmology at the basis of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      assertion illuminates many ancient ideas of space and time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the author himself is claiming only that this value is a coincidence.
</em><br>
<p><p>I wonder.  It would not be terribly surprising to me if humans were
<br>
advanced enough to know this at one time and then regressed (perhaps
<br>
with the help of some major cataclysms) to a point where even that such
<br>
existed earlier was only legend with no physical evidence (so far). 
<br>
India especially has legends of humans and gods (transhumans, aliens?)
<br>
flying about in flying machines (vimanas) and cast bolts of energy and
<br>
missles of devasting power at one another.  Very interesting.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, the story about measuring the speed of light in the 1600's is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real.  You don't measure redshift due to Io's motion; you measure the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference in travel times due to the Earth's motion around the sun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth is 16 light-minutes closer to Jupiter at one point in its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbit than six months later, and so the measured interval between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Io's orbits would slow for 6 months and then speed up for another 6.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An astronomer correctly deduced that this was because of light taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more time to get to the Earth at some points in its orbit than at others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See <a href="http://www.phys.virginia.edu/classes/109N/lectures/spedlite.html">http://www.phys.virginia.edu/classes/109N/lectures/spedlite.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for discussion on early measurements of the speed of light.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So this makes it even more likely that the speed of light was known in
<br>
India quite some time ago.
