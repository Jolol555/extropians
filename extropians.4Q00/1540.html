<em>&gt; &gt; I still think you're over-estimating the good being done by ExI

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Its also different because money put into ExI works as a catalyst to encourage
<br>
more and more of the population to think positively about technology and the
<br>
future, and for them to invest in the things we want accomplished. Exi money
<br>
works as the fulcrum upon which the vast capital in our society can be levered.
<br>
Every time someone like Max, Ralph, Marvin, Natasha, Robin, etc. gets a chance
<br>
to promulgate extropic memes in the media, in the classroom, or on the web, it
<br>
helps to innoculate more and more people against luddite thinking.
