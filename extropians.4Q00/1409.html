<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that I may no longer be a member of the ExI.  The reason I am 
<br>
not sure is that there is no difference between being a member and not being 
<br>
a member -- except that it costs more to be a member, of course.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are probably those on this list who consider joining the ExI.  I 
<br>
would therefore like to warn them: since you get nothing for your money if 
<br>
you send it to the ExI, you might as well flush it down the toilet.  I am 
<br>
certain that you can use that money better.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sent in the membership fee the 15th of April last year.  Those who 
<br>
consider becoming members might wonder what I have received from the ExI 
<br>
during my one year of membership.  That won't take long to tell:  I have 
<br>
received nothing from the ExI during my year as a member.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that &quot;happened&quot; was nothing -- that is, I couldn't 
<br>
even get any confirmation that my membership fee had actually reached the 
<br>
ExI.  Eventually I started sending emails to people whose address was on the 
<br>
Extropy site, asking if they had received the money.  Still nothing.  No 
<br>
reply.  After half a year of sending emails to people who according to the 
<br>
Extropy site were representatives of the ExI, I finally received 
<br>
confirmation that my money had indeed arrived, and that I was registered as 
<br>
a member.  That was all.  Then nothing again.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's it.  That is all you get as a member of the ExI: if you pester 
<br>
them enough you may eventually receive confirmation that you are a member, 
<br>
and that is all you will receive.  I don't know if the money you send in 
<br>
goes straight to Max More's own pocket.  He seems like a nice enough fellow, 
<br>
and I find it hard to believe that he is running this thing just as a way to 
<br>
make money on the poor suckers who send in money to the ExI.  I do know what 
<br>
that money is NOT used for, however.  It is not used to pay for printing and 
<br>
distributing the Extropy magazine to ExI members.  In fact, I seriously 
<br>
doubt that that
<br>
money goes to anything that benefits ExI members.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, if you are thinking of applying for membership and sending 
<br>
money to ExI, DON'T DO IT!.  Treat yourself to something nice for that money 
<br>
instead.  You won't receive anything at all for your money if you send it to 
<br>
the ExI.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian Arcatling
