<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; It's interesting to consider that greater knowledge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; how societies function, assuming such knowledge is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; obtainable, implies a higher degree of centralisation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; It's also worth noting that greater freedom may well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; come from government-centred solutions as opposed free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; market solutions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why would either of these assertions have any basis?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A trivial example: Not every possible product is released
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the marketplace to compete; a large number of potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product designs are dismissed or not even considered.  An
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase in the intelligence or knowledge of the product
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designer(s) would result in a greater number of designs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being dismissed or not considered before production.
</em><br>
<p>This does not imply any sort of centralization at all, it merely is a
<br>
sign of smart minds thinking alike.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An increase in knowledge about the marketplace results in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the centralisation of decision making in the design process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consumers making purchasing decisions cannot necessarily use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same knowledge to their advantage.  The same is true of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge about society, which by necessity must be formed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a centralised perspective.  Purposeful design, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible, will always be superior to spontaneous order (if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it isn't designed, it's badly designed).
</em><br>
<p>Your claim about purposeful design is a tautology which has no basis,
<br>
and which state of the art research in evolved design is quickly putting
<br>
to rest as obsolete.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A society purposefully designed (and therefore &quot;governed&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for freedom will offer greater freedom than an anarchy.
</em><br>
<p>There is a significant difference between a design and the state of
<br>
being actively governed. I can purposely design a minarchist government
<br>
that will be significantly freer than your fascist government. Likewise,
<br>
I prefer to be a registered driver here in NH, which has no insurance
<br>
mandates for unconvicted drivers, no statewide auto insurance, and  thus
<br>
has far lower premium rates, accident, injury, and death rates, and far
<br>
lower taxes, thanks.
