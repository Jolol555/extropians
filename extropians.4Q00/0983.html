</em><br>
<p>Exactly. I definitely doesn't want to be the first upload but rather
<br>
part of the research team (a scary thought for all would-be-uploads :-)
<br>
<p>In reality, people opt for a technology when the benefits seem to
<br>
outweigh the cost (as well as various other technology adoption
<br>
factors); there is a group of innovators and early adopters who will
<br>
try things long before the others and be the real guinea pigs. Often
<br>
people adopt technology long before it is flawless, even when it is
<br>
dangerous (airbags, airplanes, operating systems). As a Stanislaw Lem
<br>
character remarked, we really ought to raise a monument to the honor
<br>
of all those who died while attempting to discover what was edible or
<br>
not - they helped us immensely. The same goes for the betatesters.
<br>
<p>Here is something to think about: how to make it profitable to be an
<br>
early adopter or beta tester? Society as a whole needs them, but they
<br>
do not seem to derive that much benefit themselves and I would expect
<br>
that memetic evolution would make them relatively scarce. We might
<br>
want to create institutions that help them to thrive and produce
<br>
experience.
