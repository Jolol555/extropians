<p>I hope that's not too completely facetious.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I have seen enough war movies.
<br>
<p>About history, well... I learned what they told me and what I have read and
<br>
what I have seen, but don't believe all of it, and recognize much is not
<br>
told.  I don't presume that situation comedies nor war novels are
<br>
historically accurate.
<br>
<p>It's heartwarming that what I have written has brightened your day, whether
<br>
or not it was at the expense of a casual context.
<br>
<p>Now then, about &quot;True Learning, and How to Get It&quot;, that is perhaps more
<br>
discutable, to not coin a phrase.
<br>
<p>True learning is about the ability to read the environment, and the ability
<br>
to communicate within it with others, and the motivation to know more.
<br>
<p>It's important to know oneself, to some extent, although that concept should
<br>
perhaps be avoided due to its &quot;New Age&quot; connotations.
<br>
<p>There is the entirety of all actions that have ever occurred, and no one
<br>
person knows except an infinitesimal part of it, unless they are
<br>
metaphysically a higher power.  By the same token, I know none who know
<br>
everything about anything, however small.  However, by the same token, there
<br>
are many discrete events that any with the sense can observe.  For example,
<br>
the sun in the sky burns.
<br>
<p>Reality appears to be quite consistent and continuous.  That's not to say
<br>
that strange things don't happen.
<br>
<p>So then, about learning, how do we learn to learn?
<br>
<p>Or, equivalently, how do we learn to learn to learn to learn...?
