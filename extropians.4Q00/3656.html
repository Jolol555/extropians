<p>&lt;&lt; If it has my thoughts and memories, it's I (2-6).  Which piece of 
<br>
&nbsp;meat or silicon is housing those thoughts and memories is no more of 
<br>
&nbsp;a question of &quot;Which is I?&quot; than if you evaluated me with and without 
<br>
&nbsp;a nose job, or with and without $1,000,000 in my bank account.
<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree. As the human bodies cells die and are replaced. The I of today 
<br>
is not the same as the I of yesterday. The I of today in theory does not 
<br>
posses a single cell from the I of 11 or 12 years ago. Even the entire 
<br>
skeleton has been replaced. Yet I am still me and I do not refer to the hairs 
<br>
on my brush or skinflakes on the floor as &quot;I&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me. &quot;I&quot; is all about where my conciousness resides. If I am copied, 
<br>
one of us will be me the other will just be a copy.  It only enters a grey 
<br>
area if my conscience is expanded into the copy and then split. I could 
<br>
emagine this like the feeling when you have slept on an arm, woken up with 
<br>
your arm paralysed and your conscience (be it only in feeling rather than 
<br>
thought) spreads out down your arm until it is a part of you. And then 
<br>
suddenly cut off. granted an arm is not capable of independent thought but is 
<br>
that arm still a part of &quot;I&quot; or is it just an &quot;it&quot;. To me It is an &quot;IT&quot; 
<br>
untill it is rejoined to my body. This goes for every other part of my body 
<br>
except obvoiusly the brain. Or maybe not. If I grew a new part of my brain to 
<br>
replace another part and then removed the other part keeping my brain 
<br>
function intact. The part removed would not be me or part of me, This goes 
<br>
for every other part of my brain. So &quot;I&quot; would purely be the contents of my 
<br>
brain, Memories, experience and the way I think, but all of these could be 
<br>
duplicated in an external body , but it would not be me. So what is Me ?. 
<br>
Just the conciousness itself ? If that were true then am I not me when I am 
<br>
unconcious. hmmm.. that doesn't seem to leave anything. OK so I don't exist.
