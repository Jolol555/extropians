<p><em> &gt; Wow that sounds exactly like something out of a dystopian sci-fi novel.

Unfortunately, that one is not a movie script, it's for real.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; I suppose you are not a believer in free will- these people once detected
</em><br>
<p>Free will? Huh? Relevance to the issue at hand?
<br>
<p><em> &gt; should be locked away by the government since they are absolutely guaranteed
</em><br>
<p>I don't care who does it, though I'm not a particular subscriber to
<br>
the efficiency of governments.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; to kill someone at some time (we just can't tell when darn it!). Or even if
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I wasn't referring to isolated homicides, regretful as they
<br>
might be.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; not, the extra sleep we will get at night is worth it right?
</em><br>
<p>I do appreciate the sarcasm, but are you really sure that the problem
<br>
of intelligent persons without compassion in command of Armageddon
<br>
technologies (nevermind the occasional rape or serial killing, they're
<br>
statistically irrelevant, unless you happen to be the afflicted parent
<br>
or spouse) is really insubstantial? On the long run?
<br>
<p>In blind faith, because you instinctively feel it to be unethical?
<br>
Without even warranting a further study, quantifying the problem?
<br>
Apart from those unfortunates locked up for victimless crimes, you
<br>
should take a closer look at the people populating U.S. prisons (~1%
<br>
of total populace now, is it?). You'll find some of the psychopaths
<br>
highly enrichened there (though probably still constituting a minority
<br>
even after abstracting victimless crime inmates), though largely
<br>
lacking the smart ones. Since these rarely get caught.
<br>
<p>Admittedly, I'm going out on a limb here, proposing existance of
<br>
something I can't easily prove in hard numbers. But you should talk to
<br>
some people in law enforcement. And there are some papers out there,
<br>
anecdotal though they are.
<br>
<p>(Of course, all this is only of tangential relevance of the AI golem
<br>
thing. Despite me being nice enough to volunteer enough rope to knot a
<br>
dozen nooses. Double nyahnyah).
