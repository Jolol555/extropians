<em>&gt; &gt; maybe we should add love there too :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good idea! Add love to AI:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI + L = AIL
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, well. A sick machine intelligence might evolve to a weak Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps if Stalin had been more lovesick, he wouldn't have caused the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murder of thirty million of his people. Then again, maybe he *was*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lovesick and that's what motivated his murderous attitude.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps you're defining love the wrong way.  Is obsessive, lovesick, longing
<br>
truly love?
<br>
<p>Love is best defined as a strong attraction between two entities for the
<br>
purpose of creation- creation of what is defined by the nature of the
<br>
entities.  Although we tend to limit the definition of love to friendships,
<br>
erotically attached couples, family relations, and theological concerns,
<br>
these are merely human expressions of the force we call love- on an
<br>
interpersonal and cosmic scale.  An atom, a bacterium, and a transhuman AI
<br>
all express love in their own way- below or beyond our comprehension.
<br>
<p>-Nicq MacDonald
<br>
<p>&quot;We do progress, but how?  Not by the tinkering of the meliorist; not by the
<br>
crushing of initiative; not by laws and regulations which hamstring the
<br>
racehorse, and handcuff the boxer; but by the innovations of the eccentric,
<br>
by the phantasies of the hashish-dreamer of philosophy, by the aspirations
<br>
of the idealist to the impossible, by the imagination of the revolutionary,
<br>
by the perilous adventure of the pioneer.  Progress is by leaps and bounds,
<br>
by breaking from custom, by working on untried experiments; in short, by the
<br>
follies and crimes of men of genius, only recognizable as wisdom and virtue
<br>
after they have been tortured to death, and their murderers reap gloatingly
<br>
the harvest of the seeds they sowed at midnight.&quot; -Aleister Crowley, &quot;On
<br>
