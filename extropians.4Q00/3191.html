<em>&gt;  &gt; Is missing the &quot;point&quot; the same as not buying into a fallacious argument?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No.  It is fully possible to understand an article, and rationally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disagree with it.  This is much different than misunderstanding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;article, and disagreeing with an interpretation of the article that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not, in fact, valid.  (Indeed, this latter is one form of a cause of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much anger in the world.)
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, maybe a smiley after my question would have made it clearer 
<br>
that it was sarcasm.  I well understood what you were implying by 
<br>
saying I had &quot;missed the point&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; Do you feel that Mr. Brin's argument was sound, or is your support
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  more of a vague approval of his general theme?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I believe his argument was sound given his premeses.
</em><br>
<p>I don't.  As I mentioned, the argument that he attempted to build 
<br>
along the way was so hopelessly flawed that I was forced to view his 
<br>
conclusions as unsupported.
<br>
<p>At the bottom of this response, I've taken his essay and pointed out 
<br>
just a few of the fallacies therein.  It's far from an exhaustive 
<br>
attack of his logic, but enough to call the reasoning of his 
<br>
conclusions into serious question.
<br>
<p>As a professional writer and a scientist, couldn't he have done better?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I also see some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;merit in the idea of corrupting, as it were, the current government to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more libertarian ideas (as he puts it, &quot;evolution&quot; rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;revolution&quot;) instead of devoting all resources to making government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;irrelevant.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  That's not a bad idea.  He has some other ideas that I'd agree 
<br>
to in the article as well, like taking an innovative new approach to 
<br>
education.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, these are just small ideas thrown out in a larger 
<br>
article, which was rendered as an argument.
<br>
<p>He also made the statement that he votes for Democrats - at the very 
<br>
beginning of his essay.  I'm not saying that voting for Democrats is 
<br>
necessarily wrong.  I'm just saying that the Democratic and 
<br>
Libertarian parties are on quite different sides of the political 
<br>
spectrum.  For a general audience, the burden would be upon Mr. Brin 
<br>
to explain in a consistent manner how voting for a party with a 
<br>
noticeably opposed ideology would achieve the goals of Libertarians.
<br>
<p>He didn't do that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; As it is, his argument is overly loaded with fallacies.  Am I wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; to then not just accept his conclusions as valid?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The conclusions you objected to were not the conclusions of the article.
</em><br>
<p>I was objecting to his arguments, not necessarily his conclusions. 
<br>
If an argument is fallacious, it doesn't mean that the conclusions 
<br>
are wrong, just that they're unsupported by that particular argument.
<br>
<p>I think that you and I might disagree about the details of his 
<br>
conclusions, but the fact that there is such a lack of clarity in his 
<br>
essay seems to be more the fault of the author than his audience.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; He claims to be mostly a Libertarian, but he actually votes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for Democrats.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;Yep.  Because he believes that Libertarian aims can be more effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;achieved by improving the system - which requires working within it, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;thus working with The Powers That Be - than the current ideal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;destroying the system and starting over (which is presumably what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;L candidates he voted against were promoting).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  He never explicitly mentioned voting &quot;against&quot; Libertarians.  He said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  that he voted &quot;for&quot; Democrats.  Whether that means that he wanted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  vote for possible winners in a major party or he wanted to vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  against a revolutionary LP candidate is unknowable from this piece -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I find support for both positions.  They both seem equally likely so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  taking one side or the other would be special pleading.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Technically, under most of the American political system (which, to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge, is what Mr. Brin votes in), a vote for one candidate for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;position (where only one person may fill that position) is a vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against all others.  (I personally would not mind seeing that change,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but that is the reality for now.)
</em><br>
<p>Above, you characterized Mr. Brin's voting for Democrats as being a 
<br>
direct vote *against* the LP candidate.  Implying his intent from his 
<br>
arguments is not discernable.  Yes, we all know that the American 
<br>
voting system is basically a zero sum game.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; &gt;Summary: passing and changing laws and instituations to promote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;individuality, rather than merely repealing/removing most or all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;existing laws and institutions, is an approach that the public is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;likely to vote into office.  It is also more likely to bring better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;results in practice, even if either one were equally able to gain power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  To be clear:  Are you also espousing this &quot;Libertarian goals through
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the Democratic party&quot; philosophy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, *he* is.  (And it's not through the Democratic party per se; it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through existing government - including both Republicrat parties.)  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just trying to clarify his argument.  While I can see merit in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;idea, I have not given it nearly as much thought as he has, so I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probably not nearly as comfortable with it as he is.
</em><br>
<p>If we're supplementing his argument with speculation, he might have 
<br>
meant that we can achieve Libertarian goals by also co-opting the 
<br>
Green party.  Speculation aside, he said that he votes in general 
<br>
elections for Democrats.  How he goes from voting consistently for 
<br>
Democrats to achieving Libertarian goals is beyond me.
<br>
<p>If he had said:
<br>
<p>Whether Republican, Democrat, or independent - vote for the candidate 
<br>
who both has a chance to win and espouses (and you believe will stick 
<br>
to) the following goals:
<br>
<p>1. Across the board reduction of taxes
<br>
2. Reduction of military expenditures for nation-building exercies
<br>
3. Increase of individual rights for drug use, euthanasia, sexual 
<br>
interaction, etc.
<br>
4. Promotes strict responsibility for and enforcement of property laws
<br>
5. ...
<br>
<p>... I might have agreed with his conclusions (although his arguments 
<br>
would still have been fallacious and in need of work).
<br>
<p>However, he didn't really say any of that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; If so, could you explain a little more in detail about how promoting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the political party that believes in bigger government, higher income
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  taxes, a de-emphasis on personal property, less personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  responsibility, and severe gun control will obtain the benefits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the party that believes in minimal government, no income taxes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  stronger property rights, higher individual responsibility, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  protected gun rights?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I believe his reply to this would be to change the parties' beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For instance, getting libertarian (or even Libertarian) candidates to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;challenge current Democrat or Republican candidates for their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parties' nominations, rather than running as independent candidates or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;working to take down the system entirely.  Now, how to do this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;successfully without becoming corrupted by or beholden to Republicrat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interests is another issue, but he seemed to believe that this would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the easier path...
</em><br>
<p>See, I might agree with that conclusion of yours, and the question 
<br>
that you raise is a much more pertinent one than any in his essay.
<br>
<p>Mr. Brin, however, made no logical effort to put forth that idea.  As 
<br>
I mentioned before, certainly a professional writer could have made 
<br>
that point if it had been the one that he was working toward.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
<br>
<p><p><p>------------------------------------------------------
<br>
Below are portions of Mr. Brin's essay with my comments indicating 
<br>
fallacious arguments.
<br>
------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;After serious thought, I can only conclude that I must be a... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(shudder)... pragmatist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No word is better guaranteed to offend those who love the memic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pleasures of ideology. According to the deeply-rooted tradition of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Plato, the world is made up of essences. Some may be right and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;others wrong, but any person worthy of respect must believe in some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;essential &quot;truth&quot;, some law or model of human nature, whether it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the labor theory of value or an absolute right of property.  Men of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the True Right and True Left often respect each other on principle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;while disagreeing. Above all, they share contempt for wishy-washy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;types who see partial truths coming from all directions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yep, those pure Platonic ideologies offer loads of satisfaction. But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sorry, I can't join in.  I can't afford the luxury.  I have too many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;urgent needs for the present and goals for tomorrow.  I want those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;needs satisfied and those goals fulfilled, but the last century has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proved again and again that ideologies aren't especially helpful at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;achieving practical goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Moreover, recent advances in anthropology, neuroscience and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complexity theory all converge toward one conclusion; even the most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compelling or beguiling ideological description can never encompass 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the range of emergent and often contradictory qualities contained in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a single human being, let alone whole societies.
</em><br>
<p>Straw man: Political ideologies aren't about encompassing all of the 
<br>
qualities in a human being.  They're more about the goals of the 
<br>
society and how to go about achieving those goals - so learning that 
<br>
Libertarian principles don't have all mutations of Human DNA in them 
<br>
does nothing to diminish the validity of their political ideas.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;What do I need right now?   Because I'm a brash eccentric, I need a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society that is open, tolerant, even welcoming of eccentricity. One 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whose institutions are accountable enough to minimize the inevitable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capricious power abuses that fester in every human culture.  One 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where competition takes place under conditions that maximize fair 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comparison of quality (in goods, services, and ideas) while 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minimizing the destructive effects of our most loathsome human trait 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- our talent for rationalizing cheating and oppression.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What do I want for tomorrow?  A world where coercion is minimized 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and individuals are free to achieve the maximum they can by making 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fair deals with each other, leveraging off others' talents and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;benefiting from the mutual criticism that only true freedom 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;engenders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now I concede -- heck, I avow! -- that these desiderata sound 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;awfully libertarian.  But let's recall that, ironically, the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;futurist dream was shared by idealizing Marxists!
</em><br>
<p>I'm no expert on Marxism, but did the Marxists believe in trading for 
<br>
things or leveraging talents for any sort of personal gain?  If 
<br>
someone needed something, you gave it to them if you could: From each 
<br>
his ability, to each his need.  Melding Marxism and Libertarianism 
<br>
seems disingenuous at best.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   They, too, envisioned a final destination without states or any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;coercive institutions, only human beings interacting autonomously. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The chief difference was always over the right path to achieve that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;envisioned paradise of emancipated individuals.  Marxists fantasized 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that it would emerge semi-violently from some &quot;final stage of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;industrial capitalization&quot; -- as if that ongoing task could ever be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;finished!  Libertarians, on the other hand, see the ultimate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apotheosis of individualism coming as a result of...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, here's where we have a problem, because there are some real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contradictions that I seldom hear my libertarian friends talk about. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Especially over the basic difference between evolution and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;revolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Revolution is far more gut-satisfying and romantic, but in order to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;justify it, you must assume the worst. To hear some true-believers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rail against today's society, you'd think we live in a wretched 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Orwellian dictatorship filled with bovine Democrats, porcine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Republicans, and sheeplike voters, all of them too stupid to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perceive the Truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I admit that I'm drawn to these characters, because of their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;admirable passion.  I find much that's appealing about their ardent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dream of a better world.  Alas, their stern righteousness makes them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;irresistible targets for playful teasing.  For instance, I find that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing causes these delightfully articulate firebrands to go 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tongue-locked more efficiently than asking the following question. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Can you name one human civilization, past or present, that was even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;half as close to what you desire as contemporary America is today?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Like their spiritual cousins -- radical feminists -- these fellows 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enjoy the indignant rush of knowing they are right.  And like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;radical feminists, they find it galling to be reminded how far 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedom has already come. Or how this culture seems almost designed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to bring them about. Or that their citizenship may have real value 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in a civilization that -- while still flawed -- is nevertheless more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hope-filled and worthy of the name than any other.  A civilization 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that seems already to be moving in the direction they desire.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;and see my &quot;questionnaire on ideology&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I encourage you to follow the above links and look at the questions. 
<br>
They're so loaded and riddled with false dichotomies that they seem - 
<br>
to me - to be farcical.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Does the commonly held libertarian self-image - as a doctrine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arising solely from evidence and reason -- really hold?  The answer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may embarrass you.
</em><br>
<p>Ad Hominem.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;For example, do you want to talk about propaganda? I'll show you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;propaganda! Modern western media messages -- e.g. in nearly every 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hollywood movie -- emphasize in-your-face individualism and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suspicion of authority, pounding these themes more relentlessly than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any other motif in human history.  Never before has an idea been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;given such play!  So might our libertarian attitudes actually arise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from this everpresent indoctrination?  From lessons we've imbibed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;since childhood, suckling them from the teat of a society that is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much less conformist and more cherishing of individualism than we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;let ourselves imagine?
</em><br>
<p>Here's a cause and effect problem.  The &quot;in-your-face individualism&quot; 
<br>
expressed in movies could be (and is most likely, IMO) a reflection 
<br>
of pre-existing human desires, not the cultivation of them.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When I mention this in public, some audience members greet the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apparent paradox with displeasure, even anger.  It's discomfiting to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imagine that a proudly singular trait might have arisen from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relentless propaganda!  How much more satisfying to say to yourself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- &quot;I invented individualism and rebellion!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Fallacious a priori.  He's proven no paradox.
<br>
<p>[ Snipped his conclusions that now have no sound arguments upon which 
<br>
to stand. ]
