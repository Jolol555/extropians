See also the RS-20 (aka SS-18 'Satan', to Nato/Jane's) Dnepr project.
<br>
Russia is always looking for things to trade for hard currency, and
<br>
they've done at least one orbit of about 320 kg with this booster.
<br>
Launching them turns out to be cheaper than destroying them some other
<br>
ways, or so I'm told. One of the tough things is leasing &quot;thumpdown&quot;
<br>
rights for the first stage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oooops, I guess I coulda read your whole post before starting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; babble.  Minuteman you say?  Thats a whole nuther story.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jeff, Im beginning to see where you are going, and no, I dont think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is gonna be huuuge savings in using decommissioned military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware for space access.  Doug might jump in here, but I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the war stuff is too highly specialized for high reliability and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design goals to be very good at heavy lift.  The armed forces might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use some of their own decommissioned missiles for payload lift,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I doubt they will sell it at bargain prices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What do they do with these things, anyway, when they decommission them as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; part of whatever arms control/disarmament agreement requires it?  Anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know FOR SURE?  Destroy them, would be my guess.  But perhaps they're just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no good for &quot;peaceful&quot; purposes.  Doug, spike?  Anyone?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ja, they destroy them in a very public way.  They serve their purpose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating tears of joy in the hearts of peaceloving people everywhere,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including me.  I cant tell you how pleased I am that these death machines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were never used, and good chance now they never will be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Recall the first manned space boosters were converted military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A few of the motors are used for ground test purposes, and of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course they have flight tests often.  The FBM system has had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 89 consecutive flawless firings, last I heard, and some of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware is getting up there in years now.  Shows to go ya, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff was designed right to start with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I won't embellish my question any further because you can see where I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; going.  I mean it isn't exactly rocket sci...well, er,... I guess,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actually, it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jeff keep an eye out for that guy from Kennewick Washington.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He is using Commie boosters with a recoverable first stage, from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sea.  Sounds to me like the front runner for doing what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you describe: low cost access to space.  Kistler Engineering I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think its called, and Doug, this would be a great place to plug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your company.  spike
