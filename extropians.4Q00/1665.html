<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
<p>Melatonin restores potency in male rats
<br>
<p>In a study reported in a recent issue of the journal Brain Research, male
<br>
rats who demonstrated a disinterest in sexual activity or inability to
<br>
ejaculate were injected with melatonin and found to exhibit an increase in
<br>
sexual events and their completion. Researchers from the University of
<br>
Catania Medical School in Catania, Italy selected male rats that
<br>
demonstrated no interest in sex, or what the researchers categorized as
<br>
null sexual approach, and those whose sexual activity did not proceed to
<br>
ejaculation, a category termed &quot;sexually sluggish&quot;. The rats received
<br>
doses of 10, 50 or 100 micrograms melatonin per kilogram body by
<br>
injection. Rats in the null sexual approach group exhibited mounting as
<br>
well as ejaculation, while those in the &quot;sluggish&quot; group were able to
<br>
complete their activities. The response of the rats was dose dependent.
<br>
Melatonin's ability to promote ejaculation was confirmed in some rats by
<br>
the injection of the hormone with a melatonin receptor antagonist, which
<br>
by blocking melatonin prevented an exhibition of full potency in the rats.
<br>
<p>The authors note that chronic doses of melatonin, rather than acute doses
<br>
such as those administered by injection in the experiment, are known to
<br>
inhibit male sexual activity. Longterm treatment of melatonin may mimic a
<br>
persistent peak of the hormone, which inhibits reproductive activity in
<br>
rats, whereas a surge of the hormone appears to stimulate male sexual
<br>
behavior. Higher doses of the hormone have an inhibitory effect as well.
<br>
<p>In the study's discussion, the authors point out that &quot;This is the first
<br>
evidence that a naturally occurring substance may restore the full pattern
<br>
of sexual activity in impotent male animals. If these findings can be
<br>
confirmed in men, they could be of clinical importance in psychic
<br>
impotence situations.&quot;
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Testosterone helps relieve angina
<br>
<p>It has been widely believed that androgenic hormones such as testosterone
<br>
are a contributor to heart disease due to the far greater number of men
<br>
than women afflicted with the disease, and the fact that sudden cardiac
<br>
death has been observed in some people taking high doses of anabolic
<br>
steroids. However, it has recently been observed that androgenic hormones
<br>
such as testosterone may benefit the heart, and it is interesting to note
<br>
that cardiovascular disease usually appears later in a man's life, when
<br>
testosterone levels are low.
<br>
<p>In a study published in the October 17 2000 issue of Circulation, Journal
<br>
of the American Heart Association, forty-six men with stable angina
<br>
received two 2.5 mg transdermal testosterone patchs to be applied nightly
<br>
for two weeks, and were then randomized into a group receiving either the
<br>
testosterone patches or a placebo for twelve weeks. The men were tested on
<br>
a treadmill for their angina threshold via electrocardiogram findings that
<br>
would indicate the onset of angina at the beginning of the study and at
<br>
two, six, ten and fourteen weeks. Blood pressure, pulse, body mass index
<br>
and serum testosterone were also calculated, as were other blood values.
<br>
<p>At the study's onset, androgen levels were at the lower limit of the
<br>
normal range for both the testosterone and the placebo group. After
<br>
treatment with testosterone, those receiving the hormone had an increase
<br>
in androgens without changes in other parameters. However, the amount of
<br>
time that it took the men on testosterone to demonstrate the onset of
<br>
angina when tested on a treadmill was significantly longer compared to the
<br>
placebo group, and the men receiving the hormone reported less pain and
<br>
less limitation from physical problems.
<br>
The authors note that the size of the study was small, and recommend large
<br>
scale clinical trials to further study the effects of androgen replacement
<br>
therapy in men.

<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Male hormone modulation
<br>
<p>In writing this protocol, the Life Extension Foundation reviewed several
<br>
thousand published scientific studies to validate safety and anti-aging
<br>
efficacy. We also received input from experts who have personally followed
<br>
this system for several years.  Implementing this protocol requires
<br>
diligent medical testing, but the potential for significant age reversal
<br>
is compelling.
<br>
<p>As men age past year 40, hormonal changes occur that perceptibly inhibit
<br>
physical, sexual, and cognitive function. The outward appearance of a
<br>
typical middle aged male shows increased abdominal fat and shrinkage of
<br>
muscle mass, a hallmark effect of hormone imbalance. A loss of feeling of
<br>
well being, sometimes manifesting as depression, is a common psychological
<br>
complication of hormone imbalance.
<br>
<p>A male hormone imbalance can be detected through use of the proper blood
<br>
tests and can be corrected using available drugs and nutrients.   If
<br>
estradiol levels are high (above 30), total testosterone is mid- to
<br>
high-normal and free testosterone levels are low or low-normal (at the
<br>
bottom one-third of the highest number on the reference range), you should
<br>
make sure you are getting 80 to 90 mg a day of zinc. (Zinc functions as an
<br>
aromatase inhibitor for some men.)
<br>
<p>If free testosterone levels are in the lower two-thirds of the highest
<br>
number in the reference range, but total testosterone is high-normal, and
<br>
estradiol levels are not over 30, you should take 320 mg a day of the
<br>
super-critical extract of saw palmetto and 240 mg a day of the methanolic
<br>
extract of nettle (Urtica dioica).

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>OptiZinc
<br>
<p>Zinc is a mineral necessary for the formation of superoxide dismutase, one
<br>
of the body's free radical scavengers. It also promotes wound healing,
<br>
immune function, taste sensitivity, is necessary for protein synthesis,
<br>
assists in the formation of insulin and is important for the development
<br>
of all reproductive organs. OptiZinctm is the most bioavailable form of
<br>
zinc.

<br>
<p><p>Super Saw Palmetto/Nettle Root Formula
<br>
<p>Published scientific literature, along with ten years of experience at the
<br>
Life Extension Foundation, shows that saw palmetto extract by itself is
<br>
effective in alleviating symptoms of benign prosate disease in most men.
<br>
However, newly published studies reveal evidence that men over age fifty
<br>
should add nettle root extract to the new saw palmetto extract for
<br>
prevention purposes. As men age, their ratio of estrogen to testosterone
<br>
increases, thus making it important to inhibit the effects of estrogens,
<br>
sex hormone binding globulin and dihydrotestosterone. While saw palmetto
<br>
protects against prostate enlargement caused by dihydrotestosterone,
<br>
nettle root is required to inhibit the proliferation of prostate cells in
<br>
response to estrogen and sex hormone binding globulin. Since we now have a
<br>
molecular understanding of how nettle functions in the body, it would
<br>
appear that most men could both prevent and effectively treat benign
<br>
prostate hyperplasia by taking Super Saw Palmetto/Nettle Root. Super Saw
<br>
Palmetto/Nettle Root contains a new methanolic nettle root extract which
<br>
is more effective than the ethanolic extract.

<p>BOOK
<br>
The Testosterone Syndrome
<br>
<p>The andropause years are certainly not considered the best by any man.
<br>
While not as severe as menopause, the male version is lengthier - it
<br>
usually lasts 15 to 20 years. And it does take quite a toll on strength,
<br>
energy, vigor and sexual function.
<br>
<p>The Testosterone Syndrome, authored by Dr. Eugene Shippen, M.D. and
<br>
William Fryer, provides a persuasive argument in favor of hormone
<br>
modulation in the aged male. Based on many interesting case histories, the
<br>
book shows that high levels of testosterone are directly related to higher
<br>
levels of mental and physical function. And it tells you how to use
<br>
natural testosterone to your advantage. Required reading, The Testosterone
<br>
Syndrome goes beyond helping you cope. It helps you LIVE.
