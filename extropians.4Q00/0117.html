<em>&gt; Looking over Eugene's posts, I begin to become confused.  As far as I can

<em>&gt; nanotechnology, and uploading will all inevitably end in disaster.  I could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong about Eugene's opinion on uploading, but as I recall Eugene said to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>While I don't speak for Eugene, I think I understand what his primary
<br>
concern is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From most of what I have seen thrown about, most singularity/AI
</em><br>
development plans appear to have extremely half-assed deployment schemes,
<br>
to the point of being grossly negligent.  Most of the researchers seem
<br>
largely concerned with development rather than working on the problems of
<br>
deployment.  The pervasive &quot;we'll just flip the switch and the universe
<br>
will change as we know it&quot; attitude is unnecessarily careless and arguably
<br>
not even a necessary outcome of such research, but if the attitude persists
<br>
all sorts of untold damage may happen as a result.  As with all
<br>
potentially nasty new technologies, you have to run it like a military
<br>
operation, having a vast number of contingency plans at your disposal in
<br>
case things do go wrong.
<br>
<p>I personally believe that a controlled and reasonably safe deployment
<br>
scheme is possible, and certainly preferable.  And contrary to what some
<br>
people will argue, I have not seen an argument that has convinced me that
<br>
controlled growth of the AI is not feasible; it has to obey the same laws
<br>
of physics and mathematics as everyone else.  If our contingency
<br>
technologies are not adequate at the time AI is created, put hard resource
<br>
constraints on the AI until contingencies are in place.  A constrained AI
<br>
is still extraordinarly useful, even if operating at below its potential. 
<br>
The very fact that a demonstrable AI technology exists (coupled with the
<br>
early technology development capabilities of said AI) should allow one to
<br>
directly access and/or leverage enough financial resources to start
<br>
working on a comprehensive program of getting people off of our orbiting
<br>
rock and hopefully outside of our local neighborhood.  I would prefer to
<br>
be observing from a very safe distance before unleashing an unconstrained
<br>
AI upon the planet.
