&quot;Green-bashing&quot; seems to have become something of a sport on the list lately 
<br>
(and one in which I engage on a regular basis).  But I think it's important 
<br>
to reiterate that extropianism is NOT a &quot;develop-to-death&quot; value system.  In 
<br>
fact, I'm an avid and active conservationist (I won't use the word 
<br>
&quot;environmentalist&quot; to describe myself any more, for the same reason I've 
<br>
reluctantly abandoned &quot;liberal&quot; in favor of &quot;libertarian&quot; -- the word has 
<br>
been co-opted by a political movement with which I take deep exception.)  In 
<br>
fact, I concluded early on that the extropian principles are thoroughly 
<br>
consistent with a vigorous conservation of wilderness.  Five years ago I 
<br>
posted the following to the list:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- - - - - - -
<br>
<p>Toward an extropian environmentalist ethic. The ideas and values expressed 
<br>
within the extropian community are vigorously individualistic, find the 
<br>
workings of the freest possible market systems as the best current 
<br>
environment for incubating a positive future for humanity and challenge the 
<br>
sacred cows of the fundamentalist &quot;environmental movement.&quot; But the core of 
<br>
extropian ideas also values compassion, generosity and a reverence for the 
<br>
beauty and power of the natural living environment of the earth. This last 
<br>
set of values is less well understood outside the extropian community and 
<br>
there is apparently a common caricature of extropians as &quot;selfish, greedy 
<br>
despoilers of the environment&quot;. 
<br>
<p>By and large, extropians find that an &quot;absolutist&quot; evaluation of &quot;nature&quot; is 
<br>
as evil as is a thoughtless destruction of the beauty that nature offers. The 
<br>
hard questions come in deriving the right balance. 
<br>
<p>No &quot;bright line&quot; can or should be drawn between &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;man&quot;. Humans, 
<br>
their technology and their effect on their environment are &quot;natural&quot; because 
<br>
consciousness and its products developed as part of the spontaneous order of 
<br>
the terran biosphere. Thus the concept of a &quot;natural&quot; environment distinct 
<br>
from humanity (or posthumanity), per se, is untenable. Furthermore, such a 
<br>
concept of nature distinct from humanity is not helpful because, unless we 
<br>
advocate human genocide, it is hopelessly vague and confused. But this 
<br>
realization does not justify any human action. 
<br>
<p>For now, at least, Earth is the only planet of which we are aware that has 
<br>
spontaneously generated a rich biosphere. This phenomenon is scarce. Raw 
<br>
materials for an industrial society that can be found elsewhere than on/in 
<br>
this planet, on the other hand, are not. Earth constitutes a tiny fraction of 
<br>
the mass of the solar system. Even with the primitive survey of the solar 
<br>
system we have already made, we know we can find and exploit elsewhere the 
<br>
resources that an expanding industrial civilization needs. 
<br>
<p>Extropian environmentalism places a high value on the living wilderness 
<br>
simply because it is rare and options exist and more will exist for the 
<br>
continued technological development of consciousness other than consuming 
<br>
those living wilderness zones. This does not place an unreasonably absolute 
<br>
value on living wilderness, but simply makes preserving it as much as 
<br>
possible one value among many, albeit a great value. Preserving living terran 
<br>
wilderness zones is consistent with the value of spontaneous order simply 
<br>
because life on this planet is, so far, the most complex example of this 
<br>
phenomenon of which we are aware. If for no other reason, mere curiosity 
<br>
about spontaneous order should lead us to interact with at least some of 
<br>
these zones as little as possible, at least until we better understand the 
<br>
processes that gave rise to them and by which they continue to operate. 
<br>
<p>Post-human beings will have the power to allow the planet that was their 
<br>
cradle to continue to harbor biological life at least similar to that which 
<br>
originally gave rise to them. We don't tear down the Louvre to build 
<br>
apartment blocks, we build housing elsewhere. No one is significantly poorer 
<br>
because of it and at least some people are much richer because of it. Thus, 
<br>
along with buying wilderness zones for their value as such, a privatist 
<br>
environmental ethic also looks to develop technological alternatives to 
<br>
consuming these areas, as much as possible, so that the relative market value 
<br>
of other options will spontaneously support maximal preservation of living 
<br>
wilderness. This is not an absolutist ethic of &quot;sustainable development&quot;, but 
<br>
rather simply the economic value free people put on technological and 
<br>
economic developmental pathways that impact the terran biosphere less rather 
<br>
than more.
