<em>&gt;To that end (and for the sake of brevity,) I invite you to engage the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Does the initial discrete reality experiencer transition into a new

</em><br>
<p><p>I guess the answer to that question mainly hinges on the definition 
<br>
of &quot;initial discrete reality experiencer&quot;, and possibly on 
<br>
&quot;transition&quot; - I'll ask about that below.
<br>
<p>What makes you you?
<br>
<p>Besides the physical characteristics that I think that we can all 
<br>
agree upon are copied down to the smallest detail, the mental 
<br>
characteristics define who we are.
<br>
<p>Basically, my &quot;mental characteristics&quot; are comprised of the memories 
<br>
I have and the neural algorithms that drive my thoughts, as well as 
<br>
any capacity to support those algorithms.
<br>
<p>Copy the mental and physical &quot;me&quot; exactly, and there's no real 
<br>
distinction between the two.  If the existence of the original ends 
<br>
in the copying process, there is no real loss, and effectively the 
<br>
initial discrete reality experiencer is transitioned into a new 
<br>
substrate.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure why you used the word &quot;transition&quot; in your question.  Do 
<br>
you mean &quot;is copied exactly&quot;?  Or are you asking about some 
<br>
metaphysical transference?
<br>
<p>If it's the former, then I'd answer &quot;yes&quot; to your question.
<br>
<p>As a side note:
<br>
<p>Consider the classic notion of teleportation, as described in the 
<br>
Star Trek series and in &quot;The Fly&quot;:  You're broken down atom by atom, 
<br>
turned into energy, then reconstructed at the other end.  That being 
<br>
at the other end of the teleportation process is effectively a copy 
<br>
as described in this thread, wouldn't you agree?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
