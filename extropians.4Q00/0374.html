<p><em> &gt; My current diet is below average -- below 2K calories per diem -- but above

<p>If you work out additionally, you can move into the CR regime (which
<br>
is a continuum, anyway. Obesity reduces your lifespan, so going away
<br>
from that while staying above Dachau diet can only do good).
<br>
<p>I also sure hope they manage to make the CR pill within the next few
<br>
years. (Now here's something with the potential to outsell sildenafil
<br>
times propecia).
