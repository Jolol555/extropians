&lt;&lt;WRONG.  She saw pity as a sad and not very desirable emotion that it
<br>
would be better not to have cause to feel.  But she did not see it as
<br>
weakness or dysfunction or character flaw.   It is not desirable to
<br>
experience pity.  It is more desriable to be able to do something
<br>
positive to improve that which has illicited pity.  Pity by itself, or
<br>
any particular emotion, is not a good guide to decision and action in
<br>
objectivist thought.&gt;&gt;
<br>
The funny thing I see about this view of Pity is that it appears 
<br>
non-scientific. That is, are the any double-blind, psychological studies to 
<br>
support this notion that pity is better not experiened? I am being a hard-ass 
<br>
on this one, but no less then I feel this discussion merits, because of its 
<br>
social outcome.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Someone once said something like &quot;Pain is the whip of God&quot; - meaning
<br>
that pain is the impetus to find something better, to movement. &gt;&gt; Probably 
<br>
Torquemada ;-)
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;For it is a Work in the
<br>
most time-honored sense, a work of rebuilding self and world and of
<br>
transcending all limitation possible of being transcended.  Science by
<br>
itself will not give you and sustain the sense of mission that is needed
<br>
or the sacred dream meme that will join enough people together to make a
<br>
difference.

No disagreement here. But people who are pitiless, frequently contribute 
<br>
nothing to the commanality of the human experience. That state is also 
<br>
non-scientific, but it sure is experiential. My experiences anyway.
