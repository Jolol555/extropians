If you cannot find a school with a good nanotech program, or can't get a 
<br>
school to accept it as a special major, then drop out and just do it 
<br>
yourself. Or, major in business or something, to pay the bills, and to 
<br>
finance your studies. I did a cursosry search, looking to see if you could 
<br>
find used AFMs or STMs online for reasonable prices. Although I didn't find 
<br>
any on ebay, there are at least three sites which sell both AFMs and STMs:
<br>
<a href="http://www.molec.com/products/index.html">http://www.molec.com/products/index.html</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.di.com/">http://www.di.com/</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.asmicro.com/">http://www.asmicro.com/</a>
<br>
I didn't look too closely, but the only one I could find prices on was the 
<br>
third site. If you call some universities, do in-depth searches, newsgroup 
<br>
postings, you can probably find some nice used equiptment.
<br>
<p>Also, you could build an STM yourself:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/sn_arc98/10_24_98/Bob2.htm">http://www.sciencenews.org/sn_arc98/10_24_98/Bob2.htm</a> (scroll to the bottom 
<br>
of the page)
<br>
<p>Atom-viewing 101: Make STMs at home
<br>
<p>For all the sophisticated science that scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs) 
<br>
have spawned, they require surprisingly little technological sophistication 
<br>
to build.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's very simple technology,&quot; says Phillip E. Russell, a scientist at North 
<br>
Carolina State University in Raleigh who runs the school's 
<br>
scanning-probe-microscopy program. &quot;In my short course, I tell you how to do 
<br>
it with Radio Shack parts.&quot; The absence of lenses makes STMs relatively 
<br>
simple. Moreover, remarkably sensitive but widely available piezoelectric 
<br>
elements—common parts of doorbell buzzers and charcoal spark lighters—can 
<br>
give subnanometer control of motion.
<br>
<p>High school and even middle school students and their teachers seem to grasp 
<br>
the microscope's concepts, and &quot;they are not afraid of it,&quot; says Russell.
<br>
<p>One brave builder was in high school when he cobbled together in his bedroom 
<br>
an STM out of Legos and bungee cords. Adam Ezra Cohen of New York built the 
<br>
device for a pittance—about $50, he estimates—and with no 
<br>
microscope-building experience.
<br>
<p>Make no mistake. Cohen, now 19, is not your run-of-the-mill home tinkerer. 
<br>
Before graduating high school, he had already compiled a file of more than 
<br>
140 invention ideas, invented an electrochemical data-storage device and an 
<br>
eye tracker used in neurology research, and won the $40,000 first-place 
<br>
scholarship in the 1997 Science Talent Search (SN: 3/15/97, p. 159). He won 
<br>
the grand prize for both building the STM and devising a way to use it as an 
<br>
&quot;electrochemical paintbrush&quot; that deposits tiny lines of metal on surfaces.
<br>
<p>Yet, looking back, Cohen comments that &quot;I don't think this project is too 
<br>
tough for anybody.&quot; The key is being willing to devote a lot of time to the 
<br>
task, he says. He worked an hour or two a day for 8 months to build his STM.
<br>
<p>Other high schoolers have tackled STM projects, but usually as teams. At the 
<br>
Peddie School in Hightstown, N.J., for instance, a dozen seniors worked 
<br>
through the 1997­1998 school year with their physics teacher Nicholas R. 
<br>
Guilbert to design and build an STM. This spring, however, they donned their 
<br>
caps and gowns without having seen a single atom. Despite the disappointment 
<br>
of not finishing, &quot;we learned an awful lot,&quot; Guilbert says. &quot;The whole idea 
<br>
of tunneling gets into the quantum world, which for high school students is 
<br>
a real mystery.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The almost revolutionary part of this,&quot; Russell says, is that &quot;it has 
<br>
opened up imaging and measuring on a small scale to everyone.&quot; —P.W.
