<p>I don't wish to get into a Politics 101 argument (which I'd surely lose),
<br>
but that's certainly not how soi disant democratic politics works where I
<br>
live. 
<br>
<p>Leaving aside that the majority actually get what they've mostly been led
<br>
by the nose to agree to, from a stunningly limited menu of options, you
<br>
usually find that representations by parliamentarians from the non-ruling
<br>
party still have some effect; that there are all kinds of effective levels
<br>
of feedback and consultation; that the press, despite being muzzled by its
<br>
immensely rich owners, does play some kind of role in allowing a diversity
<br>
of voices to be heard, etc. 
<br>
<p>So let's say that the majority gets what it wants--but in times of
<br>
reasonable prosperity and comparative security, what the majority appears
<br>
to want (in Oz at least) is a `fair go' for everyone, according to their
<br>
lights, as long as their lights don't involve egregiously punching out the
<br>
lights of their neighbors.
