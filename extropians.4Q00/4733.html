<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes, there is some 'evidence'. We actually got it as an exercise in a

<p>Sorry, I was a bit obscure there. This was just some personal
<br>
theorizing out the universal ancestor which got into my answer.
<br>
<p>What I was getting at was that the earliest replicators were probably
<br>
quite happy if they managed to replicate, never mind fidelity. The
<br>
mutation rate was very high, making species more like viral
<br>
quasi-species with very fuzzy borders. Horizontal gene transfer was
<br>
likely extremely high, and Carl Woese has suggested that there was a
<br>
single kind of universal ancestor. Essentially everything was the same
<br>
diffuse species, where every cell exchanged genetic material rather
<br>
promiscously with the others. In this mess the three base pair code,
<br>
ribosomes, protein based phenotype and lipid membranes developed. Once
<br>
the &quot;infrastructure&quot; surrounding the genes became good enough, various
<br>
kingdoms crystailsed from the universal ancestors by no longer sharing
<br>
genes freely.
