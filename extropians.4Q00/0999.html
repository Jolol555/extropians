<em>&gt; Hmm. A good idea, I suppose. Although in Slash clones you do get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; author's mailto: link which you can click to email them *if* the author
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chooses to make their personal email address avaialble to the public.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am often frustrated because the nature of slash discussions are such
<br>
that the comments on a particular point are arranged according to
<br>
responder trees between the subject.  This makes it difficult to
<br>
impossible to see a time based collection of all responses as they are
<br>
spread among the different subtrees.  The best would be if the system
<br>
came with software to extract out the message base and rearrange it in
<br>
various canned (or if one is so inclined) novel ways.  I would like to
<br>
be able to do things like searches within all messages in response to a
<br>
certain post and/or within all messages. I can do some of this with
<br>
standard Unix style mail files.  But I lose a lot of this ability under
<br>
slash.  
<br>
<p>The threading is again in the subject(author-reply1 tree,
<br>
author-reply2-tree, .. author-replyn tree) form.  I can't even see all
<br>
the replies to the subject for a given author if they have responded
<br>
within multiple subtrees.  This is not a very effective type of
<br>
threading for the type of information I want.
<br>
<p>For discussions you need to be able to see the set of ideas and the
<br>
variations that have arisen and how they evolved over time and to
<br>
cross-cut any particular rigid organization of the information like the
<br>
slash response-trees to work toward clarification and resolution.  A
<br>
rigid hiearchical structure on the offerings to the &quot;discussion&quot; simply
<br>
has the effect of enabling the conversation to dribble off into ever
<br>
smaller streamlets of increasingly less conclusive or inclusive remarks
<br>
more often than not.  It is structurally counter-productive to good
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I welcome specific suggestions, though. Even if it's just one thing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mailing list does that the Extropy Institute slash site
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.extrodot.org/">http://www.extrodot.org/</a>) doesn't currently do. You may be surprised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by what sorts of suggestions we *could* incorporate, and just haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought of or haven't realized they could be useful to somebody.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Frankly I'm surprised to see resistance to innovation on *this* list.
</em><br>
<p>I have little resistance to something actually better.  I have a lot of
<br>
resistance to things that are new but keep me from being able to do
<br>
things I already knew how to do (although often clumsily) before.  As an
<br>
extropian I am interested in innovations that increase my capabilities
<br>
and understanding.  I am not interested in innovation simply for
<br>
innovation's sake.  I have been around long enough to see all too many
<br>
&quot;innovations&quot; that were actually less capable than what was done before
<br>
in crical areas while providing some welcome newness in others.
