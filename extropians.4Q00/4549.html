<em>&gt; Ok, I'm cheating here.  Star Wars did it first.  But this is where Lucas

transported
<br>
<em>&gt; us to a universe so epic, so mythical, and so tremendously rich of story
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; milieu.  ATATs storming the surface of Hoth, Luke in the caves of Dagobah
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (creepy,) The Imperial pursuit into the asteroid field, Cloud City-- and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were you aware that Darth Vader is Luke's father?!  Dude, The Matrix has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got -nothing- on this baby.
</em><br>
<p>This movie bored me when I first saw it; somehow it missed something for me,
<br>
and still does. Star Wars 1 (3?) is the thing.
<br>
<p>I also loved Star Wars 4 (is that 1?), you know, the most recent one. I do
<br>
have a facination for the purile, and the special effects made me drool all
<br>
over my shirt.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.  Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, a sequel, but we all know the first one sucked.  Why's this on my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a.) Two words: STAR TREK.  This is one of the big grand daddys of the
</em><br>
genre.
<br>
<em>&gt; 'Nuff said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b.) Epic Cinematic Storytelling.  This one turns the screws on you right
</em><br>
at
<br>
<em>&gt; the start and doesn't let up.  Ricardo is totally and cunningly over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; top-- one of the finest super-villains of all time.  The space-ship
</em><br>
battles
<br>
<em>&gt; in this one *still* look good. (Go figure.  Makes you realize that CG
</em><br>
still
<br>
<em>&gt; has a long ways to go.)  The score in this movie kicks ass-- epic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gladiatorial space combat opera.  The action is -smart-, they keep
</em><br>
throwing
<br>
<em>&gt; in little twists to keep you on your toes.  Things crawl into people's
</em><br>
ears!
<br>
<em>&gt; Spock dies!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>How about First Contact? That one blew me away (space suits in Star
<br>
Trek?!?!). Actually, it was a really awesome space horror movie (similar
<br>
genre as Alien, but with better cleaners?), intertwined with a
<br>
worse-than-mediocre adventures-on-earth-of-the-past story.
<br>
<p>Reminds me of Contact, an incredibly gripping sci-fi locked in battle with a
<br>
ham fisted &quot;people&quot; story with all the subtlety of a house brick (the brick
<br>
wins in the end). Don't get me wrong, I like a good people story, but not
<br>
when it's written by a sci-fi author.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you haven't seen this one in a while, do yourself a favor, grab the DVD
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and turn the volume up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3a.)  Brazil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, this one's personal preference: it clearly didn't have big-time
</em><br>
impact
<br>
<em>&gt; on the genre.  In fact, it probably doesn't even qualify as Sci-Fi action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this is a brilliant, brilliant movie and one of my all time favorites
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; all time favoriteness.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, a good one. I really like brazil. Pacing was a little sloooow though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3b.) The Matrix
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seldom has a movie so clearly captured, redefined and cinemized the action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensibilities of its era.  This flick -oozes- savvy style.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cinematography!  John Gaeta should be made President.  The script is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly brilliant, but lord, the implementation...!  Here's the flick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that makes green filters, flo-motion, mirrored surfaces, black leather and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cell phones impossibly cool.  It will likely be remembered as the defining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Virtual Reality flick, and it will be endlessly copied.  But why, oh why,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are they making a sequel to this movie?!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I tried to write a list of what I hated about this movie... it's too much,
<br>
too intertwined. It was like a geek convention got together and brainstormed
<br>
a list of the coolest stuff they'd like to see in a movie. This list was
<br>
then handed to the special effects department of an ad agency, who got to
<br>
work. At some late stage a director was employed to chop this mishmash
<br>
together into one movie, the basic goal being to add some superficial flow
<br>
from each otherwise unrelated concept to the next.
<br>
<p>It would have been excellent if used for a music video. As a movie... nah.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Runners Up:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Blade Runner -- Wow.  This is one of the best looking and sounding movies
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; all time.  Probably will be for the foreseeable future.  Repeat: wow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alien -- The first, best, creepiest, most atmospheric monsters-in-space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movie ever.
</em><br>
<p>A bit dull. Every sci fi fan who ever existed seems to love this movie, so I
<br>
don't know why I don't. I've rented the director's cut a few times and
<br>
watched it over... it's so embarrassing; it just doesn't grab me (although I
<br>
am a huge Rutger Hauer fan).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; T2 -- This movie kicks ass; who needs a plot when you've got Arnie and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unrelenting action?
</em><br>
<p>I thought the plot was ok; better than the Matrix, anyway. I was pretty
<br>
happy with how it followed on from T1. Did I miss some big problems?
<br>
<p>The Guns 'n' Roses references do seem a little dated now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Back to the Future -- I LOVED this movie.  I still do.  Come on dude, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got a time traveling DeLorean.
</em><br>
<p>urrghh
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Highlander -- Is this Sci-Fi?  A *classic.*
</em><br>
<p>Yup, liked it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Clockwork Orange -- This one got in my head.
</em><br>
<p>Never seen it; must do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p><p>OK, I'll have to do better than the first list I made.
<br>
<p>Aliens: I disagree that this is a flashy followup to a substantial movie. I
<br>
think they both stand alone as good movies. Alien was a horror movie,
<br>
however, not action (hence my omission of it); Aliens is the best
<br>
sci-fi-action movie (if there is such a category) that I can think of. Get
<br>
the director's cut, btw, it's makes sense.
<br>
<p>Die-hard: On reflection, it's not sci-fi at all, is it? I want to be Hans
<br>
Gruber (without losing)... I loved this movie.
<br>
<p>Didn't someone mention Mad Max in another post? Big thumbs up from me! Of
<br>
course, Waterworld craps all over it (hoo hoo hoo!)
<br>
<p>Has anyone been watching/watched the series &quot;Farscape&quot; recently? Very cool!
<br>
Switch off brain, enjoy strangely coloured women (Kirk would go beresk).
<br>
It's full of Aussie soap stars in cameo roles, which is fairly weird.
<br>
<p>If you can ever find it, get &quot;Hell comes to Frog Town&quot;, starring Rowdy Roddy
<br>
Piper. Straight to video, made sometime in the 80s. Now THAT is a movie!
<br>
