</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Putting the person instead in a VR with karmic consequence mode turned

</em><br>
<p>That is an unacceptable violation of individual freedoms.  If someone *wants*
<br>
to walk into an environment with karmic consequences, they have the right to
<br>
do so.  Nobody has the right to impose that on them.  Once the Sysop Scenario
<br>
is achieved - once &quot;society&quot; has the technological power to upload a criminal
<br>
into a karmic environment - society no longer has any conceivable right to do
<br>
so.  The criminal is no longer a threat to anyone.  There's no need to
<br>
discourage future crimes.
<br>
<p>Pain is *never* an intrinsic good, no matter who it happens to!  Certain
<br>
people, by their actions, make themselves more &quot;targetable&quot; than others - if
<br>
either a murderer or an innocent human must die, then it might as well be the
<br>
murderer.  Adolf Hitler, for example, is so targetable that we could shoot him
<br>
on the million-to-one off-chance that it might save someone's life.  But once
<br>
there's no longer any need for *anyone* to suffer, then nobody is targetable -
<br>
not even Adolf Hitler.
