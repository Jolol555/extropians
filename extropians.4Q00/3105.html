<p>
&nbsp;From the opening description of David Brin (whose books I've seen on 
<br>
the shelf, but I've never read), I was anticipating a good thought 
<br>
provoking article.
<br>
<p>Instead, Mr. Brin didn't really argue anything in a substantive 
<br>
manner.  The little snippets that almost looked like sub-arguments 
<br>
were so loaded with false dilemmas and straw men that I gave up any 
<br>
idea of pointing them all out.
<br>
<p>I can't help but wonder:  This guy writes for a living?  And he's a 
<br>
&quot;scientist&quot;?  Umm, okay.
<br>
<p>The line that had me scratching my head the most was this one:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I admit turning around and often voting for Democrats in general elections.
</em><br>
<p>He claims to be mostly a Libertarian, but he actually votes for Democrats.
<br>
<p>What a sadly conflicted individual.  It's no wonder that he takes 
<br>
such a &quot;logical relativism&quot; stance to ideologies.  He has no cohesive 
<br>
logic in his own political philosophy, so naturally no one else's 
<br>
ideology is logical either.  Bleah.
<br>
<p>He might as well be a liberal atheist who would vote for Gary Bauer 
<br>
running on some Constitution Party ticket.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
