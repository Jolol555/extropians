There is nothing &quot;sensible&quot; about it except that it is factual and
<br>
understanding of where we are. It has nothing to do with whether or not
<br>
you or I will fight against death and dying for all we're worth.  But
<br>
the fight cannot be conducted by failing to acknowledge what is or by
<br>
condemning everyone that disagrees.  We want to beat this think in
<br>
reality after all.
