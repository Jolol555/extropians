</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a Navy project, human habitable in design, final design had the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the heat shield; and never flew. As I recall, there were some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preliminary studies of twin-can &quot;swinging&quot; MOL-like designs, with a SNAP
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuke reactor at the &quot;far&quot; end. It seems oversilly to me for even the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; '60s fedgov to name an Agena with a docking collar a Manned Orbiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Laboratory.
</em><br>
<p>My father was involved in developing cameras at Itek for the Corona and MOL
<br>
projects. He told me about the amazing amount of compartementalization between
<br>
projects there. He said they had several different spysat camera projects going
<br>
on at the same time, and people from different projects could not share info
<br>
with other projects, so each team had to solve the same problems by themselves.
<br>
When a project finished, they would be told instead that it was 'cancelled', but
<br>
all the stuff they built and at least one person from the team would get sent
<br>
off to either the NRO, Canaveral, Langley, or Vandenberg, never to be heard from
<br>
again.... From my own research, it seems that the Air Force was launching MOL's
<br>
on Titan launchers from Vandenberg at least up into the early 80's. The MOL was
<br>
derived from the Agena.

<p>I just downloaded some nice pics the other day by a Gemini astronaut showing an
<br>
Agena hanging below the Gemini capsule from a thether, with earth in the

background.
