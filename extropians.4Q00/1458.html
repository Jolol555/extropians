<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I was misinformed concerning the ExI.  If I understand 
<br>
the other postings correctly, I should have realized that sending money to 
<br>
the ExI is just like sending money to CARE or to the Red Cross.  The 
<br>
difference is that by sending money to the ExI one gets the satisfaction of 
<br>
knowing that one supports &quot;the revolution.&quot;  I have to admit that I never 
<br>
realized this.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is a very good point.  And Ian isn't the only one
<br>
that has experienced this.  The free sign up page seems to promise
<br>
lots to people obviously miss setting people's expectations.  I think
<br>
we should always be careful not to over set expectations.  We should
<br>
only make promises which will be over delivered, never under
<br>
delivered.  Can we get these pages changed so as not to over set
<br>
people's expectations?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It is hard to feel any community spirit with an organization that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't seem to care about its members, and which doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicate with you, in fact doesn't even reply to your messages.
</em><br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is yet another very good point.  I've struggle with this
<br>
issue myself.  Every week we have many many people wanting to sign up
<br>
for the free membership.  I bet most, if not all of them feel ignored
<br>
like Ian.  With some good &quot;fellowshipping&quot; I bet we could make people
<br>
like Ian, myself, and everyone feel much more welcome and wanted.  How
<br>
can we set up a system that, in an extropian way, promotes and
<br>
supports this kind of stuff?
