<p>Well gee, I always thought women with 2 PhDs were tres tres chic.

<p>Spike, you only get *temporary* membership in the club unless
<br>
you take those &quot;back of the envelope&quot; calcs, format them, put
<br>
them on the net *linked* to the references and respond to
<br>
questions that people ask about them!
<br>
<p>Think of all of the times someone else will repeat all of that
<br>
work because you threw away those envolopes (remember, I've
<br>
been to your house and I didn't see any envelopes, so I assuming
<br>
you throw them away.  Or perhaps they are *virtual* envelopes...
<br>
We trust you enough that we would only occasionally suspect
<br>
they are &quot;imaginary&quot; envelopes).
<br>
<p>As I recall Amara was right and I was investigating the dust
<br>
from the point of view of missing baryonic matter, esp. carbon.
<br>
For those who are unaware of it the recent surveys of the cosmic
<br>
background radiation are suggesting that there is more baryonic
<br>
matter in the universe than current nucleosynthesis theories would
<br>
suggest.  So the theorists are having a very difficult time
<br>
reconciling things with the experimental physicists.  Its *very*
<br>
interesting though that Eric was asking about it.  Perhaps IMM may
<br>
be working on some NASA grants into the impact of nanotechnology
<br>
on various NASA agendas (such as interstellar travel).  Just as
<br>
a historical tidbit, Eric many years ago did look at the astronomy
<br>
plates at MIT to see if there were galaxies that had &quot;dark regions&quot;
<br>
that could be interpreted as signs of expanding (colonizing)
<br>
civilizations.  He didn't discover any.
<br>
<p>The way the problem of interstellar dust (and to a lesser extent
<br>
cosmic rays) was handled by the British Project Daedalus study
<br>
was to put an ablative shield on the front of the spacecraft.
<br>
I believe they were using boron, presumably because of its
<br>
light weight and high melting point.  Spike, you might want
<br>
to redo the calculations with Tungsten.  If anyone wants it,
<br>
I've got the entire study converted to MS-Word.  It hasn't
<br>
been proofed or converted to hypertext yet unfortunately.
<br>
<p>I don't believe the shield they used was that thick,
<br>
certainly not the km that Spike has suggested.
<br>
Of course it depends on what speed they were going
<br>
(I don't think it was as high as 0.1c) and what dust
<br>
density they used.  Other methods that might be useful
<br>
would be magnetic shielding.  The question is does
<br>
the dust carry a charge?
<br>
<p>I also can't believe you are talking about interstellar
<br>
travel with short-lived individuals (though I haven't
<br>
followed the thread to its origin).  That makes no sense
<br>
at all.  Any civilization that has the energy to waste
<br>
on interstellar travel, certainly will have engineered
<br>
itself so as to be &quot;non-aging&quot;.  You also have to have some
<br>
interesting entertainment on those long voyages or preferably
<br>
put the individuals in &quot;biostasis&quot;.  But longer biostasis periods
<br>
will either require periodic reactivation to repair the accumulated
<br>
radiation damage or a *really* hefty shield around the stasis chamber.
<br>
<p>An interesting comparison would be the energy requirements to
<br>
accelerate and decelerate the ship vis-a-vis the energy requirements
<br>
to maintain 100W individuals over the duration of the trip.
<br>
<p>Now the interesting thing to my mind is the fact that you don't
<br>
need the massive fusion propulsion system envisioned by the
<br>
Project Daedalus folks.  You construct big mass drivers and/or
<br>
laser systems in the local star system to launch lightweight
<br>
ships.  You can slow down on the far end using magnetic braking
<br>
or the leading light sail reflecting back at the ship powered
<br>
by long distance laser power transmission.
<br>
<p>Of course, much better is to send Spike's maaany km of ice
<br>
arranged as a cylinder a few mm in diameter with a solar-system
<br>
engineering nanobot attached to the back end.  If the nanobot
<br>
survives the cosmic radiation (still an unresolved question
<br>
in my mind), then it can pre-engineer the target solar system
<br>
to provide you with a nice safe happy landing when you arrive
<br>
on the slow boat and pop out of your biostasis chamber.
<br>
<p>Keep this in mind, 1% of the power available to us in our solar
<br>
system allows us to power ~10 billion 100 TW laser beams.
<br>
If you want to do some interesting calculations Spike,
<br>
see what the mass limits and times required would be on
<br>
what you can accelerate to 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 c with that
<br>
kind of power at your disposal.
<br>
<p>Oh, yes, and as one final tidbit, courtesy of the All Sky
<br>
Automated Survey data, I now have definitive candidates for
<br>
stars going &quot;dark&quot;.  They may be nothing more than long
<br>
term variable stars, or they might just be....
