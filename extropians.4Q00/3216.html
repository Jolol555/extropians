I personally think those who demand the perpetuation of personal &quot;privacy&quot;
<br>
in a future that will live and breath on the unrestricted communication and
<br>
processing of ever increasing amounts of information are unknowing Luddites.
<br>
As I see it our ultimate &quot;purpose,&quot; if there is one, is to facillitate the
<br>
efficient storage, transmission and processing of data.  Everything at its
<br>
core is information and the more of it we can grasp and utilize, the better
<br>
off we will be.  The *only* difference between man and God is access to, and
<br>
the ability to usefully exploit, information.
<br>
<p>So, on the one hand you say you are an Extropian hoping one day to become
<br>
Uberman.  On the other hand you want to put up impenetrable road blocks on
<br>
the information super-highway.  Look in the mirror.  What do you call
<br>
yourself?

<p><em>&gt; &quot;Temporarily&quot;. You said it, not me. Face and behavior-noticing neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nets will be cheap enough to peel off and stick like Britney stickers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someday, probably sooner than we'd like. So gross location and activity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monitoring is basically a given. This has a big impact on what a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average people would construe as &quot;privacy&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cryptocurrency, Mixmaster, etc. are well and good, but as I think Bruce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Schneier likes to put it, some approaches to security are like putting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single fence picket a mile high in the ground and hoping all your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adversaries run into it and knock themselves unconscious.
