<p>Taking the Initiative
<br>
<p>Robert Coontz and Phil Szuromi
<br>
<p>It has been almost a decade since Science devoted a special issue to
<br>
nanotechnology, and even the title of that issue (&quot;Engineering a Small
<br>
World,&quot; 29 November 1991) reflected the scarcity of actual working
<br>
nanotechnology at the time. Like others, we pointed to Richard
<br>
Feynman's 1959 lecture &quot;There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom&quot; to
<br>
provide some justification for why nanotechnology would emerge as a
<br>
discipline from early efforts in atomic imaging and
<br>
nanofabrication. The present special issue can reflect only some of
<br>
the current trends in this rapidly expanding area.
<br>
<p>In the News section (p. 1524), writer Robert Service surveys
<br>
nanotechnology's near-term prospects: the role of funding infusions,
<br>
such as the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative and its European
<br>
and Japanese counterparts, and the real promise of new materials and
<br>
devices. He also takes a jaundiced view of some of the prophecies of
<br>
boom and doom made by the field's boosters and critics. Meanwhile,
<br>
amid the nanohype, researchers are forging ahead on several exciting
<br>
fronts. Short profiles of five research groups aim to give some sense
<br>
of the range of work now under way throughout the world, without
<br>
pretending to be exemplary or comprehensive.
<br>
<p>Three Reviews focus mainly on nanomechanics, which builds on (or
<br>
perhaps below) the advances that have been witnessed in
<br>
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Some of the MEMS advances are
<br>
stunning enough in themselves. For example, micromirror arrays
<br>
developed at Lucent can be tilted to steer light beams from one
<br>
channel to another for routing fiber-optic signals. Craighead
<br>
(p. 1532) discusses how even smaller nanoelectromechanical systems
<br>
(NEMS) will have higher resonant frequencies and lower masses that
<br>
will facilitate several new applications. Complex freestanding
<br>
structures can now be fabricated and used, for example, to sense
<br>
adsorbed mass, or as radiofrequency devices in the 1- to 10-megahertz
<br>
range. These structures can be set in motion with applied electrical
<br>
fields or with piezoelectric driving of supports.  Sacrificial
<br>
fabrication can also be used to create channel structures of varying
<br>
complexity for fluidic systems and molecular separations.
<br>
<p>Although many nanomechanical systems have been fabricated in hard,
<br>
inorganic materials, polymeric materials are now being exploited for
<br>
micromechanics and nanofabrication. Quake and Scherer (p. 1536) point
<br>
out that soft polymeric systems have some natural advantages in
<br>
fluidics, in that the pumps and valves used in &quot;labs on chips&quot;
<br>
normally need soft seals and seats to work seamlessly. Soft materials
<br>
can be molded and assembled in layers to leave complex fluidic
<br>
networks or to create diffractive optical elements.
<br>
<p>Producing complex movements in devices is still a challenge,
<br>
especially for potential applications in biological systems. Jager et
<br>
al. (p. 1540) review how conducting polymers could solve some
<br>
problems.  Bimorph actuators produce movement through the differential
<br>
expansion of a layer of one material pressed against a dissimilar
<br>
material. In polypyrrole-gold bimorphs, an applied electrical field
<br>
creates a volume change in the polymer that produces motion (and can
<br>
even peel a newly fabricated device from its supports).  These
<br>
actuators could find use as cell manipulators or as microrobots, all
<br>
within a cellular milieu.
<br>
<p>Nanotechnologists are now creating devices the performance of which
<br>
will be tested and improved by new experiments and by more accurate
<br>
theoretical treatments. Although there is still plenty of &quot;room at the
<br>
bottom,&quot; researchers have done much more than stake out claim sites:
<br>
They are digging in.
