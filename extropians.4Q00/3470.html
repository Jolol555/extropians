<p>
<em>&gt; I've been reading the ideas of Tim Berners-Lee, the man who can rightly be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said to have invented the web.  The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; founded is now promoting XML as a lingua franca for the web.  Lee sees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; XML as a way to promote automated web reading, so that web pages can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present data in machine-readable XML which is automatically translated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to nice looking HTML for humans.  The result will be that both humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and their software agents can browse the web with ease.  Lee calls this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;Semantic Web&quot; and describes it as an important part of his initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vision of what the web could become.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I've read Berner-Lee saying that he never intended hand-coding of HTML, and
<br>
that the first web-related application was a primitive WYZIWYG html editor
<br>
that he built himself.
<br>
<p>The goals of machine readability, etc, etc, of XML are laudable. How long do
<br>
you reckon they'll last in the face of big commercial interests &amp; a zillion
<br>
(well, many million) users of various flavours, with their own ideas about
<br>
how they want to use this thing called the web?
