<p>This reading, probably supported by the script, alas, rather vitiates any
<br>
non-allegorical merit the movie might have had. It's as if the Alphas and
<br>
Deltas in BRAVE NEW WORLD really *weren't* drastically different, just
<br>
viciously labelled. That does happen in our world, of course, but the point
<br>
about sf is that we can dramatize worlds in which GM speciates humanity *in
<br>
fact*; as in, e.g., Frank Herbert's rather flawed but still interesting THE
<br>
EYES OF HEISENBERG.
<br>
<p>Anyone interesting in testing such interpretations against the script can

find it at

<p>(I haven't yet had time to read it through. But here's a bit about the
<br>
stigmatized `invalids' or `genojunk':
<br>
<p>`They are the &quot;healthy ill&quot;. They don't actually have anything yet - they
<br>
may never. But since few of the pre-conditions can be cured or reversed, it
<br>
is easier to treat them as if they were already sick.'
<br>
<p>On the other hand, Vincent's Genetic Quotient shows that he has a
<br>
`congenital heart condition' that had a 0.8 probability of killing him by
<br>
now. My impression is that such a disorder is a ticking time bomb; it's not
<br>
like an on/off switch where he might have had the good luck to fall into
<br>
the 20 percent who could suffer no ill effects at all.)
