<em>&gt; I make no assertion on the legitimacy of the following case, but it strikes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me as far from incoherent let alone meaningless:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the first instance, the world's natural abundance has no owners. People
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emerge in communities, with shared language and skills, who learn to turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this abundance to their advantage. This wealth can be broadly shared (by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some algorithm of distribution), or sequestered to the possession of a few,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often by force of arms. If theft is the wrongful confiscation of hard-won
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or even widely available wealth (naturally occurring, cultivated or wholly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrived by intelligent human effort), it is easy to see how the fiat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertion of `property' might be regarded with indignation as theft from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the commonwealth or commonweal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>But of course the problem with this is that except for a few extremely
<br>
blessed and temperate spots on earth very little is simply there for the
<br>
taking for human needs.  Agriculture had to be invented before we could
<br>
go beyond hunter/gatherer stage.  Even at that earlier level not every
<br>
person participated equally in finding or preparing food and not every
<br>
person had an equal share.  If one believes that intelligence and
<br>
ambition just flow naturally and have nothing to do with an individual's
<br>
choices and work and merit then I suppose one could claim that that
<br>
individual does not have first rights to the fruits of their efforts. 
<br>
But not otherwise.  Natural materials are not wealth until shaped by
<br>
human minds and hands.  A forest of trees by itself with no use made of
<br>
it is naturally beautiful but it is not wealth.  
<br>
<p>Property may make less sense in its current manifestation post nanotech
<br>
when all things are easily abundant.  But in the meantime property
<br>
serves a quite useful purpose of apportioning the limited natural and
<br>
manmade goods and services according (hopefully) to who can make the
<br>
best use of them.  One can argue that a capitalist money based system is
<br>
not the best way to determine this or to compete for limited resources. 
<br>
But it has not been bested by any other alternative as of yet.  
<br>
<p>And of course the fundamental right to property grows out of one's right
<br>
to one's own life and to make one's own decisions and to live with the
<br>
consequences.  If one has no right to property then there is no right to
<br>
one's life or to the outcome of one's decisions.  
<br>
<p>I do believe that property in many realms of ideas, especially software,
<br>
is theft however.  Or not exactly theft, but that applying property
<br>
notions to software diminishes us and our abilities.
