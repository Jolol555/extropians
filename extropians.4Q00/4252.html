<p>Under recent supreme court ruling (Boy Scouts of America), you are free
<br>
to associate and NOT associate with others based on moral/religious
<br>
principles, which is why the BSA could prohibit gay members but cannot
<br>
prohibit black members. Under this logic, for example, a Muslim group
<br>
could prohibit female members because the Koran says so, but the Elks
<br>
cannot prohibit female members because they have no religious reason to
<br>
object to their presence.
<br>
There is significant argument that constitutional prohibitions on
<br>
discrimination only apply to governments and not on individuals. Saying
<br>
that you have a right to belong to my club even if I formed that club
<br>
specifically for the purpose of having someplace to go where you are not
<br>
present is a violation of my right of free association. If your right of
<br>
association is greater than my right of association, then that is a
<br>
violation of the equal protection clause, or else the right really
<br>
doesn't exist as a right, but a priviledge that can be given or taken
<br>
away. The right of association is a right of 'free association' NOT
<br>
'forced association'. This is why forced busing, hiring quotas, etc are
<br>
technically unconstitutional.
<br>
Because governments are corporations which all of us are members of,
<br>
then that government cannot exclude one citizen more than another, which
<br>
is why only governments are bound under these discrimination laws.
