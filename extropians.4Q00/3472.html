<em>&gt; No, it's not a straw man argument, I'm not asserting something which isn't

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 2) It wasn't yours anyway.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it wasn't.  And no one has a right to benefits stolen by force
<br>
from others.  Ever.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      I may (and largely do) agree with that, but that isn't the point. You WILL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BE taking away things people want when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you get the government to stop doing the things you don't want it to do. I never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  said it was wrong to stop it, I think (mostly)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it IS stealing. What I am saying is that we're a minority in this opinion, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter how well we can back this up (facts, logic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons), but it's not something anyone wants to admit. We pretend that by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouting louder we're getting through, but what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're doing is making sure we never get listened to. Ever. I know this for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, from talking to people who make valid points
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about welfare, from their own set of values, there's a point where your facts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons, arguments, etc. mean nothing, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are just causing them to shut you out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      As long as that is true, you have to deal with it as it is, not as you wish
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it to be. We're not going to change people's minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by telling them they're wrong, that it's ok for some people to starve while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others are billionaires, that the money they get from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government (and have gotten all their lives) isn't theirs.
</em><br>
<p>Will you change there minds by telling them they are right when they are
<br>
not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      My point, here, is that it doesn't matter how much we 'know' we're right,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are far too few of us to win this fight, this way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, now what? How do we make things better? Things are already as they are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given how marginalized libertarians (and/or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians) are, what good does it do to pretend it's otherwise, or act as if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plains facts (about reality) don't exist?
</em><br>
<p>No one is denying any plain facts of this type.  But not mentioning the
<br>
truth because it is unpopular is surely no solution to anything.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      Also, here is my semantic alteration point - you say is it wrong to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force to stop force. What does force mean? Does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you mean by it match what most people mean by it? If not, do they know what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you mean when you say it? I've seen an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument to counter the no-force initiation argument about taxes, and it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather simple - taxes are the price you pay for living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a modern, industrial country.
</em><br>
<p>Those are simply empty sounds.  That there is this high cost due to
<br>
taxes does not at all show that taxes are a justified or necessary cost
<br>
of living in a modern society.  You can make a pretty strong argument
<br>
that the society would be a heck of a lot more modern without taxes or
<br>
at least without such high taxes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Do I agree with that? No, but again, I'm in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  minority on this. So, you say, it's force to make me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pay taxes, it's countered with 'not by any accepted definition of force'. Try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using the argument about police coming to jail you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you don't pay taxes, and they might shoot you. I guarantee you're going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find people who will blame you for not paying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your taxes. And, again, there are more of them than us, and probably always will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  be.
</em><br>
<p>The truth is not a matter of numbers.  We are supposed to be a republic
<br>
not an unlimited democracy.  Fundamental rights are supposed to be
<br>
inviolate by the State in this country.  Pragmatic means of living as
<br>
congruently as possible with the truth do need to take numbers into
<br>
consideration though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      There 'seems' to be an anti-government theme in our culture, but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know how valid it is. I know people get angry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about specific governmental actions, but  I really don't think there's a general
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  'Government = bad' sentiment. I have friends,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquaintances, co-workers, etc. from a large portion of the (American) political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  spectrum, and almost none of them are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the simple existence of government. Given that, arguing that government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't be allowed to do anything will fall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on deaf ears.
</em><br>
<p>Don't start there.  Start by asking how many people actually are afraid
<br>
of their government.  Ask how many worry that their government will
<br>
erode their savings, cause conditions that will seriously erode their
<br>
medical alternatives, harm the business cycle enough to threaten their
<br>
jobs, come after them with a tax audit from hell and possible confiscate
<br>
some of their goods as well as money as has happened to some of their
<br>
friends and acquantainances. Ask how many think  you just might end up
<br>
killed or imprisoned on some trumped up charge or with your economic
<br>
health and career ruined if you rock the boat too much.  Ask how many of
<br>
them think it makes sense that this supposedly freest of countries has
<br>
more people in jail than any other per capita.  Ask if they think it is
<br>
ok that the government can kick in their door at any time without
<br>
showing a warrant or even identifying themselves and terrorize their
<br>
household and even accidentally kill or maim some members on the basis
<br>
of a rumor of drug involvement.  If they don't believe these things are
<br>
allowed by current statutes or that they happen then show them the
<br>
facts.  Don't start by telling them all government is bad.  Show them
<br>
the one they have is in many respects bad and getting worse and more
<br>
dangerous by the day.  Then start explaining the roots of how it got to
<br>
be that way and what sorts of roots will avoid a lot of these evils.
