Hi all!
<br>
<p>After reading so many posts about parent's reactions on their children's
<br>
interests, I feel so lucky to have my Mom. About the same time I became
<br>
Transhumanist, she was honestly interested in what I was interested in.
<br>
And became a Transhumanist herself. Now she sits for hours in front of
<br>
her computer, reading all messages from the German Transhumanist Group
<br>
DE:Trans. And she hopes her English will become better, so she can read
<br>
the Extropians, too. She was and still is the only female person I can
<br>
talk with about Sysop scenarios, cryonics (she's a member of CI, too)
<br>
and uploading.
<br>
<p>But I don't think my Mom's the only Mom that doesn't dislike
<br>
Transhumanist ideas. I would be very interested to hear about your
<br>
experiences with your parents or other family members.
<br>
<p>If this question has been brought up earlier already, I apologize for
<br>
repeating it.
<br>
<p>Best wishes + long life  
<br>
