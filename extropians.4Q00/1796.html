<em>&gt; &gt; And what 'commercial meat' are you talking about? Typically cornfed beef
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is the main culprit in any meat diet, but free range beef is as healthy as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beans, fish, or chicken. The danger of the modern meat diet comes from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; practice of raising the animals on a corn diet in unsanitary conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with little exercise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What exactly is your beef with cornfed beef? Is it the fact that the cattle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eat corn, the fact that they're finished on feedlots, or both? I raise myown beef and finish them for a couple months on sweetfeed (grain products
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including corn + molasses) plus grass. If I should be avoiding all corn, I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to know that, and why. Of course my cattle are hormone free and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only chemicals I use are those necessary for pest control--and I use them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less often than I should, due mostly to procrastination.
</em><br>
<p>Any cornfed domestic animal will have much higher fat and cholesterol levels
<br>
than ones fed on the range. Of course, fatty foods taste better to many people,
<br>
and its easier to bulk your animals up on corn than grass, so its more
<br>
profitable for the farmer to operate on a corn diet of various degrees. I don't
<br>
know the biochemical differences between corn and other grains like wheat or
<br>
rice, but it is the newest major domesticated grain, and thus the least likely
<br>
for humans or their domesticated animals to be adapted to digesting efficiently
<br>
or healthfully. I can understand the draw, as I appreciate the taste of a couple
<br>
ears of ripe Butter and Sugar corn in a nice fall barbecue, but I'm sure if
<br>
given the chance I'd develop a taste for crack if I could legally buy a dozen
<br>
hits for a dollar. Thats essentially what corn is: its the crack cocaine of
<br>
domesticated grains, and nearly as bad for you as cane sugar.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My own meat diet consists primarily of fish, eggs, venison, chicken, buffalo,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and ostrich, with possibly 5-10% beef somewhere in there, though I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; eliminated beef completely in the last month to measurable benefit. Rice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pasta, tomatos, salads, mushrooms, broccoli, and other veggies make up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just out of curiosity--I don't doubt your word--but what measurable benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can you attribute to cutting out 5-10% beef?  And what is the basis of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percentage: calories of total diet, protein by weight, or what?
</em><br>
<p>I can't tell you any specifics. I cut it out, and I'm now much better for it. I
<br>
don't count calories or weigh myself, as I don't want to develop any obsessive
<br>
behaviors in my diet... It is, though, difficult to not notice a difference in
<br>
waist size of four inches.
