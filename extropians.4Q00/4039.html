From: Damien Raphael Sullivan
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A company uses a new chemical, dumps it, and if and when sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evidence is found against it then it may be banned.  But lots of new
</em><br>
chemicals
<br>
<em>&gt;are produced, probably outpacing regulatory inspection.
</em><br>
<p>Oh perhaps you are talking US law. I am talking Danish law which is
<br>
certainly more strict than the US then.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Soot particles don't accumulate in fish at 2000x environmental
</em><br>
concentrations,
<br>
<em>&gt;as far as I know.  Some radioactive waste does; radioactive dumping is
</em><br>
banned.
<br>
<p>I was trying to show a point by providing a range of examples, that should
<br>
illustrate my meaning when seen together from a little higher view. The next
<br>
meta level so to speak. You are counter arguing by trying to show that every
<br>
little example is wrong. I know that some of these examples are wrong, but
<br>
that is experience speaking. But nobody could know beforehand that they
<br>
where wrong.
<br>
<p>Neither can we always know it today when trying new stuff out. Proving a
<br>
negative is practically impossible. So we are back to the gamble again. Take
<br>
a chance but try to balance the risk with the possible reward.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The usual scientific argument against the fear of transmission wire fields
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt;that the radiation is too pathetic to plausibly have any effect; if
</em><br>
statistics
<br>
<em>&gt;proved there was an effect, it'd be New Science. The plausibility of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;persistent and accumulative chemical causing damage is way higher.
</em><br>
<p>As I said before. We know this now. We didn't before. Should we have stopped
<br>
electricity until we knew what we know now? Because then we would never had
<br>
known what we know now about electricity. Sort of a catch 22.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Fertilizers certainly are accumulative and is killing the low waters
</em><br>
around
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; here.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think they are accumulative.  They get used as food.  They don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poison things, they feed algae which swamp the area.
</em><br>
<p>If there is no movement in the water, as is the case in some of the low
<br>
waters here, and the removal of the fertilizers happens slower than the
<br>
amount added each year, I would call that accumulative. But then again it is
<br>
not really the point here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And now that we're wealthy we can afford to be more cautious.  Especially
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt;the greater wealth gives us more power to fuck up if the risk happens.
</em><br>
<p>I am still not wealthy enough to live &quot;forever&quot;. Until I am there is nothing
<br>
gained for me to slow any economic/technological growth.
<br>
<p>More TV sets, more cars, bigger houses etc. are really nothing compared to
<br>
the wealth of a (really)long life to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, I hardly agree with experiment-breaking.  That's evil.  But not all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people concerned with the environment are anti-science Greens.  Some of
</em><br>
them
<br>
<em>&gt;are scientists.
</em><br>
<p>I am as concerned about the enviroment as the next guy. That is not really
<br>
the point. I just don't want us to be overly cautious because of some eco
<br>
fanatics.
<br>
<p>(Not counting you in as one ;-) I DO mean the real fanatics.)
<br>
<p>Regards Max M Rasmussen
