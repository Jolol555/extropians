<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;The argument is that the income tax is unconstitutional as a mandatory

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Th &quot;...promote the general welfare...&quot; clause covers all that, I believe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Besides, who says the constitution is all that great, anyway. We need to

<em>&gt; &gt; change it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Doesn't anybody actually *read* the Constitution before giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions about it? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;          Amendment XVI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The income tax, even as a mandatory system, is definitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitutional.  The only wiggle room I can conceive of would be to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find a constitutional quarrel with the exact manner in which the tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is imposed.  It seems from the article cited that there are some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who have some legal quarrel with the income tax regime, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they make their case not on the constitution but on the tax code.  My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess is that no court will accept their argument.
</em><br>
<p>Arguments are many and various. There has been significant contention
<br>
about whether the sixteenth amendment was ever properly ratified.
<br>
Something to do with the number of states that ratified it in a given
<br>
time period versus the number of states in the Union at the time the
<br>
last state that ratified it in the specified time period did so. As
<br>
states are added to the union, the number required for ratification of
<br>
any outstanding amendments goes up. If it was not properly ratified,
<br>
then we fall back to the consitutional principle that the federal
<br>
government can only impose indirect taxes, while only the states can
<br>
impose direct taxes like income taxes.
<br>
<p>Another item of debate is what the true definiton of 'income' is (or
<br>
what it was at the time this amendment was written) versus what the
<br>
government bureaucrats would like it to be. They ARE notorious for
<br>
redefining things to suit their goals. There are arguments that 'income'
<br>
as specified at the time of the 16th amendment only applies to revenue
<br>
from things like bonds, stock dividends, pensions, and other securities
<br>
related income. Direct remuneration for labor by individuals is
<br>
supposedly not considered 'income' under these legal theories.
<br>
<p>Also a matter of debate (which does not violate the amendment if it is
<br>
in fact properly ratified) are actual loopholes in the law (as is
<br>
asserted by the referenced story) that exempt large numbers of people
<br>
and businesses from paying any income taxes. If that is indeed what the
<br>
law says (as dictated by congress, as the 16th amendment requires) then
<br>
those people do not, in fact, have to pay the tax if it does not apply
<br>
to them under congressionally passed tax law (which congress can change
<br>
as it sees fit, but the IRS cannot by itself).
<br>
<p>There are arguments that the IRS tax code itself states that income tax
<br>
is voluntary for most people. Where they get you is that most all
<br>
government programs that involve some sort of payment of money or
<br>
services to individuals from the government involve a contract clause
<br>
where the individual agrees to comply with the section of the tax code
<br>
that specifies them volunteering to pay income tax. Even having a bank
<br>
account at a federally insured financial institution 'volunteers' you
<br>
for the income tax (because that federal deposit insurance makes you a
<br>
federal beneficiary), and it is in your account agreement.
<br>
<p>I happen to know an author here in New Hampshire who has not paid income
<br>
taxes for 20 years, and belongs to a Tax Patriot protest group.
<br>
Membership fees entitle you to fully paid representation AND
<br>
compensation for all confiscated property in the event that a member is
<br>
successfully prosecuted by the IRS. They have somthing like 50,000
<br>
members, and claim zero successfull prosecutions by the IRS.
