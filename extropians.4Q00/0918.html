<br>
<p>Chuck,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all respect to you; can't you figure this one out?  Look at the 
<br>
average Anti-gun zealots mail.  It is full of data, carefully framed 
<br>
quotations of how their leaders only want to save lives not ban guns and even 
<br>
reveal that they have excellent sites that will give you the full story 
<br>
against guns.  This is a well financed and orchestrated campaign to get all 
<br>
guns out of the country.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of that campaign they demonize Lott, the NRA and anyone else that 
<br>
opposes them.  I especially enjoy the hoops they jump through trying to 
<br>
explain away our constitutional right to bear arms.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't shoot or belong to the NRA and I mostly watch this debate from my 
<br>
lurking position in the corner of the room but truly the anti gun zealots are 
<br>
easy to see through.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is their goal?  A country, possibly a world, where only they or 
<br>
people they approve of have guns.  Why would I say that?  Again just watch; 
<br>
then tell me the next time you see one of the zealot's leaders without an 
<br>
armed guard.  Please, if you ever see one send me an email.  I'll mark it in 
<br>
my journal as worthy of remembrance.
<br>
Ron h.
