I have thought about this idea many times over the years, and will be interested
<br>
to see how they got around the basic problems.  Yes, it is possible to store
<br>
that much energy in a tank, and yes you can design a gas expansion engine to run
<br>
a car (however, there is no way the $0.30 US for 200 km can be true).  The
<br>
problems come from the basic thermodynamics of the Carnot cycle.  When you
<br>
compress the air, it gets very hot, and as that heat is lost into the
<br>
environment, you loose energy storage efficiency.  When you expand the air in
<br>
the cylinders, it cools down below ambient absorbing heat from the environment.
<br>
If you try to run one of these where it is very cold outside, the engine temp
<br>
drops so low you get terrible efficiency, and it might freeze up on you
<br>
(literally).
<br>
<p>If you are going to operate this in a hot climate, and you do not care about the
<br>
storage loss, it is probably as good as that which can be done with electric
<br>
batteries today.  An idea I had long ago was to use the space shuttle ceramic
<br>
tile insulation material to make compressed air tanks that remained at high
<br>
temperature.  This way the air that goes to the engine is still hot, has not
<br>
lost so much of that energy, and then comes out of the engine warm.  You can
<br>
operate it in snow and still have a heater.  A major drawback is the idea of
<br>
carrying around hot tanks stressed at 300 to 500 atm.
<br>
<p>Back before the first human powered aircraft flight, I had a related idea.  This
<br>
was a human powered aircraft in which compressed air was used to overcome the
<br>
power requirements for takeoff.  The basic idea was to have the human sit on the
<br>
ground for a few hours before the flight peddling a compressor that was charging
<br>
the tank.  At takeoff time, those hours of human 0.2 hp goes into the expansion
<br>
engine to produce a couple of minutes approaching 100 hp (the Wright brothers
<br>
got off the ground in 1903 with 12 hp).  This would be a cool bird to fly in
<br>
hops across the country for fun, but it is in the list of projects I know I am
<br>
not going to get around to.
<br>
<p>Back at cars, all of the above is cute, but fuel cell designs will win soon and
<br>
then evolve as we get to nanotech.
