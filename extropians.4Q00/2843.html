Two of my heroes are Larry Flynt and Dr. Kevorkian. Both of them treat 
<br>
absurd laws (against obscenity, and against ownership of your own life) with 
<br>
open defiance. I'd like to ultimately see government whither, by the method 
<br>
of people just not taking it seriously. This happens once in a while but the 
<br>
people who do it usually end up suffering. In Flynt's case, he got away with 
<br>
it, though fairly bruised. Kevorkian, currently in prison, doesn't seem to 
<br>
be getting away with it. I hope these two are the Galileos of a trend which 
<br>
will ultimately cause the government to whither down to the size that the 
<br>
Catholic Church has. You'll know it's a serious trend when you see large 
<br>
corporations openly ignoring violations of their freedom. Here are two 
<br>
things I've read which make me think, and hope, that this is starting to 
<br>
happen.
<br>

This is an article about how several companies are refusing to take income 
<br>
tax, social security, and medicaire deductions from their employees' 
<br>
paychecks. They are also refusing to report their employees' incomes to the 
<br>
IRS. So far, they all seem to have gotten away with it, according to this 
<br>
article. My favorite parts of the article:
<br>
&quot;How many businesses are taunting the I.R.S. this way is impossible to know. 
<br>
At least 23... have made their decisions public. Sixty business owners and 
<br>
their advisers met on the weekend of Nov. 11 in California to plan how to 
<br>
persuade thousands of others to join them.&quot;
<br>
And this quote from a former IRS commissioner: &quot;This is tremendously 
<br>
significant because we have never before had responsible parties — employers 
<br>
— refuse to withhold.. The system simply cannot work if they get away with 
<br>
this.&quot;
<br>

Another thing I've been impressed with is the French ruling on Yahoo 
<br>
auctions selling Nazi war items. Everyone seems to think this is so terrible 
<br>
and sets an awful precedent, but I think it's great, because Yahoo will not 
<br>
pay the fines, and it will expose government as impotent when attempting to 
<br>
act outside its jurisdiction. Hopefully this will lead to offshore-type 
<br>
thinking and ventures.
<br>
&quot;A Yahoo attorney, Greg Wrenn, contended that France had no jurisdiction in 
<br>
the case... He said Yahoo, the world's most popular Internet portal, would 
<br>
refuse to pay the fines. &quot;
<br>
I only wish they were a little more brazen - like putting up something on 
<br>
their site saying &quot;We are fining the French government $130,000 per day 
<br>
until they stop being assholes&quot;, with an applet counting up the fine. The 
<br>
best that could come out of this case would be if a US court ordered them to 
<br>
pay the fines, they refused, and got away with it. [on a side note, every 
<br>
article on this seems to suggest it's Nazis who are buying and selling this 
<br>
stuff. I'm sure some of them are Nazis, but if you have a grandparent or 
<br>
uncle who served in WWII, you know this is not usually the case].
