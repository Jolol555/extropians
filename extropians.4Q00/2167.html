<p>&lt;&lt; I always thought that the age of immortality would be
<br>
an age of greater morality on a person's part- whether
<br>
or not religion existed.  I think that the value of an
<br>
individual life goes way up when it's potential is
<br>
suddenly rendered near-limitless.  Morality as in
<br>
respect for one another, I suppose, would be the best
<br>
definition of what I'm referring to, not in any
<br>
religious sense.  I'm nonreligious myself but do
<br>
consider myself to be a &quot;moral&quot; person as defined by
<br>
Webster's revised unabridged dictionary, '96 (def 2)-
<br>
&quot;Teaching or exhibiting goodness or badness of
<br>
character and behavior&quot;.  &lt;&lt;
<br>
This is demonstrated in nature, too- creatures with
<br>
short lifespans tend to reproduce faster, die out more
<br>
easily, and exhibit less care for each other (though
<br>
this may be because fast reproduction is a fairly
<br>
succesfull, simple strategy, which has bootstrapped
<br>
early species into the modern era without the need of
<br>
life sustaining specializations), but in general
<br>
something resembling this tends to be the case. 
<br>
Animals which live longer tend to be more social in
<br>
many ways, or at least care for each other more-
<br>
elephants come back and visit the graves of their dead
<br>
at times, and are known to be able to recognize which
<br>
ones are theirs, though I've not heard this massively
<br>
well-backed up.&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Well put. I also think morality/ethics tend to grow as per capita prosperity 
<br>
grows. David Brin (among others) has pointed out in several essays that our 
<br>
perception of &quot;we&quot; (as in &quot;us vs them&quot;) has been increasing greatly in recent 
<br>
years -- as the struggle for survival becomes less grim, we tend to become 
<br>
more inclusive, admitting not only human beings but even animals and (one 
<br>
would hope) artificial life as well. I always found the idea that humans 
<br>
would become jaded and struck by ennui if they lived too long to be utterly 
<br>
ridiculous. I think that we would become far wiser and more generous once 
<br>
survival is not longer a central concern.
<br>
<p>CJC
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; Ants tend to reproduce like crazy and
</em><br>
die off just as fast- warring, cannibalizing, throwing
<br>
out the ones of their own that smell like the dead-
<br>
these are all examples of primitive wiring, to be
<br>
sure, but wiring that would be modified if there were
<br>
not so many individual units to go around.
<br>
You all assumedly know this, I was just trying to be
<br>
clear in what I was talking about.
