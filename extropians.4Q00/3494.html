<p><em>&gt; Working in Vermont as I do, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the current Civil Union controversy raging, it has turned out that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the overt 'hate' crimes committed here since the 'Take Back Vermont'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grassroots campaign began were actually committed by gays trying to gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sympathy.
</em><br>
<p>Please provide referrences proving your contention that all (overt?) hate
<br>
crimes commited in the state of Vermont in the period in question were
<br>
actually commited by gays.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Sorry Harvey, I just don't accept claims of widespread rural bigotry at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the level you claim, except possibly in the rural South or other areas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of strong Klan influence
</em><br>
<p>I'm not certain what level of rural bigotry Harvey was claiming, but rural
<br>
bigotry is generally considered a more insidious problem for several
<br>
reasons.  Large population centers tend to support greater
<br>
cultural/orientational diversity.  Incidents are often under reported in
<br>
rural areas, due to denial for instance (see your post above.)
<br>
<p>A few quotes from the U.S. Department of Justice Policymaker's Guide to Hate
<br>
Crimes:  (<a href="http://www.texasnaacp.org/hateguid.htm#1">http://www.texasnaacp.org/hateguid.htm#1</a>)
<br>
<p><p>&quot;It's alarming that a number of communities reporting said that no hate
<br>
crimes were committed within their jurisdictions,&quot; said Stephen Arent, vice
<br>
chairman of the ADL's National Civil Rights Committee. &quot;Unfortunately there
<br>
is a great deal of denial. Many communities would say that hate crimes don't
<br>
exist.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;In certain communities, especially urban communities such as Washington,
<br>
D.C., and San Francisco, people do feel more comfortable coming out&quot; than
<br>
they would have felt a few years ago, Gonzales said. &quot;As you move to rural
<br>
areas and the center of the country, the comfort level with coming out is
<br>
not as great, and those are the areas where gays and lesbians will be less
<br>
likely to report hate crimes.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Given the incendiary nature of hate crimes, some State and local political
<br>
leaders and law enforcement officials discourage police and sheriff's
<br>
departments from collecting or disseminating raw data. They consider any
<br>
evidence of hate crimes a &quot;black eye&quot; on their community and fear the
<br>
possible economic and political repercussions.&quot;
<br>
<p>While the problem of victim underreporting is particularly significant in
<br>
the gay and lesbian community, the stigma of &quot;coming out&quot; has lessened in
<br>
recent years. High-profile declarations by entertainment, sports, and
<br>
political figures such as k.d. lang, Elton John, Martina Navratilova, and
<br>
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Massachusetts), point toward a growing acceptance and
<br>
tolerance of the gay lifestyle. The reality, however, still is quite
<br>
different, Gonzales said. Recent incidents of violence against gays in
<br>
Colorado, Oregon, and Maine, among other States, underscore the assertion
<br>
that, in many areas, gays &quot;have the appearance of equality but not the fact
<br>
of equality.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Many police jurisdictions, especially those in rural areas, simply do not
<br>
have the manpower, inclination, or technical expertise to record hate
<br>
crimes, and other jurisdictions fear that admitting the existence of hate
<br>
crimes will cause their communities cultural, political, and economic
<br>
repercussions.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Victims have a myriad of reasons for failing to report hate crimes.
<br>
Homosexual victims may decide not to report hate crimes to police because of
<br>
fears of reprisals or a belief that they will be forced &quot;out of the closet.&quot;
<br>
Such an &quot;outing&quot; may cause repercussions to their career and relationships
<br>
with family and friends.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Please note that although under reporting is considered a major problem,
<br>
there are very likely jurisdictions that engage in what I would call
<br>
over-reporting as well:
<br>
<p>&quot;For various reasons many victims do not report hate crimes, and public
<br>
service organizations and police agencies report hate crimes differently.
<br>
Depending on the jurisdiction, local law enforcement may only record and
<br>
report bias-motivated &quot;crimes&quot; -- those incidents that have been reported,
<br>
investigated, and categorized as hate crimes. Some advocacy groups, on the
<br>
other hand, classify all bias-motivated &quot;incidents&quot; as hate crimes, whether
<br>
or not they rise to the level of criminal offense.&quot;
