<p><em>&gt; I want to thank Harvey Newstrom for clarifying Al Gore's role in the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; wondered quite skeptically at this overblown attribution.  Now I find that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he in fact did have a substantial role.  That, combined with his interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in nanotech as evidenced by his interview of Drexler--Senate committee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing, as I recall--tends to confirm the impression I had of him as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward-thinking tech-savvy kind of guy.  
</em><br>
<p>Sometimes it is better not to have tech-savvy leaders.
<br>
<p>Here in Sweden, when Carl Bildt (moderate) was prime minister in the
<br>
early 90's he was quite pro information technology, and in fact one of
<br>
the early adopters. When he lost to Ingvar Carlsson (social democrat)
<br>
the social democrats deliberately ignored information technology
<br>
questions for quite some time - they were apparently a right-wing
<br>
issue, and hence not worth spending time on. This happens a lot in
<br>
Swedish politics.
<br>
<p>Imagine what would have happened if a tech-savvy person like Bildt had
<br>
been in power during the initial &quot;discovery&quot; of the Internet in
<br>
93-95. Most likely he would have been very much for extending it - but
<br>
under government control or at least influence (less control than the
<br>
social democrats, of course, but still plenty of control). Had Ingvar
<br>
Carlsson been aware of it, he would likely have instituted even more
<br>
control. Instead we got far too little government interference far too
<br>
late, which I consider a very good thing. Now it has a much harder
<br>
time regulating it or influencing its structure.
