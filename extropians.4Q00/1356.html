</em><br>
<p>There are some compelling reasons to go this route.  My favorite is
<br>
the safety aspect: it would be possible to send the prefab stuff ahead,
<br>
before the human cargo is launched.  Then see how much of it survives
<br>
the landing.  After an inventory is taken of what equipment survived,
<br>
a decision could be made on sending perishable human cargo.  I like
<br>
the idea of a 1-2 year intermediate stay on Phobos, perhaps even
<br>
splitting a 2 person crew with the other going to Deimos, in order to
<br>
have more contact with base camp.
<br>
<p>If the machines turn out to be successful in building a habitable
<br>
base camp, the human cargo would climb into a small descent
<br>
module and go move in.  If  the effort is unsuccessful, this sceme
<br>
maintains the option of returning to the home planet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Assuming it's not more cost-effective to work as hard as possible on nano
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; railgun. Damien Broderick
</em><br>
<p>Roger that, but Im one of those cursed heretics that believes strong nano
<br>
is still 20 yrs out.  There is *plenty* of time to build a Mars base before
<br>
then, if we get with it.  And I would *suuure* like to see a Mars base
<br>
*before* we get either nanotech or strong AI.  spike
