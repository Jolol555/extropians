<p><em>&gt; I believe that I may no longer be a member of the ExI.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reason I am not sure is that there is no difference between being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a member and not being a member -- except that it costs more to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a member, of course.
</em><br>
<p>I dropped off the original Extropy mailing list when they started
<br>
to charge for it, because I was young and somewhat foolish, and had
<br>
alot of things to learn.
<br>
<p>As soon as I had learned those lessons I was back because I
<br>
realized how valuble this list and the Extropy Institute really is.
<br>
I also learned the important lesson that these things cost money.
<br>
<p>Please stay on the list. While the list isn't free (TANSTAFFL),
<br>
many of us will continue to support it. 
<br>
<p>Renewal is the sincerest form of flattery, and I not only just
<br>
renewed (thanks E Shaun Russell) but upped my membership to
<br>
sustaining.
