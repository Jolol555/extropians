<p><em>&gt; Sure, if you can show us how to sustainably strip Darwin, big boy. So

<em>&gt; all you have is to prove that imperfect replication in face of limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources is not always applicable, or that there is a higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle granting higher fitness while not utilizing above means.
</em><br>
<p>I guess the only way for Homo sapiens to prove there is a higher prinicple is
<br>
for Homo sapiens to survive the confrontational holocaust it has prepared for
<br>
itself with weapons of mass destruction. If I had to give a name to that higher
<br>
principle, perhaps I'd call it what others have dubbed transhumanism.
<br>
Transhumanism grants  transhumans higher fitness by making them exempt from
<br>
confrontation while not utilizing confrontational means. E. O. Wilson calls this
<br>
&quot;exemptionalism&quot; but he also uses the word &quot;consilience&quot; to refer to the
<br>
convergence of all scientific fields into a single consistent science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This needs to know the total shape of the fitness function en detail,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including the current state of the population and ability to adjust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster than the system as a whole can adapt. In case you're wondering,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this spells out effective 1) omniscience 2) omnipresence 3) omnipotence
</em><br>
<p>If the species immune system corresponds to warfare, then omni-doo-dah
<br>
correlates to avoidance of disease vectors. Soldiers don't need to understand
<br>
foreign policy to do their jobs, and heads of state don't need to understand the
<br>
theory of everything in order to avoid war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A God could homestead a whole universe that way, provided it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to, a god could do that for a small pocket of reality (assuming,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would want to), for a while (until a bigger god would come, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dislodge him). So all you have to show how less than godlike beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can create a god with above properties, where we're right at Eliezer's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dilemma. Last time I looked they didn't offer Certified God Engineer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degrees over there in Redmond (on second thought, these folks would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably in charge of the nether regions).
</em><br>
<p>For all we know, Homo sapiens are destined to become gods in the same
<br>
evolutionary way that apes have been destined to become Homo sapiens. Since we
<br>
haven't yet become gods, we can't know what a god would homestead, or would want
<br>
to homestead. Eliezer's dilemma is the human dilemma writ small.
<br>
We'll either transcend the species' immune system paradigm, or we'll kill
<br>
ourselves trying.
<br>
So it seems to me on Thursday morn.
<br>
