<p>Some local reports are saying that crumpled, smeared and torn ballots were
<br>
not run through the computers the first time.  It was only during the
<br>
recount that they are being manually entered if the machines wouldn't read
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>Another reported source of votes is write-in votes.  Apparently, no one
<br>
counted write-in votes because 95% of ballots had punched a pre-printed
<br>
candidate (meaning that no write-ins could win anyway).  During the recount,
<br>
they are actually counting write-ins for Bush and Gore which add more votes
<br>
that were not counted the first time.
<br>
<p>I am concerned at how inaccurate the vote was until we started the recount.
<br>
It is disturbing that a careful recount should take so much longer than the
<br>
first count, and should come up with different numbers.  We need a margin of
<br>
error on elections.  Who will believe Bush really won by exactly 229 votes
<br>
when there are so many more errors than that.  We really don't have any idea
<br>
who won this election!
