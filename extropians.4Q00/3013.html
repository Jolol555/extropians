<em>&gt; &gt; Can tethers have a complete orbit?  For example, from an orbit could a

<em>&gt; &gt; satellite have a cable that reached all the way around the planet back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; itself?  That might be a first stage about putting a structure around the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entire planet.  If a couple cables were in orbit, they could generate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deionizing fields around the planet outside of it's magnetosphere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think there are problems with stability in such a structure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've read that if you had a *rigid* ring, it could not be in orbit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One side or the other would tend to drift downwards.  It wouldn't make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any difference if it were rotating or not.  Of course this is only for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an idealized, perfectly rigid ring, and no solid materials could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly rigid at the size scale we are talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For a flexible ring, I think the problem is that if the orbit is slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elliptical, as any true orbit will be, the particles of the ring want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; move faster during the lower part of the orbit.  This will compress the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ring in some portions and stretch it elsewhere.  I suspect that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy transfer will cause the ring to become deformed and to collapse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the atmosphere eventually.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You could possibly fix these problems with active elements, little rockets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or perhaps solar mirrors to monitor the position of each ring element
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and herd it back into the desired configuration.  But this would add
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatly to the complexity of an already difficult project.  25000 miles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of cable of any practical thickness is going to be a mighty big spool.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also I'm skeptical of this &quot;deionizing fields&quot; concept, because a cable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving parallel to it own length won't cut any magnetic field lines and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so won't generate any significant currents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hal
</em><br>
<p>That's why there would be two.  If one is in orbit and the the other one floats
<br>
over and beneath the poles, I thought that would have to do with field.  If a
<br>
field could be established, then it could deionize incoming solar mass, for
<br>
example. So one equatorial and the other polar.  If that worked, you could make
<br>
more.
<br>
<p>If there are ways to store and reuse kinetic energy, then torsion could be
<br>
smoothed out of the flexible orbital ring.  Maybe it could be magnetically
<br>
connected at joints.
<br>
<p>Maybe it is better to try it on other planets and planetoids, extraterrestrial
<br>
construction.
