<p><p>&nbsp;------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;While too late to do this election, I would propose the following
</em><br>
as the foundation of a &quot;Futurist's Voter's Guide&quot;, so that at
<br>
the very least these issues are on the table.&lt;
<br>
<p>I scratch my head and wonder why these types of questions were
<br>
not presented somewhere - somehow - to any and all candidates.
<br>
&nbsp;These questions are timely, necessary and, without pause, essential
<br>
to our culture and our future.  
<br>
<p>While role-playing how the candidates might answer these questions,
<br>
I laughed in frustration while thinking of Sunday evening's primetime
<br>
&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; comic sketch on the election.
<br>
<p>Today I had a tele-conference with Michael Rose (Dept of Ecology
<br>
and Evolutionary Biology at UC Irvine).  We discussed the issues
<br>
and differences our culture is on the precipice of.  He talked
<br>
to me about how the &quot;economy&quot; had been the key ideological challenge
<br>
and fight around the 18th Century - which lasted a few hundred
<br>
years between three separate schools of though: the socialists,
<br>
the conservatives, and the capitalists.  We discussed how we
<br>
today are in the beginning midst of a 21st century ideological
<br>
challenge between three different schools of thought (to be discussed
<br>
later).  But it's not the economy at issue but our physical &quot;body&quot;
<br>
and how it can and will change and who will want the changes,
<br>
who will fight the changes.
<br>
<p>It might be a good idea to get your &quot;Futurist's Voter's Guide&quot;
<br>
published for the next round.
<br>
<p>Natasha
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>The proposal is this:  How do the candidates answer the following
<br>
questions:
<br>
<p>1) What is your vision of America's place in space in 20 years,
<br>
particularly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the civilian sector?
<br>
<p>2) If you had to choose one of the following to come true during
<br>
your 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;administration, what would it be and why?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) A breakthrogh in life extension technology adding at least
<br>
50% to the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lifespan of the average American (to 120 years old)?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The establishment of the first permanent civilian habitation
<br>
in space?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) The ability to replace failing organs with new ones grown
<br>
from a culture
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of that person's own cells?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) A zero-emissions transportation network that costs about
<br>
as much as the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;average family car today, per person?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) The ability to cure all genetic diseases through use of
<br>
genetic 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engineering technology?
<br>
<p>3) In your opinion, what was the most significant scientific
<br>
achievement
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since 1950, and the impact it has had on you personally, on
<br>
the nation,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on the world as a whole.
<br>
<p>4) Based on your answer to number 3, what technology could you
<br>
imagine that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would have as far-reaching effect, if not moreso, and what
<br>
you would do
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to make it a reality.
<br>
<p>5) Longevity has been increasing at a surprising rate - 50% over
<br>
the 20th 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;century, and is increasing at a growing rate.  Fundamentally,
<br>
what it means
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to grow old in the modern world is changing dramatically.
<br>
&nbsp;What policies 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would you enact/rescind/modify to deal with this growing change
<br>
in 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;social demographics and its corresponding effects on all our
<br>
lives?
<br>
<p>6) Suppose that sometime during your presidency, proof positive
<br>
was shown 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we had created a truly artificial intelligence.  How
<br>
would you handle
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the questions that spring from this breakthrough, including
<br>
such issues as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;citizenship and &quot;human rights&quot; questions, as well as the ethics
<br>
of dealing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with this sort of a being.
<br>
<p>&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;
<br>
<p>While this is in no way exhaustive, it is an attempt to offer
<br>
a starting
<br>
point.  The goal is to assess the candidate's positions on futurist
<br>
<p>causes, and not their adherence to a particular political or
<br>
social 
<br>
ideology; their party affiliation should tell more about that
<br>
than this 
<br>
questionaire should ask.
<br>
<p>Any additions of quesions, etc.?  Maybe by the time of the next
<br>
major 
<br>
elections in the US (two years hence - senate and all house races),
<br>
this 
<br>
questionaire can help us get a better view of how these people
<br>
will pursue 
<br>
the policies we hold dear.
