<p>Finally someone offers at least a sensible objection to Hudson's claims.
<br>
Hudson calls his white powder of gold an &quot;invention&quot; but I don't see any mention
<br>
of any patents pending. Do you?
<br>
He describes his &quot;invention&quot; thus:
<br>
<a href="http://monatomic.earth.com/david-hudson/patent-oz.html">http://monatomic.earth.com/david-hudson/patent-oz.html</a>
<br>
1. In a separated and substantially pure, stable form, a non-metallic, orbitally
<br>
rearranged monoatomic transition or noble metal element selected from the group
<br>
consisting of cobalt, nickel, copper, silver, gold, palladium, platinum,
<br>
ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, and osmium having a d orbital hole sharing energy
<br>
with an electron or electrons, said shared energy identified as a doublet in an
<br>
infrared spectrum of from between about 1400 and 1600-1 cm.
<br>
<p><p>2. The orbitally rearranged monoatomic element of claim 1 wherein said element
<br>
is gold.
<br>
<p><p>3. The orbitally rearranged monoatomic element of claim 1 wherein said element
<br>
is silver.
<br>
<p><p>4. The orbitally rearranged monoatomic element of claim 1 wherein said element
<br>
is copper.
<br>
<p><p>5. The orbitally rearranged monoatomic element of claim 1 wherein said element
<br>
is palladium.
<br>
<p><p>6. The orbitally rearranged monoatomic element of claim 1 wherein said element
<br>
is platinum.
<br>
<p><p>7. The orbitally rearranged monoatomic element of claim 1 wherein said element
<br>
is ruthenium.
<br>
<p><p>8. The orbitally rearranged monoatomic element of claim 1 wherein said element
<br>
is rhodium.
<br>
<p><p>9. The orbitally rearranged monoatomic element of claim 1 wherein said element
<br>
is iridium.
<br>
<p><p>10. The orbitally rearranged monoatomic element of claim 1 wherein said element
<br>
is osmium.
<br>
<p><p>11. The orbitally rearranged monoatomic element of claim 1 wherein said element
<br>
is cobalt.
<br>
<p><p>12. The orbitally rearranged monoatomic element of claim 1 wherein said element
<br>
is nickel.
<br>
<p><p>13. Process of forming a non-metallic, orbitally rearranged monoatomic form of
<br>
an element selected from the group consisting of cobalt, nickel, copper, silver,
<br>
gold, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, and osmium from the
<br>
corresponding element in metal form comprising treating said metal form by
<br>
forming a salt thereof, exhaustively solubilizing and evaporating said salt in
<br>
an aqueous medium until a diatom of said metal form is obtained; and thereafter
<br>
treating said diatom with an alkali metal in the presence of water to form said
<br>
orbitally rearranged, stable monoatomic form of said element.
<br>
<p><p>14. Process of forming a metal selected from the group consisting of cobalt,
<br>
nickel, copper, silver, gold, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium,
<br>
and osmium from a material having the corresponding element present in a
<br>
non-metallic, orbitally rearranged monoatomic stable form of said element,
<br>
comprising separating said element in said orbitally rearranged monoatomic form
<br>
from said material, and then subjecting said separated, non-metallic, orbitally
<br>
rearranged monoatomic stable form to a two-step negative potential of at least
<br>
1.8 to 2.2 V initially, and then to at least 2.5 V until the said element is
<br>
formed by electroplating techniques.
<br>
<p><p>15. Process of forming a metal selected from the group consisting of cobalt,
<br>
nickel, silver, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, and osmium
<br>
from a material having the corresponding element present in a non-metallic,
<br>
orbitally rearranged monoatomic stable form of said element, comprising
<br>
subjecting said element in said orbitally rearranged monoatomic stable form to a
<br>
treatment with nitric oxide at elevated temperatures.
<br>
<p><p>16. Process of treating the stable non-metallic, orbitally rearranged monoatomic
<br>
transition or noble metal element of claim 1 by subjecting said element to
<br>
alternate heating and cooling cycles under an inert gas and supplying an
<br>
external magnetic field to said element until said element no longer exhibits a
<br>
doublet in the infrared spectrum and exhibits magnetic flux exclusion at
<br>
temperatures above 200K.
<br>
<p><p>17. The product formed by the process of claim 16.

<p>[President Clinton] boasts about 186,000 people denied firearms under the Brady
<br>
Law rules. The Brady Law has been in force for three years. In that time, they
<br>
have prosecuted seven people and put three of them in prison. You know, the
<br>
President has entertained more felons than that at fundraising coffees in the
<br>
White House, for Pete's sake.&quot;
