<p>I imagine people will still go to the cinema, which would be
<br>
rather easy to regulate.  And then there's merchandising.
<br>
So you're really only talking about the loss of video sales.
<br>
Even then you can add interactive elements, stream the
<br>
content, and the resulting non-linearity should make capture
<br>
more difficult.  (This is why software is safe: if you
<br>
stream software, which you should, it's almost impossible to
<br>
capture.  This is obvious to see in videogames, where you
<br>
can stream in geometry, textures, etc, according to game
<br>
state.  Trying to grab all the data is not an easy task and
<br>
can be made much more difficult, perhaps impossible, by
<br>
design.)  I also think that if the payment scheme is simple
<br>
enough the majority of people are going to download from the
<br>
official site rather than use P2P software, especially if
<br>
the publishers realise that the experience of the movie (or
<br>
book, or song) begins before the purchase.  (And if movie,
<br>
music, and book publishers start offering small fees for
<br>
referrals you can also expect official, paying links to be
<br>
as prevalent as banner ads for porn.)
