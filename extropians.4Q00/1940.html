<em>&gt; &gt; Mike, I am certainly no fan of the FDA, but I think I have to side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on this one.  The food in question is engineered to produce its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pesticide.  This new corn is not chemically equivalent to natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; corn, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is chemically equivalent to natural corn plus pesticide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given that toxins tend to concentrate in urine, milk, and fat I wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to drink milk or eat meat from animals that had been fed this corn,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nor would I want to use manure from these animals on my garden.
</em><br>
<p>This is a bit strange considering that you are already consume animal
<br>
based products from animals fed foods quite saturated with pesticides. 
<br>
The point of modifying a plant genetically to produce its own pesticide
<br>
is that it produces just enough (and if possible of a happier chemical)
<br>
for its needs.  This results in much lower concentration of pesticides
<br>
than non-genetic means like spraying crops.  The latter is a shotgun
<br>
approach and likely to result in much higher health risks and accidental
<br>
contamination of nearby lifeforms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've had the experience of using manure from horses who'd been fed hay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cut from pastures sprayed with 2,4-D. The herbicide residue in the manure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killed all my broad leaf plants. Even the county ag extension agent here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who was educated at a university which advocated the liberal use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pesticides in agriculture now questions whether it is, afterall, a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  Old style pesticide use is much more dangerous.  However, some
<br>
kind of pesticides must be used to have effective crop yields.  So you
<br>
do what is most controllable.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  I doubt that it's any worse to eat Starlink corn itself than it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to eat animals who'd been fed on it.
</em><br>
<p><p>Actually it should be much better to eat animals fed this corn and the
<br>
corn itself than corn that had been massively sprayed the old-fashioned
<br>
way.  The pesticide is in the plant but not necessarily as concentrated
<br>
in the actual corn.  But I would need to see studies on that idea.
