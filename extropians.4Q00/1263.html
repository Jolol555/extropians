</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or, at least, so I understand.
</em><br>
<p>Perzackly- this is why the old Titan II's are only being used by the
<br>
USAF for smallsat launches, and similarly with the Russian ICBM
<br>
launchers.  Also, the LEO payloads of these vehicles are poor since
<br>
their mission delta-V as designed was quite short of orbit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Besides, there's gotta be better ways than chemical fuels to achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbit.
</em><br>
<p>Not really- rockets are remarkably efficient heat engines _when used at
<br>
high mass ratios_.  The object in orbit can have kinetic energy over 50%
<br>
of the chemical energy in the tank on the pad.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Get the fuel to achieve orbit to under 10% of the rocket's mass,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that alone would probably get you cheap access to space, relative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today's costs.  (It'd probably be more due to reduced maintenance to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduced mass, than directly to reduced fuel costs, but cheaper is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheaper.)
</em><br>
<p>Nope, fuel is cheap, the entire design concept has to be revamped to
<br>
take the best advantage of that.  1000 tons of LOX/kerosene, plenty to
<br>
put 10 tons of payload into orbit in two stages, only costs about
<br>
$150,000- or $150/kg of payload.  Ammunition thinking, with severe
<br>
constraints on gross liftoff weight, is what gave us $5,000/kg
<br>
launchers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, what do rocket scientists call their not-as-tough-as-one-would-think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;It's the business plan, stupid.&quot;  The technology exists, the tough part
<br>
is making the right marketing decisions which then drive the design to
<br>
be economical rather than highest performance.
