<em>&gt; It isn't a question of resources, or intelligence, or foresight, or

<em>&gt; compassion.  It is a question of ability to coordinate and commit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider the analogy of firms trying to collude to raise prices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They each have a common interest in so colluding, but also a private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest in secretly violating the agreement and selling more at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lower price.  Even though firms are smart with great resources, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is their inability to coordinate and commit that typically drops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices to far below the collusive level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there is just one colonizing agency, then yes, they might assign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property rights to places to colonize, and take their time about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if some other &quot;sooners&quot; get out there too, and get out in front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the slower standard colonists, then there may not be much the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; official agency can do to stop them or punish them.  By the time the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colonist &quot;police&quot; arrive, the sooners are off to the next place.
</em><br>
<p>But what is the advantage, economically, to just build and go, build and go?
<br>
This presupposes that the overriding source of intrinsic value in interstellar
<br>
colonization is in going places, not in getting to places. I don't see this as
<br>
being realistic. Anyone with any curiosity is going to want to stop to smell the
<br>
roses, meet the natives, catch all the local diseases... This also presupposes
<br>
that any 'state' finds it more economical to go out and find sooners AND
<br>
transport them back to face justice, unless they are merely to be exterminated
<br>
as they are found. Since the source civilization sees no benefit in preventing
<br>
the diaspora after its started (indeed, dumping the restless and misfits beyond
<br>
the frontier has often been used as a stabilization technique for established
<br>
societies). Any colonist 'police' are only going to find those who are left
<br>
behind, while the real 'criminals' will always be yond the light cone of the
<br>
pursuers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The key technology that would make a difference would be an ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to project force out farther and faster than reproducing colonists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could move.  But it is hard to imagine such a technology.
</em><br>
<p>Yeehaw, bring on the Cavalry.
