From: &quot;Steve&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:steve@multisell.com?Subject=Re:%20greens&In-Reply-To=&lt;005901c05334$72cfce00$d2147318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">steve@multisell.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;Um, I don't care how high you want to climb up the rope of tautology here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Steve, the point remains.  Do you think that the act of stripping away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;limiting ideological garbage is itself, a limiting ideology?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; YES
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;If so, please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;explain your position in detail so the slow kids can keep up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because you have invented and are retaining this notion that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;limited&quot; ... which is what makes it so.
</em><br>
<p>Again, you're simply abstracting the issue one level.  Fine: the retention
<br>
of the notion of limitation IS the limitation.  THAT'S what we need to strip
<br>
away.  You wanna crawl up to the -next- level?  (No, no Jason, it's the
<br>
retention of the -belief- in the -notion- of limitation that is the
<br>
limitation, etc.)
<br>
<p>In any case, observationally your belief is clearly wrong-- or do you not
<br>
see millions of ongoing examples of individual humans falling prey to
<br>
limiting belief structures?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;2) Understand your personal power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or do you have power to hold back the waves?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;That too.  We humans are industrious little critters.  You can get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;surprisingly good results from a little bit of rebar and a pinch of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;concrete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, King Canute. I am just trying to inject a bit of perspective
</em><br>
(&quot;reality&quot;)
<br>
<em>&gt; into your slightly egomaniacal world view.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  I -do- have an ego (it's true) but in what fashion have you seen it
<br>
reflected unflatteringly in my previous post?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;3) Understand your environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And all of the other environments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Sure.  Of course, they have decreased relevancy to our existence if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;actually get to live in them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All environments are mental constructs .. sense data isn't direct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The world is located in consciousness&quot; (Kuhlenbeck).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our (E-1) brain generates a phantom median eye out of the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action potential/ neural information that carries generic sense-data ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is the ONLY explanation of consciousness that squares Leibnitz' Law.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  You're going to make me do this again, ain'tcha?  Okay...
<br>
Environments have decreased relevancy to our existence is we don't actually
<br>
get to &quot;mentally interface&quot; with them.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Others will disagree, but: reality is, after all, a game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You sound like a conventionalist, human-been philosophy student now ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;game&quot; is just a metaphor. Perhaps you should qualify by saying &quot;reality
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; LIKE a game&quot; ..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I would still disagree. Sure, a playful attitude is often a good thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though.
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't think you're getting what I'm getting at, but that's probably
<br>
because I haven't expended enough effort.  If you're persistent enough, you
<br>
might coax a moderate rant out of me on the subject.  There is a Lost Tribe
<br>
track called Gamemaster (used more famously by Mr. Paul Oakenfold,) that
<br>
points at the concept, but is (somewhat unfortunately) shrouded in some
<br>
mystical-druid-earth-goddess mumbo jumbo.
<br>
<p>I'm not directly referrencing some core truth of reality, but rather
<br>
remarking on an empowering means by which we might consider interfacing with
<br>
it.  I'm not talking Rocket Science (tm) here either-- simply: a) be aware
<br>
of how we are capable of interacting with reality, and b) take advantage of
<br>
it to optimise our existence.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;And what are you pretending to be now?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Post-human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) Bodhisattva (fully-enlightened being)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) Grandmaster Hodos Sphenodon (magus, games programmer)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) Steve Nichols (when have to visit the shops and pay my taxes)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By rehearsal and constant practice, we become more like the think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we pretend to be, but they are all &quot;thought-constructs&quot; still.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is just a case of finding our most accurate/ comfortable option.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All these roles are subject to change ... the point is we should aim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to become &quot;more than human.&quot; Immortality is earnt, not given.
</em><br>
<p>If &quot;pretending&quot; to be those things adds observable value to your existence,
<br>
and aids in achieving certain goals, then I say go for it.  (Premises which
<br>
are, perhaps, debatable.)
