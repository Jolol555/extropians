Ah! Brian, you have just experienced the awareness of the human and natural 
<br>
condition. The hope is that Intelligence will fix the problems that occur and 
<br>
perhaps, even repair those that have already happended.
<br>
This change is the nature of nature may take a very, very, long time. Or it 
<br>
may be merely a view centuries if the Singularitians have their way.
<br>
<p>The mending of the world is a task that will take many lifetimes, but that 
<br>
does not remove the responsibility from you. -Talmud

<p>&lt;&lt; Dear Fellow Extropians,
<br>
<p>I think we are all symbiotically linked... I was so fed up with work today, I 
<br>
wrote a LOOOONG email to myself ranting about so many things just mentioned 
<br>
in some of these e-mailsl! Just for kicks, I am sending you the unedited, 
<br>
highly tangled, stream of conciousness version (please excuse the format, I 
<br>
hope it is at least interesting and resonant)! Once I sort everything I was 
<br>
talking about into logical sections, maybe I will write a book or 
<br>
something... I don't want to look like any more of a lunatic than I already 
<br>
am!
<br>
<p>Peace and forward movement,

RAGE AGAINST BIOLOGY - PART 1
<br>
<p>WHY?!? EVERYTHING we do revolves around supporting this shell! I am not
<br>
saying that the human body is not an amazing and wonderful machine, but
<br>
GEEZ! The maintenance! Why do we work? To make money to support the
<br>
maintenance of our bodies so we don't DIE. Imagine how much more we could
<br>
accomplish if we did not have to sleep, (INSOMNIA IS A BLESSING to me) feed
<br>
ourselves, keep ourselves warm and dry, and generally maintain our bodily
<br>
health. Look at all the money that is there that can be used in so many
<br>
better ways! Housing, food, cosmetics, healthcare, and CRIPES! INSURANCE!
<br>
Nanotech is the solution. I wish my mind was able to consciously function
<br>
24/7. That is not to say that dreams are not important to me, because they
<br>
certainly are, but I just wish I could have them any time I wanted. Sure,
<br>
the advances we make in healthcare are going to enable us to live longer,
<br>
but I am waiting for the total solution. Maybe it will never come. Given the
<br>
way things are right now that will be a likely case. I am an optimist, but
<br>
the majority of people in the world are bound up by tradition, religious
<br>
dogma, stupidity, and lack of knowledge that is a MAJOR obstacle for the
<br>
really intelligent people to get the work they need to do done for the good
<br>
of humanity. How many wars are fought over property, religion, ideals that
<br>
cannot be justified using logic? Maybe it has to do with what is our purpose
<br>
here on earth? To me, what makes me is my thoughts and my mind, whatever
<br>
that might be definition-wise I leave that up to the experts. I want to work
<br>
on things that will directly help humanity get past this shell of biology,
<br>
but I am mired in the mundane every day. My mind cannot function fast enough
<br>
to absorb all the knowledge I want, and my fingers can't type fast enough to
<br>
get the ideas in my head out. There has got to be a faster way. I will be
<br>
first in line for a chip implant right into my brain. The more thinking
<br>
power I have at my disposal, the more interactions I can have with others,
<br>
the richer my life experience becomes. Sharing thoughts, ideas, experiences,
<br>
and the creative process are what I crave constantly. Sleep only impedes
<br>
that desire. Communications have come a long way but they are still
<br>
primative and open to many faults such as misinterpretation and interference
<br>
of all kinds. If the data was passed directly there would be far less
<br>
interpretation problems, let alone the increase in speed. You dont have to
<br>
worry about answering the phone or email being down because the
<br>
communication is in the very air we breathe moving the speed of light.
<br>
Taking the visions in my head and actually producing them in front of me,
<br>
without having to worry about the nuances of the interface to hinder me. A
<br>
thought processor/interpreter that can instantly produce the mind's vision
<br>
to the last detail, and modifying it at the speed of thought, with all the
<br>
corresponding technical details filled in just through the INTENT of the
<br>
user's thoughts. Hopefully, life does not get boring enough that we WANT to
<br>
die. Always serving the lowest common denominator. People like to feel
<br>
good. Drugs, food, sex. Its all a measure of how happy we are with our
<br>
lives. Time forces us to do things with a sense of urgency. It is our
<br>
biggest enemy versus biology. If we had unlimited time to do things, we could
<br>
experience everything... even experiencing multiple things at once. So one
<br>
can be lazy and also do computational physics at the same time, sort of like
<br>
a computer multitasking. That is assuming that the machines don't do the
<br>
hard thinking for us, which in that case I dont think that we will ever make
<br>
them powerful enough that human brains become &quot;obsolete&quot; in one sense of the
<br>
word (intuition, creative process, true creativity and ingenuity).
<br>
Development in paralell of human/machine interfaces will happen. New ways of 
<br>
interacting will become available. Biology is a prison. If we
<br>
weren't concerned with SURVIVAL any more, what would we do? Most humans
<br>
today would probably sit around and become couch potatoes, VR Junkies,
<br>
druggies, whatever. But what if we could channel all that extra energy into
<br>
something truly useful and great? Make our mark on the universe, so to
<br>
speak. Idle talk never gets anyone anywhere. Where are all the movers and
<br>
shakers? The really good stuff is yet to come, and it is going to take a
<br>
looong time for it to get realized. Maybe I am just impatient. All that
<br>
capital sitting out there in the hands of professional atheletes and
<br>
eccentric millionaires... why don't these people do something that will
<br>
directly affect their fellow human being's condition? Hell, someone like
<br>
Bill Gates could EASILY build and ship pre-fab housing to areas where
<br>
needed, and greenhouses, hydroponics, what4ever is needed, but NOOO he would
<br>
rather shell out 42 million for a custom built home. That makes me sick when
<br>
I hear about human suffering. If I had the money, you couldn't STOP me from
<br>
doing something! Show the friggin aborigenes and rain forest tribes what the
<br>
rest of the world is up to... break everyone out of this mystical belief
<br>
that &quot;god&quot; will make everything ok. That is such an irrational way of
<br>
looking at the world it makes me sick. Instead of taking your family to
<br>
church, how about doing something meaningful with them? Irrational fear of
<br>
death and hell has hampered FAR too many people in this world. It is time
<br>
for a real change. We do not live in the middle ages anymore. Instead of
<br>
having faith in something you can't see, have faith in people... the here
<br>
and now... hope... no... BELIEVE that the future will be bright and the
<br>
motivation to help make it that way. We need to embrace our knowledge and
<br>
discard the petty. Racisim, bigotry, hatred... we are all soooo far above
<br>
that. What is the point in it except to waste valueable and useful resources
<br>
(minds). We will never get there if we continue this self-destructive,
<br>
ignorant, stupid, childish behavior. The time for humanity to grow up is way
<br>
overdue. Our governments have as much to do with this as do each of us
<br>
individually. Look at the difference in military spending versus say,
<br>
humanitarian programs or space exploration. We are focussing on the WRONG
<br>
things! Why the hell can't McDonald's be part of the solutiion instead of
<br>
being one of the leaders in our nation's health problems! Once again, human
<br>
greed takes over. People prefer convenience over health. People live very
<br>
shortsighted lives. Most of us only focus on the here and now, our immediate
<br>
situation and environment. We are killing our own environment on the outside
<br>
and ouselves from the inside. Is it really so hard to use alternative energy
<br>
sources? AGAIN, the almighty buck rules. Oil companies and nations, auto
<br>
manufacturers, and others who rely heavily on petrochemicals have the world
<br>
in a self-destructive pattern. WHY IS THIS? WHY should we have to stand by
<br>
and watch us destroy ourselves? The human race needs an &quot;intervention&quot;, just
<br>
like a drug addict. We need a wake-up call before it is too late and we
<br>
can't go back. Fighting biology, destroying what we are is not the solution.
<br>
Finding the keys to how things work is part of the solution, but its
<br>
people's attitudes that are the hardest part to change. If everyone had a
<br>
bright view of what the future will be, a common vision, maybe it wouldn't
<br>
be so hard. But like I said before, people are self-centered. There is no
<br>
global human view. War is usually something we read about in the paper.
<br>
Everything is trivialized by the media. No wonder we can't agree on
<br>
anything! The truth about ourselves is too painful to face or too difficult
<br>
to see through all the spin. People don't listen to eachother. Moreover,
<br>
they can't filter out the real facts from their own feelings and individual
<br>
perceptions. How do we get to that common vision? I don't know. Maybe
<br>
science and philosophy has some good ideas about it. The closest I have seen
<br>
so far is the Transhumanists and Extropians. We need to switch from passive
<br>
to active mode. We need our voices heard and we need people to see the truth
<br>
about ourselves. We need to come together and drop all the bullshit and
<br>
actually DO something! At the very least, let's take care of our fellow
<br>
human beings by combining our resources and making a direct change of things
<br>
we see wrong in the world every day. I am all for free speech and
<br>
expression, but &quot;god dammit!&quot; enough is enough! Maybe we should just go
<br>
around and exterminate all the people we find repulsive (yeah right!). It's 
<br>
an extreme
<br>
view, and I do not condone it at all, but if there was a way to get rid of
<br>
the troublemakers, a way to show them the light of humanity and it's
<br>
potential, well then what are we waiting for? Stupid people shouldn't breed.
<br>
Don't have kids you can't afford just to get a welfare check. It brings us
<br>
all down. For most people everything I am saying is stating the obvious. But
<br>
then WHY are we so stuck? Sure technology is moving along at a blinding
<br>
pace. But what are we going to do with it all besides count our stacks of
<br>
greenbacks and fight over who has the patent on the human genome? Is the
<br>
human race doomed to bicker forever among itself? Hey, a little bit of
<br>
tension is a good thing of course, it helps stimulate ideas. But hell, let's
<br>
all at least get on the same page here! Do we REALLY need all those shades of
<br>
makeup? Do we REALLY need 2 million dollar SuperBowl commercials? Do we
<br>
REALLY need a 50,000 dollar SUV that only gets 15 miles per gallon when there 
<br>
are cars that will get 300? The worlds most basic and simple problems we 
<br>
STILL can't fix! WHY??? &quot;Feed the people... who don't have enough to eat, 
<br>
shoe the children... with no shoes on their feet, house the people living in 
<br>
the street, ohh there's a
<br>
solution.&quot;  - Steve Miller. 
<br>
<p>But I digress...
