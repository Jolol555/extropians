</em><br>

<p>1:
<br>
The luddite forces are further incensed by the &quot;horrors&quot; of nanotech,
<br>
genetic engineering, human modification and so on.  Eventually they
<br>
see/believe that only something like a &quot;cultural revolution&quot; will save
<br>
them and purge the scientists and techies.  The first natural or
<br>
artificial (more likely) plague that comes along wipes out humanity. 
<br>
Such could happen anyway but without scientists to combat it it would be
<br>
much more likely.
<br>
<p>2:
<br>
Like (1) but we (or rather they since most of us would be wiped out -
<br>
maybe in hiding) buy the farm through trying to return to the farm when
<br>
due to pollution, deterioration of top soil and so on that is no longer
<br>
viable and the amount of wildlife is too small to go all the way back to
<br>
hunter-gatherer ways.
