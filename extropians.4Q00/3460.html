<p>HUH?  Call me a simpleton but I thought Libertarianism was about people
<br>
doing it their way wherever that does not infringe on the rights of
<br>
others to do the same.  The above seems to assume that a lot of people's
<br>
legitimate interests are in conflict much of the time.

<p><em>&gt; From: Chris Russo &lt;<a href="mailto:extropy@russo.org?Subject=Re:%20Random%20comments%20on%20some%20late%20discussions.&In-Reply-To=&lt;3A2F38A3.72DFCD57@objectent.com&gt;">extropy@russo.org</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;And THIS is exactly why libertarians won't ever be a real force in American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;politics. Almost universally every libertarian I know (including me, most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;time) comes off as a self-righteous know-it-all, acting as though everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;is beneath them. We all seem to say &quot;If only they could see what we see,  but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;they're not bright enough, so we'll have to make them do it anyway.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Again, &quot;make them do it anyway&quot; is no part of what I thought
<br>
Libertarianism was about.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;You might want to reread my argument.  You're woefully misstating it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I proposed nowhere &quot;to make them do it anyway.&quot;  To the contrary, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;talked about coincidental goals building a coalition of voters.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;more cerebral voters will probably appreciate the strong logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;underlying everything, and the less cerebral will probably only be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;able to appreciate the shiny baubles that extend from that underlying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;logic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I'm basically saying to not turn away those voters just because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;don't understand the bigger picture.  I'm also saying that if we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;waiting for a plurality to understand the bigger picture, we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;doomed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The important thing is to actually have a bigger picture or have your
<br>
fundamental principles in order and be able to explain your positions in
<br>
terms of them.  The main parties have not dared mention or name their
<br>
fundamental principles for some time now.  There is a great emptiness in
<br>
American politics waiting to be filled.  
<br>
<p>It would be arrogant to say (not that anyone here has directly) that the
<br>
people are simply too dumb to be interested or to understand a platform
<br>
speaking of and build firmly on sound principles.  You will lose if you
<br>
try to compete in terms of sound-bytes and particular issue appeals
<br>
only.  You have at least of chance of making the issues clear if you
<br>
continuously bring it back to first principles.  You will probably still
<br>
lose mostly for now.  But you will have reached more people more deeply
<br>
and will have planted more seeds to be harvested later than otherwise.
