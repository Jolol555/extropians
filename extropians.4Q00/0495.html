<p><em>&gt; It concerns me whenever someone brings these things up (myself included). Such

</em><br>
dislike
<br>
<em>&gt; the idea that someone should be stripped of their rights and locked away just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because their MRI shows similarities to people who have committed certain
</em><br>
acts.
<br>
<p>Yes, that concerns me too, though we should remember that 95% of those in US
<br>
prisons are men. By chemically castrating male babies, as Feminazis have
<br>
recommended (doctors already mutilate male genitalia via circumcision, so just
<br>
extend the operation a bit further), society could curb crime and perhaps make
<br>
the work place less hostile toward females.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We DO, as a matter of fact, live in a society that presumes innocence (or at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least is supposed to). If society is going to impose such a violation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals privacy to 'protect' itself, it should also be required to protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the individual, from the alleged consequences of their alleged future alleged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acts, by offering GE treatment to eliminate such a defect, AND society should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume total liability for the consequences of such treatments, if it is going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to force them on people.
</em><br>
<p>No one has suggested compensating boys who had prepucectomies (removal of the
<br>
foreskin) against their will. So the practice of removing their testes (probably
<br>
not more painful) shortly after birth might not meet with much resistance
<br>
either. Or maybe a more politically correct alternative would be to simply
<br>
transgender boys sometime before puberty. That would also result in lower crime
<br>
rates. If the US were to vanguard such policies, it could soon become common
<br>
practice world wide. As for the reproductive side effects, a few hundred men
<br>
could provide enough sperm for in vitro fertilization of millions of fetuses.
<br>
Better yet, instead of milking a small population of studs for semen, fertility
<br>
clinics could simply use cloning, thereby bypassing the need for males
<br>
altogether. In short, to eliminate crime, all we need to do is eliminate males
<br>
(no &quot;profiling&quot; required).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any 'defect' that society claims is 'bad' ought to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a pretty damn large database of convincing evidence that 90-99.99% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individsuals with that defect will commit a violent crime before it is
</em><br>
permitted
<br>
<em>&gt; to be screened for and corrected.
</em><br>
<p>That fits perfectly with the profile of the US criminal, since 95% of them are
<br>
male. Eliminating the defect called masculinity would therefore almost
<br>
completely eliminate violent crime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That being said, such treatments should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done on a worldwide basis. I would not want to 'cure' all Americans of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential to kill, for example, when agressive countries like China, or muslim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations that breed terrorists, do not practice similar policies.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely right. We'd need to eliminate males world wide.
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>PS: Some list members may object to such a plan on the basis that 98% of men
<br>
never commit any violent crime. But, hey, better safe than sorry, right girls?

I wonder how many extropes will take this mockery seriously.
