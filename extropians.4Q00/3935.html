<em>&gt; &gt; I could do some research, but off the top of my head there was a case

<em>&gt; &gt; across the river in White River Junction, VT just a couple months ago
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where a black police officer was called n_____ by a drunk woman he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; arrested for D&amp;D. At the station he also pressed charges for a hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; crime, and won in court over her innocent plea. The woman insisted she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; never used such language when sober and did not conciously intend to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that epithet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sounds fair enough to me. Drugs/alcohol shouldn't get you out of social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility, especially when voluntarily self administered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Given that drugs like alcohol act to suppress the ego and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allow the id more liberties (i.e. reduces inhibitions) this is as close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to a thought crime as I think it is possible to go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; id? Isn't that a games development company? Why are you spouting Freud on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cusp of the 21st century?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really, it's not a thought crime at all. She really said it, the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person.
</em><br>
<p>If this is so, then why is court testimony under the influence of drugss
<br>
deemed inadmissible?
