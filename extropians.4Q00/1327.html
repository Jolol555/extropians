<em>&gt; Finally someone offers at least a sensible objection to Hudson's claims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hudson calls his white powder of gold an &quot;invention&quot; but I don't see any mention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of any patents pending. Do you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He describes his &quot;invention&quot; thus:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://monatomic.earth.com/david-hudson/patent-oz.html">http://monatomic.earth.com/david-hudson/patent-oz.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>The process described in his 'US patent' (which curiously specifies no patent
<br>
number, no patent application number, application date, etc.), part II, is
<br>
simply a complex method of creating 24 carat gold as a monatomic powder. Hudson
<br>
claims that the valence electron of his 'ORME' gold is 'unavailable' for
<br>
chemical reactions, making the powder chemically inert. The only way this would
<br>
occur would be if the gold is NOT monatomic, but is oxidized, or for some odd
<br>
reason the electrons from lower shells have filled all gaps in the outermost
<br>
shell. Its rather obvious that if such were the case, the gold atoms would emit
<br>
photons as the electrons sought to drop to the lowest possible orbit for which
<br>
there was space available, or that the electrons would be compressed into lower
<br>
orbits in violation of nuclear physics. Morover, his claims that the hydrogen
<br>
being stripped from the HQu molecule in the last step, leaving the gold as
<br>
'inert' chemically is just plain wrong, because even though that may strip the
<br>
lone electron from the outermost shell, that would leave the gold as a charged
<br>
free ion, decidedly NOT inert, as its the proton in the nucleus that creates the
<br>
+1 charge at that point. Removing a proton makes the atom become platinum.
<br>
<p>Monatomic gold is not special either, as is seen from this excerpt from
<br>
www.webelements.com:
<br>
&lt;&lt;It would not normally be necessary to make gold in the laboratory as it is
<br>
readily available  commercially. The most romantic way to extract gold is by
<br>
panning it out from a stream in some  pleasant valley but most such sources are
<br>
now depleted. Panning relies upon the density of gold  (which is very high)
<br>
being much greater than that of the sand and other particulates. It therefore 
<br>
settles to the bottom of the pan. 
<br>
<p>Today, more often than not, gold is extracted from ores. These ores often
<br>
contain relatively little gold. Some of these processes cause environmental
<br>
concern. The ore is crushed to a powder so as to expose the small gold
<br>
particles. These are dissolved by treatment of the rock with cyanide solution in
<br>
air. The result of this is a gold cyanide complex. Addition of zinc powder to
<br>
the resulting solution precipitates out the gold.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4Au + 8NaCN + O2 + 2H2O  4Na[Au(CN)2] + 4NaOH
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2Na[Au(CN)2] + Zn  2NaCN + Zn(CN)2 + Au (s)
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; end quote...
</em><br>
<p>Monatomic gold is not so special. What this Hudson character is claiming to be
<br>
special is that he has somehow rewritten the laws of physics so as to allow the
<br>
electrons in a gold atom to live in lower orbits than is physically possible.
<br>
The guy is a quack, as are all of the other New Age whackjobs associated with
<br>
him...
