<p><em>&gt; &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hi again! After four months of conferences, symposia and courses on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanism, psychology, neurocience, biomodelling and everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; else I have finally time to settle back into the list. Seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everything is as usual here, everybody happy and gay and debating AI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; guns, death penalties and cryonics :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Welcome back, Anders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, the list is about the same as ever. Same old topics, same old complaints,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same old... same old. Interesting that people who engage a discussion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accelerating change (of the extropic kind) do not themselves seem to change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their minds, their opinions, their politics, their attitudes, or their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical positions.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt we all want to change our core values at an accelerating
<br>
pace. But sure, this list has remained remarkably constant. That is
<br>
one reason I could survive without it for so long :-) Seriously, I
<br>
think it is a good thing to break out of the old molds and create
<br>
anew. I guess this is why many oldtimers are not around, they are out
<br>
there doing stuff. I foresee a very similar risk for me. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You took courses on transhumanism!?!? Where do they offer courses on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism?
</em><br>
<p>Nowhere yet, to my knowledge. I attended the EU Advanced Computational
<br>
Neuroscience Course in Trieste for a month. Some interesting stuff,
<br>
especially if you like me love neuroscience. Perhaps the most
<br>
transhumanist talk was by Miguel Nicolelis, working on direct brain
<br>
control of robot arms in rats and monkeys. 
<br>
<p>I also gave a few lectures on AI, neural networks and the history and
<br>
future of computers to the participants in the Multimedia program at a
<br>
local university. Hmm, *they* got a lecture on transhumanism - when do
<br>
*I* get one? :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The idea that some will go on towards Singularity (or whatever) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the rest will remain, is of course one of the main Scary Arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Against the Singularity (cf. Stuart Brand, _The Clock of the Long Now_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and Jaron Lanier's edge piece). Exponential growth might also imply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exponential growth of differences, and this is generally viewed as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bad thing. After lecturing some first year students on waguely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanism related stuff, I noticed this was one of the arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; against it that seemed to work best. Well worth considering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand how the exponential growth of differences (a bad thing) works
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best as an argument against technological singularity. Or do I misunderstand?
</em><br>
<p>It might not carry that much weight to you or even the community here,
<br>
but among many people it is a compelling reason to think that there is
<br>
something undesirable with singularity. A knee-jerk libertarian
<br>
reaction would of course to blame egalitarianism, but I think there
<br>
are also deeper reasons. But it would be too complex to explain well
<br>
at this time of night; I think I'll save it for a more careful
<br>
analysis.
