<em>&gt;Is this a list for the exploration and advancement of extropianism, or is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a list for Gore bashers/Bush apologists?
</em><br>
<p>Am I not getting the full extropians mailing list feed?  I noticed 
<br>
one message from Michael S. Lorrey today doing a little Gore bashing, 
<br>
and maybe another message that celebrated Bush's win the other day, 
<br>
but that's pretty much it.
<br>
<p>Besides, Extropianism seems to wholeheartedly embrace many political 
<br>
concepts.  Notice the participation that David Brin's Libertarian 
<br>
writings recently generated.  Has something changed?  Is it beyond 
<br>
the pale for a couple of political comments to surface during such an 
<br>
extraordinarily historical episode in this country's (US's) history?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If you must rejoice in victory, do it in private.
</em><br>
<p>Could I get the list of Corwyn-approved topics and attitudes 
<br>
regarding those topics?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   There are things yet left
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be done that are much more important than beating your chest about an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outcome that you may yet come to regret.  As much as some others would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rejoiced at the other possible outcome, and come to regret it as well.
</em><br>
<p>Bleah.  I'm just thrilled to death that I won't be in the crosshairs 
<br>
of a Gore-targeted tax increase.  I'm by no means rich, but I know 
<br>
that I wasn't up for a Gore-targeted tax break.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
