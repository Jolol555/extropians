&quot;Skye&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:skyezacharia@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20A%20scary%20but%20HYPOTHETICAL%20question.&In-Reply-To=&lt;059c01c0414b$7f813260$bdbc473f@jrmolloy&gt;">skyezacharia@yahoo.com</a>&gt; has written,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think there's a confusion present in whatever system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created this.  If we apply genetic terms to ideas, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only assumption can be that they work to propogate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves, not people.  People can go die for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas care.  Martyr, even.
</em><br>
<p>Right, ideas can't care. People can, but usually don't.
<br>
Apathy, acedia, and existential angst have memetic as well as physiological
<br>
vectors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are a lot of flexible or adaptive type systems,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though, that will occasionally make a move to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomodate another system in order to enhance its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; success, but this is usually the exception rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rule.  I seem to remember certain neurological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studies reported in this book I read yesterday called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;A New Psychology of Men&quot; (I know, sounds stupid, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had several hours in the library and had already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gotten through ten books in the last two) in which it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said that male babies tend to actually be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional than female ones- and drew the conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there are sociologically inherent structures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which try to teach men to be unemotional in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respects through isolation and emotional scarring.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's right. I've heard of other studies which show that male babies are
<br>
held, cuddled, and caressed more than are female babies. Some researchers have
<br>
speculated that this may relate to boys' inferior verbal skills, compared to
<br>
girls.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Being that the social structure of a species is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adaptive and at least semi-functional in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system survival (a whole branch of sociology is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dedicated to this stuff, actually), it may be one case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which our individual genetic/behavioral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predilections are overriden by another reflexive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system- in this case the behavior of the societal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organism/brain/whatever.
</em><br>
<p>Other cases in which genetic/biological predilections are overridden by the
<br>
social organism include (but are not limited to) marriage, sportsmanship, and
<br>
soldiering.
<br>
As I said, The time has come to drop memetic
<br>
Darwinism, because it isn't fit for transhumans, and even less fit for extropic
<br>
Artilects and Spiritual Machines.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
