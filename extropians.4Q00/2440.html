I love that perspective, with my original training in engineering and my
<br>
personal life which some would say comes right out of a porn novel, no
<br>
wonder I love science fiction. I guess with my natural computer ability it
<br>
even predicts my love of cyberpunk.
<br>
<p>Thanks for the observation.
<br>
<p>Best Ralph
