You appear to be replying more to your post than to mine. :)
<br>
<p>I am arguing in favor of selecting out a representative stock of humans
<br>
that eschew enhancement. Not necessarily just the Amish and Mennonites.
<br>
Maybe we should have a lottery for people who want to enhance. Maybe we
<br>
should have a lottery for people who will be forced to not be enhanced.
<br>
<p>A genetic Ponzi scheme is what I was talking about--too obliquely, it
<br>
would seem. Hey, if some steroids are good, more must be better, right?
<br>
Etc.

<em>&gt; Ah, but lotteries breed lucky people (a la Niven) if there is such a

</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, No, it's better to play the lottery than invest...
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thats right. Investing takes hard work (thinking) and 'lots of money'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e. money many would prefer spending on beer and smokes). Anyone can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; play the lottery on spare change. ;-)
