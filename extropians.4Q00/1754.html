<em>&gt; &quot;So say the MIT Extropians on their World Wide Web site
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://mit.edu/extropians/">http://mit.edu/extropians/</a> and in the pamphlet that they sent out to freshmen a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few weeks ago. Under the self-applied label &quot;reasoned discourse,&quot; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropians' founders, Hanyoung Huang G, Jason P. Davis '98, and John R. Bender
</em><br>
<em>&gt; '00, are out to stir up and promote good old-fashioned white suburban
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prejudices.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Actually, what the Bostropians have said in their pamphlet is the truth as follows:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;MIT certainly lowers standards for women and åunderrepresented' minoritiesä The average woman at MIT is less intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ambitious than the average man at MIT. The average åunderrepresented' minority at MIT is less intelligent and ambitious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the average non-åunderrepresented' minority.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
MIT does, in fact, have lower standards of admission for women and underrepresented
<br>
minorities. Anders Hove has been a consistent liberal critic of bostropes on the
<br>
MIT campus, and, this is, after all, Massachusetts, birthplace of racial quotas and
<br>
affirmative action (and where it is still going strong across the state).
<br>
<p>Anders and his allies try to show this is not correct in the following:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Indeed, Jones added, the board scores of underrepresented minorities at MIT are higher than the mean scores for all students
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attending the top 40 schools. Because of this, Jones doubts anyone could reasonably draw any conclusions about differences in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualifications.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
THough they never state whether or not womens' or under-represented minorities'
<br>
board scores are lower than white males AT MIT, which is the point in question.
<br>
<p>This is not a statement of racist hate (though it does seem that Anders and company
<br>
do have some hatred toward white males), but of facts about MIT policies. BTW this
<br>
is old news among the Bostropes, as it happened three years ago or so. This is the
<br>
standard reaction you see in Boston among protected groups, if you try to point out
<br>
that the playing field is slanted, its you who gets labeled a racist....
<br>
<p>As for the MIT extropians having Ayn Rand quotes on their website, so what? If I
<br>
quote Stalin, does that make me a commie?
