<em>&gt; &gt; I saw a talk recently by Gary Hudson.  He stated that one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problems was getting $ in &quot;small&quot; chunks and that several hundred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; million would be enough to do the job, if it all came at once
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sigh.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's a whole way of going about this.  You figure you're going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need so much before you are profitable.  Take Gary's estimate (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is probably mostly to build the hardware), throw in some marketing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $$$, keeping the company alive while the sales ramp up, &amp;c.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then you structure it into rounds.  Seed financing at &lt;$5 million,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first round at $10 million a year later, second round at $100 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 18 months after that, then IPO (or private third round) for $200
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million, then profitable a year later.  Or something like that.
</em><br>
<p>There is quite a range of opinion, even inside the space entrepreneur
<br>
community, on the appropriate way to structure a space venture.
<br>
That is part of the reason there are multiple companies out there --
<br>
the differences of opinion on business models are *much* deeper
<br>
and harder to bridge than the differences of opinion on technology.
<br>
It's more fun (and easier) to talk about the technology, of course :-)
<br>
<p>My current opinion, after watching and participating in the
<br>
1990's era of space start-ups, is that there is a very fundamental
<br>
reason why sophisticated investors greatly prefer step-by-step
<br>
financing of companies.  If you give a large chunk of money to
<br>
a new company with a new team, you won't achieve the
<br>
desired result.  Building a company is a multi-step process, and
<br>
you have to develop the engineering team, the business model,
<br>
the market, etc. as you go.
<br>
<p>If a start-up gets too much money too soon, it tries to skip
<br>
engineering steps (to achieve too-short promised schedules),
<br>
and jump right into the biggest markets (with higher costs to
<br>
enter the market).  The odds of hitting multiple home runs
<br>
(on technology, targeting the right market, etc.) with the
<br>
first time at bat for a new team, are very low.
<br>
<p>Take a look at those ventures with lots of money (Beal, Kistler).
<br>
Did getting a lot of money solve their problems?  Or
<br>
worsen them?  Were their ideas about the target market and
<br>
technical approach sound?  If they had been required to take
<br>
incremental steps, would they have been able to do
<br>
mid-course corrections to stay in closer touch with an evolving
<br>
market?  I believe so.
<br>
<p>In my career so far (inside and outside of the rocket business),
<br>
I've seen many attempts to save time by skipping steps --- they
<br>
seldom work.  That lesson is the reason our company is focused
<br>
on achieving revenue from small, early steps.  Once those are
<br>
achieved, we will be in a far better position, with more business
<br>
and technical experience, to move on to more ambitious goals.
<br>
<p>Structuring a company so that each incremental step adds enough
<br>
value to the company to make a sound investment AT THAT
<br>
STEP is very hard.  So far, nobody has proven they have
<br>
a successful approach for making a good investment case for
<br>
space transportation.  Difficult though finding a deep-pocketed
<br>
angel has been, developing a business model that is a good
<br>
investment appears to be even harder.  However, I believe this
<br>
is the only approach which will work, and that even if the
<br>
deep-pocketed angel is found, the results would likely be
<br>
unhappy.
<br>
<p>Returning to the thread title, &quot;Private Space dead?&quot;, I
<br>
strongly believe that it has never been healthier.  I see an
<br>
increasing awareness of good business practices in the
<br>
space entrepreneur community.  I see more and more
<br>
credible business plans being quietly floated around.  I
<br>
see fewer and fewer people hoping for a deus ex machina
<br>
(&quot;If only NASA would...&quot; &quot;If only the Air Force would...&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If only BMDO would...&quot; &quot;If only Bill Gates would...&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If only Beal would...&quot;).  The trials of the marketplace
<br>
are forging stronger entrants.  If we can keep from pursuing
<br>
false hopes for another few years, and keep our eyes on
<br>
the real prize (profitability!), the chances for private
<br>
space companies are good IMO.  But they won't look
<br>
like the answer to your prayers ... at first.
