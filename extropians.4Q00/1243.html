<p>Oh, they're good for &quot;peaceful&quot; purposes.  They deliver a payload to a
<br>
target; that can be used for good or evil.  But, since their primary
<br>
purpose is war, the danger that anyone seeking to repurpose them into
<br>
useful stuff is actually just covering for acquisition of weapons is, in
<br>
the minds of the ICBMs' current holders, too great to risk selling them.
<br>
Or, at least, so I understand.
<br>
<p>Besides, there's gotta be better ways than chemical fuels to achieve
<br>
orbit.  Get the fuel to achieve orbit to under 10% of the rocket's mass,
<br>
and that alone would probably get you cheap access to space, relative to
<br>
today's costs.  (It'd probably be more due to reduced maintenance to
<br>
reduced mass, than directly to reduced fuel costs, but cheaper is
<br>
cheaper.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I won't embellish my question any further because you can see where I'm

</em><br>
<p>So, what do rocket scientists call their not-as-tough-as-one-would-think
<br>
problems?
