<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt;Didn't Russell and Whitehead show that 'logic' supplied the
<br>
S&gt;rules underlying both mathematics and language in Principia
<br>
S&gt;Mathematica ... maths is purely logically, and cannot be
<br>
S&gt;&quot;proven by science empirically.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How do you know?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you want to resist philosophy, then stop thinking about that question
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right now, you'd need philosophical concepts to answer it.
</em><br>
<p>No I don't, just clear thinking ... no philosophical training needed!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Isn't logic a subset of philosophy? It was in the philosophy department at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my college. I'm sure you know Russell was an academic philosopher.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe it was, but academic philosophers would like to think that
<br>
every academic pursuit is a subset of philosophy! Russell was a CND
<br>
campaigner, I suppose that makes him a politician as well ... and he
<br>
started out as a mathematician .... I am not sure labels are that helpful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Philosophy suffers the same problem AI does. Once you solve the problem,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's not considered philosophy anymore.
</em><br>
<p>What solved problems do you have in mind here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Philosophy is the fertilizer, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brainstorming room. The best results from there (and it takes a sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;millennia to get them) are then passed on to the appropriate department.
</em><br>
<p>Most academic research runs on a much tighter timescale ... are you sure
<br>
that the &quot;appropriate department&quot; or even the Institution itself will still
<br>
be
<br>
around to benefit from these breakthroughs from the Philosophy department
<br>
after 1,000's of years?
<br>
<p>You are correct in pointing out that philosophy is fertilizer!!!!! Utter
<br>
bullshit.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might be surprised to find that Descartes (&quot;I think therefore I am&quot; is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he's most famous for) wrote extensively on meteorology, mechanics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physiology, etc. Aristotle wrote extensively on biology, Plato on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government.
</em><br>
<p>So what is your point here? These thinkers owe nothing to the narrow
<br>
and recent tradition of academic philosophy. When I dig for coal I am
<br>
a miner, when I study plants I am a botanist &amp;c.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The first debates about atoms were held among philosophers in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ancient Greece. Pythagora (spelling?), who discovered the Pythagorean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theorem and many other facts about numbers, had a cult of philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;students whose behavior was in some respects more bizarre then the Heaven's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Gate castration comet suicide cult.
</em><br>
<p>Pythagorean magicians might dispute your claiming of Pythagoras for
<br>
academic philosophy .....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Newton was considered a philosopher who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solved the greatest philosophical problem of his time, the motion of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;planets.
</em><br>
<p>Newton and Descartes were both alchemists, and Descartes' best
<br>
friend Beckman was a well known astrologer .... so why not
<br>
categorise them as occultists instead of philosophers, physicists,
<br>
or scientists .... I think the best thinkers are able to spread their nets
<br>
widely, and so will be read across the board in the knowledge of
<br>
their day.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The reason that the field of philosophy has narrowed so much over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the past few thousands of years is that it has been so successful. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solved so many of its problems that they can now be dealt with by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-philosophers.
</em><br>
<p>No, other disciplines got frustrated from being bogged down in philosophy
<br>
departments and hived off! The issues (for instance in Psychology) remain,
<br>
but are now being solved by  professional experimenters not by amateur
<br>
armchair theorists.
<br>
<p>Philosophy didn't really exist as a distinct academic discipline until TH
<br>
Green
<br>
and other Clergy in the C19th .... Descartes would not have been in a
<br>
&quot;philosophy&quot; department, because there were just two faculties .. theology
<br>
and (natural) philosophy .... all the science and maths had this catch-all
<br>
heading. I like interdisciplinary approaches and feel academia would benefit
<br>
from being less divided in the modern age.
<br>
<p>S&gt; &gt;It seems to me that all theory is philosophy, and the scientific
<br>
S&gt; &gt;method converts theory (possible fantasy) into fact (provable
<br>
S&gt; &gt;reality).
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt;You are stretching the term &quot;philosophy&quot; to a ludicrous extent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When you think &quot;philosophy&quot;, think &quot;pre-natal science&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>But  the priesthood from the land of Khem invented chemistry &amp;
<br>
maths, plus astronomy, so when you think &quot;magick&quot; think proto-science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt;A question for you defenders of academic philosopher: name
<br>
S&gt;just one (real world, useful) problem solved by philosophy in
<br>
S&gt;the past 100 years? Or name a single theory universally agreed
<br>
S&gt;by academic philosophers?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Are you suggesting that universal agreement is equivalent to truth? It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not. There are a number of problems I consider &quot;solved&quot; which are not
</em><br>
agreed
<br>
<em>&gt;upon at all. For example, the question of the purpose of life, the question
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of whether God exists, and the question of what is the value of truth.
</em><br>
<p>No, but if it is *objectively* true, then there will surely be tacit
<br>
agreement.
<br>
&quot;What is the value of truth&quot; is a generalised pseudo-question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But, for philosophy problems solved with general agreement in the past 100
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years, Quantum and Atomic Physics answered (partially) questions asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thousands of years ago by Atomism. Calculus (I'm going back a few hundred,
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt;know) gives the tools to mathematically solve problems about time and
</em><br>
motion
<br>
<em>&gt;posed thousands of years ago by Zeno. Eventually, (some) questions about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness will be answered by the departments already starting to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it over from philosophy and do empirical research, which is psychology.
</em><br>
<p>Consciousness has been sorted by MVT!!! To my satisfaction at very least.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You're looking for problems which have been solved to the satisfaction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experts, but which are still considered philosophical problems, but this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impossible by the definition of &quot;philosophy&quot;, for reasons outlined above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Once it's put in a way that allows it to be addressed by empirical or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematical methods, it's no longer considered philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>So why not give the problems direct to the relevant other departments
<br>
to get a speedy resolution? Cut out the time-wasting middlemen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It can take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thousands of years and thousands of philosophers to reach that point. Would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you criticize the value of Kindergarten by asking &quot;name a single useful
</em><br>
book
<br>
<em>&gt;written by or invention invented by a Kindergartener&quot;, well, none while
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt;were still in Kindergarden.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I think Philosophy can be covered in kindergarten! I do accept
<br>
&quot;History of Philosophy&quot; as a valid academic category. But &quot;critical
<br>
thinking skills&quot; should be hived off to debating societies and rhetoric
<br>
study on the one hand, and something like speed-Shogi  to improve
<br>
problem solving, strategic ability and mental alertness on the other.
<br>
<p><p>S&gt;I am yet to be convinced that transhuman thought is any more
<br>
S&gt;than a waiting room for the posthuman world. The convergence
<br>
S&gt;&quot;singularity&quot; might never happen, so why not get on with establishing
<br>
S&gt;posthuman society now? Human, conventionalist philosophers have
<br>
<em>&gt;failed to engage with the public ... I can think of none who is a
</em><br>
S&gt;house-hold name or who has any particular wisdom to convey to
<br>
S&gt;the common masses ... academic philosophy is turgid and
<br>
S&gt;unimportant. Or am I missing something?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes, the &quot;common masses&quot; are not a gauge of anything.
</em><br>
<p>Socrates used to give his orations in the marketplace ...  and the
<br>
medievalists held the model of &quot;everyman&quot; fairly central in their debates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Can you name a single transhumanist who is a household name, who can engage
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the public more then any academic philosopher?
</em><br>
<p>But Philosophy departments have had 100+ years start ... I became posthuman
<br>
only
<br>
during the 1980's, and transhuman thought didn't really get going until the
<br>
1990's.
<br>
I fully intend to become a household name though ...... as should other
<br>
afterhumans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Does that mean it's &gt;turgid and unimportant?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Can you name any biochemist who is a household name?
</em><br>
<p>Crick and Watson? I take your point ... but biochemistry is by its nature a
<br>
specialist
<br>
and technical discipline and the average Joe cannot be expected to
<br>
understand the
<br>
intricacies of it. Philosophy claims to be addressing big universal
<br>
questions that are
<br>
understood by all, and should be able to decant the philosophical jargon and
<br>
contortions back to common language explanations that can enthuse everyone.
<br>
<p>I think Russell (and AJ Ayer, my old Prof.) were the last to be well known
<br>
in the UK.
<br>
The challenge as I see it is to hive off (solve) what remains of academic
<br>
philosophy,
<br>
since as you have pointed out it progress involves questions being
<br>
&quot; put in a way that allows it to be addressed by empirical or
<br>
<em>&gt;mathematical methods, it's no longer considered philosophy.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>A couple of &quot;End of Year&quot; questions:
<br>
Should posthumans aim to evolve into a separate and distinctive species (or
<br>
strand) ..... or should the aim be to 'upgrade' the &quot;common masses&quot; to
<br>
posthuman?
<br>
I am aware of some posthuman 'communities' growing up
<br>
outside of normal society ...  and in support of this &quot;advance guard&quot;
<br>
strategy
<br>
is that if &quot;Trans(itional) Human&quot; is to mean anything at all, then there
<br>
should be
<br>
discernable demarcation between transhumance &amp; common humans .... and an
<br>
even greater demarcation between humans and post-humans.
<br>
<p>My challenge to orthodox philosophy is in order to  bring about an
<br>
intertheoretic
<br>
AND an interdisciplinary reduction to make things more efficient. Sure,
<br>
preserve
<br>
&quot;History of Philosophy&quot; by all means, but let us establish a credible
<br>
&quot;Afterhuman
<br>
Aesthetic&quot; or &quot;school of philosophy&quot; to challenge the creaky old received
<br>
norms.
