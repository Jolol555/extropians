Just got this in my inbox today from Good Morning Silicon Valley.  The NASA
<br>
press release is dated 12/18/2000.  This is hot off the presses...
<br>
<p><a href="http://www1.msfc.nasa.gov/NEWSROOM/news/releases/2000/00-336.html">http://www1.msfc.nasa.gov/NEWSROOM/news/releases/2000/00-336.html</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;NASA Space Technology Shines Light on Healing
<br>
Doctors at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee have discovered the
<br>
healing power of light with the help of technology developed for NASA's
<br>
Space Shuttle. Using powerful light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, originally
<br>
designed for commercial plant growth research in space, scientists have
<br>
found a way to help patients here on Earth.
<br>
Doctors are examining how this special lighting technology helps
<br>
hard-to-heal wounds, such as diabetic skin ulcers, serious burns, and severe
<br>
oral sores caused by chemotherapy and radiation. The project includes
<br>
laboratory and human trials, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
<br>
Administration and funded by a NASA Small Business Innovation Research
<br>
contract through the Technology Transfer Department at NASA's Marshall Space
<br>
Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.&quot;
