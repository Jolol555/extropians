<em>&gt; &gt; I think this is so far perhaps the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; convincing practical step towards exploring what it would be like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be posthuman. The technology is clunky, but it is a forerunner in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same way Douglas Englebart's demonstration of a primitive mouse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interface, cut-and-paste, hypertext and computer network in the 60's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was a forerunner of today's interfaces and networks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree, this is a fascinating concept and one which I would like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explore as the technology becomes cheaper.  The article mentioned Doug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Platt, an Extropian who was active in this area.  Several years ago at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a party at Max's house I met Doug (I think it was Doug) who demonstrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his wearable equipment, a PC with a chord keyboard he could wear on his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belt, and a head-mounted display (HMD).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Of course, the big question is whetehr wearables will be the way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; go, or if PDAs will out-compete them. In the same way, good wearables
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may block development of direct brain-computer interfaces beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; medical use.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With the Palm VII and WAP enabled Internet phones, wearables may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem obsolete, but the display bandwidth provided by these devices is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so limited that it restricts their usefulness.  A wireless internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connection feeding a HMD would be far more useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Have you seen the prototype HMD which is just an add-on to standard glasses,
<br>
in which the display is projected into what looks like a .5mm square on one
<br>
lens? Apparently the display appears to float in space about 2 feet away.
<br>
That kind of device plus wearcomp, plus possibly voice recognition, makes
<br>
PDAs look like the pieces of shite that they really are.
<br>
<p>Really, I think that PDAs and mobiles are precursors to wearables. I assume
<br>
that we'll be looking at discrete, wearable devices which communicate
<br>
wirelessly, and keep you fully hooked-in. The PDA will move toward a full
<br>
personal computer in processing power, with display seperating into HMV,
<br>
discrete speaker in ear, guts of the thing on your belt (or in your pocket,
<br>
or whatever). Maybe you keep a handwriting tablet until voice recognition
<br>
gives better input capabilities. Certainly, those twiddlers have got to be
<br>
an intermediate phase!
<br>
<p>And of course, the mobile integrates into the PDA (perhaps a modular add-on
<br>
for a while, still usable stand-alone), taking advantage of the ear-speaker
<br>
and voice pickup already added to the &quot;PDA&quot;.
<br>
<p>I don't think these little toys will block wearables. I think people love
<br>
their PDAs and Mobiles, but do struggle with their limitations. These
<br>
devices are the beginning of wearcomp.
