<em>&gt; Michael Lorrey cites a number of grounds for questioning the limits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 16th Amendment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since this whole topic came up, I've done a little more reading.  I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a lawyer, but I bounced a couple of questions off a law student.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is however, not legal opinion, just some random discursive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts on the topic.  Let me take the points one by one:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Some of the arguments are based on the idea that the amendment was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    not properly ratified.  I've not seen the evidence, but whatever it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    is is presumably part of public records.  Everyone who pays income
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    taxes has had a tremendous interest in seeing them nullified for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    decades, but there's been not much progress in that direction.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    seems that barring a wealth of new evidence, the overwhelming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    success the government has had in getting acceptance that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    amendment was ratified will not be reversed.  It's been almost a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    century.  It would probably be easier to repeal the amendment than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    to get it nullified on such grounds, in my humble opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. The definition of income.  The amendment says, &quot;incomes, from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    whatever source derived&quot;.  I suspect that many ordinary citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    who might otherwise be allies in seeking to nullify the income tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    on these grounds, agree with the Libertarian Party on this: they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    aren't interested so much in judicial theories as in what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &quot;plain language&quot; seems to say.  Naturally, this may sometimes be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    controversial and misleading, but in this case, if income were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    meant to have a narrow definition, the term used is colossally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    misleading.  Even if it is meant that way, again, the long history
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    of interpreting it the way it is now extends back nearly a century
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    and has been well accepted.  As long as there is any room for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    doubt, I suspect the plain language to be so persuasive that most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    people will willingly grant the government the benefit of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    doubt.  Again, I think it would simply be easier to get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    amendment repealed than to win the argument on these grounds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. Yet another argument is that there are loopholes which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    amendment doesn't cover, such as one established by a really old
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    case cited in the article.  I suspect this to be a mirage,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    essentially.  My guess is that the case history on many laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    contains some conflicting or inconsistent opinions.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    unsurprising that the opinion that seemed to find a loophole was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    very old.  By now, I suspect one would meet with near unanimity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    from the courts in rejecting such arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. Finally, there is an argument that the code itself makes payment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    voluntary.  Again, I wouldn't be surprised if there are portions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    the code that seem to say that -- it's gigantic.  However, as with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    the case law, though there may be inconsistencies, I expect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    courts are not going to accept such a questionable exemption, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    else wouldn't many wealthy people routinely be paying no income tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    on those grounds?  If their tax advisors thought they could get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    away with it, the wealthy people would.  If anyone is getting away
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    with it, I suspect it's because the number of people and amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    money in question is small.
</em><br>
<p>Wealthy people tend to be vested in instruments that place them in
<br>
positions of liability underthe code, so they tend to, as a rule, be
<br>
liable for taxes. Allegedly the nomenclature in the tax code that
<br>
explains the various portions of individual people's tax ID numbers
<br>
within the IRS computer system shows that this ID number states whether
<br>
the individual is liable for paying taxes or is merely a voluntary
<br>
payee.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If people get away with not paying income tax, I'm happy for them.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think taxation is theft.  I pay my taxes because I can't afford the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk, and I don't expect the courts or our society really to respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any arguments on these grounds.  I think it would be easier to get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 16th Amendment repealed than to win widespread respect for these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questionable loopholes.
</em><br>
<p>There is also the argument that I didn't mention: You cannot
<br>
legitimately be required to comply with a law you cannot understand. A
<br>
number of tax cases have been won by presenting sections of tax code to
<br>
the judge and asking him to explain what they mean. If the judge, a
<br>
lawyer, cannot understand it enough to explain it to people, then
<br>
average people cannot be expected to understand it either. Because the
<br>
tax code is such a huge heap of spaghetti code, referencing code in many
<br>
other locations back and forth, it is legitimately incomprehensible by
<br>
the average citizen. Just as children, and severely mentally retarded or
<br>
insane people cannot be convicted of some crimes due to their inability
<br>
to comprehend their crime, if you can't comprehend the tax code, then
<br>
you cannot be held responsible for not obeying it.
