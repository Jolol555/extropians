<em>&gt; &gt; Nowthen, suppose we go ahead and accept things the way

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; either the Democrat or the Republican.  I dont know the exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; numbers, but suppose that currently the likely voters are as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Republican:  45%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Democrat:  46%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Green:  2%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Libertarian:  2%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; undecided:  5%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If this is the case, then obviously this election is going to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cliffhanger,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You really have to look at it state-by-state, though. It's the electoral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breakdown that matters, not the popular vote.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but it still averages out. Enough of a razor thing margin in enough states
<br>
does give you a landslide in the electoral college.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the outcome is important as all hell,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it? Sure, given the choice between Gore and Bush I'd rather see Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elected. But they're idealogically so close that I don't think it matters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much which is elected. And who knows...if Gore is elected and goes overboard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his liberal agenda it could cause a swing back toward smaller, less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intrusive government. Or maybe not.
</em><br>
<p>Compared to Browne or Nader, yes, they are ideologically close, but still each
<br>
is on opposite sides of a razor thin line. There are crucial differences which
<br>
are of paramount importance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suppose further that:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1)  You decide you will donate 500 bucks to some political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; party and 20 hours of your time campaigning for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2)  That you are a Libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What is the most logical thing to do?  Vote Republican, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *second* choice, and donate your money and time to...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the GREEN PARTY!  Your last choice!  The Eco-nazis!
</em><br>
snip
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So, Mike, you are absolutely right, dammit.  {8-[  The logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thing for a pragmatic Green to do is to vote Democrat and campaign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for and donate to Browne, while the most logical thing for a pragmatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Libertarian to do is to vote Republican and donate to Darth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nader.  Libertarians for eco-totalitarianism.  Greens for Browne.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ill be damned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What am I missing?  spike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're missing the long view. Despite the fairly close polls at this time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the election will probably be another electoral landslide. Your 100 votes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtracted from Gore still won't have any effect on the outcome of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; election, even multiplied by hundreds if you could convince others to do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same thing. So while this strategy maximizes your effect on the coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; election, its not going to be enough.
</em><br>
<p>When you switch someone to Nader from Gore, yes, he only loses one vote, though
<br>
if you can talk someone into voting for Bush as well, then you have a two vote
<br>
change. Since votes are typically bought in the market for $2-5 each, $500 will
<br>
change 100 votes away from your opponent, while your pro Bush vote is 1, for a
<br>
change of 101. Each person you convince to follow your strategy also changes 101
<br>
votes, and everyone they convice likewise. Its an exponential growth thing. If
<br>
you convince six people, and they convince six people, etc. within 6 levels of
<br>
argument, you've won the election. Its multi-level politicking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we should be looking at the next election, the one after that, or the one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after that. We should be growing the Libertarian Party. First we want to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to the point that most people are aware of it--enough that LP candidates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will get press commensurate with their poll numbers. Next, maybe the LP
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presidential candidate draws enough votes to have changed the outcome of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; election. At that point, Demos and Repubs will start adopting Libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas to draw Libertarian voters, and even without a Libertarian President
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we'll start to see some Libertarian initiatives. Eventually, a Libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; candidate will be a serious contender and the duopoly will be a thing of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past.
</em><br>
<p>Both sides have been adopting libertarian ideas that fit with their own agendas.
<br>
You just can't seem to get either side to get away from their opposing buffet
<br>
style attitudes toward the Bill of Rights. We all have our own ideas of which
<br>
ones are more important, we are only human. This is where you need to apply a
<br>
little of that extropic 'practical optimism'...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're also missing the fact that it's morally reprehensible to support your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemies. If every Libertarian did as you suggest, the Greens would get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge boost and the LP would be seriously set back.
</em><br>
<p>Its standard ChiCom insurgency strategy to strengthen the hand of extremists
<br>
among your opponents to increase the pressure on the population to sympathize
<br>
with your side. This is why dems are kings of negative campaigning, saying how
<br>
nasty, selfish, mean, and cruel their opponents are, painting them as
<br>
extremists, and why the media gives idiots like Buchanan so much airtime versus
<br>
someone like Harry Browne.
