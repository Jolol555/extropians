<p>
i hesitate to enter the ring of fire that is extropian discussion, so i will 
<br>
do it by initiating what i would hope is a new thread.
<br>
<p>i have followed with great interest all traffic on this list for nearly two 
<br>
weeks, prior to my first posting. the extropian idea, and more grandly, the 
<br>
positive, rational, scientific, wholistic idea that this list embraces, is 
<br>
very seductive to me. it seems i have found a forum for such discussion and 
<br>
query.
<br>
<p>i am, a little impressed, overly-so, perhaps, by the population of this 
<br>
list. intellegentsia, authors, tenured faculty, researchers into computer 
<br>
theory, artists, and i.
<br>
<p>and who am i? well, i'm not really anyone. a student, certainly, though a 
<br>
poor one. i just managed to graduate high school, limping painfully through 
<br>
the gates to college, where my first semester has proven to be a rousing 
<br>
failure in study, integration, and grading. i'm an audience for authors and 
<br>
posters, and a generalist without any real expertise to point to. i haven't 
<br>
even centered on one particular job type, floating, instead through the fray 
<br>
of disconnected part time work that is the life of a statistical &quot;youth&quot;.  
<br>
my touted sense of &quot;identity&quot; is more due to the requirements of assignments 
<br>
and social interaction than that of real feeling of belonging or ownership.
<br>
<p>it is inspiring to me that ideas and the humble device of free 
<br>
messaging(provided gratefully to me by hotmail since prior their microsoft 
<br>
buyout) might bridge and provide a sort of informational social mobility 
<br>
between myself and such (to my mind) successful persons.
<br>
<p>i realize this all sounds very fatous and self-effacing, but i must first 
<br>
get through my own reactions to the extropian thought i've been exposed to, 
<br>
before i can begin to contribute. or so it seems to me.
<br>
<p>the point, i believe, is that we need not be limited to as we are. i am self 
<br>
aware. so, being self aware, i may, at will, attempt to change myself. i 
<br>
might lift weights to give myself a pleasing shape, and joyful strength, or 
<br>
study acrobatics, and learn the pleasure of cheating gravity and common 
<br>
sense. i also might study, or practice, and become more organized and wise. 
<br>
i can also surround myself with devices and strategems to increase my 
<br>
efficiency, and speed my input and output. i might also change myself 
<br>
physically. build myself a faster mind, or give myself another sense(perhaps 
<br>
sonar, or a gps sense)
<br>
or live forever.
<br>
<p>this is an inspiring, and positive notion. one that i am quite new to. but 
<br>
one that i would desperately believe, because it provides me a way out of 
<br>
what i see as our(humanity's) trap we have built. we have become the weak 
<br>
link in our own creation. no longer is technology, or food, or population, 
<br>
or resources the limiting factor in our development. it is our own inablity 
<br>
to accept our development. technology is delayed because of public reaction, 
<br>
we interact so slowly with our computers that we become frustrated with 
<br>
them.  fundamentalists oppose medical technology,  and we ourselves are 
<br>
unable to conceptualize greater uses for our near magical technology, simply 
<br>
because we are standing by our biases of what technology should be.
<br>
<p>computers get faster and for what? to play games? type papers with prettier 
<br>
interfaces? fifty years since world war two, and the greatest advance in 
<br>
military technology is reliability and rate of fire in firearms that project 
<br>
lead bullets. we sent a man to the moon with computers that my optical mouse 
<br>
would sneer at in processor power. we have computers that multiply millions 
<br>
of vectors in seconds, and we struggle to keep ourselves in check. the 
<br>
function of government is to keep ourselves from self destructing, much less 
<br>
accomplishing anything.
<br>
<p>we have looped ourselves. the answer is not  just technology, but a 
<br>
technological self awareness. and the ability to change, that  this self 
<br>
awareness brings.
<br>
<p>i realise that this is a highly technical list. but i know that you agree 
<br>
with me, when i say that there are many ways just to improve your biological 
<br>
mind that people ignore. news stories about the Mozart effect, the power of 
<br>
visualization, daily mental gymnastics, mathmatical synergy in almost every 
<br>
subject, and meta-programming go quietly in to the night, without a whisper 
<br>
from our people. mental abilities are given a &quot;god-given&quot; stamp, and it is 
<br>
assumed that if it doesn't come easy, you weren't meant to do it.
<br>
<p>worse, we become a nation of obese, self-loathing consumers. the standard of 
<br>
beauty becomes more and more stratified, as the average human becomes more 
<br>
mediocre and unchallanged.
<br>
<p>if we can't even imagine maxing out the capabilities of our biological 
<br>
bodies, what hope to we have of replacing or augmenting them, the masses may 
<br>
well ask us. much less evolving into beings with significantly different 
<br>
mindscapes and goal structures?
<br>
<p>into this, the extropian principle.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will be greater, at all costs. augmentar!
<br>
<p>there, is a toast i can drink to.
<br>
<p>but my question remains. what of us? (i for the purposes of this point out 
<br>
that i am far closer to the masses than the post-human, with my 
<br>
self-limiting mindsets, and dim horizons) i am a person who is trapped by my 
<br>
thought-processes and mindsets, yes, but i am trapped nonetheless.
<br>
<p>how will you help me, and my friends like me? what is it that the future 
<br>
offers me, and you who see it, and lust after it so keenly?
<br>
<p>i have heard you call yourself post-human, but i am just a young man. not 
<br>
even a very clever one.
<br>
how do we get from here to there?
<br>
what is the bridge that i am missing?
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>i realize this isn't very clear, and very long and boring. but if someone 
<br>
could struggle through it, and show me what it is, and where the road 
<br>
starts, i would be grateful.
<br>
