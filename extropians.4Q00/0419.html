</em><br>
<p>Amara follows this with the amplitude-squared equation that would form
<br>
the basis for quantum particle probability distributions, plus related
<br>
comments by Ariel Caticha:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The main motivation for this article has come from realizing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the derivations in Cox still apply if real numbers are replaced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex numbers as the encoders of partial truth.
</em><br>
<p>So, all the properties of quantum waves could be coming from a
<br>
mathematically neat, expanded definition of what it means for a
<br>
particle's position to be uncertain? Follow Jayne's suggestion, consider
<br>
a higher phase space perhaps, and our own uncertainty about location in
<br>
that space could produce interference effects, qubit computers, and
<br>
everything else predicted by the standard quantum math?
<br>
<p>Thanks for the further detail. Up to a point I do find this persuasive,
<br>
at least in the sense that it might well be wrong to assume the reality
<br>
of Many Worlds alternate histories. The flow of the anti--Many Worlds
<br>
argument here is that if quantum predictive structures (i.e., state
<br>
vectors, wave functions) *were* objectively real, then Many Worlds
<br>
*would* be quite strongly indicated (despite there being some other,
<br>
alternative interpretations, in the case of state vectors being real).
<br>
So, if the state vectors, etc., are only non-local probability
<br>
treatments for some advanced way of positioning in real space, you've
<br>
then eliminated the argument in favor of Many Worlds.
<br>
<p>One area where I continue to doubt this &quot;non-local vector&quot; idea is when
<br>
I consider that an entire, difficult-to-foresee chain of consequences
<br>
can sometimes block the &quot;travel&quot; of these quantum waves or vectors. I've
<br>
read this in some of the ideas relating to interaction-free
<br>
measurements, where it is said that quantum measurements could even very
<br>
often tell if a &quot;bomb&quot; is live, as opposed to possibly being a dud! I
<br>
presume that the &quot;bomb&quot; in this case would have to be a small thing,
<br>
like one of those &quot;SQUID&quot; devices, so that one could cool it, and keep
<br>
it thermally isolated, so as to maintain it in quantum coherence while
<br>
one is testing to see if it is a live bomb or not.
<br>
<p>Apparently, the &quot;liveness&quot; of the trigger on such a bomb, can *itself*
<br>
be enough for the trigger to block the quantum wave of a passing photon.
<br>
This is in a situation where a &quot;dud&quot; bomb's trigger essentially would
<br>
never block the path of the photon's wave in that location. In this
<br>
experiment, it seems that if we were going to track a photon through a
<br>
higher state space, consistent with these predictions, then that space
<br>
would *necessarily* contain information about whether the bomb *could*
<br>
explode or not! At the same time, if Nature's state space actually codes
<br>
this information about the &quot;could be&quot; explosion of the bomb, this is
<br>
similar to saying that the &quot;could be&quot; explosions really exist in Nature,
<br>
in such a way that the explosion event blocks the wave even as the
<br>
resulting new timeline branches away from our own. Notice that the
<br>
essence of this *is* in some sense quite statistical, since one half of
<br>
such test situations, done on a set of live bombs, will actually explode
<br>
the little bomb in our own timeline. It's the other half of the trials
<br>
that are the mysterious part, the times when quantum theory tells you
<br>
that a bomb is almost surely live, but where it doesn't explode in *our*
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>If the true logic of this is as been described, it becomes difficult to
<br>
see the quantum wave properties as being only statistical models in our
<br>
minds. For example, if we could test parachutes in a comparable manner,
<br>
we'd never have to examine the 'chutes to see if they are folded right!
<br>
Instead, we'd just hang &quot;quantum crash dummies&quot; from them and certify
<br>
the ones that test as &quot;sure to open&quot; without *really* opening (if you
<br>
see what I mean). In this case, if it were specified that we were not
<br>
going to examine or model the details of the parachute, but quantum
<br>
testing could point out a good 'chute anyway, we'd be getting our
<br>
knowledge more from the quantum world itself than from any probability
<br>
representation of it. So, I still don't know the right answer to this
<br>
question of quantum alternate worlds, given that &quot;might have beens&quot; can
<br>
apparently have a direct causal effect on real measurements.
<br>
<p>Maybe I'm just being stubborn or something, I don't know :)
