</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I consider this kind of use of time machines logically impossible; it's a

</em><br>
<p>Not every use of a time machine creates a grandfather paradox.  We're
<br>
not talking about killing your previous self, just about giving them $1
<br>
more to spend back then.  I see nothing paradoxical about that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In any case, such hypotheticals are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impossible to calibratable; there's no way to determine if stated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;preferences mean anything and excellent reasons that past
</em><br>
<em>&gt;preferences would be inaccurate and inconsistent.  There's sound
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Even if we accept that our preferences about our past selves are
<br>
less accurate and consistent, and that they are side effects of
<br>
stronger evolutionary pressures, there still remains the question of
<br>
what those preferences are and what they imply.
<br>
<p>Take music as an example.  You might say that we evolved a taste for
<br>
music as a side effect of evolutionary pressures to show off various
<br>
mental abilities, and now that we have so many other ways to show
<br>
off mental abilities, or that we have less need to do so, there is no
<br>
*real* use of or need for music.  But even if this is true, many of
<br>
us just like music, and policy analysis should take that into account.
