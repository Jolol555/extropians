</em><br>
<em>&gt;For those of you who read Ian Arcatling's first message, it is only fair to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inform you that it was apparently sparked by my recent mailing of Member
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Updates and Renewal Requests, which many of you have already received.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it wasn't.  I was not kidding when I wrote that I have never 
<br>
received anything.  I haven't.  That means that I haven't received whatever 
<br>
it is you are talking about in your posting.  All I have received is 
<br>
confirmation that I am (or was) a member.  That was some time in the fall 
<br>
last year, October, November, something like that.  After that, nothing.  
<br>
Even if you do mail things to members you have never mailed anything to me.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian
