&lt;DISCLAIMER&gt;
<br>
Again, don't get all wierded out. This really is a hypothetical
<br>
question, that just happened to wander into my head. I doubt it will
<br>
ever be a practical one for either myself or anybody else on this
<br>
list. Remember what I said earlier about survival at any cost-- my
<br>
self-preservation drive is doing just fine thank you. It's just that
<br>
it's good to know the answers to certain hypothetical questions
<br>
well ahead of time, so one doesn't have to waste precious seconds
<br>
deliberating if such questions do suddenly become practical.
<br>
&lt;/DISCLAIMER&gt;
<br>
<p>One's effectiveness in accheiving overarching goals is sometimes hobbled
<br>
by self-preservation. If one knew that one was going to die soon (and for
<br>
whatever reason cryosyspension was not an option) then self-preservation
<br>
would not longer influence one's decisions. How could one's strategy change
<br>
in response to this fact?
<br>
<p>Responses such as &quot;I'd liquidate all my assets and go on a cruise&quot; or
<br>
&quot;I'd spend my last days with my family&quot; are obvious and pre-emptively
<br>
declared to be out of scope. This question is aimed at people who have
<br>
such an intense sense of purpose that they want maximize the value of
<br>
even their demise toward their chosen goal. Or people who can imagine
<br>
themselves in such a mindset and extrapolate how they would act.
