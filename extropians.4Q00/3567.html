That's really interesting.
<br>
<p>Robin, have you asked your students who would upload if it were destructive
<br>
to the original? I'd be really interested to hear the answer to that.
<br>
<p>Myself, I think I'd allow uploads of myself. I think if I were an upload of
<br>
myself, I'd feel pretty altruistic toward the original, and help it get into
<br>
the machine, too. So, it seems like a good deal.

Subject: One third of my students would upload
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This last week I told my microeconomics students about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the economics of uploading this week.  I asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how many of them would be willing to make an upload
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy of themselves (assuming their original remained intact).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Five out of fifteen of them said they would.
