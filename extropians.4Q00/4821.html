BODY SHOPPING
<br>
FUTURISTS USE THE WEB TO PLAN A WORLD MERGING MAN, MACHINE
<br>
<p>By Dan Dinello
<br>
Special to the Tribune
<br>
December 28, 2000
<br>
<p>Imagine yourself a virtual living being, free of physical pain, able to
<br>
repair any damage to your mechanical body and with a downloadable mind that
<br>
never dies -- a post-biological human. Several 21st Century technologies --
<br>
prosthetics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence and
<br>
robotics -- may define a new era in human progress, the Post-Human Era. With
<br>
outposts all over the Internet, scientific idealists promote a positive --
<br>
almost religious -- vision of these emerging technologies' potential impact
<br>
on human evolution.
<br>
<p>Their outlook is in marked contrast to the often grim warnings about
<br>
advancing technology. Science-fiction films, for example, from &quot;Metropolis&quot;
<br>
to &quot;The Matrix,&quot; remain firmly rooted in these fears. (A more comprehensive
<br>
look at this technophobia will run next week.) Last year, computer scientist
<br>
Bill Joy warned, in Wired magazine, about the dangers of uncontrolled
<br>
technology: &quot;Why the Future Doesn't Need Us&quot;
<br>
(www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html)
<br>
<p>But as evidenced by the following Web sites and books, the miraculous
<br>
promise, no matter how theoretical, of these human-improving technologies
<br>
draws a rapt audience.
<br>
<p>Prosthetic technology regenerates a damaged body with artificial replacement
<br>
parts -- synthetic skin, mechanical heart valves, cochlear implants,
<br>
titanium jaws, hips, arms, legs, hands, feet. The Global Resource for
<br>
Orthotics and Prosthetics (www.oandp.com) provides links to numerous
<br>
corporate and informational Web sites related to these currently available
<br>
prostheses.
<br>
<p>Cutting-edge prosthetic research promises even more miraculous
<br>
possibilities. Scanning these research Web sites reveals developments in
<br>
working artificial devices for many organs -- kidneys, hearts, blood vessels
<br>
and livers. Retinal Implant (www.uak.medizin.unituebingen.de/depii/g
<br>
roups/subret/index-en.html) has developed technology that may provide sight
<br>
to the blind in a few years; Bizspace Pharma (www.bizspacepharma.com/
<br>
<p>Technology20%Articles/hand.htm) details research on artificial limbs
<br>
controlled by nerve impulses.
<br>
<p>Prosthetic research, with links to many research Web sites, is summarized at
<br>
BusinessWeek online (www.businessweek.com/2000/00-12/b3673025.htm).
<br>
<p>These prosthetic innovations of techno-science encourage a dream of
<br>
immortality through gradual replacement of all body parts.
<br>
<p>Biotechnology goes even further. Rather than provide a new artificial body,
<br>
biotechnologists want to prevent or cure disease by managing the body's
<br>
biological processes in ever-greater detail, leading to perfect health. Web
<br>
sites such as Bio OnLine (www.bio.com/os/start/home.html) and the government
<br>
site Biotechnology (www.nal.usda.gov/bic/) offer information about the
<br>
methods of biotech -- nanotechnology, genetic manipulation and cloning -- as
<br>
well as present and future applications.
<br>
<p>The many wonders of nanotechnology -- designing or evolving tiny machines or
<br>
biochips that can be programmed to operate within the human body -- have
<br>
been elaborately imagined by Eric Drexler in his 1987 book &quot;Engines of
<br>
Creation,&quot; available for free on The Foresight Institute Web site
<br>
(www.foresight.org/EOC/index.html).
<br>
<p>Among other things, he envisions a nanotech diagnostic tool of the future:
<br>
DNA-based computer chips, implanted into the body, will continuously analyze
<br>
a person's entire genome, determine when something goes wrong and provide
<br>
the information needed to apply treatments and cures.
<br>
<p>Other mind-boggling projections can be found at Nanotechnology magazine
<br>
(<a href="http://nanozine.com/">http://nanozine.com/</a>). A future nanotechnological cure for cancer might
<br>
involve injecting cell-size nano-robot machines, or nanobots, into the
<br>
afflicted person's body. Using genetic sensors, these nanobots may be able
<br>
to hunt down and destroy every cancer cell. Other diseases may also be
<br>
subject to nanobot attacks. For example, differently programmed nanobots
<br>
might be sent into the body to loosen tiny bits of artery plaque and clear
<br>
out clogged blood vessels. These and other intriguing nanontechnological
<br>
developments remain at an early stage.
<br>
<p>Another biotechnological method, cloning, involves the regeneration of
<br>
proteins, plants, animals and even humans from single cells. Brought to
<br>
public attention by the movie &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and the actual cloning of the
<br>
sheep Dolly, current cloning practices produce antibodies used in medicine
<br>
as well as drug manufacturing and disease diagnosis. Research, future
<br>
predictions and lots of Internet links can be explored at the New Scientist
<br>
Special Cloning Report
<br>
(www.newscientist.com/nsplus/insight/clone/clonelinks.html).
<br>
<p>Besides the possibility of growing entire replacement arms, feet, hearts or
<br>
livers, cloning may lead to human immortality through endless bodily
<br>
replication - as long as one remembers to extract and store his or her own
<br>
DNA. Gene banks for pets already exist on the Internet. Genetic Savings &amp;
<br>
Clone (www.savingsandclone.com) offers to extract DNA from your pet and
<br>
cryogenically store it. Human Cloning (www.globalchange.com/clonlink.htm)
<br>
provides visual explanations of the cloning process, future predictions,
<br>
links, news and ethical debate; Slouching Towards Creation: Peer Into the
<br>
Face of Cloning (www.pathfinder.com/TIME/cloning/dolly.html) provides
<br>
visuals plus essays on questions such as &quot;Human cloning: should it be done?
<br>
If it's done, what would it mean?&quot;
<br>
<p>Artificial intelligence and robotics experts envision an even more bizarre
<br>
method of attaining immortality. Their post-biological utopia assumes the
<br>
extinction of humans or, at least, their conversion into an almost
<br>
supernatural post-human species. On his Web site
<br>
(www.penguinputnam.com/kurzweil/links.htm), author and computer scientist
<br>
Ray Kurzweil -- the inventor of the first reading machine for the blind --
<br>
describes a future utopia in which humans live forever by becoming one with
<br>
robotic technology. Rather than preserving our bodies, this method discards
<br>
our death-susceptible physical form and aims to preserve our identity (our
<br>
minds) by downloading consciousness into a computer within a robot body. A
<br>
fascinating visual history and future projections of robot technology can be
<br>
seen at Android World (www.androidworld.com/index.htm)
<br>
<p>No one follows this post-biological line of speculation with the mechanist
<br>
abandon of Carnegie-Mellon robotics pioneer Hans Morevec
<br>
(www.frc.cmu.ri.edu/(tilde)hpm/). Moravec first seriously proposed
<br>
transferring our minds into machines in his 1988 book &quot;Mind Children&quot; and
<br>
developed the idea in his 1999 book &quot;Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent
<br>
Mind.&quot; On his Web site, Morevec says, &quot;By mid-century no human task,
<br>
physical or intellectual, should be beyond effective automation.&quot; Moravec
<br>
and Kurzweil both argue that humans should happily adapt to artificially
<br>
intelligent robotic technology and gain immortality or face extinction.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the most zealous proselytizers for this new brand of Homo Cyber are
<br>
the post-humanists known as the Extropians (www.extropy.com). The Extropians
<br>
spend a lot of time plotting out neo-Darwinian future scenarios dominated by
<br>
futuristic technologies. Navigating their Web site, you will find optimistic
<br>
predictions of off-world space colonies, advanced robotics, artificial
<br>
intelligence, nanotechnology and life extension through mental downloads.
<br>
Like religious mystics, the Extropians meticulously plan for the day when
<br>
technology will free us forever from the clutches of the earth, the body and
<br>
death itself.
