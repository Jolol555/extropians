I've taken the free subgun class. It's worth the trip and lodging
<br>
expenses (I drove from the SF Bay area). There is a pitch for Front
<br>
Sight offerings, as one would expect, but it's low key and the support
<br>
and student teacher ratio are excellent. They are for real, no snotty
<br>
macho BS or corner cutting. My only wish was that I'd had more time to
<br>
practice mounting the weapon to my shoulder. But that's a tiny thing.
<br>
Aside from that, they're very much in the &quot;perfect practice makes
<br>
perfect&quot; mold.
<br>
<p>One other caveat: I have heard from others that Dr. Piazza is a
<br>
Scientologist, but I had a dentist once who was one, and my teeth are
<br>
still fine; he didn't try to audit my teeth, he just fixed 'em. Just
<br>
FYI.

<em>&gt; Go to www.FrontSight.com and check out their free one day

<p>Very near Pahrump, in fact.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and is completely free (weapons and ammo are provided)
</em><br>
<p>Also Gatorade, snacks and sunblock. :)
<br>
<p>; all you have to do is
<br>
<em>&gt; get there (the course is a major loss leader to drum up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; publicity and students but you get real instruction).  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last course offered is in early December.  Maybe some of you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to go as a group, if so, let me know and we can set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something up.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Watch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _Shoah_, go to a few murder trials, and then tell me why you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will never need to use a gun or defend against one.
</em><br>
<p>There's a possibly apocryphal quote from one of the survivors of the
<br>
Warsaw ghetto who was involved in the resistance efforts there: &quot;My
<br>
biggest regret is that we didn't have a submachine gun.&quot;
<br>
<p>&lt;much thoughtful stuff elided&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whatever, it may be comforting and good for your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psyche to know that you can defend yourself even if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never need to.
</em><br>
<p>Competence at arms in an otherwise healthy psyche can only be a good
<br>
thing.
<br>
<p>Glad you're doing something about this. Gimme a call if you want to.
