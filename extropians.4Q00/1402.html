<p>Actually, the Pope infallibility thing was declared by a Pope (forgot
<br>
the name offhand) in the late 19th century.  The nasty problem of
<br>
whether popes were infallible before that and just didn't let on was
<br>
swept under the rug.  Also the pope gave himself and future popes an out
<br>
in that they are supposedly only  infallible when speaking 'ex
<br>
cathedra', which means something like in their most popish popishness or
<br>
pope as pope as infallible pope.  But supposedly they do have to say
<br>
when they are in this mode so people can know they are getting the
<br>
straight poop from the pope as pope.  Literally though it means &quot;in the
<br>
exercise of one's office with authority&quot;. So I don't know when a pope is
<br>
not a pope.  I guess when he is just so-and-so strolling around wearing
<br>
pope gear but not really presiding over some popish going on or other?  
<br>
<p>Some semi-illterate temple hanger-on measured the thing all this
<br>
argument has been about and declared it so and so amount.  That it is in
<br>
the bible, even if you accepted for a moment that was an infallible book
<br>
(which it obviously isn't and really shouldn't be), simply says that
<br>
what this boobie measured was accurately recorded.  I don't think the
<br>
verse in question claimed the measurement, the means of measuring or the
<br>
measurer were infallible.  I don't remember it talking about God
<br>
personally comming down and pulling out the god's own laser measuring
<br>
devices.  So are we done with this one yet?
