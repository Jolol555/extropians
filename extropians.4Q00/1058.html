<em> &gt; Hi Dan,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The people I know in the pro-space movement who are the leaders 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and movers and shakers - the ones who are going to get us into 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; space - are optimists for sure.  (Robert Zubrin of the Mars Society 
</em><br>
<p>Huh? They're going to get us into space by burning hundreds of
<br>
gigabucks (raised from which source?) to send canned monkeys off to
<br>
Mars, not even sustainably? And how they will bitch and moan about
<br>
immortal space heroes, when said monkeys succumb to a simple technical
<br>
defect, while being lightminutes distant? At least Shuttle Inc.'s
<br>
fireworks can be conducted in front an appreciative audience, no such
<br>
luck with Mars.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; BTW, we don't KNOW we're getting into space.  We are flying in circles 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and important missions are being cancelled.  NASA's gigantic &quot;humans
</em><br>
<p>There's a damn good reason they're being cancelled, because
<br>
post-cold-war countries don't have loose $$$s to burn, Shuttle tech
<br>
sucks, and 99% of humanity doesn't care a fig about space, probably
<br>
because they have trouble keeping their rice bowl full. You have to
<br>
work with whatever private venture capital is there, which is not much
<br>
yet. If it ain't enough, well, tough luck, buster. No better luck next
<br>
time, because, well, there will be no next time. Clamp down the
<br>
autoclave lid, and up the ante. Please vent before draining liquified
<br>
fat.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; in space&quot; budget has been spent on the shuttle, then the ISS (all 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; well and good, but not leaving Earth's gravity well) and is now going 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to be spent on a 4.5 billion dollar thing called the Space Launch 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Initiative which is not as good as it sounds, and again, all within
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the great gravity well.  We do have a sliver of a chance to encourage
</em><br>
<em> &gt; our new president to initiate a humans to Mars program.  Please see
</em><br>
<em> &gt; <a href="http://www.marchforspace.com">http://www.marchforspace.com</a> and add your &quot;reason for going into space&quot;.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; That will help the cause.  I have not announced this page to the world
</em><br>
<em> &gt; yet.  Just started it up and am waiting to get more &quot;reasons&quot; first.
</em><br>
<p>If I had any money to spend, I would spend it on lunar surface space
<br>
simulators on earth surface the size of a tennis court, flooded with
<br>
monster xenon lights to simulate full ~1.3 kW/m^2 insolation. I would
<br>
use this to develop fully autonomous and (with artifical relativistic
<br>
delay) teleoperated fabbing technologies for the Moon, plus onion
<br>
rubber skin space suits (in electroheated loose kevlar coveralls) you
<br>
can actually work in.
<br>
<p>Once the stuff has been debugged, optimized and debugged ten times
<br>
over, I would send the compacted result to the Moon in few 10 t
<br>
increments, and (tele)operate it 24 h/day to autoamplify the
<br>
bridgehead as fast as possible, inventing new fabbing tricks along the
<br>
way. Did you know that as of this month you can now make solid
<br>
titanium (V,Cr and alloys) regulus directly by electrolysis from pure
<br>
oxide cathode dipped in liquid calcium chloride electrolyte? Don't you
<br>
think that melting regolith to glass in situ with a parabolic foil
<br>
mirror and sputtering doped semiconductors on top of it will make nice
<br>
cheap solar cells? How to keep the mirror surface clean? How about
<br>
polymerizable inflatable structures you can bury under rubble? And how
<br>
to generate rubble, electromagnetic hammers? Wouldn't it be
<br>
interesting to know how to efficiently get out the tighly bound
<br>
hydrate water out of polar regolith? How to make efficient cryotraps
<br>
by shading off reservoirs? Where to find volatiles, and carbon?
<br>
Whether solar ovens can do quantitative fractional destillation of
<br>
lunar soil? How to do preparative mass spectroscopy?  Or do we just
<br>
apply juice to a molten soil puddle?  Using electrodes made from what?
<br>
How to insulate high-voltage capacitors for lunar mass drivers in a
<br>
vacuum?  How do you do ebeam material processing? Won't the local
<br>
vacuum become too dirty in no time? How to make semiconductor-grade
<br>
silicon in a simplified process?  How to make open power vacuum tube
<br>
electronics?  Phased array microwave power radiation facilities?
<br>
Gossamer solar sails? Carbon truss cloth which can survive linear mass
<br>
driver launch? How to bake out 3-He and implanted solar wind hydrogen
<br>
from regolith?  How to make sustainable underground ecologies? &lt;insert
<br>
10^9 tricks and technologies I omitted&gt;. We have to reinvent our
<br>
entire processing technologies, refitting them for space and
<br>
tele/autooperation. It will be a gigantic challenge, provide
<br>
unimaginable spinoffs and yield unprecedented wealth.
<br>
<p>This will also initially cost us hundreds of gigabucks before
<br>
producing break-even revenue stream, but this will bring us
<br>
sustainably nigh-zero-casualty into space, without exposing idiotic
<br>
canned monkeys planting purely symbolic insignia on a remote, cold
<br>
ball of dirt shrouded in thin carbon dioxide/argon atmosphere which we
<br>
don't have to mine yet. Mars will be ours in its due time. Don't
<br>
spread too thin resources we don't have.
<br>
<p>Don't all these fscking space visionaries have a shred of common
<br>
sense? Pfaugh.
