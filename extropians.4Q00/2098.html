</em><br>
<p>That part, at least, isn't a problem.  Attach the address label with Post-It
<br>
glue, then take the address label off after it arrives, then write the &quot;real&quot;
<br>
address on the envelope.  They're making Post-It gluesticks, so the same
<br>
method can be used to seal the envelope if you don't want to just tuck it in. 
<br>
Then you just drop the back-postdated envelope into someone's mailbox, or
<br>
(you'd need an inside guy for this) into someone's heap of uncounted absentee
<br>
ballots.  This assumes that postmarks don't have routing information.
<br>
<p>No, it's not my Chicagoan blood showing through.  It's just that I feel that
<br>
votes won't be secure until they come up with a way to use PGP signatures. 
<br>
Better yet would be if the cryptomagic folks come up with a way to
<br>
double-blind the votes, as with some of the proposals that have been floated
<br>
for untraceable, non-double-spendable digital cash.  An ideal crypto election
<br>
system would have the following properties:
<br>
<p>1)  All votes - that is, the digital information representing votes - are
<br>
posted publicly.
<br>
2)  Anyone can independently count the votes.
<br>
3)  Anyone can independently verify the identities of the registered voters.
<br>
4)  Anyone can verify that their vote is represented in the count.
<br>
5)  Nobody can trace my own vote back to me.
<br>
<p>You'd need some fancy prime numbers to handle that.  It would probably work
<br>
something like this; I create my voting slate; I perform an operation which
<br>
blinds the data in my voting slate; I send my blinded vote to the election
<br>
commission (this occurs in full view of everyone); the election commission
<br>
signs my blinded vote using the universal Election Private Key and sends the
<br>
signed, blinded text back (also in full view); I decrypt the signed vote in a
<br>
way which leaves the plaintext signed; I post the vote data to a repository
<br>
through some anonymous means.
<br>
<p>Anyone should be able to independently examine and count the plaintexts of the
<br>
votes; anyone should be able to verify that their personal vote appears in the
<br>
public repository; the votes themselves should be untraceable; finally, the
<br>
number of signatures performed by the election commission is a matter of
<br>
public record, as are the identities of the individuals who sent in blinded
<br>
votes.  (The total number of signed plaintext votes should be less than or
<br>
equal to the number of publicly signed blinded votes, unless the election
<br>
commission is pulling something.)
<br>
<p>Somebody has probably thought this through before.  Are there any papers on
<br>
this already out there?
