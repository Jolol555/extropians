<p>Ah!  Spoken like someone who has never actually experienced *any* of those
<br>
things.
<br>
<p>My mother tells a whopping good story about the air-raids, SS troops, Red
<br>
Army soldiers, refugee trains, starvation, dysentery, playing with
<br>
unexploded munitions, POW camps, and other facts of her childhood.  She
<br>
was one of the lucky ones.  Sometimes she can even sleep afterwards.
<br>
<p>The only thing my grandfather *ever* talked about that happened prior to
<br>
1945 was the time he went to see Herman Oberth give a lecture.  It always
<br>
horrified me to watch him eat...after all those years, he still wolfed it
<br>
down like he would never eat again.  Literally licked the plate clean.
<br>
Sometimes afterward I could sleep.
<br>
<p>My other grandfather carried a BAR in the Pacific.  Never talked about it
<br>
either, other than mentioning once that he could still smell burning
<br>
flesh.  He could sleep after a quart of scotch.
<br>
<p>Even I have stories.  Listening to gunfire late at night on the East
<br>
German border.  Tripflares and land-mines exploding, straining to tell if
<br>
you could hear screams. T-72 tanks rumbling in the dark.  That electric
<br>
shock you feel when you realize that Hind helicopter flying by doesn't
<br>
have rocket launcher pods but instead has nerve gas dispensors. Years
<br>
later turning on the TV and seeing people gleefully climbing over the
<br>
Berlin Wall.  I wept like a baby. 'Course I had it soft, never got shot
<br>
at.  Never even missed a meal.
<br>
<p>Oh, yes.  Great stories.  Even lived to tell them.
<br>
<p>Can't say much for the philosophies that made them, though.
<br>
<p>Can't say much for you, either.
