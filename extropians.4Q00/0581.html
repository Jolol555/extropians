<p>
Extropes,
<br>
<p>Let me be blunt.  In the face of all the cultural hostility and long
<br>
standing prejudices, coercive supression, loud machismo vanity, and
<br>
atavistic bullying, a rather simple and straightforward explanation has
<br>
been clouded and shunted out of plain view.
<br>
<p>Homosexuals are superior.
<br>
<p>Ever notice how many of the great, and greatest of the great, artists,
<br>
scientists--I am confident re these two fields of human endeavor.  I will
<br>
leave it to others to add to the list: (military men?, ...?)--are and have
<br>
been gay?  Intellectually, it seems that homosexuals have substantial
<br>
abilities.  Combine the best of feminine and masculine cognitive talents,
<br>
perhaps?  Testosterone and estrogen extremists are, perhaps, intellectually
<br>
challenged, having, in a sense, only half a brain?  Chuckle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Timothy Leary wrote: &quot;Since homosexuality has always been a part of every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society, you have to assume that there is something necessary, correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and valid - genetically natural - about it.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Does anyone know of any studies --you know, science stuff-- done to compare
<br>
statistically the intellectual or academic achievements of regular vs extra
<br>
fluffy?
<br>
<p>I am myself too much of an underachiever to qualify as gay, though I am
<br>
quite proud of, and endeavor at all times to empower my feminine side.
<br>
--Remember Jael from the bible, first among the women of her tribe.  Clever
<br>
warrior she.  Didn't brag or posture, just delivered the goods.  Deadlier
<br>
than the male.--  As a child, I was surrounded by strong capable women,
<br>
intellectually and emotionally.  Women have always seemed to me to be
<br>
superior to men, except in the area of overt aggressiveness.  And since
<br>
lesbians start out as women, and gay men have a sort of feminine component
<br>
added on, both cases look to be a kind of *upgrade*,  you know, as in from
<br>
coach to first class.
<br>
<p>Men are loud and boorish because they have to be, lest their self-esteem
<br>
suffer in light of their self-evident deficiencies.  But buck up, guys.  We
<br>
have penises, we have sperm, they have to let us play.  (For a while yet
<br>
anyway.)
<br>
<p>As this analysis is less than scientifically rigorous, allow me to throw in
<br>
this URL in support of my thesis:

<br>
<p>Thank you.  Have a nice day.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just because it's hard, doesn't mean you know
<br>
how to do it.&quot;
