Adrian, I think that we've both made our points without email 
<br>
nitpicking semantics and needlessly fine points of the argument.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I think the main problem is that you thought he was pondering on what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is, while he was really addressing what is perceived as being and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that can/should be manipulated to bring about changes in what is.
</em><br>
<p>There definitely might have been a misunderstanding in the points 
<br>
that he was trying to convey.  I think that my interpretation was 
<br>
more reflective of the actual text, but maybe you have pre-existing 
<br>
knowledge of his position, or identify with him in some other way. 
<br>
Maybe I'm just being deliberately obtuse and belligerent. :)
<br>
<p>If you're correct, I'm hoping he'll be a little clearer and logical next time.
<br>
<p>Thanks for the thoughtful discussion,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
