<em>&gt; &gt; I'd disagree with that- to what end does the individual in question take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; astrology seriously?  For what purpose?  What practice?  What do they do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with it?  I would never trust a doctor who made treatment assumptions
</em><br>
based
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; upon my sun sign, but an artist who uses it for inspiration is another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; matter entirely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, sure, but you can get the same inspiration by pouring different
</em><br>
color
<br>
<em>&gt; paint in your toilet bowl and pulling the lever. Such is not a matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believing it as valid fact.
</em><br>
<p>That's the difference between a hermetic qabalist and a chaos mage... of
<br>
course, many among the latter believe that truth is a matter of who creates
<br>
it (which just brings us back to the Berkeley Refutation...)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Anyone who claims to be a green in any sense ought to be taken out in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wilderness and dropped there naked. If they walk out after 6 months, I may
</em><br>
begin
<br>
<em>&gt; to take them seriously. 99% of them I doubt would make it. When you are
</em><br>
freezin
<br>
<em>&gt; your butt off, the motto no longer is 'you pack it in, you pack it out',
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; becomes 'fuck it, burn it'. When your processed grain trailmix with exotic
</em><br>
dried
<br>
<em>&gt; fruits from four different continents runs out and you are reduced to
</em><br>
eating
<br>
<em>&gt; wild onions, asparagus, and acorns, you'll track down, jump, strangle,
</em><br>
gut, cook
<br>
<em>&gt; and eat any animal you come across, no questions asked.
</em><br>
<p>What does that have to do with the Green Party platform?  Absolutely
<br>
nothing.
<br>
<p>Let's see... the Greens support equal redistribution of wealth, an increase
<br>
in localization and community self-reliance, fighting for equal civil
<br>
rights, better regulated international trade, the development of clean and
<br>
sustainable sources of energy, the promotion of mass transit and
<br>
neighborhoods constructed for pedestrians instead of cars, a woman's right
<br>
to reproductive choice, the promotion of small scale organic agriculture
<br>
over industrialized, chemical agriculture, Native American sovereignty, and
<br>
waste reduction programs.
<br>
<p>In other words, the future that I think most Greens envision is not one of
<br>
wilderness survivalism, but one of a technological ecotopia reminiscent of
<br>
the Earth seen on Star Trek... in other words, a progressive, holistic view
<br>
in which we begin to focus on what is really important in life, instead of
<br>
what corporations tell us, and where advanced technology intermingles with a
<br>
clean, healthy planetary ecosystem.
<br>

<em>&gt; &gt; (I tried, for six months, to embrace Libertarianism.  I just couldn't do
</em><br>
it-
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm far too compassionate (and I have too little faith in human nature)
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oddly, the worst atrocities on mankind were committed by people who had
</em><br>
too
<br>
<em>&gt; little faith in human nature. Trusting someone beyond reason is the only
</em><br>
way to
<br>
<em>&gt; achieve results beyond hope. Most people tend to live up to the standards
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; expect of them. Think about it.
