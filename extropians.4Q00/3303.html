<em>&gt; &gt;Rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While I agree that you've expressed the underlying philosophy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarianism:  If we are relying upon a plurality of American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voters to get on board for the sake of one simple (albeit logical and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paramount) idea, we're doomed.
</em><br>
<p>Not if that idea is the fundamental core that the rest derives from. 
<br>
Without stating upfront and most importantly what the core is the rest
<br>
is just a bunch of platform planks like the people are fed up with
<br>
hearing.  
<br>
<p>As Rand used to put it, one doesn't bargain about degrees of poison. 
<br>
Saying Libertarians want smaller government is phrasing your message in
<br>
terms of degrees of poison.  It will not move anyone.  Saying you are
<br>
for a laundry list of things implied by basic principles but not stating
<br>
the basic principles opens the list to derision and cooptation until
<br>
only the thinks that look like lunancy to the majority without the basic
<br>
principles being understood are left.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Developing a plurality in American politics requires forming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coalitions of people interested in different party planks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarians need the cooperation of the pot heads, the gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enthusiasts, the gays, the entrepreneurs, the pro-choicers, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They're not going to all buy into the underlying principle (at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not at first), but they'll at least give us their consideration if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advertise the party planks that they like.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  But unite them on what is truly fundamental.  Show them that what
<br>
they want flows directly from fundamental principles and can only safely
<br>
be build on them.  And reach past these few to the average Joe in the
<br>
street and tell him what these principles will do to make his life
<br>
better and by how much.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One of the things that I personally *love* about the LP is how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positions on the favorite issues of all of those groups can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logically and easily obtained from the guiding principle that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioned above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yeah?  So why the hell isn't the party campaigning upfront and foremost
<br>
on that instead of the half-assed mealy mouthing of recent campaigns
<br>
that brings in a tiny fraction of a percent of the vote?  
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Sure they will &quot;entertain&quot; a reduction in how much of your money the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;will steal in order to take away more of your rights than they have any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;intention of acknowledging, much less protecting.  The Republicans will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;never, ever, reduce their drain on the economy enough to undermine their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;own favorite tyrannies against the American people they claim to serve.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree to an extent.  However, after we've achieved what we can by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working from within one of the dominant parties, I'd much rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fight a Republican-dominated government that has a tax (and power)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; base of 1x than a Democrat-dominated government that has a tax (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power) base of 2x or 3x.  Plus, the subsequent battle with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Republicans will be about repealing &quot;tyrannical&quot; laws.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsequent battle with the Democrats will be about taking away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entitlements.  In general, the former is easier to accomplish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You can acheive nothing from working within one of the dominant
<br>
parties.  The dominant parties reflect the dominant sickness in this
<br>
country's political system.  You can't cure it by becoming infected with
<br>
it and becoming involved in spreading the sickness.  Don't dilute
<br>
medicine with the poison killing the patient. 
<br>
<p>There is no reason to believe that the Republicans will ever reduce
<br>
government size by your implied 50% or better relative to Democrats. 
<br>
Historically there is no basis for such a pipe dream.  On principle
<br>
(they haven't any) there is no basis.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Creating a new and valid political party in this country that will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of competing with the Republicrats will be extraordinarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult - especially when you consider that Libertarians don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those purely emotional core groups like the Democrats have minority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups and the Republicans have religious groups.  I'm helping where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can, and I support the Libertarians where I can, but realistically,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that I'm more likely to see some of the issues I'm looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for addressed by the Republicans.
</em><br>
<p>Will the job get any easier if we continuously play footsie with those
<br>
who seek and are actively engaged in the destruction of freedom?  
<br>
Looking at individual issues one by one without standing strong on
<br>
underlying principle is what got us into this mess in the first place. 
<br>
If we ever want something better then we have to do something different.
