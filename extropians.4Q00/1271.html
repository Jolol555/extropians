<p><em> &gt; To be clear to all listening, one of my main points as this is *not* the

&nbsp;
<br>
Of course, we both are probably totally wrong. It's not that we're
<br>
going to go to interstellar seed any time soon.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; my model.  Specifically they are how fast resources available can grow
</em><br>
<em> &gt; at an &quot;oasis&quot;, how much seeds cost as function of their speed and hardness,
</em><br>
<p>Resources growing at an oasis? The matterenergy concentration in a
<br>
given solar system is constant. You can rearrange matter so that you
<br>
maximize available energy flux utilization, or even tinker with the
<br>
rate of matter to energy conversion. But the total resource
<br>
concentration is finite. Or are you talking about new solar system
<br>
formation? I'm not sure colonists will allow such a thing. Hydrogen is
<br>
probably too useful to be wasted on stellar object formation.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; and what the seed mortality rate is as a function of their speed, hardness
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and distance traveled.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
What is the probability of a penny-crossection meeting something
<br>
larger than a micron dust grain in transit? Interactions of
<br>
relativistic matter is nasty, it doesn't matter much whether this is
<br>
0.1, 0.5 or 0.9 c. You have to send a lot of the seeds (you can't
<br>
focus the spot well enough anyway), make the individual seeds
<br>
distributed (multiple level redundancy), maybe send ahead skimmers.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; My model says that a selection effect at the leading edge selects for
</em><br>
<em> &gt; pioneers who do not stay.   So the big question is how strong this
</em><br>
<p>Inoculate an infinite agar plate. Step back a couple of lightminutes,
<br>
and wait until the front will arrive. Look just behind the wave. Are
<br>
you going to see sterile substrate after wave front? Fat chance.
<br>
<p>Staying is default. The launchers can't launch themselves, so they
<br>
stay. Sustainable barrage of stellar neighbours with seeds is a waste
<br>
of resources after they're infected, so they'll cease.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; selection effect can be in moulding the preferences and strategies of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; colonists.
</em><br>
<p>I think one half of your assumptions is faulty: yes, the selection
<br>
effect is very strong, resulting in convergent evolution of expansion
<br>
wave front organisms and no, they do not leave sterile substrate in
<br>
their wake.
