<p>Sitting on the fence does little but give you splinters in your ass, and
<br>
make you a sniper target for both sides. A flexible mind posesses the
<br>
ability to make up one's mind at some point, preferably before the end
<br>
of time. A notorious fence sitter is as rigid of mind about refusing to
<br>
decide as any partisan is about decisions made.
