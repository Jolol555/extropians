<p><em>&gt; Microsoft issuing a profits warning. The editor of Business Week publishing
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I'm interested to know what the economists on the list think is going on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I've certainly seen the belief, &quot;it'll never happen&quot; expressed here before.
</em><br>
<p>I'll admit that in the heady months leading up to the beginning of the 
<br>
present slump in the stock market I was beginning to be tempted to wonder &quot;Is 
<br>
this it?  Is this the beginning of the REALLY sharp upturn of The Spike?&quot;  I 
<br>
know a lot of other people had the same feelings and a few even expressed 
<br>
those feelings.  Now, many months into what's clearly a major downturn in at 
<br>
least the capital markets for technology-related developments, such thoughts 
<br>
seem pretty naïve.
<br>
<p>I think the truth is to be found by stepping back and thinking again about 
<br>
how major historical changes look on large and small scales.  That we're 
<br>
experiencing a downturn in one (albeit important) aspect of the social 
<br>
implementation of new technologies doesn't mean that the over-all trend of 
<br>
the present time isn't a significant acceleration of the basic business and 
<br>
technology cycle.  However, it does mean that we have to be careful when 
<br>
thinking about the fine scale of such a phenomenon.
<br>
<p>On an issue-specific small scale, what happened between 1997 and the first 
<br>
quarter of 2000 was a &quot;gold rush&quot; brought on by an exponential growth in 
<br>
AWARENESS of the Internet and its potential.  That same &quot;aha&quot; feeling that 
<br>
many transhumanists report having when the major elements of our world-view 
<br>
click into place happened on at least one front for a snowballing proportion 
<br>
of the investing public over a fairly short period of time, fueled by the 
<br>
media's self-referential feedback of a few simple ideas about how business 
<br>
methods would be effected by advancing network technology and the 
<br>
Ponzi-scheme possibilities of geometric growth in stock values in a few 
<br>
easily identified sectors of the capital markets.
<br>
<p>Had we really been in the first stages of a true technological singularity, 
<br>
this runaway inflation would have been self-sustaining: The influx of capital 
<br>
would have fueled technological development into real products with real 
<br>
economic value fast enough to maintain the building momentum.  Obviously this 
<br>
didn't happen on the scale required.  A collapse of stock values was thus 
<br>
inevitable as absurd P/E ratios came to be seen as the naked emperor they 
<br>
were.  The fact is that much of the inflation was based on investment in 
<br>
companies with no realistic business plan that were only proposing a fairly 
<br>
slight revision of existing business methods: Most of the &quot;e-tailors&quot; were 
<br>
developing enterprises that promised in reality only a slight increase in 
<br>
efficiency in a market segment that is inevitably characterized by small 
<br>
margins on high volumes of trade in existing products.
<br>
<p>A major question - yet to be answered - is whether the personal experience of 
<br>
having been burned in this pyramid scheme will create an intermediate-term 
<br>
brake on the willingness of investors to back REAL technological innovation 
<br>
that promises REAL revolutionary profit potential.  On a large scale, I think 
<br>
we ARE seeing real increases in economic productivity arising from 
<br>
synergistic interactions of the basic technological innovations that are a 
<br>
basis of the transhumanist world-view.  The fundamental value of the insight 
<br>
we all share - that advances in information technology fuel a positive 
<br>
feedback loop with molecular biology, other medical technology, materials 
<br>
science and robotics - is still there.  However, we certainly and obviously 
<br>
haven't reached a stage in which the specific instances of that feedback 
<br>
function operate in a completely continuous and &quot;smooth&quot; fashion.  On a fine 
<br>
scale, the operation of that synergy is still episodic and &quot;jerky&quot;.  
<br>
<p>Individuals who overextend themselves financially in this environment will 
<br>
get burned - some quite badly.  However, I maintain my conclusion that 
<br>
investment in the long term growth of economic values created by innovative 
<br>
technologies is the best course.  This means picking investments that are 
<br>
aimed at creating real economic value by significantly improving efficiency 
<br>
in areas that are known to be highly valued by large segments of the 
<br>
population.
