<p>Not necessarily.  Suppose he was copulating with another gay mantis.
<br>
After sex, the receptor mantis would devour the head of his companion.
<br>
The notion of gay mantises lends an entirely new meaning to the term
<br>
&quot;giving head&quot;.
<br>
<p>{8^D  sorry couldnt resist that one.

<p>After quietly listening to the exchange on this topic, I submit this notion:
<br>
that there is some yet unknown mechanical/genetic explanation for
<br>
homosexuality that is a completely random event.  It comes from inheriting
<br>
the genital configuration from one parent and the sexual orientation
<br>
from the other, and that the probability of this is about 5% regardless
<br>
of other factors.  I have had gay friends tell me they were gay since
<br>
as far back as their earliest memories, cases where twin boys were
<br>
raised identically as far as anyone could tell, yet only one is gay.  It
<br>
must be something genetic, decided at the moment of conception.
<br>
<p>It is easy to see how societies with gays would have advantages
<br>
over those that do not, however the above notion would suggest
<br>
that *all* human societies have about the same percent gay, therefor
<br>
no group selection advantage there.  spike
