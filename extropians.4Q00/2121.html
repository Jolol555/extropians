There has been considerable work in the cryptographic community on
<br>
anonymous voting schemes.  Most of them have some disadvantages, and
<br>
there are difficulties in marrying the cryptographic technology
<br>
to the real world of voters, registrars, county recorders and such.
<br>
<p>I know a guy who works at votehere.net, one company which is promoting
<br>
a cryptographic voting system.  They have some descriptions of the
<br>
technology at <a href="http://votehere.net/VH-Content-v2.0/gettingtechnical.html">http://votehere.net/VH-Content-v2.0/gettingtechnical.html</a>.
<br>
This is from <a href="http://votehere.net/VH-Content-v2.0/whitepapers/primer.html">http://votehere.net/VH-Content-v2.0/whitepapers/primer.html</a>:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The privacy of individually verifiable election systems [FOO92, PIK93,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cra96, Sch95] comes from blind signatures. Blind signatures [Cha81]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are a class of digital signatures that allow a document to be signed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without revealing its contents. An often used analogy is that of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;placing a document and a sheet of carbon paper inside an envelope. If
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;somebody signs the outside of the envelope, the carbon paper transfers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the signature to the document on the inside of the envelope. The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;signature remains on the document when removed from the envelope.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically, a voter blinds and digitally signs his voted ballot and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;submits it to a verifying authority. The voted ballot also contains a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unique serial number generated by the voter. Once the voter submits the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blinded vote to the verifier, the verifier checks the voter's digital
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;signature and voter eligibility. If all criteria are met, the verifier
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;checks the voter off the voter roles, countersigns the voted ballot,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sends the blinded, countersigned ballot back to the voter.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voter removes the blinding encryption layer revealing the verifying
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authority's signature. Now that all voter specific information
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is removed from the ballot, the voter submits it to the tallying
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authority through an anonymous channel. An anonymous communications
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e.g., onion routing) channel protects the message with multiple
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;layers of encryption using randomly selected intermediate points (see
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[SGR] for a discussion of onion routing). The tallying authority
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authenticates the verifying authority's digital signature and adds
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the results to the tally.
<br>
<p>The VoteHere system is actually quite a bit more sophisticated than
<br>
this, but even so there are problems.  Some of these are shared with
<br>
any non-poll vote, like absentee ballots.  For example, you can sell
<br>
your vote by letting someone watch you vote.  There are also issues of
<br>
electronically authenticating voters and making sure they are eligible.
<br>
Many of the same old frauds will still work, such as padding the voter
<br>
lists with dead or imaginary voters.
<br>
<p>There is some discussion of electronic voting in the
<br>
Risks digest at <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/21.11.html">http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/21.11.html</a> and
<br>
<a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/21.10.html">http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/21.10.html</a>.  One of the links from there
<br>
is to <a href="http://avirubin.com/e-voting.security.html">http://avirubin.com/e-voting.security.html</a>, which emphasizes
<br>
the insecurity of home computer systems, bringing a risk of fraud and
<br>
manipulation.
