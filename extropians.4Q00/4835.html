<p>To my knowledge, they're mainly theoretical and proposals, but there
<br>
are no laws-of-physics barriers to their completion.  The main problem
<br>
is money (and its subset, politics): unlike $1, one must come up with a
<br>
compelling business case to get people to spend $1 billion.  So far, no
<br>
one has done so and followed it through to the point of actual
<br>
construction, though there are, of course, merely large buildings in
<br>
many densely populated areas (and off-shore, if one counts oil rigs and
<br>
the like).  This may be due to the fact that buildings have
<br>
historically not been high-return ventures, so anyone who is in general
<br>
Aware Of Future Tech can easily get more money for their time - short
<br>
and long term - in other fields.
<br>
<p>(I know that I, for one, am affected by this.  Silicon Valley, where I
<br>
live, could use a just-offshore arco to ease its residential pressures,
<br>
and it has plenty of engineering talent for cool projects like this,
<br>
and it has plenty of VCs to fund something as provably long-term
<br>
profitable as this, yet getting it built is not currently worth the
<br>
large amount of my time I'd have to spend.)
<br>
<p>A quick Metacrawler search on &quot;arcology&quot; turns up many hits, for
<br>
instance <a href="http://www.arcology.com/">http://www.arcology.com/</a> (though that's far from the best hit
<br>
in the results; it's just a page of mostly-dead links).
