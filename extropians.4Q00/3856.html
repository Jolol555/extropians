<em>&gt; Yes, I know.  I thought about putting in a comment about that, maybe even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claiming that it made it &quot;harder to tell&quot;, but that would have been a dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; giveaway that I knew you were born on January 19th, 1982.  It's much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eerie if I appear to &quot;guess&quot; you're a Capricorn.  Right?
</em><br>
&lt;cut&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Damn, blew it again.  Oh, well... more books you like include &quot;Hermetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Magic&quot;, &quot;The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying&quot;, Dostoevsky's &quot;Crime and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Punishment&quot;, and &quot;Foundations of High Magick&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>I was starting to figure that you had just looked up Quantanephilim on
<br>
amazon.com, and read my book reviews... I went on a review-writing binge
<br>
last summer- most of the reviews were rather poor and ill-thought out,
<br>
however (but still better than most that are posted!).  And I was sure that
<br>
I had panned &quot;Foundations of High Magick&quot;...  I'll have to look that one up
<br>
again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I currently don't have anyone feeding me information.  Everything you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen so far, I did on my own.  I considered trying to contact a roommate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at St. Thomas to find out the name of your cat, but that would be too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trouble.  I do need to draw the line somewhere.
</em><br>
<p>He'd probably have known.  I assumed that you knew I was at St. Thomas due
<br>
to the account that I'm subscribed under, but I didn't know how much info I
<br>
had on myself availiable online.  Perhaps your way (write your whole life
<br>
story, all your interests, etc.) is better than letting people pick things
<br>
up piecemeal... (by the way, I enjoyed your story... very inspirational.  It
<br>
reminded me of my own experiences, going through the public schools that had
<br>
little to nothing to offer me, trying to stay out of the social games,
<br>
studying science, programming computers, and cranking out copious amounts of
<br>
bad literature while the other students played sports and struggled through
<br>
mathematics... and then, in my teen years, facing the fact that despite what
<br>
the test scores say, I don't know how to do much of anything.  I more than
<br>
understand, to say the least.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *You* have to stop feeding *me* additional information, though, or this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all gets much less impressive - what do you think this is, a palm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading?  Saying that you chat on #thee_vortex really takes the impact out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my calling you &quot;an eighteen-year-old chaos mage&quot;, which, by the way, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knew beforehand, but too late now.  Likewise with the &quot;on the cusp&quot; line,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which blew the January 19th bit, forcing me to use the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; date-of-birth for verification.  I was saving it for later.  Sigh...
</em><br>
<p>Palm reading, how quaint!  Anyway, I had pretty much figured it out by now.
<br>
