<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Didn't Russell and Whitehead show that 'logic' supplied the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rules underlying both mathematics and language in Principia
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mathematica ... maths is purely logically, and cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;proven by science empirically.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>How do you know?
<br>
If you want to resist philosophy, then stop thinking about that question 
<br>
right now, you'd need philosophical concepts to answer it.
<br>
<p>Isn't logic a subset of philosophy? It was in the philosophy department at 
<br>
my college. I'm sure you know Russell was an academic philosopher.
<br>
<p>Philosophy suffers the same problem AI does. Once you solve the problem, 
<br>
it's not considered philosophy anymore. Philosophy is the fertilizer, the 
<br>
brainstorming room. The best results from there (and it takes a sometimes 
<br>
millenia to get them) are then passed on to the appropriate department. You 
<br>
might be surprised to find that Descartes (&quot;I think therefore I am&quot; is what 
<br>
he's most famous for) wrote extensively on meteorology, mechanics, 
<br>
physiology, etc. Aristotle wrote extensively on biology, Plato on 
<br>
government. The first debates about atoms were held among philosophers in 
<br>
Ancient Greece. Pythagora (spelling?), who discovered the Pythagorian 
<br>
theorem and many other facts about numbers, had a cult of philosophy 
<br>
students whose behavior was in some respects more bizzare then the Heaven's 
<br>
Gate castration comet suicide cult. Newton was considered a philosopher who 
<br>
solved the greatest philosophical problem of his time, the motion of the 
<br>
planets. The reason that the field of philosophy has narrowed so much over 
<br>
the past few thousands of years is that it has been so successful. It's 
<br>
solved so many of its problems that they can now be dealt with by 
<br>
non-philosophers.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, see above, mathematics IS a subset of logic.
</em><br>
<p>Which is a subset of philosophy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It seems to me that all theory is philosophy, and the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;method converts theory (possible fantasy) into fact (provable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;reality).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You are stretching the term &quot;philosophy&quot; to a ludicrous extent.
</em><br>
<p>When you think &quot;philosophy&quot;, think &quot;pre-natal science&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A question for you defenders of academic philosopher: name
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just one (real world, useful) problem solved by philosophy in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the past 100 years? Or name a single theory universally agreed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by academic philosophers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Are you suggesting that universal agreement is equivalent to truth? It's 
<br>
not. There are a number of problems I consider &quot;solved&quot; which are not agreed 
<br>
upon at all. For example, the question of the purpose of life, the question 
<br>
of whether God exists, and the question of what is the value of truth.
<br>
But, for philosophy problems solved with general agreement in the past 100 
<br>
years, Quantum and Atomic Physics answered (partially) questions asked 
<br>
thousands of years ago by Atomism. Calculus (I'm going back a few hundred, I 
<br>
know) gives the tools to mathematically solve problems about time and motion 
<br>
posed thousands of years ago by Zeno. Eventually, (some) questions about 
<br>
consciousness will be answered by the departments already starting to take 
<br>
it over from philosophy and do empirical research, which is psychology. It 
<br>
would be pointless to go through the entire list, you could buy books worth. 
<br>
Almost any mid-level book on science is going to start with a chapter about 
<br>
the philosophers of Ancient Greece who first posed the problems you're about 
<br>
to read the solutions to.
<br>
You're looking for problems which have been solved to the satisfaction of 
<br>
experts, but which are still considered philosophical problems, but this is 
<br>
impossible by the definition of &quot;philosophy&quot;, for reaons outlined above. 
<br>
Once it's put in a way that allows it to be addressed by empirical or 
<br>
mathematical methods, it's no longer considered philosophy. It can take 
<br>
thousands of years and thousands of philosophers to reach that point. Would 
<br>
you criticize the value of Kindergarden by asking &quot;name a single useful book 
<br>
written by or invention invented by a Kindergardener&quot;, well, none while they 
<br>
were still in Kindergarden.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And just a quickie on &quot;transhuman&quot; philosophy ... please can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we drop  the P word and just have particular topics ... unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we are going to have a fully Posthuman school of philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that reduces and supersedes the failed human-legacy schools.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am yet to be convinced that transhuman thought is any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than a waiting room for the posthuman world. The convergence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;singularity&quot; might never happen, so why not get on with establishing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;posthuman society now? Human, conventionalist philosophers have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;failed to engage with the public ... I can think of none who is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;house-hold name or who has any particular wisdom to convey to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the common masses ... academic philosophy is turgid and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unimportant. Or am I missing something?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the &quot;common masses&quot; are not a gague of anything.
<br>
Can you name a single transhumanist who is a household name, who can engage 
<br>
with the public more then any academic philosopher? Does that mean it's 
<br>
turgid and unimportant?
<br>
Can you name any biochemist who is a household name?
