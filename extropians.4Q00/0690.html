<p>Well you obviously have a lot of company, as long threads continue on
<br>
about how AIs will explode in intelligence, and no one yet seems to think
<br>
my position plausible enough to be worth offering an argument against it.
<br>
<p>I find it striking that people seem to think that the speed and nature of
<br>
learning is one area where AIs will be very different from humans, even
<br>
though they seem to think AIs will be similar in so many other ways,
<br>
including having consciousness, wanting to squash bugs, being unable to
<br>
clearly articulate their goals, etc.  In contrast, I think that while many
<br>
other details can differ a lot, the speed and nature of learning is not
<br>
one of them.  Yes, maybe AIs can redesign their hardware and low level
<br>
code, but I don't see that giving big wins after the first easy wins are
<br>
taken.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  My current hypothesis for what is causing the Flynn effect is based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the kind of sexual selection that is described in The Mating Mind. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;claim that women alter the importance they attach to intelligence in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mate selection in response to changes in the relative importance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligence as a measure of a man's ability to earn a reliable living.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The industrial and information revolutions caused an increase in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;importance of mental abilities (especially the ability to handle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;abstractions) and a decrease in the importance of alternative measures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such as physical strength. We should expect this to cause an increase in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolutionary pressure for increased intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>Most observers don't think there has been enough time for selection to
<br>
have much changed intelligence over the last century.  And your hypothesis
<br>
seems to me the opposite of the Mating Mind idea as I understood it.  I
<br>
thought the ability to earn a living was mainly just taken as a signal
<br>
of the fitness of your genes.
