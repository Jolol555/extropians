<em>&gt; It would be interesting to see a male v female breakdown on state and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; federal crime statistics per se. Not to say that the general state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those (completeness, accuracy, standards, etc.) is anything to be proud
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of. After the numbers were up, we could make claims about how they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seemed skewed.
</em><br>
<p>That might be interesting. Even more interesting (to me) is the fact that while
<br>
women commit most of the child abuse in the US, almost all of those in prison
<br>
for this crime are men.
