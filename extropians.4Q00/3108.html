<p>
Michael Lorrey cites a number of grounds for questioning the limits of
<br>
the 16th Amendment.
<br>
<p>Since this whole topic came up, I've done a little more reading.  I am
<br>
not a lawyer, but I bounced a couple of questions off a law student.
<br>
This is however, not legal opinion, just some random discursive
<br>
thoughts on the topic.  Let me take the points one by one:
<br>
<p>1. Some of the arguments are based on the idea that the amendment was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not properly ratified.  I've not seen the evidence, but whatever it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is is presumably part of public records.  Everyone who pays income
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taxes has had a tremendous interest in seeing them nullified for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decades, but there's been not much progress in that direction.  It
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seems that barring a wealth of new evidence, the overwhelming
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;success the government has had in getting acceptance that the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amendment was ratified will not be reversed.  It's been almost a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;century.  It would probably be easier to repeal the amendment than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to get it nullified on such grounds, in my humble opinion.
<br>
<p>2. The definition of income.  The amendment says, &quot;incomes, from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatever source derived&quot;.  I suspect that many ordinary citizens
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who might otherwise be allies in seeking to nullify the income tax
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on these grounds, agree with the Libertarian Party on this: they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aren't interested so much in judicial theories as in what the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;plain language&quot; seems to say.  Naturally, this may sometimes be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controversial and misleading, but in this case, if income were
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meant to have a narrow definition, the term used is colossally
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;misleading.  Even if it is meant that way, again, the long history
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of interpreting it the way it is now extends back nearly a century
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and has been well accepted.  As long as there is any room for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doubt, I suspect the plain language to be so persuasive that most
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people will willingly grant the government the benefit of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doubt.  Again, I think it would simply be easier to get the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amendment repealed than to win the argument on these grounds.
<br>
<p>3. Yet another argument is that there are loopholes which the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amendment doesn't cover, such as one established by a really old
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case cited in the article.  I suspect this to be a mirage,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;essentially.  My guess is that the case history on many laws
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contains some conflicting or inconsistent opinions.  It's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unsurprising that the opinion that seemed to find a loophole was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very old.  By now, I suspect one would meet with near unanimity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the courts in rejecting such arguments.
<br>
<p>4. Finally, there is an argument that the code itself makes payment
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voluntary.  Again, I wouldn't be surprised if there are portions of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the code that seem to say that -- it's gigantic.  However, as with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the case law, though there may be inconsistencies, I expect the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;courts are not going to accept such a questionable exemption, or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else wouldn't many wealthy people routinely be paying no income tax
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on those grounds?  If their tax advisors thought they could get
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away with it, the wealthy people would.  If anyone is getting away
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with it, I suspect it's because the number of people and amount of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;money in question is small.
<br>
<p>If people get away with not paying income tax, I'm happy for them.  I
<br>
think taxation is theft.  I pay my taxes because I can't afford the
<br>
risk, and I don't expect the courts or our society really to respect
<br>
any arguments on these grounds.  I think it would be easier to get the
<br>
16th Amendment repealed than to win widespread respect for these
<br>
questionable loopholes.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
James Wetterau
