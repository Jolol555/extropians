<em>&gt; &gt; Extropy doesn't mean negentropy.  Extropy is a normative term; entropy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is a physical variable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, extropy means &quot;the extent of a system's intelligence, information,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order, vitality, and capacity for improvement.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://extropy.org/extprn3.htm">http://extropy.org/extprn3.htm</a>

<p>Entropy SYMBOLIZES heat death, chaos, homogeneity, things running down
<br>
until they break, etc.  But it's only a physical variable.  No
<br>
extropian actually opposes the increase of physical entropy.  We
<br>
oppose the increase of entropic ideas, of things running down until
<br>
they break, of homogeneity.  We endorse spontaneous order (which is
<br>
really a series of physically entropic processes) and, if we need to
<br>
bother, preventing universal heat death.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But, more generally, adopting transhumanism generally tends to provoke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather strong views about what society should look like.  While
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extropians envision society with increasing extropy, there are a heck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of a lot of transhumans who are technocratic, socialist, fascist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; liberal democrats, conserative republicans, etc.  (This is not name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; calling; most of those who are, for example, transhuman fascists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; self-identify that way.)  Calling these views extropic is misleading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at best.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If &quot;extropians envision society with increasing extropy&quot; it seems to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that view can include transhumanism. Rather than misleading, I think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calling the views of transhumanists extropic helps to establish some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common ground, and it also helps to update whatever paradigms attach to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old, established ideologies such as you list. In simplistic terms (I like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reductionism), entropy correlates to death and dying; while extropy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corresponds to life and living. Extropians can define extropy any way we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to, obviously. I just think it's more extropic to include
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism than to exclude it. Personally, I find both transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and extropianism to be more extropic than anything else except dhyana (a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sanskrit word roughly translated as meditation).
</em><br>
<p>No, this misses the point that transhuman fascists, for example, are
<br>
in no way extropic, not even by virtue of the fact that they support
<br>
transhumanism.
<br>
<p>If you must nitpick, I suppose they're more entropic than luddites,
<br>
but that's really not saying very much.
<br>
<p>Transhumanism without a commitment to extropy is just transhumanism.
<br>
This can turn into an extropic society, or it can turn out in a
<br>
dystopic socialist nightmare.
<br>
<p>Consider, for example, the Nazis, &lt;dum dum dum, discussion ends&gt; many
<br>
of whom would self-identify as transhuman fascists.  In a possible
<br>
Nazi future, the Aryan technocratic elite would live forever, and the
<br>
rest of us would be enslaved or crushed.  But just because the Aryan
<br>
elite would use High Tech to live forever doesn't mean that a Nazi
<br>
future would be anything close to extropic.  And they'd hardly mind
<br>
that.  As far as they're concerned, extropy is dumb.
