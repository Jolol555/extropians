<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;POPE SCHMOOZES WITH FASCIST SYMPATHIZER, DENOUNCES EVILS
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OF &quot;ATHEISM, SECULARISM, INDIVIDUALISM&quot;
<br>
<p>As thousands of demonstrators poured into the streets of Rome in
<br>
protest, the Vatican confirmed that Pope John Paul II will go ahead
<br>
with plans to meet tomorrow with Austrian far-right political leader
<br>
Joeg
<br>
Haider.
<br>
<p>Haider arrived this afternoon in Rome, and was promptly escorted to a
<br>
private hotel near the Vatican under heavy police security.  His visit
<br>
with the pontiff, slated for Saturday morning, comes as tension rises
<br>
between Italy and Austria over statements made by Haider critical of
<br>
Italian policies on immigration.
<br>
<p>Haider, who has said that he admired many of the policies of Nazi
<br>
dictator Adolph Hitler, is former leader of Austria's far-right
<br>
Freedom Party which is now a junior partner in that nation's coalition
<br>
government.  Earlier this week, he denounced Italian President Carlo
<br>
Azeglio Ciampi for his liberal attitudes on permitting the free flow
<br>
of immigrants throughout the region.
<br>
<p>&quot;As an Austrian politician, I have my position on immigration,&quot; he
<br>
told journalists during a walking tour near the Vatican.  &quot;President
<br>
Ciampi is allowed to have a different one.  It's not my problem.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Vatican has been under fierce criticism ever since news broke
<br>
several months ago that Haider was to be part of an official
<br>
delegation from Carinthia which is presenting the Holy See with this
<br>
year's traditional Christmas tree for St.  Peter's Square.  The
<br>
protests have resulted in a cordon of security guards around the
<br>
80-foot-high conifer.
<br>
<p>Holocaust survivors, Jewish organizations, World War II partisans, and
<br>
diverse political groups are charging that the Vatican meeting
<br>
legitimizes a man frequently compared to Hitler.  Thousands of
<br>
demonstrators marched through Rome last night, and then assembled on
<br>
the Capitoline Hill for a moment of silence in protest against racism.
<br>
Italian Labor Minister Cesare Salvi greeted the gathering, and was
<br>
joined by Center-right opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi, who
<br>
distanced his party from Haider's ideas.
<br>
<p>The Holy See's decision to follow through on the meeting between the
<br>
pontiff and Mr. Haider has been a lightening rod for critics who see
<br>
the Vatican as unwilling to distance itself from odious sympathizers,
<br>
and take responsibility for its past wrongs.  Earlier this month, for
<br>
instance, the Vatican asked U.S.  authorities to intervene and dismiss
<br>
a lawsuit naming it as a party in aiding Nazi expatriates at the end
<br>
of World War II, and hiding gold and other valuables expropriated from
<br>
victims of the clerical fascist Ustashi Catholic government in the
<br>
former
<br>
Yugoslavia.
<br>
<p>Coincident with the flap over Haider's visit to the Vatican, the Pope
<br>
received Croatia's new ambassador to the Holy See, Franjo Zenko, and
<br>
denounced the various dictatorships the country had suffered for most
<br>
of the 20th century.  The papal platitudes, though, ignored the fact
<br>
that the Vatican aided the Ustashi regime, and supported Croatian
<br>
strongman Franjo Tudman who presided over the country from 1991 until
<br>
his death last December.  John Paul II has also taken criticism for
<br>
his beatification of the late Archbishop Stepanic, who represented the
<br>
Vatican's interest in Croatia during the time of the Ustashi regime.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Common Cause With Haider: Pope Denounces Evils Of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Atheism, Secularism, Individualism&quot;
<br>
<p>Haider's reception at the Vatican coincides with another precisely
<br>
timed development, namely the early release of an official statement
<br>
criticism globalism and the Western emphasis on individual rights.
<br>
Although originally scheduled for publication on January 1, 2001, the
<br>
Vatican Press Office released copies of &quot;Dialogue Between Cultures for
<br>
a Civilization of Love and Peace,&quot; which marks the New Year's
<br>
celebration of World Peace Day.  An Associated Press release noted
<br>
that the statement was being &quot;sent to world leaders two weeks early.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is a typical John Paul oration, scolding the world's nations for
<br>
emphasizing values at odds with the Vatican agenda.  The statement
<br>
includes much of the language used by political observers to describe
<br>
the emergence of a post-cold war world characterized by more
<br>
diaphanous national boundaries, global trade and communications,
<br>
emphasis on consumerism, and a growing stress on individual rights and
<br>
choices in the cultural and economic marketplace.
<br>
<p>The harshest language is reserved for notions which the Vatican has
<br>
found increasingly more dangerous and pervasive -- secularism, Atheism
<br>
and individualism.  In a hit at Western affluence, the statement
<br>
declares:
<br>
<p>&quot;The radicalization of identity which makes cultures resistant to any
<br>
beneficial influence from outside is worrying enough; but no less
<br>
perilous is the slavish conformity of cultures, or at least key
<br>
aspects of them, to cultural models derived from the Western world
<br>
view.  Detached from their Christian origins, these models are often
<br>
inspired by an approach to life marked by secularism and practical
<br>
atheism and by patterns of radical individualism.  This is a
<br>
phenomenon of vast proportions, sustained by powerful media campaigns
<br>
and design to propagate lifestyles, social and economic programs, and
<br>
in the last analysis, a comprehensive world-view which erodes from
<br>
within other estimable cultures and civilizations.&quot;
<br>
<p>Western materialism and cultural paradigms were described as &quot;enticing
<br>
and alluring because of their remarkable scientific and technical
<br>
case,&quot; but Christians were admonished that &quot;there is growing evidence
<br>
of their deepening human, spiritual and moral impoverishment.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The culture which produces such models is marked by the fatal attempt
<br>
to secure the good of humanity by eliminating God, the Supreme
<br>
Good...&quot;
<br>
<p>The emerging global &quot;culture industry&quot; is excoriated as well, and this
<br>
latest statement is not the first the Vatican has made expressing its
<br>
displeasure with the ability of movies, music and other entertainment
<br>
forms to erode religious cultures and mock sectarian beliefs.  &quot;These
<br>
products include and transmit implicit value-systems and can therefore
<br>
lead to a kind of dispossession and loss of cultural identity in those
<br>
who receive them.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hijacking Issues
<br>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church has emerged as a major player (if not the
<br>
leader) on the international scene in a loosely knit movement of
<br>
sectarian and social groups, and nation states linked by a cluster of
<br>
concerns having to do with modernity and globalism.  These issues can
<br>
cover the gamut from environmental concerns to issues like migration,
<br>
economic development, and problems which often emerge in the
<br>
dislocations of social change.  At a recent United Nations forum on
<br>
family planning and population, for instance, the Vatican joined with
<br>
several Asian and Latin American countries heavily influenced by
<br>
Catholicism, and Islamic states in attempting to torpedo resolutions
<br>
supporting birth control and demographic restraint.  The &quot;Dialogue
<br>
Between Cultures&quot; points to similar Vatican concerns over &quot;the value
<br>
of life,&quot; and the Holy See's war on abortion rights for women,
<br>
liberated sexuality and issues like euthanasia and biogenetic
<br>
technologies.
<br>
<p>The pontiff speaks of a &quot;tragic spiral of death which includes murder,
<br>
suicide, abortion, euthanasia, as well as practices of mutilation,
<br>
physical and psychological torture, forms of unjust coercion,
<br>
arbitrary imprisonment, unnecessary recourse to the death penalty,
<br>
deportations, slavery, prostitution, trafficking in women and
<br>
children.&quot;
<br>
<p>The linkage of these practices betrays a distinct Vatican agenda.  The
<br>
pontiff continues:
<br>
<p>&quot;To this list we must add irresponsible practices of genetic
<br>
engineering such as cloning and use of human embryos for research,
<br>
which are justified by an illegitimate appeal to freedom, to cultural
<br>
progress, to the advancement of mankind.&quot;
<br>
<p>Those who disagree are not part of the &quot;civilization based on love and
<br>
peace&quot; supposedly advocated by the Holy See.
<br>
<p>So far, there has been little coverage of the document in the American
<br>
or European press.  The themes are not new ones, though, and are even
<br>
hauntingly familiar, especially when examining the agenda of the
<br>
National Conference of Catholic Bishops.  In 1997, for instance,
<br>
AANEWS observed the common ideological themes in the rhetoric of Rev.
<br>
Sun Myung Moon, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, and Catholic
<br>
prelates.  Indeed, at a gathering of hundreds of bishops from North
<br>
and Latin America held in Rome in 1997, we noted the words of Rev.
<br>
Donald Wuerl of Pittsburgh who told his fellow clerics that &quot;Heavy
<br>
emphasis on the individual and his or her rights has greatly eroded
<br>
the concept of the common good and its ability to call people to
<br>
something beyond themselves...&quot;
<br>
<p>The Bishops went on to denounce the fact that &quot;In our democracy,
<br>
divergent political viewpoints are more often resolved by the facile
<br>
reliance on the rule of the majority than by a genuine discernment of
<br>
what is best for the common good.&quot;  One bishop described abortion and
<br>
physician-assisted suicide as &quot;unspeakable crimes&quot; which are &quot;embraced
<br>
in the name of individual rights and democracy.&quot;
<br>
<p>Haider and the pope may disagree on many issues; but they also have
<br>
common cause in their mutual distrust of globalism, &quot;too much freedom&quot;
<br>
and the lack of subordination of the individual to a higher calling,
<br>
be it authoritian politics or doctrinaire religion.  The Vatican also
<br>
realizes that Haider may have a future in the European political
<br>
scene.  Rarely does the Holy See ignore an opportunity to &quot;dialogue&quot;
<br>
with powerful political leaders.
<br>
<p>In the meantime, the Vatican's latest statement on Atheism, secularism
<br>
and individualism underscores its political agenda throughout the
<br>
world, and in the United States.  With a new president about to be
<br>
sworn in, the Holy See may well consider George W.  Bush -- like
<br>
Mr.Haider -- a political asset and ideological ally.
