</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does this really follow, logically?  Why stop there?  Your labor belongs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to you, products of it belong to you, things you touch belong to you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who see the products of your labor belong to you, the universe

</em><br>
<em>&gt; rule of logic tells us where to stop?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry Hal, but that is a rather ridiculous extrapolation, with no
<br>
connection to the situation whatsoever.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saying that you own yourself is one thing, although it's not 100% clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what that means.  At least you are a tangible object; saying that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;thus&quot; own your labor is less well defined (labor is merely a pattern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of activity, something which is questionable to speak of owning).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But to go from there and say that you own the products of your labor is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely unjustified, unless these products emerge directly from your body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and I doubt that anyone will fight you over those products).
</em><br>
<p>The value you add through your labor belongs to you. Is that better?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In practice, to make products, you need raw materials.  And if you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to own those products, you better have owned the raw materials.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But now your logical flow is completely disrupted.  You tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show how you could come to own physical objects by starting with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical premise that you own yourself.  However, you also have to assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you already owned certain physical objects (the raw materials).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hence you have not built a system of property rights upon a foundation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of self ownership.  You had to assume owned property already.
</em><br>
<p>No, you don't. You could assume that natural resources are community
<br>
property. If the community chooses to sell that property to individuals,
<br>
that is its right, but once sold in an agreeable exchange, that is now
<br>
private property. The fractional added value to raw materials that an
<br>
individual's labor belongs to the individual providing the labor,
<br>
exchanged under mutual agreement with the owner of the raw materials.
<br>
Also involved are tools used by the laborer, and the value of the
<br>
greater productivity the tools provide when combined with the knowledge
<br>
and skill posessed by the laborer in their use is split between the two.
<br>
Given all this, a capitalist free market results.
