<p>Agreed.

<p><em>&gt;IMO the real effect here is that we prefer situations in which our

</em><br>
<p>This is an interesting hypothesis, worth exploring.

<em>&gt;There is nothing you can do to change the past so it doesn't matter what

<em>&gt;you think of it, unlike the future.  ...
</em><br>
<p>It might matter that you anticipate how you will feel later about actions
<br>
taken today.  And these preferences might be a side effect of other
<br>
evolutionary pressures.  But I agree that it is far from obvious how
<br>
evolutionary pressures would produce such preferences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't agree that this effect can be aptly described as &quot;tastes changing

</em><br>
<p>Their terminology is standard, and to me completely reasonable.
<br>
<p>Why don't you just bite the bullet and tell us that their theory doesn't
<br>
describe your preferences?  How much are you willing to spend today to
<br>
give yourself in ten years $1 more to spend then, and how much would you
<br>
be willing to spend today to give yourself ten years ago $1 more to spend
<br>
then, assuming we could arrange a time machine to implement this choice?
