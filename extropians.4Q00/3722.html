<p>
There is a line of argument in this &quot;consciousness&quot; debate, which sometimes
<br>
becomes explicit, which is this:
<br>
<p>&quot;Consciousness doesn't matter; it probably doesn't even exist. There is no
<br>
consciousness, so no problem of consciousness.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is an appealing argument, because it steps around some pretty major
<br>
technical difficulties.
<br>
<p>But it begs the question, that if consciousness isn't, and a copy is the
<br>
original in all functional senses, then what is the point of uploading, or a
<br>
quest for immortality, or anything, really?
<br>
<p>If you personally want to be immortal (or indefinitely long lived, anyway),
<br>
you are making a statement about yourself. If consciousness isn't, if your
<br>
self isn't, then what is it that you are trying to preserve? Your
<br>
description? A state of the universe where some being traceable back to your
<br>
original DNA is alive? Why?
<br>
<p>If there is no self, what is the motivation to defeat death, on a personal
<br>
level, and continue? Why is personal preservation more important than, for
<br>
instance, the preservation of the species? Why wouldn't you support research
<br>
which would create DNA for an indefinitely lived next generation, rather
<br>
than uploading, where you are trying to preserve the current generation?
<br>
Isn't the quest to make future generations long lived far easier to attain
<br>
than that to preserve existing (and crumbling) phenotypes?
<br>
<p>Dennetites, who are also for life extension, what is your motivation?
<br>
