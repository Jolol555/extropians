How would you run a pro-technology campaign against the eco-fascists? Oooh! 
<br>
Did I say that? A decent meme, no?  Perhaps also a mention of the Ebola 
<br>
virus, and note that, it too, is 100% natural! Point out that no community 
<br>
today is powered by Photo-voltaics, for example,  ( I am in favor of 
<br>
Photovoltaics) and that we must spend billions on high tech systems to 
<br>
produce and store solar energy, for year-round energy use, in all climates. 
<br>
<p>Let the Rocky Mountain Institute (Amory Lovins) design such a system and then 
<br>
market it. I bet there are a lot of people who might like to lower their 
<br>
energy bills imported from the utilities. If he cannot do this, then maybe 
<br>
there is something wrong with the physics that we require, or that the 
<br>
technology to accomplish this has been so under-estimated as to put it 
<br>
somewhere along inter-planetary colonization, to achieve it?
<br>
<p>Emphasize the idea that the more high-tech, the less the poverty. That better 
<br>
technology is far kinder to the environment, but that someone has to 
<br>
physically create such new technology. Let people know that the Greens are 
<br>
not intellectually capable of this. Hardly an engineer among em'! 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Feh! I spit on the front porches of these eco-schmucks Ha-tooh!!!

<p>&lt;&lt; Here's something from one of the radical green lists I monitor:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt;Attitudes to protect you against the one-sided information onslaught:
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt;1.  Since most of what we are told about new technology comes from its
</em><br>
<em> &gt;proponents, be deeply skeptical of all claims.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;2.  Assume all technology &quot;guilty until proven innocent.&quot;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;3.  Eschew the idea that technology is neutral or &quot;value free.&quot; Every
</em><br>
<em> &gt;technology has inherent and identifiable social, political, and 
</em><br>
environmental
<br>
<em> &gt;consequences.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;4.  The fact that technology has a natural flash and appeal is meaningless.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;Negative attributes are slow to emerge.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;5.  Never judge a technology by the way it benefits you personally. Seek a
</em><br>
<em> &gt;holistic view of its impacts. The operative question is not whether it 
</em><br>
<em> &gt;benefits
</em><br>
<em> &gt;you, but who benefits most? And to what end?
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;6.  Keep in mind that an individual technology is only one piece of a larger
</em><br>
<em> &gt;web of technologies, &quot;megatechnology.&quot; The operative question here is how 
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em> &gt;individual technology fits the larger one.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;7.  Make distinctions between technologies that primarily serve the
</em><br>
<em> &gt;individual or the small community (e.g., solar energy) and those that 
</em><br>
<em> &gt;operate on a scale
</em><br>
<em> &gt;outside of community control (e.g., nuclear energy). The latter kind is 
</em><br>
<em> &gt;the major
</em><br>
<em> &gt;problem of the day.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;8.  When it is argued that the benefits of the technological lifeway are
</em><br>
<em> &gt;worthwhile despite harmful outcomes, recall that Lewis Mumford referred to 
</em><br>
<em> &gt;these
</em><br>
<em> &gt;alleged benefits as &quot;bribery.&quot; Cite the figures about crime, suicide, 
</em><br>
<em> &gt;alienation,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;drug abuse, as well as environmental and cultural degredation.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;9.  Do not accept the homily that &quot;once the genie is out of the bottle you
</em><br>
<em> &gt;cannot put it back,&quot; or that rejecting a technology is impossible. Such 
</em><br>
<em> &gt;attitudes
</em><br>
<em> &gt;induce passivity and confirm victimization.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;10. In thinking about technology within the present climate of technological
</em><br>
<em> &gt;worship, emphasize the negative. This brings balance. Negativity is 
</em><br>
positive.
<br>
<em> &gt;
