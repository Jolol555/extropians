<em>&gt; Amazon also lists your reviews as being &quot;from Sioux Falls, SD&quot;, by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way.
</em><br>
<p>I was well aware of this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Pity.  I guess there's no point now in implementing the rest of my master
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plan.
</em><br>
<p>This has taught me a valuable lesson, however- having a distinctive name (as
<br>
well as distinctive handles) is a double-edged sword.  You sacrifice
<br>
anonymity for uniqueness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your birthday is also listed in the #babygoth data, by the way, and one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the neqroteqh email addresses was used by an &quot;Anton MacDonald&quot; for some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posts.  (I'd actually managed to miss your earlier post in which you'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explained that &quot;nicq&quot; was short for &quot;Nicholas&quot;.)
</em><br>
<p>Yup.  As I guessed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just making your life a little more surreal.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you- you had me going for a little while.  I was trying to guess where
<br>
you pulled Anton out of, at the very least- but you were totally off
<br>
regarding my relationship with my mother, unless you consider chemistry sets
<br>
and the &quot;Sim&quot; game series &quot;macho toys&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have a couple of other comments on things you said or thought at some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point during your entire lifespan:  There is a difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality and rationalization.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are people who can &quot;prove anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with logic&quot;, who use their intelligence simply for justifying what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already want to believe, but this itself is not an intelligent act, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least not if done deliberately.  Those who fail to understand this are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; script kiddies of rationality.  You have not achieved proficiency in logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until logic can tell you something you didn't expect to hear - until logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is dictating to you, and not the other way around.  I judge moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophies the same way; you have not achieved proficiency in morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until your philosophy takes over and tells you something you don't want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear.  Of course, that doesn't mean that just telling you *anything*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpleasant means you're doing things right... but if all you hear is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you want to hear, you'll never get anywhere.
</em><br>
<p>I'll agree with that as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Judging proficiency in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logic is rather easier; logical reasoning has to tell you something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you didn't start out expecting, and then the logic also has to be right.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the reasons I don't like magic-based philosophies, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nihilism-based moralities, is that they appear to have no capability to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used in a way that surprises the user.  Personally, in addition to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nicolai Kingsley stories, I think you should also read &quot;The Moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Animal&quot;.  (You can skip &quot;Engines of Creation&quot;, since you've read that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already.  Sorry!  Just backsliding for a moment.)
</em><br>
<p>I just added it to my reading list.  Thanks for the recommendation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At least some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better magical philosophies prescribe mental training, awareness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness and the like - and I know you believe that's what's important,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the rituals - which tune abilities that can sometimes be turned to far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more powerful disciplines, such as evolutionary-psychology-augmented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-awareness.  But I advise you to start soon, since you're running out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of time.
</em><br>
<p>I'm well aware of the time constraints- as far as I'm concerned, I have
<br>
twelve years to complete my training for whatever comes next.  Of course, I
<br>
may have more or less time- but I'm not going to push it too far.  It's time
<br>
for me to get to work.
<br>
