</em><br>
<p>You think so?  The memetic programming has been effective then.
<br>
<p>I suspect the military flag was so heavily favored for two reasons.
<br>
First, in the early days of the US, flags would not have been
<br>
displayed that commonly.  The people had no need for constant memetic
<br>
reinforcement of their country.  Second, few people realize that the
<br>
insipiration for the US flag was the East India Company's flag, which
<br>
had the bars horizontally.  The major innovation in the US flag was
<br>
the &quot;new constellation&quot; in the pennant, where formerly the Union Jack
<br>
had flown.  Evidently the East India Company flag is still the flag of
<br>
the state of Hawaii.
<br>
<p>You can see the flags here:

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Union Jack and Stripes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of the origin of the Stars and Stripes, the American flag,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;forms an essential part of every schoolchild's education in the United
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;States, but it is not commonly known that the inspiration for Betsy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose's gift to Washington was the flag of the East India Company,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which consisted of a Union Jack and stripes. Even now the state flag
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of Hawaii is the same as the East India Company's flag -- a memorial
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to the Company's involvement in the voyages of Captain Cook, who was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to die there. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colonies lost and won
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Two events marked the low point of the Company's involvement with the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fledgling independence movement in the American colonies. One, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;infamous Boston Tea Party in 1773, was a direct result of the drawback
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the government in London of duties on tea which enabled the East
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;India Company to dump excess stocks on the American colonies, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;acted as a rallying point for the discontented. The other, the defeat
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of General Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781 resulted in American
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Independence; Cornwallis himself was later to serve with great
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;distinction in the Company's service in India, and it was said of him
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that whilst he lost a colony in the West, he won one in the East. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the East India Company brought new goods and fashions to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Europe, America was never far behind. The light cottons of India were
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;well-suited to the humid summers of the South Eastern states, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;calicoes, chintzes, silks, spices, coffee, cocoa and Chinese
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;earthenware as well as tea all found their way across the water,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mainly shipped by private traders from the Company's warehouses in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;London. Even after Independence the East India Company remained a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;highly competitive importer of goods into the United States, resulting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in occasional flare-ups such as the trade war between 1812 and 1814. 
<br>
...
<br>
<p>I particularly note the description of the war of 1812 as the &quot;trade
<br>
war between 1812 and 1814&quot;.  That little business of burning the White
<br>
House and the Capitol was just a by-product of nasty trade conditions.
<br>
<p>This underscores the importance of commercial advantages to the
<br>
independence movement.  Whether it was the prominence of the East
<br>
India company in their thinking, its symbolic importance as an
<br>
explorer for the &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; and the involvement of such
<br>
notorious and famous figures as Captain Cook, Henry Hudson, Lord
<br>
Cornwallis, Captain Kidd, and Elihu and Thomas Yale (foundational
<br>
benefactors of Yale College) with the company's exploration, a hope
<br>
for freer markets, or a snub to British charters of monopoly, I still
<br>
think the flag's origins are quite remarkable.  And even more
<br>
remarkable is how few US citizens know their flag came from a British
<br>
company.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
