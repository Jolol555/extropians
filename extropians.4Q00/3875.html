<em>&gt;  &gt; My brain has been replaced atom by atom my whole life.  Pretending
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  that there's a real difference if it happened much faster or even all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  at once would seem to be an intellectual dishonesty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Definitely no.  Damnit Chris, why do you have to pull this &quot;intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dishonesty&quot; stunt again?
</em><br>
<p>I'm just a bad boy that way.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Of course there's a real difference.  As we've repeatedly stated, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;substrate doesn't matter-- you can replace every neuron in my brain with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;synthetic one, and I'd be as pleased as punch, as long as you do so in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fashion that preserves my original reality experiencer.  In your prior post,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you -had- correctly identified the nature of the disagreement-- why are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;falling back to this position now?
</em><br>
<p>There's no &quot;falling back&quot;.  Just because I understand our core 
<br>
disagreements doesn't mean that I think that they're both rational. 
<br>
Actually, neither is rational.  That same post that you mentioned 
<br>
also admits to the irrationality of my own position.  I called it a 
<br>
&quot;sentimentality&quot;, but it amounts to the same thing.
<br>
<p>Your position is irrational in thinking that there's an original 
<br>
&quot;consciousness&quot; that is permanently destroyed in the process.  Mine 
<br>
is irrational in thinking that the continuity of my original or my 
<br>
copy matters at all.
<br>
<p>Pick your favorite flavor of irrationality and enjoy.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
