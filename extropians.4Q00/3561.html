I also spoke of &quot;success&quot; in rather round terms. Nobody really knows how
<br>
good a job Google (for instance) really does; the joke at Google, I am
<br>
told, is that Google indexes 1,326,920,000 pages, or zero percent, of
<br>
the Web (:)). It seems to be good enough, and it's far from useless.
<br>
<p>I don't think there were any &quot;experts in this field&quot; in 1990. There were
<br>
a bunch of people doing their best with what they had to hand. You are
<br>
free to disagree. I was at the HyperTEXT '87 conference in
<br>
Raleigh-Durham, and there were a whole lot of knowledgeable people
<br>
betting on what a pragmatist like Emlyn in 2000 would probably call the
<br>
wrong horses.
<br>
<p>It turns out that, among its other failings, Xanadu was ironically too
<br>
&quot;central&quot; a model to take off, plus, this was before the Open Source
<br>
approach was accepted; the sprawl and chaos of the Net was able to
<br>
muddle through to what we have now.
<br>
<p>At least we don't have to explain why anyone would want hypertext any
<br>
more.
