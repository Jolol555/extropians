<p>I don't think thats a real concern. I think the concern is becoming

<p>Depends on whether the Chicago mob retirees are able to steal this one
<br>
too. Considering how most military ballots are being rejected in over a
<br>
dozen Florida counties, typically due to lack of postmarks (which are
<br>
not used by the military mail systems in many locations like Bosnia,
<br>
Kosovo, and on board ships) or voter information (like how many of us
<br>
have our Voter ID numbers memorized?), as well as the number of felons
<br>
(90%+ of whom are democrats) who illegally voted (one of whom is a poll
<br>
worker!), and the number of Bush votes that have been found in Gore
<br>
stacks, I would not be surprised if Gore pulled it off, even though Bush
<br>
has won every recount so far. Despite an overwhelming majority of
<br>
Americans saying Gore should concede, I don't think he's man enough to.
<br>
They know this administration will be a key one for the future of the
<br>
republic, and are pulling out all the stops to win it one way or
<br>
another. Gore also knows if he loses he is likely to come under
<br>
investigation from a GOP appointed Attorney General for fundraising
<br>
abuses. Being President and picking your own AG is the best kind of
<br>
immunity.
