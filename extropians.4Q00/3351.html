</em><br>
<p>These are the two most common positions I've observed among
<br>
intellectually mature libertarians.  Libertarian claims are taken to
<br>
either be statements of fact or of value.  If they are statements of
<br>
value, then it appears that most people just don't share those values,
<br>
and so a &quot;moral revolution&quot; is required to give people the &quot;right&quot; values.
<br>
<p>If they are statements of fact, and if current libertarians have been
<br>
convinced by being presented with clear evidence in their favor, then
<br>
the fact that most other people, even very smart ones, are not
<br>
convinced when they are presented with such evidence, suggests a vast
<br>
conspiracy of strong stupidity.
<br>
<p>I think that there are large differences in value at play here, and
<br>
think the prospects of a moral revolution in the libertarian direction
<br>
anytime soon to be small, and similar in magnitude to prospects of
<br>
moral revolutions in opposite directions.
<br>
<p>I also think that there are differences about facts at play here, but
<br>
that the evidence is subtle and difficult to communicate, and hence
<br>
doesn't actually explain very much of the reason why some people become
<br>
libertarian.  And there is, alas, also vast stupidity out there.
