<p>Well, my feeling still is that MacLeod's method is exactly to explore a
<br>
variety of normative and emotional responses to these issues, and in his
<br>
different books (and even within them) he deploys different readings,
<br>
variant understandings, changing attitudes. The particular evil horror
<br>
uploads you mention are explicitly a kind of botched first pass, as I
<br>
recall. More benign AIs are shown--I seem to recall that THE STONE CANAL is
<br>
*told* by one of them--and despite some prejudices against them they are
<br>
eventually accepted by humans (a human-centric perspective, it's true, but
<br>
then MacLeod and his readers are mostly humans). So the lessons you drew
<br>
might be misleading and too over-simplified even to meet your own purposes.
<br>
<p>Banks's implied Culture narrators, weirdly enough (black-comically
<br>
enough?), keep insisting at the top of their voices that Minds are
<br>
wonderful guys, incommensurably brilliant, beyond judgement by mehums - and
<br>
yet we can't help noticing that many of them are, after all, vilely
<br>
Machiavellian sonsabitches and not nice to know.
