<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I woke up yesterday morning feeling like someone had painted
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my tongue sometime during the night. I went and looked in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bathroom mirror; someone had painted my tongue sometime
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during the night. A sort of mottled creamy-pink matte
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finish. Arrrgle.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My finger-joints felt achy, my mouth felt like renovations
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were going on lower down in my throat, and I felt
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generally not entirely on top of the world. Wonder what
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the biological warfare people call this one, I thought,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;making aaah-noises and trying to see my tonsils.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Message on the answering machine. Nicole, from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sydney. I called her (Optus) and whined about how
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrible I felt. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know how you feel,&quot; she said. &quot;I had the same thing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last week. Aching joints, sore throat, itchy eyes,&quot; (my
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes started itching as she said this,) &quot;general weakness
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I need to lie down for a while.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You'll start coughing later this afternoon.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great. How did I catch this from you?&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She replied in a sing-song voice, &quot;Oh, you know, I gave it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Loki, Loki gave it to Megan ...&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;and Megan gave it to me. I was wondering where she'd
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gone.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, after the cough passes, you'll get intermittent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;headaches and dizzy spells ...&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let me write this down.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;and tomorrow, you'll wake up with a strange hankering
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to listen to early Duran Duran.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, the humanity!&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It gets better. After that, your overall mass will fluctuate;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll spend half the day flat out in bed, the other half
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;floating around near the ceiling. After that, general
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;synaesthesia - you see sounds, hear smells, feel colours,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that sort of thing ...&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now that sounds like fun.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Go shopping in that state. It's a lot easier than you'd
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;After that?&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She giggled, and murmured conspiratorially, &quot;You feel
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unbearably horny for about forty-eight hours. It begins
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to wear off after that, although you might have relapses
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the mass fluctuation. Carry some rope around with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you if you're going for a walk, and you'll be right as rain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in about five days' time. Oh, except for the ...&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Except for the what?&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She giggled again. &quot;Never mind. I think it's best if you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find out for yourself.&quot; Click.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, damn.
