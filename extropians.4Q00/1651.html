From: &quot;Nick Bostrom&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:nick@nickbostrom.com?Subject=Re:%20Fermi%20Paradox%20in%20the%20news&In-Reply-To=&lt;003f01c04050$0968d340$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">nick@nickbostrom.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Yes, if you thought that the improbability lay in the task of getting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suitable solar system together and that once you had the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constellation of planets etc then it would be easy for organic matter to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emerge and evolve into intelligent creatures.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think the improbability lies on the highest level-- we inhabit a
<br>
reality with physical laws that can give rise to intelligent life.  Any
<br>
further improbabilities below that level (class of sun, distance from gamma
<br>
ray bursts, planet with atmosphere, nominal gravity, etc, etc.) are the
<br>
purvue of hard science.  We can measure them.  We can form theories.
<br>
<p>In any case, I think I've said enough on the subject.  I think we'd require
<br>
a face to face conversation to achieve further mutual edification.  (Too
<br>
much immediate feedback required to steer these thought processes in the
<br>
right directions. &quot;No, wait, that's not what I'm talking about!&quot; etc.)
<br>
<p><p>So, let's talk about something else for a minute:
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; That reality begets observers might well be surprising. It depends on what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality is like. If things were set up in such a way that it would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been extremely improbable that any observers should have come to exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (imagine e.g. some cosmic fortune wheel that had to stop in a very
</em><br>
unlikely
<br>
<em>&gt; spot for life to emerge) then our existence would indeed be surprising. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is partly in order to avoid stipulating such a surprising contingency that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are leaning towards theories (such as multiverse theories)
</em><br>
according
<br>
<em>&gt; to which it would be much more probable that observers should exist.
</em><br>
<p>What I find sort of puzzling is the concept that somehow the variables
<br>
required for reality have the capacity to be selected for.  Scientists say:
<br>
&quot;Well, if this fundamental number was even -slightly- different, life never
<br>
would have come into being!  How extraordinarily unlikely!&quot; as if the
<br>
variable in question were being spit out by a mystical random number
<br>
generator somewhere-- as if it had the opportunity to be many different
<br>
numbers and by pure chance settled on this one.
<br>
<p>I have my thoughts on this, but let me ask: why is this an appealing way of
<br>
looking at reality?
