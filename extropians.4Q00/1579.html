<p>
Everyone here knows that the biggest problem for long term space travel, at 
<br>
least in our current biological state, is that the body begins to undergo a 
<br>
type of &quot;space rot&quot; in zero gravity, the muscles atrophy, the bones weaken, 
<br>
etc. This is most frequently mentioned as a serious barrier to a manned 
<br>
mission to Mars. On the ISS, astronauts will get two hours of excercise 
<br>
today. On Mir, and any shuttle mission, physical excercise is always 
<br>
practiced, and the astronauts are still phased when they return to Earth. 
<br>
These are missions of less then a year - missions in weightlessness lasting 
<br>
decades would probably kill us upon returning to a gravity environment. 
<br>
There needs to be some way to have the muscles in constant excercise, as 
<br>
they are here on Earth resisting gravity. Someone mentioned the idea of 
<br>
tethers, and correctly added that they will clutter up the craft. Here are 
<br>
some possible solutions I've thought of. Feel free to build on and implement 
<br>
them. I'll start with the worst ideas and move up. I'm sure science fiction 
<br>
authors have beaten me to most of these.
<br>
1. Have a constant downward air flow. Basically, the astronauts would live 
<br>
in a wind tunnel pushing them into the ground. They would need to excercise 
<br>
muscle power to stand against it. It would probably take a lot of power, 
<br>
would be noisy, and would require specialized ships (would not be portable), 
<br>
and it would be impossible to read a newspaper. Also, they would probably go 
<br>
deaf very quickly.
<br>
2. Have the ship filled with water, or some more viscous fluid. The 
<br>
astronauts would face some resistance just trying to get around because they 
<br>
would need to fight against the water. A downward flow, as in idea number 1, 
<br>
would assist too and give a direction to the artificial gravity. Drawbacks 
<br>
are that it would weigh the ship down a lot, and that they would need some 
<br>
way to breath, perhaps by suits or, in 25 years or so, by respiocytes which 
<br>
can leave their body to interface with the water and drawing out oxygen. The 
<br>
computer equipment would need to be water proof. A benefit is that the water 
<br>
could be drunk, and broken down by solar powered electrolysis to use for 
<br>
fuel, and it would provide some protection against radiation. It would need 
<br>
to be constantly cleaned, would require special ships, and is not portable.
<br>

<br>
3. Replace the force of gravity with the magnetic force. This was my first 
<br>
idea: somehow have the astronauts body have metal in/on it, either by 
<br>
attachments to his body (no more complicated then jewelry) or implanted in 
<br>
him. Possibly, devise some molecule which has an impermeable bio-friendly 
<br>
core, and is full of metal on the inside. Then megnetize the floor. The 
<br>
problem is that the megnetic force is very strong close up and very week far 
<br>
away. His feet would feel the effects but his head would still be in zero-G, 
<br>
unless he fell down. The effects would be no different then having a sticky 
<br>
floor. Then I came up with the idea of having it so that the astronaut has 
<br>
small electromagnets all over his body, and the floor is metal. The 
<br>
electomagnets would be able to sense how far they are from the floor, and 
<br>
adjust their magnetism to approximate the effects of gravity. The 
<br>
electromagnet on the soul of his foot knows it's less then a centimeter from 
<br>
the metal floor, so it is completely off. The one on top of his head knows 
<br>
it's far away so it would be on maximum power. If he falls over, each magnet 
<br>
on/in his body senses the approaching ground and adjusts its strength 
<br>
accordingly. The problems with this are that there would have to be 
<br>
extensive testing to find out the effects of having a super-powered magnet 
<br>
right next to your brain 24 hours a day - maybe there already is data on 
<br>
this, but I don't think it would be good for you. Also, I don't know if the 
<br>
electromagnets can be that strong and that powerful at the same time. The 
<br>
equipment may get heavy. The ships would have to be somewhat specialized: 
<br>
they could have no metal parts except for the strip on the floor. The 
<br>
computer equipment in the ship would need to be adapted to be resistant to 
<br>
the constant magnetic fields, hard disks at least would have to go and some 
<br>
slower alternative would have to be used.
<br>
4. The best one I've thought of is completely portable and do-able within 5 
<br>
years. There is a &quot;smart material&quot; called electroactive polymer. It has been 
<br>
proposed as an artificial muscle for robots or even artificial muscle for 
<br>
humans. It bends, in a muscle-like way, in response to a voltage applied to 
<br>
it. So my idea is, build a suit embedded with this stuff and have it react 
<br>
to your movements in such a way as to approximate the effects of gravity. 
<br>
When you lift up your arms, it senses the movement away from the ground, and 
<br>
applies a slight and calculated resistance, trying to pull your arms back 
<br>
down. This (and number 3) could be turned off with the flip of a switch in 
<br>
an emergency situation. When it's on, it might take some getting used to. I 
<br>
would think your movements would be kind of jerky, and until it's tested I 
<br>
wouldn't know how long it would take to get used to it, if ever. This one is 
<br>
completely portable and could be used on today's space shuttle. Another good 
<br>
thing about it is that it would have a direction of gravity, but that 
<br>
direction would not have to be the floor, it would just be whatever 
<br>
direction your feet happen to be facing, and you could still float. Here is 
<br>
a reference to the electroactivated polymer material:
