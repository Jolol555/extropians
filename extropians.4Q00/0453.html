<em>&gt; I do see the force of the claim, but it might still be wrong, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emergence of effective AI might, after all, depend on ramping up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrate technologies by brute force via Moore's law.
</em><br>

<p>Here's a very silly idea.
<br>
<p>You know how we like to speculate that we might not perceive &quot;real&quot; reality,
<br>
that in fact we might be software in some SI's sim? Imagine instead that we
<br>
are running on some very slow being's hardware (not exactly SI, but
<br>
advanced), as an autocatalytic feedback doover thingy. A universe sim with
<br>
the ability to kickoff life. The point of this being that they are trying to
<br>
build an SI in a box, to do their bidding. Not a bad job, they are almost
<br>
successful!
<br>
<p>Then, we get some inkling into the SI &quot;friendliness&quot; debate. Firstly,
<br>
they've got us running in isolation; we don't appear to have access to the
<br>
rest of their networks. Secondly, they are managing the friendliness thing
<br>
by pretending to be God. That would explain things like the millenia time
<br>
intervals between important religious events (that may be the time between
<br>
when they press &quot;enter&quot; for one command, wait for the terminal to echo the
<br>
result, then type in and press &quot;enter&quot; for the second command).
<br>
<p>Does this mean that the christians, et al, are the ones who've taken the
<br>
friendliness commandment to heart, and those of us who have rejected that
<br>
notion; well, we cop it in the next fitness evaluation round (ie:
<br>
armageddon, J R Molloy style)?
