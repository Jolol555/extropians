<br>
<p>If true, I wonder why frozen ovaries and frozen embryos are viable
<br>
with today's technology, but frozen eggs are not ??
<br>
<p>I know I've mentioned the topic of freezing eggs on the list before.
<br>
I can't think of a single issue more important to a woman in her
<br>
20's and 30's who is very actively persuing her interests and
<br>
finding she's successful, but can't find the time to raise a child.
<br>
<p>If you have not thought about this before, here are some
<br>
ramifications of freezing eggs as a way to postpone child-bearing.
<br>
<p>Young 20ish-age couples who postponed starting a family now have
<br>
more money and more time to devote to their careers.  A large number
<br>
of women who have one goal in mind- their careers- will be flooding
<br>
the marketplace. Companies catering to egg donors start a thriving
<br>
industry (another niche for Alcor, perhaps?). Businesses will now
<br>
have to accomodate older, more established, employees in their 40's
<br>
as they begin their new families. These same companies will find
<br>
that their younger employees are now more educated than they were
<br>
before. Congresscritters will pass new laws to try to get their
<br>
hands on the money being made in the new markets that spring up.
<br>
Women wanting the old traditional role will create a backlash
<br>
against those who want to freeze their eggs.  I see the social
<br>
ramifications as greater than that caused by women's birth control
<br>
pill.
