<em>&gt;  &gt; Is it still Thesius's ship? If no, at what point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; was it no longer that ship? When did it lose it's &quot;Thesius's ship&quot;-ness?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is still Thesius' ship. If you want to know how, observe the workers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;replacing the decayed boards with fresh boards. If you want to know when and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where, pay attention to these details. If you want to know whose ship it is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find Thesius' descendents and heirs. If you want to know why, you're a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosopher, and Thesius probably wouldn't want you on the ship.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree totally.  I think the philosphers are asking the exact 
<br>
right question.
<br>
<p>Is it still Thesius' ship?  There is no right answer.  The label of 
<br>
&quot;Thesius' ship&quot; denotes an ownership relationship that is not 
<br>
empirically provable.  The concept of ownership is philosophical.  It 
<br>
exists, not in reality or by science.  It exists by cultural 
<br>
agreement, by legal agreement, by linguistic terminology, or by other 
<br>
reference systems that we use for interaction between humans.
<br>
<p>In law, for instance, we would have to determine what the contractual 
<br>
agreement was for the workers to do all this work, and what they 
<br>
agreed to return to Thesius.  In all probability, the rebuilt ship 
<br>
was returned to Thesius as his property and the rotting ship was left 
<br>
with the workers as spare parts.  Can this be empirically measured? 
<br>
No.  Is there a chemical test we can perform, such as DNA matching, 
<br>
to see which is Thesius' ship?  No.  The question of nomenclature is 
<br>
merely a linguistic reference system that we use for communications. 
<br>
The question of ownership cannot be measured by science.  It must be 
<br>
logically deduced by linguists, lawyers, judges, and psychologists. 
<br>
Whatever we end up deciding becomes the right answer.  There is no 
<br>
objective measurable ownership particles that will lead us to the 
<br>
right answer.
