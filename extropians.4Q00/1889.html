<p>If this were a libertarian anarcho-capitalist society, then noise
<br>
rights would be settled ahead of time in some formal way.
<br>
<p>Perhaps they have, and the bar approves of a government like this.
<br>
Suppose, the rule of law is that you control your noise rights, unless
<br>
someone throws together a petition to stop you, in which case, you
<br>
lose them.  In this case, clearly, the bar does not entirely own its
<br>
noise rights.  If we assume that the bar approves of a government like
<br>
this, or if the government in question is a Nozickian &quot;government&quot;
<br>
consisting only of the set of PPAs and arbitratian agencies operating
<br>
in the area, (in which case, the bar has revealed preference for the
<br>
&quot;government,&quot;) then the answer is C.  The bar, if it so wishes, may
<br>
buy its noise rights from the citizenry at some fair price.  If it
<br>
refuses to pay this, then it's not best for the bar to operate here
<br>
anyway, since it's not willing to pay its own costs.
<br>
<p>If the rule of law is that the bar owns its own noise rights, and the
<br>
citizens approve of or reveal approval of the government, then, if the
<br>
petition has no effect, no force, no foul.  In that case, the answer
<br>
is C again, but in this case, the government refuses to do anything
<br>
about the petition.
<br>
<p>If the bar does NOT exhibit revealed approval of the government in
<br>
question, and if noise is not force, or if noise rights are up in the
<br>
air, then this could be a case of A.
<br>
<p>You've gotten no agreements to B so far because you phrased it wrongly
<br>
as far as libertarians are concerned.  The better way to phrase B
<br>
would be:
<br>
<p>(B') &quot;The citizens who signed the petition are not initiating force;
<br>
the bar initiated force by initiating noise and other negative
<br>
effects, and the citizens are forcefully retaliating.&quot;  If noise is
<br>
force, and the citizens have not approved of or given revealed
<br>
preference for the government, then the answer is B'.
<br>
<p>So:
<br>
<p>Disapproval = non-agreement and not revealing preferences in a
<br>
Nozickian &quot;government&quot;.
<br>
Noise = noise and all the other negative effects of a bar.
<br>
<p>Bar disapproves of government and noise is not force: A
<br>
Citizens disapprove of government and noise is force: B'
<br>
Otherwise: C.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  (A) Signing a petition to deny a liquor license is an improper use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government mechanisms, constituting the initiation of force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  (B) Signing the petition may be a minor initiation of force, but that's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; justified response to the bar's proposed initiation of noise (or the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; negative effects).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  (C) The city government deciding the issue is the nearest available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; approximation to the dispute resolution mechanisms that would exist in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; libertarian society - for example, distributed ownership of &quot;noise rights&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  (D) This is a straightforward conflict of interest between the bar builders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the condo owners, and invoking libertarian ethics is needlessly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complicating the issue.
