<br>
Next the team wants to build a neurocomputer sophisticated enough to learn
<br>
tasks, such as how to move the legs of a robot walking over a boulder-strewn
<br>
landscape or to recognize abstract spatial patterns, including stick-figure
<br>
drawings of people. Either accomplishment will be difficult to pull off.
<br>
&quot;Compared to learning how to walk, calculus is easy,&quot; DeWeerth says. And harder
<br>
problems require more neurons. &quot;We need hundreds of thousands of neurons to
<br>
solve these complicated tasks,&quot; he says. Which presents a major challenge: &quot;How
<br>
do we program them all?&quot;
<br>
In one sense, it should be easy. &quot;Very simple rules can generate complex
<br>
behavior,&quot; Ditto says. Forager ants, for example, create elaborate civilizations
<br>
out of a mere handful of very simple rules. But how do you figure out the
<br>
fundamental set of simple rules?
<br>
It is a question that may never have to be answered. &quot;We don't know how a
<br>
biological system self organizes,&quot; DeWeerth says, &quot;but we might not have to
<br>
understand it to exploit it:' Instead of linking every neuron via computer, the
<br>
team plans to connect a computer to a small number of neurons and allow them to
<br>
communicate with a much larger network of neurons. The computer interface will
<br>
stimulate the neurocomputer in the same way that our eyes, ears, noses, and
<br>
hands provide sensory stimulation to our brains. By sending information and
<br>
feedback through the interface, &quot;we will teach the neurons to make the right
<br>
connections themselves,&quot; DeWeerth says.
<br>
Constant repetition may be the key &quot;The brain adapts continuously, so we keep
<br>
getting better at tasks that we repeat,&quot; DeWeerth says. For example, when a
<br>
novice tennis player lofts a ball above his head and hits it, the brain
<br>
gradually learns to coordinate the muscles needed to serve the ball. But
<br>
teaching neurons takes time. Just imagine how many serves Pete Sampras had to
<br>
hit before he won at Wimbledon.
<br>
Fortunately, neurons love to practice, so Ditto's team is working hard to get
<br>
them started. &quot;We are now gearing up to use two- and three-dimensional pieces of
<br>
neural tissue for computing; he says. Within seven years, he hopes to teach a
<br>
millimeter-sized cube of neurons to da arithmetic and recognize patterns.
<br>
Because it is impossible to insert a computer moderator between all the
<br>
different nerve layers, this will be the first attempt at letting the neurons
<br>
make their own interconnections. Ditto acknowledges that &quot;there are still lots
<br>
of engineering headaches. But once you get the neurons started, you almost can't
<br>
stop them from computing.&quot;
