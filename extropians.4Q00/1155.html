<p><em> &gt; Eugene, describe to me your dream communication medium. No holds

</em><br>
<em> &gt; what people would use for all their communications in a perfect world.
</em><br>
<p>Ok. 
<br>
<p>I want to be able to talk (think words/icons/other legacy overlaid on
<br>
the visual field, beam multimedial imagery including emotions and body
<br>
image (full feelie grade) as cetaceans are supposed to be able to) to
<br>
single persons and groups of people regardless of their
<br>
location. Think of it as electronically augmented tele(em)pathy. If
<br>
they don't listen right now, this stuff is stored.
<br>
<p>I want to be able to receive such communications, store it all in a
<br>
retrievable way (something with a voice/mental interface, preferably
<br>
seamless to the thought process) and apply adaptive neuronal filters
<br>
on it.
<br>
<p>I would like the projection and storage medium to be aware of the
<br>
content structure it is handling. The smarter, the better, so I can
<br>
delegate. I would like it to be ubiquitous, and nonintrusive.
<br>
<p>For time being, I would settle for a parallel ~TFlop wearable with a
<br>
fully immersive see-through headup rendering rich augmented reality,
<br>
voice recognition and synthesis. This functionality would be greatly
<br>
enhanced if I could generate keyboard and (3d)mouse events with a few
<br>
10 bit/s bandwidth implant somewhere in the motorical cortex.  With a
<br>
little training this would make for a truly intuitive GUI: you think
<br>
words on screen, move windows and popup stuff by thinking about it.
<br>
And yeah, it would be very cool if I could talk to the system using
<br>
&quot;inner voice&quot;, and not look and act the average street crazy talking
<br>
to hydrants. Having similiar overlay (cochlear implant, something
<br>
further down audio pipeline) with audio would be nice, too.
<br>
<p>We're probably three-four decades away from such a thing
<br>
hardware-wise.
<br>
<p>Of course, things can get only better with invasive medical
<br>
nanotech. Here you can map your individual concept space to a
<br>
standartized/consensus stream of symbols, propagated
<br>
wirelessly. Borg, sounds Swedish.
