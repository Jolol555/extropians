<em>&gt; &gt; (They believe the Earth is flat, because the Bible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentions &quot;the four corners of the Earth&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I recall something about the &quot;4 winds&quot; but don't recall ever reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anything about 4 corners (at least not in the KJV), and I think something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like that would have stuck with me.  Anybody know whether there is really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such a ref in the good book?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rev. 7:1  And after all these things I saw four angels standing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the four corners of the earth, and holding four winds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the earth...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is of course ambiguous, for it is unclear if the revelator
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saw four angels on *each* corner, each holding four winds?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So it is impossible to tell if there are four winds, or sixteen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or sixty four.  Either way, thats a buncha wind.  Moving on:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isaiah 11:12.  And he shall set up an ensign for the nations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, they get an ensign to collect all the Jewish nerds.  Seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like they could at least pop for a first leutenant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Before we conclude anything, the same book a few chapters over sez:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isaiah 40.22.  It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the inhabitants are as grasshoppers; the stretcheth out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...Which is also the only place in the KJV that the word circle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appears.  So the earth has four corners and is a circle.  Obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they thought the earth was shaped like a cylinder, eh?  spike
</em><br>
<p>Also, since their society evolved out of the the early Babylonian
<br>
culture, we can also look at least that of Hammurabi up to the Kassite
<br>
period in Babylon, when the Kingdom was divided into four quarters,
<br>
which seems to imply that there are four corners to go with those four
<br>
quarters...
