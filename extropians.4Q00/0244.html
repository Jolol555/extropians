<p>I also question, upon the offering of a statistic, what a &quot;warrior&quot; is.
<br>
<p>I think perhaps we can define slightly distinct terms for &quot;soldier&quot; versus and
<br>
vis-a-vis &quot;warrior.&quot;
<br>
<p>Lorrey brings up fighting habit statistics, where some fight, some lie low, and
<br>
others rout.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the reason some will fight is that they follow orders.  That would be my
<br>
separation between soldiers and warriors, where warriors fight for fighting and/or
<br>
their cause, and soldiers fight because they are ordered to fight.  Personally, I
<br>
might not make a good soldier, but perhaps a good warrior or warfighter, except I
<br>
couldn't kill except in the case of imminent self-defense or the defense of
<br>
others.  Thus, I have no cause for which to violently fight, except perhaps in
<br>
terms of words.
<br>
<p>In terms of the immune system analogy, it was perhaps not apt, for as much as it
<br>
was apt.
<br>
<p>I remember science fiction book where essentially there was first contact with a
<br>
cosmopolitan alien society, where the aliens were not very good at fighting, yet
<br>
were at war with a race of Borg-like bugs.  The humans became their premier
<br>
soldiers, or warriors.  There were enough humans that were willing to fight,
<br>
particularly as they did not have the moral objections of killing another human as
<br>
basically the enemy was sans any particular redeeming value.
<br>
<p>So, in terms of the immune system analogy, that can be applied in various ways to
<br>
the species as a whole as well as to any subgroup, whether a state or nation.
<br>
<p>I think we are doing better as a species in terms of avoiding war.  It is generally
<br>
recognized that war is too expensive, and that it ruins things.
<br>
<p>I have some retired soldiers and/or warriors in my family, from the World War II
<br>
and Korean war eras.  I've never tried to drag stories about it out of them, and am
<br>
quite happy that they are alive.  I'm not a war story buff or afficianado, but most
<br>
fictional books I have ever read involved some form of war or other conflict.
<br>
<p>Many romanticize the warriors.  Much of history is about them, having won the wars,
<br>
with the victors adagiantly filling in the blanks.
<br>
<p>I fabricated the word adagiantly, it has to do with that old adage.
<br>
<p>I hope this is not too self-centric, I don't speak for any but myself, heh, and
<br>
those that agree.
