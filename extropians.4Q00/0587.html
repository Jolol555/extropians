Dan asked whether he should pursue a career in philosophy of biomedical 
<br>
engineering. He seemed especially concerned about speeding the development 
<br>
of a cure for ageing.
<br>
<p>I think you could work effectively for the abolishment of ageing along 
<br>
either of these career paths. In biomedical engineering you may be doing 
<br>
hands-on work, but in philosophy you could try to influence society, 
<br>
funding bodies, ethics committees and other groups that affect where the 
<br>
research money goes. Its not obvious where your impact would be greatest. 
<br>
Indeed, you could probably help the cause even by, say, running a Russian 
<br>
prostitution rack - simply getting rich and donating and investing the 
<br>
money in the right ways should work.
<br>
<p>Here is my advice: Think comparative advantage. Ask yourself, what are you 
<br>
most talented in? Go for that. It will give you the best chance of being 
<br>
both happy and effective in your life.
