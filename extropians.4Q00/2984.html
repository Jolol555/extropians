&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 32'nd update on my fly longevity experiments. In Run 
<br>
&nbsp;#31 I retest coconut juice, and synephrine, which improved longevity
<br>
&nbsp;back in Run #28. For comparison purposes, I have reproduced part of 
<br>
&nbsp;Run #28 below as well.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flies used in Run #31 were derived from a rather old breeding
<br>
&nbsp;bottle, which presumably held a lot of older flies. An increased 
<br>
&nbsp;number of doddering flies might account for the higher than normal 
<br>
&nbsp;short-term mortality in both the control bottle, as well as several
<br>
&nbsp;other bottles in this run.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time around synephrine did not increase maximum lifespan, 
<br>
&nbsp;though early survival was enhanced. Judging by its effect on flies,
<br>
&nbsp;synephrine might prove to be a non-toxic antiobesity agent for humans.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again coconut juice was associated with superior overall
<br>
&nbsp;survival, increasing both average and maximum survivals in both runs.
<br>
&nbsp;The active ingrediants in coconut juice are unknown, as is the
<br>
&nbsp;mechanism of their operation.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I included IP6 (inositol hexaphosphate), and resveratrol to test
<br>
&nbsp;thet iron, and copper dependance respectively of fly longevity. Flies 
<br>
&nbsp;fed 4-24 fly food are known to accumulate iron in tissues. Inclusion
<br>
&nbsp;of iron chelators is known to block this accumulation and increase
<br>
&nbsp;longevity slightly. However I use citric acid as a standard additive
<br>
&nbsp;to block pathogen  growth, and this may also reduce iron availability.
<br>
&nbsp;This may be the reason IP6 failed to offer a benefit in the present
<br>
&nbsp;experiment. Resveratrol also proved to be a disappointment.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One surpise hit was with Knudsen elderberry nectar juice. The
<br>
&nbsp;ingrediants are as follows: filtered water, juices from whole apple,
<br>
&nbsp;elderberry, bosenberry, plum, and grape. I was not impressed with the
<br>
&nbsp;results with either apple juice (Run #11), prune juice (Runs #22 &amp; 24) 
<br>
&nbsp;or  with grape juice (Runs #11 &amp; #30), although grape may offer a very
<br>
&nbsp;minor benefit. Both elderberry and bosenberry juices remain to be
<br>
&nbsp;investigated. Although average longevity was the best with elderberry
<br>
&nbsp;nectar, no benefit on maximum lifespan appeared in this run.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Run #32 I retested both coconut, and Knudsen elderberry nectar
<br>
&nbsp;juices. The results were uniformly good. At a 50% dilution both juices
<br>
&nbsp;increased lifespan. At full strength, coconut outperformed 50% juice up
<br>
&nbsp;until the day 37 census. Full strength elderberry improved survival over
<br>
&nbsp;50% nectar at all time points. I will admit to being impressed with
<br>
&nbsp;elderberry nectar. Further experiments investigating this nectar, as
<br>
&nbsp;well as its components are planned for the future.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried another freezer experiment in my ongoing quest to discover
<br>
&nbsp;a method for implimenting hopefully patentible reversible
<br>
&nbsp;cryopreservation, getting rich, famous, etc. Pycnogenol was added to
<br>
&nbsp;all bottles, since this earlier had been found to be beneficial. 
<br>
&nbsp;Various amounts of polyethylene glycol 200 were added to see if this 
<br>
&nbsp;could further increase survival. I chose a low molecular weight PEG,
<br>
&nbsp;so it would be absorbed from the food into fly tissues.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately adding PEG 200 to fly food results in some extra 
<br>
&nbsp;fluid being released from the food when it is thawed out after
<br>
&nbsp;freezing. If there were any surviving flies, they were all drowned.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral of this story is that experiments testing the 
<br>
&nbsp;effectiveness of cryoprotectants in inhibiting freeze/thaw damage
<br>
&nbsp;are not feasible with the current setup.
