<p><em>&gt;Everyone here knows that the biggest problem for long term space
</em><br>
<em>&gt;travel, at least in our current biological state, is that the body
</em><br>
<em>&gt;begins to undergo a type of &quot;space rot&quot; in zero gravity, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;muscles atrophy, the bones weaken, etc. This is most frequently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mentioned as a serious barrier to a manned mission to Mars. On the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ISS, astronauts will get two hours of excercise today. On Mir, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any shuttle mission, physical excercise is always practiced, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the astronauts are still phased when they return to Earth. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;These are missions of less then a year - missions in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weightlessness lasting decades would probably kill us upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;returning to a gravity environment. There needs to be some way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have the muscles in constant excercise, as they are here on Earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resisting gravity. Someone mentioned the idea of tethers, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correctly added that they will clutter up the craft. 
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;Mars Direct&quot; mission as envisioned by the Mars Society's Dr
<br>
Robert Zubrin would use a single tether between the capsule and the
<br>
spent upper stage to achieve the 1/3rd Mars equivalent for the
<br>
duration of the trip, this does not seem to involve clutter.
<br>
<p>Most of the information we have on long duration effects comes from
<br>
the Russians and Mir. Yet when Dr Shannon Lucid flew on Mir-21 she
<br>
suffered no ill effects, she walked off the shuttle, and was
<br>
running all over the next day.
<br>
<p>What we learned was that the cosmonauts on Mir were slacking in the
<br>
performance of the exercise protocol, and we have a least one good
<br>
data point to show low gravity effects can be successfully
<br>
countered. The ISS will no doubt offer additional data points.
