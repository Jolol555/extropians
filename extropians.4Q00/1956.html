<p>Oh, gawd, Joe Michael is still at it.  Understand, he's never built a

thing- he has a rather meaningless patent, a stop-motion animated video

<p>&quot;As a result of a web break in into one of our websites, we are told of
<br>
a vast stream of projects totalling $40m - $60m involving 200 - 300
<br>
researchers and some 30+ papers published without acknowledgement by

rogoue academics. A stern warning is issued to all universities &amp;

companies that engage in theft or participate by working with these

rogue academics of the liabilities they are picking up from licensees.

We have always sought co-operation, and there are no excuses for theft
