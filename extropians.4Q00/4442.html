(Sorry for the mislaunch earlier, this Netscape Messenger is driving
<br>
me up the wall. Due to unfortunate intereference between a MTA
<br>
misconfiguration and the local potsmaster I have to temporarily
<br>
resort to this festering piece of brokenness.)

<p>If your transistors are made from plastic, relativistic latency

will be the least of your problems.
