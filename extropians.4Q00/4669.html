<p><em>&gt; Good points Harvey. I just have to quibble with this one...

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 5.  Free Time:  We also work less time and have a lot of free time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That is a major difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everything I've read says that we work more than ever, that the trend over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time has been for the amount of hours people spend working to increase,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather relentlessly. We may possibly this century be beginning to turn that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around... although with the 35 hour week fading from memory for most of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (yes, it used to exist here), I doubt it.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is is mostly a case of rising expectations: we expect
<br>
more free time, and hence feel that we work all the time. If we
<br>
compare with the dawn to dusk working days that were common before the
<br>
21th century we definitely do not work muc more.
<br>
<p>What may be really changing is that the time constraints of work are
<br>
being dissolved, and this makes it to creep into the free time. I no
<br>
longer have to stop working because it gets too dark, thanks to
<br>
Edison, and today computers makes it possible to work regardless of
<br>
what time it is outside my window - which means there is no strong
<br>
external reason to stop. We seem to be moving towards a
<br>
time-delocalized society.
