<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why won't the Supreme Court allow TV cameras at Friday's hearing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on George W. Bush's appeal of the Florida Supreme Court ruling?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it won't allow cameras at any of their hearings. It allows
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reporters to take notes but not tape proceedings, and members of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the viewing public who try to take notes will have their pencils
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confiscated.
<br>
<p>I realize that we can't expect the tradition-bound U.S. Supreme Court
<br>
to be particularly progressive.  But this restriction on the flow of
<br>
information is highly disturbing.  It's so out of tune with the modern
<br>
view of information as something which is easily copied, processed
<br>
and transmitted.
<br>
<p>What will happen when someone walks into that court with the device
<br>
described today at <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,40337,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,40337,00.html</a>,
<br>
a prosthetic vision system that goes far beyond the correction possible
<br>
with glasses?  This could easily take still or short video pictures
<br>
and no one would be the wiser.
<br>
<p>Futurists have predicted more tightly integrated augmented-vision systems.
<br>
Eventually we will reach the point where everything anyone sees, hears
<br>
or experiences can be replayed for anyone else with full fidelity.
<br>
What will the Supreme Court do then?
<br>
<p>Confiscating pencils to stop people from keeping notes!  How dare they!
<br>
My memories, my experiences, are my own, and whether my memories are
<br>
stored in neural synapses or scribblings on paper is irrelevant.  It's sad
<br>
to see the court clinging to a 19th century model of information when so
<br>
many important 21st century issues, from IP protection to crypto rights,
<br>
will turn on exactly that issue.
