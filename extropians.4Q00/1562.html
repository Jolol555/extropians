<em>&gt;&gt;Alright, let's play a hypothetical game.  Let us suppose that there was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;intelligent life on Mars.  We discovered them when we were first able--many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;years ago.  Everything else is equal.  Today, we look up into the cosmos--
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;nothing.  Just us Earthlings and Martians, staring up into the vastness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;space.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is much better than you cetaceans example, but it still won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quite do, because Mars and Earth are near enough to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crosscontaminated by ejecta. That way if both planets can support
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life, and one planet kindles, the second will be very soon to follow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by infection. But that way you can at least assume that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cerebralisation is deterministic, to a fairly high degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainty (well, the nucleating critters are the same).
</em><br>
<p>The question hinges on how many parts of the Drake equation are shared
<br>
between the two examples of intelligent life.  Mars could be a very good 
<br>
independent data point: development of intelligent life and development
<br>
of technology would be independent; life might or might not be, 
<br>
depending on whether life *had* been transferred from one to the other,
<br>
which we and the Martians could probably figure out.  Survival duration
<br>
for the Martian civ would be a great independent data point.  The only
<br>
thing definitely shared between Mars and Earth is stellar environment,
<br>
and that is a part of the Drake equation we are *finally* getting some
<br>
data on.
<br>
<p>The Fermi paradox is the conflict between our theoretical expectation
<br>
that civilization shouldn't be *that* hard to develop and out knowledge 
<br>
that absolutely every piece of evidence we have ever collected indicates 
<br>
there's  nothing out there.  In science, data trumps theory, *especially* 
<br>
when the theories are as vague and unsupported as our theories of the
<br>
origin of life or the survival duration of technological civilizations.
