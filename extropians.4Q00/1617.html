I hope someone can tell me:
<br>
<p>1) Can alcohol with non-corrosive additives be the fuel for regular,
<br>
unmodified internal combustion engines?
<br>
<p>2) What would be the comparative cost of alcohol versus gasoline at the pump,
<br>
disregarding the cost of pump modification?
<br>
<p>3)  Would an alcohol-fueled combustion engine have any pollutant exhaust?
<br>
<p>4) What other room termperature liquid fuel replacements to gasoline exist?
<br>
