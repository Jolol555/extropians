<p>Just keep up with Doug, and you will be way past me.

<p>They can make orbit with some payload, but not *a lot* of payload.
<br>
We looked at em for carrying a single human for a three orbit joy-ride,
<br>
and found with *extensive* modification they could carry a light person
<br>
and enough air for the five hour ride, assuming very few comforts
<br>
of home, no food, not a lot of safety gear etc.  We didnt end up
<br>
pursuing that business opportunity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Could we
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; launches out of them?
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm, probably not as effective as the low cost commercial liquids
<br>
that are on the drawing boards, but Doug might have an opinion
<br>
here.  Problem with the decomissioned ICBMs are they are really
<br>
designed for creating a ballistic orbit, and you still need a lot more
<br>
delta vee to make even a treetop orbit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Any idea of the number of boosters we're talkin about here?
</em><br>
<p>Jeff, Id tell ya, but then Id hafta give you a frontal lobotomy.  {8^D
<br>
I dont know, actually.  Watch this channel tho, if the NMD program
<br>
goes as I hope it will, there should be a lotta useless missile hardware
<br>
on the market in the next 20 yrs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Are they mostly solid fuel?
</em><br>
<p>All solid fuel.  I assume you are talking about the sub launched
<br>
Fleet Ballistic Missiles here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   What's the shelf life on those things,
</em><br>
<p>Thats a gooooood question Jeff.  They were originally designed
<br>
for 25 years, but 25 years came and went.  A lotta the work
<br>
going on around the bomb factory in the 90s was determining
<br>
what the actual practical life of some of those items really is.
<br>
We have some components qualified to 50 years now, and there
<br>
is every reason to believe that date will come and go too, and it
<br>
will be cheaper at that time to qualify them out to 75 years rather
<br>
than let a bunch of new contracts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; how long do they &quot;keep&quot; before the fuel starts to get &quot;old&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (whatever that means, beyond unsatisfactory reliability re national defense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; megadeath happy meal purposes.  (Eat this you commie swine and smile!))?
</em><br>
<p>{8^D  Jeff you have such a way with words.  Evidently the stuff
<br>
is highly stable.  I havent heard of em being taken out of service
<br>
because the *fuel* was too old.  Of course there are a lotta parts
<br>
on a missile.  Recall that all the age critical stuff that they worry
<br>
about has to do with guidance and control, reliability, accuracy,
<br>
etc.  I dont think the Navy worries too much if they need to pull
<br>
off a booster and throw it away, replace it with a new one, that is
<br>
the *cheap* part.  The notion would be to get the old boosters
<br>
I think.  Still, solids really arent that good for climbing all the way
<br>
to orbit.  They would make good first stages I suppose.
<br>
<p>Also recall we already have a commercial solid-to-orbit vehicle, the
<br>
Athena, formerly called the Lockheed Lauch Vehicle.  It hasnt
<br>
been the most successful.  Its very simple and all, but we havent
<br>
sold very many of them.  For commercial purposes, I still think
<br>
a nice two stage LOX-kerosene burner is the ticket.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can just see it.  Govt. auction.  Offered for sale: surplus to current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operational needs.  Fifty minuteman icbm's.  Recently inspected.  Never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been used.  Buyer must arrange for transport.  No minimum, no reserve. etc etc
</em><br>
<p>Oooops, I guess I coulda read your whole post before starting to
<br>
babble.  Minuteman you say?  Thats a whole nuther story.
<br>
<p>Jeff, Im beginning to see where you are going, and no, I dont think
<br>
there is gonna be huuuge savings in using decommissioned military
<br>
hardware for space access.  Doug might jump in here, but I think
<br>
that the war stuff is too highly specialized for high reliability and other
<br>
design goals to be very good at heavy lift.  The armed forces might
<br>
use some of their own decommissioned missiles for payload lift,
<br>
but I doubt they will sell it at bargain prices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What do they do with these things, anyway, when they decommission them as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of whatever arms control/disarmament agreement requires it?  Anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know FOR SURE?  Destroy them, would be my guess.  But perhaps they're just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no good for &quot;peaceful&quot; purposes.  Doug, spike?  Anyone?
</em><br>
<p>Ja, they destroy them in a very public way.  They serve their purpose
<br>
creating tears of joy in the hearts of peaceloving people everywhere,
<br>
including me.  I cant tell you how pleased I am that these death machines
<br>
were never used, and good chance now they never will be.
<br>
<p>Recall the first manned space boosters were converted military
<br>
hardware.
<br>
<p>A few of the motors are used for ground test purposes, and of
<br>
course they have flight tests often.  The FBM system has had
<br>
89 consecutive flawless firings, last I heard, and some of this
<br>
hardware is getting up there in years now.  Shows to go ya, the
<br>
stuff was designed right to start with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I won't embellish my question any further because you can see where I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going.  I mean it isn't exactly rocket sci...well, er,... I guess,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually, it is.
</em><br>
<p>Jeff keep an eye out for that guy from Kennewick Washington.
<br>
He is using Commie boosters with a recoverable first stage, from
<br>
the sea.  Sounds to me like the front runner for doing what
<br>
you describe: low cost access to space.  Kistler Engineering I
<br>
think its called, and Doug, this would be a great place to plug
<br>
your company.  spike
