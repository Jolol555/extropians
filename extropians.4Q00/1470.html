<p>
I've been away for two days, and will have infrequent access to the Net for 
<br>
the next few days, so I can only address this very briefly tonight, in 
<br>
between trips.
<br>
<p>First, while I can't say I liked the way Ian Arcatling expressed his 
<br>
frustration, I can understand it if some people feel like ExI hasn't been 
<br>
sufficiently responsive recently. It has been in a transition. I once was 
<br>
employed by ExI and do a lot more work for it. That has not been true for 
<br>
quite some time. My own recent learning experience about business has 
<br>
helped me to start changing the way the Institute functions, given our 
<br>
extremely limited funds.
<br>
<p>We are in the process of revamping our administration. Those of you who 
<br>
recently received the members' email update (the first in a while) will 
<br>
have heard about some of the projects we have in the works. Not only is E. 
<br>
Shaun doing a tremendous job of taking over membership administration 
<br>
(that's partly why you're now receiving updates), but I recently brought 
<br>
together a group of extropian activists and we're involved in 
<br>
organizational discussions. We are defining quite a few projects and 
<br>
organizing to make them happen. Members and non-members will receive more 
<br>
frequent emailings from us. Volunteers look set to upgrade the web site. 
<br>
Our supportive friends are working on creating a members' database and 
<br>
several other projects that you will be hearing about in the emailings. 
<br>
We're also planning a major gathering, but it will take a few months.
<br>
<p>As was pointed out (by E. Shaun or Greg), ExI members who attended the 
<br>
EXTRO 4 conference did receive a clear benefit for their membership dues. 
<br>
Everyone else contributed and made it possible to continue functioning and 
<br>
to keep spreading these ideas.
<br>
<p>MEMBERSHIP EXTENSION OFFER
<br>
If you did *not* attend the EXTRO 4 conference and feel that you did not 
<br>
receive sufficient value for your membership--if you are not satisfied with 
<br>
your contribution simply keeping the Institute functioning (providing this 
<br>
list and the many other email lists, the web site, responding to a 
<br>
continual stream of media, and acting as a magnet for transhumanists), then 
<br>
ask our new Operations Officer, E. Shaun Russell for a one-year extension 
<br>
of your membership. I have asked Ian to grant any such requests.
<br>
<p>I believe we are moving into a tremendously exciting time. Many people are 
<br>
joining in with me to move Extropy Institute into a new era of 
<br>
activity--one that does not depend so much on me, on any one person or tiny 
<br>
group of persons.
<br>
<p>If you think you are a member but did not receive the recent members' 
<br>
mailing, please make sure E. Shaun has your current email address. We did 
<br>
send the update out to members whose membership had expired several months 
<br>
ago. We have also recently made additions and changes to the web sit 
<br>
recently and, of course, there is Extrodot.org.
<br>
<p>I will do my best to respond to individual messages promptly, but I will be 
<br>
travelling for the most of the next week.
<br>
<p>Onward!
<br>
