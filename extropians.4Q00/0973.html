&nbsp;Yup. People need beliefs, reference points. Welcome to existentialism. Now
<br>
&nbsp;obsoleted by Existentialism Plus, of course. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I am not sure as you are that existentialism covers it as well for everyone 
<br>
else as it satisfies your psychological needs.  Once virtual immortalism is 
<br>
achieved somehow, the you will get a test of existentialism. I was reading a 
<br>
book about the 100 most important, as seen from the year 3000. THe book is A 
<br>
View From The Year 3000, by astronomer, Michael Hart. In his fiction of the 
<br>
future the author states that immortalism was achived in the late 22nd 
<br>
century, and one of the results was that the books of this time became 
<br>
un-readable because our whole existence is clouded by mortality-hence so is 
<br>
our literature. 
<br>
<p>The author, had a tiny minority among those who retained a religious 
<br>
identity, regardless of near immortalism being a fact of everyday life. The 
<br>
most important person to receive top of the Hundred, was a scientist who 
<br>
developed &quot;pseudo-immortality&quot;. So we shan't see a true test of Monotheism's 
<br>
durability until we achieve some form of consciouness-involved immortalism.
