<em>&gt; &quot;If anyone can show me, and prove to me, that I am wrong in thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or deed, I will gladly change.  I seek the truth, which never yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hurt anybody.  It is only persistence in self-delusion and ignorance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which does harm.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;               -- Marcus Aurelius, MEDITATIONS, VI, 21
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The argument here against this functional position is that someone is
<br>
achieving immortality, someone who will undoubtedly be very happy with the
<br>
results, and good luck to them. Unfortunately, it will not be &quot;you&quot;, the
<br>
original. The original person never makes it into the machine. If they are
<br>
unharmed by the process, they find that they continue living just as they
<br>
had done (relatively dissapointed, one would imagine). If they are
<br>
destroyed, well, they die, just the fate they were trying to avoid.
<br>
<p>I certainly don't argue that the copy feels as though it is the original,
<br>
moved into the machine; for the copy, this is a very successful process. But
<br>
there is someone else, the original, who has a very different experience.
