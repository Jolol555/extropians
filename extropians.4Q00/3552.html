<em>&gt; Sorry, Mike, but this claim is so outrageous that I can't believe you
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; shows a recent hate crime in Vermont that did not involve gays.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.mountainpridemedia.org/jan99/hatecrime.htm">http://www.mountainpridemedia.org/jan99/hatecrime.htm</a>&gt; states that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there were 48 hate crimes reported in Vermont last year.  Half of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these were against blacks (and not gays).
</em><br>
<p>No, it says no such thing. It is a story about a 17 year old student
<br>
assaulted a 15 year old student, with no statements about any expressed
<br>
'hate crime' by the perp, but ,&quot;The juvenile victim was being called a
<br>
number of names, derogatory names for homosexual, and that would prompt
<br>
us to look further to see if it is in fact hate motivated..&quot;
<br>
<p>How many of us (especially us geeks) have been called fags, queers, or
<br>
other derogatory names for homosexual, in high school? I was. So what?
<br>
Its a common thing to call someone at that age, regardless of actual
<br>
sexual persuasion.
<br>
<p>Now, you expand upon my statement (which was talking about gay related
<br>
hate crimes in vermont since the beginning of the &quot;Take Back Vermont&quot;
<br>
campaign, so try to stay in context) in a vast generalization (now look
<br>
who it is that is generalizing, not me.) 
<br>
<p>I can tell you about a 'hate crime' that occured earlier in the year
<br>
here in White River Junction:
<br>
<p>A black cop arrested a significantly drunken white woman, who resisted
<br>
arrest and called the officer racially derogatory names. The officer
<br>
charged her with a hate crime violation in addition to her alcohol
<br>
related charges. I am sorry, but this is what is complete bullshit, and
<br>
are what I said fall under the category of 'insignificant'. 
<br>
<p>The way the hate crimes law is written here in Vermont it is essentially
<br>
a thought crime law. Expression of any non-politically-correct statement
<br>
in Vermont in earshot of a reporter or someone who may potentially take
<br>
offense at your speech could get you charged with a hate crime. It is
<br>
the most restrictive such hate crime law in the nation. Yet you then
<br>
admit that there were a grand total of 48 of these sort of 'hate crimes'
<br>
in Vermont in a whole year. Wellll SHEEEEAAATT. I'll be you could rack
<br>
up that many offenses in less than a minute in a single square mile of
<br>
any city in the US, if they used the same standards, so you are
<br>
essentially proving my original point. Thanks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are plenty of other news reports of other hate crimes available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on-line.  I can't imagine that anyone could believe that all hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crimes in Vermont have suddenly ceased, only to be replaced by gay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frauds.  It just sounds so unbelievable.
</em><br>
<p>I did not say they did. It is you who are generalizing, again.
