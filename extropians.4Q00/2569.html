<p>It doesn't provide sufficient information to verify any precise claim. I 
<br>
assume they are talking about fairly moderate aerobic exercise, in which 
<br>
case 30-45 minutes may be needed to gain full benefit. That doesn't 
<br>
conflict with my claim that 20-25 minutes of more intense aerobic exercise 
<br>
produces the same benefits. It's also more time efficient and results in 
<br>
higher performance capacity.
<br>
<p>One thing that I don't think has been mentioned but which matters: If 
<br>
you're doing any form of regular exercise, you'll reduce the free radical 
<br>
by-products and reduce oxidative stress if you're taking daily supplements 
<br>
of anti-oxidants. The basics are good -- C, E, Selenium, and so on. I'm now 
<br>
taking twice a day doses of a personalized formula prepared by the Kronos 
<br>
Clinic. The tests there determined where oxidative damage was coming from 
<br>
and how to reduce it.
<br>
<p>March on!
