<p>I don't know if you are up on the uranium salt water fission rocket that
<br>
Zubrin came up with in the early 90's. It uses water doped with 90%
<br>
weapons grade uranium salts for fuel, stored in Beryllium tubes, and
<br>
released into the combustion chamber fast enough so that the
<br>
supercritical stage of the fission chain reaction occurs just outside
<br>
the mixing chamber. Minimum 3 million pounds thrust at 10,000 sec
<br>
impulse.
<br>
<p>Now, imagine we've got some sort of collection scoop in front of the
<br>
engine and behind the mutha hunka ice you're using as a shield, such
<br>
that the evaporating gasses are further heated by the exhaust plume of
<br>
the rocket.
<br>
<p>Zubrin was claiming that his rocket could attain 3.9% of light speed on
<br>
a mission to Alpha Centauri for a 150 year mission.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Heres how I figure: an astronaut is usually at least 30 and human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life expectancy is about 75, so 45 years to cover... lets see, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nearest star is about 4 light years and some change I think, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about 0.1c to get there in a lifetime, neglecting acceleration and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deceleration phases.
</em><br>
<p>Alpha C is 4.4, Proxima C is 4.2 ly. The Alpha C binary of two sunlike
<br>
stars are allegedly far apart enough to allow terrestrial planets to
<br>
orbit both stars. Beta orbits out around the distance of Saturn from
<br>
Alpha. Eps Eridani has a recognisable gap in its dust disk, and Marcy et
<br>
al have evidence of jovians orbiting. Eps E is around 10 ly away.
<br>
<p>I assume you are stating an average velocity of .1c. I think the
<br>
saltwater fission rocket could do that easy.
