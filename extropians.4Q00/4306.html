<p>I think this is a crucial point, although there are committees whose

<p><p>Rather than to jump to one Senator for every two states, which would 
<br>
exacerbate the problem of centralization of  power (which has local effects 
<br>
similar to absentee land ownership), I'd suggest going back to something 
<br>
more like the original USA setup where each state was sovereign and the 
<br>
federal government had extremely limited powers. I'd go even farther and 
<br>
suggest doing away with all permanent federal offices. Instead, have 
<br>
citizens of each state elect representatives only for specific purposes, 
<br>
possibly including regularly scheduled annual meetings.  Serving as a state 
<br>
representative might then be seen as a public service, not as a way to gain 
<br>
power and wealth and not as a permanent career.
