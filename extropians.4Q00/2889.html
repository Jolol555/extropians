<em>&gt; I was under the impression that the rotors being used have very broad

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Insects have two differences, first they are in air, and secondly they
<br>
are thousands to a million times bigger than what we are talking about.
<br>
<p>In 9.4.2.1 of Nanomedicine, Freitas compares a human swimming underwater
<br>
with a bacterium.  There are two forces, inertia and viscous drag.
<br>
For a human swimmer inertial force is 10 Newtons and viscous force is
<br>
.0001 Newtons, a ratio of 10^5.  However for a bacterium the situation
<br>
is reversed.  Viscous forces are 10^5 greater than inertial forces.
<br>
<p>&quot;The bacterium (or any micron-sized medical robot) lives in a world
<br>
dominated by viscosity, where, as an example, the phenomenon of 'coasting'
<br>
essentially ceases to exist.  For enstance if motive power to a swimming
<br>
nanorobot with radius R = 1 micron and velocity v = 1 cm/sec is suddenly
<br>
stopped, then the nanorobot will 'coast' to a halt in time 0.1 microsec
<br>
and in a distance 1 nm.&quot;
<br>
<p>He goes on, &quot;Purcell notes that for a man to be swimming at the same
<br>
Reynolds number as his own sperm, he would have to be placed in a swimming
<br>
pool full of molasses and then be forbidden to move any part of his body
<br>
faster than 1 cm/min, roughly the speed of the minute-hand of a large
<br>
wall clock.&quot;
<br>
<p>In this environment a better model than a propeller is a threaded screw,
<br>
which by rotating forces its way forward through the viscous medium.
<br>
This is essentially what the bacterial flagellum does.
<br>
<p>Freitas discusses flying nanobots in section 9.5.3.1:
<br>
<p>&quot;Insects make use of both inertial and viscous forces, often employing
<br>
unusual wing flapping patterns and elastic energy storage systems to
<br>
remain aloft.  The smallest known flying insect that can make any use
<br>
of aerodynamic lift (inertial) forces is the four-winged parasitic
<br>
chalcid wasp Encarsia formosa, which has a total wingspan of ~1.4 mm.
<br>
Aerobotic machines with wingspans smaller than 100 microns probably must
<br>
make almost exclusive use of viscous propulsive forces.&quot;
<br>
<p>He concludes that flying nanobots would do better to propel themselves
<br>
using similar mechanisms to those used by bacteria in water, such as
<br>
corkscrew flagellar drives, rather than wings and jets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In my terraforming paper I wrote, I came up with the concept of a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buckeyball (C-360  or larger) molecule with no matter inside should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bouyant in a 1 bar atmosphere, as a nano-balloon (my CO2 sequestering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanites would have these on their bodies to float in the atmosphere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above the point where the atmosphere was too hot for the carbon to not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burn up).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From a post on sci.nanotech by Robert Shimmin, nothing near C-360 will work.
</em><br>
Try C-100000000:
<br>
: For a purely back-of-envelope job:
<br>
: C-60 has a diameter of 1.2 nm.  Assuming the C-C bond length remains constantish,
<br>
: a single buckyball ought to have a bulk density of about density [kg/m3] = 10200 /
<br>
: sqrt(# C atoms).
<br>
:  
<br>
: This gives C60 a density of 1320 kg/m3, abou 60% that of graphite.  To float in air
<br>
: (density ~1 kg/m3), you'd need a buckyball with at least 10^8 carbons in it.  It would
<br>
: have a diameter of about 1.5 microns.  No clue whether a fullerene this flat could
<br>
: withstand atmospheric pressure. 
<br>
<p>Freitas has something to say about this in 9.5.3.3:
<br>
<p>&quot;What is the tiniest possible lighter-than-air balloon?  J.S. Hall
<br>
notes that for a one-atom-thick graphene shell the out-of-plane bending
<br>
stiffness of the C-C bond is much lower than the in-plane stretching
<br>
stiffness.  This is why hollow fullerenes of submicron diameter are
<br>
experimentally observed to collapse (and remain collapsed due to van
<br>
der Waals forces) even when their interiors are not evacuated.&quot;
<br>
<p>Freitas goes on to analyze the weight of internal cross beams
<br>
sufficient to prevent collapse, and finds that they weigh too much.
<br>
No balloon of this design can float in air &quot;although macroscale
<br>
geodesic trusswork-stabilized vacuum balloons cannot be ruled out&quot;.
<br>
His best approach is to fill the balloon with hydrogen or helium.
<br>
A helium filled 13.6 micron fullerene sphere can lift a payload of 1
<br>
cubic micron of water.  Generally speaking, powered propulsion will be
<br>
superior, as gravitational forces are relatively small at the nanoscale.
<br>
<p>BTW the complete text of the book is available online at
<br>
www.nanomedicine.com.  This is an astonishingly complete resource for those
<br>
interested in the capabilities of nanomachines.  The book is about far more
<br>
than medical applications.
