<br>
<p>All the things you mention are currently projects in progress for Extropy
<br>
Institute.  We are admittedly in the process of reorganizing the way we do
<br>
things on both an operational and organizational level.  Anyone who is
<br>
currently an ExI member, or has been in the past two years, has received a
<br>
lengthy members' letter informing him/her of these updates to Extropy
<br>
Institute.  (If you fit the above criteria and haven't yet received a
<br>
letter, it is likely because we don't have a current e-mail address for
<br>
you...please send it to me in a private e-mail).
<br>
<p>It is unfortunate that Ian Arcantling and others have felt neglected in the
<br>
past, and we are working to make sure that it does not happen in the
<br>
future.  When you look at the success of the Institute in the recent past,
<br>
(including a lengthy article on Extropy in Wired, Natasha's consistent
<br>
coverage in other high-profile magazines, the addition of Ray Kurzweil to
<br>
the Advisory Council, and other such accolades) not to mention the success
<br>
of Extro-4, it should be apparent that such progresses will not stop.
<br>
<p>Again, I assure you that Extropy Institute is in the process of creating a
<br>
large amount of exciting new projects...just wait and see.
