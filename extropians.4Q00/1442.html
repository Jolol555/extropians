</em><br>
<p>Depends. Do you get something of benefit, no matter how intangible, for the mere
<br>
existence of ExI in the world? I would say that this benefit over the last ten
<br>
years has been significant. I certainly don't belong to the NRA just because of
<br>
the magazine, and I did not belong to the local gun club (and serve on its BOD)
<br>
because I was benefitted (on the contrary, I gave far more of my time to it than
<br>
I received in use of facilities, and had to deal with far more political
<br>
bullshit). Now, if you are the sort of shallow person who only thinks in terms
<br>
of immediate material benefit, I suppose ExI may not be for you, either in terms
<br>
of its membership benefits or in its overall long term goals.
