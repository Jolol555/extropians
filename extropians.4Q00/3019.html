You may not have to wait for genetic engineering and to be (re)born a
<br>
woman in order to benefit from extra-channel color perception.  I wrote a
<br>
few months ago about a patent by cypherpunk Raph Levien which accomplishes
<br>
much the same thing using special glasses.  Here is the description,
<br>
from <a href="http://www.delphion.com/details?&pn=US05218386">http://www.delphion.com/details?&pn=US05218386</a>__:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present invention is directed towards a method
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and apparatus for permitting human perception of more of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spectrophotometric values which define the color of an observed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;object. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a first optical filter is provided having a spectral response
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;curve that selectively admits portions of three bands of light,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corresponding to red, green, and blue. The optical filter would be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worn over one eye (say, the left eye). The right eye would observe
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color through a similar optical filter, but with different portions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the three bands admitted.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two eyes perceive two different shifts in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the color of an object relative to the perception of the color of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;object by the unaided eye. These shifts are dependent on properties
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the spectrophotometric color of the object which are not visible
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the unaided eye. Therefore, the eye is capable of an expanded
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perception of color compared to the unaided eye, because each eye
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sees different colors of the same scene.  This expanded perception
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is analogous to the added dimension of depth perception because each
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eye sees perspectives of the same scene.
<br>
<p>It would take some time to get used to your two eyes seeing different
<br>
colors, but perhaps it would eventually become unconscious.  There were
<br>
famous experiments back in the 60s in which people wore special glasses
<br>
that turned the visual image upside down!  After a few days they got used
<br>
to it and everything looked normal.  Then when they took the glasses off
<br>
they had to adjust again.  If people can adapt to such a radical change
<br>
as this, then incorporating some extra color information ought to be easy.
