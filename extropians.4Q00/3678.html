<br>
<p><em>&gt; Subjectivism isn't nonsense- the entire discipline of hermeneutics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  depends
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  on this concept.  
</em><br>
<p>I'll confess I'm no expert on the technical philosophical writing that passes 
<br>
under the name of &quot;hermeneutics.&quot;  And I'll also acknowledge that modern 
<br>
scholarship which stresses the context of historical narratives has at least 
<br>
that as an important contribution to our culture.  But the complete 
<br>
relativism that has come to dominate contemporary academia could only seem 
<br>
anything but absurd to someone immersed in it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although I agree that post-modernism is a dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  paradigm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that hasn't had it's funeral yet, I can't agree with a paradigm which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  denies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the relevance of my existence.  
</em><br>
<p>I don't follow how pursuit of a rational approach to life &quot;denies the 
<br>
relevance of your existence&quot;.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but somehow you seem 
<br>
to be equating reason with emotional sterility.  This is the straw man that 
<br>
the early firebrands of the Romantic movement attacked.  But it is just that: 
<br>
A shallow caricature of reason.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Not that the ideological progressives of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  1950's were any better (Karl Marx?  Communist Materialism?!?)... I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that Romanticism is lousy as a base from which to work, or a social
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  paradigm, but it's a wonderful way to live one's life.  In my opinion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  best philosophy isn't that which achieves the most universal happiness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the one that tells the best story in the end.  Wars, revolutions, love,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  hate, death- this is what makes life interesting!
</em><br>
<p>The glorious triumph of the Volk; the stirring triumph of the proletarian 
<br>
dictatorship!  What great stories!  How interesting!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt;  Well then, zeig heil!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; I wonder what this could mean.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Extrobots seldom seem to grasp the concept of &quot;meaning&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I don't normally engage in ad hominem interchanges, but I feel compelled to 
<br>
make some response here.  Damien Broderick is one of the most learned men 
<br>
I've encountered in my life, and is also a great wit and a true gentleman.  
<br>
He's written deeply about postmodernism from a not entirely unsympathetic and 
<br>
certainly not uninformed position.  I have one of his books on the subject in 
<br>
my list of upcoming reading materials.  I've been studying philosophy for 
<br>
longer than you've been alive, Nicq, and I work with the practical problems 
<br>
of applied ethics, psychology and history every day in my profession.  This 
<br>
list is graced with a brilliant constellation of some of the finest minds of 
<br>
our generation.  May I suggest that the thrill of hurling an epithet like 
<br>
&quot;extrobot&quot; might not be worth the brief pleasure it may give you: By losing 
<br>
the respect of people who have much to teach, you may miss some little lesson 
<br>
or other that could stand you in good stead some day.
