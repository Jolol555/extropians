<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20Clarification%20and%20limited%20apology&In-Reply-To=&lt;6a.988c3ab.276cc487@aol.com&gt;">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a> writes:&lt;&lt; Gore specifically called this &quot;the 
<br>
Information Superhighway&quot; to parallel a similar bill his father had passed 
<br>
which created the Interstate Superhighway system.  As much as his father 
<br>
created the Interstate Highway system, Al Gore created the public Internet 
<br>
system in America. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Harvey,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you discuss creating the Interstate Superhighway System did you ever 
<br>
hear of a fellow named Dwight Eisenhower?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the two Gores worked on the implementation or improvement of the 
<br>
interstate highway system or the internet then please give them due credit 
<br>
for doing so but when you overdo it you create a bad impression.  Or perhaps 
<br>
it would be just as correct to say they did that?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we hear you say what you said we assume, naturally, that they were 
<br>
the prime movers - they weren't.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is plenty of credit to go around and to also be proud of without 
<br>
overdoing it.
<br>
Ron h.
