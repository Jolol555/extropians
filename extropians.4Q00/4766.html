<p>She was in other movies and some were good and some were not so good.  I just

think she's a good actress or actor if that is the term.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Symbolic of *what*? At the end, this goose does the equivalent of Homer

</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the fun?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It seemed in the context of the movie that he (Vincent?) was otherwise qualified
<br>
for the task.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The explanation offered in the swimming scene was that the unmodified bro
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was able to match and even beat the phenotypically enhanced bro *because he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; held nothing in reserve*. That is, he could swim farther out to sea in one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction because his brother rather wimpishly planned to get back alive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This stupid plan turned out to work because his superior brother
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *unaccountably in terms of the agreed conditions* ran out of puff on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extended outward journey (even though he still had nearly enough reserves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get back to shore), and godhelpus was then towed in, coughing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gasping and drowning, by the feeble brother, who presumably Used the Force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Give me a break. A symbol has to be commensurate with the claim it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allegorizing. GATTACA just denied without a blush the very claims it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; established.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We can't say exactly why he won.  Maybe he won because the brother did not
<br>
believe he could, disbelief was expressed, as it defied his logic.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now this is a worthy tactic if all such claims really are bogus. Fritz
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Leiber published a very famous short story in the 1950s, `Poor Superman',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which took the piss nicely out of L. Ron Hubbard's absurd claims; Leiber's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sarcastic equivalent of a `clear' is palpably self-deceiving, like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dupes who feed the Scientology coffers. But real gene engineering of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GATTACA kind *won't* be bogus, even if Uma Thurman and Jeremy Rifkin tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us otherwise. Its drastic improvements *won't* be amenable to being bested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by grit on the past of the old fashioned unmodified, any more than a guy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a megaphone and all the determination in the world can better be heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at cross-continental distances than one with a radio transmitter.

<p>Genetic engineering might be able to maximize our potential as human beings.
<br>
Consider an ant, it can lift thirty times its weight, no human can do that, and
<br>
probably no genetically modified human could.
<br>
<p>So, the genes that provide a body for a sport phenotype might allow a person with
<br>
the most scientifically tuned and efficient body for windsurfing, for example.
<br>
Will the person make a good windsurfer?  Take twenty random people and train them
<br>
for five years to be windsurfers.  Will any be?
<br>
<p>There is certainly nature versus nurture in effect here, in the context of
<br>
genetic modification as a panacea to humanities' woes.  Create twenty clones of
<br>
Shakespeare, would that prove conclusively that Shakespeare wrote all of his
<br>
works?  It helps if they're taught to read.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;So, if you claim that genetic engineering of people will make people hardier and
<br>
better in all ways than all the previous thousands of generations, then I would
<br>
disagree.  It might make them very good, but then they would just be the previous
<br>
generation.
