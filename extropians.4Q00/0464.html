<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; As nifty as these ideas are for a novel, assuming we could, why

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; The easiest reason in the world: because the bad guys would already be doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; it...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This already assumes that there is some kind of economic or other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value attached to creating moreaus. Swann's scenario where most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moreaus seem to have been created as cheap supersoldiers doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem very plausible to me.
</em><br>
<p>Nor to me in the context of CURRENT society. We currently share the western
<br>
ideal that a soldier defending a society should be a vested member of that
<br>
society, a citizen-soldier. We dislike mercenaries. However, this is changing,
<br>
as we've seen in the Katanga conflicts in the 60's and the recent successes of
<br>
mercs (until the UN got involved) in Sierra Leone against geurrillas, and where
<br>
more and more assets are being vested in fewer and fewer high tech weapons
<br>
platforms, the only weapon this trend of concentration of assets and force has
<br>
not followed closely in is the infantry soldier. When these other advanced
<br>
weapons make life impossible for an infantryman, there will be pressure to apply
<br>
similar R&amp;D to the infantry soldier. The small hand held anti-aircraft missile
<br>
is an early precursor of this potential trend. I think that Swann also assumes
<br>
that as fewer and fewer members of society actually serve in the military, and
<br>
enjoy high tech lifestyles and value their lives more, that it will become
<br>
necessary for some sort of recruitment of military members from outside society.
<br>
Using immigrants is one possibility, but difficult in an age when espionage is
<br>
such a large part of military work. Using homegrown personnel, who's only home
<br>
where they are accepted is the military, and who are large and strong enough to
<br>
carry all the advanced high tech weaponry tend to lend itself to the genetic
<br>
augmentation of animal species.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; I just read _Forests of the Night_, which I am guessing is the second of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Moreau novels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, it's the first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; #1 _Forests of the Night_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; #2 _Emperors of the Twilight_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; #3 _Specters of the Dawn_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's also the rather recent _Fearful Symmetries_, subtitled &quot;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Return of Nohar Rajasthan&quot;, which I haven't read yet, but I guess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the subtitle says it all (i.e. it's a sequel to _Forests of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Night_).
</em><br>
<p>THanks, I will look for these.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; I've already read Swann's _Hostile Takeover_ trilogy, which occurs in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; same universe, a hundred or two years later.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's really a single large novel, broken up into three volumes for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; publishing reasons.  I don't want to recommend the Moreau novels in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an Extropian context, but _Hostile Takeover_, comprising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; #1 _Privateer_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; #2 _Partisan_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; #3 _Revolutionary_,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is of some Extropian interest:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - The setting is the anarchist planet of Bakunin, covered by a multitude
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    of very different communes that only agree on one thing:  They don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    want a government.  Internally, the communes follow all kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    lifestyles and social organizations, and then some, but their external
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    relations are as libertarian as you can get.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is rather interesting to read, a very good effort by Swann, though he
<br>
does portray Bakunin to be far more violent than I would expect such a world to
<br>
be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Nanotechnology has been banned after some unfortunate incidents
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    in the solar system (on the jovians?  I forgot).  Those are never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    detailed, but the implication is some gray goo type catastrophes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    However, on Bakunin, which is outside the bounds of law and any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    kind of government rule, there is a lone nanotechnology commune,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    well-isolated and under explicit threat of being immediately
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    nuked by the other communes should there be any incidents.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    protagonist eventually visits the commune, which turns out to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    (in the terms of this mailing list) post-singularity.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, its existence is known to few even on Bakunin. Dominic Magnus knows
<br>
about it because of some deals he had done with them years before.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - AI has also been banned, though I have forgotten whether for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    any inherent reasons or because it was a staple of The Race, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    first alien species to mess with greater humanity.  For alien
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    moral reasons, The Race tried to subvert human civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    without direct action--Terra returned the favor by sending some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    warships, and that was it for The Race.  A surviving Race AI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    one of the protagonists.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, The Race is the source of the evil 'franks' found in _Forests of the
<br>
Night_, who are found to be manipulating the US political system (via campaign
<br>
contributions in the billions from black market synthetic diamond sales) to kill
<br>
off space exploration, high tech research, and foment racial and inter-species
<br>
civil unrest. When Nohar Rajasthan helped catch the five Race infiltrators,
<br>
their AI's were seized by the US and used to engineer propaganda/meme campaigns
<br>
against genetic engineering, AI, and nanotechnology, which forced non-human
<br>
constructs to flee Terra to found the Seven Worlds Alliance.
<br>
The protagonist AI in the Hostile Takeover series is actually an amalgam of
<br>
several Race AI computers, who actually founded Bakunin both to hide in and
<br>
establish a political and economic black hole they use to bring down the Terran
<br>
Economic Council (TEC) which is sort of a fascist UN interstellar government.
