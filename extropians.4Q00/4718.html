<p>What a very cool vision! It's kind of plausible, too, if you buy into the
<br>
nano-santa stuff. After all, this talk about levels of tech and work
<br>
required to support person on a certain area of land is really about how
<br>
much tech &amp; work you need to put it, to cope with a given level of
<br>
resources. The tech and work help you make more of less. Given a super duper
<br>
general assembler kit (probably built into your body), you don't really need
<br>
many raw resources to do very well indeed! It's questionable how much work
<br>
you'd need to do; not heaps, I'd think. That fits with the hunter-gatherer
<br>
idea. Original-affluence++, excellent.
<br>
<p>We could see &quot;people&quot; (in the broadest sense) spread out amongst the stars
<br>
in what looks very much like nomadic hunter-gatherers spreading across new
<br>
continents. Hardly the galactic empires of the space operas.
