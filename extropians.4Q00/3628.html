<em>&gt; I have a piece in the weekend issue of an Australian newspaper, The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brisbane CourierMail, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.couriermail.com.au/">http://www.couriermail.com.au/</a>
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Find the Books section, then, under the story headed `Faith in fakes',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; click on the word &lt; report &gt;.

<p>&quot;Still, if you were trapped inside a temple next to a ticking bomb, who
<br>
would you rather have trying to defuse it: a well-trained rational bomb
<br>
disposal expert or the local holy man with a direct line to divine
<br>
intervention?&quot;
<br>
<p>I'll take option three: Why not have a well-trained rational bomb disposal
<br>
expert who is also a holy man with a direct line to divine intervention?  Of
<br>
course, I wouldn't be in the temple to begin with- I probably planted the
<br>
bomb.
<br>
<p>&quot;Rene Descartes blew it back in the 17th century by supposing that humans
<br>
are cobbled together from a mechanical &quot;android&quot; body and a mysteriously
<br>
invisible, untouchable soul, an immaterial essence designed to survive the
<br>
corruption of the flesh.&quot;
<br>
<p>Descartes didn't 'blow it', but he certainly didn't have the whole story.
<br>
Theologians and Neuroscientists are both blind, if you ask me.
<br>
<p>&quot;A rebound was inevitable, when Romanticism played up &quot;authentic&quot; blinding
<br>
passion at the expense of reasoning. Now we know better.&quot;
<br>
<p>We do?  At least the Romantics knew how to live and write great poetry.
<br>
Rationally, they also bucked the trends of their time- many of them were
<br>
atheists.  I'd rather be in their camp than that of the &quot;rationalists&quot; of
<br>
any era.
<br>
<p>&quot;This discovery gets us some of the way out of the faith versus reason mess,
<br>
but we might still wonder why people believe such crazy things so readily.
<br>
Of course, we flatter ourselves that &quot;our&quot; deepest beliefs are
<br>
unquestionably true and make perfect sense.&quot;
<br>
<p>At least you're honest, Damien.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just shuffling those memes into visibility like a trouper...
</em><br>
<p>Well then, zeig heil!
<br>

<p>&quot;We do progress, but how?  Not by the tinkering of the meliorist; not by the
<br>
crushing of initiative; not by laws and regulations which hamstring the
<br>
racehorse, and handcuff the boxer; but by the innovations of the eccentric,
<br>
by the phantasies of the hashish-dreamer of philosophy, by the aspirations
<br>
of the idealist to the impossible, by the imagination of the revolutionary,
<br>
by the perilous adventure of the pioneer.  Progress is by leaps and bounds,
<br>
by breaking from custom, by working on untried experiments; in short, by the
<br>
follies and crimes of men of genius, only recognizable as wisdom and virtue
<br>
after they have been tortured to death, and their murderers reap gloatingly
<br>
the harvest of the seeds they sowed at midnight.&quot; -Aleister Crowley, &quot;On
<br>
Original Sin&quot;
