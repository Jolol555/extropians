<p>Cantilever Tales
<br>
<p>Alexander Hellemans*
<br>
<p>Building even the simplest nanomachines is a daunting challenge, but
<br>
working models serve as springboards to grander designs. A classic
<br>
example is the cantilever, an indispensable cog in the nanoworld that
<br>
ushered in the scanning probe microscopy revolution. Today
<br>
cantilevers, which resemble tiny diving boards, are the operating
<br>
principle behind a host of experimental devices that could debut in
<br>
the next decade.
<br>
<p>Nanosized cantilevers earned their claim to fame in the mid-1980s with
<br>
the invention of atomic force microscopes (AFMs). To chart the
<br>
surfaces of molecules, AFMs run the tip of a cantilever across an
<br>
object under investigation; intermolecular forces between probe and
<br>
object tug the cantilever tip up and down over the surface, like the
<br>
stylus of a record player. A reflected laser beam records this motion,
<br>
and the signal can be converted into an image of the surface.
<br>
<p>Cantilevers are proving to be more versatile than anyone
<br>
imagined. Perhaps it's no surprise that a pioneering center for
<br>
manipulating these tiny tools is the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory in
<br>
Switzerland, the birthplace of scanning probe microscopy. &quot;The whole
<br>
field was started right there,&quot; says Naomi Halas, a specialist in
<br>
applying nanotechnology to chemistry at Rice University in
<br>
Houston. One master cantilever builder at IBM Zurich is James
<br>
Gimzewski, leader of the Nanoscale Science group. He and his team set
<br>
the pace for the rest of the field, Halas says: &quot;When they publish
<br>
something, it is usually the first and best for a long time.&quot;
<br>
<p>The key to the next generation of cantilever devices is being able to
<br>
make the miniature planks bend on demand. One approach is to coat the
<br>
top surface of an AFM cantilever, a blade of silicon about 500
<br>
nanometers long and 100 nanometers wide, with short DNA chains called
<br>
oligonucleotides. The researchers next expose these coated
<br>
cantilevers, which are in solution, to oligonucleotides with a
<br>
complementary sequence of base pairs. When the matched pairs bind,
<br>
they exert an intermolecular force that expands the coating, bending
<br>
the cantilever downward much as the bimetallic strip in a thermostat
<br>
curls in response to temperature changes.
<br>
<p>A scanning laser can measure the extent to which the oligonucleotide
<br>
pairs bend the cantilever; the more base pairs that match, the more
<br>
the cantilever bends. Thus coated, cantilevers might serve as
<br>
sensitive probes for specific DNA sequences. &quot;We were able to detect a
<br>
single [base-pair] mismatch,&quot; says Gimzewski, whose team described its
<br>
advance in Science (14 April, p. 316). This proof of principle has
<br>
attracted attention from biotech companies, which view cantilever
<br>
setups as potential rivals to DNA arrays for searching for genetic
<br>
sequences of interest, including disease genes. &quot;We are now trying to
<br>
make [coated cantilevers] into a general-purpose diagnostic
<br>
technique,&quot; Gimzewski says. &quot;This is a new area. There aren't many
<br>
sensitive tools around.&quot;
<br>
<p>But cantilever-based devices need not be constrained to having the
<br>
action--or molecules--come to them.  They might be used as smart gates
<br>
that release drugs or other chemicals in response to precise molecular
<br>
signals. For instance, an anticancer pill equipped with cantilever
<br>
gates might unleash a powerful drug at the site of a tumor only when a
<br>
tumor-specific protein gloms onto a specially tailored molecular
<br>
adhesive coating the cantilevers. Or a chemical for cleaning up a
<br>
hazardous spill might be stored in pellets and released only when the
<br>
target pollutant tugs at a cantilever gate, &quot;rather than putting
<br>
chemicals all over the place,&quot; Gimzewski says.
<br>
<p>Closer to reaching the market, however, are cantilevers for computer
<br>
data storage. In a project called &quot;Millipede&quot; spanning several labs at
<br>
IBM Zurich, scientists are testing an array of about 1000 cantilevers
<br>
as a new way of building nanoscale memory devices. Piezoelectric
<br>
signals would tell the cantilevers when to jab their hot tips at a
<br>
polymer film. The impressions in the film would record the data in a
<br>
much denser format than current media do. &quot;That has the potential to
<br>
displace magnetic technologies,&quot; Gimzewski says. That bold prediction,
<br>
no doubt, will be heeded in the nano community: Gimzewski's group has
<br>
a track record for coming through. &quot;I always aim very high and fail a
<br>
lot of the time,&quot; he says, &quot;but the few things in which I succeed make
<br>
an impact and are extremely enjoyable.&quot;
