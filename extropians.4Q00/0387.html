<p>Alternatively government is a consequence of certain groups

gaining power before we had a fully developed market.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's analogous to Nozick's argument for the minimalist

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the network of rules which resulted would be laws,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that all the arbitration + law enforcement agencies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put together would, in fact, be a state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You might object: &quot;But you can opt out of a private

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you must choose to either consent to the law of the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent in every way.
</em><br>
<p>While it's true that not everyone can have their own laws, I
<br>
do think it would encourage greater diversity, if only in
<br>
places less connected to the 'network' (small towns for
<br>
example).  Personally I'm not a libertarian; anarcho-
<br>
capitalism appeals to me more because of its diversity than
<br>
its freedom.  If the climate changes, that diversity
<br>
translates to adaptability.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In light of this, I'm not convinced that anarcho-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism would, by itself, be better for anyone, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this market failure could and would just as easily happen
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; people got much much more upset about being governed, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decided they wanted freedom a lot more than they do today.
</em><br>
<p>The notable difference between this and the example you gave
<br>
of an argument for anarcho-socialism is that not everyone
<br>
has to want freedom more than they do today.  A powerful
<br>
minority would be enough.  You don't need a certain value
<br>
set to function in an anarcho-capitalist society (obviously
<br>
if you oppose anarcho-capitalism you might not like it, but
<br>
even then you could probably make a good living extolling
<br>
the virtues of socialism, the same would not be true of a
<br>
capitalist in a socialist or anarcho-socialist society).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Friedman's argument that AC wouldn't break down into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government requires me to want freedom more than you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to take it away from me;
</em><br>
<p>No, it requires the market to value freedom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; while this is true with some freedoms, as far as I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell, a few people want to take away some freedoms a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than many people want to keep them.  This doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logically imply government, since, in principle, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could sign away their rights while I kept mine pristine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but de facto government results.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt many people will be willing to pay to enforce 'laws'
<br>
that aren't directly applicable to them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This means that the project of bringing about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian society is not per se a political agenda, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list of political changes to make, so much as it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social agenda, a list of priorities which, if everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shared them, a freer, better and more moral society would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result.
</em><br>
<p>This is true.  However, anarcho-capitalism does not require
<br>
a libertarian society.
