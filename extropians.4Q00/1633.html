The Metamorphosis Society is looking for new members throughout the world.  They want through online discussions and email lists to bond together a group of folks who support cryonics and moving toward a positive future.  To my knowledge they charge nothing to join(but may not give out coffee mugs or t-shirts either!) and wish to start a groundswell in Japan and throughout the world to achieve their goals.  I have corresponded a little with some of the officers and they are good people who deserve our time.    
<br>
<p>sincerely,
<br>
<p>John
<br>
<p>check out their newly revamped website at...
<br>
<a href="http://www.kanon.to/ms.htm">http://www.kanon.to/ms.htm</a>
<br>
<p>taken from their website:
<br>
Metamorphosis Society is a mutual support group for people who want to do something for the betterment of the future and wish to &quot;go and see the future&quot; through cryopreservation and reanimation.
<br>
<p><p>Through active on-line discussion and exchange of views among a substantial number of members (hopefully at least 100), we may be able not only to increase the possibility of reanimation for cryopreserved patients but also to build a better future. If we keep the minimum number of 100 members for a long time, it will be a vital foundation to create even higher possibility of reanimation as well as to materialize an even better future.
<br>
<p><p>Metamorphosis Society is a non-profit organization established by Mizuho Hirose in January 1997.
<br>
We are a mutual support group for information exchange among our members, consisting of future-oriented people who are willing to transcend their present selves through &quot;metamorphosis.&quot;We are not a group established for the academic purpose.
<br>
<p>Metamorphosis Society aims at serving as a part of driving force to establish reanimation techniques, to make the techniques come into wide use and to make the techniques be provided at low prices.
<br>
The group dissolves when all group members (including current and future members) are reanimated.
<br>
We are all well aware that we have a very long way to attain these goals. For this reason, we made up the following short-term goals.
<br>
<p>As the first step toward our ultimate goals, reanimation and creating a better future, we are going to invite more people to join us from some existing groups as follows:
<br>
<p>1. groups of people who want to do something for the betterment of the future
<br>
2. groups of people who wish to &quot;go and see the future&quot; through cryopreservation and reanimation.
<br>
<p>Although we are a group for people who are interested in both of the above categories (#1 and #2), we do welcome people who are now interested in only one of them.
<br>
<p>Also, we are going to increase a chance of making human reanimation a reality by encouraging members (both people of #1 and #2) to help each other. Our current top priority mission is to invite more people to join our group. We believe that, the more people join and interact in our mailing list, the higher possibility of human reanimation emerges.
<br>
<p>If you are a person of #1 (e.g., most of the WFS members), we invite you to explore what #2 means. If you want to do something for the betterment of the future but have never really thought about going and seeing the future, why don't you think about it through the interaction with the people of #2?
<br>
<p>If you are a person of #2 (e.g., a cryonicist who only has a 'rosy dream' on nanotechnology but has never made any actual effort), we encourage you to explore what #1 means. Again, it is our belief that, the more active involvement you make in future-creating efforts in our group, the greater chance of reanimation you may have. To materialize this vision of ours, you will be asked to take some actions in your life.
<br>
<p>Regardless of categories you belong to, you will be able to have various kinds of latest information through on-line discussion.
<br>
<p>In this way, the speed of future-creating activities will be accelerated greatly. This will also bring you life with even better quality.
<br>
