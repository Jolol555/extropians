<p>USA.  ^_^

<p><em>&gt; I think a lot of the up-front money in the US gets spent in

</em><br>
<p>You think wrong.  Yes, it does take *some* money to approve a craft for
<br>
launch, but hardly $millions per test.  For a non-launch ground test,
<br>
just get some property sufficiently far from vulnerable stuff (say, a
<br>
nice little corner of the desert - or, for low enough power tests, a
<br>
large enough garage or warehouse) and do the test there, and the gov't
<br>
doesn't care.  Heck, one group once did a rocket engine test *in a
<br>
hotel conference room*; all they needed was permission from the hotel
<br>
staff and local fire marshal, not exorbitant fees.  (They also needed
<br>
previously and properly tested equipment; this &quot;test&quot; was more of a
<br>
demo and PR stunt than an engineering test...except for the social
<br>
engineering, of course.)
<br>
<p>Now, once you're testing launches, the fees do go up.  But...say you're
<br>
testing a spaceplane: first tests are with it tethered to the ground,
<br>
then some free flight, then eventually (assuming you've got the
<br>
engineering right) you'll get approval for that craft model to fly.
<br>
You may spend $millions over the entire development cycle, but most
<br>
likely, less than $1 million of that will go directly to the
<br>
government (at least, if one excepts income and sales taxes, and all
<br>
other fees and similar that apply equally to all businesses regardless
<br>
of industry, not just aerospace).
<br>
<p>And once you have a spaceplane that can legally take off and
<br>
land...well, filing a flight plan doesn't cost much.  Neither do
<br>
airport usage fees.  Your destination is orbital, and for that, the
<br>
only additional requirement is that you merely have to *tell* US Space
<br>
Command (I think that's the agency's name) your intended orbit and
<br>
activities, though it is strongly advised that you be willing to adjust
<br>
if you'd come too close to something else up there (avoidance of which
<br>
benefits you - as direct owner, if not pilot, of the craft which could
<br>
be destroyed by collision - much more than a large beauracracy which
<br>
could easily write off a few satellites if necessary).  It's not like
<br>
they have legal authority to sell you authorization to exit US
<br>
airspace...and so long as you don't touch any other country's stuff
<br>
(*especially* their soil - no prob, if you're in orbit), normal &quot;just
<br>
made an excursion to international areas and coming back home&quot; laws
<br>
apply upon return.
<br>
<p>There may be many US gov't disincentives to private space, but
<br>
excessive taxation and outright banning of private launches do not
<br>
count among them.  (Regulation, at the current level, is not outright
<br>
banning since it is possible for a company with zero political
<br>
influence to do a launch.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I guess you could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try launching from international waters but then you would have several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries after you AFAIK.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't seen any major country try to shoot down Sea Launch's
<br>
rockets, or even gripe that strongly about them.  Even if one grants
<br>
conspiracy theories about Boeing (SL's main backer) buying off the US
<br>
gov't, Russia and China are a bit less susceptible to bribes by US
<br>
corporations.
