Hey kids, check out his latest response in our ongoing conversation:
<br>
(I think I'll leave it to others to continue this conversation, since
<br>
he's acheived his goal of using far too many buzzwords for me to keep
<br>
complete track of. ;-)

<em>&gt; &gt; I understand what you are saying,

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *I'm not sure, from your letter you do. The Leftist assumptions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumptions about my commitment to Natural Man ala reconstituted Rousseau
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest you do not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, you apparently seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; approach the book with the blinders typical of leftist luddites (which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thank you for confessing your prejudice about).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *Not all Luddites are pidgeonholeable leftists. As a poet I often tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward the metaphoric ... my Ludditism is thus purely cosmetic. The word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roles well of the tongue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Framing the longevity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; issue and its science with blithe and tired dismissals like 'western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; materialism' 'capitalist opression' and other dead cliches of the failed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; communist/socialist movements of the past does you no credit, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nullifies the validity of your criticism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * In fact I am a curious blend of intellectual movemets with the radom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjectivity that goes with poetry  - 'Leftist' in the strictly socialist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Communist sense is not my ideological bag I'm afraid - Jungianism, Object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Relations Theory, Transpersonal Psychology as per Grof, Western Marxism (as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per Habermas and Giddens), Post-colonial Theory, mythopoetic (aimistic)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feminism, existentialism  are some of the main strands of my thinking ... I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also have a professional interest in developmental psychology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuropsychology  (especially the workings of the endorphin system) and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history of psychology/psychiatry,... if these are to be &quot;classified&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;dismissed&quot; out of hand (in a sweeping 'grand narrative' gesture) as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Leftist&quot; you would have to admit that they are nevertheless far removed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the dreary either/or (commuism/Capitalism) you accuse me of. Your use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the possibly offensive term 'primitivist fascism' (I'll reserve my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgement right now) I will come to in a moment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I find it odd that leftists like yourself tirelessly try to delineate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between the 'natural' characteristics of the natural kingdom while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; separating anything regarding man as 'artificial', and thus not natural.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * See notes RE: dreary commuism/capitalism debates above. I do actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make this delineation at all. Nothing is &quot;artificial&quot; to me - except most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US television shows, all is natural (even US TV shows) since they occur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naturally in nature. However, many things in nature are inhuman/anti-human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which I think is what many of those 'Lefties' Maye be getting at. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem with much scientific thinking - and Broderick deals with some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the monstrous aspects of science well in his book without properly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developing a systematic theory as to the reasons why so much science has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turned into human suffering - is that its idealistic universalistic claims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be the saviour of mankind exhibit a kind of dangerous niavety and thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack self-reflexiveness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The reason it lacks reflexiveness, I fancy, is because it has attempted at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every turn to disengage itself from the methodologies of the humanities, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is irritated by talk of science being accountable to morals, (what you call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;political correctness&quot;), democracy, long term evaluation, psychohistory,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc. It is also incapable of accepting the possibility that it's own way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking may in fact be the outcome of a species neurosis - despite being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implicated in some of the worst acts of inhumanity every perpetrated - who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will forget easily the scientists of the death camps? The scientists who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed the Atom Bomb and who right this mometn devote all their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'creative energies&quot; to developing news ways of destroying human life?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here Ellul is useful ... and Kuhn ... &quot;science is always ambivalent -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science is never disconnected from the scientific observer ... it is always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positioned never the whole truth&quot;. Which is to say it is always positioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within a cultural web - which is also to say it often creates as many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems as it solves ... its an &quot;eat the spider to catch the fly &quot; sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an invention of culture. When science - I'm going to quote a tired old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative poet here, Coleridge - refuses engagement with the humanities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of arrogance it risks becoming inhuman - it risks objectifying and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reifying the lifeworlds of real people and it pursues knowledge not for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; betterment of humankind but for the purposes of the death instinct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here in is my real critique of the kind of naive 'idealism' displayed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parts of Broderick's book in regard to the 'old age' question and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recent scientific advances. I am not, however, to be placed with those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would hold that the suffering of old age should not be lessened. I am only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very sceptical about the dehumanised reasoning that scientists use in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to tell me 'All will be well if we just get more funding to do as we please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... we have the Holy Grail' (of this or that) 'in our sights and it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fix everything&quot;. As you said in your email - &quot;old age is the cause of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatest suffering known to humankind&quot; and what caused the modern suffering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of old age? ... sad to say it was the 'advances' of science. Ellul is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proved worthy of engagement by your own logic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The real issue for me - the source of my uease about the scientists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; described in Broderisk's book - is the memetic infection doing the rounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of many scientists  - put another way, &quot;the personal and cultural neuroses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the scientist&quot;. When the unquestioning idealism of this memetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infection is allied with the conservative &quot;dump the losers on the streets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to beg&quot; 'individualism' of predatory capitalism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (corporatism/priviatisation/New Right conservatism etc.) we have a truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toxic &quot;green house gas&quot; type of mix.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you are to hold to this premise, you cannot conversely claim that man
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'shouldn't' live longer than his 'natural span'. By your own logic, man
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is a creature of artifice. We are self taught, not trapped by instinct,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and all of civilization is an exercise in letting lamarckian evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; supplant darwinian evolution. It should be, therefore, the natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consequence that man should seek to, and achieve, victory over death,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just as he has transcended his natural limits of speed, strength,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; endurance, immunity to disease and sickness, information processing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; storage, and gravity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *Ah, you have returned to the Old Age debate after neatly pidgeonholing me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a communist-Rousseauian Leftist Luddite with a tired old adherance to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20thC socialist grand narratives. See above notes. I do not hold the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naturalist premise, therefore it is not my logic. the memetic disease
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affecting many scientists is natural but must be opposed. Likewise, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critique of Broderick extended only to asking him and other apostles of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creed of science to take a more serious look at the moral, ethical,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socio-psychological issues surrounding not only the immortality quest but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the underlying motivations of much that passes for science these days. If,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the end of the day, there is genuine full debate and airing of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments, concerns, etc. and it can be proved that suffering really will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be decreased, and quality of life will be increased and there are no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ellullian side effects  and we will not be creating Frankensteins for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sake of our morbid Western fear of death (and living?) - which came with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christianity and the scourges of the 14th C - then the scientists might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Under the philosophy of western liberalism, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accepted that man is a transcendental being,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, as they say &quot;Clockwork Kant was beloved of a Rant&quot;, but he was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the only philosopher of Liberalism and, as they say, &quot;his noumenals are far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too ephemeral&quot; for many liberalists.  Hume, Locke, Hegel, Russell, etc. ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the philsophers of Liberalism are manifold and many are atheistic and thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-transcedentalist ... God help them &lt;grins&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet modern humanism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; showing less and less commonality to the liberal tradition, and what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the political left has drifted toward primitivist fascism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *I assume you are talking about Neitzsche's influence on postmodernist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Leftism - I do not find this critique offensive, just beside the point. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only concern I have is that you are idealising a American style Ayn Randian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of humanism with its absurdly inhuman attitudes toward the individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, if you are referring to the post-colonial strand in postmodernism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as 'primitivist' and 'fascist' ... then I do believe the infected memes are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calling ... the battle for Reconciliation in Australia by Aboriginal people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against 'progress' drunk White Australia is a particularly galling example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how the ew corporate conservatism can become barbarous, inhumane etc.. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feminist postmodernists, as an aside, are are often found in bed, some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would say 'wearing the ring', of that old Nazi Neitzsche ... the man who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said &quot;If you are going out and are likely to end up in the company of women
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... remember your whip.&quot; Here the progress drunk side of feminism matched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the progress drunk side of capitalism matched the progress drunk side of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resulted in leftist opposition to genetic engineering to feed the hungry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or cure the sick, space exploration to find new resources or to colonize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; space, or any sort of technological development that is not vetted by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the star chambers of political correctness as 'appropriate technology'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * See above notes on the innate fascism of many scientists who have zero
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect for democratic institutions (prefering to 'influence' them through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporate lobbying of politicians), also zero respect for community
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerns about the ecological, social, etc. consequeces (risks?) of many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so-called scientific 'advances', and instead behave like kids with matches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whenever they spot something that hasn't been tried (they often use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word 'conquered' much as you favour the word 'colonising' when it comes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space)  and though potentially dangerous to humanity might also turn a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profit for the corporations they increasigly turn tricks for. Also, to wear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a leftist hat for a moment, the GEngineering debate in Australian has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a classic of this kind of 'Techo-Eco Rationalist fascism&quot; Consumers were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; told &quot;Eat it or else ... we invented it so you'll eat it ... and you'll eat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it without us having to tell you what we've mutated it with  ...&quot; and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;That corn tastes kind of spidery!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I really don't want to get into one more tired debate over capitalism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; versus communism or any of its less completely malignant pathologies. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will leave it with the statement that there is no 'pathology' described
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; above which has not demonstrated itself to be more malignant under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; communist or socialist sytems, and you will not find any evidence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contradict this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *And that is because Communism, like Information Age, anti-democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism, does not respect truly transparent democracy ... it (Karl M)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was also far too idealistic about science - 19th century science at that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with all its dreary mechanistic conceptions. A recipe for disaster - since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dictatorialism of Enlightment spawned communism became allied with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innate dictatorialism of Bacon's scientific method.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moreover, as any advocate for the elderly can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tell you, old age is, in fact, the greatest scourge on our society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; After some point health care costs nearly double with each additional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; year of life. This drain of resources to maintain an unproductive member
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of society (far in excess of those resources contributed in the past to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that society, in fact, since the average retiree consumes their lifetime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Social Security savings in less than 3.5 years) stagnates the ecnonomy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; retards investment in improving technology to be less stressful on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environment, and increases unemployment, illiteracy, child and spouse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; abuse, etc. It is a fair thing to say that the drain on the marginal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; productivity of society caused by old age is the prime cause of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; difficulty we have found with solving what you categorize as 'capitalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pathologies'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *I'm sorry but the above paragraph reads as far to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objectified/materialistic etc. for me - the memes of Guenon's 'Reign of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quantity' are in full flight and dehumanising and reifying the experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Old Age into mere economic categories only - another offspring of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bourgeois Liberalism - is ascendant. Besides, you've merely proved that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eating the scientific spider in order to prolong old age (to kill the fly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of early death) has produced massive suffering ... now you want me to trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the scientists to fix it this time!!! Forgive me if I say ... &quot;Brodericks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book though humanistic is deeply flawed in that a whole dimension of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning has been ignored which would need to be considered if I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that what the white-coated nutters are up to this time will really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help human beings who are suffering as they grow old.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I consider Damien to be a friend,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * I intuited this early in the piece - I've had dozens of fascinating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emails about that review - no others attacked with such venom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I also consider him to be far too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; willing to grant the benefit of the doubt to political persuasions that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have repeatedly proven themselves to be dependent on defunct concepts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; zero and negative sum games, and  willing to debase the individual that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; does not serve to their advantage. Damien is a far more tolerant person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than I.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * I imagine that Damien is well aware that down here in Australia the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alliance of predatory late consumer capitalism with technocratic science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has spawned a new breed of rightwing political ad administrative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philistines intent on emptying the universities of creative thinkers such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as himself. Where do they go? To the privatised jails down the street ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since they are not needed in the new techno-eco-rationalist superstate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * The debate has been no holds barred and fun.
