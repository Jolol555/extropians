<p><em>&gt;Thanks, but I'm still not back to the fitness level I had 15 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ago. When I hit that pace again, I'll be sure to brag here. :-)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;For everybody else, we're talking about training based on maximum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;heart rate formulas, the formula:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;220-age=maximum heart rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;220-age X 65%= start of training range.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;220-age X 85%= top end of normal training range
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I've been suspicious of the validity of this guide for a while,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even though it's very commonly cited. While I was at Kronos, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expressed my doubts to the exercise specialist, noting that I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;measured my heart rate above the age-related theoretical maximum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;She agreed, saying that it wasn't a reliable guide. I expect it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a reasonable first cut so that people have an idea of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;training range, but if you've been exercising consistently I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think you can go higher than those ranges.
</em><br>
<p>Thats a good, point, still an excellent place to start.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm 36 (37 in two months), so my maximum would supposedly be 220
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- 36 = 184, but I *know* my maximum is significantly higher than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that. I aim to keep my heart rate no higher than 175 (though I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like to finish by pushing myself harder, moving it up into the 180
</em><br>
<em>&gt;range). Since I can sustain that for my 23-35 minutes runs I must
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be in the aerobic zone, though at the upper range for much of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;run. I'll probably stop pushing myself quite so hard once I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;improve to a 7.0 minute per mile pace -- still below what I did 15
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years ago.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I think that max rate number is the safety rate for your
<br>
average person.
<br>
<p>I did the 3 mile run in Marine corp boot Camp at 19:30 in combat
<br>
boots on a sandy course (San Diego) but we can forget those kinds
<br>
of numbers (there were about 35 people ahead of me! a couple
<br>
finished under 18:00!). A bunch of years ago I had an ultrasound
<br>
done on my heart, that revealed a leaky valve. Nothing serious they
<br>
say but it could limit my efficiency by as much as 20%. All the
<br>
more reason to work out I say.
<br>
<p>Learn anything else interesting at Kronos?
