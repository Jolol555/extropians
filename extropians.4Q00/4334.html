</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The Matrix is the best sci-fi action movie... *ever*:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1. The Matrix
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Oh, Emlyn.  What to do with you?
</em><br>
<p>Yikes.
<br>
<p>Fun flicks, but your list betrays, it must be said, a preference for style
<br>
over substance.  (Both T2 and A2 were flashy sequels to gritty, substantive,
<br>
genre defining movies.)
<br>
<p>However, lets face it, with regards to the genre in question, style IS a
<br>
major issue.  And I *really* liked all the movies on your list.  Big time.
<br>
However, I'd have to say that the top three movies that had the most impact
<br>
on the genre of sci-fi action, left the biggest ripples, and are, really,
<br>
the best three of all time, are:
<br>
<p>1.  The Empire Strikes Back
<br>
<p>Ok, I'm cheating here.  Star Wars did it first.  But this is where Lucas
<br>
really got it right.  No other single movie has as successfully transported
<br>
us to a universe so epic, so mythical, and so tremendously rich of story and
<br>
milieu.  ATATs storming the surface of Hoth, Luke in the caves of Dagobah
<br>
(creepy,) The Imperial pursuit into the asteroid field, Cloud City-- and
<br>
were you aware that Darth Vader is Luke's father?!  Dude, The Matrix has
<br>
got -nothing- on this baby.
<br>
<p><p>2.  Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan
<br>
<p>Again, a sequel, but we all know the first one sucked.  Why's this on my
<br>
list?
<br>
<p>a.) Two words: STAR TREK.  This is one of the big grand daddys of the genre.
<br>
'Nuff said.
<br>
b.) Epic Cinematic Storytelling.  This one turns the screws on you right at
<br>
the start and doesn't let up.  Ricardo is totally and cunningly over the
<br>
top-- one of the finest super-villains of all time.  The space-ship battles
<br>
in this one *still* look good. (Go figure.  Makes you realize that CG still
<br>
has a long ways to go.)  The score in this movie kicks ass-- epic
<br>
gladiatorial space combat opera.  The action is -smart-, they keep throwing
<br>
in little twists to keep you on your toes.  Things crawl into people's ears!
<br>
Spock dies!
<br>
<p>If you haven't seen this one in a while, do yourself a favor, grab the DVD
<br>
and turn the volume up.
<br>
<p><p>3a.)  Brazil.
<br>
<p>Okay, this one's personal preference: it clearly didn't have big-time impact
<br>
on the genre.  In fact, it probably doesn't even qualify as Sci-Fi action.
<br>
But this is a brilliant, brilliant movie and one of my all time favorites of
<br>
all time favoriteness.
<br>
<p>3b.) The Matrix
<br>
<p>Seldom has a movie so clearly captured, redefined and cinemized the action
<br>
sensibilities of its era.  This flick -oozes- savvy style.  The
<br>
cinematography!  John Gaeta should be made President.  The script is not
<br>
particularly brilliant, but lord, the implementation...!  Here's the flick
<br>
that makes green filters, flo-motion, mirrored surfaces, black leather and
<br>
cell phones impossibly cool.  It will likely be remembered as the defining
<br>
Virtual Reality flick, and it will be endlessly copied.  But why, oh why,
<br>
are they making a sequel to this movie?!
<br>
<p><p><p>Runners Up:
<br>
<p>Blade Runner -- Wow.  This is one of the best looking and sounding movies of
<br>
all time.  Probably will be for the foreseeable future.  Repeat: wow.
<br>
Alien -- The first, best, creepiest, most atmospheric monsters-in-space
<br>
movie ever.
<br>
T2 -- This movie kicks ass; who needs a plot when you've got Arnie and
<br>
unrelenting action?
<br>
Back to the Future -- I LOVED this movie.  I still do.  Come on dude, it's
<br>
got a time traveling DeLorean.
<br>
Highlander -- Is this Sci-Fi?  A *classic.*
<br>
Clockwork Orange -- This one got in my head.
