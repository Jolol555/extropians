&quot;Laughter is the best medicine,&quot; according to the
<br>
Reader's Digest.
<br>
<p>Your comment has provided a day's dose of mirth.

<br>
<p><p>James, I’m glad to be of assistance, all those extra
<br>
moments of life add up &amp; raise your odds of making it
<br>
to the singularity:)
<br>
After undertaking Ralph Lewis’s risk assessment:
<br>
(Weight of risk) = (severity of harm) x (probability
<br>
of occurrence)
<br>
(Propagation of a flawed system) =(propagation of a
<br>
flawed system) x (100%)
<br>
I decided it would be worth a check up just to have
<br>
the last laugh, as the Doc officially gives me at
<br>
least 50 years more life. (smug grin) 
<br>
Incidentally think the CR life extension method works
<br>
on the basis that if you have less energy, you do
<br>
less. If you do less you live longer. IMO boring, if
<br>
not defeatist.
