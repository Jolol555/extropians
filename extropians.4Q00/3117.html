Note carefully that it's &quot;Dynegy&quot;, *not* &quot;Dynergy&quot;.
<br>
<p>Some &quot;powerplant&quot; sites list www.dynergy.com, but that turns out to be a
<br>
website for some sort of Metabolife-like product. Eeesh.
<br>
<p>I wanted to find out their stock ticker symbol. :) It looks like they
<br>
are working on a DRIP plan site. Hee hee hee.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The truly cool thing about this technology is 
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;plug-and-play&quot; construction.  You can slap one together in SIX MONTHS 
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; and the trend in power generation is a no-brainer to figure out.
</em><br>
<p>Amen!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Beyond this, the new breed of energy merchants like Dynegy (am I proud of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them or what?) are in the process of completely revolutionizing the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *culture* of energy production in the world.  They're completely undermining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the old, slow, heavily regulated monopoly utility way of doing business and,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the process, have laid the groundwork for a new way of looking at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over-all energy grid and market so that ANY new energy sources can be plugged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in at ANY level. Thus, as new, smaller-scale generation nodes become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologically feasible (think home- and neighborhood-scale fuel cell and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solar plants), the &quot;grid&quot; (in the broadest sense, including not just the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical infrastructure, but also the market network) can accommodate them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This was unthinkable just ten years ago.
</em><br>
<p>What if they gave a monopoly and *everybody* came? 
<br>
<p>The dislocations people are whining about in the power industry are
<br>
real, and short-term, pure electricity consumers are feeling a pinch;
<br>
California's legislature is getting pushed to reregulate. Let's see what
<br>
plans they have for cogeneration, and who is greasing the wheels, shall
<br>
we?
<br>
<p>Looking,
<br>
<p>Mike
