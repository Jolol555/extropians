<p>Excerpted from <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/rre/1345">http://www.egroups.com/message/rre/1345</a> -- Phil always makes 
<br>
for very interesting reading, though I haven't devoted enough thought to 
<br>
this post to make up my mind whether I agree or not. Seems reasonable, 
<br>
though. YMMV.

<br>
<p>A theory of the Internet stock bubble.
<br>
<p>I have a theory of the Internet stock bubble.  A technical standard
<br>
such as TCP/IP or HTTP is a coordination mechanism: it helps people
<br>
to interrelate their activities with much less negotiation than they
<br>
would otherwise need.  Establishing a standard is a major coordination
<br>
problem, since a critical mass of users have to be persuaded that
<br>
a critical mass of users will actually adopt the standard.  But once
<br>
that condition is achieved, everyone can go on back to work and the
<br>
standard will keep everyone interoperating.  A standard thus creates
<br>
wealth in society, and the big economic question is who will capture
<br>
that wealth.  The answer to this question will depend on many factors.
<br>
It might be a single vendor who captures all of the wealth through
<br>
its proprietary control of the standard, or else it might be content
<br>
providers who withhold their intellectual property until they can
<br>
extract rents from everyone else.  It might be the early adopters
<br>
who won't use the standard unless they get subsidies from the vendor.
<br>
It might be the applications developers.  Underneath every standard is
<br>
a hidden struggle among all of these players, each of them trying to
<br>
capture the largest slice of the pie by adjusting the standard itself
<br>
or the legal or contractual arrangements around it.  The winner will
<br>
be determined by a hundred factors: who is best organized, who can
<br>
leverage their control of existing standards, who has other options
<br>
they can choose, who can wait, who has money in the bank, who has the
<br>
manufacturing capabilities, who happens to think of the idea first,
<br>
and so on.  If the players push too hard then the standards process
<br>
can fail altogether, leaving no pie at all to divide.  It's quite a
<br>
complicated game.
<br>
<p>By coordinating a vast number of diverse activities, the Internet
<br>
creates enormous wealth.  So it stands to reason that large numbers of
<br>
investors have tried to cut themselves a slice of the pie by providing
<br>
capital to one or more of the players.  Some of them, obviously, have
<br>
succeeded, such as the early investors in Cisco.  But an huge number
<br>
of them have failed, and it's interesting to consider why.  Despite
<br>
its great fame, as standardization processes the Internet is wildly
<br>
atypical.  In the Internet's case, one player, the philosopher-kings
<br>
at ARPA, held nearly all the cards; they were the smartest, richest,
<br>
best-organized, and most prescient of anyone, and they chose to rig
<br>
the game to ensure that almost all of the wealth went to the ordinary
<br>
users, that is, the taxpayers.  This poses a problem for the players
<br>
who want bigger slices of the pie than they get just from having a
<br>
computer on their desk.  The pie is sliced so thinly that it's almost
<br>
impossible to assemble a large slice.  Some people have done it, of
<br>
course, but even the billionaires of Silicon Valley have captured a
<br>
tiny proportion of the entire wealth that the Internet has created.
<br>
<p>The rest of the wealth is out there, of course, but to capture it you
<br>
have to come up with an investment strategy that separates the value
<br>
of the Internet from all of the other factors that affects investments
<br>
in particular contexts.  For example, you could invest in whichever
<br>
auto company is doing the best job of using the Internet, but then
<br>
you're exposed to all of the other issues that affect auto companies.
<br>
Investors, therefore, are looking for the &quot;pure plays&quot; that depend
<br>
on nothing except the success of the Internet.  And this is where the
<br>
Internet stock bubble comes from: the amount of capital that is out
<br>
there chasing Internet stocks is probably not out of line, given the
<br>
amount of wealth that the Internet has created.  It's just that the
<br>
capital is all squeezing into a tiny portion of the space where that
<br>
wealth is getting created.  There's only so much Cisco to go around.
<br>
<p>This all leads to the only proven method of making money by investing
<br>
in high technology: do a huge amount of research until you identify
<br>
the standards that are going to build critical masses, analyze the
<br>
players and their strategies, and put your money on the player that is
<br>
going to capture most of the wealth.  If you arrive too late then that
<br>
player will already have enough capital to grow on its own steam, and
<br>
in that case you should walk away.  Two years ago you should have been
<br>
studying the players in optical networking.  And now?  Well, if you
<br>
were reading about it here then you'd be too late.  That's the point.
<br>
