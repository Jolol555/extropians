<p><em>&gt; I've seen the phrase bandied about.  Not sure of its meaning.  What do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean by &quot;meta-programming?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Who programs the programmer?
<br>
<p>The idea is that you can reprogram yourself, change the habits, ways
<br>
of thinking or beliefs you have by going into a special state where
<br>
they become fluid and you can reset them. I guess the the term
<br>
originates with John Lilly in his book _Programming and
<br>
Metaprogramming the Human Biocomputer_. Robert Anton Wilson did a lot
<br>
of popularization of this idea (cf. _Prometheus Rising_).
<br>
<p>In my view (as a computational neuroscientist interested in learning),
<br>
the idea isn't bad at all. My main problem with it is that most of the
<br>
drugs around produce states that may produce a very fluid view of
<br>
reality, but they also make the users so confused that it is hard for
<br>
them to do the desirable changes. I think (the early) Leary and others
<br>
meant that this was why psychedelics should only be used in a clinical
<br>
setting where an expert helped the user to exploit the state.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a neuroscience point of view, the drugs also seem to be a bit
</em><br>
crude when it comes to modulating plasticity. Ideally, we should have
<br>
drugs that affected only some of the memory and learning systems so
<br>
that the effects were more directed and less prone to random
<br>
inprinting. Here I think current memory research will produce a lot of
<br>
interesting chemicals over the next years as the biochemistry of
<br>
memory continues to be discovered (what a wonderful time to work in!
<br>
things are happening *fast* right now!  :-).
<br>
<p>Personally I think other means such as self-hypnosis and
<br>
self-suggestion (enhanced for example by ritual) can be even very
<br>
useful metaprogramming tools.
