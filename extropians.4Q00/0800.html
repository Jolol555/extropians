<em>&gt; Not to get the whole shouting match started again - but HCI has been known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to present garbage numbers from time to time. Their avowed purpose is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; removal of all privately held weapons, not &quot;handgun control&quot;. I take all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their figures with a large block of salt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At all the shows I have been to, the &quot;unlicensed&quot; dealers accounted for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small percentage of those present. They had small quantities of weapons, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any - most had accessories and parts, but not complete guns. Those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanted to sell guns had to abide by all State of Illinois and federal laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are enough ATF agents provocateur and snitches out there to make life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miserable for anyone cutting corners. Licensed dealers have too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invested to want to risk it all on a few bucks from illegal sales.
</em><br>
<p>HCI considers any private individual who sells their private guns to be an
<br>
'unlicensed dealer'. While some states may outlaw private sales, most do not,
<br>
and consider it unconstitutional to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All Illinois waiting periods are also strictly enforced. It's a quick ride
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to jail if you try to bypass them and get caught.
</em><br>
<p>While the number of people proven to have been killed due to waiting periods is
<br>
higher than those shown to have been saved...
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interesting aside - a local (Colorado) reporter supposedly has information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that someone called the local hospital on an official emergency line over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an hour before the shooting started - warning them to be ready for &quot;bomb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and gunshot&quot; victims. Government conspiracy, anyone?
</em><br>
<p>I would LOVE to hear more about this...
