<em>&gt; The story is actually more complicated than it appears on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surface.  This is NOT a story about implementing price caps which are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doomed to fail.  This is actually a story about an attempt at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deregulation that appears to have failed.  California actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deregulated the industry and predicted that free-market competition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would make prices fall.  Instead, prices skyrocketed and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price-gouging abounds.  After spiraling costs continued to grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out-of-control, the state decided to cap prices at their more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable levels.  The state basically is telling the deregulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies that they must produce power cheaper than the state can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce its own power, or else they are pricing themselves out of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market.  This is how the free-market is supposed to work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What went wrong with deregulation?  Why did the deregulated companies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not produce power cheaper than the regulated government monopoly?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because the deregulated industry was not really a free market.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state of California was a captive marketplace which had to purchase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the power by law.  There was no customer feedback to reject prices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when they got too high.  Instead of high-priced companies losing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market-share, this deregulated environment ensured market-share to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all power producers no matter how high their prices got.  Naturally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices kept going up and up with no end in sight.
</em><br>
<p>You are missing the key thing Harvey, which is why my emphasis: The
<br>
market fluctuated out of control because government mechanisms that
<br>
prevented any new local suppliers from providing power to be built
<br>
unless they were 'renewable' sources like wind and solar power which are
<br>
highly variable and do not synchronize with peak power demands.
<br>
<p>There was nothing 'wrong' with deregulation. What was wrong is that the
<br>
distribution and demand sides of the market got deregulated, while the
<br>
supply side of the market did not.
