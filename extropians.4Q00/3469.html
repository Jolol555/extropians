<em>&gt; &quot;Most successful mass stuff like this&quot;? Name three other things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coding an HTML web page. Name five.
</em><br>
<p>Urm, ok, generic applications like Word, Excel, etc. Simple, sometimes
<br>
grubby, really easy to get something half baked together.
<br>
<p>VB programming. I leave as an exercise for the other coders here to explain
<br>
this one.
<br>
<p>The english language. Half stuffed, jammed full of extra features and
<br>
doodads, much of the complexity cloberred over years of being a peasant
<br>
language, and now in the role of global language. I'm no linguist, but
<br>
people interested in such things have said to me that English is relatively
<br>
easy to get up to minimum speed on, and comparatively difficult to master.
<br>
Sound familiar?
<br>
<p>Stuff like this, &quot;successful mass stuff&quot;, must not retain elegance which
<br>
makes it at all complex. The main criteria is that you can throw together a
<br>
half baked sentence/document/program/page, and it'll work enough. Doing the
<br>
big, hard stuff, requires a real expert (moreso than with something well
<br>
designed). And when I say &quot;you&quot;, I don't mean &quot;you&quot;, I mean the least
<br>
competent interested person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no question that the Web
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has succeeded. And so most people put up with all the things wrong with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it--&quot;404 not found&quot; being one of the biggest. No rotten fruit to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thrown at you--you're eating it. And so am I. Every damned day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That's funny, I find it pretty tasty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not sour grapes, though. :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It's a bit more like gravy, as far as I can see.
<br>
