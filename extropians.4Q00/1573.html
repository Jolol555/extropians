I've been reading some of the Ian M. Banks &quot;Culture&quot; novels which were
<br>
recommended here.  His first one is Consider Phlebas, the tale of a war
<br>
between the Culture and the Idirans, religious fanatic xenophobe aliens.
<br>
A Culture Mind has been stranded, and a group led by an Idiran-supporting
<br>
shapeshifter is hoping to capture it and hand it over to its enemies.
<br>
<p>All through the book I kept waiting to learn what &quot;Phlebas&quot; means, but it
<br>
was never explained, or I missed it.
<br>
<p>I found that there is a Socratic dialog called Philebas which is of
<br>
some possible relevance.  It is a debate about which is best: pleasure
<br>
or wisdom.  Socrates takes the side of wisdom, and Philebas advocates
<br>
pleasure, but Philebas has apparently skipped out (probably because
<br>
Socrates always wins) and another guy gets to take the fall.
<br>
<p>The Culture is devoted to the idea that pleasure is the greatest good,
<br>
in contrast, I think, to most Earthly (and Extropian for that matter)
<br>
philosophers who would choose wisdom.  The Culture has pretty much given
<br>
up on wisdom, at least for humans; that's the machines' job.  This is
<br>
largely why the main character hates the Culture and wants the Idirans
<br>
to win, despite their violence and arrogance; at least they are seeking
<br>
to better themselves.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately for this explanation, Phlebas and Philebas are not spelled
<br>
the same.  Anyone know the true meaning of the phrase, Consider Phlebas?
<br>
