<em>&gt; &gt;Neither do I. So long as self defense is acceptable, but initiation &gt;of force is unacceptable, self defense will act as a natural &gt;governor on the initiation of force.

Note that in many instances of police &gt;strikes, crime tends to DROP, because criminals are more afraid of &gt;citizens taking things into their own hands than the possibility of &gt;police cruelty.

<em>&gt; Being a dedicated non-libertarian, I usually lurk and bite my tongue through these exchanges, but this time I really can't resist offering a different perspective. These scenarios seem to me to be totally unrealistic. Sure, you may be a bad mofo now, but what about when you're 80? When I'm aged and/or infirm (still a very real possibility, regretably) will I still be even capable of handling a .357? I'll probably just want to call a well trained police force (which, by the way, I think I could make a strong case should remain part of the government function). Even if I somehow retain my ability to defend myself from ne'er-do-wells, or always have others to do it for me, into the foreseeable future there will continue to exist people for one reason or other on the margins. I don't really want to construct a society that says, &quot;You're on you own.&quot;

<p>Mike replies:
<br>
Many instances of self defense occur with elderly people. This
<br>
technology does not depend on physical strength, its an equalizer, not
<br>
an emphasizer of strength. Moreover, if YOU choose to live in a gated
<br>
community with its own security (as most seniors do already), then that
<br>
is YOUR CHOICE, but you won't have forced the same choice on everyone
<br>
else who is not in a position requiring some sort of dependency on
<br>
others.
<br>
<p>Understand this: Society ALREADY says &quot;You are on your own&quot;. Society is
<br>
only interested in catching and imprisoning someone after you are dead.
<br>
Police are not there for protecting individuals, and have no
<br>
responsibility to, they are there to catch people after the fact. In
<br>
many instances, police expend more energy protecting criminals from
<br>
justly irate victims and other citizens. They are bodyguards for crooks
<br>
(in and out of government).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, my bs detector started to tingle when it was suggested that crime declines during a police strike. That would be an interesting phenomenon, but does not seem to be the norm by any means. Please check out the summary of relevant studies at <a href="http://www.ncjrs.org/works/chapter8.htm">http://www.ncjrs.org/works/chapter8.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p>Mike continues:
<br>
A pro-government document, found on a government site for  a government
<br>
department that funds studies that perpetuate government controlled
<br>
groupthink. Oh, yeah, thats an unbiased source.
<br>
<p>Since this is straying into PIC areas, it might be better to move this
<br>
to exi-freedom if we want to continue on this thread...
