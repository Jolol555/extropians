<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: &lt;tap, tap&gt; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: go away. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: &lt;tap&gt; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: go away. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: &lt;tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap&gt; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: mother of bleeding christ, is there NO PEACE? not even in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;HERE? why can't you just GO AWAY and let me rot in solitude?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;aren't you content with alienating my friends, spending all my
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;money and, for the sake of the goddess, chat-fucking eddie clulow
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in fidonet? EDDIE CLULOW? have you no sense of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;RESPONSIBILITY? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: i wanted to talk to you about this doctor thing. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: (long, drawn-out sigh) what about it? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: are you really - 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: YES, i am really. i don't think it'll do any good at first, but, hey,
<br>
you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;never know. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: but what if he decides that you're a voice in my head instead of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the other way round? what if he gets rid of you?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: (enthusiastically) then i'll be at peace. either way, i can't lose.
<br>
and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if he does remove me instead, then, heh, you'll have to deal with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the real world instead of me. you'll have to face up to responsibility.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;no more of that chatting up guys and then running away when they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;get interested. no more spending the rent money on hardback
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;editions of John Shirley horror books. no more hanging up the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;phone on my friends while i'm talking to them and then saying &quot;oh,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it was one of the other Aspects, not me&quot; and then interrupting when
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;i try to apologise and explain what happened.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: not that anyone believes you. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;m: excuse me! am i interrupting? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;n: YES
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;m: oh, good. who was it spent $38 on that Hematite ring at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Morticia's and then wrote in the diary that i did it? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: (taps fingers on arm) 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: well, you're the goth, mirikai. are you saying you didn't do it?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;m: what do you mean, &quot;I'M the goth&quot;? while we're discussing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;finances, who was it spent sixty dollars on three metres of black
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vinyl for a Cenobite costume?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: ... 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: possibly the same Aspect who picked up that leaflet from Slow
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Glass, about the Costumer's Ball in June. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;m: i only spend money on alcohol at Abyss. i can see no nobler
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;purpose for money than this. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: if i lose any more brain cells, it's coming out of your patch.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;m: aaaah ha ha hah. &quot;i see you have made your decision. now, let's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;see you enforce it.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d&quot; see? Crow quotes! you're a goth!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;m: and you're a pain. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: you're BOTH pains. why can't you leave the disbursment of funds
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to me? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: maybe we don't want to spend all of our money on tiny little silver
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;grommets from sewing supplies shops. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: yeah? i noticed you suddenly got very interested when i said i
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;was going to use them in making a corset for Jabberwok. i might
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;even be able to get rid of some of that black vinyl. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: are you going to let your m- 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;p: excuse us. we're thirsty. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(pause while a 1-litre `Pepsi Max Big Slam' bottle is fetched from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the freezer. it has four centimetres of icy, half-frozen water at the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;bottom; the bottle is topped up and drunk, the cold causing intense
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;pain in the fillings of our teeth) 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: and how long have you been listening in, Mr Natural? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;p: (rasps) &quot;we've always been here.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: oy. still think you're a Cenobite, huh?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;p: (sneers) still think you're female, huh? looked in the mirror
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;recently, dava? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: okay. that's it. where's that fucking X-acto knife? i'll settle this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;once and for all. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;m: (bemusedly, to n) you think she'll do it? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: (laughs) nah. she doesn't see pain the way we do. she'll press
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the knife about half a millimetre into the skin and then chicken out.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;remember when she wanted to impress Skud and tried to pierce
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;her nipple? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;m: heh. it was a dance, like the Lucrezia back-and-forth two-step.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;needle touches skin, retreats, touches skin, retreats - 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: (sobs) you bastards are always ganging up on me. maybe i
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;should just throw myself in front of a fucking bus. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;m: maybe you should, dava. it would be a nice touch if you could do
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it without involving us. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: oh no. when i go, i'm taking you all with me. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: what is it, that time of the month? dava, aren't you content with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;making me feel stomach-cramping phantom period pains? you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;have to do the whole hormonal roller-coaster thing as well? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: why should i have all the fun? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;p: indeed. we want to reserve next wednesday. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: why? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: no. i know what you want to do, and i don't think you should. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;p: shut up, child; this isn't a democracy. very well. we recommend
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that no-one should make any definite plans for wednesday, as we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;will be assuming control as of seven thirty pm. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: (quietly) i'll fight you for it. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;p: (incredulous) you'll what? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;m: oh, this'll be good. blinding headaches at ten paces. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: i said i'll fight you for it. i'm not going to let you confuse her
<br>
any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;further. you wouldn't listen to me when i said, `leave her be', would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you? you're like a child, picking at a scab until it bleeds. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;p: (sneers) it's not hard to see where the poetry comes from, is it? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: (derisiviely) what would you know? you couldn't write a poem to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;save your life. that requires emotional involvement. you might have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;heard of that, somewhere, but you wouldn't recognise it if someone
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rammed a metric tonne of it up your ass with a fucking pile-driver. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;p: (to n) it must be that time of the month again. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;m: why don't we install nethack, run it and see if it tells us what
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;phase of the moon we're in? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: (pause) i beg your pardon? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;m: (somewhat embarassed) i mean... i thought, uh, that sort of - i
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;thought it was associated with the phases of the moon... 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;d: (rolls eyes) and you wanted to be female? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;n: (to the outside world in general) and people wonder why i have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;trouble dealing with reality.
