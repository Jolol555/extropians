Thank you for the links, Doug.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...but they aren't original with him.  Twenty years ago Robert 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Forward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; described a fractal robot working in the garden aboard a starship- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea ain't new, or even startling. 
</em><br>
<p>Maybe not startling, but it's something that's newly within the realm of
<br>
near-future possibility. Not just microrobots but also larger scale
<br>
agricultural machines that could handle rows and beds of different widths
<br>
and heights and could use discrimination in planting and harvesting,
<br>
thereby eliminating the incentive for large scale monocropping. It would
<br>
be a completely different and vastly better way of producing food and
<br>
other agricultural products. 
<br>
<p>To me this is exciting, whenever or by whomever it was first voiced or
<br>
set down in writing.
<br>
And the fact that so many people seem to believe that one MUST use toxic
<br>
pesticides in order to grow food indicates that the possibilities are NOT
<br>
generally appreciated, even among people on this list.
