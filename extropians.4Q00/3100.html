<p>
Extropes,
<br>
<p>The predicted instability of the solid version of the dyson sphere has been
<br>
a source of disappointment for moi ever since I heard about it.  The idea
<br>
of the fully enclosed star was so delightful to me, and so elegant, that I
<br>
pondered long over the matter seeking some remedy, some bit of phenomenon
<br>
to rescue me from my despair.  I considered the predicted instability, and
<br>
concluded that it was factually supported, but based on +considerations of
<br>
gravity and gravity alone.  Gravity, to the exclusion of all other forces
<br>
in the universe, as if no other forces existed.  Fortuitously, this is not
<br>
the case.  Also fortuitously, the gravitational 'instability' is neutral.
<br>
That is, gravity does not actively drive the system to collapse, but rather
<br>
stands by, having no effect at all.  This is in contrast to orbital
<br>
dynamics, where gravitational forces and inertial forces (centripetal
<br>
force) actively balance each other to create stability.  At the risk of
<br>
repeating myself, the alleged instability (more precisely an absence of the
<br>
oh-so-familiar gravitationally-mediated stability of orbital systems) is
<br>
concluded to exist, because gravitational effect, by virtue of the
<br>
mass-within-a-spherical-shell configuration, is nullified.  Ok.  Fine.
<br>
With gravity, the 800 pound gorilla of the cosmic neighborhood, out of the
<br>
picture, I can look to other forces for the stability I seek.  Second order
<br>
forces, as it were.  To put it just a bit more strongly, in the absence of
<br>
gravitational effect, other forces, insofar as they come into play, MUST
<br>
determine the dynamics--and with it the stability or instability--of the
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>Now that I have hand-recounted the ballots in this matter, I see that I
<br>
have two candidates available to undertake the task of stabilizing my Dyson
<br>
sphere.  The first is clearly qualified.  I've looked him/her over
<br>
carefully and s/he seems ready to deliver the goods.  The second is either
<br>
a spoiler or a helper, I don't know which, perhaps you all can help me
<br>
figure out that part. 
<br>
<p>Radiation pressure, baby.  It ain't big, but it's real.
<br>
<p>Solar radiation on the interior of the sphere will tend to drive the sphere
<br>
so that the center of the sphere describes an 'orbit' around the star.  To
<br>
see why this is so, consider what happens if the star is off-center.  The
<br>
portion of the sphere nearest the star has the greater density of incident
<br>
photons to both absorb and reflect.  It will reach a higher temperature and
<br>
thus a higher albedo, so it will reflect (rather than absorb) a higher
<br>
percentage of the incident photons than the more distant (and thus cooler)
<br>
interior surface.  These two factors, photon density and correlated albedo
<br>
values, should be the determining factors in the net thrust derived from
<br>
radiation pressure.  Higher albedo means higher reflection, and a reflected
<br>
photon delivers twice the thrust of an absorbed photon.  This thrust should
<br>
act as a restoring force driving the sphere back towards the concentric
<br>
position.  There being no particular reason for it to stop once it reaches
<br>
the concentric position, it would tend to overshoot, decelerate and then
<br>
reverse direction, oscillating in a back and forth manner.  This
<br>
oscillation, in two dimensions, and out of phase, would stabilize to a
<br>
condition where the sphere center describes an 'orbit' around the star. 
<br>
<p>The exterior of the sphere will likewise have an asymmetric radiation
<br>
emission pattern resulting in a net thrust.  A worst case scenario is that
<br>
the (waste) heat is transmitted through the shell locally and re-emitted
<br>
locally.  Clearly, it would be re-emitted--dumped--at a lower wavelength
<br>
resulting in a lower net thrust (I think I got that right) than that caused
<br>
by the radiation forces on the interior. The interior and exterior
<br>
radiation reaction forces appear to work in opposite directions, but since
<br>
the radiation incident on the interior surface is a restoring force and the
<br>
greater of the two, the net effect is a restoring force.
<br>
<p>One piece of this puzzle that goes beyond what I can handle is what is the
<br>
effect of the radiation in the interior of the sphere after it first
<br>
strikes the shell?  If it's absorbed I have no problem, but if it's
<br>
reflected and then absorbed, or bounces around for several generations
<br>
before finally being absorbed, what is the net effect?  I think first order
<br>
effects will dominate as described, but I'm prepared to hear other points
<br>
of view.
<br>
<p>Someone may say that radiation forces are puny in the inertial arena.  I
<br>
agree, but if they're the only forces in play, then they must dominate.
<br>
Response times are just very long.
<br>
<p>Candidate number two is something of a mystery to me.  I know it's there,
<br>
but I frankly don't know  how it acts on the system or how it compares in
<br>
magnitude of effect to radiation pressure.
<br>
<p>Magnetic field effects.
<br>
<p>The star may have a magnetic field.  The field lines may extend out into
<br>
space. How far out do they extend?  They may interact with the dyson
<br>
sphere.  They may be conducted through the dyson sphere.  What is the
<br>
sphere made of?  If it were made metallic and isotropic, would the star and
<br>
sphere be magnetically drawn together, or held stably concentric?  Could a
<br>
non-isotropic or non-metallic sphere design take advantage of or circumvent
<br>
magnetic effects to passively achieve spherical concentricity? 
<br>
<p>Help me.  I've fallen and I can't get up.
<br>
<p>One last note.  Though the 800 lb gorilla appears neutral in this matter,
<br>
that's only first order effects.  Second order gravitational effects may
<br>
come into play.  If the non-uniform heating of one side of the sphere
<br>
causes it to distort, or tidal forces cause it to distort, then
<br>
gravitational forces may again come into play.  The devil's in the details.
<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
