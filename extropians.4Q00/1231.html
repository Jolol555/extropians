<em>&gt; Nice review. I have a similar take on Paglia.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks.  It's a bit old -- from 1993; about one fourth of my life ago:) --
<br>
so my memory of her work is not that clear.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You mention Nietzsche and De
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sade. All three of them, to some extent, &quot;[Tear] apart every scene on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human stage...&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think they are really that thorough.  Any of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A method for finding truth, shared by the three writers mentioned above:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Attack every idea held by anyone, try to be random, offensive, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provocative, as much as possible (for attention, the joy of offense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction, revenge at society, or whatever). Use your intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literary prowess to its peak to defend even the most absurd hypothesis you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come up with by this method.
</em><br>
<p>While Paglia seems to do this, I think de Sade and Nietzsche had other
<br>
issues.  One the latter, he was concerned with the change in moralities from
<br>
the Homeric Greeks to the postSocratice and Christian world.  I think that
<br>
alone brings some sense to his work, though not all that much.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just as random genetic mutation results in an occassional brilliant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenotype, this method results in an occasional brilliant idea. But, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bulk of genetic mutations just result in disease, and the bulk of ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obtained by the above method are garbage (moreso for De Sade and Paglia
</em><br>
then
<br>
<em>&gt; Nietzsche, but he wrote his share of shit as well).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've never even tried to read a Paglia book, everything I know about her
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; from what I've read on the web.
</em><br>
<p>Your analogy is a good one.  I wouldn't say it's totally random, though.  I
<br>
think they both start with and end with their feelings.  They just happen to
<br>
be abnormal in respect to the content of their feelings.  Nietzsche and
<br>
Paglia both lack the ability to argue and reason -- or, at least, to do so
<br>
beyond arguing for or reasoning for their particular prejudices and quirks.
<br>
<p>Enjoy!
