<p><em>&gt; &gt;From _Science_: 1 Dec 2000:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sweden has new rules; persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be presumed dangerous until proven otherwise, and banned from use.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This rules will be applied to chemicals in use, not just old ones.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, this might have interesting effects on the sale of fat food ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seems pretty reasonable to me, actually.  But then I spent the day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning about milk-based paint and low-impact household cleansers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, white vinegar, lemon juice, salt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (abrasive)).
</em><br>
<p>When formulated as above, the precautionary principle isn't entirely
<br>
stupid. If something is persistent and tends to accumulate in living
<br>
tissue, then we better make sure it is safe. Past experiences with
<br>
pesticides show that this can be a very bad thing.
<br>
<p>What worries me is that the precautionary principle is being applied
<br>
indiscriminately, even when there is no or very weak reasons to think
<br>
that there is any risk. It is a favorite tool of the technocrats and
<br>
reactionaries/luddites, the former because it gives them the chance to
<br>
regulate things, the later because it is a simple, powerful way of
<br>
blocking anything new using the fear button (&quot;But you don't *know* if
<br>
GM food will have long term effects!&quot;). Also, by accepting it in one
<br>
area it can be more easily applied in other areas too (have you
<br>
checked that your new software doesn't cause ergonomic or social side
<br>
effects?).
