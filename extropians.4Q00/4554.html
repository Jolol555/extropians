<em>&gt;Uh oh -- I forgot one.  &quot;Contact&quot;.  It may actually be the only OTHER

<em>&gt;&quot;Science SF&quot; movie ever made, as well as a damned good &quot;Social SF&quot; movie. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The opening equence alone is worth the price of admission.  (And yes, I know

<p>The whole idea of where a society with backwards technology is able 
<br>
to replicate fantastically futuristic machines with only a blueprint, 
<br>
not even considering all of the manufacturing support needed, turns 
<br>
me way off.  It would be like sending a circa 600 AD earth society 
<br>
the plans for a Pentium IV.  I somehow doubt that they could figure 
<br>
out the lithography and how to create extraordinarily pure silicon.
<br>
<p>To further think that there would have been any doubt as to the alien 
<br>
origins of the machine after they had built it leaves me cold as 
<br>
well.  She stepped into the chamber, and metal pieces (like the door) 
<br>
morphed.  What, while building the chamber there were no testing 
<br>
phases where this occurred?  Oh, so maybe they built this fantastic 
<br>
machine without ever debugging any of it?  So after our circa 600 AD 
<br>
earth society successfully builds that Pentium IV system and plays 
<br>
Quake for a few minutes, everyone is going to say, &quot;Nothing special 
<br>
here.  must be a phony.&quot;
<br>
<p>There was a South Park where Mr. Garrison wanted to get a nose job. 
<br>
He was in the doctor's office, having the procedure described in 
<br>
graphic detail - the doctor said things like, &quot;Then we'll snap this 
<br>
piece of bone in your nose and cut away all the meaty cartilage we 
<br>
don't want.  There'll be a lot of blood.&quot;  Mr. Garrison listens 
<br>
without emotion, then the doctor says (something like), &quot;We could 
<br>
also give you a nose like Jodi Foster in Contact&quot;.  Garrison starts 
<br>
retching explosively, &quot;Oh, God!  Why did you mention that awful 
<br>
movie?  &lt;retch&gt; I sat through two hours of that crap and the alien 
<br>
was her father! &lt;retch&gt;&quot;
<br>
