</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since it's spontaneous, it obviously doesn't require any endorsement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's really at issue here is accurately identifying human social trends

</em><br>
<p>Once again you're being too literal.  I take the free market to be a
<br>
good example of spontaneous order, but it does need some advocacy: if
<br>
no one advocates getting out of its way and letting it work, it won't
<br>
happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; No, this misses the point that transhuman fascists, for example, are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in no way extropic, not even by virtue of the fact that they support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're talking about transhumanists who refer to themselves as &quot;fascists&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This boggles my bogosity meter. How can an admitted fascist (a usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; derogatory characterization) claim to support transhumanism? It seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me such an individual would experience a severe case of cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissonance, no? Or else the claim is just plain bogus.
</em><br>
<p>I take transhumanism to be a fairly sparse set of beliefs about
<br>
whether and how we should use future technology to improve our
<br>
welfare.  Being a fascist doesn't support or conflict with this view
<br>
at all.  Being a fascist merely means that you endorse strong
<br>
authoritarian political and economic policies, generally prioritizing
<br>
one's nation-race above the individual.  (Though Nick Bostrom raised
<br>
an important point about humanism that I'll reply to separately.)
<br>
<p>More to the point, while being a &quot;fascist&quot; is a term WE use
<br>
negatively, it used to be a popular political movement.  Many people
<br>
around the world throughout the 20th century have been proud to call
<br>
themselves fascists, and some still do today.  I take it that these
<br>
people *shouldn't* be proud of this, but there's no reason to expect
<br>
that they'd be self-hating or that *they'd* find any significant
<br>
negative connotations in their beliefs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If you must nitpick, I suppose they're more entropic than luddites,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but that's really not saying very much.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, not saying much at all, in light of how you've described their other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attributes. Fascistic luddites... sounds like a profile for self-hating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; losers.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;blink blink&gt; Yes, I *do* think that fascistic luddites are losers,
<br>
but there's no reason to think that they'd be self-hating.  Of course,
<br>
no luddite is a transhumanist, but that goes without saying.
<br>
<p>Maybe this will be clearer.  You can be a fascist transhumanist, or
<br>
you can be a fascist opposed to transhumanism, or you can be a
<br>
transhumanist opposed to fascism.
<br>
<p>You can be both.  You can be one or the other.  You can be neither.
<br>
<p>You can be a fascist luddite.  You can be a non-fascist luddite.  But
<br>
you can't be a luddite transhumanist.
<br>
<p>Got it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Transhumanism without a commitment to extropy is just transhumanism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This can turn into an extropic society, or it can turn out in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dystopic socialist nightmare.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, I think I'm getting it now. Evidently transhumanists can go backward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well as forward, they can revert to primordial primitivism and/or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress toward their socialist dystopian future. Either way, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation of them makes them seem irrelevant via their own imcompetence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unless of course they have some means for brainwashing a large population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and enslaving them to their twisted ideology. You didn't have that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario in mind, I trust.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know where you got this interpretation.  I said that *some*
<br>
transhumanists, on account of their opposal to extropy, are entropic,
<br>
would endorse entropic outcomes, etc.  I named fascist transhumanists
<br>
as an obvious example.  There's no prima facie reason to think that
<br>
these people would be incompetent at all.
<br>
<p>I never said that transhumans could &quot;revert to primordial
<br>
primitivism,&quot; unless by &quot;reversion to primitivism&quot; you mean &quot;could
<br>
turn to fascism,&quot; which is a stretch.  You seem to think that I said
<br>
that transhumanists could be luddites, which is quite silly.  (&quot;I hate
<br>
high tech, so I'm going to upload my consciousness!&quot;)
<br>
<p>However, I have every reason to think that a proud group of fascist
<br>
transhumanists could indeed bring about a high tech socialist
<br>
dystopia.  This says nothing about socialism generally, says nothing
<br>
about whether socialism must always be dystopic.  All I'm saying is
<br>
that a transhuman Nazi future would indeed be a nightmare.  (It
<br>
would also be socialist, but that's not my main point.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Consider, for example, the Nazis, &lt;dum dum dum, discussion ends&gt; many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of whom would self-identify as transhuman fascists.  In a possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nazi future, the Aryan technocratic elite would live forever, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rest of us would be enslaved or crushed.  But just because the Aryan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; elite would use High Tech to live forever doesn't mean that a Nazi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; future would be anything close to extropic.  And they'd hardly mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that.  As far as they're concerned, extropy is dumb.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Sigh) Now we've got these transhumans who are willing to identify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves not only as fascists, but also as nazis... So, how can they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect any rational beings to take them seriously?
</em><br>
<p>Beats me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Don't intelligent people know that socialism doesn't work because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fails to provide adequate incentives to produce the materials needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for prosperity? Don't enough folks understand that nationalism means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war? Doesn't the word fascist elicit negative reactions from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; educated people?
</em><br>
<p>Modern fascists seem to have rationalized their way around such
<br>
problems.  These people really are out there:
<br>
<p><a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/Cultures_and_Groups/White_Pride_and_Racialism/">http://dir.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/Cultures_and_Groups/White_Pride_and_Racialism/</a>
<br>
<p>Or just search on &quot;racialism.&quot;  It's the code word for &quot;politically
<br>
racist and proud of it.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I thought I had done my homework on this, Dan. Now it seems you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; informing me that transhumanists are somewhat lower on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary scale than scum-sucking trolls. Well, at least I never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; told anyone that I was a transhumanist.
</em><br>
<p>Again, this is just silly.  I'M a transhumanist.  But, you know, some
<br>
transhumanists believe bad things.  Fascist transhumanists believe bad
<br>
things.  That's all.
