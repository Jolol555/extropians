<p><em>&gt; Judging a community from the behavior of drunk young punks who that

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>When I was growing up in the 50s and 60s in the Bible Belt, earnest
<br>
young men, not hoodlums were freely given the notion that it was ok to
<br>
go &quot;roll a few gays&quot;.  Of course I grew up in Klan country which had
<br>
even more ominous habits.  When any of these people were caught in those
<br>
days that got little more than a slap on the wrist.  It is better now
<br>
but various crimes of intolerance and beating on the &quot;not us&quot; are
<br>
certainly not unknown or limited to &quot;drunk young punks&quot;.
