<p>This is a helllll of an idea, one that we almost hit on a few weeks ago.  There
<br>
was once a Green party position that GM is a good thing, since the necessary
<br>
amount of food crop could be grown on a lot less land, making more room
<br>
for animals, etc.  Of course we didnt have much GM tech in those days.
<br>
<p>Well, we could form the extro-green party.  I have nothing against trees
<br>
or whales.  The extro-greens could be that branch of the Green party
<br>
which believes that laws and governments should never ever be used to
<br>
promote any agenda.  Rather, our notions should be promoted by
<br>
economic forces, which means more high-tech GM crops, so less water
<br>
is needed and less equipment and less land, so it saves the farmer money
<br>
and makes more room for the PRECIOUS wild animals.  I imagine there
<br>
are a lotta honest Greens who are squicked by their party's turning
<br>
away from high tech solutions.  Great idea Zeb!  spike
