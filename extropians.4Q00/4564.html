<br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't understand how my article inspired those questions, but...
<br>
<p>Does mechanical engineering &quot;owe anything, as a discipline, to promote the
<br>
greater good?&quot;  I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but just to show that
<br>
philosophy can be considered just as mechanical engineering, as a discipline
<br>
or a body of knowledge.  In either case, people use them for good or ill.
<br>
<p>Philosophies vary a lot too.  One shouldn't assume that all of them are
<br>
equal or as useful or as valid.  In this vein, it's my belief that
<br>
philosophy's purpose, against which it can't be measured, is to help
<br>
individuals to live life.  So in a sense, it should be for the good, though
<br>
there is a lot of difference between different people and different
<br>
philosophical systems over what is good.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
