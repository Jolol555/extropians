Eugene Leitl clarifies,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course it's a autocatalytic and a positive autofeedback loop, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the growth function would clearly saturate without a substrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change. However long and hard I study, I won't be able to instantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factor 2 kBit integers in my head, or even leap tall buildings in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single bound.
</em><br>
<p>Right, so time matters when it comes to increasing intelligence.
<br>
Homo sapiens has increased intelligence over the millenia, but AI could do as
<br>
well or better over the course of minutes or seconds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sure we will change substrate (or create successors in the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrate and grow extinct) and the growth will continue, but it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require extremely clever timing to keep the growth function
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuously smooth.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I've noticed from reading about cleverness increase that humans tend to use
<br>
new knowledge to extend their power base. This is also known as war. Punctuated
<br>
equilibrium in the increase of human intelligence does not appear smooth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (If I see this happening, I'll start believing in weird shit like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairies, the best of all possible worlds, spacetime singularities as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers and the Omega point.
</em><br>
<p>If you start believing in such weirdness, some will say that confirms this is
<br>
the best of all possible worlds.
<br>
<em>&gt;blanch&lt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Sure Moravec claims the linear log plot is being linear despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repeatedly changed substrate, but I think his metric is rigged. We'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see where it goes in the next decades, perhaps I'll become acolyte of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Church of Singularity yet).
</em><br>
<p>Make sure it's the *First* Church of Singularity, because you know how those
<br>
denominational splits tend to dilute the true and authoritative word of Bob
<br>
Sing.
