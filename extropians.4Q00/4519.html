</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanism. Most criticsm against transhumanism is deep down about

</em><br>
<em>&gt;values.
</em><br>
<p>That's true (although who &quot;wins&quot; in a popular debate is often not closely 
<br>
related to how good arguments one can muster, but rather one's skill at 
<br>
pressing the right rhetorical buttons). More generally, there is a value to 
<br>
being able to analyze positions and break arguments down into smaller 
<br>
parts. Without this ability, disagreements often degenerate into idle 
<br>
posturing at a distance, each side feeling frustrated of the other's 
<br>
failure to see &quot;the obvious&quot;.
<br>
<p>I remember when I did my first logic course that it was initially quite 
<br>
perplexing to be asked to prove that 1+1=2. The proof could never be more 
<br>
obvious or convincing then the demonstrandum! Yet the discipline of trying 
<br>
to reduce such simple arithmetical statements to even more basic logical 
<br>
propositions led to the development of predicate logic, which has since 
<br>
produced a great many important and non-trivial results (e.g. Godel's 
<br>
theorem etc.).
<br>
<p>The lesson is that foundational work, even when it looks like pure academic 
<br>
game-playing, sometimes turns out to have been essential for progress later on.
<br>
<p>...which suggests that we should make more efforts to work out the 
<br>
foundations of our transhumanist outlook! And exactly what the problems are 
<br>
that need to be solved is usually not apparent until you actually begin to 
<br>
try to write a paper. I have a large number of aborted papers on various 
<br>
transhumanist topics rotting on my hard drive. Each started with the 
<br>
intention to write down some simple idea in a couple of pages, but in the 
<br>
process of doing so one is led to think more carefully about the subject 
<br>
and all sorts of complications arise. Still, I don't see these efforts as 
<br>
wasted.
