Sure, cogito ergo sum, little problem with that.
<br>

<br>
<em> &gt; Any rational individual must be aware of the fact that we live in place

</em><br>

</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Sure, but what has this to do with the issue at hand?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; Remember, WE are evidence for the existence of ET.  Unless you're able to
</em><br>
<p>That's not logical, captain. We have to exist to be able to realize
<br>
that we exist (anthropic principle). Our view is hence necessarily
<br>
biased, since we cannot contemplate the puzzle of our nonexistance in
<br>
lots of other places. In absence of other data points our existence is
<br>
evidence for our existence, and nothing beyond that. (Ok, I promise to
<br>
lay off bad acid for the future).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; show that the events that occurred on earth could not possibly be replicated
</em><br>
<em> &gt; elsewhere...?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Principia non sunt. Burden of proof. (=You lose).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; Asking questions like, &quot;Where are they?  Why can't we see them?&quot; is far more
</em><br>
<em> &gt; valuable than closing one's mind to the fact that &quot;intelligence happens.&quot;
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In absence of further data, the simplest explanation to Fermi's
<br>
paradoxon is that we're not in anybody smart/powerful light cone. I
<br>
would like to amplify that by stating that we would not be holding
<br>
this discussion if it was any different. Double anthropic principle.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; Can't we, Doug, at the very least, attach probabilties to the likelihood of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; intelligence spontaneously arising at other spatial coordinates in our
</em><br>
<em> &gt; existence matrix?
</em><br>
<p>Not in good faith, since our planetary accretion models nor our
<br>
steriliztion-catastrophe models nor our evolutionary kinetics models
<br>
are validated, and we don't have very-large-baseline interferometry
<br>
and very-large-aperture spectroscopy instruments to gather data points
<br>
on remote planet composition, size and orbit distribution/stability at
<br>
least in our stellar neighbourhood.
<br>
<p>We Need More Data.
