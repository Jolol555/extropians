<em>&gt; Yes, we do know better now.  Sure, the Romantics SEEMED to be continuing
</em><br>
on
<br>
<em>&gt; with the cultural impetus that began with the Enlightenment, but in fact
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; represented a turn down a blind alley of relativism and subjectivism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps the standard academic post-modernist canon taught in the liberal
</em><br>
arts
<br>
<em>&gt; establishment makes it seem like the progression from the rationalism of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; Enlightenment to the subjectivism of Romanticism was some kind of
</em><br>
inevitable
<br>
<em>&gt; historical necessity, but it wasn't.  Sure the young Byron and the young
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shelley cut a fine figure tossed by their emotional winds, but their
</em><br>
passions
<br>
<em>&gt; lead historically to the confused subjectivist dogmas of the 20th century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and, also as a matter of historical fact, to the passions of such
</em><br>
political
<br>
<em>&gt; dogmas as modern nationalism and the intellectual glorification of violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social revolution.
</em><br>
<p>Ah yes, but without that impulse towards revolution, where would we be?
<br>
(This is where I begin to scream that I'm not a robot.  All present, please
<br>
plug your ears.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the 50s &quot;cool&quot; people read Meade and Marcuse and Marx and could feel
</em><br>
good
<br>
<em>&gt; about maintaining their ideological progressiveness in the face of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conformity of &quot;the man in the gray flannel suit&quot;; today people in the know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read Dawkins and More and Kurzweil and look forward to a REAL revolution,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while the mainstream of academia slowly dissolves in a self-congratulatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; puddle of subjectivist nonsense.
</em><br>
<p>Subjectivism isn't nonsense- the entire discipline of hermeneutics depends
<br>
on this concept.  Although I agree that post-modernism is a dead paradigm
<br>
that hasn't had it's funeral yet, I can't agree with a paradigm which denies
<br>
the relevance of my existence.  Not that the ideological progressives of the
<br>
1950's were any better (Karl Marx?  Communist Materialism?!?)... I'll agree
<br>
that Romanticism is lousy as a base from which to work, or a social
<br>
paradigm, but it's a wonderful way to live one's life.  In my opinion, the
<br>
best philosophy isn't that which achieves the most universal happiness, but
<br>
the one that tells the best story in the end.  Wars, revolutions, love,
<br>
hate, death- this is what makes life interesting!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  Well then, zeig heil!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wonder what this could mean.
</em><br>
<p>Extrobots seldom seem to grasp the concept of &quot;meaning&quot;.
