<p>Some people provide a net benefit to the rest of society only in their absence

from it. Some people are irretreivably lost while still quite alive. Some people

need killin'

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A sentient, caring person can come to appreciate the enormity of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrongness of the act if properly reformed and never perform such an act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again.  Many acts short of murder but also quite heinous cannot be

<em>&gt; undone.  At best one can make what poor atonement one can and resolve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never to perform in such a way again.  Or do you believe all wrong-doers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be executed given your logic?
</em><br>
<p>Not all wrong doers, but the cost to incarcerate an incorrigible murderer for
<br>
life is so great you might as well just offer a $3 million dollar reward for
<br>
people to turn themselves in. You'd save more money that way. Society practices
<br>
the morals it can afford. I can't afford YOUR morals, which seem intent on
<br>
rewarding murderers with lifetime maximum security bed and breakfast services,
<br>
nor can society. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can a sentient, caring person condemn another human being to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irreversible and irretrievable death?
</em><br>
<p>Thats just it: murderers are not sentient caring people (not manslaughterers,
<br>
etc), else they would not murder people. They typically do not recognise others
<br>
as 'real', or at least as 'real' or important as themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This could also lead to a dilemma: What if someone decided to kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone knowing the worst that could happen is that the &quot;bad part&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would be purged. They would still accomplish their task.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not that simple by far.  There is no &quot;bad part&quot;.  This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strawman.  Their task was a misaligned way of acheiving some goal.  Cure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the misalignment if you can.
</em><br>
<p>And who do you suggest decide how the fixing gets done and by whome? By
<br>
governments that kill far more people than individuals do? By doctors who kill
<br>
more people from negligence every year than are murdered intentionally? Show me
<br>
someone who knows what the hell they are doing first. Until you get such people
<br>
can do that job, those that offend should be excised from society. Life is not
<br>
the highest ethic, liberty is at least coequal to it. 'Death is not the worst of
<br>
evils'.  What is wrong about murder is not the theft of life, but of liberty,
<br>
life being merely one of many liberties the individual posesses, and the one
<br>
without which the rest are moot. One who commits such an act surrenders their
<br>
own right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Of course one would like to think if we had the kind of technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that could remove &quot;the bad part&quot; this would be accomplished before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the fact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most likely many such murders would be avoided by better psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and sociological practices before the fact.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt it very much. Better education, more stable upbringing, these would make
<br>
a difference for most. The rest, those who are 'wired wrong', if you can't
<br>
rewire them, eliminating them from the gene pool is the best you can do.
