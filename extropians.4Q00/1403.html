<p><em> &gt; &lt;&gt; Suppose someone actually uses the ISS for one of the primary original 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; purposes envisioned in the Original Plan, i.e. as a construction and 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; maintenance base for further space infrastructure, such as a reusable 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; translunar vehicle, planetary transit vehicles and the like.  How much 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; penalty is imposed by its current orbit?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Excuse me, I don't see any logics behind this. All the mass must come
<br>
from the bottom of some nearby gravitational well. There is nothing
<br>
else there nearby which doesn't have a prohibitive delta vee. If one
<br>
thinks about braking down some near earth asteroids with a barrage of
<br>
nukes sufficient for Earth orbit capture, lowering down asteroid belt
<br>
material with solar sails or braking a comet fragment using newly
<br>
proposed plasma magnetic solar wind sail these are obviously highly
<br>
complex, very expensive missions. Being realistic, we cannot think of
<br>
those yet.
<br>
<p>If you want to refuel using Earth resources, you need to haul up fuel
<br>
using some cheap transportation, hypersonic reusable vehicle (to be
<br>
developed, a risky investment) or old-fashioned rockets (proven,
<br>
scalable technology, would be much cheaper if built in numbers). It
<br>
would be much better to use lunar linear mass drivers for launching
<br>
processed materials and probes, so constructing these should be on top
<br>
of our priorities.
<br>
<p>We can get to the Moon in one piece from Earth surface. Why using
<br>
several missions to bring up fuel and system modules before going to
<br>
the Moon? It would rather make more sense to build a bigger rocket,
<br>
something which can carry twice Proton's payload.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; &lt;&gt;  Would it be possible to actually use the ISS as a &quot;construction base&quot; for 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; projects such as assembling translunar or interplanetary vehicles?  This 
</em><br>
<p>The trend goes to smaller system size. It is not obvious why even a
<br>
deep space mission would profit from more bulk, unless we're talking
<br>
manned missions. But manned missions are an obvious mistake at this
<br>
point, anyway.
