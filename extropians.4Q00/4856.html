Actually, before I even posted my message I thought &quot;1) I hope Doug Jones 
<br>
pipes up (pun intended) - maybe he'll give us more details about XCOR's 
<br>
ultimate plans and 2) saying 'go nanotech!' will probably make me look like a 
<br>
passive singulatarian.&quot;  So, some clarifications and responses.
<br>
<p>On the latter item, my point was to say that advancing material and 
<br>
manufacturing science WILL inevitably lower the threshold for building 
<br>
machines complex, capable and reliable enough to get  to orbit.  Ultimately, 
<br>
it will get cheap and easy enough that relatively small groups with modest 
<br>
financing CAN do it with reasonable business models.  Where the two lines 
<br>
cross is anybody's guess at this point, but it's probably somewhere short of 
<br>
full-blown Drextech.  (For example, consider the debacle with the fuel tank 
<br>
on the Venture Star - or whatever they're calling it now - relatively 
<br>
straightforward advances in composite materials technology will make a big 
<br>
difference.)
<br>
<p>Obviously getting the business model and organization right is just as 
<br>
crucial as getting the engineering right.  Doug's forward of Jeff Greason's 
<br>
post seems right on in that respect and bears repeating:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My current opinion, after watching and participating in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  1990's era of space start-ups, is that there is a very fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  reason why sophisticated investors greatly prefer step-by-step
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  financing of companies.  If you give a large chunk of money to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a new company with a new team, you won't achieve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  desired result.  Building a company is a multi-step process, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you have to develop the engineering team, the business model,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the market, etc. as you go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If a start-up gets too much money too soon, it tries to skip
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  engineering steps (to achieve too-short promised schedules),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and jump right into the biggest markets (with higher costs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  enter the market).  The odds of hitting multiple home runs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (on technology, targeting the right market, etc.) with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  first time at bat for a new team, are very low.
</em><br>
<p>On the other hand, as I think about what kind of intermediate steps might 
<br>
make sense, I wonder whether they can represent meaningful economic way 
<br>
stations on the path to a truly revolutionary approach to the business of 
<br>
getting into space.  The most obvious intermediate step seems to be 
<br>
propulsion which, as far as I can tell from what's publicly available from 
<br>
XCOR's web site, seems to be the approach it is taking.  But aren't there 
<br>
already plenty of rocket engine manufacturers, especially with the Russians 
<br>
now in the global market?  Unless you've developed some significant 
<br>
improvements in manufacturing and/or operating efficiencies, have you really 
<br>
gotten any closer to building a truly new avenue to orbit?

<p><em>&gt; I don't know if you're aware of a company called SpaceDev (SPDV.OB).
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I am; and I think their business model represents one with quite a 
<br>
bit of promise.  Instead of working from &quot;the ground up&quot;, SpaceDev is 
<br>
developing products and services for sale IN SPACE on a seemingly quite 
<br>
reasonable schedule.  In fact, SpaceDev looks like the beginnings of a 
<br>
business model I've imagined for a long time, which would have as a major 
<br>
intermediate milestone the establishment of an on-orbit servicing facility, 
<br>
with a reusable, robotic &quot;tug&quot; as the cornerstone of a private space 
<br>
infrastructure system.  Such a business model could, it seems, be extended 
<br>
&quot;downward&quot; in steps: Building an aeroshell for delivery of payloads FROM 
<br>
orbit would be a next step.  Making it reusable would be a next step on the 
<br>
way to building a spaceplane upper stage.  The techniques employed in 
<br>
building the X-38 ACRV would be a sweet model for such a system.
