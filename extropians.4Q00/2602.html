Subject: Spun nanotubes spell breakthrough
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PARIS, Nov 16 (AFP) - French researchers reported Thursday they  
<br>
had achieved a breakthrough in making carbon nanotubes, one of the 
<br>
most exciting inventions of the past decade, which could open the 
<br>
way to manufacturing them as fibres with a host of uses. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanotubes, first invented in 1991, are tubes with a diameter far  
<br>
smaller than a human hair, with a carbon structure that makes them 
<br>
chemically inert but light, extremely strong and resilient, as well 
<br>
as able to conduct heat and electricity. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are conventionally created by vaporising graphite rods by  
<br>
electric arc in a chamber filled with a gas such as helium or 
<br>
hydrogen, and then allowed to cool slowly. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists from the Paul Pascal Research Centre at the  
<br>
University of Bordeaux said they had devised a method to spin 
<br>
single-wall nanotubes into &quot;indefinitely long&quot; ribbons and fibres. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike other carbon fibres, they are extremely flexible and can  
<br>
even be knotted without breaking, they reported. Their research is 
<br>
published in full in Friday's issue of Science, the US weekly 
<br>
journal. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultra-strong fibres of this kind have a wide variety of  
<br>
potential applications, from artificial muscles to hydrogen storage 
<br>
and flat-screen TVs, the researchers hope. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ribbons were created by dispersing raw nanotube soot into a  
<br>
surfactant, or detergent, solution. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That solution was then injected into a flowing steam of polymer  
<br>
solution which caused the nanotube material to recondense into a 
<br>
mesh. The flow of the solution aligned the mesh into ribbon-like 
<br>
fibres. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 2, separate teams from Japan's NEC Corp. and the  
<br>
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology reported they had 
<br>
created the smallest nanotubes feasible, each narrower than a 
<br>
filament of DNA. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tubes were just 0.4 nanometres (0.4 billionths of a metre)  
<br>
wide. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists have previous created even smaller tubes, of 0.33  
<br>
nanometres. However, these are unstable because structural changes 
<br>
at this tiny scale can force carbon to become metallic. 
<br>
