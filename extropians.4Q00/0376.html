<p>Interesting observation.  Having grown up with firearms and having had early 
<br>
formal training in gun safety at my dad's insistence, I had an experience 
<br>
bearing on this a few years ago.  Playing paintball with some friends, I had 
<br>
gotten myself positioned as a &quot;forward scout&quot; protecting our flag-theft team 
<br>
from a well camoflaged position near the main route to the Bad Guy's goal.  
<br>
We had infiltrated through the Bad Guy's flag-guards without detection.  I 
<br>
suddenly saw the opposing player who would be the one to detect our 
<br>
infiltration team's return from grabbing the flag.  He didn't see me and I 
<br>
had a clear shot at him through the heavy East Texas brush.  I drew a bead on 
<br>
him but, for a moment had the oddest sensation of deep safeguards within my 
<br>
mind kicking in: &quot;Don't Point Guns at People.  Don't Shoot People&quot; a strong, 
<br>
clear voice from my childhood spoke in my head.  I had to consciously tell 
<br>
myself that the weapon in my hand wasn't a &quot;real&quot; gun before I could pull the 
<br>
trigger.
<br>
<p>I'd played paintball before and hadn't had this experience.  The difference 
<br>
was the &quot;cold blooded&quot; nature of the shot I was about to take.  In the &quot;heat 
<br>
of battle&quot; it had never been difficult to shoot a paintball at someone . . . .
