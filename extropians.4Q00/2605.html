<p>
Hal,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for this information about the new vitrification
<br>
technique being offered by Alcor.  (I'm in the process of signing up
<br>
but haven't completed it yet.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (The reason I am a whole body member is because I believe there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information in the muscles, spinal cord and other tissues which will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be recoverable in a cloned body.  This includes both learned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information as well as basic issues of neural architecture which are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not fully determined by genetics.  Fitting an old head to a new body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may not be practical, I fear.)
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My beliefs are different.  I think (or at least hope) all
<br>
information will eventually be recoverable.  I just think if a body is
<br>
provided, some of the information will be easer to recover and hence
<br>
be recovered sooner.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My primary reason for wanting a full body is the extra level
<br>
of security.  If funds run low, they can always chuck the body and
<br>
save only the head.  But if you've only provided funds for a neural,
<br>
there is nothing lessor to back up to in case of an emergency.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about both?  Would this be possible?  Primarily do the
<br>
neural with the new technique, but preserve the rest of the body as
<br>
best as they can?  Putting them both in the dewer together (of course
<br>
the head still on the bottom)?  Then if there is some kind of
<br>
emergency requiring it, they can all the easer chuck the body and save
<br>
the separated head?  Does anyone know if Alcor could provide such an
<br>
option?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brent
