Extropes,
<br>
<p>Gene offered an extensive response to my post, and I wish to express my
<br>
appreciation.  He wrote: (double indents &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; are me, single indents &quot;&gt;&quot;
<br>
are gene)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The predicted instability of the solid version of the dyson sphere has
</em><br>
been
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a source of disappointment for moi ever since I heard about it.  The idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;While the idea of man-made celestial crystal sphere is rather neat, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do not see any essential features not covered by a cloud of orbiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;objects, which can be made even optically dense. It would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interesting to see how we can use this to intercept the majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the solar wind, too. Implanting them into periodically recycled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sacrificial layers; using magnetic field traps?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So, whence the disappointment?
</em><br>
<p>My preference for the solid shell comes from the comparative simplicity of
<br>
that structure compared to the layer upon layer of orbiting rings of
<br>
satellites built up until they finally and fully shroud the central star.
<br>
The problematic stability of the solid shell is, in the latter case,
<br>
replaced by the (seemingly daunting--I confess, this is a function of my
<br>
mental laziness--) task of maintaining the cloud's vast multitude in
<br>
orderly lockstep. While I acknowledge the feasibility of the Dyson &quot;cloud&quot;
<br>
approach (the accepted teminology is as gene noted, &quot;shell&quot; for the solid
<br>
sphere, and &quot;sphere&quot; for the orbital cloud), my aged neural mitochondria
<br>
plead exhaustion in prospect of the required analysis, and retire from the
<br>
field of battle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; of the fully enclosed star was so delightful to me, and so elegant, that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pondered long over the matter seeking some remedy, some bit of phenomenon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to rescue me from my despair.  I considered the predicted instability, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; concluded that it was factually supported, but based on +considerations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gravity and gravity alone.  Gravity, to the exclusion of all other forces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the universe, as if no other forces existed.  Fortuitously, this is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the case.  Also fortuitously, the gravitational 'instability' is neutral.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That is, gravity does not actively drive the system to collapse, but
</em><br>
rather
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stands by, having no effect at all.  This is in contrast to orbital
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hmm. Even if you could construct it, what about self gravitation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(collapse is autocatalytic), and tidal forces? 
</em><br>
<p>I ran the risk of being misunderstood when I said that gravity &quot;stands by,
<br>
having no effect at all.&quot;  I needed the reader to understand the
<br>
gravitational dynamics at work in the solid-shell-encloses-central-star
<br>
configuration. 
<br>
<p>So, you are correct.  The challenges of construction and the maintenance of
<br>
structural integrity against collapse--due to the combined gravitaional
<br>
contributions of both the star and the shell--are fundamental, crucial,
<br>
non-trivial considerations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, the thing as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whole is in orbit (since static sphere can only be too gossamer to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of much use), so the equator will be doing allright, but you're in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deep shit as soon as you start deviating from the equatorial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;orbits.
</em><br>
<p>Spinning the shell--in contrast to a static shell--is a standard
<br>
assumption.  Centrifugal 'force' counters gravitational force; most
<br>
perfectly at the 'equator', less so as you deviate from the equitorial
<br>
plane.  I'm not yet willing to characterized the non-equitorial
<br>
circumstance as &quot;deep shit&quot;, nor the static shell as &quot;gossamer&quot;.  In the
<br>
former case the vectors, aided by the commendable structural
<br>
characteristics of the spherical shape seem quite promising, though
<br>
admittedly I'm still working the math looking for support.  (Others have
<br>
said that they've done the math, and that the prognosis is bad.  Ok.  Call
<br>
me an untrusting fellow, but I'd just like to work it out for myself.  I'm
<br>
sure you know how that is.) 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Orbital cloud solves this by changing height and inclination
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the orbit, so stuff never collides (this won't work if the orbiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stuff is dumb and has no control over own orbit).  With the cloud, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have only the fragmentation catastrophe, and you can lick that with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;active orbit control.
</em><br>
<p>Orbital cloud good. Yes.  Active control required, yes, agreed.  The shell
<br>
too, even best case, will, I suspect, need active control.  If the magnetic
<br>
field of the star makes it like a giant magnet, then, like a small magnet
<br>
in a metal box, what's it gonna do but seek to glom onto the side?  Can't
<br>
have that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Radiation pressure, baby.  It ain't big, but it's real.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If your orbit has no radial component (wheee!), you can't held
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anything relevant afloat, even if the floating stuff is heated to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;white incandescence. Do the math. Magnetic plasma sails do much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better, but you can't operate another one within few 10 km radius.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not entirely clear on what you mean here.  But guessing that you're
<br>
referring to resistance to gravitational collapse, I repeat that I'm
<br>
holding off on a conclusion about the &quot;gossamer&quot; nature of the shell.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Solar radiation on the interior of the sphere will tend to drive the
</em><br>
sphere
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so that the center of the sphere describes an 'orbit' around the star.  To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see why this is so, consider what happens if the star is off-center.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; portion of the sphere nearest the star has the greater density of incident
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; photons to both absorb and reflect.  It will reach a higher temperature
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thus a higher albedo, so it will reflect (rather than absorb) a higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; percentage of the incident photons than the more distant (and thus cooler)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interior surface.  These two factors, photon density and correlated albedo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; values, should be the determining factors in the net thrust derived from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; radiation pressure.  Higher albedo means higher reflection, and a
</em><br>
reflected
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; photon delivers twice the thrust of an absorbed photon.  This thrust
</em><br>
should
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; act as a restoring force driving the sphere back towards the concentric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; position.  There being no particular reason for it to stop once it reaches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the concentric position, it would tend to overshoot, decelerate and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reverse direction, oscillating in a back and forth manner.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; oscillation, in two dimensions, and out of phase, would stabilize to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; condition where the sphere center describes an 'orbit' around the star. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Have you considered that you're heating the star up, by reflecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bulk of radiation back in in form of shortwave photons? (Instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;making the orbiting objects as black as possible). Whatever the star
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is going to do, this is not going to be sustainable. You're going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heat the star, which will bloat and emit bluer and bluer. You'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely can boost mass loss that way, by making the surface hotter.
</em><br>
<p>Ahh, this is the part I liked.  This is something I had not considered.
<br>
This is a major point. Unlike the current situation, where the earth
<br>
intercepts a trivial amount of the sunlight and reradiation is beyond
<br>
trivial, the solid sphere contains one hundred percent of the energy.  At
<br>
equilibrium, conservation considerations require that the outer surface
<br>
must re-emit that full one hundred percent.  If the radius of the sphere is
<br>
one AU--the radius of the sphere is an unstated variable in all these
<br>
discussions; it could be anywhere from just above the solar corona
<br>
to,...?--then the solar radiation intensity is ~1300 watts per meter^2.  So
<br>
1300 w/m^2 in means 1300 w/m^2 out.  As you say, the interior is going to
<br>
heat up.  The exact dynamics of the situation is uncertain (to me anyway).
<br>
How much the star will heat up seems at least partly contingent on the size
<br>
of the shell (thus my comment on the oft unspecified nature of that
<br>
variable).  How hot the shell and the star get will affect the thermal
<br>
characteristics and dynamics of the entire affair.  So, returning to the
<br>
original reasons for considering this vast project in the first
<br>
place--beyond the thrill of hubris and transhuman ambition-- we need to
<br>
know something about the design details of the shell with respect to the
<br>
critical energy harvesting, transport, and reemission.  I must leave that
<br>
to others.  So say my tired old mitochondria. 
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The exterior of the sphere will likewise have an asymmetric radiation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; emission pattern resulting in a net thrust.  A worst case scenario is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why assymetric? 
</em><br>
<p>If the star is off center relative to the shell, such as when thay are in
<br>
constant motion relative to one another, then the interior of the shell is
<br>
hottest nearest the star. Assuming passive, or locally proportionate heat
<br>
transmission, the exterior of the shell will also be correspondingly
<br>
hotter.  Thus the greater, ie assymetric, exterior emission centered about
<br>
that point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A fraction of the photons get absorbed, and is heating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the envelope. The asymmetric thing is more interesting if you can make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the cloud radiate anisotropically,
</em><br>
<p>Just to keep things straight, I note that you appear to be applying the
<br>
discussion of radiation pressure issues to the dyson sphere/cloud case here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;predominantly in one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;direction. However, this impacts recoil upon the cloud, shifting it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;orbit. Will you cancel out the impulse impacted upon the residual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system (minus the radiated photons), if you use photonic pressure to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;readjust the disturbed cloud component orbits? I have no idea. Someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;please tell me, as it is rather significant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snipped section of my original post, which gene didn't comment on&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The devil is in the details.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The devil is that you can't build a sphere of any relevant size
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without infinitely strong material (Unobtainium still isn't in the PSE
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last time I looked). 
</em><br>
<p>I acknowledge that others have run the numbers and claim that the strengths
<br>
of available materials are not up to the task of constructing a stable
<br>
dyson shell.  On that basis I provisionally concede its infeasability.
<br>
Nevertheless, I'll want to run those numbers myself, to see if I come up
<br>
with the same answer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Denser objects are sufficiently small, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they're typically fierce and have literally astronomic gravitation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gradients. You might construct you classical Dyson sphere around a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very small singularity (a primeordial relict or a newly minted),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though. If it has something like a few g/s mass loss as Hawking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;radiation, and has the right wavelength (I'm rather not warm my toes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;directly on a hard xRay source), you could build your sphere around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it. Even fill the sphere envelope with some gas/dust, so that you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;homeostate the hole in the right regime by feeding just as much as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evaporates, and attenuate the hard radiation from the eye of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dragon (hole and accretion disk). The whole thing doesn't have to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more than a few Gt mass, probably, and would be rather cold on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surface. Invisible unless there are lots of them, or you look at one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from real close. And rather efficient, of course.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks again, to gene, for the substantial effort and quality of his
<br>
response.  And thanks as well to Adrian, Mike, Eliezer, John, Sterling,
<br>
Emlyn, and Damien.
<br>
<p>And best wishes to all in this holiday season.
