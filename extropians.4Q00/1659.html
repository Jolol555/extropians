</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
You said it yourself; bayonets exist because battlefields, unlike hunting trips, sometimes involve close combat.  It's not much of a modification to take it off; much more costly modifications are commonly implemented to circumvent laws, or to attract criminals, such as 'fingerproof' surface.  What's the legitimate use for that featiure, huh?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If we applied your reasoning to everything, you'd lose most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things you own, and everything that remained would have far fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;features.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Prove it.  Such unsupportable assumptions obviate what worth might possibly be found in your contentions.  What would it cost my heating and air conditionong, my car, my house, my sound system, my television, etc., to have all their nonexistent 'military' features removed?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Flash suppressors
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; don't do anything that has any applicability to criminal use (if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; you think it does, you don't know what a flash suppressor is for)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; and falls under the same category as barrel shrouds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; They're great for hiding the source location of snipers, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; at night.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You had to do it...&lt;sigh&gt;.  A flash suppressor does *not* (repeat:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does *not*) have any use for hiding snipers.  In fact, real snipers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intentionally do not use flash suppressors because it actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increases the muzzle signature (yes, really). But then, if you knew
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what you were talking about you wouldn't have mentioned it. Remember,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the real world isn't like the movies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Why are they vcalled flash *suppressors*, then, instead of flash liberators?  Are suppressed flashes brighter in your Orwellian terminology?  What purpose could flash suppressors that do not suppress flashes possibly serve?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So you don't want the herd to know where you're picking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; them off from?  It's not a (game) hunting attachment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Some people don't seem to use their brain much either.  Should we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demand that they get a lobotomy?  Sure they seem harmless now, but a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fool is just *begging* for trouble.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
No, they can keep their brains; they obviously need all they've got, and more.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Folding/collapsible stocks are good for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; paratroopers and small statured people that can't use a rifle that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; has a regular stock because of length-of-pull issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; That's a reasonable civilian use, but a short stock will do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; same.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Congratulations, you shit on your own argument.  The NFA that you love
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so much forbids shortened stocks, as it makes rifles &quot;too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concealable&quot;. The only &quot;out&quot; in this was collapsible/folding stocks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thanks to the '94 gun control legislation, these are now also banned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I know a great number of Asian women who *require* collapsible stocks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to use a rifle, as any NFA legal stock has a length of pull that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;too long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As I said, &quot;well-intentioned but poorly educated&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I'm not opposed to collapsible stocks, either; handguns are much more concealable than any collapsed-stock rifle.  My main gripe is with the semiauto capability, especially when it can be easily kitted to full auto.  Either short or collapsible will do, and I'm quite sure that the great many tiny Asian women you personally know (and they are not ALL small) are blessed by your acquaintanceship.
