<p>Just so you feel ok John, the official car of the SIAI is a very safe and
<br>
heavy 2000 model year BMW X5 SUV with 4.4L V8 in case we need to ever make
<br>
a quick getaway. Complete with license plate that says &quot;UPLOAD&quot; just in
<br>
case we have a Singularity before the one we plan :-)
<br>
<p>P.S. He-who-must-be-protected also rides only in the rear passenger seats
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generally. Zero possibility of head-to-windshield contact :-)
