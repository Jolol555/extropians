In reality being a minor is a real pain in the butt unless you are into
<br>
malls and your parents credit cards and consumer gratification!
<br>
<p>My mother used to go through me mail and even when I was an adult when she
<br>
was visiting my house used to go through my office and bedroom. And, she did
<br>
not miss much -- even asked what the hooks in the bedroom ceiling were for
<br>
--as if she could not guess. I finally just gave up and left everything out. 
<br>
<p>Best Ralph

<em>&gt;No.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I remember being a bit nervous about that, since my family was Orthodox Jewish

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You're a bit out of touch with Mom Logic, aren't you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But that's not the real reason - keeping &quot;atheism&quot; out of the subject lines
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be a major and unusual inconvenience and it really would border on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Family Correctness, like trying to keep message bodies clean.  Keeping the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subject lines PG-13 is just ordinary netiquette, if you ask me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; And also: a MAJor faux pas HERE:  there's nothing pornographic about Gayness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Or having sex to stay young.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of course there isn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If we put something like &quot;Teen Fuck Blowjobs&quot; - sure, OK, I'd agree -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; otherwise, if you are grown up enough to handle the topics here you can also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be a grown up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and deal with  it in the subject line
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of course you can...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; - and be honest with your parents if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; they are looking over your shoulder
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
