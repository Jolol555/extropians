<p>Except for the fact that algore might be reinventing himself in the race
<br>
for the center, the strategy that makes the most sense, in order to get
<br>
elected.  Once elected, algore v.7.1 may re-emerge, the one that

wrote &quot;Earth in the Balance.&quot;

<p><em>&gt; &gt; Libertarian to do is to vote Republican and donate to Darth

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're also missing the fact that it's morally reprehensible to support your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemies.
</em><br>
<p>Wellll, I would not go as far as &quot;morally reprehensible&quot;, especially when
<br>
you are helping your harmless enemy so he can harm your harmful
<br>
other enemy.  I admit, it gets hopelessly entangled in paradox.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If every Libertarian did as you suggest, the Greens would get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge boost and the LP would be seriously set back.
</em><br>
<p>But what if the Greens did the same math?  Would they not help
<br>
Harry n order to harm Shrub?  And since there are (I think) more
<br>
Greens than Libertarians, then the LP wins on the deal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The best way to support the LP is to support the LP. Vote LP. Donate to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LP and the LP candidates. Don't play games trying to maximize your impact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that could backfire.  -Dave

<p>You may be right Dave.  Other views?  spike
