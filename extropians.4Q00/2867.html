Bored, probably not original, but oh well, late as
<br>
night, seems like good entertainment for me to watch
<br>
it get eaten alive:
<br>
1. The law of noncontradiction states that there must
<br>
be no contradictions because a contradiction implies
<br>
everything, and we do not perceive everything to be
<br>
the case.
<br>
2. Amidst that implied everything would necessarily be
<br>
an implied
<br>
mind-which-does-not-perceive-everything-to-be-the-case.
<br>
3. This indicates that the LNC is indeterminable.
<br>
4. Which means that there could exist possible worlds
<br>
where it doesn't operate without everything being
<br>
apparently the case.  
<br>
5. But it also means that within that field of things
<br>
which have been infinitely implied, there must exist
<br>
some statement, &quot;The LNC is universal and tautologous&quot;
<br>
which is necessarily correct.
<br>
6. But that would be a contradiction, because for it
<br>
to come about, there must exist some area of
<br>
nonuniversality where the LNC is not a tautology.
<br>
7. Which wouldn't matter in the case of it not
<br>
mattering- but would imply that the contradiction
<br>
existed through every possible world.
<br>
8. Further, as far as I can tell, there's no possible
<br>
way to tell the difference between a reality which is
<br>
reasonable and logical and self contained/consistent
<br>
constructed as a necessity within an infinite scope of
<br>
variety, and a world that exists because it is
<br>
reasonable and self-consistent and follows the rules
<br>
of formal reasoning.
