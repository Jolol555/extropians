Researchers Say They've Cloned Bull
<br>
ASSOCIATED PRESS
<br>
COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Researchers at Texas A&amp;M University say they 
<br>
have cloned a disease-resistant bull.
<br>
After testing hundreds of cattle since the 1970s, scientists at A&amp;M found a 
<br>
bull that was naturally resistant to brucellosis, which in cattle causes 
<br>
abortions, lessens fertility and reduces milk production. The bull also was 
<br>
found to be resistant to tuberculosis and salmonellosis, a bacterial 
<br>
infection that can also kill cattle.
<br>
The bull died of natural causes three years ago, but DNA material from it 
<br>
was used to create the cloned calf, which is about a month old, said Diane 
<br>
Oswald, a spokeswoman for A&amp;M's College of Veterinary Medicine.
<br>
A&amp;M scientists planned to unveil the calf and discuss their findings at a 
<br>
news conference Monday.
<br>
Although the diseases are mostly under control in the United States, they 
<br>
are still found in cattle around the world and could find their way back 
<br>
into domestic herds.
<br>
One of the project's researchers, Mark Westhusin, is involved in a $2.3 
<br>
million effort to clone a dog for the first time.
<br>
This is not the first time researchers at Texas A&amp;M have cloned a bull. In 
<br>
1999, scientists unveiled a cloned calf named Second Chance, whose DNA came 
<br>
from skin cells from a 21-year-old steer named Chance.
