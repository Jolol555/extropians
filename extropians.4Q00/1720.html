<p>In my research for Non-Lethal Technologies, I have run across references to 
<br>
US research in  electromagnetic antipersonnel weapons. One system, 
<br>
supposedly deployed during the Gulf War, is a black pyramidal device that 
<br>
is dropped in a grid pattern from helicopters. When activated, it radiates 
<br>
RF with a specific pulse shape that disrupts the nervous system, causing 
<br>
unconsciousness and death, if the victim is left in the field long enough, 
<br>
or is close enough to the emitter. The method of deployment seems only good 
<br>
for interdiction - like a mine field.
<br>
<p>The person who told me about this has a relative in the military who is 
<br>
into weapons research - so either I have heard a real leak or someone is 
<br>
telling a joke to see how far it spreads...
<br>
<p>We had inquiries from Department of Defense people as to what kind of 
<br>
waveforms our car stopper devices produced. When we told then that we make 
<br>
a damped sinusoid at around 1 MHz, they lost interest.
<br>
<p>I wonder if NMR techniques, perhaps focusing on a resonance in a molecule 
<br>
like hemoglobin, could be used as a death ray?  Perhaps all that is needed 
<br>
is a way of inducing a current in the victim that mimics the effects of a 
<br>
defibrillator.
<br>
<p>Ever read Heinlein's &quot;Sixth Column&quot;?
