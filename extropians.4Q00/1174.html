<p>Does spina bifida cause reduced body weight (yes, I could look this
<br>
and everything else up but I'm lazy)?
<br>
<p>Eris help me, this actually makes sense to me. Really, this would apply
<br>
to many different types of disabilities. Microgravity could be the next
<br>
great equalizer. The 'net already is. Is there an untapped extropic
<br>
reserve among the worlds &quot;dis&quot;abled? At the very least, this gives me
<br>
(and hopefully actual real sci-fi writers lurking on this list) the
<br>
beginnings of what could be a poigniant and inspiring sci-fi story.
<br>
<p>Not just physical disabilities either. I remember reading someplace
<br>
that people with autism who have found jobs in the computer industry
<br>
sometimes find their autism to actually be an asset. I certainly find
<br>
that my own hyperactivity (ADD, whatever) gives me a useful sort of
<br>
flexibility (even though it prevents me from finishing the dozens of
<br>
projects I start).
