I've read a few articles today about a new robot recently shown by Honda, 
<br>
named ASIMO (<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/492638.asp">http://www.msnbc.com/news/492638.asp</a>). It seemed to be 
<br>
basically for show, doesn't appear to have any very profound AI, and the 
<br>
information on it is, obviously, only what is let out by Honda (I wonder how 
<br>
many times it fell over during the demonstration..). A video shows it 
<br>
walking up stairs, and I do not doubt that it was going through an 
<br>
inflexible program based on those specific stairs, and that it would have 
<br>
fallen over if it began its walk three inches back from where it started. I 
<br>
remember seeing a video of its precursor robot playing soccer, and the video 
<br>
had so many cuts, I know each one must have ended right before the robot 
<br>
tipped over.
<br>
But anyway, it still looks pretty impressive. With a lot of development, 
<br>
mainly along the lines of integrating other already-existing technologies, I 
<br>
think it could become much more versatile.
<br>
But I don't care about it walking around in my house, I'm interested in 
<br>
having my brain put into one. I'm generally interested in keeping a 
<br>
biological body but this would be good in the case of some accident or 
<br>
illness before that becomes possible, and I'm starting to think it will 
<br>
become possible sooner then a biologically grown body. By transplanting eyes 
<br>
and ears as well, or the already existing cochlear implants and the retinal 
<br>
implants currently being tested (<a href="http://www.optobionics.com">http://www.optobionics.com</a>), and natural 
<br>
nerve impulses controlling the movements of the robot, the only big thing 
<br>
missing is sustaining a brain inside.
<br>
So I'm wondering, what work has been or is being done on the &quot;brain in a 
<br>
vat&quot; scenerio - by that I just mean keeping it alive and functional. I 
<br>
assume there isn't much being done, so what is it that has to be done? I 
<br>
think some of the existing blood vessel structure leading into the brain 
<br>
would need to be preserved and some artificial blood, capable of providing 
<br>
the right nutrients and oxygen, and absorbing waste products, would need to 
<br>
be pumped through it. Some kind of filtering system in the robot could take 
<br>
care of that, with replentishment coming from some factory-made fluid. The 
<br>
only other thing I can think of is the immune system, which I really know 
<br>
nothing about at all (are white blood cells self reproducing or do they come 
<br>
from the marrow like red cells?).
<br>
In some situations this may be preferable to biological existence. By making 
<br>
some changes to account for temperature variations (keeping the brain at a 
<br>
constant temperature would be required anyway), the robot could basically be 
<br>
a space suit for the brain, or a diving suit.
<br>
Nobody say anything about uploading.. I'm thinking nearer term.
