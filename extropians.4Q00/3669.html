<em>&gt; When I said that Libertarianism requires a moral revolution, I was
</em><br>

<em>&gt; believes that it is one's moral duty to relinquish one's freedoms, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; included, they'll (surprise!) start up a government and initiate force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against you.
</em><br>
<p>I can't fully disagree.  But I note that most of the people around me
<br>
don't really give the matter much thought at all.  They've absorbed a
<br>
set of assumptions (memes) from local culture and act on them with
<br>
relatively little consideration.  I'm not sure if its any easier to
<br>
change the meme programming than to get them to think.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People have to vote libertarian, that is, they have to vote to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dismantle the government, or revolt, or whatever, or else the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government will exist and meddle (as people currently vote for it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do).  But they'll never do that unless their morals change rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drastically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Could you vote to dismantle government effectively in 1776?  I'm not
<br>
sure that can be effectively done in today's climate.  Again though, it
<br>
does not take a vast majority to produce real change.  It does take a
<br>
sufficient number who act reasonably coherently and effectively.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Samantha argued that it doesn't require that everyone get it... it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply requires that everyone let everyone else alone (unless they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiate force).  In other words, they don't have to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarianism, they just have to be libertarians in action.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounds like a moral revolution to me.  It's not happening this week, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promise you that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not libertarian in action so much as respecting people's rights to live
<br>
by their own lights as long as they aren't infringing on you.  I suspect
<br>
that message could be pretty popular with large segments that aren't and
<br>
never will be well described as Libertarian or &quot;libertarians in
<br>
action&quot;.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Similarly, Michael Lorrey said that all it takes is for self defense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be acceptable and for the initiation of force to be unacceptable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I don't know what sort of acceptability one would be talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless it were either legal acceptability or moral acceptability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Legal acceptability would follow only from moral acceptability; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people must choose to act to prevent initiation of force.  Now they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that it's everyone's moral duty to accept certain kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiations of force and to initiate force against others under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various conditions.  This would have to change before libertarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started to happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think they actually believe any such thing.  To believe  implies
<br>
giving some thought to.  This doesn't happen often enough.  To
<br>
successfully oppose the de facto decisions most live by might get more
<br>
people to actually think about these things.  That will be the beginning
<br>
of real change.  A 10 million dollar question is how to live as freely
<br>
as possible within this largely unfree environment and to promote change
<br>
successfully.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm saying that people have to decide to get out of everyone else's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way for libertarianism to happen.  They don't want that.  They want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be controlled, and they want you to be controlled as well.  Unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they change their minds on that, unless there's a moral revolution, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The first key to changing someone's mind is to be sure they recognize
<br>
that they have one and that they bear responsibility for some of its
<br>
contents and the results deriving from those contents.  I'm not holding
<br>
my breath.
