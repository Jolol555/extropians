<em>&gt; This summer, a professor plans to take a step closer to becoming a cyborg --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part human, part computer -- by implanting a silicon chip that communicates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with his brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>The rhetoric seems to be getting ahead of the reality here.  The chip
<br>
is being inserted into his arm, and it will clamp onto a nerve bundle
<br>
there try to stimulate and monitor it.  At most I would imagine he
<br>
will feel a tingling sensation in his arm.  There are probably millions
<br>
of individual nerve cell fibers in a single &quot;nerve&quot; bundle and so the
<br>
results are probably going to be pretty random.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So will Warwick's brain freak out during Project Cyborg 2.0? Will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the computer take over?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not likely, said Kennedy, who has experience with chip implants to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help the disabled communicate.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;His brain should be able to adapt to the incoming stimuli, recognize
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them and respond appropriately,&quot; Kennedy said.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;(Computers) have huge memory banks,&quot; he continued. &quot;We have intuition
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and insight the computers don't have. And we have the ability to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respond or not to respond.
<br>
<p>This is crazy.  His brain freaking out?  He's only affecting the nerves of
<br>
his arm.  The worst that could happen is that he could feel an unpleasant
<br>
sensation there, similar to when you get an electrical shock in your
<br>
fingers, or hit your &quot;funny bone&quot;.  And what does it mean for his brain to
<br>
&quot;respond appropriately&quot;?  That is meaningless in this context.
<br>
<p>This whole thing smacks of superstition and magical thinking.  They are
<br>
writing as though the mere act of hooking a computer chip to your nerves
<br>
is going to open up a whole new world of consciousness.  It doesn't
<br>
make sense.  You can stimulate your nerves just by touching your skin.
