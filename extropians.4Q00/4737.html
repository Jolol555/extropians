From: &quot;Emlyn&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:emlyn@one.net.au?Subject=Re:%20Bacteria%20question.&In-Reply-To=&lt;200012281634.IAA00882@well.com&gt;">emlyn@one.net.au</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;My daughter (5 yo) just asked me a question which I can't answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(not the first time for that!). I thought someone on the list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might be able to help.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;She knows a bit about bacteria. We've talked about cells &amp; other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;little things too... I'm going to get my hands on a microscope
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ASAP.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Anyway, I've told her about plaque in your mouth, and how it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bacteria chomping on your teeth, which are promoted by sugary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;foods. I could be wrong about that, I've just been pedalling the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;standard parent party line.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, she knows that sugar is used as a preservative in foods,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like jam.
</em><br>
<p>The sugar is not primarily a preservative in this case
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Another piece; she interogated me recently about food rotting; why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does it happen? I told her that bacteria eat it.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;So she has put these things together, and asks this question...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;If sugar is a preservative, and stops bacteria from eating food,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;why does it cause decay in teeth, which is due to promotion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bacteria?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm stumped. Help!
</em><br>
<p>The sugar is not really a preservative, but as someone already
<br>
explained it's properties as an osmotic in the thick jam would draw
<br>
the water out of the bacteria, killing them.
<br>
<p>In your mouth the sugar is food for the bacteria, just as it is for
<br>
us, the waste product of the bacteria is an acid, which weakens
<br>
tooth enamel.
<br>
<p>It is interesting to note that honey can last for many years
<br>
without going bad because of this same effect.
