<em>&gt; &gt;Well, one use of the Internet is for publishing web pages, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is akin to broadcasting.  Presumably your ban would need to apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to web publishers in addition to TV, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes
</em><br>
<p>I would say not. Web page publishing is publishing, while mass email is a
<br>
broadcast medium. The two are different. One depends on push, the other on pull.
<br>
It might be argued that because web publishing can be so up to the minute, it
<br>
might legalistically be considered more like broadcasting. I do like the idea of
<br>
waiting periods. If the 2nd amendment can have a 3 day waiting muzzle on it, the
<br>
same thing should apply to speech.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;An interesting example in the recent election was Matt Drudge,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;whose site drudgereport.com published the early exit poll results,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;contravening the stated policy of the consortium which conducted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the polls, Voter News Service.  He may still get sued for this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we'll see. Would you muzzle Matt Drudge?  Is he merely an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;influential individual, or does he count as a broadcaster?  How to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;decide?  What happens as others become successful publishing their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;own opinions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not muzzling anyone, I'm talking about delaying talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an on going process till it's completed. As I've already pointedout we have reasonable time delays on the Second Amendment already,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why not the first?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At some point individuals become &quot;common carriers&quot; and subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regulation.
</em><br>
<p>I would say that the standard for that should be set at interstate communication
<br>
and more than what? In terms of audience, if there is no associative enclosure
<br>
on audience membership (i.e. if you are not members of the same group, if you
<br>
have no registration and/or subscription process, your content is freely
<br>
available to all) then it might be more practically considered a broadcast, as
<br>
spam is for similar reasons.
