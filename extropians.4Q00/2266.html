Right. Politics is limited to stuffy guys in suits in front of
<br>
microphones and and occasional We Interrupt This Broadcast. All that
<br>
other stuff, mannnnn--that's like, HISTORY or something.

<p>Most people probably are as ignorant or intellectually lazy as that.
<br>
Blank looks abound.
<br>
I can't dispute what you say, but I can grimace in distaste.
