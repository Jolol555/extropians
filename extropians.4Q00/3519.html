<p><p>Drama queens my ass.  Let someone deny you the right to make whatever
<br>
binding agreement with whoever you choose and we'll see just how much
<br>
you appreciate being called &quot;drama queen&quot; when you raise hell about it. 
<br>
Your contention above is a blanket statement with no proof except a
<br>
couple of anecdotes.  Surely you see that is utterly unjustified?
