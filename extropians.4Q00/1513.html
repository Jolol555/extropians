This wasn't based on a physical theory, just empiry and material science.

People said many things, but I wonder why you keep mentioning that
<br>
&quot;people said&quot; thing. It bears no relevance to argumentation. People
<br>
also said witches don't float on water and the brain is an organ for
<br>
cooling of the blood, and that mice are generated spontaneously from
<br>
straw and dirty cloth, and that stones can't fall from the skies.

<br>
There is no debate. You can't signal faster than the speed of light in 
<br>
vacuum. If you've read more than that into it you fell into the trap
<br>
of wishful thinking.

<p><em> &gt; limit on that line, barring time travel, is being able to move instantly

1) No evidence for such physics

2) No evidence for anybody using such technology

3) Did I already mention 1) and 2)?

<p><em> &gt; &gt; Assuming that physics is not changeable, of course, which is a rather

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt; Give me fixed physics and a sufficiently large amount of ingenuity and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; resources, and I can get you practically anything.  (Some things are

<p>Such as relativity and breaking the speed of light in vacuum limit?

<p><em> &gt; impossible as is, but other things which serve the same ends as well or

</em><br>
<em> &gt; its expression - say, colonization of the universe with current
</em><br>
<em> &gt; technology - in order to discern the best way to satisfy it.)
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I would be foolish to assume that our current physics is accurate. In
<br>
fact we know it isn't. However, I would be doubly foolish to step
<br>
beyond the known laws, and start extrapolating. There are a lot of
<br>
these &quot;could be's&quot;, way more than there are neurons in my brain. I
<br>
prefer to engage them for more fruitful speculations, e.g. what's for
<br>
dinner.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; The Singularity, if it exists, doesn't peak.  It merely goes on until we
</em><br>
<p>The Singularity is a testable hypothesis about future civilisatory
<br>
development. We will know it when we get there, and not before.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; advance our ways of thinking sufficiently that we can see the future
</em><br>
<em> &gt; once more.  I base this claim on what I see every day, as some people
</em><br>
<p>Then why do you keep talking about things beyond the predictability
<br>
horizont? FTL, teleportation, fairies, the cow that jumped over the
<br>
Moon, ghosties &amp; goblins, ...
<br>
<p><em> &gt; think the immediate future is an unimaginable tech (u/dis)topia, until
</em><br>
<em> &gt; they get handle on the realities of what's out there.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, the truth is out there, somewhere, along with the Moon made from
<br>
green cheese and the X files.
