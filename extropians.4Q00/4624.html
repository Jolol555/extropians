<em>&gt; If you own an SF library plus a scanner with OCR, you're practically required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to scan it in, the rare and out-of-print books first.
</em><br>
<p>I was just thinking of this, also, part of it would be a computer network robot
<br>
program that would collect all the relevant newsgroups and search for relevant
<br>
webpages.  These, luckily (?) are machine-readable.
<br>
<p>Scanning books is destructive in its most exact way, where each page or pair of
<br>
facing apges is unbound and scanned in a flatbed or drum scanner, or one of the
<br>
high-resolution camera ones.  If you keep the spine on the book and scan facing pages
<br>
there are more artifacts in the image.  If it's on regular letter or legal sized
<br>
paper then you can put the documents in a sheet-fed scanner and get decent results
<br>
most of the time, and 100 kilobytes or much less of computer filesize for one letter
<br>
page of black and white document image scan at 300 dots per inch.  If you have the
<br>
original files, keep a copy.
<br>
<p>About OCR software, some of them let you add your own word dictionaries.  Another
<br>
good feature for OCR is learning OCR that you can retrain on your fonts.  In that
<br>
case, the OCR for Optical Character Recognition program is driven partly by a neural
<br>
or Bayesian network, so you can OCR new fonts and correct its idea of what it is.
<br>
<p>About having a science fiction library, there are many many people with fifty or more
<br>
SF books that might share in common few or no SF authors. That means there is a high
<br>
ratio of readers to authors, to where they are more even.
<br>
<p>Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays,
<br>
