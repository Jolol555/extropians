<p><em>&gt; The moral is that while the networks may have been guilty of simplistic

<p>Why?  Sorting either by total Buchanan votes or by
<br>
size of the county is sorting by an irrelevant statistic.  Why should
<br>
the size of the county be a factor?  If you arbitrarily drew two
<br>
lines to quadrisect Palm Beach county, the charts formed by
<br>
such sorting would change the picture significantly.  On the other
<br>
hand, all four quadrants of a chart sorted by percentage of Buchanan
<br>
votes should be unchanged by the arbitrary division, that is, all
<br>
four quadrants should still be a moderately Buchanan-favorable
<br>
0.79%.  So they like Buchanan down there in Palm Beach, that
<br>
should not be a shocker.  Some other counties like him even better.
<br>
<p>Do we really wish to argue that high population *density* should
<br>
lead to a lower *percentage* of legitimate Buchanan votes?  Why?
<br>
<p>Do allow me to put another spin on this that is relevant to extropians.
<br>
We know that the press can plant an idea in the minds of the masses.
<br>
What was done was to contact a telemarketing firm, which called a
<br>
bunch of people, thousands, and *planted in their brains* the idea
<br>
that they may have voted for the wrong guy, which they responded
<br>
to en-mass.  There were more people who signed petitions saying
<br>
they may have mistakenly voted for Buchanan than there were
<br>
Buchanan votes!
<br>
<p>The scary part of this is that the press has such power to influence
<br>
the masses, and that this may someday be very destructive to what
<br>
extropians wish to accomplish.  For instance, suppose truly dramatic
<br>
breakthrus begin to be made in life extension.  Could not the press
<br>
jump all over this, and plant in the minds of the masses the idea that
<br>
a few wealthy technocratic elite have discovered the fountain of
<br>
youth, which you, the poor victimized downtrodden proletariat, will
<br>
never be able to afford, but which will result the overpopulation of
<br>
our delicate planet and in your grandchildren and their grandchildren
<br>
to being robbed of their future and ground into poverty for perpetuity, etc.
<br>
<p>This display of power by the press is quite disturbing.  spike
