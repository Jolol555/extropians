<em>&gt; As I already pointed out, here in Illinois we did NOT get a choice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or at least a very poor one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no reason that all the candidates can't be allowed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participate in a debate or question or answer type session under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Universal access requirements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then the Borda style primary, followed by the conventions, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The current system is okay for New Hampshire, it seriously degrades
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every day after that. In other words it sucks for the rest of us.
</em><br>
<p>Only because candidates pull out of the race. If they don't even begin at all
<br>
due to an overwhelmingly huge financial barrier to entry, everyone gets screwed,
<br>
and you never hear about possible alternatives. Here's my ideas:
<br>
<p>a) Similar to as you suggested, I'd say that network television and radio have
<br>
to carry all candidates ads/videos as public service ads. To qualify all one has
<br>
to do is get 100,000 signatures on a petition.
<br>
<p>b) have a half dozen small states and or selected large counties in different
<br>
regions that generally reflect a composite of the country as a whole. Hold these
<br>
early primaries in sequence several days apart, or all at once. Have the rest as
<br>
a Super Tuesday a month or two later.
<br>
<p>Frankly, I don't have much sympathy for large population states. They typically
<br>
hold excessive power in congress to bring pork spending to their states at the
<br>
expense of small states who don't have as large state caucuses. They
<br>
consequently receive disporportionately more back in federal grants and spending
<br>
than they contribute in taxes. Its just too damn bad if the one place where they
<br>
don't have an advantage is in primaries.
