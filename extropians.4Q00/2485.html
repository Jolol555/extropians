<em>&gt; Subject: Re: RANT

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Of course, extropy has been called a cult before, usually by trolls,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; much like yourself.  As there is no particular OTHER reason to call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extropianism a cult, (as I'll attempt to show), usually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they fall back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on calling us dogmatists, which, I have to presume, is what you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; driving at in your parody of an extropian calling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deep-ecologists &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; DEVIL.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wasn't calling it a cult- I was just referring to the attitude many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians have regarding &quot;The Singularity&quot;.  We're running out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources, destroying our environment- yet you seem to think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we'll be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saved by this occurence.  I think otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>Do you think we will be saved by anything else?  Do you think switching to
<br>
all solar, geothermal, wind and so on will save us?  Do you think (SI help
<br>
us) that redistributing all the wealth equally will save us?  Better tech is
<br>
essential to solving most of our resource issues.  Better personal and
<br>
collective intelligence (largely but not totally via technology) and better
<br>
psychology are essential to finding and applying solutions.  
<br>
<p>Did you ever read Julian Simon?  We create new resources using our
<br>
intelligence and a (relatively) free market.  Given enough technology we can
<br>
heal the environment to better than mythological Garden of Eden standards.
<br>
But most Greens tend to ignore such inconvenient facts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think he and I agree that there is not only a non-trivial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; apocalyptic disaster in the next century, (a possibility which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everyone became aware of around the time of the cold war,) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but also a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chance of unprecedented wealth, longevity, and, dare I say it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happiness.  Neither of these possibilities is inevitable, though I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think they're quite likely outcomes of the next century or two.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By apocalypse, I was not referring to disaster, but to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapture.  Where is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all this wealth going to come from, with our resources 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroyed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasteful behavior of the 20th century?  Where is this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longevity going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come from, with our veins filled with carcinogens and our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodies bombarded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by radiation?  Where is this happiness going to come from, with our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spirituality destroyed by &quot;flatlander&quot; philosophers, our arts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smashed by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media concerned only with profits, living in a world where we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sunup until sundown with no hope for another world hereafter?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Wealth comes from where it always does, from applied intelligence.  Increase
<br>
the intelligence and the efficacy of its application and you increase
<br>
wealth.  Wealth is not a matter of static resources.  Resources themselves
<br>
are not static in a fundamental sense.   In case you haven't noticed our
<br>
lifetimes are increasing already even without the coming nanomedical (and
<br>
other) medical advances.  Your portrayal of the amount of carcinogens and
<br>
pollutants and their effect on human longevity is grossly out-of-date.   
<br>
<p>Spiritualities, as much as I think of some aspects of some of them, have not
<br>
produced very much happiness historically.  They have excused and
<br>
strengthened many utter atrocities along with what comfort some gained.  The
<br>
worse flatlanders have been religious throughout western history.  
<br>
<p>I don't see fine arts being smashed by the media any time soon.  
<br>
<p>Who needs a world hereafter when this very world we live in (and the near
<br>
universe in the bargain) can be turned into as much and more of a paradise
<br>
than even most mystics dared dream of?  What is you hurry to leave when the
<br>
curtain is just beginning to rise?  
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But it is in holding these beliefs *tentatively*, and in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not allowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our beliefs to be determined by a leader or any other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person, that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; demonstrate our rationality (in particular, our rejection of dogma).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We are not cultists or dogmatists of any other kind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rationalism is a dogma in of itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That highly dogmatic statement has very little semantic content.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't know much about Gnosticism.  I do know that typical Gnostics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have tended to prioritize the &quot;spiritual&quot; realm over the &quot;physical&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; realm.  I rather doubt most extropians would agree with that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but they were working from an ascending paradigm.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropianism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gnosticism reversed, the exact same stand within a descending 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradigm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>How so?  My paradigm and that of many other Extropians is quite ascending.
