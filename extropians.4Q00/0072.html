<em> &gt; Nonsense. Friendly means behavior typical of a friend; showing friendship;

Adolf Hitler was a warm personality, he really liked Bormann's eight
<br>
children. According to you, he was Jewish children's best friend, too.
<br>
<p>Sorry, now it is my turn to cry nonsense.
<br>
<p>According to Eliezer, I'm evil. This probably means I'm UnFriendly
<br>
relatively to him. Now the SI is both Friendly to me and Eliezer,
<br>
according to Eliezer. But I don't want it to be Friendly to Eliezer,
<br>
because he's on the Good People List, and I'm on the Evil People List
<br>
(and everybody knows Evil people can't be Friendly to Good people). If
<br>
it's Friendly to Eliezer I consider it to be UnFriendly to me.
<br>
<p>Hmm. Now, I'm not as smart as Eliezer, but I seem to see some problems
<br>
with that logic.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; AI would want to be friendly because it's the intelligent thing to do.
</em><br>
<p>Hitler would want to be friendly because it's the Nazi thing to do.
<br>
<p>So, the thread has ended, you have won, let's move on to something
<br>
new. I suggest we move on to NRA and gun legislation. And whether bees
<br>
have stings.
