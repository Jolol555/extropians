<em>&gt; My middle name is Anton.  Four years ago, I wrote some articles for a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minor zines under the name N. Anton MacDonald.

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am from Sioux Falls.  Where in the hell did you pull that out of?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, you didn't get the whole story.  My mother may have wanted a girl-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my parents were either going to name me Nicholas or Nicolette- but I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an only child, and I never stole a book from my grade school library.  Well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I kept a few of them longer than I was supposed to... especially the ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with completed BASIC scripts in them, and the one on creating terrariums...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that's it! ;)
</em><br>
<p>Damn.  Guess I blew my bluff.  Well, it seemed like a good try at the
<br>
time.  I was also going to say that you were born under the sign of Leo -
<br>
figured I had one chance in twelve of being right.  Then I deleted it,
<br>
since I figured I had one chance in twelve of being right.
<br>
<p>Good thing, too, since you're a Capricorn.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You read all that Aleister Crowley, and then look for simple little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; physical explanations when something marvelous comes along.  Unweave a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rainbow...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, considering the quote that I frequently use as a sig, that one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious enough.
</em><br>
<p>Huh.  I didn't even notice that.  Well, despite the sig, your favorite
<br>
Crowley book is &quot;Magick in Theory and Practice&quot;, not &quot;Original Sin&quot;, which
<br>
you feel is lacking in depth.  And you're also a fan of Peter Carroll.
