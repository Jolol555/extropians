<p><em>&gt; I think that many who fought for democratic nations did so because they were

drafted
<br>

</em><br>
motivations
<br>
<em>&gt; to do so were probably of the following camps:  1: those who sought to
</em><br>
preserve and
<br>
<em>&gt; extend democracy, 2: those fighting against atrocities against civilians, and
</em><br>
3:
<br>
<em>&gt; those figting or working to promote democracy as well as bring about the
</em><br>
downfall of
<br>
<em>&gt; blatant tyranny.  Each one was an individual.
</em><br>
<p>Nonetheless, conscientious objectors and non-combatant draftees abounded. So did
<br>
female workers in bomb factories. I had referred to willing warriors, eager
<br>
soldiers, those who fought for god and country.
<br>
If making the world safe for democracy requires a world war, then let's replace
<br>
democracy with meritocracy.
<br>
Except for the professional soldiers (the gung-ho types I was talking about)
<br>
they were all civilians before they were drafted.
<br>
When you get run over by a tank, it doesn't really matter which side's tyrant
<br>
sent it.

<em>&gt; Someone in an unrelated post noted that humans fight each other because there
</em><br>
is no
<br>
<em>&gt; one else to fight.  It's the species' immune system, in a metaphorical sense.
</em><br>
<p>In a metaphorical sense (and even in a non-metaphorical sense), when the immune
<br>
system attacks its own organs, it's time for an immune system tune-up. A
<br>
hay-wire immune system can kill as surely as a disease. It seems extropic to me
<br>
to replace war with something else... like maybe a technological singularity.
