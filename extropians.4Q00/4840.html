<p>NEUROSCIENCE: Boosting Working Memory
<br>
<p>Trevor W. Robbins, Mitul A. Mehta, Barbara J.  Sahakian*
<br>
<p>Many parts of the brain are involved in the formation and storage of
<br>
long- and short-term memory.  Working memory--a form of short-term
<br>
memory that depends on different populations of brain neurons, in
<br>
particular those in the prefrontal cortex--serves to maintain
<br>
temporary, active representations of information that can be rapidly
<br>
recalled (1). Neurons in the prefrontal cortex and associated areas
<br>
receive input from cholinergic pathways comprising neurons that
<br>
release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which originate in the
<br>
reticular core of the brainstem and basal forebrain (see the
<br>
figure). This anatomical organization leads to an obvious strategy for
<br>
improving working memory: increasing the amount of acetylcholine in
<br>
synapses. That this strategy works is demonstrated by Furey et al. (2)
<br>
on page 2315 of this issue. Using functional magnetic resonance
<br>
imaging (fMRI), these authors show that enhancing cholinergic activity
<br>
with the drug physostigmine (which blocks the breakdown of
<br>
acetylcholine) improves the efficiency of working memory in humans.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Multitasking in the brain. The main ascending cholinergic and
<br>
&nbsp;monoaminergic pathways in the brain and their possible contributions
<br>
&nbsp;to working memory (2, 3, 11, 12). Different neurotransmitter
<br>
&nbsp;pathways--acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine
<br>
&nbsp;(NE)--modulate working memory through separate mechanisms.  It remains
<br>
&nbsp;unclear whether the serotonin pathway (not shown) is involved in
<br>
&nbsp;working memory (12). For clarity, the back-projections from the
<br>
&nbsp;frontal cortex and the projections between the neurotransmitter groups
<br>
&nbsp;have been omitted.  DLPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; VLPFC,
<br>
&nbsp;ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; VTA/SN, ventral tegmental
<br>
&nbsp;area/substantia nigra pars compacta; LC, locus coeruleus; NBM, nucleus
<br>
&nbsp;basalis of Meynert; BS-ACh, brainstem cholinergic neurons. The
<br>
&nbsp;projections depicted reflect possible modulatory influences on working
<br>
&nbsp;memory. Anatomically, the NBM and LC project to most of the cortical
<br>
&nbsp;mantle and the VTA/SN has fewer projections in more posterior regions
<br>
&nbsp;(13).
<br>
<p><p>Brains of human subjects performing a visual recognition task were
<br>
imaged first during infusion of physostigmine, and then, on a
<br>
subsequent day, during infusion of a saline placebo (2). The visual
<br>
recognition task comprised three stages--3 seconds to visualize a
<br>
human face (encoding), a 9-second pause during which the face is
<br>
&quot;held&quot; in working memory (memory), and then presentation of the
<br>
original face and a new face, requiring that one face be recognized
<br>
(recognition). In the new work (2), and in two previous studies using
<br>
positron emission tomography (PET) (3), physostigmine accelerated the
<br>
subjects' ability to recognize visual stimuli (human faces). In the
<br>
PET studies, this improvement correlated with a decrease in brain
<br>
activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex--a region of the brain
<br>
considered crucial for accurate working memory--and an increase in
<br>
brain activity in regions of the visual cortex. Because of the poorer
<br>
temporal resolution of PET compared with fMRI, the PET work did not
<br>
provide information on the parts of the brain that were activated at
<br>
each stage of the visual recognition task.
<br>
<p>With fMRI, Furey et al. (2) now show that the increased activity in
<br>
the visual cortex after physostigmine treatment occurred during the
<br>
encoding of faces.  Therefore, improved working memory performance may
<br>
be due, in part, to enhancement of the earliest stages of visual
<br>
processing in the cortex, possibly through an increase in the
<br>
signal-to-noise ratio of neuronal information processing
<br>
(4). Increased visual processing in response to physostigmine is
<br>
consistent with results from other work in which animals were infused
<br>
intracerebrally with selective cholinergic agents (5), but it is
<br>
unclear how the Furey results relate to other findings in experimental
<br>
animals. For example, Furey and colleagues suggest that, for certain
<br>
types of memory, boosting the input of visual information leads to
<br>
reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex. However, injection into the
<br>
rat prefrontal cortex of muscarinic or nicotinic receptor
<br>
antagonists--which prevent acetylcholine from binding to its
<br>
receptors--produces different profiles of impairment on two working
<br>
memory tasks; only the more demanding task was impaired by the
<br>
nicotinic receptor antagonist (6). This raises the possibility that
<br>
acetylcholine might have different effects depending on whether it
<br>
binds to muscarinic or nicotinic receptors.  Consistent with this
<br>
notion, in both normal volunteers and patients with Alzheimer's
<br>
disease, nicotine improves performance on working memory tasks that
<br>
demand heightened attention (4).
<br>
<p>The drug-induced changes seen by Furey and co-workers in the
<br>
prefrontal cortex during face recognition, unlike those in the
<br>
posterior regions of the brain, were not preferentially associated
<br>
with any particular stage of the task. The authors choose to explain
<br>
this finding in terms of the Petrides model of working memory
<br>
(7). This model assigns the more passive (&quot;on-line&quot;) short-term
<br>
maintenance of information (8) and the more active (&quot;executive&quot;)
<br>
processing of information held on-line to the ventral and dorsal
<br>
regions of the prefrontal cortex, respectively. The investigators
<br>
postulate that decreased dorsal prefrontal cortex activity reflects
<br>
reduced requirements for &quot;executive&quot; operations after increased
<br>
posterior cortical activity. But not all activity in the prefrontal
<br>
cortex was reduced during the face recognition task after
<br>
physostigmine infusion; increased activity was still observed in the
<br>
inferior prefrontal cortex. As the authors point out, it is unclear
<br>
whether the activity of this area subsumes the ventrolateral
<br>
prefrontal cortex. If this area is close to the ventrolateral
<br>
prefrontal cortex (area BA47), then this might reflect enhancement of
<br>
the entire network of &quot;on-line&quot; working memory (7). The precise
<br>
relationship between working memory and different regions within the
<br>
prefrontal cortex is currently the subject of intense debate (8). The
<br>
Furey et al. study can now be extended with different working memory
<br>
tasks that vary in their degree of &quot;executive&quot; and perceptual
<br>
requirements. Thus, the final interpretation of drug-related changes
<br>
in the prefrontal cortex will ultimately depend on exactly which parts
<br>
of the prefrontal cortex carry out each stage of working memory and on
<br>
the exact brain regions where drug-induced changes in activity occur.
<br>
<p>Modulating the activity of monoaminergic neuronal pathways (that
<br>
release monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine and
<br>
norepinephrine) controls dynamic neural networks in the neocortex (9,
<br>
10). For example, methylphenidate (an indirect enhancer of dopamine
<br>
and norepinephrine) decreases the activity of a working memory
<br>
&quot;circuit&quot; that includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the
<br>
posterior parietal cortex, while improving overall performance on a
<br>
memory task (10). Together with the new Furey et al. findings, these
<br>
studies raise the exciting possibility that aspects of working memory
<br>
may be improved by drugs with selective actions on different
<br>
neurotransmitter systems, resulting in possible therapeutic benefits
<br>
for patients with cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
