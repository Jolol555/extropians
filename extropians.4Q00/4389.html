</em><br>
<p>Due to a family medical emergency, I had to drop out of the 
<br>
discussion, but I've been following the thread.  I read with 
<br>
appreciation the information, provided by both you and Harvey, on Al 
<br>
Gore's role in the popularization of the Internet.  I've been on the 
<br>
Internet since the late 80's, but I wasn't very concerned with the 
<br>
politics of it, since I was too busy playing the early MUDs and 
<br>
stuff. :)
<br>
<p>Despite my dislike of Al Gore, I think it's fair to say that Al Gore 
<br>
was ahead of the curve in the congress regarding the Internet.  I 
<br>
think that he at least raised the consciousness of normally 
<br>
technophobic senators on this issue, and he should get credit for 
<br>
that.
<br>
<p>My problem, however, is with what he actually said:  &quot;During my 
<br>
service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in 
<br>
creating the Internet.&quot;
<br>
<p>He could have said lots of things:
<br>
- I took the initiative to ease restrictions on access to what would 
<br>
eventually become the Internet.
<br>
- In the Senate, I championed bringing the technology of the Internet 
<br>
to the general public.
<br>
- I pushed legislation through congress that helped change the 
<br>
Internet from something that was a little-known tool for scientists 
<br>
and academics into the publicly accessible technological achievement 
<br>
of our generation.
<br>
<p>... but he didn't.  Instead, Al Gore - a professional politician who 
<br>
has spent his whole career expressing himself to the public - chose 
<br>
to take almost complete credit for the creation of the Internet.
<br>
<p>Yes, I know that Republicans exaggerate what he said by misquoting, 
<br>
&quot;I invented the Internet.&quot;  Yes, I know that Democrats are right in 
<br>
saying that there was some truth in what he said.
<br>
<p>Some truth, however, doesn't really cut it.  There was also &quot;some 
<br>
truth&quot; in statements from him and his mentor:
<br>
<p>&quot;I did not have sex with that woman&quot;
<br>
&quot;I drank lots of tea and was in the bathroom a lot&quot;
<br>
&quot;We just want to make sure that every vote is counted&quot;
<br>
<p>The parts of those statements, and what they imply, that aren't truth 
<br>
are what concern me.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
