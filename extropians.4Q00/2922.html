<p>NanoManipulator Lets Chemists Go Mano a Mano
<br>
With Molecules
<br>
<p>Mark Sincell*
<br>
<p>Interacting with the nanoworld is like shadowboxing in the
<br>
dark. Because objects only a few molecules across are too small to be
<br>
seen or touched directly, scientists approach them essentially blind
<br>
and numb. Now a team of physicists, chemists, biologists, and computer
<br>
scientists at the University of North Carolina (UNC), Chapel Hill, has
<br>
developed a tool that restores their eyes and fingers. It's called the
<br>
nanoManipulator.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is like the movie Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, except you don't
<br>
really get smaller,&quot; says UNC computer scientist Warren Robinett. &quot;We
<br>
reconstruct your perception so that you see and feel exactly what you
<br>
would if you were the size of a virus.&quot; Robinett created the
<br>
nanoManipulator with chemist Stan Williams, who is now the director of
<br>
basic research in the physical sciences at Hewlett-Packard. The device
<br>
&quot;puts humans in the loop in a very nice way,&quot; says Ari Requicha, an
<br>
electrical engineer who works on virtual reality interfaces at the
<br>
University of Southern California in Los Angeles.
<br>
<p>Robinett and Williams, who have been friends since their undergraduate
<br>
days in the early 1970s, came up with the idea for the nanoManipulator
<br>
during a 1991 phone call. At the time, Williams was trying to string
<br>
single silicon atoms into a nanoscale wire, but he was frustrated by
<br>
his inability to touch the atoms.  &quot;Chemists want to get their hands
<br>
on stuff,&quot; he says. For his part, Robinett was looking for a safer
<br>
application of his expertise in programming people-sized robots that
<br>
mimic the motions of their human operator. When working with big
<br>
machines, Robinett explains, &quot;a bug in your program can turn a robot
<br>
into an eggbeater, and it can punch a hole in your skull.&quot;
<br>
<p>To Robinett, the scanning probe microscope (SPM) that Williams used to
<br>
view his surfaces looked like a small and safe robot. Instead of the
<br>
robot's TV camera eyes, the SPM has a computer-controlled probe that
<br>
&quot;looks like an upside-down pyramid at the end of a flexible diving
<br>
board,&quot; says UNC computer scientist Russell Taylor. The probe skates
<br>
across the silicon surface, and a computer interface converts the
<br>
probe's wiggles into an electric signal, a bit like the way a
<br>
phonograph needle creates sounds from the bumps in a vinyl record.
<br>
<p>The probe can also be programmed to push against the surface like a
<br>
robotic finger. In the push mode, scanning tunneling microscopes
<br>
(STMs) are commonly used to photograph products of chemical reactions,
<br>
measure the mechanical properties of various materials, and rearrange
<br>
atoms and bend carbon nanotubes.  But there's a problem. To point the
<br>
tip in the correct direction, researchers first scan the surface and
<br>
find the target in the resulting three-dimensional (3D) image. Then,
<br>
they must switch from visualization mode to manipulation mode, program
<br>
the STM tip to move to the right spot, and finally press it against
<br>
the surface. In the meantime, thermal vibrations of the surface might
<br>
have bounced the atom away from the tip's preprogrammed target. It is
<br>
like trying to play blindfolded billiards during an earthquake.
<br>
<p>But even in the push mode, the changing separation between the flexing
<br>
tip and its fixed mount creates an electric current that is
<br>
proportional to the pressure exerted on the tip. By transmitting that
<br>
current to the proper computer interface, Robinett and Williams
<br>
realized that a human could locate the target object by touch at the
<br>
same time they were pushing gently against it. All Robinett had to do
<br>
was revamp his human-sized robot control programs to link the
<br>
microscopic &quot;robot&quot; to a human. And the nanoManipulator was born.
<br>
<p>In its current form, the nanoManipulator is a computer program that
<br>
fuses an STM with a real-time 3D graphics rendering program and a
<br>
haptic interface that fits over one finger like a high-tech
<br>
thimble. The scientist's fingertip gets a little push each time the
<br>
probe hits a bump. And when the scientist pushes back with his finger,
<br>
a nanoscale finger presses against the surface.
<br>
<p>&quot;The key to the manipulator is that it immerses users in the
<br>
environment so they develop a good feel for what they are doing,&quot; says
<br>
electrical engineer Joe Lyding, an expert in molecular computing and
<br>
visualization at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. For
<br>
example, a user can tell the difference between signal noise and real
<br>
texture by simply running a &quot;finger&quot; over the surface, says Williams,
<br>
who has also used the nanoManipulator to &quot;nanoweld&quot; atoms into a wire
<br>
strand.
<br>
<p>Garrett Matthews, a graduate student in physics at UNC, is using the
<br>
nanoManipulator to figure out if a virus feels more like a cue ball, a
<br>
tennis ball, or a rotten tomato. The results are inconclusive. &quot;Right
<br>
now it feels like a cue ball, but we have other measurements that
<br>
indicate it should be soft and sticky,&quot; says Matthews.  Versions of
<br>
the nanoManipulator are also being used by chemists and materials
<br>
scientists at Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, the University
<br>
of Toronto, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and
<br>
Arizona State University in Tempe.
<br>
<p>Williams is not surprised at the device's increasing popularity. &quot;We
<br>
used to have to stare for hours at a black-and-white picture of a
<br>
surface just to tell what was up and what was down,&quot; he says. &quot;The
<br>
nanoManipulator has untied our hands and opened our senses.&quot;
