You had nothing?  At least that's something!  We didn't have 
<br>
anything.  We didn't even have the concept of &quot;having&quot;.  Concepts 
<br>
hadn't been invented yet.  We didn't even know we didn't have 
<br>
anything, because we couldn't conceive a concept that hadn't been 
<br>
invented yet.
<br>
<p>We weren't just pre-Thought.  We were pre-Big-Bang!  Pre-Time.  We 
<br>
were even pre-Us.  We weren't even there yet!  Nobody was anywhere 
<br>
yet.  There wasn't even a &quot;yet&quot; yet.  And when the Big Bang was about 
<br>
to start, *everything* was uphill, infinitely in all directions.  We 
<br>
had up-hill in dimensions that don't even exist anymore today.
<br>
<p>It couldn't have been any worse, because nobody had invented &quot;worse&quot; 
<br>
yet.  There was no worse.  Nobody had anything worse.  You couldn't 
<br>
get worse.  We would have killed for worse!  When something worse did 
<br>
finally come along we couldn't even get that.  Nothing could get 
<br>
worse.  There was nothing worse.
