<p>Curt, Im not saying I disagree exactly, but reread the three sentences
<br>
in your first paragraph.  It is not at all clear to me that they support
<br>
each other in any way.  Certainly we are attracted to the right bumps,
<br>
the singing, the conversation, the clothes, notions all perfectly in accordance
<br>
with those presented in Geoffrey Miller's The Mating Mind.  It is not
<br>
clear to me from your discussion, however that sexual selection cues
<br>
are learned behaviors.  Looks to me like most of them are instinctive.
<br>
<p>If I had the ability to choose the sexual cues that would turn
<br>
me on, I would select those that would have secondary benefits,
<br>
such as overweight and wealthy.  Reasoning: since the pool of
<br>
competitors for overweight mates is smaller, my individual
<br>
probability of success in mate attraction would be higher if
<br>
I were to hunt in that field.
<br>
<p>If turn-ons are basically instinctive and we have no real control
<br>
over them, I (and many others of us) are forced into competing
<br>
for the thinner mates against other males who are more fit in
<br>
the sense that they present greater appeal to the instincts of
<br>
the ever shrinking pool of underweight females in this world
<br>
of well fed populations.
<br>
<p>Please dont flame me, just consider the argument: many
<br>
men actually *reduce* their chances of reproductive
<br>
success by our evidently-inborn instinct for liking thin.  spike
