<br>
<p>LURKING in the oceans are creatures that can create balls of plasma almost
<br>
as
<br>
hot as the surface of the Sun, a Dutch researcher has found. No, they aren't
<br>
the stars of a monster movie, but shrimps that live on coral reefs.
<br>
<p>Snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis) have an outsized claw that they use
<br>
to fire jets of water at their prey and each other. The noise that they make
<br>
pervades the ocean, drowning out the sounds of ships and other animals.
<br>
&quot;Submarines can use the shrimp to hide,&quot; says Detlef Lohse of the University
<br>
of Twente in the Netherlands.
<br>
<p>To understand the source of this cacophony, Lohse and his colleagues filmed
<br>
the shrimp with a high-speed camera and found that the snapping sound comes
<br>
before the claws shut. The noise is generated not by the clicking claws, but
<br>
by tiny bubbles in the water jet that expand and then collapse violently--a
<br>
process known as cavitation (Science, vol 289, p 2114).
<br>
<p>But the researchers also suspected that these cavitating bubbles might be
<br>
producing light as well as sound through a phenomenon called
<br>
sonoluminescence. When the bubbles collapse, any gas or water vapour inside
<br>
them is compressed, which can raise its temperature to startling levels and
<br>
give off light (New Scientist, 21 November 1998, p 27).
<br>
<p>Further experiments suggest that sonoluminescence is occurring in the water
<br>
jets fired by the shrimp. &quot;The preliminary results hint at light emission,
<br>
but more work is in progress,&quot; Lohse reports.
<br>
<p>He estimates that the temperature inside the collapsing bubbles is around
<br>
5000 °C. &quot;It's a cold plasma,&quot; he says. These extreme conditions only last
<br>
for around 200 picoseconds, however, and are most common 3 millimetres from
<br>
the tip of the shrimp's claw, so it seems unlikely that the animals are
<br>
using
<br>
the balls of plasma as weapons.
