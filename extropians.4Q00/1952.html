Greetings. I joined the Extropian Institute a couple of days ago, and this 
<br>
mailing list shortly afterwards, and I figured I should introduce myself (and 
<br>
also to put forward my $0.02 on the approval procedure topic).
<br>
<p>My name is C.J. I'm a writer and game designer residing in the Northeastern 
<br>
U.S. I am a devout follower of science fact and science fiction, a reader of 
<br>
Drexler and Sagan as well as Brin and Asimov. When a link at a Skeptic web 
<br>
page led me to the Extropian Institute, I was highly impressed by its 
<br>
philosophy. I believe that science and technology, not religion and 
<br>
mysticism, are the true sources of meaning and hope for humanity. I'm not a 
<br>
Libertarian (mainly because I don't think the conditions are right for such a 
<br>
philosophy to be practical), but can respect those who are. And I'm looking 
<br>
forward to reading (and participating in) this mailing list.
<br>
<p>About the list approval debate currently going on (which admittedly doesn't 
<br>
affect me, since I joined the institute and already have provided personal 
<br>
and financial information) -- I can see the need for such rules (I've seen 
<br>
the problems trolls can initiate in mailing lists), although it would be nice 
<br>
if prospective members were allowed to read the list archives before making 
<br>
the decision to provide personal information. I don't think it's a huge 
<br>
hardship to have to provide this information, IMHO. 
<br>
<p>CJC
