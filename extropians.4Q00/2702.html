<br>
<p><em>&gt;If &quot;real science&quot; is so great, why did my love affair with it end when I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;15?
</em><br>
<p><p>Ahh... then it's time to wake up the child in you!
<br>
<p>Have you ever imagined looking at the world through a child's eyes,
<br>
when everything is fresh and new and interesting, and you can't
<br>
help being curious about what it all is?
<br>
<p>Hmmm ...
<br>
<p>(Still having trouble waking up that inner child?)
<br>
<p>Then perhaps seeing some words from some children can help.
<br>
<p>Here are questions that I was asked by some children when I was
<br>
working at my previous job, during which some of that time,
<br>
I spent teaching kids about the Sun.
<br>
<p>-----begin children's questions-----------------------------------
<br>
<p>Can a space man go to the sun at night so it will not be too hot?
<br>
<p>How come the sky looks blue from earth and black from a rocket ship?
<br>
<p>How much bigger is the sun than Germany?
<br>
<p>Does sun turn like the earth turns?
<br>
<p>Because the sun is so bad for your skin, I don't usually stay out
<br>
in the sun very much anymore, but I like looking healthy.  Is there a
<br>
safe way I  can get a tan like that actor, George Hamilton?
<br>
<p>In the movie Lost In Space, the ship they were in flew through the sun.
<br>
Could this ever be possible?  Wouldn't the ship melt?
<br>
<p>How is the Solar System related to math??
<br>
<p>How can you cook marshmallows by solar heat?
<br>
<p>If the sun is a star why can't we see it at night?
<br>
<p>If there were two suns in one solar system, would they pull one another apart
<br>
because of the gravitational pull?
<br>
<p>How did atoms form?
<br>
<p>Planets in the solar system have moons that orbit them.  Do moons have
<br>
any objects that orbit them?
<br>
<p>I was told by Joe Phoenix that if i went up in outer space
<br>
in a rocketship i would not be able to see the sun as we see it on earth.
<br>
In other words he is saying you cannot see the light of the sun from space.
<br>
Please say it ain't so!
<br>
<p>How was the Sun born?
<br>
<p>The planets currently use names that are based on Greek or
<br>
Roman gods.  At one time our sun was called Helios or Sol.
<br>
Why do we not call the sun by those names?  When did we start
<br>
calling the sun &quot;Sun&quot;?
<br>
<p>Why doesn't the hurricane on Jupiter ever stop?
<br>
<p>Why is the Oort Cloud so far from the sun?
<br>
<p>What is the tornado on Neptune made of?
<br>
<p>Is human life possible on any other planet?
<br>
<p>What causes a harvest moon?
<br>
<p>What is it like to fly in a spaceship?
<br>
<p>Do blackholes really suck things?
<br>
<p>What happens to a burned out star?
<br>
<p>Are there other planets besides the 10 in the milky way?
<br>
<p>For a class asiment we were asked the question HOW DOSE THE
<br>
TEMPERATURE CHANGE BASED ON LOCATION?  I saw yuor site and
<br>
decided to ask of your knowlage.  See when I grow up I want
<br>
to be a Physicist.  I haven't chosen what feild yet.  Please
<br>
help me with this answer.
<br>
<p>(BTW, this last was from a little girl.. Yahoo!)
<br>
<p>-----end children's questions-----------------------------------
<br>
<p>I don't know about you, but seeing questions like these can't help
<br>
but make me think that the Universe is a remarkable place, and help
<br>
me feel that it's all worthwhile.
<br>
<p>I've been in my scientific field for about 20 years, and I've
<br>
&quot;rediscovered&quot; it again and again. Even though there were times when
<br>
my enthusiasm for it faded, I could/can trust that some triggering event
<br>
will jar my knot of dissatisfaction loose, and I'm bouncing away
<br>
with it once again.
<br>
<p>Here I show one rediscovery of my love of science, when I wrote the
<br>
article about Fiorella Terenzi about 5 years ago for Extropy mag:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.amara.com/fio/fio_epilog.html">http://www.amara.com/fio/fio_epilog.html</a>
<br>
<p>And here is something that I wrote more recently -- A kind of
<br>
&quot;stream of consciousness poetry&quot;
<br>
<p>------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>I am alive.
<br>
<p>I press the dust on my canvas with my finger and examine the print.
<br>
My print of unique cracks through which my ageless eyes observed the
<br>
events of my life.
<br>
<p>The dust wakes out of its slumber and I follow its passage.
<br>
As the dust marks my past, I laugh, despair, risk, care, learn, bleed,
<br>
love, dance, scream, change, and give, striving to be more.
<br>
<p>My fingers close around my memories and I fall into a waking dream.
<br>
<p>The dust glides through the universe from moons to planets and up to
<br>
... oops ...and around, into disks of new stars and through comet breezes.
<br>
The dust is a piece of me, or am I a piece of dust?
<br>
<p>We fly from the ecliptic brightness, feel comforted by the local fluff,
<br>
and have a ceylon tea at the cosmic tea table with our friends from
<br>
beta Pic. They don't laugh at my jokes but I smile anyway.
<br>
<p>I am alive.

<br>
<p>So wake up that child inside of you. It's there. Trust me. :-)
