<em>&gt; Extrops, should people with transhuman, cyborg, evolutionary, individual

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; about them and unplugged?
</em><br>
<p>Naturally, this is a decision that each person should make for himself.
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that many &quot;underdeveloped&quot; humans will be that way because
<br>
they want to be.  They are not interested in becoming transhuman cyborgs.
<br>
This is fine, and we should respect their wishes.
<br>
<p>However for those who want to enhance themselves but are too poor to do
<br>
so, those of us who are more fortunate may choose to help them.  In that
<br>
case I would suggest the principle of triage: separate the poor into
<br>
those who will make it without your help, those who will make it only
<br>
with your help, and those who would not make it even if you help them.
<br>
Focus your efforts on the second group.  This is how you can give the
<br>
greatest benefit with less than infinite resources.
<br>
<p>Several Extropians have pointed to the Grameen Bank, <a href="http://grameen-info.org">http://grameen-info.org</a>,
<br>
as an organization which provides highly cost-effective benefits to Third
<br>
World countries.  They provide loans to poor people who would otherwise be
<br>
unable to get them.  This selects the poor who have initiative and desire
<br>
but who are too limited in resources to put their ideas into action.
<br>
<p>As we move forward, it may be possible to use the Grameen principles
<br>
as guidelines for helping poor people in disadvantaged circumstances to
<br>
take advantage of the new technologies which will come into existence.
