First you have to have the technology on the CAD system to make it seem 
<br>
truly, plausible, and until I hear further, I contend we are not even there 
<br>
yet. Secondly, since it hasn't been built or computer-modeled, the upload may 
<br>
not even  provide a convincing sense of personality and memory. 
<br>
<p>Anders is &quot;uploaded&quot; in some fashion into a computer net, and what comes out 
<br>
the other side does not appear to sound or behave like Anders. The jokes or 
<br>
political comments now seem unemotional, the enthusiasm for Extropianism and 
<br>
Transhumanism are completely gone, and to boot, &quot;Anders&quot; now seems to only 
<br>
respond to questions and have none of his own. Eventually, Anders is declared 
<br>
deceased, by his friends and family after several years and a court agrees. 
<br>
What was once Anders, perished that day on the Uploading table!  Soon the 
<br>
Ander program is archived for historians and analsyts. Maybe they can restore 
<br>
him to life once they get the bugs worked out of his Singularity Machine?
<br>
<p>The camera pans right and the Ghost of Rod Serling speaks: &quot;Ladies and 
<br>
gentlemen, submitted for your approval. One Anders Sandburg, a victim in the 
<br>
laudable search for prolonging human consciousness, and giving hope to 
<br>
Billions, now a mere, unaware, data-set in the long, cold, darkness, of The 
<br>
Extropian Zone&quot; (Load, cascading, Trumpet Flourish!&gt; 
<br>
<p>Moral: The technology better be flawless before people hop on the ride. But I 
<br>
guess that was true of the first Roller-Coaster?

<p>&lt;&lt; The idea that some will go on towards Singularity (or whatever) and
<br>
&nbsp;the rest will remain, is of course one of the main Scary Arguments
<br>
&nbsp;Against the Singularity (cf. Stuart Brand, _The Clock of the Long Now_
<br>
&nbsp;and Jaron Lanier's edge piece). Exponential growth might also imply
<br>
&nbsp;exponential growth of differences, and this is generally viewed as a
<br>
&nbsp;bad thing. After lecturing some first year students on waguely
<br>
&nbsp;transhumanism related stuff, I noticed this was one of the arguments
<br>
&nbsp;against it that seemed to work best. Well worth considering.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;The problem is relevant not just for the Singularity but any knowledge
<br>
&nbsp;economy: if there are no strong rules against changing social class,
<br>
&nbsp;but doing so depends merely on an act of will/ambition/ability, the
<br>
&nbsp;resulting situation will still have some who due to their own values,
<br>
&nbsp;passivity, culture or whatever remain down. The door is open, but they
<br>
&nbsp;either think it is closed, to hard to get past or that remaining is
<br>
&nbsp;good. The problem with this division is that it cannot be redressed
<br>
&nbsp;using traditional means like redistributing money or rights, but would
<br>
&nbsp;need some ways of redistributing or improving ambition (the later
<br>
&nbsp;might actually be doable, by creating a more practically optimist
<br>
&nbsp;social atmosphere). And even then we would have the people who do not
<br>
&nbsp;wish to rise to the heavens.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Ethically, I would say transhumanism values diversity and individual
<br>
&nbsp;development. But it is not based on some narrow definition of linear
<br>
&nbsp;progress - we are a bit too postmodern for that - so what kind of
<br>
&nbsp;individual development is desirable is in the end up to the individual
<br>
&nbsp;to make a decision about. A bit like the subjective optimality
<br>
&nbsp;definition of health in Freita's _Nanomedicine_. Now, as I see this,
<br>
&nbsp;when applied to the incomplete singularity scenario, this leads to the
<br>
&nbsp;conclusion that it is completely OK to decide not to join in due to
<br>
&nbsp;one's value system. In fact, it increases the diversity of
<br>
&nbsp;humanity. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;What might happen is of course that the posthumans (or people of the
<br>
&nbsp;new economy or whatever) want to make sure people staying behind do
<br>
&nbsp;this due to their own values as a rational decision, rather than just
<br>
&nbsp;due to mistaken information, habit or something else. Hence they will
<br>
&nbsp;want to give an unbiased image of what they are missing out on (here I
<br>
&nbsp;will just assume ethical posthumans; posthumans with an ideological
<br>
&nbsp;axe to grind is another matter of course). Education becomes very
<br>
&nbsp;relevant.
