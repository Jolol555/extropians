<p>It looks like &quot;white powder gold&quot; with the attributes described by Hudson,
<br>
doesn't (theoretically) exist.

<p>Too bad it costs so much to try to repeat (or falsify) Hudson's experiment. The
<br>
most bizarre part of the Hudson claim is what he (and others) says about
<br>
ingesting the &quot;white powder gold.&quot;
<br>
They claim that eating wpg heightens awareness, bestows psychic abilities (the
<br>
ability &quot;to control human consent&quot;), and prolongs life. White powder gold
<br>
therefore qualifies as a New Age miracle sacrament or witches brew, depending on
<br>
which side of religiosity one takes. I suppose too many people with more money
<br>
than sense will buy into this fantasy because it promises enormous benefits and
<br>
powers. In contrast, all you get for debunking the silliness is bragging rights.
<br>
(And the thanks of inquiring minds.) Thanks.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Monatomic gold is not special either, as is seen from this excerpt from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; www.webelements.com:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;It would not normally be necessary to make gold in the laboratory as it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; readily available  commercially. The most romantic way to extract gold is by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; panning it out from a stream in some  pleasant valley but most such sources
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; now depleted. Panning relies upon the density of gold  (which is very high)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being much greater than that of the sand and other particulates. It therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; settles to the bottom of the pan.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today, more often than not, gold is extracted from ores. These ores often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contain relatively little gold. Some of these processes cause environmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concern. The ore is crushed to a powder so as to expose the small gold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particles. These are dissolved by treatment of the rock with cyanide solution
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; air. The result of this is a gold cyanide complex. Addition of zinc powder to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the resulting solution precipitates out the gold.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    4Au + 8NaCN + O2 + 2H2O  4Na[Au(CN)2] + 4NaOH
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    2Na[Au(CN)2] + Zn  2NaCN + Zn(CN)2 + Au (s)
