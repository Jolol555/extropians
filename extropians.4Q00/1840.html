Another part of the paper that I disagree with is sections 4.2 and 4.3,
<br>
on procrastination and addiction.
<br>
<p>In procrastination, we put off an unpleasant experience.  Later we wish
<br>
that we had done it sooner.  In addiction, we cause a pleasant experience
<br>
which will have unpleasant consequences in the future.  At that time we
<br>
regret our earlier choice.
<br>
<p>Obviously both of these phenomena have to do with how we make and evaluate
<br>
choices over time.  However, as I mentioned earlier with reference to
<br>
another part of the paper, discounting as typically understood cannot
<br>
be considered to play a significant role in these phenomena.
<br>
<p>The problem is simply that the time frame is too short for the kinds of
<br>
discount rates which I have seen suggested to play a significant part.
<br>
Typical discount rates are proposed to be on the order of a few percent
<br>
per YEAR.  Yet with procrastination we are usually putting off an
<br>
unpleasant event by days or weeks at most.  And with addiction, the
<br>
unpleasant consequence comes within days or even hours.
<br>
<p>None of the models I have seen would give a reasonable explanation of
<br>
addiction in terms of discounting, when the time span between pleasure
<br>
and pain is only a few hours.
<br>
<p>Now, you could probably come up with a model that would work for this,
<br>
but it would not involve exponential discounting.  You might have a sort
<br>
of a quasi delta function, where the present weighs extremely heavily,
<br>
and events just a few hours away are heavily discounted, with the rate
<br>
of additional discounting tapering off as we get farther away from the
<br>
present.  However I think this model would be inconsistent with results
<br>
from economic experiments which show more moderate discount rates.
<br>
<p>My conclusion is that our perception of time, and the impacts our choices
<br>
make over time, is complex.  Phenomena like addiction and procrastination
<br>
really don't fit into the simplistic model offered by the authors.
<br>
Rather, they show that the actual situation is much more complicated.
