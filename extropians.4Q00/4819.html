I was thinking about qualia - wondering what would happen if my brain were 
<br>
suddenly receiving inputs about other wavelengths of light besides those in 
<br>
the visible range, x-rays suppose - would I immediately associate novel 
<br>
colors with them, or it would take some time to learn? I realized that since 
<br>
I have (at least) red/green color blindness I may get to find out sooner 
<br>
then normal, since a treatment for color blindness will probably be 
<br>
developed before x-ray vision. I was curious how serious my color blindness 
<br>
actually was - so far in 23 years I haven't really had much difficulty with 
<br>
it. So I looked up &quot;color blindness&quot; and found this page among others:
<br>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/8833/coloreye.html">http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/8833/coloreye.html</a>
<br>
It has a chart on it, and I was startled to find that I can pass only one of 
<br>
the six tests with no difficulty. Three more of them, I can sort-of discern 
<br>
some difference in color around the center..
<br>
Does anyone know if there is any work being done in treatment of color 
<br>
blindness? I would suspect it's more advanced then anything going on today 
<br>
since they'd need to implant cones and rods in the eye, or make them grow 
<br>
there. Any ideas on how to even come up with a treatment?
<br>
Finding out my deficiency was so serious is a great feeling. It means when I 
<br>
fix it, it'll be a whole new world of experience.
