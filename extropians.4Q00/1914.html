Eli asks:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Suppose Person A wants to open up a bar, and applies for a liquor
</em><br>
license. Persons B, consisting of the resident/owners of a nearby
<br>
condominium complex, are annoyed by this for the standard reasons
<br>
- increased noise, increased traffic, violent drunks wandering
<br>
around, and decreased property values. Suppose that Persons B
<br>
sign a petition to deny a liquor license to Person A, thus annoying
<br>
Person A and any investors thereof. Do you agree or disagree
<br>
with the following statements?&lt;
<br>
<p>A &amp; B: no.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;(C) The city government deciding the issue is the nearest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;available approximation to the dispute resolution mechanisms
</em><br>
that would exist in a libertarian society - for example, distributed
<br>
ownership of &quot;noise rights&quot;. 
<br>
<p>I’ll answer Eli’s query as a deep-foggy rather than an old-timer,
<br>
(while remembering that it is size that matters, not age.)
<br>
<p>If I understand the setup correctly, the folks who live in condos
<br>
are complaining that the bar will be too noisy and the issue
<br>
is how to they resolve the impending conflict. 
<br>
<p>As a former homeowner, I remember attending town meetings and
<br>
listening the wranglings night after night.  I purchased a home
<br>
in a commercial zone which was primarily residential, all resident
<br>
knew before purchasing their homes that this location would,
<br>
at some point, be developed.  I was there to turn my home into
<br>
be a business that would have live music.  The fact that people
<br>
lived in homes next to me was secondary to the fact that we were
<br>
commercially zoned.
<br>
<p>The bottom line is this: If you purchase a piece of property
<br>
in close proximity to a business district, the community will
<br>
end up dealing with how much revenue will come from the business
<br>
and how much the town needs the business and who does or will
<br>
work for the business.  If the personality profile of the town
<br>
is rowdy, rowdy will win.  It is a conservative or spiritual
<br>
community, then not too many folks will end up stooped at the
<br>
bar.
<br>
<p>The folks that purchase homes or condos near commercially zoned
<br>
areas have to deal with the consequence development and growth.
<br>
Zoning laws may have community buffer zones which give residence
<br>
a sort of padding between their homes and bustling businesses.
<br>
&nbsp;There are also zoning variances and ordinances.
<br>
<p>If a person purchases a condominium or home which is near the
<br>
buffer zone or right smack up next to a commercial zone, then
<br>
this is part of the possible situations that can occur.  If the
<br>
person does not want to be near a bar, then she or he needs to
<br>
purchase a homestead near a national forest which cannot be developed.
<br>
&nbsp;A commercially zoned location is zoned to the businesses that
<br>
the community desires regardless of who lives next door.
<br>
<p>Regarding noise, I believe in the 1970s Congress passed a Noise
<br>
Control Act as a sort of template for local and state bodies
<br>
to use when designing their own regulations.  However, even my
<br>
townhouse manager where we live doesn’t stop the noise pollution
<br>
coming from the people across the way.
<br>
<p>It seems that the resolution could be obtained through voluntary
<br>
cooperation.  In that the idea is for the individuals involved
<br>
to have the power to decide, rather than a governing body, it
<br>
still boils down to a set of values or guidelines that folks
<br>
will have to follow.  So, if the community wants more business,
<br>
business will win.  If the community wants more spas and meditation,
<br>
there will be a juice bar instead of martinis.
