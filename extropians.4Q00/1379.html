</em><br>
<p>What is interesting, is that if you look at this page, at the bottom:
<br>
<a href="http://www.math.psu.edu/PSUmathhome/courses/maserick/circle/circleapplet.html">http://www.math.psu.edu/PSUmathhome/courses/maserick/circle/circleapplet.html</a>
<br>
<p>You will see a nice handy java applet to calculate pi via the pie slice method.
<br>
When you calculate pie to an accuracy of 12 pie slices, pi equals 2.999999999
<br>
(i.e. just about exactly 3). Its only when you get up between 256 and 512 pie
<br>
slices do you reach four decimal places of accuracy at 3.1415.., and around 4096
<br>
slices to reach 3.14159, and 32768 slices to reach 3.1415926.
<br>
<p>Now, most numbers used in the bible tended to run in a range between three and a
<br>
hundred, with numbers like ten, twelve, etc being prominent. Numbers like 666
<br>
were considered 'really big numbers'. I suppose you could say that the bible was
<br>
meant to be understood by laymen, not as highly complex texts, and as such would
<br>
have been written in the form of 'see spot run' as far as mathematical
<br>
complexity was concerned, so using just 12 pie slices to calculate pie seems to
<br>
fit. If we are to take it as such, then we should also treat it as the vague,
<br>
inaccurate, and detail avoiding text it is, and not something for highly
<br>
technological individuals to use to help run their very complex lives. Fine for
<br>
kids, but to be put away with other fairy tale books when one matures into
<br>
transhumanity.
