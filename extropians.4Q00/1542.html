<em>&gt; &gt; But until then, a single observation that intelligent life exists does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not really shed light on the probability that other such life exists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sure it does.  It doesn't shed as much light as TWO observations that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent life exists, but it sheds a helluva lot more than ZERO
</em><br>
<em>&gt;observations that intelligent life exists, which is why it's got a lot more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going for it as a theory than belief in a supernatural creator.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And to come at this from the other direction, if you don't believe that ONE
</em><br>
<em>&gt;observation that intelligent life exists is useful data, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;observation of, for instance, one -other- intelligent life won't help you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out either (towards predicting the existence of additional intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life.)
</em><br>
<p>Oh yes, the second data point would make a helluva difference! The problem 
<br>
with the one data point we have is that because of observational selection 
<br>
effects it doesn't tell us much. No matter how small a fraction of all 
<br>
planets in our infinite universe develop life, we would by necessity find 
<br>
that we originate from one of the exceptional ones that did. So this data 
<br>
point is predicted equally well (i.e. has a conditional probability of one) 
<br>
given any theory that says that intelligent life would develop somewhere. 
<br>
But finding a second source of intelligent life, in our relative vicinity, 
<br>
would dramatically boost the support for those theories which say that 
<br>
intelligent life is common. (My PhD thesis at 
<br>
<a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com/phd">http://www.anthropic-principle.com/phd</a> has more on this and many other 
<br>
related topics.)
<br>
<p>Regarding Hal's comment: While it is true that the mere fact that 
<br>
intelligent life evolved here doesn't give us any useful information, we 
<br>
might know some things about the manner in which it developed that may 
<br>
enable us to draw some interesting conclusions. For example, we can compare 
<br>
the time it actually took for intelligent life to evolve and compare that 
<br>
to the time that was available (an upper bound on which is given by the 
<br>
time when the sun engulfs the earth in about five billion years). This can 
<br>
tell us something about the number of critical steps in our evolutionary 
<br>
past. If there were very many critical steps (defined as successive 
<br>
transitions which were both necessary and highly improbable) then we should 
<br>
have expected to have evolved closer to the cut-off time. Brandon Carter 
<br>
pioneered this line of reasoning (which is also summarized in my thesis). 
<br>
We can also look at our evolutionary record and try to identify plausible 
<br>
candidates for critical steps. For example, the step from prokaryotic to 
<br>
eukaryotic life seems to have been very difficult. By contrast, the 
<br>
evolution of humanoid apes into humans does not seem to have been very 
<br>
difficult, because it happened very quickly. The bottom line, however, is 
<br>
that the present poverty of empirical data makes it difficult to say 
<br>
anything conclusive about these things, except that all the evidence we 
<br>
have is perfectly consistent with the hypothesis that it is extremely 
<br>
difficult for intelligent life to evolve. This is also consistent with (and 
<br>
in my opinion is the most probable explanation of) the absence of any signs 
<br>
of extraterrestrial intelligence (the Fermi paradox).
