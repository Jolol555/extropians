<p>Rather, 'pseudo-free'. The student pays tuition (or in more socialize
<br>
states, pays taxes on higher income later on to pay back subsidies), and
<br>
the service is a benefit of the education package paid for. Military
<br>
personnel were employees, and their employer paid for them. TANSTAAFL,
<br>
Harvey. I don't pay for the desk I am sitting at, the PC I am using, or
<br>
the internet service I am currently using. Its paid for by my employer
<br>
(or rather, in my case, my customer).
