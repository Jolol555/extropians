What we actually need is to remove every single law that contradicts the
<br>
Bill of Rights.  The DEA has been a disaster of major proportions largely
<br>
because it ignores people's right to make their own decisions about what
<br>
they ingest and in the process has fueled unconstitutional search and
<br>
seizure, detention of citizens, and so on.  Everything you own can be
<br>
seized by the government and sold off before you ever get to trial if
<br>
someone claims you traffic in drugs (in some states if they even claim
<br>
you are a user).  Black-clad unidentified goons can kick open your door
<br>
in the middle of the night without identifying themselves much less
<br>
presenting a warrant.  There have been people killed for attempting to
<br>
defend their homes and loved ones against such interlopers.  The IRS has
<br>
been known to seize entire estates over the smallest sums in dispute.
<br>
This country where the government is supposedly the protector of
<br>
individual rights has become instead a tyrant that its own citizens
<br>
fear.  As well they should when such things as these take place and are
<br>
sanctioned.  This country, land of the free, has more of its people in
<br>
jail per capita than any other.   Something is obviously badly wrong.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Civil disobedience is one way to fight.  Ignoring laws and not making
<br>
oneself a target is another.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everyone thinks some law or other is absurd, is the general solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for everyone to just ignore the ones they don't like?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is actually essential.  If you learned and obeyed the letter of every
<br>
law that binds you you would have little time for anything else and would
<br>
not be able to do very much in what time you had left.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does the existence of factions ignoring sets of laws really reduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the size and power of government, or just its effectiveness?  Look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the War on Drugs - many politicians think that in order to solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defiance of drug laws, they need to spend more money on enforcement,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which requires more taxpayer dollars, which increases the size of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government, which increases the power of government, which gives some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other government pinhead the power to attack some other group
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignoring laws, and so on, and so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Open disobedience arguably brought the first prohibition to an end.  I
<br>
recommend that we campaign as hard against the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; as some of
<br>
us campaigned against the Vietnam war so long ago.  In the meantime
<br>
whatever freedoms have been wrongly coopted by the State can only be
<br>
exercised in secrecy or  publicly in civil disobedience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If anything, I think that we need to be zealots about both enforcing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the laws that we have and *drastically* reducing the number of laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that needlessly affect our lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But the many of those laws we already have deny  our rights and thus
<br>
contradict the very basis of government power in this country.  Their
<br>
zealous enforcement is nothing short of tyranny.   You must pick and
<br>
choose and oppose as best you can what is oppressive.
