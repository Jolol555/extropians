<p>I don't know of any physics articles on time machines based on this concept.

But if this could make sense it would only strengthen the basic claim I was

making, which is that helping your past selves is not logically impossible.

<p>You are of course free to invent your own meaning for the term, but the 
<br>
standard
<br>
economist meaning is just a feature of a scenario that causes a market to 
<br>
produce
<br>
worse outcomes, wrt a standard welfare measure, seem otherwise possible.
