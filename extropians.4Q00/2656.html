<em>&gt; None of which means that when the node-machine dies, the personality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construct associated with its functioning could possibly continue
</em><br>
somewhere
<br>
<em>&gt; else, or `merge back into' the cosmic flow, or any other `holistic'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulation. That's just as muddleheaded. Yes, those aspects of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `selves' that echo or implement ordered structures circulating among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals (call those aspects, loosely, `memes' or `standing waves' or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `attractors', whatever) will persist, while slowly or swiftly morphing.
</em><br>
Any
<br>
<em>&gt; impress we as individuals have left upon the discursive fields will remain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a time to impose chaotic influence on other living nodes, but we'll be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toast. Too bad. Keep the dewars chilled and prepare the nanos for node
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revival in due course. Otherwise, the tide's gone out and there's only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drying kelp left on the beach.
</em><br>
<p>Not quite.  You're still viewing your &quot;self&quot; as a self-contained entity, not
<br>
as the totality of existence.  So far, no one has explained why the &quot;self&quot;
<br>
exists- other than in a physicalist manner which really doesn't explain
<br>
anything, because it still doesn't explain the idea of self-in-experience
<br>
(in other words, why am I me and why am I not you... or why am I not aware
<br>
of everything, because I am part of everything).  The only reason we think
<br>
we are self contained is because of the limits of our nerve endings- as
<br>
Wilber pointed out, our consciousness extends much further.  The brain is
<br>
not a machine that exists outside the universe- it is constantly reacting to
<br>
the gravitational effects of countless bodies throughout the universe, and
<br>
ends up being something of a conveyance for thought that takes place as the
<br>
motions of innumerable bodies throughout the universe.
<br>
<p>Will you be self-aware when you die?  No.
<br>
Is there a soul?  No.
<br>
Will we reincarnate? Not in totality- but to some extent, the patterns may
<br>
pass on.
<br>
<p>However, the movements still take place.  The universe goes on, and life
<br>
continues.  The ego is the only thing that has vanished.
