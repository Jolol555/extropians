So we should dump everything at will into our little cage and see what

happens?

<p>Proving that something is safe may be impossible.  But at least looking at

persistent stuff to see what it might do seems only intelligent.  Look before

you leap, yes?

Straw men; none of these is persistent and bioaccumulative.  OTOH, fertilizer
<br>
runoff is a major pollution problem.  Perhaps more thought would have led to
<br>
more stable forms, or requirement of runoff neutralization.  Cars _were_
<br>
subjected to a precautionary principle: early cars had to go very slowly, and
<br>
sometimes behind a guy with a red flag.  And look, dumping lots of lead and
<br>
sulfur into the air wasn't such a hot idea.  Hey, maybe the precautionary rule
<br>
would have prevented a bunch of kids from growing up with lead poisoning.
<br>
<p>And we know more chemistry and ecology than we did then; we're in a better
<br>
position to evaluate before we try.
