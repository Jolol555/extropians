<p><em>&gt; Ah, but is forcing your child to move to Montana with you kidnapping? No? Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have no rights separate from the authority of their parents.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I suppose you could ask for the kid's permission first. If they don't want
<br>
to move, let them stay in Peoria by themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have no trouble with preventing teachers from forcing students to behave. I
</em><br>
do
<br>
<em>&gt; have trouble with not permitting teachers to expel troublesome students who
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; violating the rights of everyone else to teach or be educated. When a parent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enrolls their child in school, they must accept responsibility for the
</em><br>
behavior
<br>
<em>&gt; of their child, or else give the school the authority commensurate with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility they are being asked to assume.
</em><br>
<p>I'll go along with that. We may not have the right to tell kids what to do, but
<br>
we have the right to exclude kids from that discipline.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Parents rights ought to end where children's rights begin, IMO.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Funny. And they are?
</em><br>
<p>What they are is left as an exercise for the student. It's where they begin and
<br>
end that's been settled.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a society prevents parents from taking action to prevent their children
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; becoming serial killers, the it is on the head of society, not the parents.
</em><br>
<p>Excellent point. Parents therefore have the responsibility to prevent their
<br>
children becoming serial killers. How do parents do this? I dunno, I killed my
<br>
parents. Just kidding.
<br>
Why ignore that it may have to do with genetics? Serial killers spawn serial
<br>
killers (serially, I suppose).
<br>
<p>Instead of focusing on how to prevent sociopathology, why not focus on how to
<br>
instill a longing for enlightenment in children? IOW, instead of asking how to
<br>
prevent sick kids, why not emphasize how to create Buddhas?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Starting kids on a regimen from infancy does wonders for their emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stability (it works with pets too). Try feeding your pet from puppyhood at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exact time every day. They do get to know when they are supposed to be fed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't do so, and they will want to eat at any time, and are far more
</em><br>
bothersome
<br>
<em>&gt; on a consistent basis.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like you've got a very good understanding of this aspect of parenting.
<br>
These days it seems like mostly kids are having kids. Perhaps their parents
<br>
should have taught them more about the advantages of masturbation. (Where's
<br>
Joyclyn Elders when you really need her?)
<br>
<p>&quot;It's not what you know that counts, but who you know.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if you can pay for it.
</em><br>
<p>Don't worry, I won't charge you anything for knowing me.
<br>
&lt;smirk, wink&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, a meritocracy. Something I've often speculated about, but most people tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be of the opinion that a meritocracy is fascistic (mainly because they fear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they themselves will not qualify).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree. Inferior people seek equality. Exceptional people endorse
<br>
meritocracy.
