It's not deja vu.
<br>
It's like I'm reading your posts 30 minutes before I do.
<br>
I think about something to talk about and find someone already wrote it.
<br>
Even posts as personal and individual as introductions
<br>
seem as if I was the one that wrote it.
<br>
Maybe it has something to do with the fact
<br>
that I have neither slept nor eaten much at all for the past two days.
<br>
It's like the world is a mirror.
<br>
Everything I think gets spat back at me.
<br>
Maybe I respect you all so much as my peers
<br>
that my mind registers the words I read as if I were writing them.
<br>
The downside is I don't learn much
<br>
from our highly intellectual conversations
<br>
I just keep getting the same old interesting subjects I've heard before.
<br>
Anybody want to tackle this psychological puzzle?
<br>
<p>Maybe we should talk about something more practical?
<br>
...like how a fatty gel headed sack of seawater can avoid a pinebox?
<br>
Half the &quot;food&quot; in the world is a product of dietary warfare.
<br>
Can you imagine the death toll of a single McDonalds?
<br>
Wheat, Corn = Osteoporosis + Insulin Resistance/Diabetes
<br>
Potato, Squash, Tomato = the same family as DEADLY NIGHTSHADE!?!
<br>
Meat = Antibiotics, pestisides, herbicides (thats anti-bio/pest/herb)
<br>
How many years did you not even know what the real purpose of food was?
<br>
What did you put in your mouth?!?
<br>
<p>I say we burn some poisonous crops to starve the rodents.
<br>
Hunta, Bubonic, and how many more plagues could be fought?
<br>
Hit 2 birds with one stone.
<br>
Pets are, what, a billion dollar burdon on our economy?
<br>
They will not save us.
<br>
They contribute nothing but disease.
<br>
Send all dogs and cats to Austrailia,
<br>
the dogs to kill the frogs
<br>
and the cats to kill the rats.
<br>
The snakes will take them both out afterwards.
<br>
Burn the fields.
<br>
Kills the animals.
<br>
The plague is not coming; the plagues are here already.
<br>
I don't know about you, but I want to survive.
<br>
<p><p>I did not say this, you did not hear this from me. ;-)
