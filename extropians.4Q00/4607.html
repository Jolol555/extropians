<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;At the same time, people's lives are not so different from hundreds of

<em>&gt; I would agree that people's lives are not so different IN A FUNDAMENTAL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SENSE from hundreds of years ago. Fundamental problems remain the same and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental patterns of solution also.
</em><br>
<p>I wonder. What about family structure? We have shifted from the
<br>
agrarian multigenerational family/clan to a much looser structure,
<br>
often just the single mother with single child. Would that count as a
<br>
fundamental change?
<br>
<p>Another issue is mortality. We have definitely moved from the &quot;life is
<br>
cheap&quot; view that was common in the past when it was expected that a
<br>
few of your children would die shortly after birth, and the death of
<br>
family members in illness or violence was a fairly common occurence to
<br>
a situation were deaths are rare but highly emotionally charged.
<br>
<p>Neither of these changes are of course on par with people xoxing or
<br>
becoming immortal, but I would argue they have had quite fundamental
<br>
effects on society, culture and the idea of the human condition.
