<p>It isn't a question of resources, or intelligence, or foresight, or
<br>
compassion.  It is a question of ability to coordinate and commit.
<br>
Consider the analogy of firms trying to collude to raise prices.
<br>
They each have a common interest in so colluding, but also a private
<br>
interest in secretly violating the agreement and selling more at a
<br>
lower price.  Even though firms are smart with great resources, it
<br>
is their inability to coordinate and commit that typically drops
<br>
prices to far below the collusive level.
<br>
<p>If there is just one colonizing agency, then yes, they might assign
<br>
property rights to places to colonize, and take their time about it.
<br>
But if some other &quot;sooners&quot; get out there too, and get out in front
<br>
of the slower standard colonists, then there may not be much the
<br>
official agency can do to stop them or punish them.  By the time the
<br>
colonist &quot;police&quot; arrive, the sooners are off to the next place.
<br>
<p>The key technology that would make a difference would be an ability
<br>
to project force out farther and faster than reproducing colonists
<br>
could move.  But it is hard to imagine such a technology.
