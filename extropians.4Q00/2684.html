PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE
<br>
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
<br>
Number 512 November 15, 2000 by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben
<br>
Stein
<br>
STRANGELETS ARE STRANGE BUT NOT DANGEROUS.
<br>
Strangelets are hypothetical stable or semi-stable particles which
<br>
contain strange quarks. Theorists have predicted that such entities
<br>
could survive for long periods inside neutron stars and might be
<br>
produced in the type of heavy ion collisions going on at the RHIC
<br>
machine at Brookhaven. Fears that the production of strangelets
<br>
would lead to some runaway reaction in which more and more
<br>
ordinary matter would be turned into strange matter, with
<br>
catastrophic effects for our planet, have been largely dispelled (Dar et
<br>
al., Physics Letters B, 16 December 1999; and Jaffe et al., Review of
<br>
Modern Physics, Oct 2000; Select Articles) partly by pointing to the
<br>
fact that nature has always been producing heavy-ion collisions in
<br>
amid cosmic ray interactions. Any remaining doubts over the
<br>
strangelet danger have now been put to rest by Jes Madsen (45-8942-
<br>
3670, <a href="mailto:jesm@ifa.au.dk?Subject=Re:%20PHYS:%20The%20world%20is%20safe%20from%20strangelets&In-Reply-To=&lt;4.3.2.7.2.20001118093129.03d03450@mail.flashcom.net&gt;">jesm@ifa.au.dk</a>) of the University of Aarhus in Denmark.
<br>
Madsen shows that light strangelets are highly unstable, heavy
<br>
strangelets are difficult to make in the fireball environment of the
<br>
collision, and medium-sized strangelets must have a positive charge,
<br>
which precludes (through electrostatic repulsion) their assimilating
<br>
any nearby (similarly positively charged) nuclear matter into a larger
<br>
agglomeration. (Physical Review Letters, 27 November 2000; Select
<br>
Articles.)
