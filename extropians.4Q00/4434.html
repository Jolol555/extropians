<p>That prize is long since taken, Spike.  A few verses seem to be missing

from the version I remember, but here it is:

<p>&quot;When I Was a Boy&quot;
<br>
By Frank Hayes

Copyright © 1997 by Frank Hayes, Firebird Arts &amp; Music (BMI)
<br>
<p>When I was a boy, our Nintendo
<br>
Was carved from an old Apple tree
<br>
And we used garden hose to connect it
<br>
To our steam-powered color tv.
<br>
<p>But it still beat that ancient Atari
<br>
'Cuz I almost went blind, don'tcha know,
<br>
Playing Breakout and Pong on a video game
<br>
Hooked up to the radio.
<br>
<p>And we walked twenty miles to the schoolhouse
<br>
Barefoot, uphill both ways,
<br>
Through blizzards in summer and winter
<br>
Back in the good old days.
<br>
Back when Fortran was not even Three-tran
<br>
And the PC was only a toy
<br>
And we did our computing by gaslight
<br>
When I was a boy.
<br>
<p>When I was a boy all our networks
<br>
Were for hauling in fish from the sea--
<br>
Our baud rate was eight bits an hour,
<br>
And our IP address was just 3.
<br>
<p>And you kids who complain that the World Wide Web
<br>
is too slow, oughtta cut out your bitchin',
<br>
'Cuz when I was a boy every packet
<br>
Was delivered by carrier pigeon
<br>
<p>And we walked twenty miles to the schoolhouse
<br>
Barefoot, uphill both ways,
<br>
Through blizzards in summer and winter
<br>
Back in the good old days.
<br>
Back when Fortran was not even Two-tran
<br>
And the mainframe was only a toy
<br>
And we did our computing by torchlight
<br>
When I was a boy.
<br>
<p>When I was a boy our IS shop
<br>
Built relational tables from wood,
<br>
And we wrappered our data in oilcloth
<br>
To preserve it the best that we could.
<br>
<p>And we carried our bits in a bucket,
<br>
And our mainframe weighed 900 tons,
<br>
And we programmed in ones and in zeros
<br>
And sometimes we ran out of ones.
<br>
<p>And we walked twenty miles to the schoolhouse
<br>
Barefoot, uphill both ways,
<br>
Through blizzards in summer and winter
<br>
Back in the good old days.
<br>
Back when Fortran was not even One-tran
<br>
And the abacus? Only a toy!
<br>
And we did our computing in primordial darkness
<br>
When I was a boy.
<br>
