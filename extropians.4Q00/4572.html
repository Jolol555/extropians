<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; Is it still Thesius's ship? If no, at what point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; was it no longer that ship? When did it lose it's &quot;Thesius's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;ship&quot;-ness?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;It is still Thesius' ship. If you want to know how, observe the workers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;replacing the decayed boards with fresh boards. If you want to know when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;where, pay attention to these details. If you want to know whose ship it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;find Thesius' descendents and heirs. If you want to know why, you're a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;philosopher, and Thesius probably wouldn't want you on the ship.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I disagree totally.  I think the philosphers are asking the exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Is it still Thesius' ship?  There is no right answer.  The label of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Thesius' ship&quot; denotes an ownership relationship that is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;empirically provable.  The concept of ownership is philosophical.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exists, not in reality or by science.  It exists by cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agreement, by legal agreement, by linguistic terminology, or by other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reference systems that we use for interaction between humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In law, for instance, we would have to determine what the contractual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agreement was for the workers to do all this work, and what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agreed to return to Thesius.  In all probability, the rebuilt ship
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was returned to Thesius as his property and the rotting ship was left
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the workers as spare parts.  Can this be empirically measured?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No.  Is there a chemical test we can perform, such as DNA matching,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to see which is Thesius' ship?  No.  The question of nomenclature is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;merely a linguistic reference system that we use for communications.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The question of ownership cannot be measured by science.  It must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;logically deduced by linguists, lawyers, judges, and psychologists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Whatever we end up deciding becomes the right answer.  There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;objective measurable ownership particles that will lead us to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right answer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;--

</em><br>
<p>Yes, you're exactly right about the answer. The reason it is the wrong 
<br>
question though, is because the person giving this talk, when members of the 
<br>
audience made the point that you just made, would respond with something 
<br>
like &quot;yes, but which one is *really* Thesius's ship?&quot;, this is the wrong 
<br>
question but he thought it made sense. He was implicitly subscribing to a 
<br>
belief known as &quot;essentialism&quot;, that there is something about this ship that 
<br>
give it its &quot;Thesius's ship&quot;-ness as an object, something which is seperate 
<br>
from any cultural considerations.
