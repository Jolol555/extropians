Believe me, this was nowhere near the pain of pulling a tooth.  The only 
<br>
person who may need the IV sedation, that I've ever been able to think of, is 
<br>
someone with a needle phobia or a lower-than-average pain tolerance.  I had a 
<br>
lot more pain during a dental cleaning from the cold water than I've ever had 
<br>
with an injection.  I think I have pain tolerance in the average range.  
<br>
(When I &quot;rate&quot; the pain of a particular kind of accident or illness, mine 
<br>
comes up close to that of most people.)   As for the lady with the recurring 
<br>
breast cancer, she sounds depressed.  I don't know why else anyone would be 
<br>
unwilling to better his or her lifestyle at least a little.  I know of 
<br>
someone very overweight, who probably wouldn't be able to give up his diet, 
<br>
but even he takes supplements.
