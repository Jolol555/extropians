Wonderful post, Jeff!
<br>
<p>Don't forget my accessories: my website (linkchecker not included) and
<br>
a big pile of unsorted weird scientific papers. Using a little spring
<br>
they can be launched at evildoers who will be trapped in all the
<br>
hyperlinks and footnotes. 
<br>
<p>Apropos uplifted bacteria, I had a colony of pharao ants living in a
<br>
big stack of transhumanist and scientific papers in my apartment -
<br>
they were likely the best educated ants I have ever met, but they
<br>
apparently left for their own Dyson sphere when winter arrived.
<br>
<p>Sorry for my recent cut-off from the list, this one was due to an
<br>
unexpected and quite nice rash of media appearances. I wrote a piece
<br>
about genetic testing that got me into a debate with the noted author
<br>
P.C. Jersild (whose book &quot;A Living Soul&quot; actually influeced me in
<br>
becoming a transhumanist and neuroscientist) which then led to a radio
<br>
debate and even criticism from the culture section at a major
<br>
newspaper. The text is on the net at www.smedjan.com, but it is in
<br>
Swedish (the radio appearance on P1 is also on the net, but again, in
<br>
Swedish). Anyway, I think we are making headway.
