<em>&gt;  (A) Signing a petition to deny a liquor license is an improper use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government mechanisms, constituting the initiation of force.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;  (D) This is a straightforward conflict of interest between the bar builders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the condo owners, and invoking libertarian ethics is needlessly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicating the issue.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not clear on the above two options. My understanding of the libertarian
<br>
position (if I can be excused for discussing the vast, conflicting body of
<br>
libertarian opinion as one position for a moment) was not that there are no
<br>
conflicts of interest and therefore initiation of force is improper, but that
<br>
initiation of force is improper and especially so when interests conflict. So,
<br>
it would seem to me that the second half of option (D) (after the second 'and')
<br>
is a bit weird; if one agrees with the first half of the option's description of
<br>
the problem, then &quot;libertarian ethics&quot; help to simplify the issue, not
<br>
complicate it.
<br>
<p>As it so happens, this last is my position. I agree with the first half of (D)
<br>
(before the second 'and') and the entirety of (A) (with the possible exception
<br>
of the last five words, which I could quite happily live without). And I think I
<br>
would also hold this position from the perspective of the bar owner, the condo
<br>
owner, and a third-party; the issue of precedence  and legitimacy is of the
<br>
utmost importance and regardless of the benefit the condo owner may gain from
<br>
the closing of the bar, empowering and/or encouraging a government like this is
<br>
dangerous.
