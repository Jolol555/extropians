<p>At the London School of Economics, where I was before, the faculty was fond

of pointing out to profit-oriented masters students that George Soros once 
<br>
studied there for Karl Popper. So now you know why he became a billionaire! 
<br>
Behind every rich man, there's gotta be a philosopher lurking somewhere.

You see, it's not that we don't know how to make tons of money; we just 
<br>
can't be bothered. ;-)

<p><em>&gt;  I just mean that these are things you do not really need formal

</em><br>
<p>Learning philosophy is mainly about learning careful, critical thinking, 
<br>
and the interactive element is critical for that. Learning art history is 
<br>
to a large extent to learn to identify, interpret and put into context 
<br>
various art-historical artifacts, and the good way of doing that is by 
<br>
walking around in museums etc. in a small group with your teacher and 
<br>
discuss what you see. - You need feedback on your performance in order to 
<br>
learn well, and it is easier to get feedback during self-study when you do 
<br>
something like math or physics (where the correct answers are often 
<br>
provided at the end of the book) than when you study one of the humanities.
