<p>Since my home state has become an unwilling subject of
<br>
media scrutiny, I suggest extropians take a vacation down
<br>
there some time.  If you do, you may find that Palm Beach
<br>
County is an anomaly in itself.  It is a huuuuge retirement
<br>
community.  I dont have statistics handy but I suspect the
<br>
average age in Palm Beach County is probably
<br>
the highest in the state, perhaps among the highest in the
<br>
nation.  Anyone have the numbers?
<br>
<p>If you do vacation in Florida, go do the Disney World/
<br>
EPCOT thing if you must, then drive across the BeeLine
<br>
and hit Interstate 95.  Drive south.  You will pass thru
<br>
countless acres of &quot;wetlands&quot;, which is a greeny euphemism
<br>
for vermin infested swamp.  At one time, most of Florida
<br>
consisted of these vermin infested swamps, but in the last
<br>
century, much of that land was drained, much to the
<br>
harm of the wetlands creatures, such as disease-carrying
<br>
mosquitoes and venomous snakes.  Many of these vile pests
<br>
have now been identified as endangered species.  If you happen
<br>
to own a vermin infested swamp and you try to drain it,
<br>
good chance you will be thrown into prison, and for your
<br>
trouble you will be forced to spend untold money to defeat
<br>
the drainage and restore the habitat for the disease carrying
<br>
vermin.  Then of course if trespassers on your swamp fall
<br>
victim to one of these wretched menaces, you are liable.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, this has become a blank check for the greens.
<br>
As far as I can tell, there is no real limit to how far the
<br>
litigants can carry the endangered species act.  It has
<br>
already been successfully used to protect insects.  Bugs,
<br>
fer cryin out loud!  Dont we have enough of these?
<br>
<p>Political campaigns are often reduced to sound bytes.
<br>
Algore manged to get Bush's sound byte to be:
<br>
Bush = end of social security checks and subsequent
<br>
starvation for seniors, etc.
<br>
<p>Perhaps in Palm Beach County the sound byte was
<br>
Nader = fewer golf courses, more vermin infested swamp.
<br>
Consequently he got few votes, making the Buchanan
<br>
vote {sound byte: Buchanan = standing up for god and
<br>
country} seem anomalously high by comparison.  My
<br>
conclusion is that Nader and Buchanan should not be
<br>
legitimately compared, and that doing so in a county
<br>
where there is strong anti-Naderism will make Buchanan
<br>
appear anomalously favored.  Better to simply compare
<br>
the Buchanan vote in each county, compare the Nader
<br>
vote in each county, etc.  Please forgive my lengthy
<br>
epistle.  {8-]  spike
