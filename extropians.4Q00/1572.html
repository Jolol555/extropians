</em><br>
<p>Let me take a shot at this.
<br>
<p>First, some assumptions: two expansion conditions: (1) Into an empty 
<br>
universe and (2) into a universe occupied by beings of various levels 
<br>
of intelligence.  Second, the agents of expansion aren't 'wet' biological 
<br>
(ie they are 'machine' intelligence), and they can and do evolve.  Third, 
<br>
the agents start out competitive, but not maximally nasty.
<br>
<p>Let us then adopt the premise that some of the spectrum of types that evolve 
<br>
become both fast and nasty.  
<br>
<p>I hope you will accept that survival is the single most powerful
<br>
characteristic 
<br>
of a Darwinian regime.  
<br>
<p>Since nastiness is a threat to survival--if you're on the receiving end 
<br>
of it--then speed to run away from nastiness--faster than nastiness can 
<br>
catch you--is definitely going to be selected for.  Thus the leading wave 
<br>
will be strongly selected for faster than the nastiness on its heels.
<br>
Also, since any strain of nastiness will first evolve in a specific location, 
<br>
and then disperse in a forward fan, light speed messages will provide 
<br>
advanced warning beyond the spread of the threat, allowing the threatened 
<br>
to alter course, acquire allies, and develop defenses.  Thus nastiness will 
<br>
always be hemmed in by a greater number of unsympathetic if not hostile 
<br>
forces. Nastiness will always have to devote resources to overcoming 
<br>
opposition--nasty can't be nasty without someone to be nasty to--and will 
<br>
therefor always be back in the pack. And while one might argue that, in 
<br>
order to overcome nastiness, its victims must inevitably become nastier,
<br>
there 
<br>
is clearly another way:  force of numbers.  Force of numbers increases with 
<br>
cooperation and the inclination to refrain from nastiness.
<br>
<p>Inevitably the nasty get squelched , the wave slows down, and becomes nice.
<br>
<p>In an already populated universe, the situation is even more unforgiving of 
<br>
nastiness.  Ahead of the wave are folks with substantially greater resources, 
<br>
possibly higher tech, motivations to employ them in defense--turf they call 
<br>
home and may be disinclined to give up; perhaps neighbors who, themselves 
<br>
threatened, will be even more inclined (than they were without the threat) to 
<br>
band together, and all of whom will be warned ahead of time, by messages 
<br>
broadcast at light speed.  In a populated universe therefor, the expansion
<br>
wave 
<br>
will be slower, because unless it is friendly, it will be an invasion wave,
<br>
and 
<br>
to have any degree of success it will have to bring substantial offensive 
<br>
resources along with it.  Those fleeing it will be way faster.  
<br>
<p>It seems unrealistic that such an invasion force would be composed of
<br>
evolving 
<br>
replicators--the seeds of its own destruction, fleeing before it, and
<br>
broadcasting 
<br>
a warning.  More likely, it would be monocultural and minimally-evolving, a 
<br>
slow wavefront acquiring and securing territory, giving time for those
<br>
ahead to 
<br>
create a defensible boundary.  This is a more conventional scenario in
<br>
which the 
<br>
invaders slow down and then stop and either get nice or get conquered.  
<br>
