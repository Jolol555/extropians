<p>&lt;&lt; How's this for full sentences:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;I was trying to figure out the blast and radiation effects of a
<br>
&nbsp;hypothetical 10-20t yield 2kg (total mass, not pit mass) Californium
<br>
&nbsp;baby nuke just the other day, and I found out that the published
<br>
&nbsp;official software models poop out at 0.1 kiloton. What a pity. I wonder
<br>
&nbsp;if I should file a FOIA request on the Davy Crockett effects
<br>
&nbsp;information--they must have test shot info on at least one of those
<br>
&nbsp;puppies, since they were actually fielded for a while. That ought to get
<br>
&nbsp;me on *somebody's* list, if I'm not already. :) I nosed around a bunch
<br>
&nbsp;on the 'net, too. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;*Why* was I doing this? I was trying to figure out just how dead some
<br>
&nbsp;characters in the movie version of _Starship Troopers_ ought to be. We
<br>
&nbsp;hard-SF readers are a funny bunch.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Btw, for any who didn't know, SSBN is also the designation for the US
<br>
&nbsp;Navy's fleet ballistic missile submarines.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Go Echelon! Beat Constitution!
<br>

<br>
My guess is you left out the phrase anthrax--a teriffic rock group. Also 
<br>
bio-engineered Botulinus Clostridium.  I was remembering that there is the 
<br>
explosive effects of Californium, but I can't remember whether its 
<br>
Californium-54, 94, or 254?
<br>
Dr. Freeh has a bad haircut! Can we use Californium to make better fission 
<br>
reactors? 
<br>
Is Californium a safer fuel to use? Is it potent enuf -perhaps thermionic 
<br>
conversion?
