<p>In spite of the fact that I believe that safety in this area is intrinsically self

contradictory, I would be willing to work on this (like, what other choice is

there?).  Sometimes the greatest inventions are ones that the inventor,
<br>
him/herself, did not think were possible at the outset.  I am interested to know
<br>
who else out there is also willing to beat his/her head against this brick wall?
