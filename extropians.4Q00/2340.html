<em>&gt; No; Buchanan and Nader voters are two very distinct groups

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Buchanan's supporters are mostly conservative and rural

</em><br>
<em>&gt; graph I've seen several times shows that Buchanan's vote

</em><br>
<p>I acknowledge the perception and I disagree that this is a
<br>
legitimate means of comparing candidates.  I calculate thus:
<br>
if a county were to have some *special reason* to have
<br>
strong negative feelings towards one of the non-mainstream
<br>
candidates, then the other non-mainstream candidates, to
<br>
whom the county had no special antipathy, would appear
<br>
to be anomalously favored.  Palm Beach had a special reason
<br>
to have heartburn with Nader: his green stance doesnt play
<br>
well in those parts.
<br>
<p>The URL gives the formulas used to determine the 15 sigma
<br>
result, and it basically looks at the ratio of non-mainstream
<br>
candidate votes.  This approach does not take into account the
<br>
anti-Nader fervor in the county, which I would expect to be
<br>
very strong, with so large a retired population.  I expect that
<br>
generation will not look favorably on a candidate that
<br>
wishes to spend buttloads of money to create habitats for
<br>
mosquitos.
<br>
<p>Note that I am not arguing that some voters mistakenly
<br>
cast the wrong vote, I imagine a few did that.  But looking
<br>
at the Nader votes is the wrong way to determine it.  spike
