<p>Johnny can read playboy.com for all I care.  In fact, my guess is that the

reading of online pornography by minors is a positive force in society. 
<br>
Certainly, minors reading Extropians are a positive force in society. 
<br>
Therefore, I'm saying we should help Johnny keep his secrets.

<p>Yes, that's *why* online pornography is a positive social force.

<em>&gt; Oh OK, well, there's Christians in my family, and I am reading the list, is

</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p>I remember being a bit nervous about that, since my family was Orthodox Jewish
<br>
(and I wasn't, AND they didn't know) - but that's the sort of thing that can
<br>
probably be explained.  You can probably get away with saying:  &quot;I'm not
<br>
reading that part,&quot; or &quot;I disagree with them about that part,&quot; even if it's an
<br>
outright lie.  I haven't seen any newspaper articles warning parents about
<br>
their children coming into contact with online atheism.
<br>
<p>You're a bit out of touch with Mom Logic, aren't you?
<br>
<p>But that's not the real reason - keeping &quot;atheism&quot; out of the subject lines
<br>
would be a major and unusual inconvenience and it really would border on
<br>
Family Correctness, like trying to keep message bodies clean.  Keeping the
<br>
subject lines PG-13 is just ordinary netiquette, if you ask me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And also: a MAJor faux pas HERE:  there's nothing pornographic about Gayness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or having sex to stay young.
</em><br>
<p>Of course there isn't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we put something like &quot;Teen Fuck Blowjobs&quot; - sure, OK, I'd agree -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise, if you are grown up enough to handle the topics here you can also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a grown up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and deal with  it in the subject line
</em><br>
<p>Of course you can...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - and be honest with your parents if
</em><br>

<p>...but *this* idea - Nadia, what planet did you grow up on?
