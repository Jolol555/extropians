<p>Yeah, I agree he's a crazy guy, but that doesn't mean all his ideas are
<br>
worthless, does it?
<br>
I started to include some other more &quot;mainstream&quot; shape changing,
<br>
modular, etc. robot sites just to show that the idea is being worked on
<br>
by people who are not &quot;loons&quot; but I figured everyone knew that already. 
<br>
JM's ideas for agriculture make a great deal more sense to me than eating
<br>
poisoned food.
