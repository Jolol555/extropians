As someone else (Hal, I think) pointed out, they could say the same about you.
<br>
One of the libertarian's favorite slogans is &quot;taxation is theft&quot;, but the
<br>
counter is &quot;property is theft&quot;. Who's right? Depends on your values, actually.
<br>
If you think property rights are the basis of civilization, you'd say the
<br>
former. If you think private property is the basis for hierarchical enslavement
<br>
of the masses, you'd say the latter. By what standard is anything judged? My
<br>
standards aren't accepted by everyone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Simple.  They want to not only make their own mind up but having decided
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that X is good they would like to force my compliance at gunpoint.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have no intention of forcing them to do anything at all.  If we have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;logic in common then I guess little more than self-defense of one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;person and space or avoidance of one another would be left.
</em><br>
<p>Smart-ass. But, that's meant in a good way, actually.
<br>
<em>&gt;Ah, I forgot, there I go again, using logic.
</em><br>
<p>I'd say yes, it does mean someone must sacrifice themselves for this guy.
<br>
However, you use the word enslave. You are re-defining a common word, and
<br>
attempting to substitute that altered definition into the conversation as though
<br>
it were the original, common meaning. The word slavery (in common usage) does
<br>
NOT denote being required to do some sort of service for others. This is one of
<br>
the weakest parts of any libertarian arguments, the failure to make an argument
<br>
using commonly accepted definitions. Of course people think slavery is bad. But
<br>
they also don't think requiring people to 'give back' is slavery. And this is
<br>
where we lose people who could potentially help us. (Before you ask, I
<br>
personally would say he is asking for something to which he has no right, though
<br>
I don't know that I'd consciously call it slavery.)
<br>
<em>&gt;Someone to take care of them?  Doesn't that translate to this guy saying he has
</em><br>
the right to enslave others for his benefit?  If &gt;so then why should any decent
<br>
people take such a statement seriously?   In fact increased freedom has done
<br>
more to &gt;increase the well-being of all elements of society than any amount of
<br>
chaining the more able to the needs of the less able.
<br>
<p>I think the problem is cross purposes. You're arguing against what (I think) you
<br>
think I'm saying, that government is ok, etc. What I'm doing, though, is saying
<br>
there are people who don't agree with you, and they do wield power. I once saw a
<br>
priest make a very strong chain of logic showing that Christ was God. My point?
<br>
If you buy the basic proposition that God exists, all else falls into place.
<br>
Logic by itself is NOT enough, you have to agree on basic points of reality.
<br>
And, largely libertarians are in a minority on what's right and wrong. We use
<br>
words in ways that others don't (slavery, plunder, etc. ) and then expect them
<br>
to agree with us. They may, for a while, but then they realize we were doing
<br>
something they didn't know, and they not only no longer agree, they think we're
<br>
deceptive, stupid etc. We lose ground. We need to be able to deal with things as
<br>
they are, and move forward.
<br>
<em>&gt;You seem to have studiously missed the point.  I made a statement about what I
</em><br>
think is the best that can be achieved and  &gt;that historically seems best.  You
<br>
claim that I have prejudiced the conversation but you have not shown this. I am
<br>
telling you &gt;what I think and why.  If you disagree then show me why instead of
<br>
forbidding me effectively to have an opinion or apply any &gt;criteria at all
<br>
simply because some (or even most) disagree with me.
<br>
<p>If I seem like I'm yelling, I apologize, that's not what I meant (even to imply
<br>
it). Can you show that something is really an absolute? To my satisfaction? To
<br>
the satisfaction of someone who utterly disagrees with you? For example, is
<br>
death an absolute? Not to a Christian, but to me (an atheist) it is. What is an
<br>
absolute, how do you know, etc. You act as though these question have been
<br>
answered, completely and definitively. I don't think they have. Neither do
<br>
others, and yet others do, but their answers aren't the same as yours.
<br>
<em>&gt;If you want to dissolve yourself in non-absolutism then have at it.  But stop
</em><br>
yelling at me for not joining you.
<br>
<p><p>Look around you. This is already happening (drug laws, police killings of
<br>
citizens, etc.) What happens, that is how much does the populace care? Not much,
<br>
usually. I live in  a city where the police have killed young black men, refused
<br>
to answer questions about what happened, and the people in they city get mad at
<br>
the newspapers for reporting it. (I'm not making this up, I can find the letters
<br>
to the editor.) People aren't always rational, or they don't always fit your
<br>
definition of rational. Still, you get dead, they go on plundering. If we can
<br>
get enough people to accept that this is wrong, it stops. If not, your defensive
<br>
force is meaningless.  (I am not arguing against defensive force, just trying to
<br>
make it unnecessary)
<br>
<em>&gt;Let them value whatever they want.  But if they come to deny me my values with
</em><br>
force then they deserve little but  &gt;self-defensive force in return.
<br>
<p>I don't think that's the issue actually. I have little problem saying what I
<br>
think to be true. I just want a practical way of achieving what we want, mostly.
<br>
<em>&gt;That people get pissed off when you disagree with them and attempt to make a
</em><br>
case for what you think  is a flaw of theirs, &gt;not of yours.  How will you get
<br>
anywhere by not trying to say what you believe and why the best you can?
<br>
<p>If I didn't think ideas had power, would I be discussing this? No, all power is
<br>
not in the mob, but this is a democracy. People ought to be involved in the
<br>
decisions which affect their lives, and we've got to meet them where they are,
<br>
not demand they meet us on our terms. If we continue to do that, they're not
<br>
going to show up at all.
<br>
<em>&gt;If I read you correctly you think all power is in the mob and almost none in
</em><br>
ideas and principles.  Yet that which brought us to &gt;this point grew out of
<br>
ideas and principles being applied to the problems of  government.  Do you see
<br>
change as  &gt;impossible?  What is it that you do propose doing?
