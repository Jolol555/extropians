</em><br>
<p>Gee, I feel bad that you didn't get your money's worth.  You made no
<br>
mention of the set of ExI action figures and the accessories catalog.  Boy,
<br>
if you missed out on that, I can see why you're pissed.  I've enjoyed
<br>
untold hours of good clean fun with mine.  It's highly extropic, and
<br>
educational as well.  Of course I dropped a bundle on the accessories, but
<br>
it was worth every penny of it.  Except maybe the Mike Lorrey accessory
<br>
kit, which I think was a bit much.  I mean the F-16 is pretty cool, with
<br>
the nuclear payload in the weapons bay and all, but an entire aircraft
<br>
carrier to go with it?  Then there's Mike's personal humvee, mechanized
<br>
quad fifty, and nuclear missile silo slash headquarters compound.  If you
<br>
send the Mikey figure down the little elevator and then slide back the
<br>
little blast door on top, you can hear a little recorded action figure
<br>
voice echoing from deep within the silo saying:  &quot;You'll never take me
<br>
alive!&quot; or &quot;There's no such thing as a free lunch!&quot; or &quot;Die, collectivist
<br>
swine!&quot; or other such Mikeyisms.  Totally cool!  And the little Mikey
<br>
figure drops right into the F-16 cockpit.  Then you can fling it across the
<br>
room real neato.  But you have to be careful, cause if the Spike Jones
<br>
figure is out of the box--and this is invariably the case--it will blast
<br>
off from the ground and knock Mikey and F-16 right out of the air. (It will
<br>
do the same thing if you just throw the nuclear payload, or even, in fact,
<br>
if you just throw little Mikey himself!  When something dangerous goes
<br>
ballistic, I guess, the Spikester is just programmed to intercept.)   And I
<br>
don't even want to tell you about Mikey's gun collection.  Very extensive,
<br>
very costly.  But if you buy the whole thing you get a miniature (2&quot; x
<br>
1.25&quot;) complimentary copy of the Bill of Rights with a bullet resistant
<br>
polycarbonate front window and welded titanium frame, the Second Amendment
<br>
engraved around the periphery.  (You have to use a magnifying glass to read
<br>
the tiny lettering.  Way cool.) 
<br>
<p>The Natasha Vita-More action figure is quite beautiful.  Natasha--as I like
<br>
to call her because, well, it's her name--Natasha comes with her own
<br>
extropic pleasure dome and aesthetic-energy nexus (which costs extra).  It
<br>
looks kinda of like a lava lamp only spherical.  When you power it up and
<br>
drop her into what the catalog describes as the &quot;teardrop of Maya&quot; she
<br>
morphs into &quot;a fractal kaliedoscope of shapes, textures, and colors&quot;, &quot;a
<br>
sensuous dance of light and form&quot;,  &quot;an iridescent celebration of a waking
<br>
dream&quot;.  Very beautiful.  When I put it in my green house, all the plants
<br>
turn their leaves to face it and bloom continuously.
<br>
<p>The Anders Sandberg figure is truly remarkable.  One of my favorites.  It's
<br>
some sort of nootropic receiver and amplifier.  Wherever you put it, the
<br>
nearby objects become more, ... er, ... evolved. I put it in my aquarium
<br>
and all the fish grew legs, climbed out of the water, and escaped into the
<br>
greenhouse.  Last I saw they were basking in the glow of Natasha's light
<br>
and throbbing contentedly.  I put it on top of my head and immediately felt
<br>
as if my consciensceness were expanding at light speed out into the
<br>
universe, the experience rapidly exceeding the ability of words to convey
<br>
it.  But it was impossible--for me at least--to sustain the flow of
<br>
nootropic energy.  According to the catalog, some sort of metered-feedback,
<br>
self-limiting feature, a kind of safety cut-off.  Prevents unqualified
<br>
transcends.  I would awaken to find myself in the greenhouse, beneath the
<br>
flowers, basking in Natasha's light, surrounded by lizard-fish, all of us
<br>
throbbing contentedly.  Anders meanwhile, would be over in the corner with
<br>
the Buddha and the Max figure, the three of them surrounded by a halo of
<br>
what I guess to be uplifted and by-now-very-bright microorganisms.
<br>
Luckily, but logically, the 'Anders effect' is always benign.
<br>
<p>The Robert Bradbury figure is quite dynamic. It comes complete with the
<br>
Crown of Bluntness at no extra charge, I suppose because you can't get it
<br>
off no matter how hard you try.  If you do try, be prepared for some sparks
<br>
and a very nasty shock!  In those moments when it seems quiescent, if you
<br>
get down real close and put your ear right up next to it, you can hear in
<br>
miniature--no, more like full size, but at a great distance--the sound of
<br>
vast engines and the rumbling crackle of megajoules of plasma energy
<br>
surging relentlessly.  You jump back in fear and wonder at the impression
<br>
of so much energy in so small a space.  When it goes kenetic it turns into
<br>
a semi-invisible blur, like the wings of a hummingbird.
<br>
<p>On a cold winter's night, I like to arrange all of the action figures in a
<br>
little semicircle in front of the fire--it's in one of those fake gas
<br>
fireplaces.  In place of the regular fake-fire items I put this special
<br>
ceramic model of the washington capitol building and the White House (from
<br>
the catalog; not too expensive).  When I light 'er up, flames come out of
<br>
the little windows and doors.  It's really neat, and all the action figures
<br>
start to sing: &quot;The sun will come up tomorrow.  Bet your bottom
<br>
dollar,...etc&quot;  You know, the song from &quot;Annie&quot;.  It's kinda cute.
<br>
<p>When the set first came there was a message telling me that the Eugene
<br>
Leitel and Robin Hanson figures would be shipped separately.  When that
<br>
package came however, it was empty, and a big hole torn in the side--it
<br>
looked like the box had been burst from inside.  An accompanying message
<br>
said that they had been out of stock of the Robin Hanson units.  I called
<br>
ExI's customer service and they said that the distributor has been told
<br>
repeatedly not to send Eugene out alone.  He get's bored and refuses to
<br>
stay in the box.      
<br>
<p>By far the most impressive, bizarre, and perhaps even dangerous action
<br>
figure is the Eliezer Yudkowsky.  In a pitcher of heavy water, it will
<br>
swell to fill the pitcher, the resulting protoplasmic 'gel' giving off an
<br>
eerie blue glow.  Gradually, if left to stand, the water will evaporate and
<br>
the Eliezer figure will be restored.  But whereas, if you put the other
<br>
action figures in water, in the freezer, they will eventually end up head
<br>
down, frozen in ice, if you attempt this with the Eliezer figure, the blue
<br>
gel will expand, absorbing first the pitcher, then filling the freezer and
<br>
absorbing everything inside; all the other action figures; everything.
<br>
Then, unless you act quickly and shut off the freezer, turn off the gas and
<br>
electric, shut off the heat, and pull down the shades, the blue gel will
<br>
absorb the freezer and a substantial portion of your kitchen as well.  This
<br>
worries me, because, though everything will eventually return to normal,
<br>
all the action figures then give off this slight blue glow.  And while
<br>
everything seems like it's back to normal, nevertheless it also seems
<br>
somehow, ... different.
<br>
<p>I bet what happened to your set was that, since you're in Sweden, the
<br>
packeage was probably opened in customs.  Big mistake.  Extropians, like
<br>
the beasties from the Pandora story, never will go back in the box.  Guess
<br>
you'll just have to come to the US, check out the next conference, and pick
<br>
up another set.
<br>
<p>Worth the trip.
