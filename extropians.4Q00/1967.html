<p>I see.  And if you are successful, where in the heck are you going to run?
<br>
Where are any of us going to run?  Getaway from what?  Where?

<p>OK so you manage to rescue the HWoMBeP from his own monster.
<br>
Shall the rest of us scramble for a computer in which to upload
<br>
or a rocket booster in which to flee the doomed planet?
<br>
<p>{8^D  This is intended as a light-hearted post, but those of you who
<br>
are actively working on AI could perhaps reassure us occasionally that
<br>
everything really is under control down there in Atlanta, yall.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I misunderstood the purpose of the HRV (HWoMBeP
<br>
Rescue Vehicle).  Is it to whisk him away to safety from the Singularity,
<br>
or from the hoards of peasants with pitchforks and torches that have
<br>
gathered outside the castle walls?  spike
