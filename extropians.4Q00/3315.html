<br>
<p>I say that in all seriousness.  I don't expect a plurality of voters 
<br>
to appreciate the logical simplicity and consistency of the 
<br>
Libertarian position as we do.  The best we can hope for is that 
<br>
they'll latch on to some of the natural but superficial side benefits 
<br>
of the Libertarian philosophy.
<br>
<p>In my experience, your average Joe is more interested in those little 
<br>
side issues than he is in maintaining a logically consistent and 
<br>
long-term beneficial political philosophy.
<br>
<p>Ours is a society whose adult populace idolizes professional 
<br>
wrestlers, keeps infomercial pyramid schemes profitable, worships 
<br>
irrational gods, and actually gives a shit about the turn-offs of 
<br>
Miss July.
<br>
<p>I don't have a lot of hope in benefiting from the intelligence of the 
<br>
masses.  The best we can hope for is a coincidence of goals that 
<br>
achieves at least some of what we want.  Maybe, as Libertarian 
<br>
principles gain acceptance, the masses will gain appreciation for how 
<br>
the whole comes together and benefits society, but that feels a bit 
<br>
far removed to be relied upon.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
