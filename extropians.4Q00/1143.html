(sorry for the extra message)
<br>
Actually, I was just thinking about your post, perhaps you are referring to
<br>
the fact, that with Alzheimer's, we do not know if those memories are
<br>
retrievable due to irreparable damage? Hmmm...you may have a point with the
<br>
noted concern. However, I think that this can be thrown into the underlining
<br>
importance of memory research, since this is an issue we will have to
<br>
contend with anyways, if we want to return with our previous selves and
<br>
memory data banks in place. (although I'm not sure all do, I do)
<br>
Emphysema? I imagine once we have gotten to the point of repairing that
<br>
externally of cryo, we could do the same in that situation. Could we do the
<br>
same regarding the synapses traveling that memories route, I don't know, I
<br>
know there are worries, that the freezing itself in cryo could damage this.
