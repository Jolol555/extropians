</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt; Given that drugs like alcohol act to suppress the ego and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; allow the id more liberties (i.e. reduces inhibitions) this is as close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; to a thought crime as I think it is possible to go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; Really, it's not a thought crime at all. She really said it, the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  If this is so, then why is court testimony under the influence of drugss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; deemed inadmissible?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Drugs are assumed to alter perception under the law.  A criminal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altered perceptions still is guilty of a crime, and can still be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prosecuted.  A witness with altered perceptions may not have accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceptions or memory, and thus cannot be relied upon as a witness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't believe there are any specific laws that bar such witnesses,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the opposing counsel would obviously raise the question of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; credibility.
</em><br>
<p>Thats all I wanted to know: &quot;altered perceptions&quot;. It also inhibits ones
<br>
ability to rationally exercise one's fifth amendment rights. While
<br>
irrevocable acts generate a permanent impact (like crashing one's car
<br>
while drunk), speaking one's mind (ones mind that has altered
<br>
perceptions) while drunk is not irrevocable, so permanent responsibility
<br>
cannot be brought to bear. Frankly, any cop who took offense enough to
<br>
consider such an epithet a hate crime I would not want to have on my
<br>
police force. The problem with making speech like this criminal is that
<br>
it turns every domestic violence situation into a hate crime, typically
<br>
by both parties. I don't know if anyone else here has ever ridden along
<br>
with cops before, (or been a party to such a domestic situation) but the
<br>
language that individuals in such situations use is most definitely
<br>
within the realm of the definition of 'hate crime' that was used in the
<br>
case described. Making speech such as this criminal is, in fact, thought
<br>
crime.
