<em>&gt; &gt; remember some crucial things you said about goals/subgoals. Specifically, do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you expect them to be strictly hierarchical, or is it a more general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; network, where if x is a (partial) subgoal of y, y can also be a (partial)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; subgoal of x?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I'm not rightly sure what kind of thinking could lead to this confusion.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Goals and subgoals are thoughts, not source code.  Subgoals, if they exist at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, exist as regularities in plans - that is, certain states of the Universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are reliably useful in achieving the real, desired states.  Since &quot;subgoals&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have no independent desirability - they are only useful way-stations along the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; road to the final state - they can be hierarchical, or networked, or strange
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loops, or arranged in whatever order you like; or rather, whatever order best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mirrors reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Goals and subgoals are logical entities, goal states.  Calling them
<br>
thoughts seems to conflate mechanism, information flow, processing, with
<br>
purpose.  Is this as it should be?  Is a state a thought?  The goal is a
<br>
state is a desired configuration of system/reality.  Thus a goal is not
<br>
a thought.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Certainly, it strikes me that there ought to be multiple &quot;top
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; level&quot; goals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BLEAH!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and they ought to come into conflict;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quintuple bonus BLEAH!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't think that one top level goal do the job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why on Earth not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>A top level goal of Friendliness would get most sentiences with such a
<br>
most important, top or central goal killed.  Friendliness is usually a
<br>
subgoal to things like survival for most living things.  Living things
<br>
are not hand crafted with a top level goal.  We aren't sure whether such
<br>
crafting will take and hold and if it does, whether the result will be
<br>
viable or meet our notions of &quot;friendliness&quot; at all.
