<p>Net software uses genetic algorithms
<br>
By Duncan Graham-Rowe
<br>
VIRUSES are common on the Internet, but now it's the turn of bacteria, says
<br>
British Telecom. But rather than being a menace, the organisms BT has in
<br>
mind have been designed to help make the Net faster. The idea is to mimic
<br>
bacterial sex to &quot;evolve&quot; a more efficient network.
<br>
Ian Marshall at BT's research centre near Martlesham, Suffolk, believes that
<br>
the volume of Internet traffic is growing at an unsustainable rate. &quot;It's
<br>
important that the network is able to adapt continuously,&quot; he says. BT's
<br>
solution is to let it manage itself.
<br>
Rather than having software oversee the entire network, Marshall and his
<br>
colleague Chris Roadknight designed the junctions of a network so that each
<br>
could be run by a piece of autonomous software. Like bacteria, they had no
<br>
central knowledge or overall control, yet Marshall says they were able to
<br>
run the network very efficiently.
<br>
Information sent over the Internet is broken up into discrete packets which
<br>
are stored in a &quot;buffer&quot; memory before being forwarded to the next leg of
<br>
their journey. Ideally, buffers are long. But the more information the
<br>
packets hold, the slower they move. &quot;If a packet arrives at the buffer and
<br>
it is full, then it tends to get thrown away,&quot; says Marshall. This means
<br>
some information will be lost.
<br>
What is needed is the ability for buffers to know what kind of information
<br>
they are passing and adapt their length according to the need. To do this
<br>
using traditional techniques will become impossible as the Internet grows.
<br>
So BT turned to nature in the form of &quot;genetic algorithms&quot;. These are
<br>
biologically inspired programs commonly used to help design--or
<br>
evolve--things that people find difficult.
<br>
GAs mimic natural selection by treating strings of data like genetic
<br>
material. These strings can be combined and mutated to produce offspring
<br>
whose fitness is then evaluated. The best are &quot;bred&quot; to produce more
<br>
offspring. This is repeated until the best design has evolved. The problem
<br>
BT found was that GAs are too slow for real-time applications, since they
<br>
require the evaluation to take place over many generations. So Marshall and
<br>
his colleagues proposed a different biologically inspired solution.
<br>
Bacteria don't have sex in the traditional sense, they reproduce using a
<br>
technique known as plasmid migration. &quot;They wander around and bump into each
<br>
other and say 'hi, do you want some of my genetic material',&quot; explains Inman
<br>
Harvey, an artificial intelligence researcher at the University of Sussex.
<br>
By exchanging plasmids (rings of genetic information) through their cell
<br>
membranes with neighbouring cells, successful genes can pass quickly through
<br>
a colony and allow it to adapt rapidly to its environment. Random mutations
<br>
produce new genes, with successful genes flourishing and ineffective ones
<br>
quickly dying off. In a network these successful genes will enable the
<br>
buffers to be optimised to carry packets of information as efficiently as
<br>
possible. According to Harvey, the technique could open up many
<br>
opportunities.
<br>
&quot;With evolution, traditionally you only reap the benefits after many
<br>
generations, whereas here you have the three aspects of evolution--heredity,
<br>
variety and selection--but without anyone having to die,&quot; he adds.
