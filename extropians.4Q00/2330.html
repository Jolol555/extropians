<p>I like this.  Combine it with Eliezer's idea to let people vote more
<br>
than once (each vote superceding their earlier ones) and you might
<br>
see some interesting effects.
<br>
<p>Now eliminate the fixed time limit, and let the vote be settled once
<br>
there is a consensus, that is, one candidate has had the highest score,
<br>
stably, for some extended period of time.
<br>
<p>This might give you some of the effects of Borda count type systems,
<br>
where you'd end up with a candidate who was acceptable to all even if
<br>
not the first choice of most.
<br>
<p>Or do you think you'd see constant fluctuation?  Like A beats B, B
<br>
beats C, and C beats A, so we constantly cycle through them?  I wonder.
<br>
It would seem kind of stupid for people to get stuck in a cycle like that.
