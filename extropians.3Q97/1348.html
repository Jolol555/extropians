***** Yes. We cannot forget the necessary "cultural treatment". But <br>
consider the following personal example: When I was a catholic (now <br>
I'm a positive atheist and still try to keep a charitous behaviour) I <br>
pertained to a group of helping to poor people called "vincentians", <br>
(in homage to a very charitous "saint" called Vincent). So, as an <br>
engineer, I assessored the construction of small brick houses to the <br>
poors. An interesting case was of a black woman, poorly and dirtly <br>
dressed, with an insane daughter. Her wood house was even difficult <br>
to get into... bad smell of mould and dirty...After her new house got <br>
ready, I once passed in front it and, who have I seen at the <br>
window, happy, bath taken and with still poor but new and clean <br>
cloths? That poor black woman. If that "environmental" (really...) <br>
change made possible such transformation, imagine one that happened <br>
on the nearest enviroment of a person, which it sees at the mirror <br>
when wakes up in the morning... It will help a lot... I suppose that <br>
the physical self-admiration factor is very important, and acts <br>
something recursively (although apparently horizotally asymptotic) in <br>
the psychological evolution of an individual, principally the <br>
women... It is well know that some (white) women even suicide if  <br>
their external beauty get seriously damaged...    <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Chip Delany, BTW, is a black, gay, upper-middle class writer who lives with</i><br>
<i>&gt; a white former street person.  (You can read about him and his fiction and</i><br>
<i>&gt; theories of textuality in my book READING BY STARLIGHT:  POSTMODERN SCIENCE</i><br>
<i>&gt; FICTION.)  His skin is not that dark, and his features would perhaps allow</i><br>
<i>&gt; him to `pass' if he wished to do so.  These days he's pretty hefty and</i><br>
<i>&gt; heroically bearded and wears fearsome tats, and would probably find EvMICK</i><br>
<i>&gt; in all his leather-&amp;-chains-glory *just* the kind of white meat he'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; fancy...  Boo!  (Gotta watch that give-away unconscious, old son, thrum</i><br>
<i>&gt; thrum the gears, screech the brakes.)  </i><br>

About gayness, I'm really heterossexual (politypic, hehehe). But I <br>
suppose there is an interesting psycho-socio-phylosophical <br>
question associated with what you've exposed: What would be the <br>
normal (gaussian) behaviour of the male human if  having  a <br>
functional-chromo-geometric variable body? I really believe that <br>
a great quantity of them would be easily found "in short skirts and <br>
toplessed" (or worse...hahaha).    <br>
