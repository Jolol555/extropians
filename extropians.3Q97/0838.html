Eric Watt Forste responds to Abraham Moses Genen saying:<br>
<i>&gt;Essentially you've informed all of us that you disagree with</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perry, and that's all. Did you relly need to quote every single</i><br>
<i>&gt;line of Perry's post to do that? Do you think that your</i><br>
<i>&gt;informing us that you disagree with Perry did anything to</i><br>
<i>&gt;improve the quality of information being presented to list</i><br>
<i>&gt;subscribers?</i><br>
<p>
I have proven that, given a very weak notion of rationality, mutual<br>
awareness of the mere fact of disagreement is enough to eliminate all<br>
informational sources of disagreement between two agents.  (See:<br>
<a href="http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/calibration.ps">http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/calibration.ps</a>)  Thus if Abraham and<br>
Perry were rational in this sense, Abraham's notice of disagreement<br>
would be extremely informative.<br>
