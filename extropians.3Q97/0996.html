It makes perfect sense to me.<br>

Yes, but are you trying to elicit a positive response here?  Are they<br>
positively reacting to the concept of "optimism based on facts and critical<br>
thinking", or positively reacting to whatever "dynamic optimism" makes them<br>
think of?<br>
<p>
Maybe they're just reacting to the purveyors of the idea, as in Dr. Hanson's<br>
"ideas as clothes" concept.  In that case we could switch to "blmfgh" with no<br>
risk of misunderstanding :-)<br>
