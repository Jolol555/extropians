I'd like to stick to the term "prejudice".  When debating such a theory, I<br>
would definately use the better sounding terms.  But here, among family, I<br>
would like to admit that there are theories that I don't want to spend the<br>
time on, even the time required to evaluate the relative simplicity of the<br>
various arguments.<br>
<p>
I have solid, rational support for my all my scientific prejudices.  but<br>
once I have built up my heuristics (i.e. stereotypes), I want to use them<br>
with as little thought as possible.<br>
