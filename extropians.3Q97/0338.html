Love to help out if I can...but all i can do Is give you my own opinion.<br>
<p>
My education is perhaps similar to yours...(I've got an BS,and an MS but they<br>
were in business...and I feel effectively useless)..and I work for a living<br>
as a Truck Driver.  (owner operator).<br>
<p>
However I since childhood I have been reading Science Fiction....and when I<br>
was experienced enough to understand the difference I concentrated on the<br>
"Hard" variety...<br>
<p>
Check out any books you can find by,..... (remember...this is from memory<br>
only...so some errors are probable)......<br>
<p>
Vernor Vinge, Neal Stephenson, W.T. Quick, James Hogan,John Cramer,Larry<br>
Niven, and several more  but can't remember their names<br>
<p>
Read:<br>
"Engines of Creation" and "Unbounding the Future" by Erick Drexler<br>
"The Lucifer Principle" Howard Bloom<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Use the net...go to websites of the Transhuman Alliance, the millenium<br>
foundation, <br>
Home page of James Hogan, John Cramer, Linda Nagata, <br>
<p>
key words nanotechnology, Augmented Reality, Extropian, ....<br>
<p>
This is but a bare smidgin...hope it helps a little.<br>
<p>
