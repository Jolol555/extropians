<i>&gt; &gt; life. (It would be even worse if it was designed to torture it.)</i><br>

<i>&gt; faith in the innate perversity of the universe.  I shudder to think what would</i><br>

<i>&gt; lawn mower.</i><br>
<p>
I think I know what you mean by "the innate perversity of the <br>
universe", but I can't think of any good way of defining or <br>
explaining it. What would your explication be?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; It will spread with the speed of an bacterial</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; infection, and be quite deadly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Why couldn't it spread much faster? Bacteria are limited to some</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; specifid kinds of hosts, the nanites could attack any organic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; material and many inorganic ones too.And if they were deliberately</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; designed, they could transform themself to missiles after they had</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; eaten enough, and then swoosh accross the seven sees in a very short</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd actually think that the infection would spread in multiple waves.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; first wave might be small pellets travelling at hypersonic speeds, or even</i><br>
<i>&gt; lightspeed computer viruses travelling to existing replicators.  The second</i><br>
<i>&gt; wave would be a softening-up wave that would reproduce very quickly and at</i><br>
<i>&gt; high speed, taking small bites out of things and leaving third-wave</i><br>
<i>&gt; replicators behind.  The third wave would be immensely destructive, the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; gray goo.  The fourth wave, if any, would assemble things out of the raw</i><br>
<i>&gt; material thus produced.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Note that these don't need to be different types of replicator.  Each "wave"</i><br>
<i>&gt; could be a different mode of action, evoked by circumstances.</i><br>
<p>
Yes. It should be possible to model the first two waves <br>
mathematically. You have a roomful of nodes, and one node is the <br>
starting node. The starting node emits colonizers. When a colonizer <br>
arrives at a node, that node begins to emit colonizers too, after a <br>
certain delay time. Each colonizer can be sent to a any node. Which <br>
colonizers do you send to which nodes in order to colonize all nodes <br>
in the shortest possible time?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; hope</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that the nanites weren't deliberately designed to pile up explosives</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; on top of their bunker and blow it all away. --Yes, they *could* make</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it, at least in a Hollywood movie...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree, except that they'll be using nukes, not ordinary explosives.  Or the</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanites could surround the entire compound, lift it into space, and toss it</i><br>
<i>&gt; into the Sun.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe nukes, but that presupposes that they have enough intelligence <br>
to do Uranium mining and to put together a warhead. Chemical <br>
explosives would be easier to have them manufacture if you couldn't <br>
give them superintelligence. --Tossing it into the sun seems a bit <br>
farfetched and unnecessary.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Who will guard the guardians?" - maybe nanotechnology would give us a perfect</i><br>
<i>&gt; lie detector.  Nanotechnology in everyone's hands would be just like giving</i><br>
<i>&gt; every single human a complete set of "launch" buttons for the world's nuclear</i><br>
<i>&gt; weapons.  Like it or not, nanotechnology cannot be widely and freely</i><br>
<i>&gt; distributed or it will end in holocaust.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, yes. At least in the absense of a working immune system, but we <br>
have doubt's that such is possible. Do you have any concrete reason <br>
why it could not work, though?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Nanotechnology will be controlled by</i><br>
<i>&gt; a single entity or a small group... just as nuclear weapons are today.</i><br>
<p>
Right. Though see my Safe Libertarian Future scenario in my reply to <br>
Anders. Would you agree that it would be a stable state? (I don't <br>
claim that it is likely to happen.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If that entity is benevolent and Libertarian, utility nanites would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; released as they were programmed - to eliminate hunger, starvation, old age,</i><br>
<i>&gt; death, etc.  The world would remain much the same, except most forms of</i><br>
<i>&gt; physically based pain and coercion would be eliminated.  Other utilities might</i><br>
<i>&gt; be more flexible.  No utility will give access to the forbidden molecular</i><br>
<i>&gt; level, but many might give access to higher levels.  People might be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; edit their synapses or their tissue-level body structure.  (The former</i><br>
<i>&gt; scenario might result in Singularity in fairly short order.)</i><br>
<p>
Yes. Never forget to mention the psychoactive drugs that will be <br>
possible though!<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; If that entity is malevolent, immediate and indiscriminate use of nuclear</i><br>
<i>&gt; weapons would be free humanity's only hope of survival.  Humanity can survive</i><br>
<i>&gt; nuclear war and fallout.  It cannot survive molecular warfare.</i><br>
<p>
That's unfortunately the way it looks.<br>
