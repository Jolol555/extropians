     &lt;snip&gt; If nature came up with feeling first and intelligence much <br>
     later, I don't see why the opposite would be true for our computers. <br>
     It's probably a hell of a lot easier to make something that feels but <br>
     doesn't think than something that thinks but doesn't feel.    <br>

     Wow! That notion really hit me when I think of the fact that what took <br>
     a non-human influenced cabon-based world millions of years to <br>
     accomplish, we may accomplish in just a few more decades with our <br>
     silicon-based progeny.  Your comments really put that into perspective <br>
     for me.  The things that can get done with developed cerebral cortexes <br>
     and opposable thumbs!  I'll say again, we live in extraordinary times!<br>
