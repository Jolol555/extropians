**********<br>
I would really propose a serious discussion about the possibility of<br>
our assuming right away a democratic separation of the Homo cyber<br>
&lt; or any other denomination that the group would agree..) <br>
from the Homo sapiens. Most of us are here scientists and could try <br>
to prepair a "communitary" paper to be published on some of the <br>
science journals, where we would define the characterics of the new <br>
human species. This  always, happened in the so-called nature <br>
(from which we are the supreme "creation" and leaders (at least on <br>
earth...)). When a new species feels the real necessity to take a <br>
better way of Evolution... Some say, for example that some of our <br>
ancestrals have migrated from the regions where they were verifying <br>
there were less possibilities of survivor and then the nature arrived <br>
to the "sapiens". Now  the thing may happen again...and we could <br>
migrate to a new existencial region...( To where we have already <br>
going) Besides that, it is * very stressing*  and even dangerous <br>
trying to convince the Homo sapiens, in particular the "teological" <br>
variety, to really evolute ( some of then have even created a <br>
heaven...and "perfectly" created by  a "perfect  being, so, what <br>
more could they wish???) . Who would wish to join us, would be <br>
welcome, who not, just DO NOT PERTURB!!! But first, I suppose, we <br>
should discuss which should be such characteristics. <br>
**********<br>
<p>
PS1: We should talk for example to the transhumanists and other <br>
groups of intelectuals of other areas so we could get better well <br>
succeeded joining our experiences... Wasn't it prophetized that <br>
mankind would change in the Third Millenium?. Or it was just a <br>
religious delirium, or the human being possesses  an extrapolative <br>
perception of the future and just misinterpreted its feelings, <br>
confused with the religious stuff and thought even that world would <br>
finish and... Jesus would come from the clouds: ridiculous... (beware <br>
with the religious's reaction...)<br>
<p>
PS2: If think that,if the main problem is really cultural and, <br>
obviously not ethnic, for example, why not parallely beginnig, to <br>
"sell" the idea of an associated cultural development movement with <br>
the ascension of the Homo sapiens.. We would at least give a chance <br>
to the others's evolution too... Some of them just choose other paths <br>
because have got no other information...<br>
