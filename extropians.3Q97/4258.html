When cloning is involved, you could argue that the right way to decide<br>
whether to take a bet is to look a the outcome on a "per instance" basis.<br>
<p>
Let us suppose that the answer to question 3 ("you are not a clone.<br>
what is the probability that the coin landed heads?") is 1/3, as Eliezer<br>
has it.  He may be willing to give 2-1 odds in making a bet that the<br>
coin will land tails.<br>
<p>
If he did, he would put up $200 and the experimenter would put up $100.<br>
If the coin lands tails, he'd win $100 and not be cloned.  If the coin<br>
landed heads, he'd lose $200, but on a per instance basis that averages<br>
out to a loss of $100 per person.  So the potential gains and losses are<br>
equal on this basis.<br>
<p>
When you get cloned, all your property gets divided by two, at least on<br>
average.  It may not be a step to take lightly.  But the result of the<br>
cloning is that your productivity is doubled.  You can handle twice the<br>
liability afterwards as you could before.  This changes how you should<br>
evaluate bets.<br>
<p>
In effect, cloning makes it a non-zero-sum game.  The changes introduced<br>
by cloning in potential future earnings cause the gains or losses of the<br>
bet to be evaluated differently.  The result is that it may be rational<br>
to take a bet which gives an expected profit to the other player.<br>
