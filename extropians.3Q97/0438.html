<i>&gt;That you should</i><br>
<i>&gt;have a rank of sixty billion or so is much more likely is</i><br>
<i>&gt;only 100 billion persons will ever have lived than if there will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;many trillion persons. Therefore, by Bayes' theorem, you should</i><br>
<i>&gt;update your beliefs about mankind's prospects and realise that</i><br>
<i>&gt;an impending doomsday is much more probable than you have</i><br>
<i>&gt;hitherto thought.</i><br>
<p>
Well I've just tossed heads ten times in a row. Do you want to give me<br>
better than fifty-fifty odds on heads coming up next? If we were able to<br>
randomly select a new life out of all the possible lives that ever lived<br>
and will live and found ourselves in the 20th C then I grant your argument<br>
has some weight. But someone has to come first. I suppose you were standing<br>
next to Neil Armstrong as he stepped up to the launch pad saying "If the<br>
moon is reachable by people then its likely that lots of people will reach<br>
it in the future. The chances that you would be the first are vanishingly<br>
small. Many people have died in the past. Therefore its much more likely<br>
that you will die rather than be the first person to reach the moon".<br>
<p>
This has a very biblical ring to it "the first shall be last". Personally I<br>
prefer a more Extropian version "the first shall be first..."<br>

ciao,  patrick<br>
