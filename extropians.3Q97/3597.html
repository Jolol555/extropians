<p>
That would probably depend on you. Either is possible.<br>
<p>

<p>
In a private system you'd be acting just like a human today; you'd <br>
'think' inside your physical body and send messages out over the net to <br>
other entities. To travel you'd have to move your physical body. On a <br>
centralized system your software would be able to travel from place to <br>
place at the speed of light, *but* other people or AIs could potentially <br>
corrupt the software or copy it and analyse you. This is why I suspect <br>
that private hardware will be more common, at least for rich AIs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2)  Have security and backups been researched?  Could someone 'pull the</i><br>
<i>&gt; plug' and delete everyone? </i><br>
<p>
In theory, yes. But you'd have backups which could be used to restore you,<br>
and on a centralized system you could jump from one machine to another<br>
which had a more reliable power source. A private system could have all<br>
the physical security you desired, and in an emergency you could still<br>
copy your software to another machine before yours was shut down. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Could a virus be introduced to</i><br>
<i>&gt; control/corrupt/erase an uploaded individual?</i><br>
<p>
Yep, just as you could inject a human with the HIV virus today. However,<br>
AIs would probably have better 'immune systems' than humans, since they<br>
wouldn't need to run software that they downloaded. Of course a memetic<br>
virus is a real possibility, particularly if an attacking AI has been able<br>
to analyse your software to look for security holes. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3)  Since 'thought' (as far as I can remember) is somewhat determined by</i><br>
<i>&gt; protein deposits at specific neurons (changing the course to the next</i><br>
<i>&gt; neuron I suppose) wouldn't everyone in a central 'net' then think alike?</i><br>
<p>
No, because they'd all be running different software. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4)  Do emotion and the senses determine how one thinks?  I know my mood</i><br>
<i>&gt; affects my thought processes and certain smells or sounds do also.  How</i><br>
<i>&gt; will this be handled in a 'net'?</i><br>
<p>
Probably, but emotions would/could be included as part of your uploaded<br>
software. If you think computers can't have 'emotions' then you've<br>
probably been watching too many bad SF shows. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 5)  If there would be no emotion I wouldn't 'care' if I were thinking or</i><br>
<i>&gt; not.  Would I cease to exist?  </i><br>
<p>
You'll only find the answer to that question when you upload ;-).<br>
