<i>&gt; &gt;   If the frog's strategy of dehydrating their cells does not work for</i><br>

<p>
me, too, again.  What university?<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; adding cryoprotectants (glycerol or dimethylsulfoxide mostly) is</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessary to preserve microorganisms at very low temperatures. They act</i><br>
<i>&gt; by preventing the formation of water crystals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are indeed complex species (such as some frogs) that can survive</i><br>
<i>&gt; freezing, they do so by producing a cryoprotectant and then spreading it</i><br>
<i>&gt; through the body.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Our case is much different, first because we are obviously much more</i><br>
<i>&gt; complex than any microorganism or even than a frog. </i><br>
<p>
That's not a reason, silly!<br>
<p>
Your second one is though:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Second because the</i><br>
<i>&gt; cryoprotective agent certainly acts differently in our different types</i><br>
<i>&gt; of cells, remember that the frog is 'designed' by Mother Nature to</i><br>
<i>&gt; survive at lower temperatures and therefore it's cells are certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt; much better adapted than ours independently of the cryoprotective agent.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, very true.  This is why it is not a *simple* problem.  I'm not<br>
convinced it's a difficult problem, either.  Our cells aren't THAT<br>
different from a frogs.  The basic constituents and structure are the<br>
same, and that is what is important when considering the damage done to<br>
cells.  Can we duplicate what a frog can do in humans?  I think so.  Can<br>
we do it relatively soon?  I think so.  But I have no evidence to prove or<br>
disprove this statement, nor do you.  So what both of us have to do is<br>
weight the odds.  And those odds are increasing every day.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Finally, all I remember is reading at least one study (yes, I'll try to</i><br>
<i>&gt; find the authors) in which animal brains were frizzed using the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; procedure of cryonics and severe brain damage was observed (see 'How and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why We Age' page 300-301, I know Hayflick is too pessimistic but I agree</i><br>
<i>&gt; with him on this subject). I can find a million of explanations for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; observed brain damage but what I think is the main point is that current</i><br>
<i>&gt; (I don't know how will they be in the future) cryonics does severely</i><br>
<i>&gt; damage the brain, possibly (as far as I know no-one knows for sure)</i><br>
<i>&gt; beyond repair.</i><br>
<p>
Yet, current cryonics will not be current tomorrow.  And if you get a life<br>
insurance policy to pay for cryonic suspension, surely you are not<br>
intending to be frozen with current cryonic techniques?  (unless you<br>
think your life is in danger)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Do you intend to still have a genome in 1000 years.  I don't.  I'll have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; had all the kids I want to by then, so why else would I need one?  If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; don't like the flawed human genome, get rid of it!  Think about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; advancements that have occurred in the last 50 years... now think what we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will be able to do 1000 years from now.  Getting rid of the genome will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; trivial.  This is in essence what "uploading" is, I suggest you do some</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; research.  There is already a multitude of nascent strategies for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; uploading the human mind. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   All this would be irrelevant to you if you think the genome is necessary</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for consciousness- but, again, give me some evidence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll be honest with you, I don't know what uploading is, I think is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; transfer of human consciousness to, say, a computer but that part of</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropism never really called much attention from me. My object of</i><br>
<i>&gt; preservation are my neurons or, specifically, my brain. If I lose my</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain, even that there is a computer with an exact copy of my feelings,</i><br>
<i>&gt; emotions, thoughts, etc, I'll die. Therefore to survive I need to</i><br>
<i>&gt; preserve my brain, probably my body and for that I'll need to maintain a</i><br>
<i>&gt; genome, I can't get rid of my genes.</i><br>
<p>
What's the difference between altering you current brain and genome, and<br>
transferring to a new one?  Is there something special about the neurons<br>
that nature gave us?  And if they're so special, why don't you leave<br>
them the way they are? I'm not so attached to them. As long as I can do<br>
all the same things with my new consciousness-vehicle(or more things), why<br>
should I care whether I've got organic axons or metal ones?<br>
<p>
Don't you think your brain is a bit too fragile?  Personally, I lose<br>
neurons everyday, and they don't grow back.  Don't yours do the same?<br>
Aren't you going to run out eventually?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As for evidence, well it's more of a philosophical, theoretical problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than a biological one. See the few cases I placed in my last two</i><br>
<i>&gt; messages and you'll know what I mean. Personally, I believe (and notice</i><br>
<i>&gt; the verb to believe instead of the usual verb to think) that I'm my</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain and that is my conscience.</i><br>
<p>
I cannot debate against someone who "believes."  Have you read Max More's<br>
paper on Pancritical Rationalism.  I see it as a fairly good alternative<br>
to "believing."  Can't you see that belief stagnates progress?<br>
What if you're wrong?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Why are you placing all your bets on aging research?  This seems overly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; risky :(</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What other options do I have? Cryopreservation? Uploading (what is it</i><br>
<i>&gt; exactly?)?</i><br>
<p>
Yes and yes.  And for your last question, I recommend you go to the<br>
internet and search for it. ( unless someone else can recommend some<br>
books??? )<br>

<i>&gt; Arjen Kamphuis basically already answered this question but I also would</i><br>

<p>
Whoah.  That's pretty pessimistic... but undebatable.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Besides, I'm alive and until I reach the very end I'll try to solve the</i><br>
<i>&gt; aging problem. When I see death before my eyes I'll think of short-term</i><br>
<i>&gt; options such as cryonics but until then, I'll work on life extension and</i><br>
<i>&gt; aging research.</i><br>
<p>
Seems logical.  Just make sure you have enough money, because when you<br>
"see death before your eyes", you won't have much time to make more!<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I wrote another message but since it's not directly related to cryonics</i><br>
