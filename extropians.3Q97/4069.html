<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Ph.D. in physics can rationally hold that "every word of the Old Testament</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; is unvarnished and unmetaphorical fact"? The Earth is only a few thousand</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; years old? God created Adam and Eve and there was no evolution. Such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; physics Ph.D. would have a faith in both senses of the term -- a belief in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; a doctrine, and a belief insensitive to evidence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Actually, he believes that the Universe is several billion years old</i><br>
<i>&gt; depending</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;on Hubble constant, and that evolution is obviously the explanation for all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;human biology.  In fact, he has exactly your attitude towards creationists</i><br>
<i>&gt; who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;make up elaborate reasons why evolution has some tiny flaw.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Whoa! Now I'm really puzzled. How can he simultaneously believe in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; literal truth of the BIble and believe in evolution? The Genesis story is</i><br>
<i>&gt; incompatible with evolution. I suppose he can accept a universe billions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; years old, but he MUST also believe the earth was created in six days (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; that God, pooped out after that effort took a day off to recuperate)</i><br>
<i>&gt; because it clearly says that in the Bible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Maybe I'm coming to this debate late, but most religious people see<br>
Genesis as a highly metaphorical book of the Bible. I would think only<br>
radical fundamentalists and Danikenites would be so literal about it.<br>
