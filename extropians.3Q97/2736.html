The Aug issue of Scientific American has a profile of Jeremy Rifkin,<br>
biological fundamentalist number one.  Here's an eloquent description of<br>
how many of us here view the world by Mr Rifkin from that article.<br>
<p>
	"We're creating multiple personas.  We're creating a thespian<br>
sense of personality where we see ouselves as works of art, and we see<br>
everything in our environment as a prop, as a set, as a stage, as a<br>
backdrop for filling ourselves in.  We don't see ourselves as ever<br>
completed.  We are in-formation."<br>
<p>
You know you're diametricly oposed to someones point of view when their<br>
description of the horrific is to you one of beauty.<br>
<p>
Maybe Max More would like to use this quote to greet visitors to the EXI<br>
web site!  ;&gt;<br>
