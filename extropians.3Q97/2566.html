I just had a bizarre thought. On this list, there are what might be<br>
termed "reputations" and more loosely, "identities." Should not slander<br>
and libel apply to these virtual constructions as well? If your right to<br>
freely associate by way of modem is curtailed because of someone<br>
impersonating you, or making things up about you, should you not have a<br>
reason to seek damages? Of course, damages would be mitigated by the<br>
extreme closeness of the group (and perhaps the ability of list members<br>
to dismiss such things as probably inaccurate) but in the end, what's<br>
the difference? <br>
