Dear Extropians,<br>
<p>
I am on of you.  I am intelligent, hard working and in my deepest <br>
yearnings an extropian to the core.  Despite this I am falling behind.  I am <br>
dying (slowly).  Despite my best efforts at maintaining a healthy body, <br>
quick mind, balanced diet, and adequate regiment of exercise, <br>
anti-ozidants and smart drugs - I AM BURNING OUT.  I am hitting, like a brick <br>
wall, the limits of my biology and psychology/neurology.  I can no longer <br>
keep up with the demands the free-market is placing on me.  At the rate <br>
everything is accelerating, things can only get worse for me.  I will be <br>
lucky to be alive in 5 years - I will run out of energy far sooner.<br>
<p>
Despite working over 50 hours per week and spending another 10 keeping <br>
up with science &amp; technology trends, I am still falling behind <br>
economically.  I expect the skills I have now will be obsolete by the end of 98. <br>
 I no longer have the time nor energy to gain new skills at the rate <br>
required by today’s free-market.  I will probably be obsolete within 2 <br>
years and dead with 5 unless something very *fundamental* changes from the <br>
free-market hell which is killing me.<br>
<p>
Now this is pretty sad when I share your extropian dreams of a better <br>
future while at the same time being increasingly being denied <br>
opportunity from achieving them.  I am a human being and I am an extropian.<br>
<p>
		I DESERVE TO LIVE!<br>
<p>
		I DESERVE TO THRIVE!<br>
<p>
...and so does every other human on this planet who wants to live and <br>
have a better future.<br>
<p>
Look, I want to evolve as much as the next person - but I should have <br>
the right to grow at *my* pace.  Don’t you get it?  I am evolving as <br>
fast as I can!  But the free-market (an autoevolutionary and human <br>
invention if there ever was one - and one which almost everyone on this list <br>
praises) doesn’t give a DAMN about *my* pace.  EITHER I ADAPT TO *ITS* PACE <br>
OR DIE!   As the Bionomics Institute as so poignantly pointed out ‘The <br>
free-market follows the dictates of biological evolution where the <br>
strongest, smartest and fittest survive’(end quote).  Now if that is not a <br>
Fascist dictate what the fuck is?!<br>
<p>
Again, help - I want to live!  I want to live in the amazing future <br>
that is unfolding.  Shouldn’t everyone get an *EQUAL* chance to live well <br>
in the future? <br>
<p>
Otherwise aren’t extropians nazi’s - either by choice or by default?<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
<p>
Holly Pearson<br>
