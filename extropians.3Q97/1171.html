IMHO the word "Evolution" is being consistently misused.  Reference prior<br>
examples such as "higher" evolution..."more" evolved...and my favorite<br>
"Devolved".<br>
<p>
This implies that natural evolution is directed...has a moral sense...has<br>
values..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From reading the works of a leader in the field of Evolution , Richard</i><br>
Dawkins, (The Selfish Gene, Blind Watchmaker, Rive out of Eden)I have a<br>
different impression....namely that evolutionary pressures are relative to<br>
the current situation.  Something that was beneficial in the past may NOT be<br>
benificial now...such as sickle cell enemia.  (remembering that you can't<br>
only do just one thing...and neither can nature)<br>
<p>
As the enviromental pressures change and shift so does evolutionary<br>
pressures.  What was once beneficial may now be detrimental..<br>
<p>
Which gives us a problem....evolution acts VERY slowly...over at least<br>
thousands and more likely Millions of years...Howevef of late our enviroment<br>
has been changing much more rapidly...<br>
<p>
My great-grand father would have been more comfortable and familiar with the<br>
culture thousand years earlier  than his(perhaps...certainly several hundred)<br>
than he would  have been with todays world.<br>
<p>
Where once Muscles, Coordination and Stamina were survival<br>
characterstics...several years ago they would just get you drafted.  Nerds<br>
didn't get drafted (4F)...The ultimate nerd is the richest guy in the US<br>
today...<br>
