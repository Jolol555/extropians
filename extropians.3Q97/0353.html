I'm convinced they could, even in the very unlikely event that it's impossible <br>
to achieve speeds higher than what we can right now, with Von Neumann Machines <br>
they could send several probes to every planet orbiting every star in the <br>
Galaxy in less that 50 million years. Just the blink of an eye. <br>
<p>
I'm convinced they would, I don't see how a life form could be intelligent  <br>
and technological if it didn't have curiosity. So where are they?  <br>
That's the Fermi Paradox.<br>
<p>
I'm also convinced that an intelligent society that had been around for any  <br>
length of time would start to engineer the Universe and be conspicuous even  <br>
at cosmological distances. There is no sign of it. <br>
<p>
It's mind blowing to think that there is other life in the universe, <br>
it's  even more mind blowing to think that there is not and we're alone.<br>
<p>
As for government cover-up, if those jackasses couldn't keep the Watergate <br>
break in secret I don't see how the could keep a flying saucer break up <br>
secret for 50 hours much less 50 years. But I did like "Men In Black", <br>
it's a very funny movie.<br>
