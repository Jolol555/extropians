John Lilly, the one that developed the isolation tank and does experiments in<br>
them with psychoactive chemicals (he's the one they based the movie Altered<br>
States on) had intercepted some transmissions between alien intelligence<br>
(contact with alien intelligence is common with psychoactives) and they said<br>
that we will switch from carbon based life forms to silicon based life forms.<br>
 It makes sense, because if you look at the Periodic Table, silicon is also<br>
4-covalent like carbon, next comes germanium then tin and then lead.  The<br>
exact benefit of this im not sure, but im sure there are benefits, can anyone<br>
think of any?  <br>
