<i>&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; What Klaupatius asked Trurl's wish machine for in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  Lem's _The Cyberiad_: "Make Nothing".</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Which is?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Quoting from memory: "The machine didn't move, it just hummed slightly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Klaupatius looked smug, and Trurl exclaimed 'What did you expect? It</i><br>
<i>&gt;is doing nothing at all!'. 'Yes, but what I was refering to was not</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing, but Nothing, the great void, non-being itself. Obviously</i><br>
<i>&gt;your machine is flawed since it cannot do it'. 'Excuse me', the</i><br>
<i>&gt;machine said, 'but look around...'" Stanislaw Lem is a quite fun author,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and the Cyberiad is another influence on my transhumanist ideas.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I just finished _The Cyberiad_ and thought it was _great_.  I put a<br>
poem from it on my Web page ( <a href="http://members.home.net/kwatson1/">http://members.home.net/kwatson1/</a> ).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From "How the World Was Saved":</i><br>
<p>
	"H'm", muttered Klapaucius, displeased.  "That's supposed to<br>
	be Negative?  Well...let's say it is, for the sake of peace.<br>
	... But now here's the third command:  Machine, do Nothing!"<br>
	The machine sat still.  Klapaucius rubbed his hands in triumph,<br>
	but Trurl said:<br>
	"Well, what did you expect?  You asked it to do nothing, and<br>
	it's doing nothing."<br>
	"Correction:  I asked it to do Nothing, but it's doing nothing."<br>
	"Nothing is nothing!"<br>
	"Come, come.  It was supposed to do Nothing, but it hasn't done<br>
	anything, and therefore, I've won."<br>
	[... ...]suddenly its metallic voice rang out:<br>
	"Really, how can you two bicker at a time like this?  Oh yes, I<br>
	know what Nothing is, and Nothingness, Nonexistence,[...]<br>
	Look then upon your world for the last time, gentlemen!  Soon<br>
	it shall no longer be..."<br>
	The constructors froze, forgetting their quarrel, for the<br>
	machine was in actual fact doing Nothing, and it did it in<br>
	this fashion:  one by one, various things were removed from<br>
	the world[....]<br>
<p>
Not bad from memory, Anders!  But "Klaupatius"?  ;-)<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
