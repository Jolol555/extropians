<i>&gt; US dollars overseas are not backed by gold, or US gov't services, and</i><br>

<i>&gt; In a sense, modern currency is backed by valuable goods: it is backed by</i><br>
<i>&gt; all the valuable goods in existence.</i><br>
<p>
It's more than just a "belief".  People are obligated by law to accept<br>
U.S. dollars for goods, in at least a couple of ways.  First, the legal<br>
tender laws state that dollars can be used to pay off debts.  I've read<br>
differing interpretations of exactly how this works, but at a minimum,<br>
if you offer someone dollars to discharge a debt, and he refuses to take<br>
them, he cannot proceed with any sort of collection procedures as long<br>
as your offer is in force.  (Some people say that the debt is completely<br>
discharged by this procedure.)<br>
<p>
Secondly, there are contracts which explicitly state a value in dollars.<br>
One example is mortgages.  With a mortgage, the lender retains title to<br>
the property.  The mortgage contract states that upon presentation of<br>
a certain number of dollars, title is transferred.  The total value of<br>
mortgages is approximately equal to the total money supply (unsurprisingly,<br>
if you understand where money comes from).  This then gives backing in<br>
terms of real property.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; } You need backing with a useful, valuable commodity (or service) in order</i><br>
<i>&gt; } for something to be accepted as money (or else the money itself needs to</i><br>
<i>&gt; } be useful and valuable, like gold has been historically).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Gold was hardly useful or practically valuable itself.  Jewelry only</i><br>
<i>&gt; goes so far, and chip wires are new and also probably don't go that</i><br>
<i>&gt; far.  (You can't eat gold.)  But everyone believed that everyone else</i><br>
<i>&gt; would sell food or iron or blacksmithing for gold, so everyone sold</i><br>
<i>&gt; things for gold.  Again, the real backing is mutual agreement, or rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; faith and habit which may get rationalized as mutual agreement.  (Or</i><br>
<i>&gt; they may not.)</i><br>
<p>
The big problem with getting something new accepted as money is<br>
bootstrapping it.  It has to be valuable enough that people will accept<br>
it even before everyone else will.  Gold and other early forms of money<br>
(beads, etc.) had that property.  Fiat notes issued by me, scrawled on<br>
a scrap of paper, do not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can't see that there's any serious problem with fiat currency except</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ability to "print" a lot of it, which seems to be generally accepted</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a bad idea these days.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, historically the number of examples of fiat currency inflation has<br>
almost been too many to count.<br>
<p>
The bigger problem IMO is that usually any form of competition is<br>
disallowed.  If the fiat currency had to compete with privately issued<br>
banknotes that would provide needed discipline.<br>
<p>
At one time, casino chips began to be accepted in a small form in Las<br>
Vegas for purchases.  (I think this was largely a promotional effort by<br>
the casinos, something to be fun for the customers.)  This was stopped<br>
because it violated the currency laws.  Similar attempts to set up local<br>
scrips have also had problems.  They may be tolerated on a small scale,<br>
but if they show signs of spreading they will be halted.<br>
