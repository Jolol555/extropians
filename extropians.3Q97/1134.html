Now, nevermind the usual lament about our memory not being what it used to<br>
be. (I suspect I only remember the old list because I haven't read it for<br>
so long, so those memories haven't been overwritten by new memories of the<br>
list.)  I think Perry might have an actual problem down the road, when he<br>
gets *really* old.<br>
<p>
I'm curious if people thing long-term memory retention will be a problem<br>
for people who live much longer in their current bodies and brains.  Kim<br>
Stanley Robinson describes this in his Mars trilogy (don't even get me<br>
STARTED about his idiotic economics - grrrrr), but he doesn't give much<br>
support for why memory should fade as badly as he makes it.  He seems to be<br>
extrapolating from current aging trends, and then makes his longevity<br>
treatment incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and fixing memory<br>
problems as it does other problems of aging.<br>
<p>
If we don't make his assumptions, do we still think this will be a big<br>
concern?  If we fix Alzheimer's, what are the reasons to think that<br>
long-term memory is more limited for 140 year olds than for 40 year olds?<br>
If this really is a problem, maybe it's a use for those life-recordings,<br>
no?  It would suck if you lost all the experiences that happened between<br>
childhood and when you get uploaded.<br>
<p>
Personally Concerned,<br>
