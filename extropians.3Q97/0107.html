Are you joking, or have you made up your mind about this?<br>
I'm not being sarcastic here--but I have a very mixed reaction<br>
to the notion of "fixing" people, especially without their consent.<br>
<p>
Extinguishing them *might* be more ethical. I'm not sure.<br>
<p>
I have another series of bones to pick with the entire idea of <br>
"trials"--they seem to be mostly about making the local mass of <br>
primates feel better. _Sometimes_ that includes feeling like you'd <br>
have gotten a fair shake if you were in the defendant's shoes, but <br>
I daresay that's not prominent in the mind of many of today's jurors.<br>
<p>
Is that (palliating the masses' feelings) all "justice" amounts to?<br>
<p>
One of the fundamental pivots of my current researches is the whole <br>
matter of "fairness". I suspect it relates to 1) the universe <br>
making sense and being predictable and 2) comfort (see #1).<br>
<p>
Correction to above re "trials": <br>
Unless they are trials pertaining to extinction as an outcome.<br>
And then they're not about justice per se, but strategic sessions: <br>
see the second half of _Have Spacesuit, Will Travel_.<br>
<p>
One thing is clear: "banishment" is probably not a viable strategy<br>
once civilizations (or whatever they are by then) span galactic arms...<br>
