<i>&gt; Ska? Cool! I am fan of (old-school) ska. </i><br>
<p>
There is no other kind in my book. Extropians take note -- if anarchy is<br>
your mantra, learn to skank and check out the punk scene. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I do have to say that "ska" as</i><br>
<i>&gt; currently defined in popular media is significantly different than the CDs</i><br>
<i>&gt; I collected from the 80s (and before).</i><br>
<p>
I would tend to agree, just look at the "newly refurbished" Bosstones.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It seems that the term "ska" has</i><br>
<i>&gt; been co-opted to create the latest "cool genre".</i><br>
<p>
The ska scene (and to a lesser extent the now overinclusive punk scene)<br>
was born out of a certain disregard for mainstream values and tastes.<br>
Die-hard skinheads (I'm talking about "rude boys" not the white<br>
supremacists) have become very territorial these days about their music.<br>
I've been to three ska shows already this summer (Blue Meanies,<br>
Pietasters, Spring Heeled Jack) where the MTV-birthed neo-ska crowd<br>
found themselves trampled underfoot -- literally. A lot of old-timers<br>
react violently to this adolescent infiltration. For them, it's a<br>
lifestyle -- and they don't want anyone diluting it.    <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Bands like No Doubt may</i><br>
<i>&gt; demonstrate some ska influences, but the music doesn't really resemble ska</i><br>
<i>&gt; as represented by The Specials, Madness, and even earlier groups like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Skatellites(sp?).</i><br>
 <br>
Skatalites.<br>
<p>
I was at first intrigued by the notion of a ska band with a frontwoman.<br>
I had seen pictures of Gwen Stefani in Spin and RS, along with articles<br>
suggesting that No Doubt's "unique form of ska" owed much to her bizarre<br>
vocals.<br>
<p>
Then I listened to them.<br>
<p>
True her voice is quite interesting, but there's very little ska to be<br>
found in the music -- just a horn or two and some quick upstrums on the<br>
guitar every now and then.<br>
<p>
As far as my favorite ska groups go, I love the Specials and the<br>
Skatalites -- you almost have to. Old Bosstones, The Pietasters, and the<br>
Toasters are also way up there. My friend's band Spring Heeled Jack is<br>
phenomenal (along the lines of Reel Big Fish) and then there's all the<br>
ska-core like Mephiskapholes, The Skeletones, and Voodoo Glow Skulls. <br>
<p>
If you ever get the chance (and it seems unlikely since they've broken<br>
up) but Connecticut ska-lord Joe Curran's old band The Spicy Gribblets<br>
puts on perhaps the greatest live ska show I've ever seen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes, techno and electronica in general is a genre for which I have an</i><br>
<i>&gt; affinity.  My personal influences tend to be in the techno/trance/ambient</i><br>
<i>&gt; area, but occasionally the influence of 80's darker synth pop (along the</i><br>
<i>&gt; lines of the New Order, Pet Shop Boys, Cure) sometimes appear to trickle</i><br>
<i>&gt; into my work, most likely because I have a fairly large collection of that</i><br>
<i>&gt; stuff as well.  At one time or other I have been involved in nearly every</i><br>
<i>&gt; major music style I can think of.  I like music for its own sake.</i><br>
<p>
As do I. I'm not so up on my electronica, although I dig the hard-core<br>
stuff like Cubanate and Atari Teenage Riot. Also, Prodigy and the<br>
Chemical Brothers are my main techno-based staples.<br>
<p>
I've been toying with the idea of working a ska-techno hybrid, possibly<br>
even reggae-techno. I'd be interested to hear any DJs that may have<br>
already attmepted this.   <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I currently use Performer, but have used a few other packages.  The state</i><br>
<i>&gt; of sequencers is such that it doesn't really matter what you use as long as</i><br>
<i>&gt; you learn how to use it well.  Having not previously used sequencers under</i><br>
<i>&gt; MacOS, the choice of Performer was completely random.  I don't currently</i><br>
<i>&gt; have any audio recording capability, but I am looking into the various</i><br>
<i>&gt; digital 8-track hard-disk systems, both modular and computer-based.</i><br>
<p>
I need to do some serious homework on this. I think I'll start by<br>
looking at Performer. Thanks.<br>
<p>
Should we take this to private e-mail?<br>
