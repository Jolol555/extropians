<i>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that the intent of the 2nd ammendment had little or nothing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; do with self defense.....or hunting.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've done little legislative history concerning the 2nd, but an educated</i><br>
<i>&gt; guess would be that to get it ratified, the delegates made both of those</i><br>
<i>&gt; arguments, and more. Hunting for meat and/or the skins trade was pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt; important both economically and also for an individual's livelihood. And</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-defense has always been offered as a valid reason for weapons</i><br>
<i>&gt; proliferation. Unfortunately, the Congress was secret and the only notes</i><br>
<i>&gt; made were Madison's and Jefferson's (?) so we have a tough time knowing</i><br>
<i>&gt; what they were really trying to do.</i><br>
<p>
Seeing as they were the main writers, whatever the rest may have thought<br>
it was in the haggling to get it passed is irrelevant...or nearly so,<br>
with the possible exception of B. Franklin.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What is crucial is that the drafters offered a reason for the Amendment</i><br>
<i>&gt; within the text itself, "A well-regulated militia being necessary to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; security of a free state..." However, is this the only reason? And what</i><br>
<i>&gt; happens when a well-regulated militia no longer becomes necessary?</i><br>
<p>
One bit of interesting point of debate is where the commas belong in the<br>
sentence... putting one after militia makes for an entirely different<br>
meaning than putting it after state.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyway, I personally feel that the legislative intent is irrelevant.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are several canons of statutory construction, some placing</i><br>
<i>&gt; emphasis on the "plain meaning" of the words as written, others</i><br>
<i>&gt; emphasizing legislative intent, still others ignoring both and opting</i><br>
<i>&gt; for Constiutional dynamism. I tend to feel that especially where the</i><br>
<i>&gt; original intent is cloudy, and the plain meaning of words such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; "militia", "Arms", and "infringed" is unclear, a more suitable line of</i><br>
<i>&gt; inquiry is "What effect should these words have on our lives today?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a somewhat distilled version of Constitutional dynamism.</i><br>
<p>
One of the biggest points of debate is over the meaning of the word<br>
People. Liberal authoritarians claim that it refers to the people as a<br>
whole, while libertarians say, and most credible constitutional scholars<br>
agree, to the extreme displeasure of the media, that the use of the word<br>
People in the Constitution consistently refers to individual citizens<br>
rights rather than community rights.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Taken in context with the Declaration of Independence...and the Federalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Papers...I would interpret the 2nd ammendment as the ultimate gaurantor of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; individual rights...or to put it crudely.....when the government gets outa</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hand...the citizens have the means to slap it down..</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Framers built-in a self-destruct mechanism. This is an entirely new</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea to me, and quite interesting.</i><br>
<p>
Rather a mechanism to ensure constant regeneration and clearing away of<br>
the rot of corruption. An important quote, which was recently used<br>
against Timothy McVeigh because he had it on his T-shirt, was of<br>
Jefferson who said after supporting Shay's Rebellion: "a little<br>
rebellion is good for the country"...."we should see a rebellion every<br>
20 years or so".."the tree of liberty, from time to time, must be<br>
replenished with the blood of tyrants and patriots."<br>
<p>
I suggest that everyon reread the Declaration of Independence. You'll<br>
notice that the founding fathers supported the idea that men are morally<br>
bound to rebel against and overturn corrupt and tyrannical governments.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In that context automatic weapons...not to mention rockets..mortars or pocket</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nukes seem perfectly acceptable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Exactly. The definition of "Arms" as it is used in the 2nd is one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; biggest problems.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hagbard</i><br>
<p>
I would say that it is one of its biggest strengths. It ensures that the<br>
responsibility for whatever deterrent power is necessary to ensure the<br>
security of the state rests in the individual.<br>
<p>
A number of our founding fathers posessed much more than pistols and<br>
muskets. Prior to the expansion of the US Cavalry, most cannon in the US<br>
were privately owned, especially those built for use at sea, as most<br>
Americam merchant ships had to defend themselves against piracy and the<br>
agressive use of force on the part of England, France, the Dutch, and<br>
Spain to enforce protection of trade monopolies.<br>
<p>
In fact, several members of the Continental Congress made their livings<br>
as privateers with fast, well armed gunboats. NOTE: a privateer is<br>
notably different from, though sometimes similar to, pirates, in that<br>
they typically practiced smuggling and blockade running rather than<br>
piracy. In this respect, Washington and Jefferson are not much different<br>
from Clinton in hanging out with smugglers...<br>
