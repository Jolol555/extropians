In the interests of forming a clearer concept of the future...<br>
Does anyone have any suggestions regarding what might *not*<br>
have changed, after a Singularity? For example, the<br>
fundamental laws of physics, whatever they are, should<br>
presumably remain as they were. Perhaps there are economic<br>
laws that would remain valid (but will there still be<br>
"markets"?).<br>
<p>
Perhaps the consequences of a Singularity are highly<br>
contingent, in that they depend critically upon the<br>
goals of the beings that survive the nano-wars, or<br>
Transcend first, or whatever. The characteristic shared<br>
by the definitions of Singularity that I can think of<br>
is that they all refer to technology. Whatever else<br>
it is, the Singularity is a point at which "godlike"<br>
technologies arrive, technologies with which one might<br>
reshape the universe or construct new ones. The<br>
consequences of the Singularity depend on what is done<br>
with those technologies; what does *that* depend on?<br>
