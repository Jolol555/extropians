(Fairly optimised). Germs are highly optimised, given <br>
certain design constraints, shaped as they are by immense selection <br>
pressure and short generation cycles. Cars are optimised. Much <br>
commersial software is also fairly optimised. But you have a point <br>
here. There is also commersial software whose performance is not <br>
optimized, and in some cases it can still it can be highly <br>
non-trivial to design it. So if that is the relevant analogy then it <br>
points in the direction Carl intended it to.<br>

<p>
Really? I thought I've heard that the Universal Turing machine was <br>
actually designed, with streams of gliders serving as tape etc. But I <br>
may be wrong, in which case I'm glad you pointed it out. Do you have <br>
any references?<br>
