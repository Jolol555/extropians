Maybe I should not reply to this... <br>
But I cannot let it go... (sorry Wax, I know you hate all the political<br>
stuff). <br>

Not all uniform stand for the same kind of violence, no uniform often<br>
stands for uncontrolled and chaotic violence. A UN peace force will do it's<br>
best to minimize deaths of *all* parties involved, something that is not<br>
the priority of rather loosly organized civil-militia (having seen the<br>
difference I think I can say this). Most of the deaths in yugoslavia were<br>
'collaterals', unarmed civilians (many women and children) who did not want<br>
to have anything to do with the war. I hope you do not expect<br>
six-year-olds, whose parents have been killed, to defend themselves with a<br>
AK-47 when somebody is shooting at them with 105mm artillery shells.<br>
Because *that* is what happened.<br>

guns,<br>
<i> &gt;&amp; most of them were murdered with machetes.</i><br>
<p>
Would not have been the prefferd option to have *prevented* that massacre<br>
of the first 500.000 by timely intervention by the UN? I thinl about half a<br>
million ghosts would agree. It will now take several generations to heal<br>
the social and cultural wounds that have been inflicted, these people have<br>
to find a way to live together somehow. But how?<br>
We, the west that is, should have prevented this from happening in the<br>
first place. We had the information, we had the manpower, we lacked in<br>
vision and guts.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;In the Balkan War, the Bosnian Moslems were fighting a losing battle until</i><br>
<i> &gt;they got arms &amp; advisers from Iran, at which point they not only stopped the</i><br>
<i> &gt;Bosnian Serb's onslaught of "ethnic cleansing," in which gang rape &amp; torture</i><br>
<i> &gt;were the chosen instruments of terrorizing the Moslems into retreat, but </i><br>
<i> &gt;actually recaptured some lost ground.</i><br>
<p>
The only thing the UN did right was preventing a 'Religious war' wich would<br>
have set the entire Balkan in flames (those sentiments go back 1500 years)<br>
and caused many more deaths.<br>
They did recapture some ground yes, and then did some raping and murdering<br>
themselves (hey, no-one said the Muslims were in someway morally advanced<br>
over Serbs or something), there was no-one to stop them. The recapturing of<br>
a stretch of land did not bring back any dead and in the fighting many more<br>
*civilians*, be they Serb or Muslim, were killed. From a military viewpoint<br>
the action was somewhat succesful. From the viewpoint of Serb civilians,<br>
most of whom did not want the war in the first place and had not done<br>
*anything* to anybody, it was just as horrible as the ehtnic cleansing<br>
ordered by Serb leaders was for the Muslims.<br>
<p>
Of course the muslims had the *right* to shoot back. Of course. But saying<br>
that this was the best solution is ignoring many additional deaths of<br>
people who just wanted to be left in peace. The greater part of the<br>
Yugoslavians didn't want he war. I talked to many of them, they hated it.<br>
And to this day they do not understand why *we* (mostly the Western<br>
European countries) did not do anything for years. How do you explain to a<br>
mother who has lost her husband, three children and right-leg that NATO is<br>
'negotiating' with Serb High-Command in Geneva? That's a 'thougie' (new<br>
word I learned yesterday).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Then, all of a sudden, the Bosnian</i><br>
<i> &gt;Serbs started saying: "What's that? NATO &amp; the UN want us to make peace?</i><br>
<i> &gt;What a good idea! Why didn't we think of that sooner?"</i><br>
<p>
Actually the Serbain leaders did not want to make peace until NATO-jets and<br>
artillery blasted their positions to very tiny bits in 1 week, something<br>
the muslims had not had much succes in (having only light weapons). The UN<br>
should of course mandated this action in 1992. But Europe lacked resolve<br>
(as they always do) and CLinton was busy winning the elections. And most of<br>
us had shopping to do and tax-forms to fill in, everybody was very busy.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;By way of contrast, every single major genocide this century has been of a</i><br>
<i> &gt;victim group which has been previously disarmed by law. Jews for the </i><br>
<i> &gt;Preservation of Firearms Ownership has published a book documenting this,</i><br>
<i> &gt;called "Lethal Laws."</i><br>
<p>
The Jews in the Warchau Ghetto had at some point firearms, The SS bombed<br>
the hell out of them. I don't think more than a handful survived (they were<br>
deported and kiled later of course). Sure some Germans got killed also,<br>
great. Hey, some of them problably deserved it. I wouldn't know, having not<br>
been born yet. But the whole thing did not save a single life. The Jews<br>
acted justifiably of course but after a short while they were just as dead.<br>
The worst thing was that British and American High-Command knew what was<br>
going on in Poland from 1942, requests from resistance groups to bomb the<br>
railroads to the camps were denied as being "not a startegic priority".<br>
Figure that.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;"If guns are outlawed, only the government will have guns. Only the police,</i><br>
<i> &gt;the secret police, the military, the hired servants of our rulers. Only the</i><br>
<i> &gt;government--and a few outlaws. I intend to be among the outlaws."</i><br>
<p>
Again, it comes down how much you trust your governement, if you really,<br>
really don't, if you really believe they are corrupt, ineffective and 'out<br>
to control you' for the sake of it. If *that* is what you really believe.<br>
Well...<br>
Guess it's time for a second American revolution then. You did it once, you<br>
should be able to do it again. At the price of world leadership of course<br>
(The Chinese leaders might use the opportunity - I would in their position).<br>
<p>
If I believed what many people on this list seem to believe about their<br>
governement I'd either begin a revolution or get out of the country.<br>
Because if the above paragraph is true then you're not living in democracy,<br>
but in a police-state (no offence, really, but that is how it reads).<br>
<p>
I really hope you don't because I have enjoyed visiting the US so far.<br>
Nice people, nice countryside, much like Yugoslavia before 1991 actually.<br>
