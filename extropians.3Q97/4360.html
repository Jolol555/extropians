Hey!  I thought of a neat game to play.  Analyze the NSPIC postings,<br>
CSICOP or "Cult Awareness" style, to see how many attributes of a cult,<br>
or of fixated thinking, they have.  Of course the first step is finding<br>
any traces of actual thinking.<br>
<p>
I don't think I'll be much good at this, but I'll at least try to start.<br>
<p>
Quotes are unattributed because I can't tell who wrote what at this<br>
stage.<br>
<p>
} Remember what the first step must accomplish.  It must lift the NSPIC from<br>
} the minds of those who enforce the NSPIC.  It's slow work!<br>
<p>
} Almost everybody enforces NSPIC.  I find it really amazing that most people<br>
} don't realize they're doing it.  That makes NSPIC self-enforcing.  It's not a<br>
<p>
"You don't believe what we're saying?  That just shows that you're part<br>
of the problem!  You must accept the truth of NSPIC and lift it from<br>
yourself to escape it."  This seems to be a variant of "believe us...<br>
join us... and the problem will fade (you will be free)" and "everyone<br>
is against us".  Unconsciously against "us", but still enforcing NSPIC.<br>

WesBurt met Mr. Plonk after posting his reply to reactions he ran into<br>
on another list, in which he apparently accused the flood of unsubscribe<br>
requests as an attempt to make it appear that the list manager had<br>
unscrupulously signed up many people without their permission.  He then<br>
exhorted them to stick it out, and if they didn't like things anyway,<br>
they could just use the delete key until they figured out how to<br>
unsubscribe.  I'm not sure what this qualifies as, although the first<br>
bit seems to be standard paranoia -- "they're out to frame us!"<br>
<p>
} I agree. I think this is even more important when you consider<br>
} how many "adults" have the intellectual capacity of a 10-year old.<br>
 <br>
Er, however that's measured.<br>
<p>
} If this can't be done the destruction of Ingrid will cause terrible loss<br>
} and retribution.<br>
} &gt;If you are implying that this list isn't up to communicating<br>
} through my<br>
} &gt;AI, called Ingrid, then I would really appreciate being put in<br>
<p>
} The time required to implement AND to identify the barriers to<br>
} understanding NSPIC AND <br>
<p>
And this, alas, shows the difficulty in finding material worth making<br>
fun of... part gibberish, part CAPITAL LETTERS, but pointing out the<br>
latter doesn't feel very satisfying.<br>
<p>
} Again, what the hell is Ingrid?  Someone also briefly mentioned that it<br>
} wasn't available for the Mac.  <br>
<p>
I missed this, but the sudden connection to a practical concern struck<br>
me as wildly amusing, briefly.  "Super Duper Software will Save the<br>
World!!! ... only available for Windows 95."<br>
