I'm working on the actual _form_ of the OTC. <br>
We could have an awards ceremony.<br>
But how to choose the nominating committe?<br>
<p>
Danny, are you by any chance going to be at <br>
the Extro conference in August? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Some of you are too predictable</i><br>
<i>&gt; and uptight  </i><br>
<p>
Which of course is far inferior to being too <br>
predictable in any other way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Awe, go ahead and post, I think anything should be allowed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; post, as long as it's interesting, and water-powered cars, proper food</i><br>
<i>&gt; combining, pole shifts, and especially psychedelics are very interesting.</i><br>
<p>
Danny, I think singing "100 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" after<br>
inhaling nitrous oxide at the dentist is interesting. Fascinating.<br>
Absolutely the best use of my time imaginable. Hey, LIVE A LITTLE!<br>
<p>
But I don't do it in front of people who've made it clear that they think<br>
it's a waste of time, unless they're being paid to listen--like my<br>
dentist. I especially don't try to convince them it's not a waste of<br>
their time.<br>
<p>
Have a clue, they're cheap. Some experiences are personal, and don't<br>
travel well. Self-transformation through the use of nootropics is<br>
possibly a matter for this list. "Food combining", by my guess, is<br>
over the edge into the Twilight Zone. Nth-hand reports<br>
of self-sustaining electrolysis used to power cars are useless.<br>
<p>
Being hardheaded is hard, sometimes. But the hardheads have helped<br>
keep the rest of the humans alive. Cut them some credit. OK?<br>
