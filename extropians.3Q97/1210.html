In a message dated 97-07-27 11:42:51 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  It is somewhere<br>
 between a thousand and a million times as capable as<br>
 my first computer. There is no evidence that this trend<br>
 will slow in the next 20 years, but we keep making projections<br>
 that underestimate or ignore the consequences. If we add in the<br>
 closely-related advances in data cumunications, this is<br>
 IMO the single most important trend affecting the future<br>
 of humanity. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
Vernor Vinge, my favorite author, addresses this in his book "The Peace<br>
War"...<br>
<p>
I fully expect implantable computers to become available in the not-so<br>
distant future...the term "need more memory?" will take on a whole new<br>
meaning.  Telepathy...via packet data then nureal interface ...will be<br>
possible....Telepresence , will make the daily commute less of a chore.<br>
<p>
Very few people are addressing these likely changes....it's very<br>
frusturating.<br>
