Hello Extropes,<br>
<p>
I promised an art director that I would try to spread the word<br>
about a interesting project that he has created and is now<br>
directing at a small company in Massachusetts. The man's name<br>
is David Durlach and his company is called Technofrolics.<br>
<p>
This man is seeking graduate physics, math, engineering, computer science students who might  be interesting in doing a thesis with his work<br>
that he calls: "3-D Dancing Sculptures". <br>
<p>
His 3-D dancing sculptures are iron dust filings that he controls<br>
via electromagnets, which are, in turn controlled by computer. <br>
His "dust" dances to music.<br>
<p>
The kind of work that a potential grad student might do with<br>
his dust sculptures is:<br>
<p>
1)     Develop an environment in which mappings between information<br>
extracted from the music and dance choreography may be easily tested.<br>
2)      Refinine a (virtual) non-linear-oscillator-based beat-tracking<br>
algorithm.<br>
3)      Develop real-time software simulations of physical systems to act<br>
as intermediary objects between information extracted from the music and<br>
the control signals sent to the artworks.<br>
4)      Explore/develop DSP algorithms and methods helpful in extracting<br>
dance-relevant information from the digitally sampled music.<br>
<p>
I may or may not be involved as a kind of advisor in wavelet-related<br>
aspects of the project (we are still discussing this).<br>
<p>
His dancing artwork won the Most Popular Invention award at the <br>
Boston Museum of Science and David Durlach has also built a number<br>
of "animated dust" displays for corporations for trade shows.<br>
<p>
You can learn more about him and his "dancing dust" by reading<br>
the very nice article in Discover magazine, which can be accessed<br>
on the Web:<br>

<p>
My personal opinion is that this project would be fun fun fun, and I <br>
was really tickled to learn about it. It is a blending of physics and art<br>
and entertainment in the best way.<br>
