Poor Jim Legg.  He and his buddies (and perhaps some of his tentacles<br>
too?) rudely conspire to barrage the extropians list with their<br>
little meme-bombs, and then when (as usual) the techies start<br>
arranging to route around the damage, even going so far as to offer<br>
to redistribute a filtered list to those people who don't want to<br>
be bothered with tweaking their own killfiles/filters/equiv, Legg<br>
starts whining about "police".<br>
<p>
Legg, a policeman is a guy with a gun telling you what to do.  No<br>
one is telling you what to do, and no one is threatening you with<br>
any guns.  The reaction to your unbridled rudeness and your utter<br>
disrespect for the wishes of the members of the community you are<br>
imposing upon has been one of remarkable restraint and patience.<br>
But since you reacted by squawking about "police" and being repressed,<br>
censored, etc. (when in fact, you have been merely rerouted around),<br>
I'm tempted to shame you into ceasing and desisting.  Hence this<br>
post.<br>
<p>
Don't bother replying: you're plonked.  But please do take your<br>
social engineering schemes elsewhere.  No one is going to argue<br>
them on their merits with you, because of the clownish means by<br>
which you have already sought to "legitimize" their discussion<br>
in this forum.  You've gone and shot yourself in the foot<br>
before you even got started.<br>
