I have to confess that I have never heard of jury nullification, but it has<br>
my curiousity.<br>
<p>
Could someone explain (in a paragraph or so) what jury nullification is<br>
exactly, and what is the<br>
basis for its existence?  Or at least point me to a source for more info.<br>
<p>
I learn something new every day...<br>
