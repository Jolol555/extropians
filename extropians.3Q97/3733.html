<i>&gt; Complex barter is too hard to keep track of - without computers,</i><br>

<p>
Then Anton rejoins:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So you'd abolish money *and* keep it.  Wonderful.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or did you just mean abolish fiat money?  No argument here.</i><br>
<p>
Then Eliezer comes back:<br>

<i>&gt; No, I'd *obsolete* money.  By money, I mean not merely gov't fiat money, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; any unit of exchange which is declared, by public or private authority, to</i><br>
<i>&gt; have non-intrinsic value, or value pegged to a product which fluctuates in</i><br>
<i>&gt; demand.  A unit of exchange has substance; a unit of valuation is simply a</i><br>
<i>&gt; measuring tool.</i><br>
<p>
A unit of valuation is a measuring tool, like a meter stick?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Compare a meter-stick and a meter.  Do you really want to</i><br>
<i>&gt; measure a building in "meter-sticks", or speed in "kilometer-sticks/hour"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; And every time you want to find out how tall something is, you can *only* use</i><br>
<i>&gt; meter-sticks; and if you want to tell someone else how tall something is, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to give him a bundle of meter-sticks.  Don't forget that the meter-sticks</i><br>
<i>&gt; shrink and expand at random!</i><br>
<p>
Wait a minute. I thought you were saying that a complex barter economy<br>
can still have standardized units of valuation? Are you mixing up your<br>
metaphors? So far all you've suggested is that standardized units of<br>
valuation are *more* difficult to work with than actual units of<br>
exchange with artifical value. <br>
<p>
I'm also interested in how a unit of valuation would begin to perform<br>
its function. It seems that the initial decision to use a unit of<br>
valuation requires an arbitrary statement by someone, or an agreement<br>
among many, to say that 1 wooglestrat has X value. There are several<br>
ways to compute value, but all of them are relative to something else.<br>
What would you make your units of valuation relative to?<br>
<p>
Though I don't label myself a libertarian, I do like Harry Browne's<br>
description of why money becomes necessary. It can be found at<br>
<a href="http://www.saf.org/pub/rkba/wais/data_files/shell/libertarian/king/chaptr04">http://www.saf.org/pub/rkba/wais/data_files/shell/libertarian/king/chaptr04</a><br>
and I think it is salient here. <br>
