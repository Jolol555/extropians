<i>&gt; So why the hostility? I see no reason to believe Velikovsky's theory, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; while it's highly improbable, it's certainly possible. Unlike, say, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; perpetual motion folks, Velikovsky has claimed nothing that breaks any</i><br>
<i>&gt; known law of science. So why is it that mention of him causes such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; knee-jerk reaction from so many people? </i><br>
<p>
Because that's not true: Velikofsky's claims are quite impossible in<br>
many ways: "Manna" as described in Exodus appeared on the ground in the<br>
mornings as was nutricious: anything falling from the sky would be very<br>
different.  The parting of the Red Sea (another Velikofsky claim) does<br>
not follow any laws of gravity or fluid dynamics.  The timing of the<br>
passes of Venus does not comport with any reasonable stretch of the law<br>
of gravity.<br>
<p>
But beyond all that, Velikofsky deserves ridicule not for merely being<br>
wrong--as many good scientists, including Sagan, have been--but for<br>
doing the exact opposite of science itself: by taking the conclusions<br>
first, and stretching the facts to fit them, rather than starting with<br>
observations, postulating ideas that fit the facts, then testing them<br>
to reach conclusions.  Velikofsky is not merely a bad scientist, or<br>
even a non-scientist; he's an anti-scientist, and an apologist for<br>
theists.<br>
<p>
I lost a lot of respect for Sagan when he sued Apple for making fun<br>
of him, but despite that, he's always maintained at least a modicum<br>
of epistemological integrity and scientific honesty--even his "nuclear<br>
winter" work was an honest possibility arising from observed phenomena<br>
and reasonable guesses about unknowns.  As it happened, his guesses<br>
were wrong, but he never tried to hide them, and he always used the<br>
known facts as they were.  Like Velikofsky, his guesses were perhaps<br>
motivated by religious prejudice--in Sagan's case his environmental<br>
beliefs, so Sagan loses another point on that, but he's still so far<br>
above Velikofsky on the scale that it's hardly worth noting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; BTW, is the Paul Ehrlich who co-authored 'The cold and the dark' the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; one who was predicting mass starvation in the seventies? If so, Sagan</i><br>
<i>&gt; could clearly have picked better people to work with on his models. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, and he deserves to be put closer to the Velikofsky camp, as you say.<br>
<p>
Maybe we should evaluate scientists on a scale of integrity and rigor:<br>
We'll make Richard Feynmann a 10.0, L. Ron Hubbard a 0.0.  That puts<br>
Velikofsky in the 0.5 range, Sagan probably around 7.0.<br>
