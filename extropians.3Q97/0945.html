Forrest used an unconventional quoting system; I actually wrote the section<br>
you're replying to.  No I haven't read the essay. We're all agreeing on being<br>
positive and realistic, and on what we'd *like* "optimism" to mean.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Once you understand the difference between dynamic optimism and wishful</i><br>
<i>&gt;thinking, do you still disagree with D.O.? If so, what exactly do you</i><br>
<i>&gt;disagree with?</i><br>
<p>
The terminology.  "Optimism" does have something of a Polyanna connotation<br>
(not to say that optimists are necessarily either Polyanna types or<br>
unrealistic).  Qualifying optimism with "Dynamic" doesn't make me think "oh,<br>
that's the levelheaded realistic type", nor would I think it would make<br>
anybody else who hasn't read the essay think that.<br>
<p>
When I read "dynamic optimism", I think of my last CEO, who always believed<br>
the company would start making pots of money "next year" (it still hasn't).<br>
 His optimism (here in the wishful thinking sense) certainly dynamically<br>
adjusted to the vicissitudes of reality.  ;-)<br>
