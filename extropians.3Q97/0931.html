you really should read that "Valley of the Nerds" article, I posted the http<br>
address for it a while back but you can just netsearch for it, a few<br>
different pages have it posted... it really does bring up some interesting<br>
points and names some big names in the computer industry as psychedelic<br>
users... according to the article the founder of Lotus Corp. says that his<br>
business plan wouldn't exist as it does without the use of recreational<br>
chemicals... another example in the article is a programmer in silicon<br>
valley, who was stuck on a problem for quite some time then did some<br>
psychedelic drug and while under the influence was able to solve the<br>
problem... psychedelic drugs are tools, it all depends on how you use<br>
them... anyone can pick up a paint brush, not everyone can paint...<br>
basically the way I see it is that psychedelic drugs make people think in<br>
ways that you normally don't, it's like natural selection, psychedelics<br>
cause mutated thoughts, which usually are worthless, just like any mutation,<br>
but occasionally there's the one mutant idea that is revoultionary... just<br>
like the mutation that gave fish feet... most of all psychedelics are<br>
definitely not for everyone, and for the most part warp your mind... but it<br>
really is in how you use them, and to say that they are worthless,<br>
specifically in western ideals is a sad deception... I am a technofile, I<br>
consider my self an extropian, and being an atheist am not very spiritual...<br>
but to say there's nothing to psychedelics, and to call cultures that use<br>
psychedelics failures because they don't have gadgets is really an<br>
expression of xenophobic ignorance... ok I'm rambling (not like that stops<br>
many of you) but that's quite enough for now, so to sum it up, <br>
<p>
PSYCHEDELICS - NOT FOR EVERYONE BUT YOU DON'T SEE ME WISHING ALL THE<br>
STRAITEDGE PEOPLE WOULD LEAVE THE LIST SO DON'T WISH THAT UPON US 'FUZZY<br>
HEADED' ONES <br>
<p>
and also read that article... psychedelics did have an impact on the<br>
computer industry... sure most sys admins and clean livers, but really sys<br>
admins and engineer really aren't shit, it's the R&amp;D people, innovators,<br>
pioneers that impact the industry and among them use of psychedlics is<br>
higher in proportion than to the rest of western society, no I don't have<br>
any numbers or statistics, just what I've seen and people I know... ok yes<br>
I'm still rambling... bis spater all<br>
