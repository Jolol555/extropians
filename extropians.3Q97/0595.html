<i>&gt; &gt;There will, I believe, come a point in my life when I choose to raise a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;child with a (female) partner of my choice; and it is highly likely that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;she will bear the child. This being the case, and my being</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;spermatozoically-challenged (the current PC phrase, I suspect), does anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;have any hard facts about the possibility of my genes being used to replace</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;those in the sperm of an anonymous donor, resulting in a child of which I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;am a true parent?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I should add to this that any material from my body cannot come from an</i><br>
<i>&gt; ovum, it must come from a normal cell.</i><br>
<p>
If you have no ova, then the likelihood of you and a female partner<br>
parenting a child is not likely in the near future.  Cloning you<br>
entirely is probably within reach, next will come the ability for<br>
two ova to fertilize each other (say your partner and your mother<br>
or sister).  But something on your side has to undergo meiosis, and<br>
that currently only happens in ova, so the prospect for that is<br>
further off (but surprizes do happen).<br>
<p>
Of course, you can easily--even legally--today, have a child with 50%<br>
of your partner's genes, 25% of yours, and 25% of your ancestors' by<br>
having your partner inseminated by your brother or father.<br>
<p>
And as for that "true parent" quote, I tend to reject the idea that<br>
DNA has anything at all to do with parenting.<br>
