Yeah, your point about the Belt is the main reason why I'm<br>
guessing that Orion was named before Canis Major, which with<br>
the exception of Sirius is not a very impressive constellation<br>
from northern latitudes (I wonder how it looks from Australia,<br>
where it gets high in the sky?).  The story about the hunting<br>
dogs could easily have been tacked on as an afterthought.<br>
<p>
But I've read a bunch of different people's opinions (can't remember<br>
cites offhand, sorry) that the bright-star constellations of the<br>
zodiac are far and away the oldest.  The planets, which move from<br>
night to night, are much more eye-catching even than Orion's belt,<br>
and so the stars Regulus, Spica, and Antares (which make frequent<br>
lovely and eyecatching "conjunctions" with the planets as they<br>
pass) and their constellations were for this reason probably among<br>
the first to be named.  I have a book in which they list, among<br>
other things, all the constellations mentioned in the Old Testament<br>
and in Homer (they only mention a few, and Homer does the better<br>
of the two), and there's also a bit of evidence about which<br>
constellations the Sumerians wrote about as well.<br>
<p>
(Oh, the title of the book is THE CAMBRIDGE GUIDE TO THE<br>
CONSTELLATIONS, if I'm remembering right.  Recommended to<br>
anyone who is into this stuff. Also has the lists of the 200<br>
nearest stars, and things like that.)<br>
