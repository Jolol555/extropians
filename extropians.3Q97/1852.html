<i>&gt;So...I have come up with an alternative...which I would like critiqued.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I was in the same room with a TV a week or so ago...rare occurence....The Tv</i><br>
<i>&gt;was on to an "infomercial"....one of those (you guessed it) exercise</i><br>
<i>&gt;machines.  This particular one was something called (I think) the Western</i><br>
<i>&gt;Flyer.(it said something about a web-site?)  It was billed as an alternative</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the Health Rider ..."why ride when you can FLY!!"  Naturally all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;models were in wonderful shape ...mostly female...and incredibly sexy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But I keep thinking about it. &lt;infectous memes&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That machine seemed very cool to me too. I asked the director of my health<br>
center about it or anything like it, and she said that she goes to all the<br>
conventions and seminars and so forth and has never seen anything like it.<br>
But I decided I wanted to get it anyway and tried to find their website. It<br>
didn't exist under anything like the name they mentioned, so I gave up on<br>
it. But I look forward to a "flying" machine like this becoming available.<br>
