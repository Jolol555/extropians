Um, well, the standard trick question posed to a demon offering three<br>
wishes (or even one) is this: `Kindly satisfy every wish I utter<br>
henceforth' (see, e.g., STRIPED HOLES, by yr hmble &amp; obdt svt).  Some have<br>
supposed that the toxic self-reference of this instruction voids the<br>
guarantee.  In the case of an AI/nano genie, however, its effectiveness can<br>
be taken for granted, except that the explicit statement of one's wishes is<br>
not required and their content would be unnecessarily limited in any case.<br>
