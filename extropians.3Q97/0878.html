Well, the Aquatic Ape theory holds that.  However, there's really no reason<br>
the aquatic phase had to be then.  The aquatic phase could have been between<br>
Habilis and Erectus, or between Erectus and us.  There could have been<br>
multiple aquatic phases, for that matter.  AAT wants to explain bipedalism<br>
via an aquatic existence but that's hardly the only way to explain<br>
bipedalism.  <br>
<p>
Indeed, the gracile bone structure that distinguishes us from other hominids<br>
is rather a mystery, but if we were semi-aquatic and the other hominids<br>
weren't, it would at least serve some purpose.  We don't know whether other<br>
hominids had any of the other purported aquatic adaptations, such as<br>
hairlessness, sweating, subcutaneous fat, or a diving reflex; there's none<br>
left.  I understand there's evidence that Erectus was quite a runner, though,<br>
and that would make one expect sweating at least.<br>
