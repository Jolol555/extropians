On the Foresight Exchange on-line game (nee Robin Hanson's Idea Futures),<br>
I created a claim for people to bet on the date that the Feynman Grand<br>
Prize will be awarded by the Foresight Institute (no relation to the<br>
Foresight Exchange).<br>
<p>
This prize requires the design and construction of 32 copies each of<br>
two nanotech devices: a robot arm capable of .1 nanometer positional<br>
accuracy which fits within a 100 nm cube, and a computational device,<br>
an 8-bit binary adder, which fits within a 50 nm cube.<br>
<p>
I would guess that meeting the required .1 nanometer positional accuracy<br>
for the robot arm will be difficult with protein based assemblers.<br>
.1 nm is about the size of a hydrogen atom.  Without knowing much about<br>
the stiffnesses involved, it seems likely that a protein based system<br>
will have more slop in it than that.<br>
<p>
There may also be some difficulty in building the adder out of proteins.<br>
50 nm is not all that big.  Ribosomes are about 25 nm in diameter and<br>
although what they do is important, they are basically enzymes which<br>
catalyze the assembly of amino acids.  As far as is known they have no<br>
moving parts.  Ribosomes presumably had to be that big in order to get<br>
the active sites shaped the way they had to be.  So it is questionable<br>
whether you could build an 8 bit adder out of proteins in a 50 nm cube.<br>
<p>
Based on this I think that awarding the Feynman Grand Prize will require<br>
progress beyond proteinoid nanotech, to something similar to diamond.<br>
<p>
The claim on the FX game has not been very heavily played, a dozen<br>
shares changing hands every couple of months.  But for what it's worth,<br>
the date predicted by the players has hovered around 2025-2030.  So if<br>
we get a simple form of nanotech in the late 2010's, to pick the magic<br>
"twenty years off" where breakthroughs always seem to hover, this would<br>
suggest another 10 years or so to produce diamondoid nanotech or<br>
something similar.<br>
