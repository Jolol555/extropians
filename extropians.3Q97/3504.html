                A Liberal Democratic Representative Open Society<br>
                -----------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
FOREWORD<br>
========<br>
<p>
    In Classical Greece, the Agora was the public place where free <br>
citizens met spontaneously to transact public business, to trade, and to <br>
exchange news, views and information.  Increasingly, our world is becoming <br>
an Agora (or a series of interrelated Agoras across different <br>
cross-sections of society)).<br>
<p>
     Liberals, individualists, democratic socialists, social democrats,<br>
free-marketeers, classical liberals, conservatives, anarchists and others <br>
of no party may all find some merit in these ideas.  They outline entirely<br>
feasible arrangements for an Open Society affording variety and freedom of<br>
choice, as well as more nearly spontaneous orders in political services.<br>
These would be social, but not statist.  Democratic Agorism can operate in<br>
whole or in part, and in any country.<br>
<p>
    Democratic Agorism is very practical (and eminently practicable).  All<br>
elements of each of the proposals are presently in use somewhere, and can<br>
therefore be studied, evaluated, compared, criticised and discussed.  The<br>
purpose of Democratic Agorism is to make available the best opportunities <br>
for citizens qua electors with differing preferences to choose, support <br>
and benefit from representation and programmes which most nearly fulfil <br>
their requirements and wishes.  As well, people will enjoy increased <br>
freedom to make their own arrangements for a better life with the funds <br>
which are made available.<br>
<p>
    (These proposals should -- I hope! -- appeal to everyone, except <br>
perhaps for those seeking power over other people, or those wanting a<br>
highly-stratified 'verticalist' society where a few are rich beyond dreams of<br>
avarice, whilst the many suffer from poverty and the denial of access to<br>
life-chances.  <br>
<p>
        American writer Jerry Pournelle in his essay 'The World As It <br>
Could Be Made', in Dr. Robert Prehoda's "Your Next Fifty Years" [1980], <br>
has pointed out that some people deliberately opt for poverty (for other <br>
people), because they dislike seeing other people living as free,<br>
independent, self-confident individuals).<br>
<p>
<p>
                        THE PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED<br>
                        -------------------------<br>
<p>
    How can we provide maximal individual freedom (both positive _and_<br>
negative: freedom-to-act as well as freedom-from-coercion) to each and <br>
every individual, so that we may live our lives more nearly as we wish? <br>
And how do we enable ourselves to enjoy access to the widest range of <br>
'life-chances'?<br>
<p>
<p>
    How can we ensure that -- in the rapidly-transforming world economy --<br>
people can look forward to (and choose) a future human environment which <br>
is worth having?<br>
<p>
<p>
    And how can we make sure that everyone has a real incentive to choose <br>
the best systems providing opportunities for maximal economic growth? <br>
Insofar as economic systems are 'Wertfrei' (value-free) abstract games, as <br>
the economists tell us, people have the right to choose the most <br>
favourable 'game', and to receive full payment for their consent to the <br>
game's taking place.  Too often, some neoconservatives and others take the <br>
_particular_  game (and its income and property distributions) for <br>
granted, as a -- somehow -- given 'background'.  Not so.  As Robert Nozick <br>
points out, the better-off tend to be the descendants of the beneficiaries <br>
of past injustices, while the less-well-off tend to be the descendants of <br>
their predecessors' victims.  Justly-due restitution is not <br>
'confiscation', nor is it redistribution either.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     The monopoly supply of "public" services by the state, which (in<br>
democratic theory and principle at least) we as the electorate "hire" to<br>
improve society by solving various problems for us -- and the consequent<br>
disputes over which services are to be supplied, by whom, under whose<br>
control, by which criteria, how and in what quantity, and at what cost --<br>
is problematic.<br>
<p>
<p>
    One purpose of these proposals is to outline the possibilities and<br>
advantages of simultaneously-available, pluralistic, more nearly <br>
market-like arrangements, which will expand and enhance the range and <br>
quality of social services.  And this should happen in ways which are <br>
consistent with the best  features of representative democracy and the <br>
better, more responsive forms of non-profit voluntary groups and <br>
for-profit commercial enterprises.  The implementation of these systems <br>
can be realised gradually, and will be easier for people to put into <br>
practice, and adjust to, than many proposed transitions to more fully free <br>
arrangements.<br>
<p>
<p>
    Democratic Agorism owes much of its inspiration to the late Agorist<br>
theoretician Robert LeFevre and to the late Karl Popper.  To Robert <br>
LeFevre it owes the insight that there is no basis for property rights <br>
which does not entail the possible initiation of aggression to assert <br>
those rights -- which aggression is morally forbidden to consistent <br>
individualist anarchists, or indeed anyone morally or practically opposed <br>
to the initiating of aggression.<br>
<p>
<p>
    I see no viable alternative to Milton Friedman's view, expressed in <br>
"Capitalism and Freedom":  "Just what constitutes property and what rights <br>
the ownership of property confers are complex social creations rather than <br>
self-evident propositions."<br>
<p>
<p>
    To Karl Popper is owed his analysis of the achievement of <br>
intellectual, moral and practical advance by means of the Open Society of <br>
free and democratic institutions.  'Democracy' to Popper means the ability <br>
to change the governing order without violence; and -- to this end --<br>
for people to be free to hypothesize, research, discuss and advance <br>
proposals for improving the ways people live.<br>
<p>
<p>
    Any free society must ultimately depend on the broad assent of its <br>
citizens, which can only be practically demonstrated by democratic <br>
arrangememts.  Even in an anarchy, people might prefer to have a vote on <br>
the system they live within...<br>
<p>
<p>
The essential elements of Demopcratic Agorism are modular and synergistic:<br>
<p>
They include:<br>
<p>
[A]  A contractually-based day-by-day electoral system - Vectored Politics<br>
[B]  Full-Liability Personal Indemnity Insurance, enabling full restitution.<br>
[C]  Personal Radio Alarms: for event-driven and customer-driven policing<br>
[D]  A Restitutive Legal System, with online 'courts' and arbitration.<br>
[E]  Good Basic Income Provision for all -- independent incomes for all.<br>
[F]  Networked information services and library facilities<br>
[G]  National Health Insurance chargecard and online diagnostic facilities<br>
[H]  Online education and skills-development facilities<br>
[I]  Tradenet buy/sell/swap/finance/work  transaction services<br>
[J]  Packaged 'political' services provided via elected representatives<br>
<p>
<p>
     It has been estimated (David Friedman's Law, in his 'The Machinery of<br>
Freedom', 2nd edition) that state services typically produce about one half<br>
the value to consumers of voluntary (non-profit or for-profit) provision, at<br>
up to twice the cost.  He also espouses Robert LeFevre's Agorist ideas:<br>
<p>
        "My own preference is for the sort of economic institutions which <br>
have been named, I think by Robert LeFevre, agoric.  Under agoric <br>
institutions almost everyone is self-employed.  Instead of corporations, <br>
there are large groups of entrepreneurs related by trade, not by <br>
authority.  Each sells, not his time, but what his time produces.  As a <br>
freelance writer (one of my occupations), I am part of an agoric economic <br>
order."  [1st ed. p. 199, [1973] and [1978]].<br>
<p>
      A two- to four-fold misallocation rate may be an over-estimate; <br>
still, the costs of misallocated resources, conflict, inflation, excessive <br>
regulation, waste, bureaucracy, maltreatment and lost opportunities are <br>
not always amenable to precise estimation, but they have certainly lowered <br>
living standards for most people.  The problem to be solved is that of <br>
making funds available for different purposes for people to make good use <br>
of, by their own lights,  with the fullest possible informed consent of <br>
those participating in generating the funds..<br>
<p>
<p>
         CHOOSING REPRESENTATION: BOLD STROKES AND INCREMENTAL CHANGES<br>
         -------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
     Rather than having periodic general elections, with very limited <br>
choice as to candidates, each elector is at any time free to choose any <br>
person of his or her preference (who must of course be willing so to act), <br>
to be his or her elected representative, always on a revokeable basis. <br>
Each day is a possible 'Election Day' for each elector and each <br>
representative.<br>
<p>
<p>
    Representatives can then delegate their work-load as they see fit, to<br>
those they have confidence in.  In this age of easy communications, there<br>
need be no restriction on the total number of elected representatives <br>
meeting in Assembly by means of electronic and tele- conferencing.  The <br>
emphasis shifts from 'winners and losers' to 'market shares.'<br>
<p>
<p>
    The relationship between elector and representative is a standard<br>
civil-law contractual one (offer -&gt; acceptance -&gt; performance (-&gt; <br>
payment)).  Representatives may form mutual-interest groups, which might <br>
in some respects approximate the present political coalitions.  New <br>
patterns of support will emerge.  They will not be beholden to political <br>
parties.  Elections will cease to be periodic all-or-nothing affairs, and <br>
will reflect and accommodate  gradual shifts in opinion and support, as <br>
electors change and develop their preferences between representatives - <br>
and their policies - over time.<br>
<p>
<p>
     (A variant of modern public-key/private-key security cryptosystems <br>
can easily be arranged, to ensure a secret ballot for those preferring <br>
such an arrangement.  It should be pointed out that most of the present<br>
'secret-ballot' electoral systems are only as 'secret' as the authorities<br>
running them want them to be).<br>
<p>
<p>
     The legislative functions of the elected assembly will be carried out <br>
by means of the representatives voting on measures, each casting that <br>
number of votes corresponding to the sum of contracting electors they <br>
represent at the time of the vote.  Public laws would require the assent <br>
of a real majority -- preferably  at least 50% of the electorate's votes <br>
(after subtracting 'votes-against' from 'votes-for').  I expect this to <br>
result in many fewer -- and clearer -- statute laws.<br>
<p>
<p>
    It should be worthwhile to introduce 'sunset' review provisions for<br>
existing legislation, (as distinct from the body of civil law), so that<br>
pre-existing legislation (much of which is dated, inappropriate, corrupt <br>
in origin, harmful or poorly-thought-out) will be subject to review and <br>
re-enactment or repeal.<br>
<p>
<p>
    A Written Constitution, setting out the basic principles of universal<br>
human rights -- to facilitate formal and legal enforceability of those <br>
rights by means of accessible _trial by jury_ -- is both educational and<br>
advantageous for liberty, with entrenching clauses barring attacks on key<br>
individual rights and liberties, and forbidding cruel or unusual <br>
punishments,  and so on.  Every country in the world _nominally_ <br>
subscribes to these principles already, in the 1947 Universal Declaration <br>
of Human Rights:<br>
<p>
        <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/UDHR48.html">http://www.hri.org/docs/UDHR48.html</a><br>
<p>
   It is usually easier to convince people (and governments) that they <br>
should observe what they've already actually assented to.<br>
<p>
<p>
     Representatives may go on to appoint an Executive to deal with <br>
defence matters, external affairs and so on.  There may also be a second<br>
(non-spending) oversight and revision chamber, or Senate, with<br>
representatives especially chosen for their wisdom, knowledge, character,<br>
standing and so on - as electors and their representatives may wish.<br>
<p>
<p>
     For the honest and ethical political representatives, there are many <br>
advantages to be had from Democratic Agorism, and few disadvantages.  Each <br>
can work to build up their electoral constituency ('market share'), and to <br>
offer the most attractive and worthwhile programmes, to ensure ongoing <br>
support and revenue.  Each can look forward to promoting their preferred <br>
objectives.  Each can have some security from the domination of party, <br>
leader or faction.  Every shade of opinion can be proportionally <br>
represented.<br>
<p>
<p>
   For the elector, the available opportunities will be very considerably<br>
improved over the present unresponsive legislatures and government<br>
monopolies.  There will be a whole new series of market-places, offering<br>
packaged choices of services with strong incentives to be efficient and<br>
attractive.  Programmes compete for electoral support on a basis which<br>
facilitated comparison for quality and value over time.  The existence of <br>
a variety of simultaneously available alternatives will considerably <br>
enhance individual freedoms and reduce social conflicts arising from <br>
monopoly provision.<br>
<p>
<p>
    It should be noted that Democratic agorism can be built up gradually <br>
(or even covertly, or clandestinely) in non-democratic societies, so as to <br>
supplant and replace undemocratic systems by more representative - hence <br>
more legitimate - fully democratic ones.  <br>
<p>
<p>
    And Democratic Agorism provides very useful 'benchmarks' against which <br>
any existing social arrangements and situations may be appraised.  "What <br>
would be happening in this situation within the parameters of Democratic <br>
Agorism?"<br>
<p>
<p>
       INSURING JUSTICE: CRIME PREVENTION, COMPENSATION AND RESTITUTION<br>
       ----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
     The maintenance and furtherance of individual liberties, and the<br>
prevention of criminal acts (violence, coercion, malicious damage and the<br>
deliberate infliction of harm), and provision of full compensation or<br>
restitution for anyone who has suffered loss or injury, are the moral and<br>
logical functions of a rational and humane justice system which is founded <br>
on principles of delegated self-defence and equality of protection within <br>
the Rule of Law.<br>
<p>
<p>
    Most people who have suffered from crime would rather receive full and<br>
prompt compensation, than only the remote and uncertain possibility that <br>
the actual malefactor might be caught and perhaps punished.  In the past, <br>
the problem has been that offenders have been unable to compensate their <br>
victims adequately.  It is time to return the protection of the law from <br>
the abstraction of "state" to the reality of persons.<br>
<p>
     Consequently, if each person and association is required to hold<br>
public liability insurance (reinsured for complete reliability), full<br>
compensation could always be made available to recompense anyone who has<br>
suffered loss or who has been harmed.  An arrangement similar to the Motor<br>
Agents Bureau Agreement in the UK would also operate, to ensure <br>
compensation from a 'pooled' fund under all circumstances (i.e. if the <br>
offender cannot be immediately found).  <br>
<p>
     This insurance would be very inexpensive for people who do not harm <br>
other people.<br>
<p>
<p>
     (Further, if each citizen is offered or provided with a miniaturized<br>
radio emergency alarm, preset to transmit a uniquely-coded personalized alarm<br>
signal which could be triangulated for exact source position location and<br>
identification, then rapid-response medical, legal, police and rescue<br>
services could be made immediately available on demand.  This would also help<br>
greatly to deter malefactors, improve peoples' sense of safety, reduce the<br>
costs of crime, and assist the prompt arrest of the actual offenders).<br>
<p>
<p>
     The basic principles and procedures of English Common Law _can_ <br>
(among other systems of law) provide a basis for sensible adjudication <br>
services, provided that there are much better administrative arrangements <br>
to assure the ready availability of arbitration in civil courts at _no <br>
cost_ to the participants.  <br>
<p>
      However, as Hayek and others have pointed out, the English Common <br>
Law needs extensive revision to correct the unfortunate results of judges <br>
over the centuries having been drawn from a social class made up of <br>
creditors rather than debtors, landlords rather than tenants, masters <br>
rather than servants, vendors rather than customers.  It might be added, <br>
that there has been a warping of the law caused by the ascendancy in the <br>
courts of those with deep pockets and the option of patience resulting in <br>
case-by-case decisions.<br>
<p>
    In a restitutive paradigm, the costs of crime would be more accurately<br>
appraised and obvious; insurers and others would have incentives to <br>
restrain the incidence of - and thus reduce the costs of - infractions.<br>
<p>
<p>
    Personal security and property protection costs, including national<br>
defence provision, can be funded by a 'ring-fenced' pro-rata tax on all<br>
personal property and wealth owned, so that protection can be more nearly<br>
fairly priced according to the worth of the holdings which are being<br>
protected.  In the UK this might approximate 1% of the value of all <br>
property holdings per annum.  Policing services may be pluralistic -- <br>
those performing policing functions should have no special privileges.<br>
<p>
<p>
                       PLURAL SOCIAL WELFARE SERVICES<br>
                       ------------------------------<br>
<p>
     Modern governments take up to 50% of GDP in costs and taxes.  These<br>
government revenues will be redistributed in equal shares to all electors <br>
(a 'social dividend' or 'Basic Income'); and a share therof could be <br>
redirected by them to their representatives as their electors wish. <br>
Representatives will thus receive funds in direct proportion to the <br>
numbers of electors supporting them, enabling them to finance the <br>
programmes they undertake to provide for their electors and others.<br>
<p>
      Or the elector may elect to receive the funds intact.<br>
<p>
     Each elector will likely choose the representative whose range of <br>
programmes and legislative stance best meets their preferences for <br>
representation, and  for possible provision of personal social services <br>
(health, education, additional income etc.: the present "public" <br>
services).  To ease the transition, and to allow reconsideration and <br>
amendment as and if problems are found, the funds may be transferred from <br>
government to electors gradually, over - say - a three-year period.<br>
<p>
    Representatives may offer various mixes of "local" and "national"<br>
services.  Some representatives will offer services directed more to <br>
helping the disadvantaged, while others would be directed more towards <br>
enhancing the life-chances of the elector.<br>
<p>
<p>
    In the UK at present (1996), under these arrangements, around seven<br>
thousand UK pounds per elector per annum is available from an equal-shares<br>
reapportionment of total tax revenues, and their return to the elector, <br>
with another fifteen hundred UK pounds available for each child.  This <br>
should be more than sufficient to cover the great majority of electors' <br>
situations.  It would provide a family income of seventeen thousand UK <br>
pounds per annum for a mother, father and two children, before any <br>
additional income is earned.  This amount should also constitute the <br>
Personal Income Tax Allowance.<br>
<p>
<p>
    A flat-rate yearly risk-sharing national medical-expenses insurance <br>
premium of around four hundred UK pounds should be sufficient to cover all <br>
medical expenses (including disability and geriatric care expenses), by <br>
funding a risk-sharing Universal Health Insurance chargecard for each <br>
citizen, which is used to settle voluntary-sector bona fide treatment <br>
charges for bona fide illnesses (thus enabling funds to 'follow the <br>
patient').<br>
<p>
<p>
                           A NETWORKING SOCIETY<br>
                           --------------------<br>
<p>
    Each elector's household will be provided with an easy-to-use on-line<br>
communications keyboard/terminal connecting to their TV set (or as they<br>
wish), to enable access to a wide variety of services and facilities.<br>
Network connections will be via the public telephone system (PSTN) at no<br>
charge, or via a national hard-wired or fibre-optical data highway, with<br>
data-radio facilities provided where there is no existing wired <br>
connection.  (Handicapped people unable to use the equipment properly can <br>
of course be helped to do so, by their friends and relatives, <br>
representatives, healthcare professionals and volunteers, neighbours and <br>
others).  Voice input is now readily available for those preferring it.<br>
<p>
<p>
    Network services will include:- electronic mail; news; selecting and<br>
appointing democratic representatives; conflict investigation, resolution <br>
and legal ajudication services and arbitration facilities; travel <br>
facilities; medical diagnosis and treatment outcome information services; <br>
educational facilities; employment and trading opportunities; consumer <br>
information and advice; housing opportunities; library and information <br>
resources; social events and community facilities; financial services; and <br>
many other resources.<br>
<p>
<p>
            EMERGENCY MEDICAL, POLICE, FIRE &amp; RESCUE SERVICES<br>
            =================================================<br>
<p>
    It is now technically and economically possible to provide each and <br>
every citizen with a uniquely coded personal miniature radio 'panic' <br>
alarm.  When activated _by the citizen_ in an emergency situation, the <br>
unit transmits a coded signal which identifies the citizen and their <br>
location, and summons immediate assistance to those GPS coordinates.  This <br>
can be medical, policing, fire brigade or other disaster ssistance.  The <br>
signal can be instantly triangulated to pinpoint its source, and Global <br>
Positioning Coordinates provided, so that emergency rescue service<br>
can be provided by the fastest available route.  This would substantially<br>
reduce the incidence of crime, and reduce its cost to individuals.<br>
<p>
<p>
SUMMARY<br>
=======<br>
<p>
     The sought-for advantages of the systems proposed here include:<br>
<p>
[ 1] Improved responsiveness &amp; responsibility of those elected or appointed<br>
[ 2] Reduced deficit spending, less inflationary money-printing &amp; borrowing<br>
[ 3] Funds go to those programmes which those paying actually approve of<br>
[ 4] Reduced forward commitment of future revenue resources<br>
[ 5] Channelling of chosen kinds of help to those chosen to be helped<br>
[ 6] Social acquisitions by persons and groups rather than nationalisation<br>
[ 7] More variety, better value-for-money, less "red-tape", wasted resources<br>
[ 8] New employment opportunities and service industries<br>
[ 9] Better allocations as between local and national services<br>
[10] Incremental change rather than "U-turns", with better adaptation<br>
[11] More nearly market-like, with multiple simultaneous choices<br>
[12] Smaller, less monolithic administrative bureaucracies<br>
[13] Better opportunities for involvement for those wanting to participate<br>
[14] Less bitter rivalry when all "sides" can win; not a zero-sum situation<br>
[15] Maybe a political currency for spending in the political marketplace<br>
[16] Resolution of Kenneth Arrow's voting Impossibility Theorem<br>
[17] Resolution of Condorcet's voting Paradox<br>
[18] Encouragement of individualism &amp; responsible voluntaryist co-operation<br>
[19] Encouragement of new thinking in policy formulation and presentation.<br>
<p>
<p>
AFTERWORD<br>
=========<br>
<p>
     From longer-term free-society perspectives, these ideas offer good<br>
prospects for building up a broad range of free and independent groups and<br>
social institutions providing personal and welfare services, each largely<br>
funded by its own supporters.  Representatives would progress by <br>
fulfilling their electors' requirements.  The struggle for political <br>
advantage or domination would be replaced by more constructive activity <br>
more nearly voluntarily-based.  Rather than the usual futile or <br>
domineering zero-sum and negative-sum political struggles, just about <br>
everyone could win.<br>
<p>
<p>
     There would be more participation in worthwhile ongoing activities, <br>
and better understanding of the virtues and advantages of a more fully <br>
free society.  Representatives would be more accountable, and electors <br>
would have incentives to be responsible.  The redistributive elements of <br>
revenue-sharing and apportionment would become more obvious and more <br>
nearly subject to rational and humane considerations.  Poorer people <br>
frequently bear a disproportionate burden of 'social costs.'<br>
<p>
<p>
( This presentation is an outline of some ideas for a more fully free <br>
liberal and democratic free society; it may also help provide a better <br>
understanding of freely-chosen plural social welfare provision.  Written <br>
comment is always welcome. -TH   19 June [1977] ).<br>
