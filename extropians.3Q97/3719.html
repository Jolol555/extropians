Anton, I hope you're not still upset about my 'gun-control' post of several<br>
weeks ago. I do not think we're going to agree on this soon, but I respect<br>
your position.<br>
<p>
The reason I didn't mention Shining Path scum was that I did not have<br>
accurate data on them. In this particular case I agree with you that<br>
allowing the peasants to defend themselves could help to some extend.<br>
Personally I would have prefered the Peruvian Army hunting them down but<br>
that seemed non-feasable.<br>
<p>
Maoists are among the worst political fanatics the world has ever known,<br>
right up there with another one whose-name-I-won't-mention. Their leader<br>
said on various occasions that killing 90% of the Peruvian population would<br>
be acceptable if that's what it would take to gain power. They finally<br>
caught him a few years back. One down, many to go...<br>
