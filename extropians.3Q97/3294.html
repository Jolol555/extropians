Hi!<br>
<p>
My question is simple, is really cryopreservation an answer to achieve<br>
immortality?<br>
<p>
Let's suppose that I die (not that I'm counting on it!) and endure<br>
cryopreservation.<br>
<p>
The damage done to the cells (or to the neurons which is what really<br>
matters) during the freezing process is noticeable, many will be<br>
destroyed in the process not to mention the cells that will be damaged<br>
while I'm not frizzed. If I'm old, I have already lost many<br>
neurons and many others would have severe damage.<br>
<p>
The bigger amount of damage would come from the time I would be in<br>
cryopreservation. I don't have a clue to how much would that be but<br>
we're talking about 50, 100, 200, 500 years! Even more damage is done to<br>
the cells.<br>
<p>
In the future, some guys unfreeze my head, probably put it on a new body<br>
and start <br>
working on putting me back to life. The answer would be nanotechnology<br>
to repair the<br>
damage in my brain cells.<br>
<p>
Here's my problem, they won't know how the cells were when I died, so<br>
they will just follow a blueprint of 'standard brains' to repair me. My<br>
problem is that, depending on the extent of the damage, I will no longer<br>
be me! I will be a different person because my brain will be changed. I<br>
(or my other me, since that person will no longer be me) might have some<br>
memories of how I used to be but I will be another person.<br>
<p>
What do you think of this?<br>
<p>
Personally, I'm 19 years old. So, statistically speaking, I have more<br>
than 50 years to find a cure for aging.<br>
<p>
This reminds me of an interesting problem I once argued about, let's<br>
suppose that scientists find a way to transpose a person to another<br>
distant place, almost instantly.<br>
<p>
Of course that one's molecules would have to be disorganized and a mass<br>
of one's molecules would be formed. This mass would then go to the other<br>
place in a few seconds and the molecules would, again, be arranged so<br>
that the body of the person would be a body again, a super computer<br>
would know the exact positions of each atom so that the person who left<br>
location A would be exactly in the same conditions is location B.<br>
<p>
Do you think this is the same person who left or is another?<br>
<p>
Complicating the situation, I could say that some atoms would not be<br>
exactly in the same position but the health of the person would not be<br>
affected. Now, is this the same person who left location A?<br>
<p>
What about if some atoms are replaced but the positions remain the same?<br>
What if some atoms are replaced and some positions changed? What if all<br>
atoms are changed but the positions are the same? Remember that for<br>
everyone else this person is always the same no matter how many atoms<br>
you replace. I'm atheist so I don't believe much in souls but I think<br>
some of this questions are interesting.<br>
<p>
Enough of divagation,<br>
<p>
    Hasta la vista...<br>
