 IAN: If the basis for the meteor theory is <br>
 witness accounts of a fiery object streaking <br>
 toward TWA 800, then the meteor account is<br>
 without basis once we are familiar with<br>
 the details of witness accounts.<br>
<p>
 I have spoken with several witnesses in detail.<br>
 I have collected almost 30 detailed accounts.<br>
 The primary reasons to discount the meteor <br>
 theory based upon the preponderance of <br>
 witness accounts are:<br>
<p>
  1) pilots with the advantage of having<br>
  a higher point of view saw the object<br>
  rise up from the surface of the earth.<br>
<p>
  2) the curved nature of the trajectory <br>
  of the missile-like object [1]<br>
<p>
  3) the diminution in the observed <br>
  size &amp; width of the flame and "exhaust <br>
  trail" as the streak approached TWA 800,<br>
  which indicates that the fiery object <br>
  was going away from observes. In fact, <br>
  many say that it became small that it <br>
  vanished just before the first explosion.<br>
<p>
  4) the wreckage shows no sign of <br>
  penetration caused by a projectile<br>
  on a downward trajectory [2] <br>
<p>
 One witness, Tom Dougherty, to whom <br>
 I spoke at length and to whom I raised <br>
 the possibility of a meteor (to which <br>
 he said "no way"), indicated that the<br>
 streaking object not only curved in<br>
 its overall trajectory but about 1/3<br>
 of the way up, took a sudden sharp<br>
 turn and then "corrected itself."<br>
<p>
 I posit that at that moment the missile's<br>
 guidance system temporarily locked onto  <br>
 its target drone, but then reselected <br>
 the larger target/signal, TWA 800. <br>
 This may have been that drone: [3].<br>
