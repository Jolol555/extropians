<i>&gt;Without recognizing what we do, [without being "conscious" of</i><br>
doing it] &gt;most of us make language fixed,<br>
<i>&gt;and use it as a criterion for "what makes sense" rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt;allowing our senses (and our sensory extensions, such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;microscopes, voltmeters, etc.) to declare what "makes sense" and</i><br>
<i>&gt;adapting our language to express what we sense.</i><br>
<p>
I would add that the symbology of language has a "cookie cutter"<br>
effect upon our perceptions of "reality." Whenever we use a word, <br>
it encapsolates the concept of certain piece of "reality." <br>
<p>
But once a certain word creates a certain "cookie cut," in most <br>
people it becomes a static phenomenom. As a result, a certain <br>
perception becomes ingrained,essentially creating a "perceptual<br>
rut." <br>
<p>
This leads to static thinking; that is, people end up<br>
only being able to think about things one way - which is dictated<br>
by the words they use. Once a "mental rut" has been created <br>
by the association between a word and some aspect of "reality,"<br>
that word can be used to create an almost Pavlovian effect<br>
in people who are not semantically astute. This is how<br>
propoganda is done. And I believe that this is a major part <br>
of what the NSPIC thread is about.<br>
<p>
As Richard Plourde pointed out in his message, a far more <br>
pragmatic technique is to approach words as symbols that are<br>
flexible in meaning. Since all words are mearly **approximate**<br>
descriptors of "reality," as we learn more about "reality," <br>
those old approximations become obsolete, and thus we must come    <br>
up with new symbols (words/terminology) to better represent<br>
our new perceptions of "reality." This is why each scientific <br>
field comes up with new terminology specific to their field -<br>
Being a specialist provides a more precise perception of "reality"<br>
that requires more precise symbols (language/terms).<br>
<p>
One commonly refered to example of using more precise words is<br>
how eskimos have 12 different words to describe "snow."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Once language gets recognized as a symbology, and a symbology not</i><br>
<i>&gt;inherently able to represent all relationships that we can</i><br>
<i>&gt;characterize, then the need for a revised and extended symbology</i><br>
<i>&gt;becomes evident </i><br>
<p>
This is part of the point I wanted to make in my previous paragraph.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;-- **unless we fall into the all-too-common trap of</i><br>
<i>&gt;assuming that if our language doesn't cover it, it ain't there.**</i><br>
[emphasis added]<br>
<p>
I think this a major obstacle to all areas of human advancement.<br>
We get stuck in semantic traps that prevent us from becoming<br>
conscious of new solutions. **WE CAN'T LET OUR WORDS DICTATE<br>
OUR PERCEPTIONS.**<br>
<p>
A related but seperate topic is that the meaning for all symbols<br>
(and therefore all words) is subjective. That is, symbols only<br>
have meaning in a person's brain, and only because an individual<br>
assigns a certain meaning to a symbol. If the word "tree" means<br>
a tall wooden brown thing with leaves to me, it only means that<br>
because I give it that meaning *for me*.<br>
<p>
Language is possible only because people agree (to a certain extent)<br>
on what various symbols represent. That is how dictionaries are created.<br>
Dictionary makers do massive public research to see what all the various<br>
symbols (words) mean to a large number of the population, and that<br>
becomes the "concensous meaning" for a word.<br>

I agree. I think this is even more important when you consider<br>
how many "adults" have the intellectual capacity of a 10-year old.<br>
If we want civilization to *seriously* extropically evolve, it will require<br>
having a larger number of people (dare I say "mainstream populace?")<br>
gaining a greater understanding of the types of things discussed on this list.<br>
