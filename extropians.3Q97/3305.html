Your comments run parallel to some observations I am making from<br>
_Demon-Haunted World_.  Interestingly, I'm reading it slowly because I am<br>
enjoying his writing so much.  <br>
<p>
When Sagan allegates that those perpetuating pseudo-science believe their<br>
themes to be inventive and creative -- these crop circles and UFO-ridden<br>
stories based in part on the believer's wishes and hinged on his<br>
superstitions.  In contrast, the science he beholds is comprised of far<br>
greater imaginative concepts and far greater mysteries than those invented<br>
by pseudo-science advocates: The sweep of the universe with its complex<br>
arrangement of atoms while a billion years old; and one of millions other<br>
galaxies that are in the same universe as we transhumans who are questioning<br>
life and our future as we recognize our ancestors to be the same ancestors<br>
of apes --  is something quite grand.<br>
