<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I read the other mail also. I think you made several points.<br>
But would you go back with me to this example !<br>
Basically it comes directly from Ralph C Merkle.<br>
My question: will it be me when I wake up ?<br>
I still think that if you freeze the whole process of mutation in your<br>
Brain, and every (smallest) particle has no movement what so ever.<br>
You have died: and there is this absolute last state of mind frozen in<br>
you.<br>
<p>
OLD EXAMPLE:<br>
To give you one example of my opinion: <br>
I freeze a person.<br>
When he is in cryo-suspension.<br>
I put all relevant data in a computer, destroy the<br>
original. Build a new one, and wake him<br>
He will claim, he is the one who went into <br>
The Cryo-suspension.<br>
There is no way this person, will have a memory,<br>
That tells him he has been copied, since I gave<br>
Him the exact brain-pattern where he started with<br>
<p>
So the place is the same !<br>
And the time for the Brain activity is frozen !<br>
If this is not ME anymore ! then you consider a person, as more<br>
than an information entity operating in a dynamic-particle-system.<br>
I ask this because, what would be the difference between cleaning<br>
up the freezing damage and make everything new ?<br>
Again: I'm still talking about a PERFECT copy (new build original?)<br>
<p>
