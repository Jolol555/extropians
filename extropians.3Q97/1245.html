     &lt;snip&gt;...there was a chat show on a couple of days ago. They were <br>
     talking about the problems with child crime on the streets, a couple <br>
     of people were discussing the need to get kids 'off the streets', and <br>
     then a woman in the audience stood up and said:<br>
     <br>
     "We don't need to be out on the streets helping these kids, we need to <br>
     be in our homes praying for their souls"<br>
     <br>
     The audience clapped and cheered.  There's you problem.<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight adds:<br>
     <br>
     I don't even have to say "consider the source."  Whoops, I said it.<br>
     <br>
     Yes it is a problem and one worth clarifying.  Devoting energy <br>
     myopically to traditional methods of focused intention (meditation, <br>
     prayer) and not considering what physical actions to be taken is where <br>
     the problem is.  Simple imbalance.  If this same woman was hungry, <br>
     would she pray to be satiated by her higher power or would she go and <br>
     fix herself something to eat? <br>
     <br>
     Paraphrasing Peter Gabriel (I just heard this this weekend):<br>
     <br>
     "From the people come the dream, from the dream comes the vision, from <br>
     the vision comes the change."<br>
     <br>
     Me thinks the woman's comments, however lauded by the likely-simpleton <br>
     audience were not about genuine concern for the welfare of these kids <br>
     but yet another opportunity to grandstand about her belief system and <br>
     her perceived superiority within it.<br>
     <br>
