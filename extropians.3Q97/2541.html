&lt;&lt; <br>
 After carefully reading EvMick's questionable commentaries on government<br>
 and life in general I have come to the regrettable -- but constructive --<br>
 conclusion that it might be in his best interest to seek competent<br>
 professional assistance to help him relieve himself of his problems.   <br>
 <br>
 Respectfully,<br>

Nice try guy...if you've read any history I guess you know this approach is<br>
often used...If all else fails...(ie. logic...the weight of physical evidence<br>
go against you..etc) then invoke "God's will" or  call your opponent mentally<br>
maladjusted ...and declare victory...<br>
<p>
The soviet union used this method extensively...(I beleive Alex..Solshenetzen<br>
&lt;sp&gt; wrote books about it...{Gulag Archepelago?...never read them...too<br>
depressing}..as did many theocratic realms in the past...you might audit the<br>
salem witch trial scenario for example...<br>
<p>
<p>
More in Sorrow than in Anger...<br>
<p>
<p>
By the way...I'm beginning to wonder about you...I'm beginning to doubt that<br>
you are "real" so to speak...wouldn't be a bit suprised if you were in<br>
reality about 16 years old ..(good vocabulary though...)  Some of your logic<br>
constructions just don't seem to "click"<br>
<p>
Then again...maybe you're just an Agent Provocature...government uses that<br>
technique a lot....(World Trade Bombing...Oklahoma City Bombing...Viper<br>
Militia Debauchal)...<br>
<p>
Oooops....sorry...those nasty old facts again...must be a product of my<br>
crazed and demented mind...<br>
<p>
(but I still can't shake the picture of a very intelligent, introverted, fat<br>
little pimply faced kid sitting by his computer...dictionary to the<br>
side...howling and cackeling in delight at the antics his logic bombs are<br>
causing among his target group....Next post begins..."I assure you that I am<br>
quiet real...")<br>
<p>
<p>
nawww....been reading too much science fiction<br>
<p>
&lt;there is no such thing as too MUCH science fiction {{{{SLAP!!!!}}}}&gt;<br>
<p>
EvMick<br>
KCMo.<br>
<p>
P.s.  How do you like that tactic? Respond to discreditation  with a new,<br>
better, more debilitating form of descreditation...after all were ALL<br>
crazy...by contemporary standards...&lt;nanotech..minduploading...space<br>
travel.."quick mable call the guys with the white coats"...but some of us are<br>
willing to engage in debabte without using "Ad Hominineum " tactics...a very<br>
juvenile trait.....whence my spurious , whimsical acusation...I really think<br>
you're just who you say you are...retired civil servant...makes perfect<br>
sense.<br>
