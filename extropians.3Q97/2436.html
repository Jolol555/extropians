In recent years there as been a convergence of interest, from a number<br>
of fields of study, on the nature of conscious experience. The<br>
neuroscientist who explores the biological basis of consciousness, the<br>
philosopher concerned with how age old questions of human experience are<br>
explained, the psychologist seeking a more comprehensive view of the<br>
nature and dynamics of subjective experience, and the cyberneticist who<br>
dreams of a robot that thinks for itself, all work with closely related<br>
and overlapping subjects, and all stand to benefit from and contribute<br>
to a common pool of knowledge.  Furthermore, these issues are finding<br>
increasing relevance among the humanities --the traditional home of<br>
discussion on the nature of human experience.<br>
<p>
The study of consciousness is ultimately an interdisciplinary endeavor.<br>
In order to accommodate a more diverse yet focussed dialog on a very<br>
complex subject, the journal PSYCHE &lt;<a href="http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/">http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/</a>&gt;<br>
has established two discussion lists.  Psyche-D is intended for dialog<br>
on issues of theory, while Psyche-B focuses on research and empirical<br>
issues.<br>
<p>
PSYCHE-D for discussion of theoretical issues:<br>
<p>
   * How do we define consciousness? In the broader sense, what<br>
     natural phenomena are we trying to understand? What needs to be<br>
     explained, and why?<br>
<p>
   * What theoretical approaches are being offered in the study of<br>
     consciousness, and how do they contribute to our understanding<br>
     with reference to our definition of the problem?<br>
<p>
   * Just how big is this question, and why?<br>
<p>
<p>
PSYCHE-B for discussion of empirical issues:<br>
<p>
   * What directions in research are suggested by theory? What<br>
     questions are ripe for research?<br>
<p>
   * What can we put our hands on? How can the neural (or other)<br>
     correlates of consciousness be operationally defined and tested?<br>
<p>
   * What research has been done, and what does it contribute to our<br>
     understanding with reference to our definition of the problem?<br>
