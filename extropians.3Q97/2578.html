<i>&gt; Do you know why Foresight has chosen these criteria (including the</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanoscale computational device) as the realization of Feynman's vision?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is it that these criteria represent the "final step" so-to-speak?  </i><br>
<p>
I don't know what the motivation was for choosing devices with this<br>
particular level of sophistication and difficulty.  Obviously there<br>
would be a wide range of alternative choices.  I asked/complained a bit<br>
on sci.nanotech about it, but I didn't get much response.  My view was<br>
that the devices were too difficult, that you'd have to have a fully<br>
mature nanotech to produce such devices, and that the prize would be<br>
more useful if it rewarded a stepping stone on the path to nanotech,<br>
rather than adding (infinitesimally) to the reward at the end.<br>
<p>
I suspect that there is an implicit assumption of a particular path<br>
towards nanotech where these devices would in fact represent an inter-<br>
mediate point.  The fact that 32 copies are needed presents a hint.<br>
Specifically, an atomic force microscope enhanced with interchangeable<br>
tips which can catalyze certain bonds might work.  You'd probably only<br>
be able to build one or a few copies of the nano device, so 32 would<br>
perhaps be within reach.<br>
<p>
Even if this is the explanation, I would still complain that the FI ought<br>
not to be endorsing one particular path and designing a prize which only<br>
makes sense if that path is followed.  (Personally I think the biotech<br>
route to a protein assembler makes more sense.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My observation in all this is that given the typically reactionary</i><br>
<i>&gt; nature of law and legal thought (i.e., "lack of vision"), the regulatory</i><br>
<i>&gt; schema as it exists today will not be able to cope with the technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; and its many varied implications (which are, for all practical and</i><br>
<i>&gt; historical purposes, just around the corner). Without assigning a</i><br>
<i>&gt; normative value to the demise of regulation in our society, it is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; topic that I want to explore in some depth.  </i><br>
<p>
I read that law review article you posted, but I felt that they missed<br>
the point.  The authors seemed to think that the difficulty would arise<br>
in trying to fit nanotech into the current regulatory framework.  They<br>
went into a lot of detail about how it would be hard to decide whether<br>
an in situ nanotech cell repair system was a drug or a medical device.<br>
<p>
My feeling is that it is more likely that nanotech will provoke the<br>
same over-reaction as biotech, namely that research on it will be<br>
heavily restricted.  There will be different levels of containment<br>
necessary, only certain kinds of designs will be allowed, working with<br>
biological specimens will be restricted, certain applications will be<br>
"born classified" as is the case with nuclear research, ethical review<br>
committees will have to sign off on any new direction for research, etc.<br>
<p>
All this regulation is likely to hinder the rate of progress in nanotech<br>
development, and may even limit it so much that only the military is in<br>
a position to develop advanced nano.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nanotech will be regulated, I am certain. My hope is that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; regulations will correctly balance the risk-return equation.  </i><br>
<p>
Who can know what the right answers are?  We all know that both the<br>
risks and return are almost incalculably high.  I certainly don't claim<br>
to know what the right path is to steer around the dangers.<br>
