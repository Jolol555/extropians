Well, the first thing that sticks in my mind is our radiowave<br>
emanations. That radio had been in wide use for over 20 years prior to<br>
Roswell, and even TV broadcasts occured 11 years prior, not to mention<br>
the large electrical discharges  in recognisable patterns that people<br>
like Nicola Tesla had been using since before WWI gives one enough of a<br>
change in the radio output of our solar system to be noticable.<br>
Considering that our sun is such a mellow, stable yellow dwarf, such a<br>
rapid change in radio output is obviously a sign of technological<br>
intelligence developing, that should to any scientist, be a chance to<br>
study a whole new society.<br>
<p>
Sure its obvious that any other intelligent society would send out<br>
probes. That isn't a question thats worth debating. Whether we are the<br>
first in our star cluster is the real question. What is the<br>
density/spread of intelligent life in our galaxy? Even the pessimistic<br>
Sagan said that there are between 1 and a dozen such civilizations in<br>
existence at any one time (based on a formula that someone came up<br>
with), and this was when he was expecting our own species to be snuffed<br>
out before the millenium by nuclear holocaust. Given that that<br>
particular threat seems to be over, then the likelihood of even more<br>
such civilizations being in existence rises by a huge magnitude.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First, the Air Force's 'mogul' explanation's biggest problem for me is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; amount of material found (supposedly scattered for over a quarter of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; mile).  I've seen photo's of the 'mogul' balloons and 'there just ain't</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough stuff there to be noticeable' for that area (especially after being</i><br>
<i>&gt; blown around in a thunderstorm).  The largest component by far is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; balloon itself.  Even the ranch hand would know balloon material was not</i><br>
<i>&gt; some 'unknown' metallic structure.  The Air Force personnel certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt; would.</i><br>
<p>
And the fact that they ignore the "fuselage" of the vehicle that the<br>
materials came from at a different site a few days later, according to<br>
witnesses.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Second, the Air Force has yet to explain the extreme security measures it</i><br>
<i>&gt; took to recover and dispose of this 'balloon'.  Even if it was a top secret</i><br>
<i>&gt; spy device a simple gathering of the wreckage of a 'weather balloon' and an</i><br>
<i>&gt; embarrassing apology for releasing a false report ('We have recovered a</i><br>
<i>&gt; flying saucer') would have sufficed.  Besides, if it WAS a top secret</i><br>
<i>&gt; spying device why wasn't the Air Force actively searching for it?</i><br>
<p>
THis is in my mind the biggest hole in their claims. Since the people<br>
who operated the Mogul balloons have said that they never cared about<br>
recovering the balloons since nothing on them was classified, only their<br>
purpose was, then the security measures and priority guarded flight of<br>
the materials to Wright Patterson AFB are completely incongruous. ALso,<br>
the report disclosed that all of the paperwork related to the crash<br>
recovery was destroyed without authorization, and without record of the<br>
date or place where they were destroyed. THis in my mind is a smoking<br>
gun that should justify even deeper poking.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Third,  if the 'cover up' was an attempt to scare the Soviet Union into</i><br>
<i>&gt; believing we DID have a 'flying saucer' and could use the recovered</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology to blow them off the face of the earth then THAT should be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; explanation.  Reagan's SDI project has already been admitted as such for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the most part.  But then, that explanation WOULD be an admittance of 'We</i><br>
<i>&gt; planted the material there' and 'Yes Virginia, the Government DOES lie to</i><br>
<i>&gt; you...'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Fourth.  Now to 'Why?'.  I can currently think of 4 reasons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; a)  Pure curiosity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; b)  Economics.</i><br>
<i>&gt; c)  Security.</i><br>
<i>&gt; d)  Survival.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Both a and b pose no threat to us.  c has the consequences of either 'THEY</i><br>
<i>&gt; would try and sabotage our technology so we could not threaten THEM' or</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'THEY want to help us advance and become allies against some third party</i><br>
<i>&gt; civilization ('This Island Earth', written in the 1950's covered this.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; movie was a joke...read the book.  Jack McDevitt's 'The Engines of God' has</i><br>
<i>&gt; another interesting concept.).  d is double edged too.  THEY could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; looking for suitable new colony locations or just for a 'lifeboat' planet</i><br>
<i>&gt; in an emergency.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I beg to differ about your conclusion with respect to b.<br>
Economic reasons are the greatest threat because it would be very easy<br>
to completely destabilize our economy by suddenly releasing information<br>
to, say, build your own basement fusion or zero point field power<br>
generator. Many people would say to this, "no it just means we are free<br>
of those theiving power company bastards, etc".....but it just shows how<br>
little people understand about economics. Say these aliens released over<br>
the airwaves plans for an easy way for an average joe to build a weapon<br>
of mass destruction. What would happen? Instant bedlam. Nuclear weapons<br>
level terrorism would be the norm for every community. Imagine kids<br>
phoning in a bomb threat to get out of school then....<br>
<p>
Using the Conquistador Syndrome as an example, economics is a good<br>
reason to expose ones existence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The abduction claims are much harder for me to believe.  These 'aliens'</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to go unnoticed so they take 'specimens' and 'torture' them and</i><br>
<i>&gt; release them back into the pack.  Though an alien thought process may</i><br>
<i>&gt; conceive of this as logical, I sure don't.</i><br>
<p>
Such a strategy would be useful if those darn memory erasers weren't so<br>
unreliable.....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One last thing to ponder.  HOW?  I don't think we currently have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology or knowledge to grasp this.  I am of the belief that travel</i><br>
<i>&gt; between solar systems will require a mastery of the Unified Field.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Something along the line of being able to use AND control gravity to fold</i><br>
<i>&gt; time and space.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe its been a while since I posted this, but anyone who understands<br>
relativity knows that a spaceship accelerating at a mere 1 G for one<br>
year reaches 90% of light speed, where time dilation effects start to<br>
happen. Essentially, with a constant thrust vehicle that can accelerate<br>
at 1 G, just about anywhere in the galaxy is reachable in under a<br>
decades flight time, anywhere in our star cluster is reachable in less<br>
than 6 years, and anywhere within 20 light years is reachable in less<br>
than 4 years ship time. So if you have a decent supply of reading<br>
material, a decent hybernation couch, and a good hydroponic system, a<br>
person can go anywhere at sublight speeds. Of course, don't count on<br>
anyone but your grandkids  being alive when you get back from a 20 LY<br>
cruise, unless people start living a lot longer.<br>
