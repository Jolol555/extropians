<p>
In a free, competitive market, auto manufacturers will retool their<br>
plants only if good for their long-term, bottom-line profits. <br>
<p>
However I'm not convinced that corporations care about long-term<br>
viability as much as they used to (at least in the U.S.). <br>
<p>
There are competing interests involved here: shareholders and<br>
corporations. Shareholders are individuals interested in making money as<br>
quickly as possible while corporations are entities interested in their<br>
own<br>
long-term viability.<br>
<p>
Short-term vs. long-term.<br>
<p>
This is a common tension in business as well as politics. How do we plan<br>
for the future without sacrificing the present?<br>
<p>
IMO, the increased volatility of American financial markets in recent<br>
years has destroyed the little balance that once existed between these<br>
two poles. Few investors, in light of the day-to-day jumps and drops of<br>
once-stable securities, are interested in long-term holdings. Indeed<br>
many investors, speculators as the extreme example, concern themselves<br>
with the movements of tiny slivers of the economy, often overreacting to<br>
the sometimes contradictory information that spills across the media.<br>
Thus, while management would normally seek to secure the future of a<br>
corporation by investing its available assets into new projects,<br>
research and development, and state-of-the-art facilities, in practice,<br>
management reacts to this investment pattern by placing undue emphasis<br>
on the short-term bottom-line, i.e., current earnings.<br>
<p>
	This seems to occur because increased current earnings means improved<br>
stock performance. That is, the ability of a business to raise<br>
additional capital, whether by equity or debt, depends largely upon the<br>
market’s current valuation of the company’s shares. Managers are thus<br>
willing to diminish the priority of long-term corporate investment in<br>
exchange for strong, but short-term, stock performance, thereby ensuring<br>
a steady stream of capital for other purposes. Furthermore, the dramatic<br>
increase in hostile takeover attempts that characterized the 1980s has<br>
had an undeniable effect upon most corporate management. The best<br>
anticipatory defense to a hostile takeover is for management to keep the<br>
stock trading at a high price to minimize the lure any control premium<br>
might offer. Thus, managers have only good reasons for concentrating on<br>
the short-term earnings potential of the corporation. High stock values<br>
keep shareholders happy, ensure steady streams of raw capital, and have<br>
the unique ability to thwart takeover attempts.<br>
<p>
The ultimate result of the current short-term fixation is an<br>
ever-aggrandizing problem: <br>
<p>
1) Market volatility causes investors to concentrate on their short-term<br>
gains;<br>
<p>
2) As managers concentrate on spurts of current earnings to keep share<br>
values intact, investment takes second priority. Without research and<br>
development, state-of-the-art factories, robotics, etc., American<br>
companies will be hard-pressed to compete with the burgeoning Pacific<br>
Rim industrial powers. This can only result in a loss of the American<br>
technological initiative and continuing yearly trade deficits; <br>
<p>
3) With the lack of a deliberate investment plan providing the<br>
foundation for growth, the degree of oscillation between good earnings<br>
years and bad earnings years becomes wider and wider. This oscillation<br>
translates to market volatility. A volatile market hurts the little<br>
investor disproportionately as it becomes impossible to keep up with<br>
ever-changing information, much less develop a coherent investment<br>
strategy. This in turn causes more people to place their money into<br>
mutual funds, whose block purchases and sales can only breed more<br>
volatility, and;<br>
<p>
4) Finally, as noted, market volatility breeds an investor who is overly<br>
concerned about short-term wealth. <br>
<p>
5) Here, the cycle begins again.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately for technophiles like myself, this cycle means that U.S.<br>
corporations are likely to sit on innovations which have little<br>
short-term benefit (or in the case of this new hydrogen fuel cell,<br>
innovations that mean possible short-term losses) until the short-term<br>
benefits increase. Short-term benefits increase only when everyone else<br>
has already upgraded to the new technology and it becomes a survival<br>
issue.   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The other possible effects would include a</i><br>
<i>&gt; change in some of the balances in powers due to the possible lessening of</i><br>
<i>&gt; dependence on mid-east oil,</i><br>
<p>
Yet another reason why this technology might be squelched in the U.S.<br>
Vested oil interests in the form of big-money corporations have lots of<br>
money to throw around to legislators and connnected lobbyists. If the<br>
oil trade is ever threatened in the U.S., expect a tooth-and-nail fight<br>
to end all fights. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the controls --if any -- over the production</i><br>
<i>&gt; and distribution of hydrogen as a fuel, the ecological effects and any and</i><br>
<i>&gt; all possible socio-economic changes and other such contingencies.</i><br>
<p>
Government, which is inherently conservative (in the literal, not<br>
political sense), will always try to stem the flow of fast-paced change<br>
to avoid wrenching the status-quo out of shape. When revolutionary<br>
changes begin to happen at the pace many on this list and elsewhere are<br>
expecting, government will have to stem a torrent. I'm not convinced<br>
it's up to the challenge.<br>
