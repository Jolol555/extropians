<p>
All representations are abstract.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;though a representation can "abstractly" model or represent other         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;physical phenomenon         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
All models are abstract.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;if the two are not the same fundamental physical phenomenon that is         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;all they are is abstract representations of each other.  </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
Then you have not seen any of my posts, only "abstract" representations <br>
(a redundant phrase) of them. Perhaps that's why I haven't convinced you, <br>
my "original" post was much better on my computer.                        <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;the sensations representing color text on a cathode ray tube are        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;drastically different than the sensations of hearing a voice   </i><br>
<i>        &gt;synthesizer read it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
What about the difference between reading text on my cathode ray tube and <br>
reading it on yours, would that make it different text and a different post?<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;They are not fundamentally precisely the same.  </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
My post does not need to be precisely the same for it to be my post. My  <br>
uploaded brain would not need to be precisely the same for it to be me, some <br>
aspects of my brain are not important, like its color or taste or the sound <br>
it would make when dropped from a 5 story building.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;An abstract machine's "favorite" color would simply be an arbitrary         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;abstract representation or a setting of a bit, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I see no evidence that the way you determine your favorite color is any <br>
different.<br>
                <br>
<i>        &gt;not having anything to do with the fundamental value of any actual         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;feeling or the actual nature of the way the bit is represented.</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
If the value of a bit was determined by the way it was represented then the <br>
concept of "bit" would be completely useless. The computer revelation started <br>
when people discovered this is not true and information exists independent of <br>
the thing that represents it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;When we try to figure out our favorite color we don't consult the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;setting of some abstract bit like an abstract machine must, we try         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to emotionally feel the various color sensations and see which is of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;most value  to us.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
When we look at a color we feel a lot of pleasure or a little pleasure or <br>
no pleasure at all. I don't know how many levels the human mind needs but  <br>
I'll bet a 32 bit number could cover it.  <br>
     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I would much rather only be able to feel a single red sensation (and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;no other color sensation) than to have all my representations be         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;completely abstract and valueless.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If I have always seen the world in black and red that would be no different <br>
from seeing the world in black and white, and if I only saw the world in red <br>
and red I would be as blind as if I saw it in black and black.  Also, I don't  <br>
see how any sensation can be anything but " completely abstract" and I'm  <br>
totally confused why you equate abstract with valueless. <br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Have you never heard of the blind person that could only remember a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;patch of blue and how they cherished that memory even though they         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;could no longer really experience or remember any other seeing         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;experience?    </i><br>
     <br>
<p>
They could remember blue but not black or white or light or dark or any other <br>
color? No, I've never heard of that.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Some day we may discover other as yet unexperienced quale  [...]  We         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;do not require such additional contrasting qualia to know what red         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;is like.</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
If I discovered a new color then my understanding of red would change too, <br>
into something much richer.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Are you claiming that your subjective experience would be identical         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;since your behavior could be identical whether you wear color         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;inverting glasses or not?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, if I wore the glasses from birth. I can't prove it but I'm convinced  <br>
that's true.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If such an absurd notion is what you are claiming this is where the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;burden of proof should lie I would think.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
All you have done is assume that the subjective experience is different and <br>
then claim you have proven it.  I'm saying we can never prove or disprove <br>
anything about subjectivity unless we accept the axiom that behavior is <br>
linked to experience.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You should try putting on some colored glasses some day and see how         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;different things feel </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
Why, what would that prove? My behavior would be different as well as my <br>
experience, at least for a while. I do remember reading about an experiment  <br>
where people wore glasses that reversed up and down, after a few days they  <br>
said they hardly noticed the glasses and their behavior was not unusual. <br>
When the experiment was over and they took the glasses off things looked odd,<br>
it took several more days to get back to normal. By the way, the image the <br>
human eye produces on  the retina is upside down, our brain just compensates <br>
for it.            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;As I said before, an identical duplicate of a physical phenomenon is         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;more than just "knowledge of" or a "model of" a physical behavior,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;it is the same physical phenomenon.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then I don't have knowledge of anything. I thought I "knew" that the earth <br>
went around the sun and the moon went around the earth but I am not the earth, <br>
I am not the sun and I am not the moon.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;This kind of real, non abstract, knowledge is the best kind of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;knowledge and the only real or non abstract knowledge.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Do you just mean subjective experience? If not can you give me a specific  <br>
example of "non abstract knowledge"?<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Why would you ever lack the faith that we can figure it out? What         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;evidence is there that says it is any more difficult than any other         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;physical phenomenon we now finally understand?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Because the only tool we have to investigate consciousness, or even determine <br>
that any exists other than our own, is behavior, if you reject that you have <br>
nothing left.<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;OK, it's the year 2525 and you have just thought up a bright shiny        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;new theory explaining exactly what subjective experience is all        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;about.  How do I know if it's even approximately correct?</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Just like any other law of physics: it accurately predicts  what is         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;occuring and enables us to control it.  </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
If it accurately predicts behavior that would be good enough for me, but not <br>
you, you want more proof but you will never get it. How will you ever know if <br>
your theory accurately predicts subjective experience when you have no way of <br>
independently knowing what that subjective experience is?<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If we objectively and reliably know that a particular neural         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;corelate (as Crick likes to call it) corresponds  to a salty         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;sensation </i><br>
<p>
<p>
How on Earth could we ever know that? It might correlate to 2 people making  <br>
a noise with their mouth that sounds like "that tastes salty" and I think  <br>
it's reasonable to assume that they also subjectively experience a salty <br>
sensation, but I thought you didn't accept that. You're assuming the very <br>
thing you're trying to prove.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;then we will know if two people use the same sensation to represent         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the taste of salt by whether or not there is the identical neural         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;corelate.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If true then you can be certain it is NOT the same sensation because it can <br>
not possibly be the identical neural correlate, they are different brains, <br>
and in your same post you said " Only identical physical phenomenon can <br>
perfectly model every single quality and attribute of another."  <br>
