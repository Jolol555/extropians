<i> &gt; UN has terminated the shooting in Bosnia, and there is some hope</i><br>

<i> &gt; if the UN is given adequate funding.</i><br>
<p>
UN committed genocide against the Bosnian Muslims by enforcing an<br>
arms embargo against Yugoslavia at a time when most of the organized<br>
Yugoslavian armed forces, and almost all of their materiel, was in<br>
Serbian hands. You credit them with stopping, three years later,<br>
a bloodbath that they (inadvertently?) laid the groundwork for.<br>
Aided and abetted by the United States, of course.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Small potatoes!.</i><br>
<p>
A green plague of ten different high-latency fatal strains of<br>
virus will be quite useful to small potatoes terrorists. I<br>
don't think the size of the potatoes is at issue here.  Small<br>
potatoes can be quite deadly, especially nowadays.<br>

<i> &gt; UN itself would not need to be impartial (though it would presumably</i><br>
<i> &gt; be much less partial that the parts that are fighting), it would</i><br>
<i> &gt; only need to implement the decisions of some independent tribunal.</i><br>
<p>
I still don't understand why you think that "world government"<br>
or transferring more power from the current nations to the UN<br>
would increase the likelihood that large civil disputes would<br>
be settled by the decisions of an independent tribunal. If the<br>
disputants don't accept the decisions of the tribunal (and they<br>
often don't) what is the difference from the current situation?<br>
These sorts of things come down to primates and their will to<br>
fight, their reasons for fighting, and the extreme difficulty<br>
of communication, as both a transmitting and a measuring<br>
process. Implementing an accounting change at the top-level has<br>
many dangers of its own, and furthermore, does little or<br>
nothing to address the dangers that you're worrying about. The<br>
proposals you are making, it seems to me, would simply pile new<br>
dangers on top of the existing dangers.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; The future is frightening, be brave.</i><br>
<p>
Cowardice is not the motivation behind my arguments, I<br>
assure you. I mentioned fears only because your proposals were<br>
set forth in the name of allaying fears of military<br>
destruction.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt; By real power I mean the power they have in the world as opposed</i><br>
<i> &gt; to the power they have within the present UN. I don't have any</i><br>
<i> &gt; specific proposals for how to measure it, but I think a UN is less</i><br>
<i> &gt; likely to function well if some nations perceive that they are</i><br>
<i> &gt; underrepresented. (A rough measure of real power would be GNP.)</i><br>
<p>
Ah, there's the rub. It is less likely to function well if some<br>
nations perceive that they are underrepresented. And I can<br>
guarantee you that some of them will perceive that, no matter<br>
what you do.<br>
<p>
Military troubles are worst in the poorest nations. Allocating<br>
political power by GNP will do almost nothing to soothe these<br>
troubles. Better to keep poor countries and rich countries politically<br>
decoupled from one another. What you are proposing is to arrange<br>
for the rich countries to rule the poor countries (that's what your<br>
"representation according to 'real' power seems to come down to),<br>
which I guarantee will lead to war. It's been tried already.<br>
