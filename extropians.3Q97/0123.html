It says that there is a huge number of things I should study and I only have <br>
a limited amount of time to do it in, it says I'm trying to determine if I <br>
should bother to read Wilson or if my time could be better spent doing other <br>
things. If Wilson really does equate having contempt for Immanuel Velikousky <br>
with the persecution Galileo suffered then I think I have my answer.<br>
 <br>
I live in a world of spoon benders, religion, bigfoot, astrology, crying  <br>
statues of the virgin Mary, faith healers, pictures of Jesus found in <br>
spaghetti billboards, Angels, Velikousky, pictures of Jesus found in oil <br>
stains in the men's room of transmission repair shops, ESP, pyramid power, <br>
and bug eyed monsters who travel millions of light years just so they can <br>
stick an anal probe up the ass of some redneck who lives in the middle of a <br>
swamp.  With all these juicy targets for satire available Wilson goes after <br>
Carl Sagan, one of the very few who has the courage and intelligence to say <br>
the Emperor has no cloths and it's all pure idiocy.<br>
<p>
Perhaps Wilson is a good comedian, I don't know, but his ideas sound about as <br>
deep as Bob Hope's.                            <br>
