<i>&gt;  &gt; Reason overrides free choice. Most people are a bit like dumb kids</i><br>

<i>&gt;  &gt; to keep them from harm is imo morally perfectly acceptable. They</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; will thank you later for it, and if not, they can still kill</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; themselves later...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh, I dunno. If I was in the subordinate position in this</i><br>
<i>&gt; scenario, I would be *much* more interested in killing my</i><br>
<i>&gt; tormentor than in killing myself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
"Subordinate" is hardly the correct word here. I'm talking friends and<br>
relatives,<br>
frozen or otherwise preserved after their natural death without having<br>
given<br>
their consent. If the future turnes out the way I hope it will, these folks<br>
will be<br>
restored to life. Upon realizing that I (or other transhumanists) was right<br>
all<br>
along (no mystical afterlife, you *can* "repair" the dead, technology has<br>
enabled mankind to explore the universe and so on) they will probably<br>
accept the situation. I still assume that no-one *really* wants to die,<br>
that if  *real* "youth pills" or "immortality potions" were handed out on<br>
the street (and it had somehow [hypothetically] been proven that they<br>
work), the same people who "oppose" cryonics etc. would be fighting over<br>
them. <br>
<p>
Therefore, I strongly doubt it that anyone I want to save would hate, let<br>
alone<br>
kill me for it. Terms like "tormentor" may add some spice to your <br>
comment, but in reality the frozen reluctant ones will almost certainly<br>
wake as our equals, with the same benefits like enhanced minds etc.<br>
Definitely _not_ as<br>
"victims" or "slaves" or something like that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You're sounding awfully smug up there on top of your imaginary</i><br>
<i>&gt; throne, Mr. Otter.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Ok, so modesty isn't my greatest virtue...in fact, if my ego (on a good<br>
day) were<br>
to take on shape and substance, and if it would take up position halfway<br>
between the sun and the earth...there would be darkness.<br>
But seriously, don't you think that we're the icing on the human cake :;))<br>
