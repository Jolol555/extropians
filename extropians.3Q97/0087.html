<i>&gt; &gt; In the situation, the person would not be killed for that reason, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they have committed much more heinous reasons for which to be erased,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; but may be spared if they indicated that they had the capacity to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; redeemed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What do you think would be valid indications that one has the capacity</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be redeemed? The one doing the indicating is the criminal himself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Are any of his or her indications ever to be trusted and thereby termed</i><br>
<i>&gt; valid?</i><br>
<p>
There are trustable scientific means of veradication which can be<br>
employed to determine the truth of the prisoner's statements.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I suppose we're talking about repeat offenders who have shown no</i><br>
<i>&gt; capacity for redemption. In such a case, how many tries does a criminal</i><br>
<i>&gt; get? Or using the prior discourse, how many times must a criminal</i><br>
<i>&gt; recidivate before he has demonstrated his or her lack of capacity for</i><br>
<i>&gt; redemption?</i><br>
<p>
I really like the three strikes laws, but putting them away permanently<br>
is not the answer. Three strikes should be the point at which a criminal<br>
is exterminated, at a minimum. A heinous capital crime should of course<br>
be a pick your fate the first time routine...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is to determine whether the material being judged is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; capable of being recycled or should be incinerated that such an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; evaluation is made...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I (stick neck out) would suggest that all material is capable of being</i><br>
<i>&gt; recycled. Especially as scarce and valuable a material as intelligent</i><br>
<i>&gt; life.</i><br>
<p>
Depends upon the degree to which you mean recycle. As fertilizer, sure.<br>
As a living breathing human being? Maybe not without a lobotomy and/or<br>
castration. Your one mistake is assuming intelligence in the first<br>
place....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The criminal must demonstrate their capacity to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; redeemed. If he doesn't, lets not waste further tax dollars on him, fry</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the mad dog.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you think that people are always responsible for their actions? I</i><br>
<i>&gt; tend to waffle on this point (to a fault), so I hope you might let me</i><br>
<i>&gt; pick your brain a bit.</i><br>
<p>
Even an alcoholic is responsible for what happens during their<br>
blackouts, as they made the concious choice to drink, to not seek<br>
treatment. A free society demands that its citizens be responsible for<br>
themselves. If one is not responsible for their actions, or cannot be<br>
responsible for their actions, they either need to be institutionallized<br>
as a retarded individual, or exterminated.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I value human life highly. So highly that I feel that people who do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; value human life do not value their own life enough to go on living.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So then the reason for frying them is not that they do not value other</i><br>
<i>&gt; human lives, but rather that they do not value their own? Or is it a</i><br>
<i>&gt; combination of the two? To take this further along the so-called</i><br>
<i>&gt; tangent, why is human life any different than other life? Unless we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; talking about sentience, life is life is life. I would argue that to</i><br>
<i>&gt; value human life to the exclusion of all other life is not valuing life</i><br>
<i>&gt; at all. It is homophilia, maybe evolutionary, but merely an innate wish</i><br>
<i>&gt; to see the species continue. Do you think that you might be talking</i><br>
<i>&gt; about valuing intelligent life?</i><br>
<p>
Human Life = Sentience. That life may have sentience or not, but<br>
sentience always presupposes life is what separates the two. When I<br>
state "human life" I mean sentience, not life in general. The golden<br>
rule dictates that man treat his fellow man as he wishes to be treated.<br>
If one denies another continued sentience, society must assume that that<br>
one also seeks to be denied sentience.<br>
<p>
This does not conflict with the principle of innocent until proven<br>
guilty, as the accused is not necessarily the true killer, but once the<br>
killer is found by a process of evidentiary review by a jury of peers,<br>
society is morally bound to carry out the golden rule.<br>
