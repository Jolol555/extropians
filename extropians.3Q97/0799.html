<p>
Microsensor tech is moving very rapidly in this direction.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; You can sheild a large part of it, but you are going to preserve the</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; turnaround, you've gotta have two sheilds, unless you can unhitch from</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; it and turn around and rehitch to the sheild at midcourse.</i><br>
<p>
A central advantage of a nanotech spacecraft would be the ability to self-repair<br>
in fight (see "The Starseed/Launcher", <a href="http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb">http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb</a>).<br>
This might also include repairing biologicals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You missed the point; the shield is just supposed to be a big hunk of junk</i><br>
<i>&gt;which flies along in front of your ship and erodes when hit.</i><br>
<p>
Im my proposal, a single shield is replaced with a "convoy" of shields <br>
("point probes") and forward-looking sensors, rather than being 'dumb matter'.<br>
Much less mass required, and the shields can serve other functions as well.<br>
With sensors far enough ahead, it may be feasible to explosively disassemble <br>
the starship to navigate around the larger obstacles, or simply create corridors<br>
through the ship for smaller objects to pass through.<br>
<p>
 But you're<br>
<i>&gt;right; you would have problems holding it in place while braking. </i><br>
<p>
Could use "leapfrog" braking, or force beams to stand off the shields.<br>
Alternatively, equip each separated portion with its own brakes.<br>
<p>
 I guess<br>
<i>&gt;you'd just rely on the exhaust from your engines vaporising anything small</i><br>
<i>&gt;before it hit you; if you hit anything big you're dead anyway, shield or</i><br>
<i>&gt;no shield. </i><br>
<p>
see above.<br>
