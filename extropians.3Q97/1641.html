Reference: Aristoi by Walter Jon Williams<br>
               : Latest book by Louis McMaster BuJold (Mirror Dance?) about<br>
Miles' Clone Brother<br>
               : Society of the Mind by Marvin Minsky<br>
               : a variety of "split brain" studies in patients in which the<br>
corpus collusum was surgically severed.<br>
               : various "multiple personality disorder" cases<br>
<p>
How much of the brain does it take to support the personality? Surely the<br>
Visual Cortex is not required for that function...nor are the areas of the<br>
brain relating to the other senses (smell, taste, hearing, touch etc) nor<br>
that which is required to support the metabolism.  (keep the heart pumping ,<br>
liver, kidney...etc)...ignore all of that and what have we left? What per<br>
centage of the brain relative to it's size?<br>
<p>
Now look at it from a different perspective.  How many personalities occupy<br>
that space?  <br>
<p>
My understanding of the "Society of Mind" and other works is that there are a<br>
bunch.  Operating sequentially and simultaneously.  Split Brain studies<br>
suggest this as well.  In a well integrated "psyche" there appears to be only<br>
one personality....not true....there are many personalities....each coming<br>
"on line" as the situation warrants...and going dormant when not needed. All<br>
thinking it is the only one.<br>
<p>
Walter Jon Williams and Louis McMaster Bujold's works speculate as to what<br>
would happen were this not the case.  Suppose you had multiple personalities,<br>
a well integrated "team" of personalities.  I REALLY wish I did....have a<br>
personallity who didn't find lifting weights to be unutterably boring....so I<br>
could do something interesting while he was exercising the body.<br>
