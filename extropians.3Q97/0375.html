<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) what's its power source?</i><br>
<p>
The idea is that this spec includes an "egg yolk" power source enough<br>
to get it started building.  Then it relies on environmental sources,<br>
essentially solar energy, as it spreads out.  First it's a grain of sand,<br>
then a small blotch on the soil, than a larger, dark green spot, extending<br>
roots below to find the elements needed.  A few cubic inches of super-<br>
computer, built below the soil, are enough to boot up the millions of<br>
alien minds which arrived in the seed.  These researchers guide the<br>
remainder of the expansion, careful study, building equipment and<br>
supplies, a whole interstellar expedition.  When the time is right,<br>
communications equipment is built in space or on the ground.  All the<br>
plans, blueprints, and stored minds arrived in the seed.  That's what<br>
you can do with nanotech.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; hiding is not a priority. you think that any aliens must be some</i><br>
<i>&gt; superbeings because in your heart you think that humanity is too stupid</i><br>
<i>&gt; to ever reach other star systems, so if they can get here, they must be</i><br>
<i>&gt; so much better than we are. BS. They will put their pants on pretty much</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same way as we do, and will be just as messed up as individuals as</i><br>
<i>&gt; we are.</i><br>
<p>
I completely disagree.  Statistically, the chances that the aliens just<br>
happen to be within 100 years of our own technological development is so<br>
low as to be absurd.  100 years is less than one ten thousandth of one<br>
percent of the age of the Earth.  Imagine two planets which happened<br>
to create intelligent life which flowered at exactly the same time,<br>
to this level of precision.  Impossible!<br>
<p>
You don't seem to appreciate the power which we're going to be able<br>
to wield in 100 years.  Ever hear of the "singularity"?  Ever hear of<br>
"nanotech"?  Ever hear of AIs billions of times more intelligent than<br>
the smartest humans today?  In 100 years *we* (meaning our cultural<br>
descendants) should be able to launch the interstellar expedition<br>
described above.<br>
<p>
This is the biggest problem I have with UFO stories.  The aliens are<br>
laughable caricatures, Buck Rogers in a flying saucer.  They're just<br>
like we would have been back in the 1940's if we had that era's idea<br>
of future technology.<br>
<p>
The stories which really make me laugh are the biological ones.  Did you<br>
know the aliens need to swoop down at night and steal the sex organs <br>
from *cows*?  I won't even get into the abduction tails of forced sex and<br>
hybrid human/aliens.  This is ludicrous.  If the aliens want biological<br>
samples, they can use nanotech probes and get them invisibly!  And once<br>
they have a few they certainly don't need to keep coming back for more,<br>
they can make as many as they want, ringing their own changes on the DNA.<br>
<p>
The limited abilities of the aliens are due to the limited imaginations<br>
of the people reporting them, nothing more.  It's just as dated as Star<br>
Trek.<br>
<p>
We've got a lot of new people on the list, and they don't seem to have<br>
fully internalized the new way of thinking about the future.  Read some<br>
of Moravec's stuff.  His new book has excerpts on the web at<br>
&lt;URL: <a href="http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/book97/book97.index.html">http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/book97/book97.index.html</a> &gt;.  Read<br>
the other references which have been discussed here recently.  It is<br>
gradually becoming clear that the future is not going to be what we thought<br>
back in the 1960's.  It's going to be awesome, strange and terrible (in<br>
the older sense of the word).  It's going to be great and godlike.  Any<br>
superlative you like can apply.<br>
<p>
This list can be a good place to start thinking about it, but we need to<br>
have less nonsense and more familiarity with what will be possible.<br>
