<p>
You cannot justify your statement about the nature of the pace of change<br>
simply by saying it a fact of life. Cancer is a fact of life. Death is a<br>
fact of life. Bigotry is a fact of life. They are all problems and I<br>
believe they all need to be solved. I'm not necessarily disagreeing with<br>
you, just asking you for a cogent argument.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I say speed them up so I can augment my inefficent physical form with</i><br>
<i>&gt;something more capable.</i><br>
<p>
It seems a little naive to assume that increases in the pace of change, or<br>
even continued change should allow you to do anything at all about your<br>
form. Will you be able to afford it? Will you have access to the<br>
technology? Will you even hear of the developments?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The future is not a hundred, fifty or even ten years down the road.</i><br>
<p>
Er, pedantic perhaps, but yes it is.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Well, to get there, we will have to watch as the world we know it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;entirely turned on its head.</i><br>
<p>
No, for _us_ to get there, we will have to be part of the process of<br>
change. Sit around watching and I suspect you'll be just so much worm<br>
fodder within one hundred years.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You are insignificant. So am I.</i><br>
<p>
This is not a very Extropian attitude. We may not be owed anything by<br>
anyone but that does not have the corollary of insignificance. And if we<br>
truly desire change, insignificant is one thing we cannot _afford_ to be,<br>
either as individuals or as a group.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Waste your energy</i><br>
<i>&gt;trying to fight the facts and you will indeed be dead in five years.</i><br>
<p>
Fact: we're all going to die within an hundred or so years unless we do<br>
something about it. Hmmm... personally, I think some facts are there to be<br>
fought.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The tools for my survival are on their way.</i><br>
<p>
To people with money, and friends in high places, and influence, of whom<br>
you and I have probably never heard. Unless we do something to involve<br>
ourselves.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We are, for all practical purposes, equal.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, but that is completely without any basis. Do I really need to go in<br>
to the relative chances of an American and an Ethiopian getting gene<br>
therapy, or even decent dental treatment?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;No one has any better chance than any other. All your</i><br>
<i>&gt;money, all your resources may be rendered worthless at the Singularity.</i><br>
<p>
Hmmm. 'And He shall judge them one and all at the great Singularity, when<br>
all shall be equal.' Om.<br>
