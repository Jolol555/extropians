<i>&gt; I sure hope Eliezer doesn't cook up something in his basement</i><br>
<i>&gt; lab that will destroy the economy of the northern Andes, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; he's going to have a lot on his conscience, and it probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; won't be very pleasant for him when he realizes just what he's</i><br>
<i>&gt; unleashed.</i><br>
<p>
There's a lot more to it than the economics, though I agree that<br>
alone is an argument against it.  I cannot, off the top of my head,<br>
name an abusable chemical substance that doesn't have some other<br>
valuable use: Cocaine is indispensible in eye surgery, opiates are<br>
the most effective treatment for intractable pain, alcohol is a<br>
good antiseptic and fuel, hemp is a strong fiber, amphetamines can<br>
treat many psychological disorders, even Nicotine has shown some<br>
promise of medical use.<br>
<p>
Destroy the plants, and you destroy not only their evil uses, but<br>
their good ones, and the good uses of any other plant that might<br>
evolve from or be bred from it. <br>
<p>
That some uses of a resource destroy people's live is undeniable<br>
and unfortunate, but the resource itself is the wrong place to put<br>
the blame. <br>
