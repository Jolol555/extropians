A good point. On the other hand, a global civilization may be more<br>
resilent than a local civilization. Previously, most civilizations<br>
have been monolithic administrative systems; empires, states or<br>
closely allied states. But today we are seeing a civilization more<br>
defined by a global economic, scientific and political framework. Of<br>
course, if the world economy would break down then we would be in big<br>
trouble (this was the disaster scenario we came up with in our<br>
scenario planning meeting).<br>
<p>
Another thing that comes to mind is that a large civilizations may be<br>
more stable because they contain more people, see the discussion<br>
about Tasmania in<br>
<a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/diamond/diamond_p5.html">http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/diamond/diamond_p5.html</a> (Why Did<br>
Human History Unfold Differently On Different Continents For The Last<br>
13,000 Years?  by Jared Diamond) which I found very intriguing. <br>
<p>
As a final thought, I would guess that the global civilization we are<br>
speaking of will not really be western. It will be based on western<br>
civilization, but in time I expect it to take on a character on its<br>
own as (say) China and India emerge as fully industrialized and<br>
net.connected nations. <br>
