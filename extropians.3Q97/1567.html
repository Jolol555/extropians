Okay, I asked you this once before, but either you didn't get my<br>
post or you decided that you didn't want to reply to it yet.<br>
<p>
What exactly are you trying to accomplish with this line of argument?<br>
What changes would you like to bring about by presenting this<br>
information?<br>
<p>
These questions are not rhetorical. I mean them quite seriously<br>
and I am very interested in reading your response. (I'd be even<br>
more interested if you were to reply to the long post I wrote,<br>
but if you don't want to do that, I'd at least like to see your<br>
reply to my previous paragraph.) I'll repost my earlier post if<br>
you didn't receive a copy.<br>
