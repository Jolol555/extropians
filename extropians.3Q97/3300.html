This sounds like a good theory and an excellent experiment. <br>
<p>
I'm a Type Six on the Enneagram (IMO), and I know that Sixes<br>
are the temperament type most inclined toward paranoia.  If<br>
"intuition" is defined as "pattern-detecting faculty," then<br>
we Sixes are most sensitive to danger.  Unfortunately, sometimes<br>
we are so sensitive that we see it even when it isn't there. :-/<br>
<p>
As Helen Palmer put it, "Sixes are vigilant.  Their attention<br>
is highly focused, and when they're alarmed, they look outside<br>
for clues to explain their inner uncertainty.  The environment<br>
becomes suddenly meaningful.  Faces and gestures seem to emanate<br>
a response to the unarticulated questions `Do you like me?  Am I<br>
safe?' . . .  All nine types project to some extent, in that<br>
aspects of themselves that are hidden by defenses are attributed<br>
to other people; but projection is almost synonymous with the<br>
fearful tendency.  Danger seems so clearly `out there' until you<br>
start getting feedback . . . "<br>
