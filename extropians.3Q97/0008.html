<i>&gt;Is there a way for PEOPLE to get around other PEOPLE &lt;using&gt; filters to</i><br>
<i>&gt;censor them without their consent? For example, is there a way for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;clever enough Chineese citizen to gain access to those parts of the Net</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Chinnees Government has blocked? Can a high-level filtering system be</i><br>
<i>&gt;hacked? And if so, how? </i><br>
<p>
Yep; web-forwarding (e.g. www.anonymizer.com), email-to-web gateways (you<br>
send a message requesting a certain URL and it mails it back to you),<br>
steganography (hiding 'dangerous' information inside inoccuous images, web<br>
pages or sound files). The first two can be blocked by the government, but<br>
it can simply change URL and/or email address and set up at an uncensored<br>
site.  They could content-filter, but that would massively increase the<br>
load on their routers and it still wouldn't catch the steganography. <br>
