I find myself inclined to agree with your recharacterization of<br>
the usage of the term "compassion" (it agrees with the usage that<br>
I take as most common).  On the other hand, I cannot help but<br>
disagree with your assertion that a *desire* to end suffering is a<br>
prerequisite of acting to end it.<br>
<p>
I see too many counter-examples where actions taken from the<br>
desire to end suffering tend to increase what I see as suffering,<br>
and where actions apparently based on an indifference to suffering<br>
have, as a part-consequence, a reduction in suffering.<br>
<p>
This may seem overly 'picky', but it does seem to me that we can<br>
find a fundamental difference between "what I intend is what<br>
happens" and "from what happens, I can learn what to expect."<br>
<p>
The first seems closely related to assumption (and probably what<br>
many of us call 'idealism' -- albeit not Platonic idealism), and<br>
the second to science.  From what I can tell, science has the<br>
better track record.<br>
