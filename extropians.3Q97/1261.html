        *That* is the most progressive attitude any "minority figure" can<br>
have.  If someone attacks you for being gay, you have every right to defend<br>
your individual sexual orientation.  The problem is that so often, a person<br>
is attacked for his views on a totally different issue and he will fight<br>
that person using the fact that he is gay as ammunition...trying to gain<br>
pity because he is a "minority".  The exploitation of this fact damages the<br>
credibility of the rights group in society's eyes --it would be he who<br>
brought the sexual orientation into question. <br>

<p>
        Indeed.  If an unobtrusive homosexual is hired to do a job well,<br>
the only reason that person should be fired is because he or she does *not*<br>
do the job well.  The issue of that person's homosexuality should not come<br>
into play unless, for some reason, it hinders his\her job.  If a person is<br>
fired *because* he\she is gay but did the job well, then the employer is<br>
discriminating...and that is most certainly unfair.  It is an interesting<br>
idea to have a clause in the contract exclaiming that the employer is<br>
homophobic.  In such a case, if a gay worker still accepts the job, he\she<br>
should acknowledge the risk of his\her sexual orientation in such a position.<br>
That person should know to keep his\her orientation quiet.  The whole idea<br>
of there being discriminatory employers is revolting in the first place; to<br>
be persecuted for something that (as far as I know) cannot be helped is the<br>
most despicable form of domination...it makes a mockery of liberty.  As<br>
long as people like this are in positions of "power", minorities are at a<br>
bit of an impasse.  The question is this: what is the best way to fight<br>
this kind of domination?  If such people won't see reason, what can be<br>
done?  The questions are feasible and are yet to be resolved.<br>
