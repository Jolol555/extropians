<i>&gt; Hello All,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Referring to Arjans "&gt;H is spreading….." , last weekend</i><br>
<i>&gt; When we were forming  EXCEDO (the Dutch &gt;H group )</i><br>
<i>&gt; Dalibor and I had a very lengthy discussion regarding copy and</i><br>
<i>&gt; original.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dalibor: if I quote you wrong please correct!</i><br>
I'll sure do!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anyway the case was:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you make an exact (very important word) copy of an</i><br>
<i>&gt; original person, will it be the same, or will the original</i><br>
<i>&gt; know it is the original and the copy know it is the copy!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I claim that this is related to time!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So: if you copy a person " PERFECT" when everything (atoms) </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is put on a hold. I mean a complete "standstill" The copy</i><br>
<i>&gt; Will not know that he/she is the copy. They can however</i><br>
<i>&gt; go different directions. (Like twins). And when they meet</i><br>
<i>&gt; They start discussing who is who!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dalibor claimed the original will always know he is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; original. I claimed that he then, still is thinking of</i><br>
<i>&gt; one original "spirit"</i><br>
No, I claimed that even the most perfect copy of yourself (your brain)<br>
is just that, a *copy*. It isn't *you* anymore, because your thought<br>
processes have ended with the destruction of your original brain<br>
(assuming the "destructive method" is used when you're uploaded).<br>
If you could upload without damaging the original brain, the situation<br>
would be much clearer. There would be 2 (or more) individuals,<br>
undistinguishable to "outsiders". The fact that they are *exact* duplicates<br>
doesn't mean one has become "redundant" or something. Just like<br>
twins (very poor duplicates) *both* are "unique" individuals, and if one<br>
of them dies *his* life is over, end of imput/output. It is *irrelevant*<br>
for<br>
the dead person how many "perfect" duplicates of him are out there.<br>
They are all separate individuals, eventhough they have exactly the same<br>
neural nets etc.<br>
<p>
If you asked a duplicate if it's ok to shoot him, 'cause there are 10 more<br>
of him anyway, what would he say? "Yeah sure, shoot me"? More likely<br>
it would be something like "no!! take one of *the others*!" <br>
<p>
Now, if you copy a brain, and vaporize it while making a "virtual" replica,<br>
you are in fact killing one individual and creating another. There is *in<br>
essence* no difference with the "shoot one of the copies" example.<br>
If all the copies had a constant link things would probably be different,<br>
because they would *feel* as one, and the loss of one of them would<br>
feel to the rest like the loss of a small (insignificant?) portion of the<br>
brain<br>
would feel to us. Connectedness and constant interactivity are crucial<br>
to the sense of a "self". If you turned the experiment around, and split a<br>
brain in two [hemispheres] you would also create 2 distinct individuals<br>
who would both think and "feel" they are the only "real" one. Death would<br>
feel to, say, the left lobe like death would feel to any "whole" person:<br>
maybe first some fear and pain, then NOTHING...roll the credits!<br>
The other half could live happily ever after, but that wouldn't help the<br>
dead<br>
half very much, IMO. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To give you one example of my opinion: </i><br>
<i>&gt; I freeze a person.</i><br>
<i>&gt; When he is in cryo-suspension.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I put all relevant data in a computer, destroy the</i><br>
<i>&gt; original. Build a new one, and wake him</i><br>
<i>&gt; He will claim, he is the one who went into </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Cryo-suspension.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There is no way this person, will have a memory,</i><br>
<i>&gt; That tells him he has been copied, since I gave</i><br>
<i>&gt; Him the exact brain-pattern where he started with.</i><br>
I fully agree with this. No doubt the copy will think and firmly *believe*<br>
that he's the original, and that he never died. However, IMO he stays<br>
a copy, and there is no continuity of your present "self". To yourself<br>
you've died (of course you'll never know this).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; If you copy one alive though (living in time)</i><br>
<i>&gt; He'll know when he's been copied, therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; It will become a part of his memory, and that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why he can tell he is the copy or the original.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anyone an opinion.</i><br>
Apparently we agree after all on your original question (does a copy<br>
know he's been copied---&gt; probably not). Now there's this tricky ID<br>
thing: is a non-connected copy of any use to "the original"...???<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; Greetings,</i><br>
DdO<br>
