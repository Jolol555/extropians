In a message dated 97-09-10 12:21:43 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; What one person calls a free-market economy, others will call facism. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Then the others haven't studied even the barest smidgin of economics.<br>
<p>
By DEFINITION fascism is private ownership of production...State Control of<br>
same.<br>
<p>
The US is a fascist economy....only no one wants (mostly no one...certain<br>
libertarians are getting huffy) to admit it.<br>
==========================================================<br>
Of course in a true 'Darwinian Economy' optimising use of resources would<br>
mean elimination all non-productive individuals (like ants). After that all<br>
individuals that aren't productive enough given their consumption of<br>
limited recources). So after we kill all physically- or metally chalanged,<br>
unemployed and elderly we give IQ-test to all 5-year olds, score below 110?<br>
Kill them to. Then up the minimum by .5 point per year. Combined with<br>
automation of simpler work we should see some dramatic increase in the<br>
standard of living of smart, hardworking people.<br>
Very optimal, very efficient.<br>
I'll pass...<br>
<p>
=========================================================<br>
<p>
What in the world are you talking about?  I don't claim to be any expert on<br>
anything...but I have read a lot.  My primary basis for evolution theory and<br>
Darwinism are the writings of Richard Dawkins.<br>
<p>
My basis for understanding Economics is the Chicago School...&lt;sorry...drawing<br>
a blank...yeah there it is...&gt; Freidman...et. al.<br>
<p>
I confess this is the first I've heard the term "Darwinain Economy"... <br>
<p>
I think you're sitting up a straw man...naming it "Free Market<br>
Economy"...ascribing all kinds of terrible things to it...and saying it won't<br>
work.<br>
<p>
Needless to say...I don't agree.<br>
