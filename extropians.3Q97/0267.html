Nobody has a gun to your head, if you don't like the new  "bloated" version <br>
then don't buy it and stick with the old one. If many really felt that way <br>
Microsoft would be out of business. They're not.<br>

It's interesting that every one of the people who ran crying to the government <br>
and later testified that Standard Oil's predatory tactics made competition <br>
impossible, nevertheless somehow managed to amass huge fortunes competing <br>
with Standard Oil. Take David P Reighard for example, when Standard Oil <br>
threatened to lower the price so much that he would lose money on every <br>
gallon he sold, Reighard called their bluff, he knew Standard oil sold a lot <br>
more gallons of oil than he did, and so would lose a lot more money than he <br>
would if they tried to do that. Standard Oil realized that the only way to <br>
stop Reighard was to buy him out, which they did, at a huge profit to <br>
Reighard. What did he do with all that money? He built an even larger oil <br>
refinery of course. Standard felt they had to buy that one too, at an even<br>
larger profit to Reighard. Are you starting to  see a pattern here? <br>
In all Reighard did this 3 times before Standard caught on  and gave up, <br>
making him one of the riches men in the country.<br>
                          <br>

<p>
Being small is absolutely no excuse for not being competitive. I manufacture <br>
99% of the worlds widgets, you make 1% .  I want to drive you out of business, <br>
so I figure I'll lower my price until you go broke and then I can jack them <br>
up to anything I want. So now you louse money on each widget you sell, <br>
the trouble is I do too. I have 99 times as much money as you do, but I'm <br>
lousing it 99 times faster. Even worse, because the price is very low the <br>
demand for widgets is huge, and if prices  are to remain low I must build <br>
more factories and increase production. I'm lousing money faster and faster, <br>
meanwhile you just temporally halt production in your small factory and wait<br>
for me to go broke. It won't be a long wait.                    <br>
            <br>
