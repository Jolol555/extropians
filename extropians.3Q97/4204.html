<p>
Polakov, sometime before 1921 (I don't have the details available<br>
at the moment) introduced a classification system for organisms<br>
that differs from our classifications of "plant" and "animal."<br>
That revised classification system depended upon the highest-level<br>
activity of the organism.  What we generally call "plants"<br>
(although not limited to what we call plants) have, as that<br>
activity, what can get called "chemical binding."  Energy input<br>
(sunlight) plus various inorganic chemicals result in interactions<br>
that bind those chemicals into organic chemicals.<br>
<p>
What we call "animals" perform an analogous function by spatially<br>
connecting wide regions, thus "space-binding."  Finally, man, by<br>
depending on communication for building knowledge, and<br>
specifically through the not-always realized possibility of each<br>
generation building on the knowledge of the previous generation,<br>
gets called a "time-binding" organism.  A classification scheme<br>
represents the way we look at a situation;  in this particular<br>
instance, I think that classification according to highest-order<br>
functions may yield insight.<br>
<p>
Applying those classifications in combination with evolutionary<br>
propositions suggests that plants compete on their abilities at<br>
chemical-binding plus the defensive mechanisms against<br>
time-binding organisms -- the stimulated release of toxic phenols<br>
in a cluster of conifers in response to one conifer getting<br>
attacked by a predatory insect, for example.  Plants with a<br>
cooperative phenol-generation 'mutation' survive, and have<br>
offspring, where more vulnerable plants competing otherwise for<br>
similar resources, do not.  For space-binding organisms, we might<br>
expect mobility to represent a major competitive advantage -- the<br>
cheetah and the antelope both have the ability to run.<br>
<p>
For time-binding organisms, we might expect effectiveness *at*<br>
time-binding to play a major role.  The construct of 'meme' may<br>
have something to do with it, but the post-birth development of<br>
the cerebral cortex may have as much to do with it.  For<br>
chemical-binding and space-binding organisms, genetic inheritance<br>
probably suffices to define the gross characteristics of the<br>
evolved organism;  for time-binding organisms, extra-genetic<br>
factors might dominate.  This may make more sense if we consider<br>
genetic-inheritance as representing one specific form of<br>
asymmetric communication from an older generation to a younger;<br>
when considered as a communication function, we might find it<br>
easier to accept other communication functions as a part of the<br>
process.<br>
<p>
If we declare "evolution" as representing, exclusively, the<br>
process that leads to organisms with genetically-inherited traits,<br>
then extra-genetic factors would not play a part in the<br>
classification called "evolution."  If we accept the time-binding<br>
classification as characterizing a *different* mechanism from<br>
genetics (with genetic modification dependent upon mutation plus<br>
selection), but still a part of evolution, then quasi-Lamarkian<br>
descriptions would seem to fit this different mechanism without<br>
invalidating genetic inheritance at structurally lower levels.<br>
The phenomena you describe would fit very nicely into an<br>
extra-genetic quasi-Lamarkian structure for the class of organisms<br>
called "time-binders."  Note that, as a structure different from<br>
the genetic structures normally considered for evolution, we would<br>
have to exercise caution in *not* extrapolating<br>
genetic-stabilities as applying to non-genetic relationships.<br>
<p>
If, eventually, we learn to develop extra-genetic "Cyborg"-like<br>
modifications, an expanded explanation of evolution to account for<br>
more than genetics would seem inevitable.  But, even at the<br>
moment, if we considered ourselves as *already* a part of an<br>
extra-genetic evolutionary structure, then we might take a<br>
somewhat different approach to education, and consider that<br>
education as a tool for cortical development.  <br>
