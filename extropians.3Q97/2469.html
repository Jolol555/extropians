I dcan't speak for Eliezar, but my reason to limit speculation on the<br>
post-Singularity era is that it's essentially unbounded. The SI will be<br>
able to do anything that's not prohibited by the laws of physics, and it<br>
will know the laws of physics. With no constraints, we would really be<br>
speculating on the motivations of the SI. I can (and do) specualate<br>
about this quite a bit, but an attempt to have a rational discourse on<br>
this subject is essentially equivalent to theology, not science, Do it<br>
for entertainment, but don't expect to discover the "right" answer.<br>
I would be very interested in discussions on the era leading up to the<br>
Singularity. In particular, what can we do to minimize societal upheaval<br>
while accelerating the pace of technological advance?<br>
