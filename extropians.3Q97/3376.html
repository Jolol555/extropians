<i>&gt; People are stockholders in corporations. As corporations do well, so</i><br>

<i>&gt; it, would you? I think a social conscience is just that, a social</i><br>
<i>&gt; conscience. It has zero praxis. Its easy to feel bad about "plights." What is</i><br>
<i>&gt; your guilt accomplishing?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Me:  Its accomplishing quite a bit! I think my guilt, to what degree I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have any, is having the encourage to see these problems which many on</i><br>
<i>&gt; this list are too afraid to acknowledge even exists (I hear Marie</i><br>
<i>&gt; Antoinette again).</i><br>
<p>
Exactly my point. Your guilt is accomplishing quite a bit for yourself,<br>
but little for anyone else.<br>
<p>
But you neglect the point I was initially making which is that<br>
corporations have stockholders. To make money you have to start<br>
somewhere. Do you agree that anyone with a little money can buy a few<br>
shares of stock?  <br>
<p>
Then you wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hagbard: Again, the fact that you *DO* care about the majority of</i><br>
<i>&gt; humanity is useless.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Me:  You should be ashamed to call yourself Hagbard (after the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Illuminatus! Character I presume).  The real Hagbard cared very deeply about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the state of humanity.  Tell me, how is caring about ones fellow human</i><br>
<i>&gt; beings useless? </i><br>
<p>
For the record, Hagbard Celine (from RAW, as you so astutely fingered)<br>
is, inter alia, a pragmatic-idealist. When I say useless, I mean<br>
non-utilitarian. Your initial post was an exercise in sanctimony --<br>
idealism for the sake of idealism. It made several proclamations,<br>
without ever saying anything with utility in relation to your view on<br>
the "plight" of humanity. This is what I am taking issue with --<br>
idealism without praxis is useless. Do you disagree? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My compassion has led me to several projects that have</i><br>
<i>&gt; directly benefited people - including my stint with Habitat for Humanity</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the Peace Corps.</i><br>
<p>
Well, now we're getting somewhere. Here, you have found praxis. You've<br>
allayed a measure of your guilt for the time being with altruism. I<br>
don't have a problem with this, and in fact, give you credit for<br>
admitting that your guilt was the reason. So then, given that I value<br>
extropy and do care about humanity, what should I do?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hagbard: Free-market not needed by the people? What is your</i><br>
<i>&gt; alternative? I mean there's pure communalism, pure capitalism and all the fuzzy</i><br>
<i>&gt; gradations in between. Take your pick.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Me:  If there is no third alternative then we are in big trouble!</i><br>
<p>
Okay, I'm operating here from what I know. If you know of another<br>
alternative (Eliezer has been considering this as well) please let me in<br>
on it. If you know of no other alternative, and have no ideas<br>
germinating, then you are wasting bandwidth with mere proclamations.<br>
Maybe you'd like to outline your view of the ideal economic system, or<br>
at least the values that such a system would uphold?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hagbard:  Holly, you must have missed my earlier post (actually, this</i><br>
<i>&gt; morning), on Godwin's Law of Nazi Apologies. What little credibility you</i><br>
<i>&gt; might've had just went out the window in my eyes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Me: I just signed up on this list today, so I missed your post.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; you base a persons credibility on one post then you are very shallow</i><br>
<i>&gt; person indeed.</i><br>
<p>
Here's a summary of my earlier post:<br>
<p>
In a Wired magazine article, Mike Godwin from the Electronic Frontier<br>
Foundation described his efforts in memetics, watching ideologies<br>
replicate from Internet-based communities into society-at-large.  He<br>
formulated "Godwin's Law of Nazi Apologies" which states "As an online<br>
discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis<br>
or Hitler approaches one." He cites also Cliff Stoll, author of "The<br>
Cuckoo's Egg" as "..the law that states that once a discussion reaches a<br>
comparison to Nazis or Hitler, it's usefulness is<br>
over."<br>
<p>
I was referring to your bipolar characterization of extropian thought --<br>
either saintly or Nazi. By Godwin's law, a discussion reaches a<br>
non-utilitarian point when the Nazi comparison is made. You didn't<br>
explicitly call extropians Nazis, but you did insinuate that it was<br>
possible. And this at the very end of ONLY ONE POST! You lost<br>
credibility by suggesting, after one day on the list, that I might be<br>
capable of genocide. That is no substitute for cogent argument, agreed? <br>
<p>
Boat drinks,<br>
