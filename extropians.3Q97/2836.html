CSICOP goes out, collects extensive information, considers alternative<br>
hypotheses, and frequently conducts research to verify them (e.g. Randi's<br>
experiments).  That's the very heart of science.  They've just got a good<br>
nose for what is bunk, and so they mostly investigate nonsense.<br>
<p>
This claim of "fundamentalist materialist dogma" is a smokescreen thown up by<br>
people whose pet ideas don't stand up to scrutiny.  The components of CSICOP,<br>
as scientists, frequently get their pet ideas ruthlessly ground to bit<br>
against the hard truth - that's the nature of science.  Those who aren't<br>
scientists are enough involved in science to suffer this.  Certainly I've had<br>
many of my own beliefs ground up this way over the years.  It's hard<br>
sometimes, but that way lies truth and knowledge.<br>
<p>
The Dogma of "fundamentalist materialism", insofar as it has one, is that<br>
humans are literally incomprehensibly inventive, clever, resourceful, and<br>
deceptive (both of themselves and others).  I do mean literally<br>
incomprehensible - there's nobody who can understand anything like the full<br>
range of capacities of modern humanity.  Anything that can get a human on the<br>
moon, build microchips, eliminate smallpox, and alter the atmosphere can<br>
certainly fake a couple lousy crop circles.  <br>
