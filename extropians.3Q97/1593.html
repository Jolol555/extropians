Personal theory?  Mountainous geography, lots of coastline, and localized<br>
political structures made conquest difficult but communication and trade<br>
easy.  Result: good memes for cooperation and constructive competition got<br>
the upper hand over conquest and religious ones.<br>
<p>
I don't consider modern pluralism descended from the Greeks.  Modern<br>
pluralism developed in England and Holland around 1600 to 1700 as a result of<br>
a loosely similar situation where trade was easy but conquest hard.  They<br>
took lots of (modified) ideas from the Italian Renaissance, which in turn had<br>
gotten lots of (modified) ideas from the surviving Greek texts.  But,<br>
basically, they did it themselves.<br>
<p>
Personal theory, of course.  YMMV<br>
