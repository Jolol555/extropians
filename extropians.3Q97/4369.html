If you are arguing against the inevitability of a singularity, I do agree with what<br>
I think is the implicit assumption you're making above. That is (corrections,<br>
please), we cannot be sure that an augmented human intelligence will think up a way<br>
to further augment the intelligence of an augmented human, etc., ad infinitum. . .<br>
<p>
However, I don't see how sigmoid curves have anything to do with it. S-curves (as I<br>
understand) represent a mere step in the evolution of technology. A technological<br>
advance is made, produced and then obsoleted due to the law of diminishing returns<br>
(obsolescence due to physical limitations, or some kind of outside force, etc). How<br>
much effort need be put into nanotech when we have an assembler? The law of<br>
diminishing returns goes out the window. Nanotech notwithstanding, what is to keep<br>
an augmented intelligence from making a further technological advance, which would<br>
then be subject to an entirely new sigmoid curve? This is bootstrapping at its<br>
finest.<br>
<p>
The short response being that I'm missing your point.<br>
