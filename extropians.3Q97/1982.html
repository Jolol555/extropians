True. I guess I can generalize this a bit. the really neat thing about<br>
interacting with kids is that they are somewhat simpler than adults.<br>
You can learn a lot about people in general by working with the<br>
simpler model. The big problem for me is that they aren't necessarily<br>
simpler in the ways you think they are or "should" be.<br>
<p>
Another thing I've learned is that teaching is a very good way to<br>
learn. I suspect that those of you in academia already know this,<br>
but it's true even when teaching little kids: my mental math skills<br>
are a great deal better than they were before my first kid was four.<br>
<p>
I suspect that this will remain true even when our "children" are<br>
new computer algorithms.<br>
