<i>&gt; Much of which (according to articles I've read by pilots) is imposed by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the government and not really neccesary for safe operation. Even then,</i><br>
<i>&gt; from reading some of Richard Bach's books, the amount of maintenance</i><br>
<i>&gt; required to keep his biplane operational was far higher than that required</i><br>
<i>&gt; for his jets, *and* it crashed more often.</i><br>
<p>
I've never worked on a biplane, but I do know that business jets take a<br>
good multiple of the maintenance time of small props planes. Rebuilding<br>
a turbine engine is a lot tougher than a piston engine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Sorry, the hard radiation of impacts and dopplershift would embrittle</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the materials to a large extent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Isn't that what you have a shield there for? I mean, do you really believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; that any alien race is going to travel from system to system in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; spacecraft that will be considerably damaged by the mere act of travel?</i><br>
<p>
You can sheild a large part of it, but you are going to preserve the<br>
areas of greatest sheilding for your crew, and with a mid course<br>
turnaround, you've gotta have two sheilds, unless you can unhitch from<br>
it and turn around and rehitch to the sheild at midcourse.<br>
<p>
You've also got to deal with the fact that your landing vehicles will be<br>
stored out of their operating environment for several years. Unless you<br>
set up a phased inspection dock in orbit to rebuild the lander before<br>
entering atmosphere, you could have serous problems. For starters, all<br>
gaskets, seals, tires and lamps will probably need replacement. All<br>
systems will need full checkout, inspection, as well as xray inspection<br>
for structural integrity. THis sounds difficult, but its not really,<br>
with the one exception that you get no test flights....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; How do you stop? SOrry, you've got to turn that mutha around and brake</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for as long as you've been accelerating. That puts your ass end open to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reentry through an alien solar systems Oort cloud.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Uh, yes. Just like reentry with the shuttle, only worse. This is why I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think your figure of 0.98c is much higher than they're really use (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; way off the scale for the kind of early mission they talked about).</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't go on a manned mission if it didn't utilize a goodly amount<br>
of relativistic time dilation to shorten trip time for the crew.<br>
Logistics are always the biggest ticket item on such a project, and the<br>
longer your stretch it out the more you spend in magnitudes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; For starters, the shuttle orbits at a mere 17,000 mph, and it still</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; breaks down half the time, causing the mission to be cut in half.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Firstly, note I said 'qualitatively', not 'quantitatively'. We all know</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the shuttle is a massive boondoggle full of cut-price engineering and</i><br>
<i>&gt; frankly I'm surprised it works at all. Even then it's only been called</i><br>
<i>&gt; back early two or three times (not the 50% you mentioned) and the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; time was an early test flight when things were expected to go wrong.</i><br>
<p>
Well, it has some failure on it almost every mission. If the missions<br>
weren't so short to begin with, such failures would be a serious<br>
problem, witness the Mir.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; can't do that on an interstellar mission. "Oops, Snorf, we busted the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; toilet, we've gotta turn around...."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When have NASA ever brought the shuttle back because of a broken toilet?</i><br>
<i>&gt; AFAIR all those aborts were due to broken fuel cells, and the mission</i><br>
<i>&gt; could have happily continued without them were it not for NASA's paranoia.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Once they brought it back due to a broken toilet. ANother time, they<br>
overlooked the question  of how the monkeys they had brought up were<br>
going to defacate cleanly. They wound up with monkey shit all over the<br>
shuttle decks.<br>
<p>
The point is that things break more often than not with the shuttle,<br>
even though it was custom built and is basically rebuilt after every<br>
mission, and it only flies one week missions. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But you're still talking about military aircraft, not commercial (and I'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; agree that if this were the first flight that might be a valid comparison,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I just don't think that it would be). And you're talking to someone who</i><br>
<i>&gt; worked as a military avionics designer, so I know more than a little about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the badly designed military maintenance programs that I talked about. I'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; just get into trouble if I *do* talk about them.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; There is nothing badly designed about them. They are doing their best</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with what they can get.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Precisely; and they could get a lot better for the same price, if they</i><br>
<i>&gt; speced it right in the first place.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Specs are usually right on the money when they are developed, based on<br>
the latest military theory (which may or may not be true, i.e. AA<br>
missiles making cannon and dogfights obsolete). What happens is threats<br>
change, so specs become obsolete.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, the people who were looking after the Blackbirds weren't those</i><br>
<i>&gt; geniuses, they were just normal Lockheed technicians. The main differences</i><br>
<i>&gt; (from what I've been told) were in training, motivation and longevity;</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Lockheed crew were there *because* they wanted to work on those planes</i><br>
<i>&gt; and stayed with them for years whereas the Air Force crew were just posted</i><br>
<i>&gt; there and moved on a couple of years later.</i><br>
<p>
A "normal" Lockheed technician is still much more highly trained than<br>
the average service joe, and you are right, morale and motivation have a<br>
lot to do with it, which brings up another possible cause of mission<br>
failure on an interstellar flight: depression. From space station<br>
experience we know that astronauts are at high risk for depression, and<br>
those are mere 50-180 day missions. Imagine being cooped up in a can<br>
with a couple other people for 5-10 years. What sort of slump in<br>
maintenance do you think will occur?<br>
<p>
The end of flight orbital insertion will then require a full phased<br>
inspection and rebuild for the lander. THis is the point where slipups<br>
are going to occur.<br>
