        That is exactly it...probably the intended crux of what Perry was<br>
saying in a previous post.  It is of utmost importance to acknowledge the<br>
reasons behind everything one is doing.  One has no limits or obligations.<br>
If you choose to give the bum $5, that is your personal choice...not an<br>
obligation.  If you had been so willing, you could have kept that $5 and<br>
bought something for yourself.  This translates into the way one lives from<br>
day to day.  I drive within the lines of the road because it is more<br>
beneficial to me...not simply because I am told to drive within the lines<br>
of the road.  If I so wished, I could drive in the other lane; however,<br>
that would not be beneficial to me.  The same goes for *any* situation.<br>
One must be able to acknowledge this for himself before he can truly<br>
denounce the government or any other impositions.  Once one acknowledges<br>
his true freedoms, then he can tackle the concept of alleviating the<br>
sanctioned "penalties" for ignoring rules or laws.<br>
