Dear Abraham Moses Genen:<br>
<p>
<p>
At this point, I have become quite interested in what you do. I<br>
generally consider much of my work product to be, at the very least,<br>
imperfect. You, on the other hand, seem to have a high opinion of your<br>
work product, evidenced by such statements as the following:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; During my service to the US Congress I was involved in drafting and/or</i><br>
<i>&gt; analyzing several thousand pieces of legislation that effected and</i><br>
<i>&gt; (hopefully) helped to advance the cause of social evolution. </i><br>
<p>
I would probably not say something like this, and thus, it causes me to<br>
raise an eyebrow. If the human condition needs such serious advancing,<br>
how can you ever be happy with a few scant bits of legislation? <br>
<p>
In the same post you also said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I could name more than a few pieces of legislation I helped to formulate</i><br>
<i>&gt; but it would be quite meaningless in the overall context of our continuing</i><br>
<i>&gt; social evolution. </i><br>
<p>
But you were so proud of them just a second before you wrote this. I'm<br>
genuinely puzzled. Are you trying to be inscrutable?<br>
<p>
Here's my question to you:<br>
<p>
In your estimation, what is the current state of the human condition?<br>
And in what specific direction, that is, to what specific goal do you<br>
see your work in the legislature advancing it?<br>
<p>
<p>

<p>
Hagbard<br>
<p>
<p>
P.S. What do other list members think characterizes the current human<br>
condition?<br>
