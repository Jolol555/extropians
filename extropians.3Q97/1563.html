There seems to be little question that there *are* Powers That Be and that<br>
one of the things these Powers Do is to support the circulation of<br>
attitudes and opinions in the culture that will benefit their continued<br>
existence and the augmentation of their power.  However, I question the<br>
idea that these Powers align into some monolith, all of whose interests<br>
are one and the same.  The Powers have competing interests, too, surely? <br>
The French theorist Michel Foucault (for whom I fear there is little love<br>
lost among those on the list who know of him) often insisted that when we<br>
think of power we tend to be enraptured by the image of a sovereign<br>
enacting his will through the manipulation of the world and his subjects,<br>
the image of a massive force working from the top down.  But power in<br>
modern, late modern, or postmodern societies (whichever flavor of theory<br>
you happen to subscribe to) does not function this way *at all*.  Power<br>
circulates, ramifies, from and through innumerable points at once, not so<br>
much from the bottom up, as infinite in all directions. So long as we<br>
still can't get past that sovereign notion of power, however, we tend to<br>
conceive of its workings (in the markets studied by economics, in the<br>
field of discourse studied by memetics (and rhetoricians!)) by positing<br>
the invisible hand of spontaneous order or the hidden hand of conspiracy.<br>
*Neither* the idea that the market, say, emerges in consequence of the<br>
best-possible interaction of sovereign rationally calculating homo<br>
economici in a free-flow of unimpeded information, *nor* the idea that the<br>
market is governed and manipulated by an all or even mostly powerful<br>
monolithic ruling class -- however comforting these ideas may be in the<br>
face of more troubling facts -- comes close to capturing the unholy mess<br>
of the ways in which desire, knowledge, and force fling themselves around<br>
the globe here and now and from here on out.  Best, Dale<br>
