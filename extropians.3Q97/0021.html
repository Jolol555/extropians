As I said, I manage to entertain some doubts that the recipe you describe<br>
is a reliable one.<br>
<p>
Permit me to not miss the point you're actually making, regardless of the<br>
point you think you're making:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;The arguements as to the need for self-defense against predators in our</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;society is best answered by having professionally trained law enforcement</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;officials in each community.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No doubt Marshal Petain would agree with you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Certainly Pol Pot would find your answer a winning one.</i><br>
<p>
I seem to recall that the Vichy police and their German masters were<br>
professionally trained, official, and present in the community.<br>
Your point begs the question of what right behavior is if the "officials"<br>
are the predators. Is my point now clear?<br>
<p>
As I pointed out in another post, rough parity is needed in order for<br>
cooperation to be a viable evolutionarily stable strategy. This does not<br>
imply violence, merely its capability.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I manage to entertain some doubts.</i><br>
<p>
I see no reason to change my view here: it's, if anything, more open than<br>
yours appears to be.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Each community is different. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Feel free to live wherever you are comfortable.</i><br>
<p>
I see no reason to change this view either--it strikes me as eminently<br>
tolerant. Feel free to explain why it's not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When respect for one's fellow man is strong, arms are an utter non-issue.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Absent that respect, what remains?</i><br>
<p>
No response from you on this? I rather expected more.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Dear fellow extropians and michael,</i><br>
<p>
Sarcasm! I bleed, I die! Where is my "second"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It seems there is always someone who chooses to miss the point.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Possibly, it's out of a simple need to act as devils advocate.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I somehow doubt that either Petain or Pol Pot would agree with me on most,</i><br>
<i>&gt;if not all, political issues. </i><br>
<p>
Indeed, but most is not all. Your doubt is not mine. But unilateral power<br>
corrupts, even in the short term, and there is evidence that leaving<br>
self-defense up to authorities is an invitation to same.<br>
<p>
More: Perhaps you're unaware of this, but American jurisprudence is quite<br>
clear on this point: law enforcement agencies and officers have, absent<br>
what is called a "special relationship", *no* obligation to protect<br>
citizens. None, zero, zip.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It seems that they both advocated conformity of mind and action and could</i><br>
<i>&gt;not tolerate dissent. </i><br>
<p>
Worse than that: Pol Pot reputedly had people killed because they were<br>
found to be _wearing glasses_. Intellectuals, don't you know.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The open mind indicates open discussion and debate of all issues in order</i><br>
<i>&gt;to increase human understanding. </i><br>
<p>
I was not calling you Petain or Pol, I was saying they'd agree with you. I<br>
was under the impression we were engaging in open debate--that there are<br>
(at least) two parties speaking here... but perhaps it's not open debate<br>
unless I agree with you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Shooting or otherwise killing someone does not get them to think.</i><br>
<i>&gt;In fact, the reverse is true.</i><br>
<p>
"Shooting or otherwise killing...?" Sorry, you just went into left field. I<br>
didn't even mention guns in my post. Only abuse of power and your freedom<br>
to choose to live wherever you're comfortable. And my doubts about police<br>
being perfect guardians.<br>
<p>
I did mention _arms_, but I might as well have said "tools", for they are<br>
ultimately indistinguishable.<br>
<p>
I'm concerned with helping to create a world that <br>
a) I wouldn't mind coming back to, and<br>
b) wouldn't mind bringing me back.<br>
<p>
I would mind coming back to a world where a select class of armed<br>
individuals herded human cattle around. You may now proceed to convince me<br>
that<br>
a) I'm wrong, and I'd *love* that kind of world, or<br>
b) such a world (or community) can be guaranteed not to come into existence<br>
once<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;self-defense against predators in our</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;society </i><br>
<p>
is made impossible, courtesy<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;professionally trained law enforcement</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;officials in each community.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, I beg your pardon, you did say "...best handled...". <br>
Very well, I humbly retract, I agree with you totally.<br>
<p>
MMB<br>
<p>
PS: And dental hygiene is best handled by dentists, <br>
because brushing and flossing are soooo ...*yucky*.<br>
Too bad if your teeth rot out in between appointments.<br>
