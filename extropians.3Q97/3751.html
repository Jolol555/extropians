There are a few problems with this idea, unfortunately.  One is that it<br>
would be a violation of the theory of relativity to have a teleportation<br>
device which sent information or people with an effective speed &gt; c.<br>
Even if you could do this, photons leave earth in all directions,<br>
spreading out and becoming thinly scattered.  Once you get far enough<br>
from the earth to be seeing a considerable distance into the past, the<br>
chance that a photon from earth will actually be heading your way is<br>
very small.  So the amount of information you can gather from a single<br>
vantage point is limited.  You could get around this by having a large<br>
number of observers positioned to catch many of the photons.<br>
<p>
Even without FTL travel, the idea could conceivably work.  Imagine if there<br>
were a giant mirror in space, which reflected light back towards earth.<br>
Then you could look in the mirror and see what was happening on earth in<br>
the past.  Unfortunately there are no such mirrors, but still there is<br>
matter which absorbs and re-emits photons.  Conceivably with enough<br>
computing power it might be possible to analyze the state of gas clouds<br>
and other matter and determine what photons had fallen on them in the past.<br>
<p>
This gets into Tipler's idea that a super-intelligence in the future will<br>
be able to put together all the clues it finds in its environment and do<br>
a good job of reconstructing the past, to the point where it can, as you<br>
say, give past individuals rebirth.<br>
