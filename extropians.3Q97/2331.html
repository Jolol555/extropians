How does the weakest boy in the class negotiate with a pack of 8<br>

Tossing your children into public playgrounds gives no guarantee that<br>
they will learn how to "stand their ground".  If it's a choice between<br>
doing that and hoping they come out okay, and keeping them at home and<br>
exposing them to civlized adults, I'd recommend the latter.  <br>

That seems rather too glib.  Skills should be as important as<br>
'strength', but the skills public school gave me were connected with<br>
surviving physical combat, not threading my way through civilization.<br>
<p>
I don't think a chance at learning combat survival for an hour every day<br>
(about my recess time) is worth suffering conventional education,<br>
especially in most public schools.  If adversity training is that<br>
important find some other playground or something with a low adult-kid<br>
ratio.  Or hell, drop them off at the playground of a public school<br>
during lunch.  Then your children will have the additional handicap of<br>
being strangers just popping in.  Mmmm.<br>
