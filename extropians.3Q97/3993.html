<i>&gt;&gt; Just an aside, I've always liked this particular set of gender-</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; neutral pronouns (which is why I chose to use them for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Oceania Constitution rather than the awkward ones Eric proposed),</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; but are they well-enough established here to use them without</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; explanation?  If not, could ExI or the list admins perhaps put</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; some specific mention of them in the mail list description for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; newcomers, along with other commonly-used terms here that might</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; require explanation?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (...referring to my habit of occasionally using "ey", "em",</i><br>
<i>&gt; "eir", "eirs", and "eirself" as a gender-free pronoun set.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Personally I shy away trying to designate an "official" usage</i><br>
<i>&gt; for any group.  I use this set from time to time (not</i><br>
<i>&gt; consistently) when I think I can get away with it.  I'm aware,</i><br>
<i>&gt; especially on an international mailing list such as this one</i><br>
<i>&gt; where not all readers are native speakers of English, that I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; risking being misunderstood, but I'm willing to take the risk.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If this usage is ever going to be established as a standard,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then eventually people are going to have to take the step of</i><br>
<i>&gt; using them without explanation.  I don't want to go around</i><br>
<i>&gt; beating people over the head with my personal taste in</i><br>
<i>&gt; gender-free pronouns, so I try to do it only occasionally.</i><br>
<p>
Well I certainly would never be caught dead wanting to make<br>
anything "official" by pronouncement; perhaps these half-dozen<br>
messages will suffice to introduce this set of pronouns to the<br>
group sufficiently for them to catch on without further action.<br>
And BTW, it should be "emself" rather than "eirself" (except<br>
in Mississippi, where "hisself" is normal usage :)<br>
<p>
So, by the complete lack of authority vested in me by the<br>
spontaneous order of Extropians, I recommend the continued<br>
use of these gender-free pronouns without gloss.  If anyone<br>
is confused by them, let em figure it out.<br>
