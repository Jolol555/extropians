     My largest incongruity with the classic Extropian viewpoint (as<br>
     expressed on this digest) is a seeming lack of humanity and<br>
     connectedness.<br>

     I don't think "incongruity" works here either.  It's at best a<br>
     misperception, and at worst a malicious slander.  I don't think<br>
     anyone who has ever personally been with a group of Extropians<br>
     and gotten to know them would call us anything but compassionate.<br>
     <br>
     &lt;waxes extropian and then concludes&gt;<br>
     <br>
     ...perhaps this episode will help us work on our public image a bit.<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight continues:<br>
     <br>
     Hopefully, I have not snipped out of context here in getting to the <br>
     point.  My initial quote above seems to be resurfacing in new posts, <br>
     if only for the purpose of tweakin the vocabulary &lt;G&gt;.  However, it <br>
     was not my intention to be malicious.  And as word choices, I had <br>
     hoped to disarm that interpretation by use of the word "seeming".  <br>
     <br>
     I consider extropians very intelligent and gifted people.  It is my <br>
     perception that there are more of what I would classify "engineering" <br>
     mentalities than there are say..."liberal arts" mentalities.  Of <br>
     course, my speaking emerges from the latter category as anyone who's <br>
     read anything I've posted here can readily interpret.  <br>
     <br>
     I know each group can't survive (well) without the other.  We are <br>
     polarized but dependent on one another.  A yin/yang, right-brain, <br>
     left-brain, positive/negative, zero/one opposites attract type of <br>
     thing.  When the artsy-fartsy types (like moi) get too out there, I <br>
     often NEED someone to say "Earth to Rick".  When the calculating, <br>
     empirical types reach their version of critical mass, they too need <br>
     some reconnection from "the other side".  <br>
     <br>
     This is staring to sound like Rodney King asking why we can't get <br>
     along.  I think we do merge and interpolate well and the occasional <br>
     "disturbance in the force" here in this digest is of no cause for <br>
     alarm to me and hopefully to no one else.  <br>
     <br>
     Humanity and compassion are not simply defined when you have so many <br>
     "subjective realities" to factor in &lt;G&gt;.  This digest is an <br>
     EXTRO-ordinary melting pot of ideas and perspectives.  I say it's <br>
     great.  I've learned much and hopefully contributed much.  I'd like to <br>
     make a living doing this and am paving the way for me to do so.<br>
     <br>
     Live long and prosper folks!<br>
     Rick<br>
