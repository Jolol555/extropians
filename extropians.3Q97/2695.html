I'm engaged in a debate with an old friend about libertarianism.  He has made<br>
the assertion that:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the market has never opened itself to integration without being forced to.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think this is true, but would love some help in coming up with some<br>
good examples.  The first one that comes to mind is Jackie Robinson and the<br>
general desegregation of professional sports in the U.S. in mid-century --<br>
well before the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  Any others come to mind?<br>
<p>
Of course, as I've been pointing out to my friend, it's hard to make<br>
assertions about REALLY free markets, because there have been so few examples<br>
of them.<br>
