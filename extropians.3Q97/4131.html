<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wrong.  You said: </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Our case is much different, first because we are obviously much more</i><br>
<i>&gt; complex than any microorganism or even than a frog."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; and you replied:</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Errors occur and since we are more complex the chances of errors</i><br>
<i>&gt; occurring increases"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Come on, Joao, selective amnesia really detracts from a debate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm wrong ever day, can you admit maybe your were in error, just with</i><br>
<i>&gt; once?  It would really make it easier to debate with you.</i><br>
<p>
I guess I'm what you would call, a convinced jerk. I hate being wrong,<br>
last year, a college of mine told me something like this (I don't<br>
remember the exact words): "I hate discussing with you, even when you're<br>
wrong you appear to be right." It was a great complement, it was like in<br>
Socrates' trial when the accusation said: "Socrates, the men that can<br>
make a poor argument to look like a good one." (or something like that,<br>
the idea is the same) Anyway (instead of admitting I'm wrong, I'm just<br>
praising myself), yes, it can be interpreted that I claimed human cells<br>
more difficult to cryosuspend than frog cells and microorganisms simply<br>
because they are more complex. It was a mistake, I was wrong. It wasn't,<br>
however, my intention to make it susceptible to this interpretation, my<br>
idea was, like I mention in my last message, human beings are more<br>
difficult to cryosuspend than frogs and one of the reasons is because of<br>
complexity since humans are more complex, they'll have more types of<br>
cells and the chances of errors occurring would increase and etc (I<br>
already wrote about this, no need to bother you again).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I define "perfection" as the absence of mistakes/errors. More 'perfect'</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; means with less errors. "Complexity" is harder to define, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; biology/zoology, perhaps the more functions an organism performs the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; more complex he is (including internal, cellular functions). Or perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the higher different types of proteins or cells an organism has, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; more complex he is.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What if the organism has a multitude of different proteins and cells, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are organized in a simplistic way?  I am wholly unsatisified with</i><br>
<i>&gt; this definition, and I fail to see how you can make such a concrete</i><br>
<i>&gt; biological statement based on it.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not satisfied with this definition either, I said that "complexity"<br>
is hard to define, if you have a better idea I'm all hears.<br>
I cannot think of any organism with many different types of cells and a<br>
simple organization, how do you define simple organization? Number of<br>
cells? Number of tissues?<br>
Anyway, when analyzing species like we were (frog vs. human and<br>
microorganisms vs. human), one can clearly see what is the most complex.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you think the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; functioning and abilities of your brain are "spiritual" and unknowable,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; then I cannot debate with you, because your ideas have been cemented by faith.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I don't think so, I was asking if you think so, I'm sorry if I offended</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I was not in the least bit offended, but I am a little offended that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; chose to erase and not answer my original question : "Where do you find</i><br>
<i>&gt; something "spiritual" from my phrase "functioning and abilities of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain."  Functioning and ability indicate something concrete and</i><br>
<i>&gt; studyable.  If I said "mystical powers of the brain," this would indicate</i><br>
<i>&gt; something "spiritual"  Is this just a language problem?</i><br>
<p>
No, about 93% of Americans are religious (you're Canadian right?),<br>
therefore asking for religious explanations is never a bad choice.<br>
Extropians are not known for their religious minds but perhaps you are<br>
religious (well, now it seems pretty obvious that you aren't). It was an<br>
attempt to understand your ideas, I made other attempts, I asked other<br>
questions. I didn't find anything spiritual in your sentence but that<br>
doesn't prevent me from trying what is the most common hypothesis for<br>
explaining any phenomenon, that is, religion. I missed in this attempt<br>
and, like I said before, I'm sorry if I offended you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think you have entirely missed my point.  I will give you 3 points will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; together will give you much grief:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Your brain is fragile- you will lose neurons whether you age or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. You have a finite number of neurons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Your neurons do not grow back.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. You (I assume) want to live for a long time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'll just write a citation from Leonard's Hayflick "How and Why We Age"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "A controversial question in biogerontology is whether or not we lose</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nerve cells as we age." This is from the 1994 edition, there is a 1996</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; edition with an extra chapter, I've read that chapter but I haven't read</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the rest, presumably it's the same sentence in the 1996 edition.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And yet you affirm that I lose neurons!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yep.  And I'll affirm it again: you lose neurons.  Maybe not every day,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not making any claims about that.  Remember when you reminded me of</i><br>
<i>&gt; that man who had the pole through his head, and his personality change.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you think he lost some neurons?  Do you think it was aging?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Have you ever played soccer?  Did you know that soccer players who head</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ball more have lower IQ's?  Do you think the soccer ball is just</i><br>
<i>&gt; accelerating the aging process?</i><br>
<p>
My God, I play soccer 2/3 times a week. I wonder what that means? (just<br>
kidding)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Personally I think that we lose neurons but this is just to show you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that sometimes things are not as simple as they look. IMHO, we lose</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; neurons basically because of aging.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I won't argue with that.  Sounds reasonable, but it doesn't affect my</i><br>
<i>&gt; point in the slightest.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You put an interesting question, if one doesn't age, will he lose</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; neurons (naturally, of course)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Sincerely I don't know and I bet (unless something new has been</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; discovered in the last months) you don't either.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Looks like I've discovered something new!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can see the headlines now:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "'Pole Through Head May Harm Neurons,' Says Geoff Smith, Prominent</i><br>
<i>&gt; Neuroscientist"</i><br>
<p>
I wrote:<br>
"You put an interesting question, if one doesn't age, will he lose<br>
neurons (naturally, of course)?"<br>
Is the word naturally applied to soccer? Is the word naturally applied<br>
to poles going through one's head? I don't think so. Some non-aging<br>
animals like some sharks appear not to lose any brain cells (or lose so<br>
few that it goes unnoticed). The lost of neurons is caused by aging or<br>
exceptional events (like shooting yourself in the head, taking some kind<br>
of drugs, playing soccer).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess it's a bit irrational (when you don't have any evidences and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need to draw conclusions, you use your balls right?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; No, I don't.  I find my balls are not very good at making logical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; deductions.  What do women do?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Probably nothing, it explains a lot of things (sorry, stupid joke, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; apologize immediately).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I will accept your apology on behalf of 3 billion women.  Although I'm not</i><br>
<i>&gt; sure why you would apologize, I think this tesicular deduction you speak</i><br>
<i>&gt; of may explain why there are more women in university than men. (maybe not</i><br>
<i>&gt; in Portugal, but in Canada there is)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Luckily, I am not adding to this imbalance since I do not make testicular </i><br>
<i>&gt; deductions.</i><br>
<p>
It was a joke! Don't you have any sense of humor?<br>
<p>
Speaking seriously now, it is a proven fact that women have fewer brain<br>
cells than men and that women have a smaller, lighter brain. More<br>
important, it is commonly accepted that women are less aggressive which<br>
gives them a disadvantage in most professional careers (not to mention<br>
the fact that women have to give birth).<br>
During World War 2, the British industries noticed, for the first time,<br>
the fact that women are better workers, when it comes to organization<br>
and concentration in small tasks during mass production, than men. In<br>
Portugal, the percentage of women in universities is higher than the<br>
percentage of women in the population. I think that the explanation lies<br>
in the facts observed in WW2, that doesn't make women better<br>
professionals than men, like you can witness from the winners of Nobel<br>
prizes and the facts I mentioned above, it's actually the contrary. I<br>
have an article in my site that mentions this, it's a simple "Essay on<br>
Intelligence" (<a href="http://homepage.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/science/iq.htm">http://homepage.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/science/iq.htm</a>).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; You're going to let computers become more intelligent than you?  Haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; you seen Terminator 2 ?!?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yes I did but as long as they serve us, it's ok.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why do you think that an entity *more* intelligent than you in every way</i><br>
<i>&gt; would want to serve you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Myself, being not neccessarily more intelligent than you, does not want to</i><br>
<i>&gt; serve you, so why would a more intelligent creature wish to?  </i><br>
<p>
Although there is an indirect relation between intellectual development<br>
and subversion in humans, that doesn't mean that a being of higher<br>
intelligence is more difficult to subvert, besides, there are exceptions<br>
to this relation. The only example of high intelligence that we know is<br>
our species and therefore all divagations of how an entity of higher<br>
intelligence than ours would behave are just that, divagations. If I<br>
build an entity more intelligent than myself, I'll surely find a way to<br>
control it, I can think of a million ways to do this depending on what<br>
entity we are talking about (from physical controls like drugs to<br>
psychological ones). You say that this entity is more intelligent than<br>
me in every way, do you include irrational mental capacities like<br>
determination and leadership? That might be going a bit too far, it all<br>
depends on the purpose of creating more intelligent beings.<br>
Anyway, this is pure speculations, our brain is still a huge mystery.<br>
Have you read "Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain" by<br>
the brilliant Portuguese neurologist Antonio Damasio? It's very<br>
interesting.<br>
<p>
I can't stop noticing that we are drifting a bit out of the original<br>
subject,<br>
