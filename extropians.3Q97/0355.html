<p>
I disagree strongly with this line of thought for a number of reasons.<br>
<p>
First, it is simply not true.  High-level officers *can* be held<br>
accountable for the actions of the corporation.  <br>
<p>
I find the "accountability" argument against the existence of corporations<br>
to be poor.  If a large aerospace company (say 100,000 employees) builds<br>
and sells a plane that by some definite fault of their own crashes and<br>
kills 250 people, who is liable?  In an organization that large, with<br>
thousands of people directly or indirectly responsible for the design and<br>
safety of the aircraft, how do you determine the liability of each<br>
individual?  Are mere employees directly liable for a fault of the company,<br>
or do you have to be a owner/stockholder (who usually are NOT employees) to<br>
be "directly liable"?  In either case, it is very easy to argue that<br>
*neither* the employees nor the owners/stockholders should be directly<br>
liable.    <br>
<p>
In civil cases, it makes no legal or logical sense to sue the employees of<br>
a company whose individual responsibilities are not justification for a<br>
civil suite.  Many corporate civil suites are generated by situations that<br>
are an accumulation of actions and decisions by hundreds of people that<br>
were correct in their local context but not correct in the organizational<br>
context.<br>
<p>
Corporations are not inherently evil or even bad.  They are an<br>
organizational form that has serious practical advantages for large<br>
companies.  Corporations encourage investment in business.  A corporate<br>
structure allows you to share the profits of a corporation without being<br>
responsible for the activities of individuals you cannot control (*NOTE: by<br>
legal definition of a corporate stockholder you are NOT ALLOWED to have<br>
direct control unless you are also an employee*).  The corporate liability<br>
exists so that an entity can be held responsible when no individual clearly<br>
is.  <br>
<p>
<p>
You seem to be operating under the assumption that 1) Most employees of<br>
corporations are also owners, 2) most owners are also employees, and 3)<br>
owners of corporations are in direct control of the employees.<br>
These conditions are rarely true for large companies.  And in cases where<br>
the owners are also employees with significant control, they owners *are*<br>
liable. <br>
<p>
This corporate accountability thing sounds like a version of the ever<br>
popular "Corporate Conspiracy Theory" to me.<br>
