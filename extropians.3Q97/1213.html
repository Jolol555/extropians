What about the old distinction in logical positivism between <br>
propositions true (solely) in virtue of their meaning and <br>
propositions whose truth also depend on how the world is? "There is <br>
an x such that x is the mandelbrot set." would be of the former kind <br>
(analytic); "There is an x such that x is the a galactic cluster <br>
refered to as 'the  virgo cluster'." would be of the latter kind <br>
(synthetic).<br>
<p>
Perhaps the distinction you are after is between objects such <br>
that a proposition asserting that they exist is logically true <br>
(=analytic, i.e. true independently of how the world is) and objects <br>
that don't have this property?<br>
<p>
If you reject this distinction, what are your reasons? Are you a <br>
Quinean?<br>
