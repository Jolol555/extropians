Sorry, I've been here only for two months or so.<br>
I'm still not clear who is going to manage the ICBM's in a fully privitised<br>
economy, or the battle-carrier groups stationed in the gulf for securing<br>
oil-supply (both the US and European economies depend on this as lifeblood).<br>
Are you going to give Nimitz-class carriers and stuff to Exxon?<br>
How about law-enforcement? Hey! How about legislation in the first place?<br>
Maybe I just don't grasp this as quickly as you did, having been infected<br>
with leftist memes since early childhood.<br>
<p>
I'm serious. I could be missing out on a great idea, enlighten me. Please.<br>
<p>
<p>
But whatever comes of this discussion *please* Mark, do not call me a<br>
communist or imply that I am one. For me that is one of the worst name's<br>
you could call me, extremly insulting and hurtful.<br>
I will acknowledge that the Dutch political spectrum is shifted to the left<br>
compared to the US, so if I'm center-left in Holland people will consider<br>
me a socialist in the US. That's OK, I can live with that. But never,<br>
*ever*, call me a communist Mark. I can assure you that having seen the<br>
effects of communism I hate it with a severity that would have left both<br>
General Patton and Senator McCarthy breathless. Trust me. *No one* hates<br>
communism more than I do, it's not possible.<br>
Sorry for this rant but I hope you can imagine that being called a<br>
communist evokes somewhat of a reaction inside me. Just wanted that to be<br>
clear.<br>
<p>
Respectfully,<br>
Arjen Kamphuis<br>
