<p>
How long an OS takes to boot within a 20 sec to 1 minute range, at this<br>
point in time, is irrelevant from a cost effectiveness point of view.<br>
Having a larger OS that can do more stuff makes up for a few extra<br>
seconds of boot time, and having a bigger OS that can run the<br>
applications you actually use faster than the previous version is what<br>
is real progress.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; do anything they want as long as it doesn't interfere with anothers</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; freedom.  If an individual or group of individuals grabs a bunch of</i><br>

<i>&gt; into submission, then we no longer have "anarchy" but a &gt;&gt;new form of</i><br>
<i>&gt; authoritarianism..</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;In an anarchy, every citizen will understand that their own self</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;defense is their own responsibility. THose that don't deserve their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ha.ha..Your argument here makes me giggle.. In that case, you shouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind the system &lt;we're currently living in&gt;!  Our current system of</i><br>
<i>&gt; nations, armys, laws, bureaucrats and dictatorships have all evolved to</i><br>
<i>&gt; their current state in a situation you have just advocated!</i><br>
<p>
Hardly. We have never had the chance to live in an anarchy, just varying<br>
levels of authoritarianism, monarchy, and mass tyranny. That the<br>
majority seem to prefer to live as cattle is disturbing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;As for the gas station monopolist, those are the breaks. If the gas</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;station owners did not utilize public opinion to force a curtailment or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;accommodation, its their own damn fault.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Curious.  Tell me how a small-time operator in 1919, when there was</i><br>
<i>&gt; little or no access to telephones, radio, TV or big-town newspapers,</i><br>
<i>&gt; would find the time take on the herculean task of mounting a public</i><br>
<i>&gt; opinion campaign against Rockefeller?  He would surely go out of</i><br>
<i>&gt; business in the process.</i><br>
<p>
You don't seem to know much about the period. Phones were widespread<br>
(and there was even competition in that market!) and every town had a<br>
newspaper that was the primary source of information, not nationwide<br>
talkshows or corporate faux journalism like most people waste their time<br>
on today. Additionally, literacy was higher then than it is now...<br>
People took the time to be involved in what was going on in their<br>
communities, almost always voted in every election, and attended town<br>
meetings. There was national news on newsreels that preceded movies at<br>
the local theater. Mounting a local effort to keep outsiders out was not<br>
that hard. During the 30's during the depression, when large banks would<br>
come in and buy out problematic mortgages on farms, the banks would<br>
seize the farms and auction it and all equipment off, but the locals<br>
would come in, underbid everything, at just a few dollars or less a<br>
peice, and give the equipment and land back to the farmer. The local<br>
Granges were sort of a union hall to coordinate these activities, as<br>
everyone would eventually help everyone else out. <br>
<p>
This is much the same situation small towns face today with companies<br>
like Walmart and Costco trying to move in. Some towns are successful in<br>
fighting because they think things through, prepare, and do good PR work<br>
to get the whole community behind the effort. Others who don't fight it,<br>
but only complain and sit on their butts get what they deserve.<br>
