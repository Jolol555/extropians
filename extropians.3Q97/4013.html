The general sense I get from reading cypherpunks is that this bill is<br>
unlikely to get to the floor during the current session.  No compromise<br>
is in sight to smooth the way, and there are a lot of other things on<br>
the Congressional agenda.<br>
<p>
The big fight looks to be shaping up for next year.  My guess is that<br>
supporters of restrictions will try to enlist some industry support.<br>
The sudden turnaround in Congress seems to have caught everyone by<br>
surprise, and there hasn't been much opportunity to grease the skids.<br>
They'll promise to feed business to some of the companies which tend<br>
to support restrictions, like Trusted Information Systems, HP, IBM,<br>
and others with big government contracts.  These companies will sense<br>
profit opportunities selling Big-Brother-enabled crypto software, so<br>
they may well get on board.<br>
<p>
On the other hand the computer literate press will probably oppose these<br>
restrictions just as they did with the CDA and with the Clipper chip<br>
before that.  Technical experts will probably also line up against them.<br>
Even Dorothy Denning, called in to testify in support of government access<br>
to keys (GAK), said that she did not feel that it would be safe to<br>
implement a GAK program right now; there are too many technical questions<br>
and vulnerabilities.<br>
<p>
It will come down to whether the Big Brother rhetoric of the cypherpunks,<br>
supported by a sympathetic press, can capture the public's attention well<br>
enough to overcome the FBI's trumpeting of national security.  I believe<br>
the cypherpunks have a good chance of winning the PR battle, with the<br>
press on their side.  If we can keep the congressman in a position where<br>
he either has to vote for Big Brother or vote for terrorists, there will<br>
be no vote.  So I think there is a good chance that this issue will go<br>
nowhere for some time, and we will be left with the status quo.<br>
<p>
Just my guess, your crystal ball may differ.<br>
