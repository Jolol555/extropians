<i>&gt; &gt;The pace of change is not a problem to be solved. It is a fact of life</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that human beings should synergize with.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You cannot justify your statement about the nature of the pace of change</i><br>
<i>&gt; simply by saying it a fact of life.</i><br>
<p>
Huh? I wasn't justifying anything. If you think the pace of change is a<br>
problem, then express that. If you don't think that it is a fact of life<br>
then express that as well. I'm not sure what you have a problem with in<br>
that sentence(s). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Cancer is a fact of life. Death is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact of life. Bigotry is a fact of life. They are all problems and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe they all need to be solved. I'm not necessarily disagreeing with</i><br>
<i>&gt; you, just asking you for a cogent argument.</i><br>
<p>
If you don't disagree then you don't need any argument, cogent or not.<br>
<p>
Anyway, sorry for being pedantic. <br>
<p>
The problems you cite are indeed problems. They are also facts of life.<br>
The pace of change is not a problem, but it is a fact of life. <br>
<p>
I must be missing your point because if you don't disagree then what are<br>
you doing?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I say speed them up so I can augment my inefficent physical form with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;something more capable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems a little naive to assume that increases in the pace of change, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; even continued change should allow you to do anything at all about your</i><br>
<i>&gt; form. Will you be able to afford it? Will you have access to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology? Will you even hear of the developments?</i><br>
<p>
Ancillary questions, don't you think?<br>
<p>
Whether I can opt for augmentation or not is irrelevant to the question<br>
of whether augmentation is available, no? If the pace of change is<br>
slowed, then I might not have even the option, never mind how much it<br>
costs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;The future is not a hundred, fifty or even ten years down the road.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Er, pedantic perhaps, but yes it is.</i><br>
<p>
Okay.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Well, to get there, we will have to watch as the world we know it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;entirely turned on its head.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, for _us_ to get there, we will have to be part of the process of</i><br>
<i>&gt; change. Sit around watching and I suspect you'll be just so much worm</i><br>
<i>&gt; fodder within one hundred years.</i><br>
<p>
Okay.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;You are insignificant. So am I.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is not a very Extropian attitude.</i><br>
<p>
I nearly became sarcastic. I wonder why you think so? Oh, wait, here's<br>
the reason:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We may not be owed anything by</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone but that does not have the corollary of insignificance. And if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; truly desire change, insignificant is one thing we cannot _afford_ to be,</i><br>
<i>&gt; either as individuals or as a group.</i><br>
<p>
This doesn't tell me anything about whether we are insignificant or not.<br>
Whether I can afford to be insignificant in the face of the universe is<br>
not the question I was addressing. If I am significant, then express<br>
that. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Waste your energy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;trying to fight the facts and you will indeed be dead in five years.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Fact: we're all going to die within an hundred or so years unless we do</i><br>
<i>&gt; something about it. Hmmm... personally, I think some facts are there to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; fought.</i><br>
<p>
My point, as you pointed out earlier, is that the pace of change is a<br>
fact of life. This the fact of which I speaketh. <br>
<p>
Sorry I was so unclear. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The tools for my survival are on their way.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; To people with money, and friends in high places, and influence, of whom</i><br>
<i>&gt; you and I have probably never heard. Unless we do something to involve</i><br>
<i>&gt; ourselves.</i><br>
<p>
The tools for *MY* survival are on their way. I didn't include anyone<br>
but me. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;We are, for all practical purposes, equal.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sorry, but that is completely without any basis.</i><br>
<p>
It's okay. I might be wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Do I really need to go in</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the relative chances of an American and an Ethiopian getting gene</i><br>
<i>&gt; therapy, or even decent dental treatment?</i><br>
<p>
No, I understand your point about resources, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;No one has any better chance than any other. All your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;money, all your resources may be rendered worthless at the Singularity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmmm. 'And He shall judge them one and all at the great Singularity, when</i><br>
<i>&gt; all shall be equal.' Om.</i><br>
<p>
Well said.<br>
<p>
Notice my use of the construction "may be".<br>
<p>
Are you arguing with me, or just being clever?<br>
