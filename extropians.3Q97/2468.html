Gee whiz, that sure stirred up something...<br>
<p>
At some point I had the nerve to write:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Maybe it would be worthwhile to try to break the armrace between a number</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of citizens and American law-enforcement agencies.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	that would be fine, arjen, but the fact of the matter is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;	all the cases that WaxYack or whatever his name is mentioned</i><br>
<i>&gt;	-- ruby ridge, waco, gordon kahl (i am quite familiar with all</i><br>
<i>&gt;	the above), as well as many he didn't mention -- move being the</i><br>
<i>&gt;	one that comes to mind firt  ... were all US Gov't "show cases".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	the fact of the matter is, none of the above incidents were</i><br>
<i>&gt;	precipitated by violence on the part of those which eventually</i><br>
<i>&gt;	got immolated.</i><br>
<p>
Really??? Hmmm... OK I guess I'll just have to look into this, if what you<br>
say is true: any idea why US-cops are so trigger-happy?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	your suggestion that "if americans got rid of their guns the</i><br>
<i>&gt;	gov't would have no reason to crack down on gun owners" is</i><br>
<i>&gt;	tantamount to saying that "if uppity women don't insist on their</i><br>
<i>&gt;	right to vote than the gov't won't have to crack the heads of</i><br>
<i>&gt;	suffragettes."</i><br>
<p>
I do not think that is what I meant, but in an arms-race everybody suffers<br>
a lot and the person that evetually loses, loses big-time (ask any Russian<br>
economist).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	i respect that the dutch don't own personal firearms.  i'm</i><br>
<i>&gt;	glad that it works for you.  i wager to guess that there are</i><br>
<i>&gt;	a large number of other differences between your country and</i><br>
<i>&gt;	the USA.  i suspect that looking at those differences will</i><br>
<i>&gt;	give you an idea of the REAL causes of crime, and why the USA</i><br>
<i>&gt;	suffers so much.</i><br>
<p>
That is certainly very true. For instance: over here people drive like<br>
crazy (another way to get rid of their agression?), not very smart in a<br>
country with a Pop.density of 1000+/Sq Mi. We have a LOT of traffic<br>
accidents. I've been in three serious ones myself (could also relate to my<br>
way of riding my ATB ;-).<br>
<p>
In response to Den Otters 'rant' (learn a new word every day):<br>
<p>
The Dutch judicial system pisses me off on a regular bases too, but if gun<br>
ownership in Holland is ever made 'free' I'll be taking a very long<br>
vacation to a safer place like Cambodia or Afghanistan or such since most<br>
Dutch folks are as clued up on firearms as my goldfish is on Post-Kantian<br>
ethics (not that I own a goldfish, but you get thet point). After six<br>
months or so our unemployment-rate should be nil, as well as our housing<br>
shortage.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The immigrants are responsible for a disproportionally great percentage of</i><br>
<i> &gt;crimes (what a surprise!) according to recently published police statistics</i><br>
<p>
A (yeah yeah - pinko)suggestion (sorry I have to say this):<br>
What if you relate Crime-rate to average income (immigrants are on average<br>
very poor by dutch standards)? Might be interesting. Rich people generally<br>
don't commit violent crimes - they have too much to lose.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;(there was quite a fuss about this, because the results weren't</i><br>
<i> &gt;"politically correct". The sanctimonious Dutch are *very* squeamish when</i><br>
<i> &gt;it comes to "ethnic issues", maybe even more than you guys...)</i><br>
<p>
This is what is known as our "Anne Frank Syndrome". The genocide on Jews in<br>
holland was more effective than in any other country (exept Poland) because<br>
Holland was such a neatly organized country. Of the 125.000 Jews living in<br>
Holland less than 10.000 survived the war. Ever since then being called a<br>
'racist' or 'nazi' means instant social death in Holland.<br>
<p>
Thank's to John Clark, I couldn't have said it better myself.<br>
<p>
In spite of many things (not least of wich is the 60% income tax) I<br>
wouldn't trade my Dutch passport for any other in the world. Hey, Den wanna<br>
come over for a beer or something?<br>
<p>
But all the political stuff aside, I suspect many Americans want to hold-on<br>
to their guns because they just LOVE shooting them. And (suprise, suprise,<br>
against better judgement) I must agree. On a few occassions I have had the<br>
pleasure of blasting away with an AK-47 (Pakistan), two Clock's<br>
(Switserland) and an M-16 (Wisconsin). Yes, it's fun. It's primitive.. but<br>
I can't deny it.<br>
<p>
We could say a lot more about this, but I think maybe we should do it off<br>
the list and make some room for more hard science (where on earth do y'all<br>
find the time to write all this stuff?).<br>
<p>
Just to warm some 'All American' hearts (but no less sincere!)<br>
<p>
Thank you America:<br>
For doing in Bosnia what Europe should have done in '93<br>
For Winning the Cold War for us<br>
For paying for that (Well, 90% anyway)<br>
For ending a World War (1945)<br>
For ending a World War (1918)<br>
For the Wright Brothers<br>
For the Telephone<br>
For kicking England out of America (Ha! serves them right for stealing<br>
manhattan from the Dutch ;-)<br>
<p>
Don't abolish the US state yet, whimpy European politicians need it to sort<br>
out their mess every 20 years or so.<br>
