Well, *is* there a new species here?  If members of the two sisters species<br>
can and did mate, producing well-adapted and perfectly fertile offspring,<br>
were the two really separate species in the first place?  Speciation really<br>
isn't an all-or-nothing kind of thing, and this is treading in a grey area.<br>
 Scientists, ecologists, and bureaucrats spend a lot of time arguing over<br>
such things as whether the California Gnatcatcher is a separate species from<br>
the Mexican one, or just a separate sub-species.<br>
<p>
There was an isolation of sorts, that which produced the two sister species,<br>
or sub-species, or whatever.  If the isolation that made the sister species<br>
was not adequate to avert fully fertile interbreeding then generally they are<br>
considered merely sub-species and expected to merge, and the resulting merger<br>
is just an evolution from the original species, not a new species.  But this<br>
is just definition (and frequently ignored if one of the subspecies has<br>
environmental interest lobbying for it).<br>
<p>
There's one case, I read, where an apparently new species of grass in North<br>
America is thought to be a hybrid between a North American and an imported<br>
species that appear to be not fertile, at least normally.  This case would<br>
indeed meet your definition.  In general plants are more tolerant of distant<br>
outbreedings than animals.<br>
