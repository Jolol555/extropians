 Ev, if you run into the monsters doing this stuff... <br>
     do just that: run into them - full speed.<br>
<i> &gt;&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
This is of particular significance and interest to me.  For the ten years<br>
prior to getting into my truck I was intimently associated with kidney<br>
dialysis, and kidney disease.  My wife and her mother both died of End Stage<br>
Kidney Disease.  You cannot live without your kidneys for very long.....that<br>
time is measured in hours.  You cannot live with a transplant or dialysis for<br>
a normal lifetime....It WILL be cut short.  <br>
<p>
These people are murderers....pre-meditated murders.  In my opinion it is no<br>
difference than if they outright killed their victims on the scene.  The only<br>
difference is the "torture factor".....they not only murder their victims<br>
they impose physiological and psychological torture on them in their<br>
remaining period of life....because their victims health will go into<br>
immediated decline...<br>
<p>
I'm no doctor....but urologists and kidney docs explained to me about<br>
transplants...it is much similar, in effect, to inducing AIDS by chemical<br>
means...that is... the immune system of the victim must be suppressed in<br>
order to prevent rejection of the transplant....this makes disease and ill<br>
health a certainity over the long term.<br>
<p>
<p>
This is horrible.<br>
