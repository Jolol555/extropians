Such a flamboyant dichotomy may get people's attention, but not their<br>

Actually I don't remember any discussion of recent welfare reform on<br>
this list.  We call ourselves libertarian, but apparently don't get too<br>
excited over poor-welfare.  Wise, considering the small size of the dole<br>
relative to corporate, military-industrial, or above all old folks<br>
welfare.  Society recently has in fact been saying 'Get to work wage<br>
slaves!', but over long time we've moved toward shorter work weeks.<br>
To think we gave up the 60-80 hour week so that Americans could spend<br>
4-5 hours a day watching TV.  I don't think the somnolent society is<br>
inherently impossible.<br>

For that matter, Imperial Rome ran on bread and circuses.  The bread was<br>

 <br>
The Roman dole is one option.  The shifting of people into more creative<br>
endeavors, so that the automated part of the economy is a small<br>
part of the whole, is another.  You missed my point about the farmers,<br>
perhaps: One of the fundamental economic activities has been largely<br>
automated (apart from luxury activites like berry-picking.)  Instread of<br>
97% of the population it takes 3%.  But the descendants of displaced<br>
farmers have found, or made, other roles.<br>
<p>
I can't tell you how the next generation will adapt; the complexity of<br>
modern civilization eludes my detailed grasp, which is one of the more<br>
pragmatic arguments for mostly free markets: no one really knows what<br>
they're doing, and there aren't many experimental subjects.  But while<br>
you're welcome to be worried, I don't think the choices are Singularity<br>
or death.<br>
<p>
Unless we've already been through a Singularity.  Imagine moving an 1850<br>
farmer into modern Manhattan.<br>
<p>
} Please, I hate to enter into it with you, because I know who i am <br>
} arguing with, but how can someone be poor AND rich at the same time?<br>
<p>
Well, how can someone be rich and ppor at the same time?  You'd think<br>
Augustus, or Montezuma, or many Chinese emperors, were rich, wouldn't<br>
you?  Now start making a list of things that you have which they<br>
couldn't possibly have.  Glass windows, a good chance of living into<br>
your seventies, fruit from New Zealand, ethnic restaurants, access to<br>
more knowledge than they could imagine, hiking boots... admittedly<br>
emperors have a few advantages, such as the ability to boss people<br>
around and thus first dibs on whatever food is around, even in famine.<br>
And perhaps more leisure time.<br>
<p>
But hopefully you get the point.  The Americans most usually called poor<br>
are absolutely rich in access to some medical care (even if it's the<br>
emergency room) and diversity of food choices, plus TV and access to<br>
public libraries.  In the sense that they have to work hard just to make<br>
a living, though, I'll grant that they're genuinely poor in a sense.  <br>
However I think much of the woes of the troubled middle class stem from<br>
watching too much advertising, or remembering the 1950s (when the US had<br>
no effective competition) too well.  People can't afford to replace<br>
their car every few years, or all the medical techniques which have been<br>
discovered but not made economical.<br>
<p>
One legitimate part is that as people need to be educated, so parents<br>
feel responsible for educating their children, which is expensive.  One<br>
hopes that this will lead to fewer children.<br>
<p>
Two perspectives from Southern California.  Some time ago gasoline<br>
prices shot up a fair bit, due to accidental disabling of several local<br>
refineries (California can't import its gas because of stricter<br>
standards).  There was much wailing and gnashing of teeth.  I looked<br>
into things (I don't have a car) and discovered that prices had gone up<br>
from $1.30 to $1.60, or maybe $1.80 a gallon.  Assuming 20 miles per<br>
gallon and 20 mile commutes it seems to me we're talking about an<br>
annual increase of a few hundred dollars.  Doesn't seem like too much to<br>
me, but people were really upset.  Point?  People's feelings of relative<br>
harm seemed far greater than the objective harm I could see.<br>
<p>
I live next to San Marino, one of the richest areas in the world.  I go<br>
for walks there sometimes, and am struck by the hourses and estates, and<br>
by envy of their owners.  How unfair that people should have such<br>
things, and not me!  But I, obviously, am one of the digitally educated,<br>
and it'd be silly of me to whine about how poor I am in general.  I<br>
think that's a large part of the plight of the American middle class; no<br>
sense of perspective.<br>
<p>
Solutions?  Spread education, and hope.<br>
<p>
Merry part,<br>
