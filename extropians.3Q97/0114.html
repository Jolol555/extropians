&lt;&lt; I was referring to reprogramming those people currently deemed<br>
"incorigable"<br>
 or "beyond help", like chain murderers, the mentally ill, etc.  I didn't<br>
mean<br>
 that anyone would have a carte blanche to reprogram anyone who doesn't think<br>
 in any particular way.  What would you prefer to offer someone, jail,<br>
 execution, or just reprogramming of the violent / stupid / whatever part of<br>
 their brain?  Personally, I think a violent person would thank you after the<br>
 reprogramming because they'd realize how much better life is when they<br>
aren't<br>
 so violent, and they didn't even need to become a vegetable as would occur<br>
in<br>
 a labotomy. &gt;&gt;<br>

Reprogramming wouldn't make completely different people.  We could increase<br>
intelligence and give these people the ability to look back at what they've<br>
done and see the error in their ways.  However, we could only enhance these<br>
people in the hope that they might be able to correct themselves.<br>
 Reprogramming them to fit in with some notion of a 'good citizen' you or I<br>
may have would be a bad idea (espicially if under government control).<br>
