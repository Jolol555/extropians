Yes, what *is* happening to this list? As soon as you post something<br>
slightly controversial you get a knee-jerk holier than thou reaction<br>
like this. I really was hoping we could discuss racism and related<br>
issues on this list, which is supposed to offer intelligent discussion<br>
on just about any topic.<br>
<p>
Anyway, let me clarify what I meant (a part of it at least).<br>
Contrary to popular (or rather: media) "belief" racism is not (only)<br>
about the colour of eyes, skin or hair. Example:kindergarten kids call<br>
the redhead names because he/she is different, but when they all<br>
grow up they won't think that the "different" redhead is (mentally)<br>
inferior. And he/she isn't of course, you can't afawk tell intelligence<br>
by the colour of hair or eyes. Skin, and facial features etc. are<br>
something different. They _can_ be (*generally speaking*) an <br>
indication of cultural advancement and general "intelligence"/or the<br>
lack of it. By looking at a person you can *usually* tell with reason-<br>
able accuracy what the level of education etc is. Now if one sees a<br>
black person the general reaction will be one of suspicion and <br>
unease, often a feeling of superiority (this is _not_ "racist nonsense"<br>
but a cold hard fact. All races distrust others, it's a gene thing, and<br>
*all races* look down on negroes. The Arab, the Asian, the Caucasian,<br>
the native American...just listen carefully on the bus, in the mall, on<br>
the street...or just ask someone you know to be *really honest* about<br>
it).<br>
<p>
"Prejudice" as the media like to call it is often simple rational thinking.<br>
The facts: the whole of central and southern Africa hasn't produced<br>
an even remotely technolological "modern civilization". Fact: they did<br>
not even invent the wheel or bow and arrow. Unlike for example native<br>
Americans they did not adapt when confronted by white (Boer) settlers<br>
and were crushed (while the American natives were primarily defeated<br>
by "alien" diseases like smallpox). Black Africans have been favoured as<br>
slaves since ancient times, because they were often well built and<br>
none too bright. They *are* generally less in control of their<br>
emotions...the list goes on and on. It's really too bad for the blacks, but<br>
history and present day reality are rather harsh judges. There is no<br>
"justice" in nature, just in our heads. <br>
<p>
Now if you really want to help you have to acknowledge the problem<br>
first. And of course there are plenty of smart, kind and "civilized" <br>
blacks equal or even better than many whites, but...a) they are often<br>
of mixed race, so "genetically enhanced" and no longer real "blacks"<br>
b) they could fully develop themselves only because they grew up in a<br>
white "civilized" culture that is reasonably supportive (certainly when<br>
compared to a primitive tribe) of critical thinking, science etc.<br>
Believe me, these modern blacks don't feel much of a "bond" with <br>
their less advanced congeners. And why would they...mental<br>
properties are after all more important than looks...right?<br>
<p>
Now about the meme thing: do you honestly belief that "all memes <br>
are equal"? If so, why aren't you over at Christian chat or Commytalk?<br>
After all...it's all the same thing.<br>
<p>
Now can you get off of that moral high horse and discuss *reality*,<br>
or do you prefer to remain an upstanding politically correct member<br>
of the community?<br>
<p>
P.s. I am not more racist than any person who reads this, just more<br>
realistic and honest.<br>
<p>
