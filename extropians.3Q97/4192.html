<i>&gt; The free market punishes stupidity and inefficiency.  This is good.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; it also fails to reward producing information for free, or exploration,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which is bad if people need that reward to live.  Copyright fills in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; gap, but less than ideally, because it makes information not free for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; while.</i><br>
<p>
That's the "public good" argument; I don't buy it for things like<br>
defense, and I see no reason to buy it for information.  The claim<br>
that the free market does not reward production of free information<br>
absent copyright is manifestly false: anyone with a little imagination<br>
can figure out dozens of ways to make money with information that<br>
don't rely on copyright--I've posted many here already, as anyone can <br>
look up in the archives.  Beginning an argument with with such an<br>
instance of philospher's diease (mistaking a failure of imagination<br>
for an insight into necessity) weakens whatever follows.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is there a fix?  And is it reachable from current society?  I dunno.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But this is what I've been getting at.</i><br>
<p>
Where old institutions fail, the fix is new institutions.  To create<br>
the new business models for information business no longer subsidized<br>
by copyright, its current beneficiaries must lead by example and<br>
refuse the subsidy, and create those new business models for themselves.<br>
<p>
The difficulty in fighting it politically is the same for fighting<br>
any subsidy for what people think is a good thing.  The political<br>
reality is that if people think that farming is a good thing, then<br>
they think that subsidzing farmers might be good.  Likewise if they<br>
think producing information is good, then subsidizing it must be OK.<br>
You have to fight that by showing the real consequence of subsidies--<br>
taking money away from what might have been a more productive use.<br>
<p>
The state-enforced protection of information takes away billions of<br>
dollars from productive use: school textbooks cost more than twice<br>
what they would without it, the cost of legal research severely<br>
hampers justice, every industry is crippled by not being able to<br>
make small incremental improvements without major cost.<br>
<p>
Copyrights and Patents reward novelty at the expense of craftsmanship,<br>
and we allow this because our culture seems to think that intelligence<br>
is somehow "better" than physical skill, or that invention is somehow<br>
more noble and deserving than labor.  That's nothing but snobbery; a<br>
cultural bias with no legitimate excuse.  Every producer must must<br>
offer eir product in the free market with every other.  Authors and<br>
inventors should have no special protection.<br>
