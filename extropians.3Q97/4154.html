Certainly.  My complaints are not based on my concern with surviving,<br>
per se.  My complaints are based on my preference to be doing other<br>
things than worrying about my survival, combined with a feeling that my<br>
needs -- food, housing, utilities, cheap clothes, libraries, and public<br>
transit within a city -- shouldn't be much to ask of society.<br>
Admittedly I'm not working that much either, so perhaps the system is<br>
working.  But I'm a functioning programmer.  I'd be happy if society had<br>
more historians, marine biologists, and jungle explorers.  Producers of<br>
non-commercial information, in other words.  Which raises the question<br>
of feeding these people.  Conversely, there are people writing books<br>
which aren't worth much.  If they're hacks exploiting an easy market,<br>
then I'd be better off if they were just fed so that they wouldn't feel<br>
the need to pollute the bookstores.<br>

<p>
Yes, but when I think of "those that cannot compete as well" I'm not<br>
thinking compassionately of the downtrodden and uneducated; I'm thinking<br>
selfishly of scientists and obscure writers and GNU programmers.  I'm<br>
thinking that our system measures success as the ability to collect<br>
money, representing scarce goods, but what I value these days is<br>
information, which is not scarce, once produced.  But the leisure to<br>
produce it may be scarce.  I'm thinking that P.C. Hodgell is far more<br>
important to me than Bill Gates, but she has to work on a non-Kencyr<br>
book because publishers won't touch her main series, and she can't<br>
afford to write it for love because she needs to eat, while Bill Gates<br>
is worth N billion because our intellectual property laws guarantee him<br>
money everytime Microsoft software is copied.<br>
<p>
I'm suggesting that we might be rich enough to use machines to provide a<br>
minimum level of living to everyone, and not stigmatize them for it, and<br>
count on people's not wanting to feel useless or bored to keep them<br>
doing something which might be useful now or later, or just<br>
interesting.  And if we're not that rich, perhaps becoming so should be<br>
one of our shorter term goals.  Might hasten the Singularity, for those<br>
of you that count the days to that.<br>
<p>
(Might _be_ a Singularity, from some points of view.)  (At any rate, it<br>
might give Max more time to work as ExI, if he wanted. :)<br>
<p>
I'm not arguing for laws.  I don't know what the Culture looks like<br>
economically, or how they deal with people who like breeding a lot -- or<br>
rather, with the presumed evolutionary selection for such people.  I'm<br>
just trying to perhaps change people's attitudes.  <br>
<p>

<p>
Is free market evolution selecting for what we want?  I want knowledge<br>
and art to be produced and gathered.  I don't think I'm alone in this.<br>
I want to gather knowledge myself, and hopefully produce some.  What I<br>
see is Microsoft with billions of dollars, and GNU slipping by on<br>
contributors' spare time.<br>

You want to teach them how to make money.  I don't think money and<br>
information should mix, directly, and I'm worried about the information.<br>
