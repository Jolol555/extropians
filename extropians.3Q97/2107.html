Dale Carrico says-<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[...]Michel Foucault [...] often insisted that when we</i><br>
<i>&gt;think of power we tend to be enraptured by the image of a sovereign</i><br>
<i>&gt;enacting his will through the manipulation of the world and his subjects,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the image of a massive force working from the top down.</i><br>
<p>
I've just read Bruno Bettelheim's (1974?) _The Uses of Enchantment_.<br>
It's about what fairy tales have evolved to do for kids' minds.<br>
One of the many thought-provoking things Bettelheim says is<br>
that becoming King represents gaining soveriegnty over one's own life.<br>
That makes it more clear for me why stories about powerful people--<br>
Presidents, big businessmen, mafia bosses, army generals, etc.--like<br>
_Air Force One_, are so popular.  "Get off my plane!" says Mr. Prez in<br>
the trailer for that one, and I understand him to mean symbolically:<br>
"Get out of my life, disorder!"<br>
<p>
Although I reject centralized power as a way to run one's mind, and in<br>
fact I've always been turned off by some libertarians' (IMHO) over-<br>
emphasis on logic and rationality, still I have a lot more sympathy for<br>
this symbolism (autocrat = autonomy) than I do for plain power worship.<br>
In some sense we are *rightly* enraptured by power.  It's an essential<br>
nutrient.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But power in</i><br>
<i>&gt;modern, late modern, or postmodern societies (whichever flavor of theory</i><br>
<i>&gt;you happen to subscribe to) does not function this way *at all*.  Power</i><br>
<i>&gt;circulates, ramifies, from and through innumerable points at once, not so</i><br>
<i>&gt;much from the bottom up, as infinite in all directions.</i><br>
<p>
"Bottom-up," in terms of structure of things someone is studying, just<br>
means flowing from the scattered details to the overall visible patterns<br>
and trends.  "Surely" (Dale, I love that word; I want to use it, too!)<br>
power is fractal--having details and concentrations at different levels<br>
and scales--like everything else.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;*Neither* the idea that the market, say, emerges in consequence of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;best-possible interaction of sovereign rationally calculating homo</i><br>
<i>&gt;economici in a free-flow of unimpeded information,</i><br>
<p>
Just because economists use simplified models doesn't mean they think<br>
the world is perfect or simple!  Like point masses in perfect vacuum,<br>
perfect economic actors in a perfect economic fluid are easier to<br>
analyze, that's all.  There are also analyses of perfectly stupid&amp;<br>
ignorant actors, and analyses of "transaction costs" (=messiness)<br>
abound.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;*nor* the idea that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;market is governed and manipulated by an all or even mostly powerful</i><br>
<i>&gt;monolithic ruling class -- however comforting these ideas may be in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;face of more troubling facts -- comes close to capturing the unholy mess</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the ways in which desire, knowledge, and force fling themselves around</i><br>
<i>&gt;the globe here and now and from here on out.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that visions of central control (whether by individuals,<br>
governments, conspiracies, ideas, markets...), even when described with<br>
horror, are often the result of a kind of romance with power.<br>
<p>
But I wouldn't romanticize a vision of *de*centeredness.  That's just<br>
different blinkers.  Also, I don't get what Power, with a capital P as<br>
Foucault used it, means if not central power.  He seemed to mean something<br>
other than the everyday power we all use to move about in the world.<br>
