Michael:<br>
<p>
OK, now I understand where things stand.<br>
<p>
It's always a pleasure to meet another "experienced gambler"<br>
--unless you both happen to be sitting at the same table. :)<br>
<p>
Maybe my crew chief was embellishing, maybe not--but he was there,<br>
and the fact that, e.g., supply planes or P3s come in that heavy <br>
is not at all the same thing as operating squadrons of jets that<br>
have similar loads. But OK, you may be right--gee, after all <br>
that development, why wasn't the B variant fielded? <br>
Because it turned out to be a bad idea. There is no intrinsic<br>
shame in that, but there was pork in the process that led<br>
to a "large turning radius". That was my intended point.<br>
<p>
I know there are aerospace success stories, and I know how <br>
they sometimes get scotched, too--see the rise and fall of <br>
the DC-X, and NASA's lame "oh, gee, don't know where we <br>
can scrape up money" story. There are none so blind...<br>
<p>
By the way, the real aces up my sleeve were aircraft <br>
such as Paraplanes *and* the fact that I said <br>
"'til failure" of either the airframe or the powerplant.<br>
Run an RPV into the ground and your maintenance hours <br>
could be _zero_. :) <br>
<p>
Darn, there goes my free Zoche. :)<br>
<p>
Anyway: it's down to your believing that we're such a hot <br>
radio item that our first visitors will (/have) come in the first<br>
thing they can bolt together that will make the trip. Correct?<br>
<p>
Plus you believe that operating hours for space vehicles <br>
_must_ be roughly equivalent (re: wear) to our experience <br>
with aircraft operating near our turbulent, corrosive little <br>
rockball under the political pressures we both acknowledge <br>
exist here in the good ol' US of A.<br>
<p>
Can't prove you're wrong, old son; but you gussy it up like it<br>
was more than a guess. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That we</i><br>
<i>&gt;succeed in spite of politicians and bureaucrats says volumes about</i><br>
<i>&gt;engineers.</i><br>
<p>
Amen to that.<br>
MMB<br>
