<i>&gt; THE PRIMARY QUESTION of logical inquiry </i><br>
<i>&gt; Must be "what is identity?" </i><br>
<p>
Actually, that's THE SECONDARY QUESTION.  <br>
THE PRIMARY QUESTION must be "Hey, is this thing on?"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Until we answer </i><br>
<i>&gt; That question, all other inquiry is illogical.  </i><br>
<p>
...and therefore naughty.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A thing, a state of difference, A, is an identity.  </i><br>
<p>
Well, yes, obviously that.  I mean, if we can't agree that A is an<br>
identity, a state of difference, a thing, then what can we agree on? <br>
Nothing, I'd say.  (Oops!  I'm jumping ahead!)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Every identity is derived from relation.  </i><br>
<p>
You are your own grandfather.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is no identity that is not derived from relation.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; There can be no identity that is not derived from relation.  </i><br>
<p>
Except for "Manos" (The Hands of Fate).  Manos has no derivation.  Manos<br>
just is.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Therefore "relation" cannot be separated from "identity,"  </i><br>
<p>
Not without the Jaws of Life, anyway.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And therefore, as relation contains both A and not-A, </i><br>
<p>
...and not-both-A...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What a thing is said not to be cannot truthfully </i><br>
<i>&gt; Be separated from what it is said to be.  </i><br>
<p>
(See Jaws of Life comment above.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The assumed separation of A and not-A is therefore </i><br>
<i>&gt; A fallacy. </i><br>
<p>
...and even more naughty than illogical inquiry.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If A is not separate from not-A, </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then A is not-A: </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   A = not-A </i><br>
<p>
Or, more elegantly:<br>
<p>
A !=&lt;&gt;= !A + some_other_stuff<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; If there is nothing A is not, A is everything.</i><br>
<p>
Including pasties.  Maybe even especially pasties.  (Woo hoo!)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If A is everything, A is no thing, A is nothing, </i><br>
<i>&gt; And thus everything is nothing... Logical Zen.</i><br>
<p>
But what is nothing?  Something?  A nice snack?  (Yes, thank you.  A donut<br>
if you have one.)   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So the answer to the primary question as to the nature </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of identity is that identity is nothing,  </i><br>
<p>
Actually, the answer to the real primary question (see comments above) is,<br>
"Yes, it is."  Not that your question/answer isn't also profound.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; identity is </i><br>
<i>&gt; False where it assumes separation, and that is true.  </i><br>
<p>
Truth is that separation assumes, where it is false, identity is.  Just ask<br>
Yoda.  <br>
(See <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3109/newgammar.html">http://www.theonion.com/onion3109/newgammar.html</a> for more profundity.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Identity is not identity, different is same.</i><br>
<p>
Any 10 year old could tell you this.  But I'm glad you said it, anyway, so<br>
the elderly on the list might also benefit, and grow thereby.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Separation does not exist. </i><br>
<p>
Unless you really, really believe in it with all your heart.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No thing is apart from the whole. </i><br>
<p>
Now you're getting personal!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Every thing is the whole. </i><br>
<p>
And now you're being rude!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Everything is whole.</i><br>
<p>
Oh.  Well, that's not so bad, I guess.  If you'd ended all of that with<br>
everything being torn asunder and strewn about, we'd have quite a logical<br>
mess to clean up.  Your tidiness and manners are greatly appreciated.<br>
<p>
P.S.  Sorry for the "Me, too." post.  I'll try to have more to add next<br>
time!<br>
