Perhaps, but as far as I know no other primates (not merely apes)<br>
display the whole range of adaptations (voluntary breath control,<br>
metabolic dive reflex, downward-turned nostrils, streamlined hair<br>
patterns, neonatal swimming ability, extensive subcutaneous fat,<br>
all of which are of unquestionable advantage to a wading/diving<br>
lakeshore animal).  Add in the several other unique traits of Homo<br>
sapiens that may have been of advantage in an aquatic environment,<br>
such as bipedalism, semihairless skin, and possibly modified coital<br>
position, and Ockham's razor starts cutting into your suggestion<br>
rather deeply.<br>
<p>
Can you name one other primate, even a very "primitive" one,<br>
that displays even three of these aquatic adaptations? It seems<br>
unlikely that such a large array of distinct adaptations could<br>
have developed as a group in some common ancestor of very many<br>
species, and then be systematically eliminated from all of the<br>
descendant species except one, which preserved so many. If one<br>
species preserved so many aquatic adaptations, then it would<br>
seem very unlikely for selective pressure to have wiped out the<br>
whole suite of adaptations in the cousins without any vestigial<br>
remainder. Vestigial remainders are fairly common in mammals<br>
generally, so it seems that when evolution wipes out a trait, it<br>
rarely does so without leaving a trace.<br>
