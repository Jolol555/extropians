I'm not sure how fundamental the question is about whether there is only<br>
a finite number of possible "islands".  Given that we are dealing with<br>
a parameter space where the parameters are real numbers, even a single<br>
tiny island may admit an infinite number of possible sets of parameters.<br>
Would there be some inherent quantization of parameters such that<br>
changing the mass of an electron by a sufficiently small amount would<br>
make literally zero difference?  Maybe if you consider<br>
delta E * delta T &gt; hbar, then if delta E were small enough that delta T<br>
would have to be longer than the age of the universe, this would be true.<br>
<p>
It also seems possible (despite what I said earlier) that only a limited<br>
range of possible parameter values will admit life.  Maybe the mass<br>
of the electron could be large enough that there are no atoms, and we<br>
could still have life in other forms, but could it be infinitely large?<br>
Could all parameters increase without limit?  Seemingly the only way<br>
there could be an infinite number of islands would be if the set of<br>
legal parameters included (virtually) infinite values.<br>
