Pardon my casual descriptions, but I'm not a physicist.  <br>
<p>
It's probably more accurate to say that FTL travel is meaningless, rather<br>
than just impossible.  As you go faster, the universe gets smaller.  To a<br>
photon, the entire universe is just one point.  Go faster, and the universe<br>
is imaginary.  You have nowhere to come from and nowhere to go.<br>
<p>
If, hypothetically, it were possible to get from one point without travelling<br>
(the wormhole concept), it would be trivial to set up grotesque paradoxes.<br>
 For example, you "pop" from A to B, where a big bomb is about to go off. You<br>
can set up an observer C who will see you get the before the bomb and get<br>
blown to bits, while D sees you get there after and search the wreckage.<br>
 This kind of thing was the basis of a whole bevy of clock paradoxes which<br>
were thought to "disprove" relativity.  The way relativity works, however,<br>
everybody always agrees on the sequence of events at a given point.  But this<br>
requires that the only way to get from one place to another is by mundane<br>
travel.<br>
