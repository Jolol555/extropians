Hmmph.  I can't remember your original post in detail.  I grant that<br>
the younger Western population will have a higher fraction of people <br>
comfortable with computers and exotic applications thereof.  Including<br>
AIs and uploads.  I'm sure this isn't universal (in our generation) and<br>
I doubt it's even a majority.  (A majority might be comfortable with<br>
using Macs or Windows.)  The fraction who would regard a Vingean<br>
Singularity with enthusiasm is, I suspect, still minuscule.  It may be<br>
much larger than the fraction of older people, but it is still small.  I<br>
base this on my general knowledge of attitudes at Caltech, not one of<br>
the bastions of Luddism.  I'm not sure about the fraction which would<br>
believe a Singularity is inevitable or even possible.<br>
<p>
} What is the "Culture", and who is this author whose books I clearly need to buy?<br>
 <br>
I think you've been skipping through some of my posts :) ; I've been ranting<br>
about the Culture for a while now.  It's an extropian society, near<br>
Utopia, by an anarcho-socialist author, Iain M. Banks.  What I haven't<br>
mentioned before is that the universe has two of what I'd consider<br>
Singularities.  There's the realistic one -- nano, AI, genofixing -- and<br>
a made up one, Subliming.  Compare _Marooned in Realtime_: the high<br>
techs were hard for Wili to understand, but the human race had<br>
disappeared as well.<br>

Go to SubCulture, go to "A Few Notes on the Culture", by Banks himself.<br>

} The former sounds like a simple failure of imagination.  The latter depends on<br>
} Power Ethics, which I'm tired of talking about.  Flip a coin.<br>
 <br>
Upgrade at leisure, although that's not how I thought Kadath ended.<br>
As for Power Ethics... civilized humans made civilized human+ AIs which<br>
made civilized human++ AIs which made... civilized Minds.<br>
<p>
Conceptions of the Singularity sometimes seem to involve a single<br>
runaway mind, a la Kadath or the Blight taking over High Lab.  Part of<br>
the Culture is, I think, the applicability of peer pressure at all<br>
levels, reinforcing whatever ethics were inherited from before.<br>

 <br>
You extrapolate from a millenium to "always"?  30 doublings is only a<br>
billion, anyway.  Hardly enough time to conclude that there are no<br>
limits to progress.<br>
<p>
Moore's Law applies to fab plant costs as well, does it not?<br>
