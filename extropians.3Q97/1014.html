heard any of the music of that &gt; genre coming from Italy (like Gigi<br>
D'Agostino, RAF by Picotto, etc.) or from other artists like Brainbug &gt;<br>
(with Nightmare), Red 5, BBE, Caf=E9 Del Mar, or Moonman (with Galaxia).  Al=<br>

these sounds are very fresh &gt; and probably better than Faithless.  One cd I<br>
highly recommend but is nearly impossible to find (I &gt; bought it in Italy)<br>
is Voyage '96 with various artists.  I find that the U.S. usually lags 6 to<br>
9 months &gt; behind Europe with this kind of music (the first time I heard<br>
Insomnia was January '96 in Italy).<br>
<p>
"Stale" is subjective, but I frequently have to wade through 20 CDs to find<br>
one that grabs my attention.  I agree that there is a little lag time as<br>
far as distribution goes, but most of it is perceived rather than actual.<br>
Music distributors in this country generally don't care about a these<br>
genre's because they don't sell well in the U.S.  Its not that it isn't<br>
available, its just really difficult to find.  Fortunately, electronica is<br>
becoming more popular in the US, which may help remedy the situation.<br>
