   I'm going to make the bold proposal that *The collapse of the World <br>
Economy is inevitable".  Before I support that claim, I want to add <br>
further that unless we reach the Singularity as soon possible (as Eliezer <br>
S. Yudkowsky suggests - see <br>
<a href="http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html#interim">http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html#interim</a>), most of humanity, including many on this list, will experience <br>
enormous suffering and possibly death.  I give you a dialog:<br>
<p>
'Why?!" you may ask.<br>
<p>
Because Free-Market Economics is GOOD for COMPANIES (fictitious legal <br>
entities and BAD for PEOPLE (very real entities).<br>
<p>
'How can you say that?!  The economy is doing great, the stock market <br>
is at an all-time high, unemployment is at a 30yr low, inflation is low, <br>
and corporate profits are up!'<br>
<p>
Yes. That is correct.  Like I said,  free-market economics is good for <br>
corporations, bad for people'.<br>
<p>
'But unemployment is very low - *that* is good for people.'<br>
<p>
Are you sure about that?  How do you explain then that most people are <br>
working harder than ever before just to make ends meet?  Real wages <br>
adjusted for inflation have been sinking for 25 years.  Full-time benefited <br>
employment is decreasing at a dramatic rate, only to be replaced by <br>
part-time and temporary work.  A recent poll showed that over 70% of <br>
working Americans feel they have less job security than ever before, are more <br>
stressed out on the job, and are overworked.  The 40-hour workweek is <br>
more like the 50 and 60-hour workweek for more and more people.  This low <br>
unemployment has another ruthless edge called the free-market whose <br>
greatest success is driving innovation.<br>
<p>
'But innovation is great!  Its what gives us all of the great <br>
technologies that allow us to follow our extropic dreams.'<br>
<p>
Yes.  Innovation has been great for many people.  I can't imagine what <br>
I would do without my computer.  Unfortunately it is this very <br>
innovation that will collapse the free-market from which it was born.  The <br>
free-markets greatest success will be its greatest undoing.<br>
<p>
'Please explain.'<br>
<p>
If you remember back about 30 years ago, most futurists saw cybernated <br>
automation as the great savior of us all.  A world of ubiquitous <br>
automation, they argued, would free us from many of the toils of compulsory <br>
work and servitude.  Work will become an option to exercise your creative <br>
and intellectual muscles.  Now here we are, 30 years later, and look at <br>
the mess it has created.  Instead of relieving us from wage-slavery, it <br>
has instead increased the pace of the 'rat race'.  People are running as <br>
fast as they can just to stay in the same place!  Again, more job <br>
insecurity, less pay, massive layoffs, and widespread societal discontent.  <br>
The only ones that are happy about all this are the few who scored it big <br>
in the 80's on savvy real-estate deals, executive pay-raises and <br>
lucrative stock options.  But let us don't forget those brash young <br>
cyber-geeks in Silicon Valley who are scoring it big under some new start-up.  <br>
Enjoy it while you can suckers!<br>
<p>
'Sounds to me like your jealous!'<br>
<p>
'Not at all.  I happen to be one of those cyber-geeks!  But unlike <br>
many of my fellow colleagues, I have a conscience and a heart.  I care <br>
about the 80% or humanity I am obsoleting with each line of code I write.  I <br>
have perused the extro list for over 2 years now, and I have yet to <br>
hear any reasonable talk about compassion or building livingry for the <br>
majority o humanity that is becoming increasingly unnecessary in the <br>
free-market.  If you don't care extropians, I hope you can bury your conscience <br>
as you watch the rest of humanity languish to death while you ride your <br>
extropic vehicles to the stars.<br>
<p>
In closing I would like to say that when people are no longer needed <br>
for a free-market economy, then a free-market economy is no longer needed <br>
by the people.  So the question then becomes, whats beyond the <br>
free-market?  Any ideas?<br>
<p>
I can't think of any with out getting bogged down into some silly <br>
left-winged drivel.  Peronally, I hope we get to the singularity soon, <br>
otherwise we may all drown in our own free-market success.  Except of course <br>
for you savvy extropians!<br>
<p>

Holly Pearson<br>
<p>
P.S.  So, are you an extro-nazi or an extro-saint?<br>
