        What I have noticed with many "rights groups" is that they don't<br>
have a set reason for their actions.  Why does sexual orientation have to<br>
be a major situation in the workplace or society?  I believe that one of<br>
the main purposes of such organizations is to attract attention to a<br>
certain group in hopes of promoting equality; however, this does not so<br>
much promote equality as promote a separation.  When people hear of "gay<br>
marches" [by the way, I'm using homosexuality as an example...the same is<br>
true of any rights group] they automatically see gays as a particular --a<br>
group that is set apart from the rest of society.<br>
<p>
        In an ideal world, each individual would be treated *as*<br>
individuals regardless of their race, culture, creed, sexual orientation,<br>
physical handicap etc.  In an ideal world one *person* would make his own<br>
judgments on another *person* based upon the ideas and personality that<br>
other person possessed.  We haven't come close to achieving this ideal<br>
world yet.  People are still consumed by hatred for other groups...not<br>
considering the individuality of each member.  I think that the only way to<br>
confront this is for each individual to not attract attention to their<br>
sexual orientation, race, creed etc.  By suggesting this, I do not mean<br>
that each person should try to ignore or hide his\her sexual orientation<br>
etc., but accept it for him\herself and not make a big deal out of it.  One<br>
should not try to attract attention *because* of his\her sexual orientation<br>
etc., but set goals and achieve them...proving that being "gay" is not a<br>
hindrance or something to be ashamed of, but something to accept and<br>
incorporate into one's daily life.  When a group sections itself off from<br>
society, it creates an animosity because most other people will want to be<br>
sectioned of as well. The general thought will usually be: "Why are *they*<br>
wanting special rights for their gayness when I can't get special rights<br>
for my &lt;whatever&gt;?"  I have more thoughts on this matter, but I'd like to<br>
hear what people think of this first.<br>
