In a message dated 97-09-20 10:18:59 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Thanks for all your replies,</i><br>
<p>
My pleasure.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  Why don't people kill each others? Because there is a law against it,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  make murder legal and you will see people killing each others.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Why has civilization lasted? IMHO, because there are laws, there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  judicial system to prevent anarchy, in anarchy everyone would do what</i><br>
<i>&gt;  they want and that would surely mean the destruction of mankind.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Civilization doesn't exist because we are good but because institutions</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and persons work very hard at controlling the masses.</i><br>
<p>
Have you ever thought about doing stand up comedy?<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  What if some corporation doesn't make enough mistakes to fall, it will</i><br>
<i>&gt;  eventualy take control of the market and then we will all suffer. In a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  free-market, there will be the ones who are better than other at their</i><br>
<i>&gt;  business, what if this persons are a lot better? They'll control</i><br>
<i>&gt;  everything in their area.</i><br>
<p>
How would a company be able to create a monopoly in a free market?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  DuPont, one, if not the, largest producer of CFCs had knowledge of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  destructive effects of CFCs on the ozone but prevented this from being</i><br>
<i>&gt;  known. There are several sources claiming this. Obviously, if they knew,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  others would too, they just weren't paid attention. Only when persons</i><br>
<i>&gt;  started to die did the governments do something.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  It remaind's me of the mad cow disease, with the information available</i><br>
<i>&gt;  in the 80s it should had been taken measures to prevent people from</i><br>
<i>&gt;  eating cows and yet it continued because economical pressures were more</i><br>
<i>&gt;  important than the thousands that might (we don't know for sure) die</i><br>
<i>&gt;  from the human form of the disease.</i><br>
<p>
Who stopped various organisations who knew of these problems from taking<br>
action?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;  Then why shouldn't we build condition so that all can prosper and not</i><br>
<i>&gt;  just a few. It's not a communist ideology, it's a matter of assuring</i><br>
<i>&gt;  basic conditions to everyone, from that to be wealthy is up to them but</i><br>
<i>&gt;  let's at least assure some basic conditions.</i><br>
<p>
Do believe you should be forced to give your money to others?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If a corporation reaches monopoly in a no-rules world, it won't lose</i><br>
<i>&gt;  easily and we will all suffer. A corporation with a monopoly status will</i><br>
<i>&gt;  have the better research facilities, the better marketing experts, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  will even have the best criminals to take care of their opposition! It</i><br>
<i>&gt;  will become unstopable.</i><br>
<p>
If a corporation is offering you the best goods at the best prices, why are<br>
you suffering?  If it is not, what's to stop another company offering better<br>
goods or lower prices?<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  One last thing, extropy is the opposite of entropy. Our goal is to fight</i><br>
<i>&gt;  entropy or disorder and yet you defend complete disorder in the economy.</i><br>
<p>
No.  extropy and non-entropy are different things.<br>
