In a message dated 97-07-23 11:15:38 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; At the times in question the Sahara was a temperate climate, possibly<br>
 much like the American Midwest. My major objection is that dung beetles<br>
 rule Africa, and all piles likely to grow mushrooms will not remain<br>
 intact long enough to do so. An elephant dump turns into a sheet about 2<br>
 inches thick within 48 hours, and vanishes in about a week. Shroom<br>
 mycelium incubation to fruiting takes 2 weeks minimum.<br>

Thats interesting, the only thing that can be said is maybe dung beetles<br>
werent around 100,000 years ago.  The theory is that mushrooms grew in<br>
shorter and shorter supply until there was none left, maybe this is due to<br>
the dung beetle.<br>
