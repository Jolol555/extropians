Oh, absolutely.  The carrying capacity of land goes up dramatically when<br>
cultivated.  I think a factor of 10 is the rough rule.<br>
<p>
But I do stick by my assertion that on a per capita basis, hunter-gatherer<br>
societies have at least as much free time as agricultural societies.  I've<br>
seen several studies, and although the steriotype is that they have to spend<br>
most of their time foraging, current hunter-gatherers don't.  In many ways<br>
their society resembles that of the information revolution - knowledge is<br>
more important than sheer work, and child labor is consequently of little<br>
value.  Hunter-gatherers have fewer children than agriculturalists, even<br>
though their diet and health seem better than any pre-industrial<br>
agriculturalist.<br>
