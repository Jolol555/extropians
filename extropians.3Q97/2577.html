<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Interrogative?  Expand, please.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would like to get some expert in on this, since my medical knowledge is</i><br>
<i>&gt; more neuroscientific than immunological (I'm not an immunologist, I just</i><br>
<i>&gt; pretend on the net :-). Basically, the immune system is programmed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; destroy, destroy, destroy - everything. But during the complex process</i><br>
<i>&gt; where white blood cells are bred the cells that would kill unsuitable</i><br>
<i>&gt; things (like each other, the body etc) are weeded out, as are the "meek"</i><br>
<i>&gt; cells. The rest are just barely tamed, and will with no hesitation destroy</i><br>
<i>&gt; any cell that doesn't show the right antigens, and everything in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; vicinity.</i><br>
<p>
Okay, so our immune system uses directed evolution to create attack nanites. <br>
Just because the attack nanites are unsophisticated does not mean the immune<br>
system is unsophisticated.  There's strategy, tactics, and dynamic evolution<br>
of new attack nanites.  The actual battles may be between idiots, but the<br>
supporting operations and design of the idiots is where victory will be<br>
decided, and where relative complexity is calculated.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Good guys will be motivated to contemplate directed evolution since the bad guys</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; do it; and they tend to have more brainpower and money on their side. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; think the weapon of openness is important here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It could go either way.  Maybe the bad guys kidnap all the scientists and then</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; use pain-center stimulation to achieve faster results.  Idealism may win</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; battles and break ties, but it is not a defense to be trusted.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Or maybe the good guys spread a nanite which give all bad guys migraine</i><br>
<i>&gt; when they think evil thoughts. Get real, this sort of unrealistic Hollywood</i><br>
<i>&gt; speculations is the last thing we need ("... if you do that, I'll send in</i><br>
<i>&gt; my *dragons*!" "Ha! I have an army of invisible pink unicorns that will</i><br>
<i>&gt; eat your dragons!").</i><br>
<p>
That was my point, although it was directed more at the dangers of idealistic<br>
optimism than at fantasy complexification.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I never said I would sketch an</i><br>
<i>&gt; *invulnerable* system, just a sufficiently strong system. For any immense</i><br>
<i>&gt; shielding I can come up with you could always invoke an even greater</i><br>
<i>&gt; cosmological disaster ("But your immune system can't stand a supernova!").</i><br>
<i>&gt; This exercise is trying to look at defenses against gray goo, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; is the real problem, not macro-level warfare.</i><br>
<p>
But you *do* need an invulnerable system, or at least one that is invulnerable<br>
to goo.  I can reasonably invoke any forces modern technology is capable of<br>
wielding, up to and including nuclear weapons.  If black goo reduces your city<br>
to radioactive ash, you lose!  It doesn't matter how sophisticated your<br>
defenses are!  I am darn well entitled to demand that your immune system stand<br>
up against nuclear weapons, because in practice, that's what going to be used!<br>
<p>
Not impossible.  Not at all impossible.  If you have a layered defense system,<br>
a diamond shell, and Fog seat belts, the city might be perfectly capable of<br>
withstanding a nuclear attack.  It would lose a layer of defense, but might<br>
well be capable of rebuilding it before more black goo crossed the radioactive<br>
zone.  In addition, as I pointed out, the city might gain more than it lost.<br>
<p>
Even so, it's entirely possible that, on any planet, the black goo wins.  All<br>
the time.  Every time.  The Universe is under no obligation to make things<br>
easy for us.  Hence the proposed Directive of Evacuation:  "Get everyone off<br>
the Earth, into partitioned space colonies, before releasing nanotechnology to<br>
the world."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Your claim that destruction is</i><br>
<i>&gt; fundamentally more efficient than creation suggests that if I know about</i><br>
<i>&gt; your goo I can destroy it.</i><br>
<p>
There is, of course, something to that.  The problem is preventing it from<br>
being mutual destruction.  The surface area of conflict, and strategic<br>
compartmentalization, mean that if destruction is easier than creation, then<br>
attack is easier than defense, and both parties lose equal amounts of<br>
resources until only one is left.  Don't forget that your resources may be<br>
devoted to supporting humans.  Also, nanobattle might end in stalemate, but<br>
even so eliminate all higher-than-nano structures such as humans.<br>
<p>
My mental picture of these conflicts is partially drawn from Conway's Game of<br>
Life, in which a single particle can destroy an enormous, complex structure. <br>
Things on the molecular level will almost certainly be different.  Even so, I<br>
know of no better image.<br>
<p>
Though molecules are FAR more robust than any Life structure I have ever been<br>
privileged to look at, the actual "front" might still resemble a game of Life.<br>
 Energy pulses through and breaks all bonds, creating a no-man's-land<br>
reminiscent of randomized Life.  Both sides grab at the atoms and volume<br>
created.  Tactically, the situation appears symmetrical.  Strategically, it's<br>
hard to tell who has the advantage.<br>
<p>
Still, let's dwell on the tactics for a few moments.  The goo can send a<br>
shaped explosion aimed at the city, so that the no-man's-land is composed of<br>
formerly city material, rather than equal amounts of city and goo.  Can the<br>
city send shaped charges back at the goo?  Yes.  Can the city "grab" the<br>
no-man's-land thus created?  Locally, yes - although there is one *minor*<br>
tactical advantage, which is that the goo is independent and the city is<br>
structured, so that the city has to expend more effort to build into a given<br>
amount of volume.  But I'm claiming a lot of battle intelligence for the black<br>
goo, while the city's first line of defense, rather than being diamondoid, may<br>
be independent 'munes.  I think that, tactically, there's a match.<br>
<p>
Strategically, I'm assuming the goo has unlimited material, while the city has<br>
limited material.  I'm assuming that nuclear power is cheap enough that both<br>
have unlimited power.  (I'm also assuming the city is padded, so nukes can't<br>
kill it outright.)  Also, the goo surrounds the city.<br>
<p>
Try this tactic.  First, the goo hits the city with a vaporize-one-layer<br>
attack, even though this also vaporizes a layer of goo.  Then it detonates a<br>
nuclear weapon next to the city.  This pushes the city into the goo,<br>
dissipating the no-man's-land and replacing it with the soft goo.  The goo is<br>
using, as a strategic/tactical advantage, the city's rigidity.  If the city is<br>
surrounded by a layer of soft goo, it's difficult to tell what happens.<br>
<p>
The city is a steel ball surrounded by 'munes surrounded by goo.  A nuke stirs<br>
things up.  Since goo outnumbers 'mune, most of the city is now surrounded by<br>
goo.  The 'mune stirred into the goo can be treated as isolated spores and<br>
obliterated with overwhelming force.  The city has lost some mass.  Moreover,<br>
this is a one-way tactic; it cannot be used against the goo.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  How much of an insulator is [diamond] for temperature?  What about gamma rays?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It conducts heat well, and as far as I know is transparent for gamma rays.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But you are not seriously suggesting grey goo radiating gamma rays?</i><br>
<i>&gt; (that would BTW be very bad for the goo too, since nanites are radiation</i><br>
<i>&gt; sensitive; and I could have radiation shielding in the skin while the</i><br>
<i>&gt; goo would be unprotected (since grey goo carrying around lead is easy</i><br>
<i>&gt; to find and exterminate by taking it away)).</i><br>
<p>
Sigh.  Gray goo, yes, a sea of black goo, no.  I am not proposing that goo<br>
spores will radiate gamma rays.  War goo might.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Diamond does quite nicely here, although even more inert materials would</i><br>
<i>&gt; do better. The breaches can be of two kinds, a strong</i><br>
<i>&gt; external force making its way in, and in that case we are talking about</i><br>
<i>&gt; macro level defense and offense again, or nanites forcing their way through</i><br>
<i>&gt; the walls. In the later case, they would need energy to breach the</i><br>
<i>&gt; walls if they are inert, and it would be exothermic for the defenders to</i><br>
<i>&gt; thicken their walls. If they turned the surrounding compartments into</i><br>
<i>&gt; a "diamondoid scar" the energy in the infected compartment would not</i><br>
<i>&gt; be enough to breach the barrier, and the whole infection would require</i><br>
<i>&gt; a lot of external support (which could be broken).</i><br>
<p>
I am mainly worried about macro attack and defense.  If it is easier to<br>
destroy than create, this translates into a strategic advantage for the human<br>
in spore attacks.  You just find and destroy the spore, using nuclear weapons<br>
if you feel like it.<br>
<p>
I'd be more inclined to trap the spore in something solid, heat it to a few<br>
thousand degrees, pass a few thousand amperes, and hurl into the nuclear<br>
reactor that powers the city.  If you can make something the spore can't get<br>
into, you can make something it can't get out of, and will be greatly aided by<br>
the fact that you don't give a damn about living conditions inside the trap. <br>
Diamond scar?  Diamond cyst!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; What detector mechanism are you using?  Can I falsely trigger it over the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; entire body, thus making the "detector" useless and redundant?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have been thinking of having nanometer "pipes" criss-crossing the barrier,</i><br>
<i>&gt; containing linear molecules which break or vibrate when interfered with. You</i><br>
<i>&gt; cannot detect them from the outside (just diamond, and then an opening -</i><br>
<i>&gt; oops!), and the signal into the compartment will give information about</i><br>
<i>&gt; where something is going on.</i><br>
<p>
Okay, sounds to me like they're perfectly vulnerable to spoofing.  And<br>
regardless of whether I can "detect" them from the outside, why shouldn't I<br>
simply assume they're there?  Can they be fooled if I know they're there<br>
(although not exactly where)?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  If sealed-off</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; areas are easier to attack, wouldn't the false alarm let me peel off an entire</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; layer?  And why couldn't I just repeat the action until you were the size of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; an apple core?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sounds like something that could be designed away. OK, I haven't yet</i><br>
<i>&gt; tried to sketch how the control systems ought to look (I haven't got the</i><br>
<i>&gt; time even for doing this discussion properly! :-( ). The software</i><br>
<i>&gt; part is of course even more important than the hardware part.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But basically, if you trigger all the surface cells, don't you think the</i><br>
<i>&gt; system will immediately (assuming some intelligence somewhere) guess</i><br>
<i>&gt; the strategy?</i><br>
<p>
Of course.  But even so, the detectors are useless.  You offered an advantage;<br>
that advantage has been negated.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; The rest of the organism (could be a transhuman, factory</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; or a city) is compartmentalized with similar walls; infected sections</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; can be isolated.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Okay, so you've made the problem of immunity recursive on immunity for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; single section.  This may actually be an excellent plan of defense, allowing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for partial breaches and reserves.  But a design for an immune system it's not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is a partial solution, and makes the problem more manageable. The body</i><br>
<i>&gt; uses something fairly similar with its internal barriers (it is surprising</i><br>
<i>&gt; how strong the blood-brain barrier is, even adrenaline can't get through!).</i><br>
<p>
I don't deny it's an effective partial solution.  Like the principle of proof<br>
by induction, it's a very useful solution.  But you still need to write the<br>
recursive function, not just decide to use LISP as a language.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Okay, I see a trend developing in your plan.  Detection is the important</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thing; it's assumed that pockets of infection, once detected, can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; obliterated.  Very much like the human immune system.  But if viruses could</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; outfight white blood cells, we'd be dead.  I'll conceed that fooling detection</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; might be made difficult, almost impossible, through the use of digital</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; signatures.  But again - how do you keep a single cell from being penetrated?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Once a cell is penetrated, you destroy it - but does the destruction keep the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; infection from spreading?  A single spore might be defeated by this strategy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A sea of gray goo won't be.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A sea of gray goo is also a macro-level problem. It is obvious, it can</i><br>
<i>&gt; be fought on the macro level (meaning that human or transhuman intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt; have the time and space to implement defenses not just based on what their</i><br>
<i>&gt; ordinary immune systems can do, but also their other available resources).</i><br>
<i>&gt; For example, it wouldn't appear impossible to nanofacture "antibodies",</i><br>
<i>&gt; very simple nanites which disrupt the goo nanites, en masse once the goo</i><br>
<i>&gt; is understood.</i><br>
<p>
Which is more complex, more subject to disruption?  You, or the goo?  I won't<br>
discuss transhuman defense against the goo; that's their problem.  But human<br>
intelligence might NOT have the time to implement defenses in nanowar.  Not if<br>
things move too quickly; not if evolution controls the battlefield.  Anyway, I<br>
think that nanowar is the problem.  If nanowar is easy enough, destructive<br>
enough, the Evacuation becomes necessary.<br>
<p>
The gray goo problem is overrated; it's black goo we need to worry about.  We<br>
can get along just fine without any self-reproducing nanites, ever.  We can<br>
make 10 capable of constructing 1, given plans broadcasted by remote signal. <br>
If we can't use remote signals, we can use super-redundant "queens" to carry<br>
the information that directs 10 to make 1, or 20 to make a queen.  Will this<br>
slow down reproduction?  You bet.  Who cares?  It's not the speed that makes<br>
nano reproduction so powerful, it's that it happens at all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have noticed that your approach seems to be that when subtle attacks</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't work, you invoke maximum overkill instead. But that takes a lot</i><br>
<i>&gt; of resources, and can often be disrupted more easily than a subtle attack</i><br>
<i>&gt; (compare "AAARGH! The goo has my password!" to "Ouch, this goo is corrosive,</i><br>
<i>&gt; let's wash it away in a shower of hydrogen peroxide").</i><br>
<p>
Subtle attacks are operating under enormous strategic disadvantages.  Not that<br>
they won't be possible.  I've noticed and informed authorities of my share of<br>
analogies between computer security programs and toilet tissue.  But we can't<br>
discuss subtle attacks, not really.  Subtle attacks will mature slowly as the<br>
power of nanotech unfolds, as with computer security in our times.  What could<br>
a 1950s programmer say about computer security?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Let's go down to the real battle - dismantling nanites.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  As far as I can tell, your strategy simply lets</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; me destroy your entire complex cell by cell.  Penetrate a cell, watch it go up</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in flame... repeat.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmm, like Stalingrad? ;-) You assume that the destroyed cell will no</i><br>
<i>&gt; longer be a problem. But what if it turned into a cube of inert diamondoid?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Then it would also be a hinder, and give me even more time to develop</i><br>
<i>&gt; countermeasures.</i><br>
<p>
If it is inert diamondoid, is that more of a hindrance than the outer shell?<br>
<p>
Besides, this whole discussion is looking obsolete anyway.  Any rigid outer<br>
defense is toast.  It has to be surrounded by explosive-equipped soft 'mune. <br>
At most, you can have a rigid outer defense as a pretty shell.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I see that I have been a bit too defensive (I usually am in strategy),</i><br>
<i>&gt; since you are right in that just slowing the advance of the goo won't</i><br>
<i>&gt; win the fight. So, to get back to how the body works, I'll better</i><br>
<i>&gt; develop antibodies and macrophages.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An antibody would be a very simple device that sabotages a certain nanite.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It could be a molecule that binds and then tends to stick to other</i><br>
<i>&gt; antibodies, trapping the goo nanites as dimers or polymers. A macrophage is</i><br>
<i>&gt; simply a selective disassebler, which destroys a certain kind of nanite</i><br>
<i>&gt; or structure. Assuming I have detected the infection the next step would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be to make antibodies and macrophages against it, and start spreading them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Note that they would be produced faster than the goo since the goo would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to both reproduce, breach security and defend itself while the</i><br>
<i>&gt; antibodies and macrophages would just be produced (although a goo-like</i><br>
<i>&gt; macrophage is an interesting and dangerous concept) and sent on their way.</i><br>
<p>
It has often struck me that homogeneity is a tremendous tactical advantage in<br>
battle.  Well, not really, only in this past thread.  But even so, homogeneity<br>
means you have no delay time to bring up specialized warriors; you can replace<br>
all fallen comrades simply by stirring things up.<br>
<p>
But even granting your case, if the goo has so much as a cubic millimeter to<br>
call its own, it can keep its queen reproducers in the center while<br>
surrounding itself with warrior goo, just like the city.<br>
<p>
Why can't the goo use antibodies and macrophages against the 'mune?<br>
<p>
The tactical symmetry remains unbroken.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The real obvious one is this.  Your immune system - any immune system</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; conceived along these lines - requires that two nanosystems fight each other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to a standstill.  If two nanosystems fight and destroy each other, then any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; city in an island of gray goo is doomed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think you are thinking too much of ants fighting here. I see it more</i><br>
<i>&gt; as chemistry, especially protein interactions. It is much easier to make</i><br>
<i>&gt; something which binds goo into an inert mass than to build a goo eater.</i><br>
<p>
Aha!  A tactical advantage for defense over offense!  It is easier to keep a<br>
mass inert than it is to keep it active!  ... Still, one has to wonder about explosives.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  The goo simply makes repeated</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; attacks, and each time, the city shrinks a little.  We won't even speak of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; such horrors as cutting off that city's solar power.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An isolated immune system in a world where nobody else has immune systems</i><br>
<i>&gt; is weaker than a system in a world where nanodefenses are common. The ultimate</i><br>
<i>&gt; defense would of course be to have immune systems everywhere, defending</i><br>
<i>&gt; not just the transhumans but the himalayas, squirrels and grass. A bit like</i><br>
<i>&gt; the current state in biology, really.</i><br>
<p>
If nanotechnology was released on Earth, the 'munes would have to be<br>
EVERYWHERE.  The air.  The water.  Earth's molten core.  Otherwise, the goo<br>
could gain a foothold.  At all costs, the goo can *never* be allowed to become<br>
a sea.  While it is spores it can be obliterated in mutual annihilation.  As a<br>
sea, it obliterates you.  It's not quite a molecular game of Go.  You have to<br>
outnumber and outdeepen your enemy, not just surround it.  But even so...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; In short, the immune system requires that *defense* have an advantage over</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; *offense*.  I can conceive of any number of ways that this could happen.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; shall now proceed to list them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, this is the crux. I contend that defense is easier.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [Some good examples deleted for brevity; I get the impression we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussing nano-sized knights fighting on the battlements of a transhuman</i><br>
<i>&gt; city :-)]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
[Examples of exotic tech deleted by author.]<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; OK, but at this level I simply escape into my own basement universe (Mitch</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggested that you could even hide backdoor wormholes inside atoms for</i><br>
<i>&gt; unexpected ambushes). Dragons vs. invisible pink unicorns again?</i><br>
<p>
I agree, and pretty much said so.  But the ideas might have sparked something.<br>
 Couldn't hurt to put it down.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Then there's the simple possibility, dependent on molecular details of which I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; know nothing, that defense on the molecular level has an innate advantage over</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; offense.  Certain molecules or nano-screens might simply be easier to form</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; than to break, just like atoms or quarks.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Good point. There are certainly some molecules which are much easier to</i><br>
<i>&gt; break than to form, and hence allows me to make good detection systems or</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanites whose programming is erased if they are opened. I think there might</i><br>
<i>&gt; be some structures which are very troublesome to destroy on the nano level.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, but the problem with rigid structures is that they can be destroyed by<br>
explosives.  There are no invulnerable shells.  A blast creates a free area<br>
which both sides try to gobble.  Sit there in your shell and you're dead meat;<br>
the goo will send a shaped charge to create an asymmetrical dead zone, eat the<br>
whole thing, and repeat until you're the size of an apple core.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Nanosystems are always faced with "destruction by induction".  That is, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; can always destroy one cell; therefore you can destroy the whole thing.  To</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; defend against this, it is required that the system expand faster than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; destruction OR that it be impossible to destroy one cell.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Or that you can make the loss of a finite number of cells bearable. If their</i><br>
<i>&gt; loss removes the threat (for example by forming a nanoscar), then the</i><br>
<i>&gt; defense side will win.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree with the whole concept of a nanoscar.  If there is such a thing,<br>
you turn it into your first line of defense, not wait until after you've been invaded.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Ergo, it is easier to destroy than create.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Om mani padme hum... :-)</i><br>
<p>
You aren't serious, but even so... after all that?  The whole discussion?  I'm<br>
debating it, not asserting it, although considering the existence of TNT and<br>
nukes, destruction is close to axiomatic on the molecular level.<br>

A nice piece by Moravec.  One of those Little Bits of Everything.  Superdense<br>
computers (hence Higgsium and Monopolium), uploading identity, and an odd<br>
theory about quantum mechanics.  The book is by Baen Books, ISBN 9-671-65385-7.<br>
