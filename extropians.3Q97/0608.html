In a message dated 97-07-17 09:02:45 EDT, <br>
<p>
she said:<br>
&lt;&lt; <br>
<i> &gt; ...given the severity and irreversibility of the [sex change] operation</i><br>
<i> &gt; we are discussing, and the fact that many people asking for it have other</i><br>
<i> &gt; psychological problems, it doesn't seem inappropriate for the medical</i><br>
<i> &gt; profession to act as 'gatekeepers'... [to ensure that this]</i><br>
<i> &gt; particular, major, and undeniably medical, decision is not taken</i><br>
<i> &gt; mistakenly: and who better than the medical profession to do that? The</i><br>
<i> &gt; answer may come back, 'The individual concerned', but many such people are</i><br>
<i> &gt; not be in a suitable mental state to take such a decision: why should the</i><br>
<i> &gt; medical profession throw out its duty of patient care in these cases?</i><br>
 <br>
Then he said:<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;If a person is mentally competent to engage in ordinary contracts, can</i><br>
 hold a job, make decisions such concerning sexual relations, other<br>
 medical procedures, and other important aspects of life, then any law<br>
 or professional "standard" that interferes with that individual's<br>
 decision is repugnant to individual sovereignty.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
He said it better than I couldl...I was thinking that it was odd for such an<br>
opinion to emanate from a Libertarian group such as the Extropian Mailing<br>
List.  I can imagine what the Anarchists among us must be thinking.<br>
<p>
I figure we can't have it both ways...either a socialist "Father knows best"<br>
or ......."Because  I'm the Mommy!!!" type of society....which will<br>
eventually collapse upon itself absent war (in which case it will most likely<br>
be conqured since decesion making is so difficult)....or an uneasy collection<br>
of individuals who profit when they guess right....and suffer when they guess<br>
wrong.<br>
<p>
So my feelings are that if someone wants to do something horrible to<br>
himself....such as smoke...eat saturated fats....listen to country<br>
music....watch tv...or engage in some novel surgical procedure...then who is<br>
to tell him no?  Of course if he doesn't like the results  brought about by<br>
 such actions....oh well....<br>
<p>
He can serve as an example to others as to why such a course of action should<br>
not be taken.<br>
