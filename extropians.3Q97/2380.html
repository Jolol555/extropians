     I had mentioned:<br>
       <br>
     I much prefer our research dollars going towards restoring and <br>
     improving earth conditions and listening for "come back" signals from <br>
     out there.<br>
     <br>
     Davin responded:<br>
      <br>
     I surprised to hear such a comment coming from the Extropian mailing <br>
     list.  Why would we need to sink more research on Earth, where we <br>
     already have billions sunk--for all of human history?  <br>
     <br>
     I respond:<br>
     <br>
     For one, you're assuming the author (or for that matter, any <br>
     contributor) to be "Orthodox" Extropian.  For two, I am not AGAINST <br>
     missions to other planets to discover more about them but I am against <br>
     our environmental situation worsening here and putting pressure on the <br>
     potential of an earlier-arriving singularity type instance.  We can <br>
     "enjoy the scenery" more if we're not "fighting the rapids".  <br>
     (Granted, adreniline does have its motivating properties) &lt;G&gt;.<br>
     <br>
