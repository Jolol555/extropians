I know why I don't believe emotions are the easy part.<br>
<p>
To me, "emotions" are all the energy-allocation and value-calculating<br>
heuristics and signals, in particular those that direct thought and<br>
color (or colorize) memory.<br>
<p>
In this light, "raw intelligence" would be all the brute-force algorithms<br>
with no knowlege of efficiency, importance, other representations, context,<br>
learning, etc.  Emotion is all the heuristics, meta-heuristics, and so on.<br>
<p>
So, emotion is everything but the easiest part.  Everything except<br>
carrying out what you've already learned how to do by rote.  Anytime<br>
there are previously-unreconciled goals or aspects of a situation that<br>
come up simultaneously, the process that recognizes that and finds ways<br>
to balance or resolve it is emotion.  It does this by having *somewhat*<br>
more general knowledge of kinds of conflict--but there are many<br>
kinds of inner conflicts and many skills for dealing with them.  And<br>
there are conflicts between the conflict-resolution strategies which<br>
require resolution, and so on.<br>
<p>
Was it Anders who said emotion's easy?  He seems to mean pre-wired<br>
pleasure and pain.  If that's all it means, then one-celled creatures<br>
have "emotions," and we'll only have to design something as complex<br>
as an E. Coli to have "emotion."  Lewis Thomas proposed modestly that<br>
we not start any nuclear wars until we understand one single-celled<br>
animal completely.<br>
<p>
Or, are we talking about emotions as complex as a worm has?  A lizard?<br>
How many billions of years of evolution of "easy part" are we trying<br>
to duplicate?<br>
