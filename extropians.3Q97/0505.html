Anders Sandberg:<br>
<i>&gt;random accumulation of experience and a gradual abstraction from</i><br>
<i>&gt;them. Schooling is one method intended to make this process a bit</i><br>
<i>&gt;more efficient, maybe some initiation rites could be considered</i><br>
<i>&gt;growth tools too. Are there others reliable methods?</i><br>
<p>
Once one reaches a certain level of maturity and education, that <br>
person would not necessarily have to rely on predesigned learning <br>
processes.  One can design one's own life experiences in order to <br>
create environments and events that will stimulate growth and break <br>
through personal barriers--sometimes with the guidance of another <br>
person or organization, sometimes entirely alone.  <br>
<p>
Many universities are now taking this approach, teaching the basic skills <br>
of learning design and self-evalutation in order to promote lifelong <br>
education that continues beyond the acquisition of a degree.  I think <br>
that someday we won't even need universities anymore, as learning <br>
itself becomes more closely integrated into daily life.<br>
