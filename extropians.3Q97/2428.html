<p>
I think so.<br>
<p>

<p>
I have to admit I haven't found anything to improve those either.  Then<br>
again, I haven't been looking.  I may bring them up with my doctor the<br>
next time I see him.<br>

<p>
Let's not paint all "neuro drugs" with the same brush.  If you're depressed,<br>
one antidepressant may help and another may not; yet another may both help<br>
and have less worrisome side effects.  It depends on your particular brain<br>
chemistry.  I definitely prefer having my doctor (a specialist in "mind<br>
medicine" -- my term) involved; I certainly don't believe what I read on<br>
labels.  Medline searches may help.<br>
