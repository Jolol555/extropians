<i>&gt; &gt; So today's poor are richer than yesterday's poor.  That's the point.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That is still quite contradictory. The proper way to view this may be stated</i><br>
<i>&gt; as:   the standard of living has been raised. No one can convince me that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "poor" ( which in common semantics means a life without proper shelter,</i><br>
<i>&gt; medical care and adequate food) give a damn if we chose to think...</i><br>
<p>
I never said that /they/ give a damn.  Self-perception is not reality.<br>
What's "proper"?  "adequate"?  Why is a recent invention like medical<br>
care considered a necessity rather than a nifty new product that lots<br>
of people like?  Name a single person in the US who does not have more<br>
than suficient food available to him at no cost.  If you keep redefining<br>
"poor" whenever everyone's life gets better, then there will always be<br>
poor by definition--and 100 years from now poor people will have to<br>
live in old unsafe wooden houses and drive along the ground in antique<br>
cars and will have to have cheap plastic glasses instead of corneal<br>
implants, and have to suffer all kinds of indignities by the standards<br>
of that day.  And they will live like the kings of today, just as<br>
today's poor have benefits today that the rich of 1897 didn't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [to deny their] experience of starving to death is denial of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; worst sort, and IMO downright mean. </i><br>
<p>
No one is denying suffering.  What we are denying is what some<br>
claim (without evidence) to be its cause.  Motives don't count;<br>
results count.  No rational man gives a damn how much anyone<br>
cares; what matters is what can be accomplished; how can real<br>
problems be solved and real people helped--in real, measurable<br>
terms, not only in their self-perceived delusions.  The obvious,<br>
measurable, demonstrated fact so clear to most of us here that<br>
we rarely bother to argue it, is that the free market throughout<br>
history has helped more people, solved more problems, and made<br>
more of a difference in people's lives than any feel-good<br>
rhetoric or popular politician ever has.  Capitalism feeds people;<br>
socialism kiils them.  That's the plain facts, and it is those<br>
who deny /that/ who will be the cause of the next generations<br>
suffering, no matter how loudly they proclaim their empathy.<br>
Fuck empathy.  If you want to help humanity, get a job.<br>
