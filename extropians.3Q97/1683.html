Enter: exowomb. This device will probably hit the streets within 20 years<br>
or<br>
so, maybe sooner. It will eventually mean the virtual end of pregnancy (in<br>
the<br>
western societies anyway), women will have a roll similar to that of the<br>
man:<br>
casual cell donation. This is in itself a pretty neutral fact, it can<br>
pretty much work both ways (emancipation or erosion of status). Male<br>
agression <br>
(behaviour that's necessary to stand up for yourself, voice an opinion,<br>
make yourself heard, for example on this list. Women are just too modest,<br>
and<br>
men too arrogant) will remain the decisive factor and patriarchies will<br>
remain<br>
the standard, unless...some good research is done to determine exactly what<br>
causes male and female behaviour, and the results are used to modify (for<br>
ex.<br>
with hormone treatment) the embryo/foetus in the exowomb so that males<br>
become less agressive and females more agressive to create an equilibrium.<br>
Voila, equality to go!<br>
