There may not be an immunologist in the house, but I've been reading a<br>
recent textbook for the past few days.  Unless a strong chemist can<br>
assure me that fine particles of diamond or buckystuff can resist<br>
hydrogren peroxide, free radicals, and other oxidizing goodies (possibly<br>
including hydroxyls, I forget) I think our white blood cells are quite<br>
capable of destroying an ingested nanite.<br>
<p>
However, I'm not sure the immune system would know to go after the<br>
nanites.  It's basically a question of whether the nanites would trigger<br>
an immune response.  Our systems are most sensitive to foreign proteins,<br>
preferably large or with special aromatic amino acids.  Synthetic<br>
homopolymers -- only one building block -- tend not to trigger<br>
responses.  Killer cells are activated by peptide fragments displayed on<br>
the membranes of cells containing them.  (Dextrorotary amino acid<br>
proteins tend not to trigger an immune response, because our enzymes<br>
only break down levorotatory amino acids.)  On the other hand, "large,<br>
insoluble macromolecules are good immunogens" so I don't know how pure<br>
carbon nanites would be responded to.  Presumably someone could get some<br>
idea by injecting small carbon particles into a lab mouse and seeing<br>
what happened.<br>
<p>
As I said, carbon-nanites are probably an overrated threat, due to the<br>
flammability problem.  I'll give you some more threatening ideas:<br>
<p>
(1) bacteria based on right-handed proteins and sugars, but equipped<br>
with tools for dealing with both orientations themselves.  No natural<br>
life would be able to digest them (usefully; they'd probably die in<br>
stomach acid) but they could go through the biosphere.  I have no idea<br>
of what's involved in reversing the handedness of an amino acid --<br>
possibly breaking it down and rebuilding it from scratch.  That would<br>
probably put a kink in their style, but they could still be annoying.<br>
<p>
(2) Rock-nanites, based on AlO, SiO, or relatied mateirals (quartzoid,<br>
sapphireoid.)  Their elements are as abundant as carbon, and they're<br>
already burnt, so the flamethrower attack won't work.  They'll probably<br>
still be low in entropy, and they'd have to be disassembling biomass for<br>
the hell of it, not because they were using it to grow themselves<br>
(except as an energy source, perhaps.)<br>
<p>
Of course, I don't think anyone's really working on sapphire nanites.<br>
People who worry about this should hope that Carl's progression is<br>
wrong, and that we do start with bucky/diamond nanites.  Rampaging<br>
mistakes at that level will be easy to control.  Then by the time more<br>
resistant nanites start wandering around strong nano-defenses would<br>
already be in place.<br>
<p>
Merry part,<br>
