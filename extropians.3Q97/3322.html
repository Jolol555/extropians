<p>
The interesting thing about syndicates is that the defectors inside<br>
them do cooperate to a large extent (defections tends to be messy).<br>
So the end result of this may be a population divided into blocks<br>
which cooperate internally and more often defects against each other. <br>

<i>&gt; Order does not seem</i><br>

<p>
True. This is the major reason I don't think market solutions<br>
always produce the best results as perceived by human individuals;<br>
markets can organise to produce good results for other entities<br>
than humans, such as corporations. <br>
<p>
I'm reading Kauffman's "Investigations", and his ideas might be<br>
applicable here. First, the what the community *is* will be changed<br>
by the actions of the participating individuals. And spontaneous<br>
order seems to move it towards a self-organized critical state, where<br>
avalanches of change occur at varying frequencies. The interesting<br>
possibility is that Kauffman claims the mean fitness tends to be<br>
maximal in this "border of chaos" state, and that this may be an<br>
universal property.<br>
