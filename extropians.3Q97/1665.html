They are not physical particles. However, the strings which state the<br>
Postulates are finite and representatable within the physical universe.<br>
The longest Preal string has as many characters as there are particles<br>
in the universe, approximately.<br>

<p>
Mreal is a subset of Preal. A rather small subset - I suspect the<br>
information capacity of a human brain is about 10^20 bits, and a 1.5 Kg<br>
brain contains about  10^30 particles.<br>

Stating that the Mandelbrot Set is Real doesn't tell me very much, so it<br>
has few consequences. <br>
<p>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;If one adheres to the notion that a wave function is strictly a</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;means of calculating probabilities of events, this confusion</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;vanishes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If so and it's meaningless to ask what slit the electron went through, and it</i><br>
<i>&gt; all just comes down to what I can calculate, then what does that say about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the idea that there are things in the world independent of me, and what does</i><br>
<i>&gt; that say about your 3 different types of "reality"?</i><br>
<p>
What I can actually calculate is very much the crux of the matter. I am<br>
limited to what I can do with Preal particles, and my thinking is<br>
limited to what can be expressed within the Mreal. It is the mystics who<br>
are totally immured of the inner infinite Reality, I am looking at what<br>
can be expressed physically as a profound limit to what we can express.<br>
Of course the use of abstraction is very useful here, for example the<br>
word 'googol' describes a Real number but not a Preal one. However the<br>
string 'googol' provides a tag for defining a specific Real number - but<br>
the vast, vast majority of numbers of similar magnitude will never be<br>
discussed or explored - it's not possible to do so.<br>
