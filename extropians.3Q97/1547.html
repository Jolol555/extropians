         What?  It never occured to you that rich and powerful<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; No. Let's make a BOTE mathematical model for memetic spread in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; very</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; large population (assumed infinite in this case). Let x(t) be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; number of people infected with the meme at time t. They infect</i><br>
<i>&gt; other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; people at a constant rate k.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     Assumption is wrong....law of diminishing returns sets in...meme</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; spread slows down after a long time if there is no resistance,</i><br>
<i>&gt; quickly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; if the establishment uses its power to squelch it early.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I was ignoring that, since I don't have the time to make a realistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; model right now. But the model can of course easily be extended to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; finite population, with resistance gradually building up. See any</i><br>
<i>&gt; standard epidemologic textbook.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
     Yes, but you are ignoring (again) how early resistance generated by<br>
the Establishment can and will stop a new vigorous meme dead in its<br>
tracks if there is enough at stake.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Notice how the Establishment periodically cracks down on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "conspiracy theory memes"?  Conspiracy memes are quite infectious</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (partly because there is a large element of truth) but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Establishment fights back hard through Foundation supported</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; propaganda every time they start to gain momentum.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Conspiracy theory memes are interesting in themselves (lots of clever</i><br>
<i>&gt; strategies to replicate, including the ability to explain away lack</i><br>
<i>&gt; of evidence, "us vs. them", becoming stronger by being persecuted</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc.). But I think you are infected by a conspiracy theory meme</i><br>
<i>&gt; yourself in this case: what is the evidence that the estabilishment</i><br>
<i>&gt; cracks down on conspiracy theories more often than other memes?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
        The Establishment cracks down on conspiracy memes because<br>
theycan lead to revolution.  Two examples that immediately come to mind:<br>
<p>
1.  The anti-John Birch Society hysteria whipped-up the the<br>
Establishment<br>
in the late 1950's and early 1960's.  This campaign bore its fruit in<br>
the<br>
Goldwater defeat of 1960.....<br>
<p>
2.  The recent media induced witch hunt against conspiracy theorists and<br>
<p>
all anti-Statists following what Clinton admits was the fortuitous OKC<br>
bombing.<br>
Suddenly conspiracy theorists, militia members, and, often all,<br>
libertarians and<br>
other anti-Statists are lumped together as "anti-Governement" and beyond<br>
the pale.<br>
<p>
Really....there is no problem coming-up with evidence, though designing<br>
a controlled<br>
experiment is pretty difficult.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; There is also some agency which spreads</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the meme deliberately, infecting new hosts at a rate l. Assume</i><br>
<i>&gt; that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; infections last for life. Then we get the differential equation:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     This second assumption is even more wrong than the first!  New</i><br>
<i>&gt; memes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have no such staying power....seen many "Kilroys" lately?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I suggest that you read my paper about the lifecycle of memes for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; better discussion of it. My assumption above was of course an</i><br>
<i>&gt; oversimplification, but the model was intended to show my point, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be qualitatively correct.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
     Models can be designed to get the results you want.  They<br>
provenothing unless the constants and relationships can be empirically<br>
verified,<br>
which I am sure you know very well.  Look at the "limits to growth"<br>
non-sense of<br>
Meadows and what's his name!<br>
<p>
     Evidence looks clear to me that the powers that be to remain so,<br>
must<br>
and do control memetic infection when the chips are down.  Of course,<br>
eventually,<br>
all ruling classes and/or sections thereof fail in this mission and fall<br>
into the dustbin<br>
of history.  Just follow the activities of the great Foundations...they<br>
spend most of<br>
their money promoting Statist memes!  Just an irrelevancy I suppose?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; x'(t)= kx(t)+l</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; This has the solution x(t)=c exp(kt) + (l/k). Note that the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; term, corresponding to the exponential spread of the meme</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; person-to-person will overrun the second corresponding to outside</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; insertion quite quickly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     So!  The rationalization against "ruling class/conspiracy"</i><br>
<i>&gt; theory</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fails.  Admit it!  You just want to be in memetic resonance with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; powers that be!  ...the manipulators of the State!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is too bad, I don't have the time to analyse your statements</i><br>
<i>&gt; more in detail to show how your reaction easily could be deduced from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the conspiracy meme you are carrying. Anyway, what I believe doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter, look at the facts instead.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
     Likewise, I am sure!  Tis I that am looking at the facts and<br>
empiricalevidence!  You are creating equations out of thin air chosen to<br>
prove<br>
your pre-chosen conclusion in line with the memes you are carrying.<br>
Actually, I used to carry the same pluralist memes as you until I looked<br>
at some of the<br>
undeniable evidence of ruling class existence, activity, and dominance<br>
around<br>
1967.  Your reactions are not all unpredictable either.  All I have to<br>
do is listen<br>
to my own old tapes.<br>
<p>
     The feed back loop through which certain memes increase the<br>
politico-<br>
financial power of certain segments of society thereby increasing the<br>
resources<br>
available to propagate that meme should be key in any model of memetic<br>
infection.<br>
Society has very effective defenses against new memes.  These defenses<br>
are financed<br>
by big money.  Why do you avoid this aspect?  Huh?<br>
<p>
By the way:<br>
<p>
     All ideas become memes to the extent they spread and thereby create<br>
a new social organism however small or feeble, but not all memes are<br>
ideas in the sense of  modeling reality.   So, of course, everything I<br>
say can be deduced from my ideas (memes to the extent others share<br>
them).  The scientific method is our only test as to whether models are<br>
close enough to reality to be useful or just the "idea cement" or meme<br>
of some social entity.  Unfortunately, it is difficult indeed to apply<br>
the scientific method rigorously in the complex field of study we are<br>
discussing.  But apriori reasoning won't cut it.......<br>
