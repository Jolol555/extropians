For list members unfamiliar with jury nullification, here's a bit of<br>
background.<br>
<p>
In the very first jury trial before the U.S. Supreme Court, Chief<br>
Justice John Jay instructed the jury in this way: "It is presumed, that<br>
juries are the best judges of facts; it is on the other hand, presumed<br>
that courts are the best judges of law. But still both objects are<br>
within your power of decision... you have a right to take it upon<br>
yourselves to judge of both, and to determine the law as well as the<br>
fact in controversy". State of Georgia vs. Brailsford (3 Dall 1)<br>
<p>
Jurors not only have the duty to decide guilt or innocence, but also the<br>
"equity", or "inequity", of the law for which the defendant is accused.<br>
This means that juries have the ability to acquit a defendant based upon<br>
their own ideas of right and wrong, fairness, and their own conscience.<br>
If they feel that the laws against marijuana possession are unjust and<br>
unfair, then jury nullification suggests that they vote for acquittal,<br>
regardless of the judge's instructions. <br>
<p>
Because a jury's guilty verdict must be unanimous, it takes only one<br>
vote to effectively NULLIFY an unjust law. Regardless of legislative<br>
intent, or a judge's instructions to the jury, the jury, not the court,<br>
will make the decision to acquit. Though this may only cause a "hung"<br>
jury, and it won't be a true acquittal, at least the defendant will not<br>
be convicted of violating an unjust or unconstitutional law. Very often,<br>
defendants are not retried by the government, due to the high cost<br>
involved, and in this way juries send a very clear and powerful message.<br>
