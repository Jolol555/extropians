Hear, hear!  The more I study this Gaia that I am embedded within<br>
(Gaia being the biolayer, not the planet, which is Terra) the more<br>
my relationship to Gaia becomes a love-hate one.  She's Mom, all<br>
right... no question about that, and I do pay my props to Mama G...<br>
but I really think it's time for me to get out of the house before<br>
her odd habits and idiosyncrasies start driving me crazy.<br>

<p>
This is actually a heavy question within ethics.  I think I share<br>
Mark's preferences here... if I had the misfortune of finding myself<br>
alone in the cosmos, I would almost certainly set myself to the<br>
task of making other people, or at least fumbling my way through<br>
search space looking for an implementation path toward that end.<br>
(Lee Corbin's happy-boxes are just no good for a decent conversation.)<br>
But one real brain-stretcher for me is trying to think up arguments<br>
in favor of the continued existence of other people that I could<br>
present to some obdurate Robyn Hitchcock who sings "I'm not afraid<br>
to be the only person on the planet".  That coming up with such<br>
arguments that seem plausible to me is very difficult, scares me<br>
a bit.  But not much more than a good roller-coaster ride.<br>
<p>
(P. S. Is there a Pink Goo in the goo bestiary yet? If not, I<br>
suggest we use Pink Goo to refer to Old Testament apes who see<br>
their purpose as being fruitful and multiplying, filling up of the<br>
cosmos with lots more such apes, unmodified. Moravecians should<br>
get a charge out of throwing this one around. There are probably<br>
some interesting SubGenius interpretations for Pink Goo as well.<br>
I like it because it's morally ambiguous.  Sometimes I enthusiastically<br>
identify as a member of the Pink Goo horde (parents take note of<br>
this!).  But other times I think perhaps we ought to do something<br>
about the Pink Goo problem on this planet: Pink Goo can result in<br>
insufficient slack.)<br>
