<i>&gt;         &gt;Philip K. Dick, I believe, defined reality as that which doesn't        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt; go away when you stop believing in it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>

<i>&gt;         &gt;Is the Mandelbrot set like the gravitational field, or is the         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Mandelbrot set like Church and State (which I'm pretty confident         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;would go away, or at least change rather drastically, if everyone         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;stopped believing in them).</i><br>
..........<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In other words the Mandelbrot Set is consistent with the axioms of </i><br>
<i>&gt; mathematics, the axioms themselves have no proof but they just seem so true </i><br>
<i>&gt; they must be, I mean, they're really obvious, as obviously true as the nature </i><br>
<i>&gt; of reality is transparent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
...........<br>
<p>
***** In my point of view (and in lots of mathematics' too) the set <br>
of axioms that are the basis of a theory, do not need even to seem <br>
true. The mathematical concept of "truth" just appears after (and  <br>
based on) the existence of the axioms... For example, being <br>
formal, the Euclidean or Riemmanian Geometries do not need to having <br>
anything to do with truth or reality. Just with its own axioms... <br>
Just a comment.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I talked about consistency because that's as precise and objective a concept </i><br>
<i>&gt; as any known, truth on the other hand is as murky as reality. I also find  </i><br>
<i>&gt; there is very often a disturbing circular element. What is truth? That which </i><br>
<i>&gt; is (exists). What is existence? That which is true.  </i><br>
<p>
***** Mathematically is not that... Repeat that "truth" depends on <br>
the local axioms...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can't explain what truth is without using the idea of consistency, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't use the verb "to be" either because that implies existence and </i><br>
<i>&gt; existence is what I'm trying to define. All these restrictions are too much </i><br>
<i>&gt; for me, that's why I don't talk about truth.      </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
***** But if we consider as one of the axioms of the universe that  <br>
the universe is real, we could begin to think what would be the other <br>
minimal set of axioms (consistent with the existence, at least, <br>
of what would continue on existing if, for example, all the <br>
mankind would die...). After that we could try to define what is <br>
real and true, or not....  in other case I think we will be <br>
rationally lost and will begin to inventing mathematical religions...<br>
