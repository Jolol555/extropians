<i>&gt;The arguements as to the need for self-defense against predators in our</i><br>

<p>
No doubt Marshal Petain would agree with you.<br>
Certainly Pol Pot would find your answer a winning one.<br>
I manage to entertain some doubts.<br>
Each community is different. <br>
Feel free to live wherever you are comfortable.<br>
When respect for one's fellow man is strong, arms are an utter non-issue.<br>
Absent that respect, what remains?<br>

Dear fellow extropians and michael,<br>
<p>
It seems there is always someone who chooses to miss the point.<br>
Possibly, it's out of a simple need to act as devils advocate.<br>
I somehow doubt that either Petain or Pol Pot would agree with me on most,<br>
if not all, political issues. <br>
It seems that they both advocated conformity of mind and action and could<br>
not tolerate dissent. <br>
The open mind indicates open discussion and debate of all issues in order<br>
to increase human understanding. <br>
Shooting or otherwise killing someone does not get them to think.<br>
In fact, the reverse is true.<br>
