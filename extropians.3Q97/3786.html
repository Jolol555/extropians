The difference is major and *very* simple.  If you hold a gun to someone's<br>
head and burn their cocaine plants, and they resist you, then this perfectly<br>
innocent person becomes an EVIL CRIMINAL and goes to jail.  Coercive force<br>
means depriving someone, not merely of choice, but of *liberty*, which are two<br>
very different things.  A free man may have but a single choice:  To learn a<br>
new programming language so he doesn't go out of business.  A citizen of the<br>
U.S.A. has thousands of choices on his income tax form, but the government is<br>
still holding a gun to his head.  Eliminating a choice is different from<br>
coercing someone into making it.<br>

<i>&gt; Depriving someone of life, liberty or property through your intentional</i><br>

<p>
There is a difference between violence and theft, as someone said the last<br>
time I made the proposal.<br>
