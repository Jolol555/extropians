Yeah. This takes my thread back to where it derives from, Paul M.<br>
Churchland's work (and not just his) on "folk psychology" and the<br>
possibility (eliminative materialism) that hardly any of the words<br>
that we currently use to describe psychological phenomena have any<br>
actual referents.  Psychological phenomena might easily be concrete,<br>
real, physical, computational phenomena *without* having any kind<br>
of one-to-one correspondence with any of the words we currently<br>
use to talk about psychological phenomena. In other words, they<br>
might *matter* without being *real*, in the sense that there might<br>
not *really* be anything that corresponds to the words.  (Although<br>
things might be different with a future vocabulary of neuropsychology.)<br>
Obviously, it's difficult to be clear when speaking of such things,<br>
and I hope I'm not just making an ass of myself.<br>
<p>
It was interesting to me to see the same kind of process happening<br>
in word that is not obviously psychological in its content:<br>
"complexity". The source analogies (like the disappearance of<br>
"caloric") are all from physics because it is in physics that it<br>
is easiest to formulate new, alien, but very concrete paradigms<br>
that replace older ones and show their flaws and errors in a way<br>
that is much easier to perceive and think about clearly than changes<br>
of paradigm in, say, the social sciences.<br>
