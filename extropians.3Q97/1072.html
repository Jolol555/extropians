Geology has come a very long way since then. The contenental drift<br>
theory<br>
(Plate tectonics) hsa been around even longer, and indeed started from<br>
just the same observatin you mention: the contenents do fit together<br>
like a jigsaw puzzle in many places. The theory was initially<br>
disparaged,<br>
since it didn't fit the conventional wisdom of the time and since there<br>
wasn't much else going for it. Then, in the 1960's, came the Deep Sea<br>
Drilling Project (DSDP), in which the drill ship Glomar Challenger took<br>
a lot of drill samples from the ocean floor. The samples showed that<br>
the midocan ridges are very young, that the magnetic reversals are<br>
symmetric about the ridges, and that the crust gets progressively older<br>
as you move away from the ridges. Sure enough, it really did look like<br>
the<br>
whole thing is expanding! However, the alternative explanation was that<br>
the conental plates are being pushed away from the ridges and are<br>
overriding<br>
other plates or are banging into each other. Sure enough when geologists<br>
looked at the other side of the plates, they found subduction zones.<br>
These<br>
are places where one plate is overriding another. Siesmic studies have<br>
looked at these zones extensively. Siesmic data can be used to create a<br>
picture of the insides of the earth using a mathematical procedure<br>
known as tomography (the same math that is used with X-ray data to<br>
to a CAT scan). Data shows the subducted plates (which are still cold<br>
and dense compared to the upper mantle material) driving far down<br>
into the mantle. A lot of related phenomena (such as oceanic trenches<br>
and volcanic arcs) are highly correlates and with and easily explained<br>
by<br>
this theory. Counter-evidence is hard to come by, and a competing<br>
theory (such as expansion) will have to explain all of these phenomena<br>
before it can compete.<br>
<p>
Now I have a neat speculative theory for you: why does all the major<br>
motion<br>
seem to be toward the center of the Pacific, causing the "ring of fire?"<br>
Maybe something (antimatter meteor?) took a chunk out there and the<br>
earth<br>
is now adjusting? (Estimated silliness factor on this is 90%, but what<br>
the heck.)<br>

Comment from our geologist friends?<br>
