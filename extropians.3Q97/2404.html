Government sharpshooter "was aiming at the other guy" and missed...hitting<br>
and killing instead mother with infant in arms. Charged with involuntary<br>
manslaughter.<br>
<p>
Citizen attacked from ambush by government agents...returns fire in self<br>
defense ....killing one agent...is charged with first degree murder.<br>
<p>
 18 year old goat herder killed from ambush by U.S. Marines while tending<br>
goats on family farm...marines not charged with anything.<br>
<p>
And it goes on and on and on and on....I drive a truck...as I may have<br>
mentioned...and I travel the 48 states and parts of Canada...I listen to<br>
radio a lot...during my travels I hear this kinda stuff repeatedly....only I<br>
hear about a lot more than makes the national news...like that case in Ohio<br>
where the BATF broke in..caused injury to the wife such that she<br>
aborted...then left...sorry...wrong house.  Or the other "Waco" that occurred<br>
in Ohio...several dead...no national news coverage.<br>
<p>
What are we gonna do?<br>
