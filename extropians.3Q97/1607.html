I would love some feedback--the following is being published in this<br>
months Evolutionary Theory. Sorry for cross-postings. <br>

Thanks!<br>

                                Abstract<br>
<p>
Hyperthesis: a new classification for qualitative scientific concepts<br>
that are supported by overwhelming evidence <br>
<p>
<p>
        Scientific concepts are arranged within a flexible hierarchy and<br>
rigidly evaluated via the scientific method. The three main classes for<br>
scientific explanations are hypotheses, theories, and laws. Although all<br>
scientific concepts are accepted on a provisional basis, the theory of<br>
natural selection via differential reproduction is the highest regarded<br>
concept in the life sciences because so many lines of modern evidence<br>
support it. In fact, the revised, neodarwinian theory of natural<br>
selection provides the intellectual backdrop for current biological<br>
thought and research. Unlike physics, scientific laws are rare in<br>
biology because the complexities of living systems are not easily<br>
reduced into simple rules or elegant formulas; therefore, qualitative<br>
concepts like natural selection will never be replaced by any general,<br>
mathematical Law of Evolution. Unfortunately, the term "theory" in<br>
colloquial English also refers to an unproved idea that is likely wild<br>
speculation, false conjecture, or pure fantasy. As a result, many<br>
non-scientists, laypeople, and creationists misuse the word "theory" to<br>
suggest that natural selection and other valid concepts might be<br>
scientifically unsound. Since the theory of natural selection is the<br>
keystone principle of biology, there should be no discrepancy between<br>
the general public and the scientific community on how important and<br>
useful the concept of natural selection actually is. Therefore, I<br>
propose the hyperthesis (Gr. hyper, above + tithenai, to put), a new<br>
classification for scientific concepts which would currently be ranked<br>
as well supported, qualitative theories. Although natural selection via<br>
differential reproduction is both the ideal model and best example to<br>
illustrate the hyperthesis concept, many other theories in the<br>
biological and social sciences easily fit into this schema. Some critics<br>
might argue that this new term only adds another layer of complexity to<br>
the over-stretched vocabulary of scientists; however, the hyperthesis<br>
concept eliminates more confusion for non-scientists than it causes to<br>
the established jargon. Also, it should be noted that the term<br>
hyperthesis is a logical extension of the hierarchy of scientific<br>
concepts ( i.e. hypothesis, theory, hyperthesis) currently used by<br>
scientists worldwide.<br>
