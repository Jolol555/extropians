I'm not sure what you mean by a decision procedure for optimality. <br>
The values themselves I take as givens. They might be design in by <br>
its constructor or they may result from some accidental occurence; I <br>
don't assume that they can be deduced from some self-evident axioms <br>
or something.<br>
<p>
Given the values, it may or may not be trivial to translate them into <br>
micro-level descriptions of the value-optimal physical state. That <br>
depends on what the values are. But whatever they are, we can be <br>
pretty sure they are more likely to be made real by a <br>
superinelligence who holds those values than by one who doesn't. <br>
(Unless the values intrinsically involve, say,  respect for <br>
independent individuals or such ethical stuff.) The superintelligence <br>
realizes this and decides to junk the other computers in the <br>
universe, if it can, since they are in the way when optimising the <br>
SI's values.<br>
