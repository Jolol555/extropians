A big problem with using neutron stars as computational platforms (a.k.a.<br>
turning them into neuron stars) is that they might actually be kaon or<br>
strange stars, and who knows what the physics is then?  Gerald Brown and<br>
Hans Bethe have argued that the standard stellar dynamics narrative, in<br>
which gravitational collapse forces protons and electrons together (so to<br>
speak) to build neutrons and runaway neutrinos, might be only partially<br>
correct.  They suggest that the electrons might do a lepton=&gt;hadron<br>
transition, turning into kaons (which contain a strange quark).  Usually<br>
massive kaons decay mighty fast, but the Brown-Bethe models sez that the<br>
weird environment of a supernova remnant could allow kaons to shed most of<br>
their quarky mass (decoupling from the Higgs field? don't ask me, mate, I<br>
just work here), so they skid around like electrons in a superconductive<br>
environment.  Would you wish to upload into a substrate like that?  Maybe<br>
it would be ideal - fast and slippery.  Hmmm.<br>
