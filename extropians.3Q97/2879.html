It may well turn out that consciousness cannot be preserved in this way.  If<br>
you brain slowly converges with the machine, at about the same rate as your<br>
brain changes now, your conscious mind should be preserved.  However, if you<br>
dump the wetware and rebuild it in software or hardware you may end up making<br>
a seperate conscious mind.  Although that mind may seem the same to everyone<br>
else, and the mind itself may 'think' it's you, it might not actually be<br>
'you' (because you're dead).  And I'll just presume that you would rather be<br>
alive than have something that thinks it's you fooling all your friends.<br>
 This, of course, brings up points that have had no end of discussion on this<br>
list.<br>
