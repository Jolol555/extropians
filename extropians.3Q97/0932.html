[Andrea decides to see if there's a useful conversation in this thread,<br>
before Perry explodes upon realizing that this is someone who helps write<br>
"consumer protection" laws for New York.]<br>

I suspect this is true, and that is part of the problem that so many on<br>
this list have with these regulations.  Why don't we take the IRS rules<br>
about contractors as one example?  You said to Perry that we could<br>
comfortably expect these regulations to adapt to suit organizations as<br>
they<br>
change.  In fact, the IRS tightened the rules for when you can call<br>
someone<br>
a contractor just as many companies have started to use contracting<br>
heavily.  I have been asked by firms, for whom I believed I was clearly<br>
contracting, if I would please sign on as a temporary employee just to<br>
avoid IRS issues.<br>
<p>
If contract relationships are the wave of the future, why is the IRS<br>
making<br>
it so difficult to operate this way?  It's relatively easy to explain if<br>
you take a public choice approach and assume that the IRS wants to<br>
maximize<br>
it's revenue and power with little regard to the effect on the economy.<br>
How would you interpret the situation?<br>

Dear Andrea and other fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
It seems that the IRS regulations as it relates to independent contractors<br>
is as complex as it is because of the abuse of the independent contractors<br>
provisions by many small, virtual (and fly-by-night) organizations. <br>
<p>
Particularly, I've found that a large number of sales and migrant farm<br>
organizations tend to improperly hire young people as independent<br>
contractors in order to avoid many labor regulations. In an inordinately<br>
large number of incidents these young and quite unsophisticated people are<br>
exploited and ultimately abandoned without any assets by these<br>
unscrupulous companys throughout the country. Regrettably, the US<br>
Department of Labor and the IRS lack the staffing to prevent most of these<br>
horrible (approaching slavery) human rights abuses. <br>
<p>
As with many things the reality is far more complex and brutal than the<br>
ideal and the theory.<br>
<p>
Think about it some more.<br>
<p>
Enjoy!!!<br>
