The Invisibles <br>
<p>
The best comic to come out in many years.  Beautiful art and writing.<br>
Chock-full of dynamic optimism and spontaneous order.  Plus plenty of sex,<br>
drugs, and cool technology.  The good guys and the bad guys fight over which<br>
way the Singularity is going to go: total freedom or total control. <br>
<p>
Battle Angel Alita<br>
<p>
In the last few issues alone, the author has raised questions like: are<br>
cyborgs morally inferior to all-flesh humans immortalized by nanotechnology?<br>
What's the moral status of people whose minds have been uploaded to<br>
computers which are then placed in the brain case of their original body?<br>
How can we know we're not in a perfectly simulated world?  All these<br>
questions and more settled by grotesquely violent hand-to-hand combat!<br>
(sorry about that last, but hey, it's a comic book...)<br>
<p>
Transmetropolitan <br>
<p>
Only one issue out, so it's a little hard to tell.  The author is a fan of<br>
spontaneous order and utility fog.<br>
<p>
None of these are suitable for children, not even a little bit.<br>
