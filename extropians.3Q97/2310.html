<p>
Firstly, _Lord of the Flies_ is about 'civilised' children put in a situation<br>
where their 'civilised' values failed them, and gangs are rebellion against<br>
authority - both are products of civilisation.  I was suggesting a world of<br>
*learning* without *teaching* (used in terms of giving instruction rather<br>
than inspiration).  You'd be amazed how much a child learns of its own accord<br>
when not being taught, seeing and doing are far greater tools than being<br>
told.<br>
<p>
I'm not suggesting keeping children in isolation, we will still be there<br>
offering the usual advice.  Let's just do away with the current parent/child<br>
hierarchy, children can learn from their parent and parents can learn from<br>
their children as and when they want.<br>
