<i>&gt; &gt; shot of a human sitting on a couch looking at all of this, all in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; timeframe that is *amazingly* short (on the order of a couple of seconds).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is true, but of course television has only been available since the</i><br>

Can you say movies?<br>
Movies were very big in the decade before TV, and they also expose<br>
the brain to many quickly changing scenes.<br>
