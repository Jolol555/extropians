Interesting. So are you saying that it simply doesn't matter if<br>
a politician is (or all politicians are) lacking in character?<br>
Or if a political system reliably produces (rewards, whatever)<br>
only politicians who are lacking in character?<br>
<p>
Also, I am interested to hear your theory of how a participant in<br>
the democratic process should go about following "the cumulative<br>
thought processes, constraints, and contingencies" when deciding<br>
how to vote.  Most of the methods I have run across for attempting<br>
to keep track of these things either seem unreliable (I had thought<br>
that character was a good guide, but now you seem to be telling us<br>
that it is not) or else to take up so much of my time in researching<br>
my vote that I have no time left in which to earn taxes for the<br>
state.  <br>
<p>
This is especially the case where I live, in California, because<br>
we have an extensive system of initiative and referendum which<br>
requires a great deal of research to participate in in a meaningful<br>
way.  Of course, research is not literally *required*, so the<br>
results of the elections are sometimes a bit surrealistic.  I<br>
suppose that's why I like living in California.  I've always been<br>
fond of surrealism, and I find the political environment here<br>
to be quite Daliesque.<br>
<p>
(Oh, dear, I shouldn't have said that last.  It's clearly<br>
evidence that I need to get my head shrunk by professional<br>
help.  State-licensed, of course.)<br>
