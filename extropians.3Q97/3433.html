<i> &gt; Solution three:  Raise the standard of living.  Why hasn't this</i><br>

<i> &gt; supplies, and hence do not add to demand.</i><br>

Arkuat replies<br>
: No, the reason this hasn't happened is because of barriers to<br>
: trade and migration imposed by national governments.  If each<br>
: person on the planet had an global market for their stuff [...]<br>
<p>
Don't forget purely local employment-prevention laws, especially<br>
licensing and minimum wage.  Civilization, apparently, would crumble<br>
if the riffraff were allowed to braid hair or provide car rides for<br>
money, or if young people were allowed to learn good work habits<br>
at a dollar an hour.<br>
<p>
: Of course, some of the comfortable people living in the more<br>
: lucrative markets would be disturbed by having to compete with poor<br>
: and hungry people on the labor market, which is why such laws exist.<br>
: This is the answer to your question: the greed and indifference of<br>
: the comfortable and laws designed to protect their cushy lifestyle<br>
: from the poorer parts of the world. Tear 'em down, say I.<br>
<p>
Not much in that paragraph needs changing to fit my addition.<br>
<p>
Eliezer replies:<br>
: ...  I suppose I could tear down the<br>
: entire sociopolitical structure of the world if I really had to, but it<br>
: just seems easier to redesign the economy along more efficient lines -<br>
: design an economy that is to capitalism what capitalism is to communism.<br>
<p>
You reckon that abolishing money is easier than abolishing trade barriers?<br>
