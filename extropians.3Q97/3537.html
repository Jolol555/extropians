      (ADVANCE) HILTON HEAD, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 13, 1997--<br>
<p>
      GeneMatcher provides critical missing link for genomic research<br>
          Paracel Inc. today announced a new class of scientific computing<br>
for drug discovery that accelerates the analysis of genes that cause <br>
disease by as much as 1,000 times over traditional computing <br>
alternatives.<br>
          The GeneMatcher computer system will be introduced at the Ninth <br>
Genome Sequencing and Analysis Conference, Hilton Head, S.C., Sept.  <br>
13-16.<br>
          GeneMatcher is the first computer designed with custom <br>
Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) technology to <br>
specifically analyze genetic information.  GeneMatcher precisely <br>
analyzes similarities and differences of DNA or protein sequences in <br>
relation to other sequences of known genetic location and function.  <br>
These comparisons provide researchers with critical insight towards <br>
identification of genomic drug targets and potential therapies.<br>
          "With global genomic databases doubling in size every 10 months, <br>
high-throughput data analysis is a critical missing link for <br>
biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies involved in drug <br>
discovery," said Kwang-I Yu, Ph.D., CEO of Paracel.  "Researchers no<br>
longer have to settle for less than optimal methods when searching <br>
for new pharmaceutical products."<br>
          Paracel's existing customers see a large role for the GeneMatcher<br>
technology in their bioinformatics departments.<br>
          "Genomic research laboratories are moving from a craftsman to a <br>
factory model, and this requires new high-throughput computational <br>
tools," said R. Mark Adams, Ph.D., director of bioinformatics at <br>
AlphaGene Inc., a functional genomics company in Woburn, Mass., and a<br>
Paracel customer.<br>
          "Currently we have to perform extensive planning to work around <br>
computing bottlenecks.  The GeneMatcher system will allow AlphaGene <br>
to perform `what if' bioinformatics without waiting," Adams said.  <br>
"We perceive that GeneMatcher will offer us a competitive <br>
`time-to-market' advantage in delivering drug targets to our <br>
pharmaceutical partners."<br>
          Tim Hunkapiller, Ph.D., assistant professor of molecular <br>
biotechnology at the University of Washington, was one of the first <br>
scientists to recognize the need for powerful computers in biology <br>
during the late 1980s while at Caltech in Pasadena.<br>
          "GeneMatcher has arrived at a time when the requirement for <br>
high-throughput sequence analysis has never been greater,"  <br>
Hunkapiller said.  "GeneMatcher is essential if genomic research is <br>
to continue at an ever-increasing pace."<br>
          Spanning a significant, two-year engineering effort, Paracel will<br>
begin production shipments of GeneMatcher the first quarter of 1998.<br>
"The GeneMatcher chip, with a complexity of over 2.2 million <br>
transistors, is the first custom ASIC commercially deployed for <br>
genomic data analysis," said Richard J. Diephuis, Ph.D., vice <br>
president of engineering at Paracel.<br>
          "By combining 6,912 GeneMatcher processors into a single deskside <br>
package, we will provide researchers the ability to analyze genomic <br>
information at speeds never before possible."  (Editor's note:  a <br>
transistor is a measure of silicon chip density.  By comparison, a <br>
general purpose computing Pentium chip by Intel has 3.3 million <br>
transistors.) <br>
      The GeneMatcher system is a plug-and-play computation server that<br>
can be connected to any network.  It is delivered with BioView Tool <br>
Kit, a suite of software tools from Paracel, providing both a <br>
Web-based or UNIX command line interface.  This allows the product to<br>
be easily used and integrated into any bioinformatics environment.<br>
          The GeneMatcher chip is designed to specifically analyze genetic <br>
information.  The custom ASIC approach allows for performance that <br>
has not been achieved by others using off-the-shelf Field <br>
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) programmed to perform sequence <br>
analysis functions.  Combined with Paracel's existing Fast Data <br>
Finder (FDF) technology for text analysis, the GeneMatcher system <br>
architecture includes capability for sequence annotation searching.<br>
          Paracel, founded in 1992, provides high performance text and<br>
genomic data analysis systems for pharmaceutical, biotechnology and <br>
government markets.  Paracel is a privately held company located in <br>
Pasadena, Calif.  Additional background information on Paracel is <br>
