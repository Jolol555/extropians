<p>
Yes, but I wouldn't trivialize it with the label "semantic" because that's <br>
exactly what Science is all about, showing how 2 apparently different things <br>
are really related on a deeper level.  Electric and magnetic fields seemed to <br>
have very different properties, then in the greatest discovery of 19'th<br>
century Physics, Faraday and Maxwell proved that there was a profound <br>
relationship between the two and both were instances of the set Y, set Y <br>
being Electromagnetism.<br>

<p>
             <br>
Except that nobody has a definition of reality that's worth a damn, but <br>
that's OK, definitions are vastly overrated, we seldom use one and even less <br>
seldom need one. Forget about "reality", I want to know if the Mandelbrot Set <br>
is different in some very fundamental way from the Virgo Cluster. Can I put <br>
both things in the same general category, a category that excludes neutral<br>
electrons, square circles or integer square roots of 7? My suspicion is that <br>
there is no very fundamental difference between a mathematical object and a <br>
physical one, but I don't know that for a fact and if I'm wrong I'd like to <br>
know precisely what the difference is. You're objection seems to be that<br>
proving or disproving such things is doomed to failure, you could very well <br>
be right, but that is yet another thing I don't know for a fact.<br>
             <br>

<i>        &gt;The use of e-prime sometimes points out when a question has this        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;property. </i><br>
             <br>
<p>
I'm skeptical that e-prime is an aid to clear thinking. Every human language <br>
has "to be" in it and in every natural language it is irregular, indicating  <br>
it's in very common usage (Turkish has only one irregular verb, "to be"). <br>
If a simple mutation like dropping one word could confer the huge advantages <br>
to the user that the advocates of e-prime claim, then some language would<br>
probably have evolved in that direction and rapidly spread around the world. <br>
English has rapidly spread around the world but it has "to be" and more <br>
irregular verbs than anyone.<br>
