The problem is bigger than this in some ways, and smaller in others.<br>
Bigger: much of the older software in question uses 2-digit years. But<br>
software written back then also very often uses the convention that<br>
a "don't know" or "don't care" or "not filled in yet" is coded as<br>
"99". So this class of problem must be solved starting now. Example:<br>
query your sales forcasting database for projects sales 18 months from<br>
now.<br>
<p>
Smaller: a lot of operational embedded computers don't CARE what<br>
the date is, and a great many that do, use UNIX time, which is<br>
measured as the number of seconds since 1 Jan 1970. (Apparently,<br>
that was the actual beginning of the universe.) This is carried<br>
as a 32 bit number, which means that the end of the univers is<br>
in Feb 2106.<br>
