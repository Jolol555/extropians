<i>&gt; I wish I had an answer but unfortunately no-one on earth knows for sure.</i><br>
<i>&gt; IMHO, there are many genetic errors that affect us after our sexual</i><br>
<i>&gt; peek, they could be a lot of things. Ever hear of the telomerase theory?</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are others, personally I think that if only one error would be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; cause for aging, natural selection would already have solved our aging</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem. See my "Why are We Allowed to Age?" article for more on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolution of aging at:</i><br>

The following is a discussion of evolution.  Any anthropomorphic speech<br>
should be taken metaphorically.<br>
<p>
  Unfortunately, the selection pressure towards indefinate longevity is<br>
very weak.  Natural selection favors selection of replicators that<br>
replicate.  That is, once an organism has finished breeding and rearing<br>
children there is no particular evolutionary advantage in living much<br>
longer, and one could argue even a disadvantage, as that individual would<br>
take up resources that could be used by the younger, breeding generation.<br>
Natural selection not only favors reproduction, but also favors the<br>
preservation of siblings and cousins, as they also share some of the<br>
individual's genes.  Primates (including early humans)typically live in<br>
packs in which many if not all of the members are interrelated.  If long<br>
living genes resulted in resources being taken away from nephews and<br>
cousins, there would actually be a selection pressure towards shorter life<br>
spans.  In this situation evolution would have no incentive to make<br>
lifespans a great deal longer than reproductive age.  Rather, evolution<br>
would guide lifespans into a certain range, long enough to reproduce and<br>
raise children, but not so long that there are too many old barren mouths<br>
to feed.  A rough estimate of this timespan in humans would be 60 years,<br>
assuming<br>
that the children are protected, taught, cared for a much lengthier period<br>
than in most animals, and this seems to be born out by what actually<br>
happens in humans.  It is generally considered that sometime in the early<br>
to mid<br>
60s is the time when people stop doing much productive work and start<br>
resting on their laurels and Social Security benefits until they die.<br>
    Also keep in mind that in the past many more people did not survive to<br>
full maturity.  Any genetic trait that exchanges robustness in youth for<br>
more problems in old age would be favored.  Cell repairs fall into this<br>
category.  Typically, aging damage is not a significant threat to survival<br>
until well after reproductive years.  Maintaining the body in peak<br>
condition throughout breeding age would require spending energy that might<br>
be better used otherwise.  This may be an explanation of why people pass<br>
out of reproductive age.  The first place that cell damage will cause<br>
serious problems is when damaged sperm or eggs pass their inheritence to<br>
an embryo.  This is why woman over 40 having children have a much higher<br>
risk of having babies with Down's Syndrome.  A Down's baby is<br>
reproductively speaking an enormous waste of energy, especially when it<br>
comes to caring for it after it is born.  Maintaining the body in peak<br>
condition is too likely to lead to starvation, so there is a gradual<br>
tapering off of fertility until the end result is a barren organism with<br>
little in the way of evolutionary pressures.  One sidenote is to observe<br>
that men are fertile quite a bit after woman.  This may be that men<br>
produce sperm constantly, while all eggs are produce prior to birth.  This<br>
means the eggs have much more time to suffer cellular damage, and further<br>
fertility because evolutionarily untenable sometime in the 40s.<br>
	To get superlongevity we'll have to bootstrap and cast away our<br>
genetic history.  We can engineer our genes, and now have the capability<br>
to create guided evolution that favors maximum lifespans of the<br>
individual.  Here is an interesting question to ponder:  If we genetically<br>
engineer a race of apes to have lifespans in excess of 200 years, and then<br>
drop them on a nice planet somewhere, would natural selection gradually<br>
undo what humans had done and reduce lifespan to a much shorter length?<br>
It may be that genetic traits that we would consider to be a good idea<br>
need the constant maintainence of civilization to maintain, and would not<br>
last indefinately in the constantly resource scarce environment of pure<br>
competition.<br>
<p>

process read Richard Dawkings 'River Out of Eden'<br>
