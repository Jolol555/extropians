Can I do a bit of lexical nagging?  (Yes, again.)  What's being discussed<br>
in this thread *isn't* `cloning', (which has an exact denotation) - it's<br>
wholesale duplication.  The only kind we're likely to see, given known<br>
physics, is uploading a brain to a computer substrate and then copying the<br>
whole thing.  <br>
<p>
Anders and his Aleph mates have a useful term for this as-yet imaginary<br>
procedure: xoxing a xox (from xeroxing).  The moment of duplication is<br>
`forking'.  <br>
<p>
I like it, if only because it has a rather charming Dr Seuss tone to it.<br>
Karen Cassidy, posting on the Moles ng, imagined the consequences:<br>
<p>
Fox, fox, fox and xox,<br>
Xox, xox, xox in box<br>
Fox in socks, xox on blocks,<br>
Throw some rocks with fox and xox.<br>
<p>
and asked, `But how could the illustrator differentiate between the fox and<br>
its xox?'  Someone else instantly noted that the xox would be the one with<br>
the branch (but I think that would be the original, in fact).<br>
