<p>
I'll throw in with that. <br>
<p>
First, I don't see how a split creates liquidity since no new shares are<br>
being sold. As I understand it, it's a board decision to halve the value<br>
of a share thereby doubling the number already in existence. Wouldn't it<br>
be nice if a corporation could create liquid capital just by cutting its<br>
share price?<br>
<p>
Second, a stock split lowers price per share allowing more investors to<br>
buy a greater number of shares. This has the common effect on share<br>
price -- an increase.<br>
<p>
Third, a corporation will not split its shares unless it has a pretty<br>
damn good idea that it expects a few good fiscal years ahead. This<br>
because a downward fluctuation of say 1/4 point is multiplied by the<br>
number of shares. The more shares, the greater the damage to the asset<br>
column.<br>
<p>
Finally, investors are more likely to buy shares at a low or mid-range<br>
price than a very high price. To keep the share price going up steadily,<br>
the board should split when it can. <br>
<p>
Just a thought or two,<br>
<p>
