Hi Shaun !<br>
<i>&gt;  I have always disliked the whole idea of "left" and "right" in</i><br>
<i>&gt;politics (or non-politics, as it may be.)  By saying that one is "left</i><br>
<i>&gt;wing" it gives the impression that the person in question has *only* lef=</i><br>
t<br>
<i>&gt;wing tendencies when they may possess many "right wing" qualities as wel=</i><br>
l.<br>
<p>
Of course, left-right is very reductionnist way of thinking. I personnaly=<br>
<p>
don't share most of the philosophical or artistical values of my<br>
"left-winged" friends. I always found Sartre, Foucault or Derrida boring =<br>
to<br>
the utmost! But people think with packages. for instance, most<br>
"free-market" people hate abortion, women's lib, drug use, and  are<br>
(frequently) christian fundamentalists and creationists. Our first attemp=<br>
t<br>
must be to go behind these "packages". I think the core "socialist values=<br>
"<br>
can be freed from their depressive thinking, as the core "capitalist<br>
values" can be freed from social and political conservatisms. In this pos=<br>
t<br>
, for the clarity of discussion,( and avoiding flames!)  I'll continue to=<br>
<p>
use the terms "left" and "right" to design the "core" values. =<br>

ly<br>

<i>&gt;virtually nothing to feed the starving and homeless, then their position=</i><br>
<p>
is<br>
<i>&gt;pretty obvious.</i><br>
<p>
I'd prefer to ask: since the governement exists, and we cannot destroy it=<br>
<p>
next sunday after lunch, how to use it ? I prefer to see it feed the<br>
homeless rather than using my money for army or making gifts to big<br>
corporations....<br>

Uh, really ? don't you do the same cult-like dichotomy by saying Hitler w=<br>

a left-wing extremist ? I lurk this list since several weeks, and I thoug=<br>

<i>&gt;This, of course, begs the question.  The anarcho-(socialist,</i><br>
<i>&gt;syndicalist, communist) claim is that property, such as owning a car</i><br>
<i>&gt;which isn't used 90% of the time, or land you've never even visited when=</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;there are landless peasants starving in megacity slums, is theft and</i><br>

<i>&gt;utilizing coercion (oxymoron!), or adapting socialist techniques."</i><br>
<p>
Exactly. Every act of privatization begins by an enclosure act ("this is<br>
mine: I will kill anybody who enter here") which is an act of cercion. =<br>
<p>
The main difference between (sorry for the crude terms) left anarchy and<br>
right anarchy is that the second see "The state" and "the Market" as<br>
opposing entities, and that the first sees the State as simple<br>
superstructure used by the wealthies to protect their rights against the<br>
"have-not". They are therefore allies, more: state is just the<br>
institutional representation of the property system. =<br>
<p>
An other difference is more semantic. I suspect right-anarchist to use th=<br>
e<br>
term "market" as a model of any kind of free interaction, as the left<br>
anarchists see in "market" only one kind of interaction. "Free markets",<br>
according to this definition,  is therefore,  to use Bateson's terms, a<br>
"maximisation of one variable", which can be disastrous to the whole<br>
system, built on many variables. =<br>
<p>
<p>
We all use everyday an anarcho-socialist system which works quite well: t=<br>
he<br>
internet. Here, most of the informations are given for free, and everybod=<br>
y<br>
understand that for the system to work, they must give information as muc=<br>
h<br>
as they take. When you go to a site where there is some valuable<br>
information that you must pay (I grant you an exclusive license, blah,<br>
blah, etc), do you immediately give your Visa Card number, or do you go<br>
back to Alta vista or Excite to see if somebody doesn't offer you the sam=<br>
e<br>
information for free? =<br>
<p>
Anarcho-socialism works pretty well like the iterated prisonner's dilemna=<br>
=2E<br>
I will share my goods if i know that, on the long run, I will beneficiate=<br>
<p>
of the others goods.Of course the benefit must be higher than the "price"=<br>
<p>
of my contribution, otherwise the system would not work (And this implies=<br>
,<br>
IMO, a high technological level, such as the Culture's).   In the realm o=<br>
f<br>
Internet we see that most  companies such as Microsoft or Sun  found<br>
necessary to give for free a big amount of their products simply to be ab=<br>
le<br>
to sell some.(See internet Explorer or the JDK). To save the capitalist<br>
system, they are therefore compelled to cope with a "socialist" way of<br>
exchange.  Here we see that things are never completely opposites, like i=<br>
n<br>
a chess game. We are here in a very complex game of Go.  =<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;"Left" anarchy is nothing more than intellectual masturbation for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;socialist and communist ideological refugees, particulary in the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Ideological refugees?  Anarcho-communism is at least as old as Marxism.</i><br>
<p>
Of course. Bakounin participated with Marx at the 1st Internationale, and=<br>
<p>
he was the fist to predict that Marxist ideas would be dangerous to<br>
freedom. Since, communists killed enough anarchists (especially during th=<br>
e<br>
Spain war, where they  were officially allies) to demonstrate their<br>
ideological differences..<br>
