Does a fully privatized economy have any use for ICBMs?<br>
Perhaps they might go away for lack of demand.  While this may<br>
not seem likely to some, it's a possibility which should not be<br>
dismissed out of hand.<br>

<p>
I don't think they are there for securing oil-supply so much as<br>
they are there for securing the control of oil-supply by US and<br>
European governments (not the same as US and European people).<br>
The people who own the oil (or try to, if you're thinking of Saddam<br>
Hussein) aren't going to make any money by refusing to sell it to<br>
the people who need it.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; How about law-enforcement? </i><br>
<p>
A complex question, difficult to discuss in full detail on a mailing<br>
list of this sort.  Have you looked into David Friedman's book THE<br>
MACHINERY OF FREEDOM?  That's a good place to start.  Another good<br>
one (and much more recent) is Bruce Benson's THE ENTERPRISE OF LAW.<br>
