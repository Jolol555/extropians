Dear EvMick and other fellow Extropians:<br>
One of our other correspondents complained that most people were unable or<br>
unwilling to accept responsibility for their actions -- or inactions -- in<br>
working for representative government.<br>
If those we elect become corrupt than we must blame ourselves for<br>
permitting conditions to occur which encourages corruption. Our options<br>
are to remove those who become corrupt and fail to represent us<br>
adequately, and correct the defects in the system that allows and/or<br>
provides the environment for corruption.<br>
For those who complain that too many of us do not vote and claim in<br>
defense that their vote has no effect on the system, I say that every vote<br>
has an effect whether our candidates win or loose.<br>
It might be interesting to consider some sort of proportional<br>
representation system.<br>
The United States and Great Britian seem to be the only major nations left<br>
that have not yet adopted such a plan. <br>
Possibly, that plus major campaign reform and public financing might<br>
eliminate some of our administrative democratic problems?<br>

In a message dated 97-09-06 09:17:47 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; As to placing responsibility, the responsibility is all ours -<br>
 individually and collectively.<br>
 Don't blame the politicians as much as you blame yourself for choosing to<br>
 give them the power and authority that they can either use productively<br>
 for the benefit of society or abuse to society's detriment. &gt;&gt;<br>
t <br>
Interesting...I engaged in a "diatribe" against these very same and was<br>
called a "ignorant ideolouge"...<br>
<p>
<p>
And I didn't vote for ANY winners in recent years...although I did<br>
vote...yet<br>
as the non investigations into acknowledged voter fraud in Louisana and<br>
California proves...the system is broken...it's all corrupt.<br>
