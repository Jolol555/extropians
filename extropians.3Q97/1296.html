<p>
I had just finished writing up my unified theory, turned the television on<br>
and there it was (honest!)<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;       Yes it is a problem and one worth clarifying.  Devoting energy </i><br>
<i>&gt;       myopically to traditional methods of focused intention (meditation, </i><br>
<i>&gt;       prayer) and not considering what physical actions to be taken is</i><br>
where <br>
<i>&gt;       the problem is.  Simple imbalance.  If this same woman was hungry, </i><br>
<i>&gt;       would she pray to be satiated by her higher power or would she go and</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       fix herself something to eat? </i><br>
<p>
Judging by the woman, she has no problem feeding herself.  However, before<br>
she eats the food she would no doubt thank god.  Just as so many people<br>
"thank god for being alive" instead of the surgeon.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       Me thinks the woman's comments, however lauded by the</i><br>
likely-simpleton <br>
<i>&gt;       audience were not about genuine concern for the welfare of these kids</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       but yet another opportunity to grandstand about her belief system and</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       her perceived superiority within it.</i><br>
<p>
I have oftened wondered why the belief that everything good is God's work and<br>
everything bad is your own doing leads to a feeling of superiority.  There's<br>
some weird psychology going on in the heads of these people.  Unfortunately<br>
for us, they represent a large majority which holds us back.  It's a real<br>
shame to see potential computing power go to waste!<br>
