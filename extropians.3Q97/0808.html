     I said in a post regarding planetary impact of "taker" cultures: <br>
     <br>
     "Since we've evolved beyond what nature intends ...looks like there is <br>
     still some evolving to do..."<br>
            <br>
     <br>
     EvMick responded:<br>
     <br>
     I would recommend books by Richard Dawkin. "Selfish Gene, Blind <br>
     Watchmaker, River Out of Eden" to back up my assertion that nature <br>
     doesn't "intend" anything.<br>
     <br>
     I respond:<br>
     <br>
     Thanks for flagging that.  I wasn't "intent"ionally imbuing sentience <br>
     into nature (but not presuming to deny a planetary consciousness <br>
     either).  <br>
     <br>
     I also want to clarify what I think is an impression that ancient <br>
     civilizations lived passively to the environment.  Certainly the <br>
     ancient empires wrought their havoc on their "world" in ways similarly <br>
     to the way we are today.  I should stress that it's not the aggressive <br>
     world dominating powers that malign the planet that is preferable over <br>
     the simple aboriginal whose survival is based on the elements and <br>
     their ability to outwit it or be lucky.  There's a place in between <br>
     though where everyone would be better off I would guess.<br>
     <br>
