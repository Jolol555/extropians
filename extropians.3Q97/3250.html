<i>&gt;  &gt;Even if that problem were solved (as is not unlikely), I would</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;refuse organ donation under the present government because it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;not currently legal for my heirs to receive the fair market value</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;of my cellular property. Better it should go to waste than be</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;subjected to altruism at gunpoint.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; With all due respect; I am having some serious trouble with the last sentence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; maybe this is a cultural difference between our respective home-country's</i><br>
<i>&gt; or just a difference between you and me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is problably not fair that heirs don't get good cash for donated organs</i><br>
<i>&gt; but IMHO it would be terribly unfair to let a person die for lack of organs</i><br>
<i>&gt; when a perfectly suitable organ is rotting away in a grave somewhere.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Please don't misunderstand: I'm not saying one is "better" than the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; just that I'm having *real* difficulty to follow your thinking here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And where did the "gunpoint" come from (didn't we already agree to disagree</i><br>
<i>&gt; on this subject - for now anyway ;-)?</i><br>
<p>
The "gunpoint" is that of the government arresting and jailing my<br>
heirs for signing a freely-negotiated fully-consenting contract for<br>
the sale of my organs.  Breaking the tyranny of a government that<br>
doesn't even recognize a man's most fundamental property--that of<br>
his own body--does far more for the future of humanity than saving<br>
one life in the short-term.  I am not such hard-line capitalist that<br>
I object to the idea of altruism itself, especially after I have no<br>
personal use for my property, but a government that approves of theft<br>
and a people that allow it are far more dangerous to the future than<br>
one stubborn old capitalist.<br>
