<p>
I think the point is that the current term is ambiguous, which is<br>
guaranteed to cause misuse.<br>
<p>
I agree that it's important that there be a new word, though I agree with<br>
Sumner who pointed out that trying to get people to use the word<br>
"hyperthesis" would be a hard fought battle.  I know I couldn't guess the<br>
definition just by looking at it, and that's half the battle with a neologism.<br>
<p>
I feel like "consensum," or some other word derived from "consensus" might<br>
fair better.  Consensum would be defined as "the judgment arrived at by<br>
most of those concerned," or "that which has been concluded by consensus."<br>
<p>
This word provides a number of important advantages.  First, it's fairly<br>
obvious within context as to what "consensum" means. ("Consensum of<br>
evolution?  The Big Bang consensum?  Well, it must be related to<br>
consensus...")  This is important, particularly when talking to people who<br>
will have had little Greek or scientific education.  <br>
<p>
However, it is obviously different from consensus, ending in "um" which<br>
gives it the sound of empricism.  It rings of "momentum."  All this works<br>
together to make people think that they have heard the word before; that<br>
the word is actually very OLD and if they just thought a bit they would<br>
remember the definition.  IMHO this trait is much more memetically useful<br>
than the sexier "hyperthesis" (which is sexy primarily because of the<br>
hyper- prefix), because it makes a person think that the word is already in<br>
use, and that they use a new OLD word by using it.<br>
<p>
A secondary but equally useful advantage is that it also infers that most<br>
people already agree with the "consensum," much like calling yourself the<br>
"Moral Majority" or the Bolshevik party makes it appear that you are<br>
actually in the majority.  When used with a self-titled "creation<br>
scientist," it emphasizes that the theist argues against a well established<br>
majority.<br>
<p>
I think this term conveys meaning better while also filling in the painful<br>
gap we find between "theory" and "law."  Thoughts?<br>
