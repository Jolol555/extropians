PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON: "A great industrial Nation is controlled<br>
by its system of credit.  Our system of credit is concentrated.  <br>
The growth of the Nation and all our activities are in the hands of <br>
a few men.  We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the <br>
most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the world <br>
-- no longer a Government of free opinion no longer a Government by<br>
conviction and vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion<br>
and duress of small groups of dominant men".  (Just before he died,<br>
Wilson is reported to have stated to friends that he had been<br>
"deceived" and that "I have betrayed my Country".  He referred to <br>
the Federal Reserve Act passed during his Presidency.) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From "The Economic Rape of America, What You Can Do About It":</i><br>
<p>
WHO OWNS THE FEDERAL RESERVE?<br>
<p>
There has been much speculation about who owns the Federal Reserve<br>
Corporation.  It has been one of the best kept secrets of the<br>
century, because the Federal Reserve Act Act of 1913 provided that<br>
the names of the owner banks be kept secret.  However, R. E. <br>
McMaster publisher of the newsletter The Reaper, asked his Swiss <br>
banking contacts which banks hold the controlling stock in the <br>
Federal Reserve Corporation.  The answer: <br>
<p>
1. Rothschild Banks of London and Berlin <br>
2. Lazard Brothers Bank of Paris <br>
3. Israel Moses Sieff Banks of Italy <br>
4. Warburg Bank of Hamburg and Amsterdam <br>
5. Lehman Brothers Bank of New York <br>
6. Kuhn Loeb Bank of New York <br>
7. Chase Manhattan Bank of New York <br>
8. Goldman Sachs Bank of New York<br>
<p>
In The Secrets Of The Federal Reserve, Eustace Mullins indicates<br>
that, because the Federal Reserve Bank of New York sets interest<br>
rates and controls the daily supply and price of currency throughout<br>
the U.S., the owners of that bank are the real directors of the<br>
entire system.  Mullins states: <br>
<p>
"The shareholders of these banks which own the stock of the <br>
Federal Reserve Bank of New York are the people who have controlled <br>
our political and economic destinies since 1914.  They are the<br>
Rothschilds, Lazard Freres (Eugene Mayer), Israel Sieff, Kuhn Loeb<br>
Company, Warburg Company, Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, the<br>
Rockefeller family, and the J.P. Morgan interests."<br>
