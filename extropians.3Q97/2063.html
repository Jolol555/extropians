I think we should maximize the integral of intelligence over time.<br>
Both methods may be workable; a lot of intelligence in a short time,<br>
a bit less for a very long time.<br>

My guess is that we do not need to blow up the sun as soon as<br>
possible (even if we have the technology), since we can spread among<br>
the stars. But when all of the galaxy has been dysoned and the<br>
inhabitants of the solar system realize they can't expand outwards,<br>
they might start to think about doing some stellar engineering...<br>
<p>
Actually, I think it might be a great idea to divide the stars into a<br>
lot of small red dwarfs instead of these beautiful but wasteful G and<br>
F stars (not to mention the giants!) - that will save a lot of<br>
otherwise wasted matter and energy and give us space for a lot of<br>
dyson spheres. <br>
