My first reaction to the criteria (as I posted) was that they compose<br>
the "final step." I tend to agree that $250,000 is less valuable at that<br>
point than the bragging rights.  	<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I suspect that there is an implicit assumption of a particular path</i><br>
<i>&gt; towards nanotech where these devices would in fact represent an inter-</i><br>
<i>&gt; mediate point.  The fact that 32 copies are needed presents a hint.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Specifically, an atomic force microscope enhanced with interchangeable</i><br>
<i>&gt; tips which can catalyze certain bonds might work.  You'd probably only</i><br>
<i>&gt; be able to build one or a few copies of the nano device, so 32 would</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps be within reach.</i><br>
<p>
Foresight is steeped in Drexler -- he's the friggin' Chairman for pete's<br>
sake! Why would they do that? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even if this is the explanation, I would still complain that the FI ought</i><br>
<i>&gt; not to be endorsing one particular path and designing a prize which only</i><br>
<i>&gt; makes sense if that path is followed.  </i><br>
<p>
That holds water for me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (Personally I think the biotech</i><br>
<i>&gt; route to a protein assembler makes more sense.)</i><br>
<p>
I don't have the science background to assign a sensibility to either<br>
case, but I do know that Drexler's works are persuasive to a layman. Can<br>
you point me to discussions concerning likely route technologies other<br>
than the Drexlerian biotech route?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I read that law review article you posted, but I felt that they missed</i><br>
<i>&gt; the point.  The authors seemed to think that the difficulty would arise</i><br>
<i>&gt; in trying to fit nanotech into the current regulatory framework.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; went into a lot of detail about how it would be hard to decide whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; an in situ nanotech cell repair system was a drug or a medical device.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My feeling is that it is more likely that nanotech will provoke the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same over-reaction as biotech, namely that research on it will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; heavily restricted.  There will be different levels of containment</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessary, only certain kinds of designs will be allowed, working with</i><br>
<i>&gt; biological specimens will be restricted, certain applications will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; "born classified" as is the case with nuclear research, ethical review</i><br>
<i>&gt; committees will have to sign off on any new direction for research, etc.</i><br>
<p>
I agree. I'm considering an approach based upon the biotech and GE<br>
regulatory models. Perhaps a critique of sorts, where they went wrong,<br>
effects, etc. There's been a lot more written on those topics than<br>
nanotech to say the least. One good point made in that article was the<br>
necessity of reasoning by analogy. Theorizing is only possible in<br>
science due to physical law -- there are things that we can do and<br>
things we can't. The only reference point in the legal realm is what we<br>
have as law already. Analogy is the weakest form of argumentation, but<br>
in the case of nanotech regulation predictions, it is the best<br>
predictive tool I can think of.    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; All this regulation is likely to hinder the rate of progress in nanotech</i><br>
<i>&gt; development, and may even limit it so much that only the military is in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a position to develop advanced nano.</i><br>
<p>
Or Japan, since the Japanese government has been sinking yen into MITI,<br>
ERATO, PERI and a zillion other acronyms for a few years now (look at<br>
Drexler's article in Foresight #9 for some details).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Nanotech will be regulated, I am certain. My hope is that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; regulations will correctly balance the risk-return equation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Who can know what the right answers are?  We all know that both the</i><br>
<i>&gt; risks and return are almost incalculably high.  I certainly don't claim</i><br>
<i>&gt; to know what the right path is to steer around the dangers.</i><br>
<p>
Nor does anyone that I know of. But, I'm optomistic that given<br>
sufficient forethought, societal future shock is avoidable.<br>
