     Not being a scientist, only fascinated by it, I probably take a <br>
     decidedly different path from the more high-brow attitudes towards <br>
     topics that occasionally surface on this digest and are ceremoniously <br>
     doused (heaven forbid the "Goo" thread was ever so quickly dismissed) <br>
     because of their "Moulder" rather than "Scully" like quality. (I'm <br>
     using pop icons as adjectives...wild!)<br>
     <br>
     For instance, in the area of Crop Cirlces, about which I know <br>
     relatively little, it is an intriguing notion to think that they might <br>
     be communications (such as those suggested in the film "Contact").  A <br>
     scientific mind may seek to discredit crop circles as hoaxes by <br>
     pointing out the "proof" that they are man-made. In my mind, that <br>
     doesn't take into account a number of variables, many, alas, <br>
     metaphysical in nature and thus, likely discreditable under classic <br>
     scientific scrutiny.<br>
     <br>
     However, I consider that the circles, whether they be hoaxes done by <br>
     clever humans or cryptic messages from an advances off-world race, to <br>
     be a fascinating phenomenon, at least archetypally and sociologically. <br>
      Some "hoaxes" are deliberate, confessed after the fact to be so, not <br>
     to discredit but to continue a dialog in earnest.  The human-made <br>
     circles I'm told are often done with the utmost reverence, employing <br>
     sacred geometry, considering time and location thoughtfully and <br>
     planned out for months in advance.<br>
     <br>
     One might say that such an elaborate hoax and expenditure of time is <br>
     all for naught.  But even the effect it has on the different camps of <br>
     thought on the legitmacy of crop circles is a fascinating byproduct <br>
     for it "shakes the tree of knowledge" so to speak.  Whether it <br>
     provokes with fascination or irritates and divides groups of <br>
     discussion, it has its place.  <br>
     <br>
     The real world of qualified scientific phenomenon may well be utterly <br>
     more fascinating than the more fanciful and supernatural notions <br>
     sometimes expressed here but whether one outweighs the other in <br>
     importance is up to the individual to decide.  Science and imagination <br>
     should be free to comingle and dance together to produce possibilities <br>
     to come.  I'll leave it to the moderators as to how to regulate a <br>
     balance that doesn't abruptly dismiss or matter-of-factly discredit.<br>
     <br>
