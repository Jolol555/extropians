As is our judiciary system:<br>
<p>
Excerpted from Rocky Mountain News...in part:<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Even before Republican Fife Symington was elected to his first term as</i><br>
Arizona governor, the leftwing Democrat cadre was gunning for him.  Some<br>
may recall erstwhile Senator Howard Metzenbaum summarily hauling<br>
Symington in front of a committee inquiry (which, unlike DNC<br>
investigations, WAS televised) for a quick coat of tar and feathers.  <br>
<p>
The people elected Symington in spite of the legitimized smear tactics -<br>
and after he lowered taxes, reduced government intrusion and still<br>
turned a Democrat deficit into a surplus budget, The People had the<br>
audacity to re-elect him ... and polls show we'd still do it again.  <br>
<p>
Desperation time for the Democrats.  So Janet Reno fired all the federal<br>
prosecutors and installed Ms. Napolitano (the counsel who was last seen<br>
whispering into Anita Hill's ear during the attempted lynching of<br>
Clarence Thomas) and she got together with the unions who OWN properties<br>
developed by Symington.  Oh, they didn't buy them.  They arranged for a<br>
pension fund mortgage, created union construction jobs and high enough<br>
costs to enable them to foreclose and take full possession.  But getting<br>
the property wasn't enough - they want to get Symington.  And despite<br>
the fact that a long list of charges have been heard and dismissed over<br>
the years, they kept coming back and proceeded with a jury trial.  <br>
<p>
Well, let's look more closely at that "jury" aspect.  Despite serioous<br>
scandals arising around hard core Democrat campaign agents who LIED to<br>
get onto the jury creating possible mistrial problems early on, Judge<br>
Roger Strand did the most extraordinary thing this week when the jury<br>
was NOT returning the arranged Guilty verdict.  He checked in to see who<br>
was most in favor of acquittal and summarily FIRED Mary Jane Cotey from<br>
the jury.  And then he imposed a GAG order on Cotey to prevent her from<br>
giving evidence in support of the MISTRIAL motion that ensued. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
Don't take it too seriously.<br>
