     The very real experience of people starving to death in Somalia, to <br>
     name another example, includes as causes the fact that some Somalians <br>
     with guns are starving other Somalians without guns, and the fact that <br>
     some Somalians don't consider fish to be people food, and will starve<br>
     rather than eat the unfamiliar stuff. Both of these are cultural; to<br>
     change them would require "cultural imperialism", which we are told is <br>
     a bad thing. Do cultures have rights, or do people?<br>

     I find this to be an interesting example because of its philosophical <br>
     implications (sucker for a good quandry). To the question, "Do <br>
     cultures have rights or do people?" I must ask, if people are <br>
     programmed to believe a certain thing and that is all they can <br>
     comprehend (without sufficient time and communication to change their <br>
     thinking) is their perception more important than their physical life? <br>
     Do we let a baby's hand stray toward a hot burner so that it can <br>
     assuredly learn the lesson of heat damage to human flesh?  Or do we <br>
     wish to protect the baby's hand from damage and moreover the child <br>
     from pain.  If our instinctual parenting directive is to protect <br>
     against lack of experience and knowledge where physical damage is a <br>
     certain and immediate result, should we not intervene with cultures <br>
     who have the same lacking?  Logically, would we not want a superior <br>
     off-world culture to intervene had an event like the Cold War <br>
     substantially heated up?<br>
     <br>
     I'm not a fervent believer in the Prime Directive as you can tell...<br>
