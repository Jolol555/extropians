I don't want to raise the heat in this conversation unecessarily, but in<br>
the interest of clarity I would want to reiterate that as far as I'm<br>
concerned every lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgendered person in the<br>
United States might properly be regarded as "under attack," and in<br>
consequence a lot of the behavior you seemed to decry as pandering for<br>
attention and jockeying for special privileges might just as easily seem<br>
on your own assumptions as perfectly justified cultural self-defense.  The<br>
fact that lesbians and gays are safe from the cruder brutalities of<br>
heterosexist laws and social prejudices only to the extent that they<br>
either manage to "pass" as straight in public or ghettoize themselves in<br>
nonhomophobic pockets of the sociocultural landscape (urban centers and<br>
particular employment niches), makes me especially nervous about the<br>
application to your figure of the ideally progressive queer of the<br>
adjective "unobtrusive".  For the record, as I said, I don't think gayness<br>
is remotely the most interesting thing about me, but neither do I think I<br>
manage to be particularly unobtrusive about it.  (Ask my students at<br>
Berkeley!)  I realize, btw, that I may have overstated the plight of<br>
queers somewhat, though I think probably I have not, and that things seem<br>
to be improving for us, etc., etc., but until equality is<br>
institutionalized in a satisfactory way I tend to notice and remember the<br>
shocking and surprisingly widespread vestigial remains of this stupidity<br>
rather than the fact that, e.g., Ellen came out to millions, lesbian chic<br>
has made it to a Newsweek cover, and gay people have their own bookstores<br>
in a handful of cities.  Just to nudge this conversation into a more<br>
conspicuously extropic register, I wonder to what extent the collision of<br>
proliferating forms of desire with traditional regimes of civility,<br>
legality, and morality we are seeing today presages conflicts to<br>
come as technoconstituted modifications of body and mind render race, sex,<br>
gender, and even species all quite as up-for-grabs as queers seem to have<br>
done already for institutions like love, family, and sex.  Best, Dale<br>
