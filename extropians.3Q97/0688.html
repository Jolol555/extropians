Almost certainly, they couldn't have spoken any human language, because their<br>
larynx was all wrong.  However, there are enough consonants and clicks you<br>
can form with your mouth alone to form a language, easily.  Human deaf-mutes<br>
develop fully functional language without using their mouths at all; *our*<br>
language centers are quite adept at making do.  So they could have had their<br>
own language, had their brains been set up for it (which we don't know).<br>

<p>
Or no language at all, or a language as complex as ours (although I'm<br>
inclined to doubt the last).  <br>
<p>
I agree that the Neanderthals probably lost due to inadequate culture; but<br>
why their culture was inadequate is a very open question.  Their bodies were<br>
clearly under less pressure than ours to speak well; our larynxes give us a<br>
substantial risk of choking from food.  Quite possibly their language centers<br>
weren't up to ours; that certainly would have prevented sophisticated<br>
communication even though their bodies didn't.<br>
<p>
There could have been non-linguistic reasons they didn't have a sophisticated<br>
culture.  Maybe different groups just didn't get along.  Maybe their<br>
intragroup confilects were too severe.  Maybe something else about their<br>
brains was different.  Maybe they didn't have elders (how long did they live,<br>
anyway?)<br>
<p>
Interesting, they could learn from us, to some extent.  They have found one<br>
Neanderthal burial site.  Normally burial was a human custom; before this<br>
they didn't think Neanderthals ever buried their dead.  The speculation is<br>
that they learned it from humans.  I believe there were even flowers in the<br>
grave (well, they found pollen, to be precise).  Would that count as art?<br>
