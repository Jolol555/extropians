Yeah, and look where he ended up :-)<br>
     <br>

<p>
I addressed this in some other post here recently.  The way space and time<br>
are defined in our universe; no, it's not even meaningful to travel faster<br>
than light or to get somewhere (or pass information) FTL.  Relativity creates<br>
a whole barrel of nasty paradoxes and then discreetly covers them with the<br>
light-speed-limit veil.  FTL seems "possible" to us because we don't think in<br>
terms of relativity.<br>
<p>
As a loose example, I always wondered why black hole boundaries are absolute.<br>
 After all, if you're just barely outside of the event horizon couldn't you<br>
see a light ray peeking up from just inside?  Then I saw and interesting<br>
article in Scientific American on the behaviour of light and centrifugal<br>
force near a black hole.  Now I understand why you can't see through a black<br>
hole's event horizon, from any distance (and boy, those mothers are even<br>
creepier than I thought).  <br>
<p>
Anyway, my points is that once you better understand these things, the<br>
physics way makes more sense.  If you really want to understand more, get a<br>
good book on relativity with some "paradoxes" in it.  Think about what<br>
happens when you have multiple observers, in various places and with various<br>
speeds.  After a while you get a little bit of a handle with how space, time,<br>
and motion fit together in this odd universe of ours and notions of FTL<br>
travel/communication start making a lot less sense.<br>
