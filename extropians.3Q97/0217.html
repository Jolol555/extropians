In a message dated 97-07-08 16:36:46 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  our minds could already be a collective of many independent<br>
 conscious beings &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Two books to reference :  Marvin Minsky's "Society of Mind" and another<br>
 (whose title and authori can't remember exactly) but it's something vaugely<br>
similar to "The advent of consciousness and the breakdown of the Bicameral<br>
Mind"<br>
<p>
Key Concept: Memes (memes=information virus running on biological computer)<br>
<p>
Everyone is uncouncious about a third of their life (sleep), plus they<br>
operate on "auto-pilot" a fair amount of the time. (How often are you trully f<br>
ocused on what you are doing? Only when engaged in creative endeavor I<br>
suspect.  Problems solving)<br>
<p>
Minsky writes that our mind is comprised of a vast multitude of "programs"<br>
running both simultaneously and sequencially.<br>
<p>
The author of the books whose title I mangled asserts that mankind as a group<br>
was not "counscious" until  one of the early civilizations (Asyrians?...The<br>
dudes with the clay tablets)  He furthur asserts that there were some<br>
holdouts until rather recently...(how else could Pizzarro and just a few<br>
buddies effectively stomp and entire civilization...I mean we Texans did<br>
pretty good at the Alamo but get REAL!)....The conquistadors were "conscious"<br>
the Aztects (as a whole) were not.<br>
<p>
Now suppose that consciousness is a meme.  And suppose that there are<br>
different flavors...like the flu....(are you more conscious than Bubba?  Is<br>
Bubba even conscious at all? Is Bubba even awake?)<br>
<p>
That being stipulated...wouldn't it require a language to transmit<br>
"consciousness"...or at least some type of meme vector....(TV transmits<br>
stupidy...is this to much of a stretch?)<br>
