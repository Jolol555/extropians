<i>&gt; The social vs. practical comparison answers a question about politics:</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;From Celia Green, "The Human Evasion": </i><br>
<p>
  "Society begins to appear much less unreasonable when one realizes its true<br>
function. It is there to help everyone to keep their minds off reality. This<br>
follows automatically from the fact that it is an association of sane people,<br>
and it has already been shown that sanity arises from the continual insertion<br>
of `other people' into any space into which a metaphysical problem might<br>
intrude."<br>
<p>
  "It is therefore quite irrelevant to criticize society as though it were<br>
there for some other purpsoe - to keep everyone alive and well-fed in an<br>
efficient manner, say. Some degree of inefficiency is essential to create<br>
interesting opportunities for emotional reaction. (Of course, criticizing<br>
society, though irrelevant, is undeniably of value as an emotional<br>
distraction for sane people.)"<br>
<p>
[snips]<br>
<p>
  "To the sane mind, even aggression against people is infinitely better than<br>
aggression against infinity. And it is the chief defect of sane society that<br>
it is boring. It is so boring that even sane people notice it. And so, from<br>
time to time, there is a war. This is intended to divert people's minds before<br>
they become so bored that they take to some impersonal kind of aggressive<br>
activity - such as rseearch, or asceticism, or inspiration, or something<br>
discreditable of that kind."<br>
<p>
  "In wartime, rather more purposeful activity than usual is permissible. Even<br>
sane people relax their normal beliefs that nothing matters very much, and<br>
some time next week is soon enough for anything. This is regarded as justified<br>
because the war is always about something connected with *other people*, and<br>
may be regarded as an assertion of the belief that *the thing that matters<br>
most is politics*."<br>
<p>
[snips]<br>
<p>
  "Society, they say, exists to safeguard the rights of the individual. If this<br>
is so, the primary right of a human being is evidently to live<br>
unrealistically."<br>
<p>
[snips]<br>
<p>
  "Sane people regard an apparently purposeful activity as disinfected by<br>
numbers - i.e. if a sufficiently large number of people is involved, they feel<br>
sure that they outcome will be harmless to sanity, no matter how frenzied the<br>
labours may seem to be. The most large-scale examples are war and politics.<br>
Into these activities, people allow themselves to enter with almost single-<br>
minded devotion."<br>
<p>
  "Both war and politics have played a particularly helpful part in retarding<br>
the march of progress. In fact, the history of the human race is only<br>
comprehensible as the record of a species trying ont to gain control of its<br>
environment."<br>
<p>
It's an amusing book, though it seems to be out of print. The full text<br>
is on the Web somewhere (try a search engine).<br>
