I wish I had kept at least a few notes (especially people's names). This is <br>
a possible reconstruction of part of my personal perspective, leaving out most of<br>
the talks, which should be covered elsewhere. Maybe some of the people<br>
mentioned below could email me and jog my memory. I'd really appreciate it.<br>
<p>
--A personal odyssey at EXTRO 3--<br>
<p>
Friday 2 PM<br>
Checking in- I think that is Anders behind me, too shy to ask.<br>
<p>
Spot E. Shaun, talk for a couple hours, show him the "blah blah<br>
EXTRO 3 blah blah" method of sampling passersby.<br>
<p>
Nap until 5:30. Searching for Kathryn Aegis- didn't find her that evening.<br>
<p>
That _is_  Anders, he brings three Swedes with him (obviously a persuasive guy).<br>
<p>
We have dinner- me, Anders &amp; delegation, E. Shaun, &amp;?<br>
<p>
Small party in Max's room. Called up and got Tanya Jones on the phone, so<br>
nice to speak with her I forgot the room number. Went up to the right floor, where<br>
Ralph Merkle's ever-pleasant voice guided us  in. Met Paul Wakfer, Daniel Bennett (?),<br>
Bradbury, Denise (Sasha's friend), &amp;?<br>
===============================================<br>
Saturday-<br>
<p>
Welcoming speech,<br>
<p>
Met Fred and Linda Chamberlain (Alcor booth). Will probably opt for this organization.<br>
<p>
Lunch with Ralph Merkle, Eric Drexler, Kennita Watson, Carl Feynman, &amp;?<br>
Anders' name came up, Drexler was pleased to hear Anders was in town and hoped to <br>
meet him.<br>
Ralph Merkle tells me my paper is accepted (or at least not rejected) for the upcoming <br>
Fifth Foresight Convention. He is pleased that over 100 abstracts were submitted.<br>
<p>
Dinner with Darren Reynolds, Kathryn Aegis,<br>
<p>
Met Ping, urged him to go forth and make millions, return to academia later.<br>
<p>
Danced with Romana "Maximum Babe" Machado, learned she's married (sigh).<br>
Her new ciphered laptop video hack sounds interesting (64 bit RSA, fresh off the shelf<br>
circuitry). Left her having a good time with Kathryn.<br>
Met (SOHO) girl. Took her to meet Carl Feynman, no luck.<br>
Conversations with Mitch Porter,<br>
Swedes, &amp;?<br>
<p>
===============================================<br>
Sunday-<br>
Breakfast with Max More, I think he would have preferred some quiet time.<br>
<p>
Said hi to Marvin Minsky, gave him IRTS paper saying "show me the disappearing trick",<br>
which he did (the pockets on MM's vest can easily swallow a laptop).<br>
<p>
Lunch with Eric Drexler, Sasha, Chris Peterson, Ralph Merkle, &amp;?<br>
Asked Eric if he'd heard the term "Drextech", which apparently he hadn't. He didn't<br>
appear to be too enthusiastic about it. Spoke of Rick Smalley and Eugene Leitl's<br>
objections (which he does not share), agreed it will be interesting to hear Smalley's<br>
keynote talk at the Fifth Foresight Convention.<br>
Interesting talk with Sasha on the (non) continuity of post-Singularity humanity.<br>
<p>
Talk with Carl Feynman on methods of blowing up the Sun.<br>
<p>
End-<br>
Met Keith Henson, Nick Szabo (very briefly), Lee Daniel Crocker, &amp;?<br>
Trade in my "To infinity and beyond" button (I don't believe in infinities outside<br>
mathematics) for Anders' "The sum of all human knowledge would be nice, <br>
but I want more".<br>
<p>
Christopher Heward (of all people) found me smoking a cigarette while waiting for <br>
a shuttle, we both agreed I'm an idiot-child. Argued about the need for nanotech to <br>
achieve closure of self-replicating manufacturing systems. Bradbury on same flight, <br>
might have lunch sometime (he's off to Australia this week). Maybe I'll help with <br>
the engineering of the Dyson Sphere Brain (it needs work).<br>
===================================<br>
Highlights:<br>
<p>
Anders expresses a desire to become an open standard.<br>
Ping demonstrates site evaluation webware.<br>
Marvin Minsky and Eric Drexler get Alcor bracelets after years of<br>
prodding from friends.<br>
<p>
And above all:<br>
We meet.<br>
