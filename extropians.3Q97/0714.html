The pivot point acts as the connection point between a fixed and multiple<br>
free-moving members, not really a pendulum in the classical analysis sense. <br>
<p>
If it were a simple pendulum problem, it would not be possible for a person<br>
to start from rest.<br>
<p>
The force that you have forgotten is the tension in the rope.  Analysis as<br>
a classical pendulum generally excludes this force because 1) it is in<br>
equilibrium, and 2) it is contained in a single member.  When the swinger<br>
pulls on the rope at some point between the seat and the pivot, the x-axis<br>
component of the tension is modified, evidenced by the sudden bend in the<br>
rope around the point where the hands are attached (at which point the rope<br>
should be analyzed as *two* individual free-moving members around an<br>
additional pivot point).  Because one point is fixed (the pivot) and the<br>
other point is not (the seat), there is a net change in force around the<br>
second pivot point (the hands).  In other words, the swinger is actually<br>
pulling themselves towards the pivot point, and the unbalanced x-axis<br>
component of this applied force is manifested as acceleration.  This is why<br>
where you hold the rope makes a difference in how fast you gain speed.  <br>
<p>
This problem is really a classical multi-member statics (or dynamics<br>
depending on your analysis technique) problem.<br>
