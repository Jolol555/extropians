<p>
This is an excellent point.  Estimates of the odds are almost a self-<br>
fulfilling prophecy; if everyone on the planet thinks, "yeah, sure, and<br>
pigs might fly!" then cryonics would get resource-starved and its odds of<br>
political and technological success go to nil. If everyone on the planet<br>
thinks, "whoop de do, we CAN live forever!", we'd see early revivals within <br>
the millenium. Compared with a moon landing, cryonics is not exactly rocket<br>
science :-)<br>
<p>
And then there's the plausibility of Everett's multi-worlds interpretation<br>
of QM; if there's any chance that cryonics might work for you, then, Everett<br>
being on the mark, a plethora of you will make it. Why should you care<br>
if you don't survive in a millionty-billionty other universes, so long as you're fat and happy in this one? <br>
<p>
Any odds are better than sods.<br>

Subject: Estimating the probability of success of cryonics<br>

<p>
I tried to post this a few days ago, but it seems not to have made it.<br>
-----------------------------<br>
<p>
Periodically, someone posts an analysis of the form<br>
<p>
Probability of success =<br>
<p>
    probability of event 1 x<br>
    probability of event 2 x<br>
        .<br>
        .<br>
        .<br>
    probability of event n<br>
<p>
While this approach is entirely reasonable in the abstract, it<br>
is only valid when the different events are independent.  Usually,<br>
however, the events listed are correlated in various ways, resulting<br>
in a serious error in the overall estimate.<br>
<p>
For example, if two events are:<br>
<p>
      government allows revival<br>
and<br>
      not put in zoo<br>
<p>
we see that there is a likely correlation.  If, for example, after the<br>
successful revival of people in cryonic suspension the Supreme Court<br>
rules that they have the same rights they had prior to suspension,<br>
then the government would be more likely to block attempts to put<br>
you in a zoo.<br>
<p>
Similarly, the items<br>
<p>
      will awake without dire pain<br>
and<br>
      my cryonics organization is willing to revive me<br>
<p>
are also correlated.  If there is a significant probability of waking<br>
in dire pain, the cryonics organization will likely conclude that<br>
further research is required and that those in suspension should not be<br>
revived until the problem of dire pain is solved.<br>
<p>
My experience is that lists with more than three or four items suffer<br>
from severe correlations, which invalidates the simple multiplicative<br>
estimate of the total probability of success.<br>
<p>
In general, cryonics will fail only if:<br>
<p>
1)  Information theoretic death occurs at some point in time<br>
2)  Technologies that are feasible in principle are never applied<br>
    in practice.<br>
<p>
In addition, it is theoretically possible that cryonics could be a<br>
technical success but would still be undesired if, on waking, you<br>
found that being dead was preferable to being alive.  We could<br>
therefore add a third item:<br>
<p>
3)  I don't like the result.<br>
<p>
Even this short list suffers from correlations.  For example,<br>
unsatisfactory results (item 3) could be caused by failure to<br>
apply appropriate methods (item 2).<br>

<i>&gt;briefly explain how it works?</i><br>
<p>
Some lower animals, like the Antarctic nematode, can be frozen to liquid<br>
nitrogen temperatures, rewarmed, and go about their business just fine. <br>
But these animals are particularly adapted to the cold.  No mammal has been<br>
frozen and revived; we don't have the technology today to repair freezing<br>
damage.<br>
<p>
This is not a test of whether cryonics works, of course.  Cryonics works if<br>
the patient's condition is stabilized in a state that *future* technology<br>
can repair.  Tests of this are currently underway -- check back again in<br>
100 years or so to see how these tests come out!<br>
<p>
There is much cause for optimism, though: humans and other animals have<br>
been successfully cooled to near-freezing temperatures, their blood washed<br>
out and replaced with a perfusate solution, and restored to normal life and<br>
health (do lit searches on "deep hypothermic surgery").  And the freezing<br>
procedures used appear to preserve brain structures in good order, which is<br>
what would be required (at a minimum) for successful repair.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, what's the difference between cryonics and cryogenics.</i><br>
<p>
"Cryogenics" is an incorrect term for cryonics which is often used by the<br>
media to let you know that they really haven't done any research into the<br>
topic at all.  The same applies to laypeople as well, of course -- if<br>
someone tells you they're convinced cryogenics can't work, then you can<br>
tell immediately that they actually know nothing about it.  Rather<br>
convenient, really...<br>
