[I've been without easy email access for a long time, and and have<br>
missed a lot of interesting threads.  Let's see how much I can do in<br>

Steve Witham responded:<br>
<i>&gt;Right.  But the social signal may be mainly about desire to argue! ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;What I'm saying is that there are other purposes for non-practical</i><br>

<p>
I was looking for explanations which could plausibly be given<br>
evolutionary foundations.  I don't see the evolutionary function of<br>
just wanting to argue for argument's sake. <br>
