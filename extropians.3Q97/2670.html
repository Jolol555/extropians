<i>&gt; "Red goo" is not an acceptable alternate to "black goo" because nobody can</i><br>

<p>
Huh? I see no problems at all with this term. In our culture red is often<br>
associated with aggression and danger, and red goo makes sense. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Khaki goo" is just plain silly.</i><br>
<p>
Why? It might not be a deadly serious term, but it suggests something that<br>
has come out of a military lab and used by the traditional (IMHO soon to<br>
be very outdated) armies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  "War goo", abandoning the spectrum, is acceptable; as is "death goo".</i><br>
<p>
War goo is an useful term, since it tells what is intended, but death goo<br>
is a bit too diffuse: does it mean death to a certain person (like the <br>
"quicksilver" I wrote a short story about), all people who are in contact <br>
with it or all ordered systems? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  "Mataglap" would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be fine, since it's easy to translate into Something Evil.  Except that in</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Aristoi", the term was synonymous with any destructive goo, so we'd be</i><br>
<i>&gt; changing the terminology.</i><br>
<p>
I have added Mataglap to my terminology pages since it is an interesting<br>
term, but it is too vague to be very useful. It has the connotations of Evil,<br>
which is impractical in serious discussions about goo capabilities since<br>
we are more interested in the tactical or long-term aspects, not whether<br>
the nanites themselves have some metaphysical evil (one could argue that<br>
gray, red, khaki and green goo are all evils, but the nanites themselves<br>
are just tools for somebody to comitt evil).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; "Black goo" is instantly recognizable as Malevolent Goo.</i><br>
<p>
Yes. I don't think it is specific enough to be useful, but it is recognizble.<br>
The problem is that it encompasses accidental goo, deliberately designed<br>
malevolent goo and Ubergoo built by Powers that look malevolent but really<br>
isn't (see the story _Kadath in the Cold Waste_ for a fine take on it<br>
(forgot the author, but make a web search for Kadath and Mars, and you<br>
will likely find it)). <br>
