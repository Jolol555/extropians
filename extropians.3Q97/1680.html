----------<br>
In response to Philip Witham's writings<br>
<p>
Well put! I agree with just about everything, so I snipped it to save<br>
bandwidth(or is this bull?) It would be great to make a new nation<br>
that's based on transhumanistic ideas, the advantages would be enormous.<br>
The sooner, the better! [see also "An Extropian Nation??!",<br>
posted on 6/18/'97] <br>
<p>
Some minor points of criticism:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Few or no fixed points to the constitution, all is up for change by </i><br>
<i>&gt; direct voting of citizens: anything else implys that a few "founders" </i><br>
<i>&gt; have the right to more control than everybody else.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
If this is acceptable to newcomers, why not? A society is a bit like a<br>
private club, and it would be only natural that the founders (by definition<br>
above-average people) have the right to determine the rules, or at least<br>
have the final word in decision making. If someone finds this unacceptable,<br>
he simply finds himself another club, or starts his own.<br>
<p>
Having said this, I must quickly add that I agree that in fact generally<br>
accepted values should rule instead of people. Maybe computers, programmed<br>
with these values, specified in laws, should do most<br>
of the everyday governing, especially where judicial matters are concerned.<br>
The advantages are enormous (consequent, unbiased,<br>
cheap etc). The (immortal!) "founding fathers" could be part of a<br>
"constitutional committee" (supreme court?) which monitors the<br>
computers and society in general to make sure that at least the core<br>
values of that society (as agreed upon by all) are not corrupted (for ex<br>
by infiltrators of rival societies, who in theory at least could out-vote<br>
the "honest" inhabitants and thus democratically and legally destroy<br>
the new nation. Think Germany, 30's...) <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Jointly writing such a constitution would be a fun project - off line</i><br>
from<br>
<i>&gt; this group (about as much fun as a massive blood clot, if done on this </i><br>
<i>&gt; mailing list).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Sounds like a good start! :)<br>
