And the default (not always adhered to) for the Arab and Chinese<br>

not the pluralism found in ancient Greece and early modern<br>
Europe.<br>

I have a book called "A History of the African Peoples" that<br>
might be what you're looking for. I don't recall the author's<br>
name. It does cover some of the earlier civilizations, though as<br>
I recall it's a little weak on the old Zimbabwean cultures<br>
because it was written before a lot of the fruitful digs in that<br>
area were analyzed.<br>
