     Watch out for anyone who feels that they have to hold their "seminars"<br>
     (see: sales pitch) offshore.<br>
     Do not give them any money until you have all the facts from several<br>
     reliable independent sources.<br>
     If I were you I'd find out where they are incorporated, check their <br>
     D&amp;B rating, check with the SEC and the State Attorney General's <br>
     securities bureau in whatever state they are making their initial <br>
     offering in. Check with the FTC and the BBB.<br>
     <br>
     Beware of multi-level distributorships and get-rich-quick schemes. <br>
     Beware of franchises and dealerships. The only one who usually makes <br>
     any real money in these schemes is the original promoter.<br>
     <br>
     IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT IS USUALLY A SCAM.<br>

     <br>
     Thanks for the caution and I'd say there was a good chance I won't be <br>
     rushing into anything half-cocked.  I'm pretty cautious about money <br>
     for some reason.<br>
     <br>
     However, I want to point out that it's all the monetary systems set up <br>
     in place that keep the status quo thriving and I'm not sure I like <br>
     that.  I'm not sure all the governmental controls set up to protect me <br>
     aren't just there to keep me docile and uninformed.  I'm not sure in <br>
     this age of information, where INFORMATION itself is the most viable <br>
     commodity on the planet, if one can't use information *about* money to <br>
     make money.  I'm not sure I can go on another year or two being a <br>
     corporate zombie, hating my commute, feeling unexpressed as a human, <br>
     feeling anxious about how much I'll have saved for "retirement".<br>
     <br>
     I have been "programmed" with the meme that if it's too good to be <br>
     true, it's usually a scam.  These days, I'm not so sure...or perhaps I <br>
     should be all the more assured that scams are even more elusive and <br>
     clever.  <br>
     <br>
     Anyway, thanks for your counsel.  I continue to look for experiential <br>
     data about this particular organization so I can make an informed <br>
     choice.  Right now, I know I want OUT of the normalcy but I still have <br>
     to play the economic game.<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
