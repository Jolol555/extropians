<i>&gt; Lee Daniel Crocker:  Evolution is not "kind" or "unkind"; it is </i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing more than a mathematical consequence of a certain set of initial </i><br>
<i>&gt; conditions: replication, mutation, competition.  Far better to understand </i><br>
<i>&gt; and make use of an existing effect than to try to fight it.  You might as </i><br>
<i>&gt; well try fighting pi.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Me: What a defeatist attitude for an extropian.  Fuck Pi!  If I have </i><br>
<i>&gt; to struggle for billions of years with String Theory or wormhole physics </i><br>
<i>&gt; to beat pi, I will!</i><br>

Interesting idea, but not very useful.  It takes /more/ creativity and<br>
imagination to work within (self-imposed) constraints than to merely<br>
speculate wildly.  Anybody can imagine magic; the hard part is to<br>
imagine magic that actually plays by the rules as you know them and<br>
then make it happen.<br>
<p>
Ignoring the present reality--or even for a moment forgetting its<br>
constraints--can lead to disaster.  Take, for example, the present<br>
reality that men and women are physiologically and psychologically<br>
different from the moment of birth.  That's a constraint many of us<br>
would like to get rid of, and one we might very well be able to get<br>
rid of with higher technology.  We all want freedom of choice, and<br>
egalitarian ethics; but assuming we're there already is bad.<br>
<p>
In the 70s, about 50 infant boys who suffered botched circumcisions<br>
(and don't get me started about that barbaric nonsense) underwent<br>
gender "reassignment" upon the advice of their doctors, who believed,<br>
despite evidence to the contrary, that if the boys had surgery to<br>
create a semblance of female genitalia, and were raised and socialized<br>
as girls, that they would become normal girls.  The result was<br>
predictable: hand the "girl" a doll, and he makes it a soldier; come<br>
adolescence, nearly all of them chose to re-socialize as males<br>
despite their lack of equipment, and most spent years in therapy.<br>
<p>
A few doctors put their egalitarian dream ahead of their scientific<br>
integrity, and 50 boys were physically mutilated and psychologically<br>
damamged.  Dream of the future all you want, but /act/ on reality.<br>
