<i>&gt;No, it's going to be anything but weird.  Where we are today, our present</i><br>

<i>&gt;You were born free, your imagination wondered about the infinite</i><br>

<i>&gt;reality, a reality that didn't play by your rules. ...</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps I've played too much D&amp;D in my lifetime, but I haven't been able<br>
to think of a wish to ask of my wish machine that wouldn't backfire and<br>
still would handle the problem of rapists, megalomaniacs, homicidal and<br>
genocidal maniacs, religious fanatics, etc. (think of the wishes such people<br>
might make, and realize that you might not have much time to make yours,<br>
since you definitely don't want theirs to get implemented first).<br>
<p>
Most wishes I rejected out of hand (for example, "Enforce the non-aggression<br>
principle" with " -- for humans." added in as a quick afterthought so I<br>
don't screw with miscellaneous ecosystems too much -- requires a very<br>
person-specific idea of what constitutes a threat; "Perfect psychology."<br>
seems even more dangerous -- as I recall, Eli doesn't _like_ what some<br>
people consider an improved psychology).  I'm still evaluating "Make me both<br>
completely free and completely safe." -- I added in the "free" part to keep<br>
from being put in a person-sized, nuclear-hardened, climate-controlled<br>
Habitrail.<br>
<p>
No wonder I prefer to keep most of my thoughts about the far future<br>
general and positive until I have a bigger brain with which to figure out<br>
how to handle it!<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
