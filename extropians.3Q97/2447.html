     My position is that it's none of my business what someone else <br>
     does...with his dog..his property...or his children...however <br>
     reprehensible or noble it may be...as long as I have no <br>
     responsibility...am not damaged....then I have no authority..and would <br>
     be well advised to mind my own business.<br>

     One quickly advances into ethical discussions as to the point where <br>
     one decides it necessary to intervene in morally-offensive or <br>
     life-threatening situations.  If you see your neighbor abusing his <br>
     dog, do you call the SPCA?  If you hear domestic violence in the house <br>
     regularly, do you call the police?  If you see your neighbor behaving <br>
     like a voyeur peering out the window with telescope at a neighboring <br>
     window, do you inform the neighbor they are being spied upon?  If you <br>
     see your neighbor dumping waste oil down the gutter, do you alert <br>
     environmental authorities?  If you know your neighbor's stealing cable <br>
     tv access, do you call the company and report it?<br>
     <br>
     Everyone has a different line they draw.  Any of the situations above <br>
     seem intolerable to me but all would dirive a different reaction for <br>
     me based upon the dynamics of the relationship I had with the <br>
     neighbor, my own sense of safety, etc.. They're not black and white <br>
     for me though they are all essentially ethically inappropriate.<br>
     <br>
     Until the point where humans in a civilized capacity become <br>
     accountable for their own actions individually, I have to accept some <br>
     ownership of our actions by governmental authorities.  Perhaps the <br>
     discussion should be shifted from the questions of involvement and <br>
     ownership to how to we embue accountability on the masses?  <br>
     <br>
     Brain experts, is there an "accountability center" we can regulate? <br>
     (presuming we can agree on what constitutes accountability &lt;G&gt;).<br>
     <br>
