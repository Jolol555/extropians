Question:  Why don't more operating systems come with built in programming<br>
languages and compilers?<br>
<p>
Note to Unix users: Yes it is great!<br>
<p>
Most modern operating systems don't come with a built in programming language<br>
and compiler, gone are the days when all computers had a BASIC prompt<br>
(memories!).  This is probably because today's OS is meant to be simple and<br>
user friendly.  But I think users have a right to create their own software<br>
without having to buy any expensive compilers, etc.<br>
<p>
When I buy a car, I can pull it apart, make modifications and remove parts to<br>
put in other cars.  Yet when I buy software all I can do is what the software<br>
allows me to do.  I can't see how it works, I can't super charge it and I<br>
can't change the colour.<br>
<p>
Here's my idea: Build an object oriented visual operating system (not a<br>
operating system with a GUI strapped on but a visual software environment).<br>
 Create a simple object system that allows all objects to inherit simple<br>
properties with zero programming (If it's not attached you can move it).<br>
 Include tools for editing text and objects (all tools can edit all documents<br>
and objects, no more applications).  Users can build (rather than program)<br>
there own tools or they can buy third party-tools.  When they buy third-party<br>
tools they're allowed unrestricted access to modify them how they like (by<br>
sub-classing, so they don't have to see the precious code).<br>
<p>
Now, you could say this is the way operating systems are going, or even the<br>
way they are (if you buy the right applications).  But I think the ability to<br>
create should be built into operating systems at the lowest possible level.<br>
 We need software environments where we can manipulate and create objects<br>
directly rather than using bulky applications.<br>
<p>
This has a deeper meaning than just allowing anyone to create software (and<br>
thus insuring a healthy supply of programmers).  It is also important for the<br>
future of computing and the _death of the software industry_ (cue Jaws<br>
music)…<br>
<p>
As computers progress, they will reach a point where we &lt;gasp&gt; no longer need<br>
to buy software (or download it from the net).  Instead, you the user will<br>
program your own computer via voice recognition/understanding and, through<br>
Artificial Intelligence your computer will program itself.  No software<br>
applications, just a pool of reusable components and agents that are clipped<br>
together as you speak.  To get to this wonderful utopian freeware future we<br>
need to point ourselves in the right direction…<br>
<p>
--Wax<br>
<p>
P.S. Okay I'll admit it I'm using Windows, yeah I'm a hypocrite, could<br>
someone point me in the direction of freeware land... I seem to be lost!<br>
