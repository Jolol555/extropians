<p>
I think of it this way:  How many levels of government do we a priori need? <br>
One nation-level government to handle things like military defense, and one<br>
city-level government to handle things like local jails or whatever.  I would<br>
seriously question the necessity for a city government at all, in fact.  Once<br>
a national government has secured the basic rights of freedom from force and<br>
fraud, a city government can serve only to poke its nose into things that<br>
should rightfully be private concerns - such as street repair, firefighting,<br>
zoning commissions...<br>
<p>
That being the case, I can't see why we need an intermediate level of<br>
government.  Perhaps it could act as a "city" government for small towns, too<br>
small to have their own jails... or perhaps not.<br>
<p>
The only real reason for the existence of states is to provide a multitude of<br>
small experimental cultures, large enough to produce interesting results,<br>
small enough that we can have 50 political incubators.  Even so, the<br>
Internet should allow the coordination of numbers of like-minded cities to<br>
form their own experiments.  Defining an arbitrary geographical entity doesn't<br>
change the amount of innovation; it allows bad innovations to be enforced and<br>
prevents good ones from spreading.<br>
<p>
Even given the best of reasons for a "state" government, the "states" should<br>
not be geographically organized - and cities should be free to belong to the<br>
"state" of their choice, or none at all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's entirely possible that these sorts of structures are far beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt; human engineering skill, and that the US Constitution was partly</i><br>
<i>&gt; a result of careful study of structures that had emerged and grown</i><br>
<i>&gt; without being designed, and partly itself a lucky accident.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; is why I'd favor a loose confederation of nearly independent states,</i><br>
<i>&gt; who can experiment with a variety of different constitutional</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems without risking screwing up their neighbors societies too</i><br>
<i>&gt; much. Different strokes for different folks, doncha know.</i><br>
<p>
That's why I would be against a Constitutional Convention.  One should write a<br>
prospective Constitution in advance, and then - if it is approved - vote it<br>
into existence in one fell swoop, without allowing amendment until after it<br>
exists.  Otherwise, it will be loaded down with well-meaning but harmful<br>
addendums, and created with too much opportunity for private tinkering.<br>
<p>
In response to your assertion that such structures are beyond human skill, I<br>
would rather propose that there are numerous psychological forces acting to<br>
screw our designs.  The Constitution succeeded because - through a fluke of<br>
luck or otherwise - these forces were barred from acting.  Given that there<br>
will be no Constitutional Convention, we can simply attempt to do the same<br>
thing ourselves, armed with a much fuller knowledge of things like<br>
evolutionary psychology, and a high technology which greatly expands the<br>
sphere of alternatives.<br>
<p>
If we fail, we can junk the inferior document and stick with the current<br>
Constitution.  If we fail and don't realize it, we won't add anything new to<br>
the situation over and above all the other groups calling for a new<br>
Constitution.  Only calling a Constitutional Convention would force us to go<br>
with the best we mere humans could do.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I dispute the implicit idea that the current Constitution is working. <br>
It isn't; it's breaking down.  Not just the amendments; although the<br>
Constitution continues to operate perfectly against tyrants, other menaces<br>
such as bureaucracy and paperwork are threatening to choke the country, and<br>
might very well do just that, if continued unchecked.  *Something* needs to be<br>
slapped into place, and I have no faith in stopgap measures to do it - like<br>
putting a band-aid on an axe wound.  Congress, in the past, has simply ignored<br>
legislated limits to spending.  So we need to redesign Congress, spending, or<br>
taxation - at the very least.  I propose streamlinking(*) all three to get<br>
rid of the accumulated junk.  Streamlinking is often useful when social<br>
organizations begin to malfunction; a very powerful tool which usually<br>
requires immense computing power and high-speed communications.<br>
