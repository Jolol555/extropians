        Basic objectivism is great as a core value to any individual...in<br>
addition, I agree with everything Perry said about having no obligations to<br>
anyone but himself.  However, a lot of Rand's more "advanced" thoughts on<br>
objectivism tend to look rather narrow-minded and restricted: this is where<br>
the 'human' part fits in.  If one values basic objectivist core values,<br>
there is a tremendous amount of potential for human growth *on top* of<br>
those values.  As long as one can freely acknowledge his reasons for doing<br>
things and the fact that he has *no* limitations or obligations except<br>
those he wishes to adhere to, there is no end of fertile ground --emotional<br>
or moral-- to build upon.  That is why a lot of people began to live<br>
extropian lifestyles...it is a logical outcome to want to culminate our<br>
potential as individuals and as a society; without this objectivist core,<br>
I'm sure that many of us wouldn't be talking on such a list.<br>
