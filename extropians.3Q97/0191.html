I just watched "Man Immortal" on TLC and I must say that despite the <br>
title of their program, their conclusions were disappointing. Something <br>
to the effect of: "Though man may die, mankind will live forever" and <br>
sap like that.<br>
<p>
They put the viewer on a bit of a roller-coaster ride with segments <br>
about some new research or discovery with fantastic potential, then <br>
tempering our enthusiasm with the downside (example: we might be able to <br>
change our "clock" genes but the free radicals will get us anyway).<br>
<p>
They ended off with finding a way to make our cells renew themselves <br>
indefinately so as to avoid free radical damage. Though they suggest <br>
this is possible, apparently the cell reproduction goes out of control, <br>
inevitably leading to cancer. And then you die.<br>
<p>
I don't follow their logic however: If the point of cell renewal is to <br>
replace damaged cells, and our red blood cells (for instance) can do <br>
this more rapidly than cells in other parts of our body, why couldn't we <br>
make these other cells work at least as well (once we find the way to <br>
reprogram them) and keep their reproduction stable as that of the red <br>
blood cells?<br>
