<p>
I think the problem is with "and continue to be so".  The two may be the<br>
same at the instant of copying, but as soon as they are in different<br>
locations, they begin to have different inputs, so their thoughts begin<br>
to diverge.  With no inputs, the thoughts might be the same (though<br>
discussions a ways back about quantum uncertainty leave the matter open<br>
in my mind), but as soon as they look at the lines in the ceiling from<br>
different angles, and from one's point of view they come together at<br>
angles reminiscent of those of a boat, and from the other's at angles<br>
reminiscent of those of a sawhorse, they are off thinking about different<br>
things and cease to be identical.<br>
<p>
They can't know each other's thoughts, because A probably can't imagine<br>
what the ceiling looks like from B's point of view, and vice versa, and<br>
even if they could, it would be imagining, not seeing, which uses<br>
different neural pathways.  I'm not sure how quick the divergence would<br>
be, but I think it would be nonzero in short order.<br>
