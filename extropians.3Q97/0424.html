We discussed the Doomsday argument briefly on this list about<br>
half a year ago, but didn't reach a definite conclusion. Considering<br>
that it is a potential refutation of the core of the transhumanist<br>
world-view, I think it is pertinent to bring it up again. --Here<br>
is a quick recapitulation:<br>
<p>
The Doomsday argument was conceived by the astrophysicist<br>
Brandon Carter some fifteen years ago, and it has since been<br>
developed in a Nature article by Richard Gott [1993], and in<br>
several papers by philosopher John Leslie and especially in his<br>
recent monograph The End of The World (Leslie [1996]). The core <br>
idea is this. Imagine that two big urns are put in front<br>
of you, and you know that one of them contains ten balls and<br>
the other a million, but you are ignorant as to which is which.<br>
You know the balls in each urn are numbered 1, 2, 3, . N. Now you<br>
take a ball at random from the left urn, and it is number 7.<br>
Clearly, this is a strong indication that that urn contains only<br>
ten balls. If originally the odds were fifty-fifty, a swift<br>
application of Bayes' theorem gives you the posterior probability<br>
that the left urn is the one with only ten balls.<br>
(Pposterior (L=10) = 0.999990). But now consider the case where<br>
instead of the urns you have two possible human races, and<br>
instead of balls you have individuals, ranked according to birth<br>
order. As a matter of fact, you happen to find that your rank<br>
is about sixty billion. Now, says Carter and Leslie, we should<br>
reason in the same way as we did with the urns. That you should<br>
have a rank of sixty billion or so is much more likely is<br>
only 100 billion persons will ever have lived than if there will be<br>
many trillion persons. Therefore, by Bayes' theorem, you should<br>
update your beliefs about mankind's prospects and realise that<br>
an impending doomsday is much more probable than you have<br>
hitherto thought.<br>
<p>
I have recently written a paper on the DA which is<br>
available at<br>

<p>
For people who think they have an easy refutation, it might be worth<br>
to take a look at Leslie's book, where many standard objections<br>
are successfully countered.<br>
