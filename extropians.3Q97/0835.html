Amusing perhaps, but I find it very hard to take these seriously as<br>
explanations of human behavior.  It is not obvious to me, for example,<br>
that people want to ignore reality, that efficiency precludes<br>
interesting emotions, or that sane society is boring.  And I find the<br>
idea that wars are made to divert people from research rather<br>
implausible.  Perhaps these quotes don't do the book justice.<br>
