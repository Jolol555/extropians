<p>
The most interesting thing he references in the book (which I don't have<br>
any more) is an experiment (don't ask me the details, I can't remember)<br>
which showed that certain small amounts of psylocibin increase perceptual<br>
abilities, and slightly larger amounts than that increase libido.  (I<br>
haven't checked his references.)  I would be quite happy to admit it's<br>
all nonsense if it is, but if it isn't it's really quite exciting and<br>
thought provoking.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Besides, isn't savannahs (or coastal areas if you believe in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;aquatic ape theory) very poor in natural psychedelics? How would</i><br>
<i>&gt;McKenna explain that? </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
He goes into this question in the book.  Again, I can't<br>
remember the details, I'm sorry - it's a while since I read the book.<br>
<p>
Check it out.  He's a good writer, and he is coherent - he doesn't<br>
babble, and he really makes an effort to be clear and precise. If he's<br>
mad he's mad in a really interesting way, not a boring way like the<br>
usual flake. <br>
