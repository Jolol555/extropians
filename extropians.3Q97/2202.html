Bioweapons are far more likely to get out of control in a massive<br>
and destructive fashion than nukes or mechanosynthetic molecular<br>
nanotechnology. Weapons built by the genetic modifications of<br>
existing living organisms can bootstrap off of billions of years<br>
of testing of code for ability to survive in hostile environments.<br>
They can also be targeted to attack the central nervous system,<br>
and possibilities for subversion, "wounding" damage (more debilitating<br>
to an enemy than fatalities), and other havoc loom.  I will have<br>
to do a lot more thinking about this particular problem before I<br>
will have formed a clear opinion about it... I don't know if I'll<br>
succeed in ever forming a clear opinion of it.<br>
<p>
What's scary about terror fantasies of molecular nanotechnology is<br>
the replicative aspect. This is not actually likely to enter into<br>
mechanosynthetic molecular nanotechnology in the early stages, and<br>
thus is unlikely to surprise us much by the time it's actually<br>
here. Nukes don't replicate themselves without assistance anymore<br>
than early-stage mechanosynthetic systems are likely to. But<br>
bioweapons... all the self-replication code is *already there*.<br>
The rest is a matter of finding a bug that will go into the right<br>
vector, and equipping it with the right payload. And the actual<br>
nature of the research dovetails quite nicely out of current<br>
medical research, which is more and more beginning to look like<br>
the crafting of non-replicating chemical and other weapons<br>
against the bugs that like to eat us (many of which, like<br>
cancers, are *part* of us).  As Ani DiFranco says, every tool<br>
is a weapon if you hold it right.  I wonder how many defense<br>
ecologists are working at the Pentagon yet.<br>
<p>
Oh, am I indulging in disasturbation?  So sorry.   !!!<br>
<p>
World government is likely to exacerbate disagreements among the<br>
extremely varied peoples of the world, since government is an<br>
extremely poor method of resolving preexisting differences.  If<br>
the world government were to limit itself exclusively to military<br>
affairs and the prevention and suppression of outbreaks of open<br>
warfare (local civil wars, and the like), leaving all other affairs<br>
to substantially smaller regional governments with free intermigration,<br>
then I might assent, but I don't see any path in that direction,<br>
and anything much more intrusive or activist than that is likely<br>
to provoke and escalate more disputes than it settles and resolves.<br>
<p>
I think it would be a really good idea for us all to agree not to<br>
have any more major wars until after we get offplanet, ha ha.<br>
Nicholas, were these thoughts by any chance sparked by Eric Drexler's<br>
Extro-3 after-dinner quotation from Leon Trotsky? "You may not be<br>
very interested in war, but war is very interested in you!" or<br>
something like that.<br>
