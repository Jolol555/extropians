em&gt;Drexler's vision of nanotech involves self-replication in a big way.<br>
em&gt;Howeve Neil Stephenson (i think) in his book "Diamond Age" speaks of<br>
em&gt;"Sources" and "Matter Compilers"<br>
<p>
hal&gt;Yes, I think this is the right interpretation.  I don't think the<br>
hal&gt;nanotech in the book is capable of self-replication.  The reasons are<br>
hal&gt;not very clear, but perhaps it is in part due to some technical<br>
hal&gt;difficulty (hard to understand what, though), and in part it is pretty<br>
hal&gt;clear for political reasons.  <br>
---cut---<br>
hal&gt;The Seed is self-replicating, able to grow<br>
hal&gt;using available environmental resources.<br>
<p>
Anders Sandberg:<br>
as&gt;The problem is that to build a matter compiler you will likely need<br>
as&gt;self replication. <br>
<p>
CurtAdams@aol.com <br>
ca&gt;Of course nanotechnology assemblers may require factory conditions.  A<br>
ca&gt;replicator that can't work in the presence of oxygen or cosmic rays<br>
ca&gt;isn't going to gray goo this planet, but could be very handy in the<br>
ca&gt;appropriate factory.    <br>
<p>
as&gt;Didn't Stephenson assume the assemblers only worked in a vacuum? It<br>
as&gt;is very probable that the first assemblers will need very special<br>
as&gt;environments to work well, and not unreasonable to think that the<br>
as&gt;cost of designing robust assemblers is higher than providing them<br>
as&gt;with their special environments (and as you point out, it provides a<br>
as&gt;safety measure and gives the manufacturers more control).<br>

as&gt;Anders Sandberg<br>
<p>
em&gt;Hell...most people don't even have a clear idea of what MONEY is...now<br>
em&gt;try to imagine a culture that has no need for it?  (James Hogan wrote a<br>
em&gt; novella that addressed that subject...don't recall the title...had <br>
em&gt;to do with interstellar colinization..via vat grown embryos under<br>
em&gt;computer control).<br>
<p>
[Actually, I think that was Arthur Clarke, songs from Distant Earth - mwg]<br>
<p>
em&gt;The transition period is what's intriguing...anything beyond a few<br>
em&gt;years gets TOO fantastic..  but how will nanotech...cold<br>
em&gt;fusion...biotech...uploading...virtual  and augmented reality be<br>
em&gt;implemented...in the next few years?  SOON<br>
<p>
[The oft-mentioned singularity...]<br>
<p>
What nobody mentioned is the most common reason for now worrying about the<br>
Goo problem that the researchers always mention.  That is FUEL.  It was<br>
tangentially touched upon above, but mostly couched in ideas of<br>
environment.  My favorite example is, to paraphrase Ralph Merkle <br>
(<a href="http://www.merkle.com">http://www.merkle.com</a>) A horse and a car are both means of<br>
transportation, but you don't worry about you car going feral, running<br>
away from the garage, and living on tree sap in the forest. Cars aren't<br>
engineered to "live" without carefully refined fuel.  Neither will<br>
molecular robots or assemblers without a lot of deliberate work.<br>
Certainly, our defenses will be up by the time that is feasible.<br>
Although the organic quality of the creation of the "Seed" in the Diamond<br>
Age is aesthetically intriguing.<br>
