<i>&gt; mortgages is approximately equal to the total money supply (unsurprisingly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; if you understand where money comes from).  This then gives backing in</i><br>
<i>&gt; terms of real property.</i><br>
<p>
You sound so sure of that.<br>
<p>
Yes, some fiat tender is backed by real property. But loans in general<br>
need not be granted based upon bank assets. This is why you can<br>
*negotiate* with a bank for a mortgage and recieve a credit card. <br>
<p>
Some background:<br>
<p>
The whole point of the Federal Reserve's interest rate is to assign a<br>
price to the creation of a dollar. For example, let's say the Fed's<br>
interest rate is 7.0%. You go to the bank for a loan of $10,000. You are<br>
essentially asking that bank, "How much does $10,000 cost? The bank<br>
says, "Okay, $10,000 costs us (multiply by 7.0% and add the product),<br>
$10,700. So for you (given that we must profit from this) we will give<br>
you $10,000 for the low, low price of $10,800 (or at 8% interest -- I<br>
wish).  <br>
<p>
Lower the interest rate and what happens? The price of money is<br>
decreased and more people (given a relatively constant dollar value)<br>
seek loans. This is why I consolidated what little debt I had a few<br>
years ago. To take advantage of the low price of money (much less than<br>
my credit cards). <br>
<p>
By lowering the interest rate, the Fed lowers the price of a dollar<br>
which correspondingly increases the demand for a dollar.<br>
<p>
But, as banks loan more and more money (to buyers, investors,<br>
entrepreneurs, etc.) the supply of disposable dollars increases. What<br>
does this do? It lowers the value of a dollar -- or more simply, it<br>
causes inflation of prices. Where at one point 1 dollar could buy 1<br>
widget, inflation makes 1 widget cost $1.05 (or whatever). <br>
<p>
This is the business cycle. Recession, plateau, expansion, plateau,<br>
recession . . . <br>
<p>
It's all controlled by the Fed. <br>
<p>
So, my point is, after that annoying review of U.S. econ (which was more<br>
for my own amusement than anyone else's), money is created by way of<br>
bank loans. The process of "creating" money is in no way dependent on a<br>
"standard." Given real property, gold, or comic books, a bank needs<br>
nothing to create money out of thin air (except a charter from the Fed,<br>
or something like that). Interestingly, this is why a bank can offer you<br>
a credit card. True, this is type II money, but it is still money. A<br>
credit card offers people dollars at a very high price, and may have<br>
been a partial cause of inflation within the past two decades. <br>
<p>
The short of it is, I'm missing your point about the sum of mortgages<br>
being approximately equal to the money supply. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; } You need backing with a useful, valuable commodity (or service) in order</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; } for something to be accepted as money (or else the money itself needs to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; } be useful and valuable, like gold has been historically).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Gold was hardly useful or practically valuable itself.  Jewelry only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; goes so far, and chip wires are new and also probably don't go that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; far.  (You can't eat gold.)  But everyone believed that everyone else</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would sell food or iron or blacksmithing for gold, so everyone sold</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; things for gold.  Again, the real backing is mutual agreement, or rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; faith and habit which may get rationalized as mutual agreement.  (Or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they may not.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The big problem with getting something new accepted as money is</i><br>
<i>&gt; bootstrapping it.  It has to be valuable enough that people will accept</i><br>
<i>&gt; it even before everyone else will.  Gold and other early forms of money</i><br>
<i>&gt; (beads, etc.) had that property.  Fiat notes issued by me, scrawled on</i><br>
<i>&gt; a scrap of paper, do not.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree. The most important thing to a currency is how easily it can<br>
be counterfeited. Wood chips carved with a big "C" for currency will<br>
never be money. Wood is too common, and a currency based upon it is<br>
prone to easy counterfeit. This is why transmutation was such an<br>
intriguing thing. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to take a lump of lead<br>
and turn it into gold? Not because I like gold at all, but because it<br>
cannot be counterfeited -- gold is gold is gold. When Archimedes figured<br>
out how to determine how much gold composes a certain alloy ("Eureka!")<br>
he changed the world forever. (Okay, for a good long time at least.)<br>
Gold has a specific mass per volume. Mix in other metals and this mass<br>
per volume changes. The short of it is that gold turned out to be<br>
difficult to counterfeit. Even with nanotech one cannot counterfeit gold<br>
(picotech?).<br>
<p>
My point is that no item will become currency unless it is difficult to<br>
replicate. Who cares if it has value or not? As long as it can represent<br>
value, that's all that matters. I don't see what the hubbub is over<br>
money.          <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I can't see that there's any serious problem with fiat currency except</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the ability to "print" a lot of it, which seems to be generally accepted</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as a bad idea these days.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, historically the number of examples of fiat currency inflation has</i><br>
<i>&gt; almost been too many to count.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The bigger problem IMO is that usually any form of competition is</i><br>
<i>&gt; disallowed.  If the fiat currency had to compete with privately issued</i><br>
<i>&gt; banknotes that would provide needed discipline.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; At one time, casino chips began to be accepted in a small form in Las</i><br>
<i>&gt; Vegas for purchases.  (I think this was largely a promotional effort by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the casinos, something to be fun for the customers.)  This was stopped</i><br>
<i>&gt; because it violated the currency laws.  Similar attempts to set up local</i><br>
<i>&gt; scrips have also had problems.  They may be tolerated on a small scale,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but if they show signs of spreading they will be halted.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, the power to print currency is reserved to the Fed in the<br>
Constitution. But one must ask, "Why?" <br>
<p>
The Fed is inherently conservative in its fiscal policies. What I mean<br>
is that it will try to stay true to historical methods of dealing with<br>
economic woe rather than opt for an untried solution.<br>
<p>
Clearly, allowing local scrips is inflationary. Or, at the very least,<br>
creates money where money would not have been. This is of course very,<br>
very bad for central fiscal policy. No matter what the Fed does to<br>
reduce inflation, anyone with poker chips (or the capacity to make poker<br>
chips) may add to the money supply at will.  <br>
In short, I'm not surprised they hate new currencies.<br>
