<p>
I see what is attractive about suggesting that gender will become<br>
increasingly individualized, but when I puzzle through just what that<br>
might mean I find myself a bit befuddled...  I mean, there's an important<br>
sense in which gender is already an infinitely individualized phenomenon,<br>
defined by unrepeatably quirky histories, and flavored by a heady froth of<br>
kink.  Sex, gender, and sexuality reverberate with one another in<br>
complicated ways.  The conventional conceptualization of their relation is<br>
to think of sex as the biological substrate onto which gender as cultural<br>
construct is uneasily grafted and which in turn gives rise to the<br>
individual outpourings of sexuality, the expressions of individual sexual<br>
psyches. This tabulation overlooks (among other things) the extent to<br>
which the so-called foundational/biological sexual dimorphism may in fact<br>
play to the interests of the so-called non-foundational/cultural gender in<br>
the first place.  Judith Butler likes to point out that when the doctor<br>
says of a newborn, "It's a girl," she or he is not just identifying some<br>
neutral physiological fact about the infant, but pronouncing the first<br>
line of a script into which the child is immersed quite without a clue, a<br>
script which is expected to contain lots of lines she didn't author (e.g.,<br>
"I now pronounce you man and wife"), a script from which she undeniably<br>
can *deviate* but no less undeniably not without important risks and<br>
costs.<br>
	What we're really talking about here I guess are modes of<br>
*identification*, and while it is delicious to contemplate the prospect of<br>
identities that are smoothly engineered to our own specifications, I think<br>
we would would find the reality of such identities less than perfectly<br>
appealing.  When Wilde quipped that "Only the shallow know themselves," he<br>
was (as usual) deadly earnest.  We are always importantly opaque to<br>
ourselves, we are always surprising ourselves, exploring our<br>
potentialities.  I like the formulation (Arkuat's, I believe) that sex is<br>
just some seriously high-bandwidth communication, but I worry that this<br>
formulation may conjure a fantasy of an ideal sexual encounter as a kind<br>
of unimpeded free-flow of info... Just as important surely to the sexual<br>
expression of desire are the ways in which that expression is a<br>
negotiation among and overcoming of expectations and social scripts and<br>
relations of power, none of which are fully authored by us.  Think of how<br>
my maleness, my masculinity, my effeminacy, my queerness, my topness or<br>
bottomness are all registered from moment to moment in the expression of<br>
desire and sexual play.  We cite and subvert the scripts, but we hardly<br>
create the playing field ab initio.  What could it mean to do so<br>
intelligibly? Nanotechnology will no more junk gender than it will<br>
language or the economy.  Best, Dale<br>
