Judith, the COBOL Programer:   <br>
   <br>
Judith was a COBOL programmer in the late 1990s.  After years of deplorable<br>
treatment as a technological dinosaur by UNIX programmers, Judith was finally<br>
getting some respect.  She became a consultant specializing in year 2000<br>
date-compliant conversions.  She worked short-term assignments for<br>
prestigious companies and traveled all over the world.  While she had to work<br>
70, 80 and even 90 hours a week, it was worth it because she made a lot of<br>
money.   <br>
   <br>
Nevertheless, several years of this relentless, mind-numbing work took its<br>
toll on Judith.  She couldn't sleep and began having nightmares about the<br>
year 2000.  It reached a point where she became violently ill at the mere<br>
thought of the year 2000.  She had to do something or suffer a nervous<br>
breakdown.  All she could think about was avoiding the year 2000 and the<br>
turmoil coming with it.    <br>
   <br>
So, Judith contacted a company specializing in cryonics.  She made a deal to<br>
have herself frozen until March 15, 2000.  By that time all the year 2000 New<br>
Years Eve parties and computer debacles would be over.  Cryonics seemed like<br>
the only solution.  Judith was thrilled.  There would be no year 2000 to<br>
worry about and then she could get on with her life.   <br>
   <br>
She was put into a cryonics receptacle.  The technicians set the automatic<br>
re-animation date.  Injections of drugs slowed her heartbeat, she was frozen<br>
and that was that.   Time passed.  <br>
   <br>
Judith opened her eyes and was blinded by the bright white light.  She was in<br>
the middle of an enormous outdoors auditorium.  Excited people filled the<br>
bleachers surrounding her. They were all chanting "She's alive!  She's<br>
alive!"      <br>
   <br>
There were cameras unlike she'd ever seen before and equipment looking like<br>
it came out of a science fiction movie.  Judith couldn't contain her<br>
enthusiasm, "Is it over?  Has the year 2000 come?  Are the millennia parties<br>
and crisis over and done with?"    <br>
   <br>
A man who looked like the senior scientist stepped forward.  "I'm so sorry,"<br>
he said.  "There was a problem with your cryonics re-animation timer.  It's<br>
wasn't year-2000 compliant.  You've been in suspension for almost 8000<br>
years."     <br>
   <br>
"Oh no!  This is not the year 2000?!" she shouted.   <br>
   <br>
"Please, calm down.  There is someone here who wants to talk with you."   <br>
  <br>
Suddenly a wall-sized projection screen displayed the image of a man looking<br>
very much like Bill Gates.  "I'm Bill, the Chief Executive Officer of Earth.<br>
 There's no need to be upset.  This is a wonderful time to be alive.  There<br>
is world peace, everyone is rich and there is no need for governments or<br>
taxes.  The space program is self-funding from asteroid farming and there are<br>
colonies orbiting the Moon, Mars and in several nearby star systems.<br>
Technology has advanced to such a degree that everyone can travel by virtual<br>
reality and can contact anyone on or off the planet.  We participate in any<br>
entertainment whenever we want."   <br>
   <br>
Calming down Judith said, "That sounds terrific."  She was relieved and<br>
excited to restart her new life.   Still, being revived in an auditorium<br>
setting seemed wrong to her.  "Bill . . . I'm curious, why are all these<br>
people so interested in me?"   <br>
   <br>
"Well," he said, ". . . the year 10,000 is just around the corner and it says<br>
in your file you know COBOL."   <br>
