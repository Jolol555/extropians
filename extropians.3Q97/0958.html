Benford never went into any detail about it, and it was mainly an<br>
imaginative plot device and something that fit well into the theme of<br>
his pentalogy (the struggle and co-evolution of different phylums of<br>
"life"). His basic idea seems to be that once you have sufficiently<br>
rich "memospheres" where memes can thrive (like the Internet?),<br>
predatory memes can appear, some kind of meta-lebel entities which<br>
are not directly observable to the hosts of the memes (humans or<br>
computers). In fact, since they somehow *eat* memes, we can't event<br>
think or understand them. I seriously doubt that the last is<br>
possible, but it is a fun idea that there could exist beings which we<br>
are *by definition* unable to comprehend. <br>
