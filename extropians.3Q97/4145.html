<i>&gt; lots of other good stuff, but you can find no change when he presses the </i><br>
<i>&gt; button either. Our loony friend says "that's because the two brains were</i><br>
<i>&gt; identical, but really there was a huge change, I mean, after all, I exchanged </i><br>
<i>&gt; the brains". I maintain that absolutely nothing is happening and if there is </i><br>
<i>&gt; any difference between this man and a charlatan the difference is too small </i><br>
<i>&gt; to be measured.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In 1690 the philosopher and co-inventor (with Newton) of The Calculus,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Gottfried Leibniz, wrote about something he called " The Identity Of </i><br>
<i>&gt; Indiscernibles ". He said that things that you can measure are what's </i><br>
<i>&gt; important, and if there is no way to find a difference between two things </i><br>
<i>&gt; then they are identical, and switching the position of the objects does not </i><br>
<i>&gt; change the physical state of the system. This idea has turned out to be of</i><br>
<i>&gt; paramount importance in the scientific method, exchange forces in modern </i><br>
<i>&gt; physics and The Pauli Exclusion Principle in particular could not be derived </i><br>
<i>&gt; or understood without it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If objectively there is no difference and subjectively there is no difference </i><br>
<i>&gt; then there is no difference, nothing is happening when the button is pressed </i><br>
<i>&gt; and identity and consciousness can not be a function of position.</i><br>

Thank you, John Clark.  I would say our thoughts of self have begun to<br>
converge ;)<br>
<p>
Now that I have a greater understanding of your position, through many<br>
interesting thought experiments, I want to ask you some more applicable<br>
questions:<br>
<p>
When/if the technology becomes available, do you want to make a copy of<br>
yourself?<br>
<p>
If yes, why?<br>
<p>
If no, and a copy was made against your will, would you consider your<br>
copy/original a threat? Would you attempt to eliminate your copy/original <br>
so he wouldn't intrude on your niche? (of course, if your answer is yes,<br>
you should *probably* assume that your copy/original is going to do the<br>
same thing)<br>
<p>
I haven't thought about this question enough yet, but my first thought is<br>
that my original/copy would be a threat.  This means my orginal/copy's<br>
thoughts would probably be the same-- scary stuff!  This would make an<br>
interesting psychological thriller. ;)<br>

<i>&gt;         &gt;so their thoughts begin to diverge.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                             </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree with that entirely, if they get different inputs they will start to </i><br>
<i>&gt; diverge. I think that means survival is not a binary all or nothing matter. </i><br>

(ps. I hope you have the same policy as the other extropian who has the<br>
"all my ideas are in the public domain" signature, because I intend to use<br>
"survival is not binary" extensively)<br>
