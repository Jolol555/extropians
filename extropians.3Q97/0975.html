Small amounts of time add up. How much value you attach to your<br>
own time is your own affair, but you assume inaccurately if you<br>
assume that everyone values eir own time at the same rate.<br>
<p>
More than once on this list I have been informed that I didn't know<br>
what I was talking about, usually politely. There are so very many<br>
interesting things in the world to study and discuss, it seems<br>
rather stupid to insist on discussing a particular subject in a<br>
particular forum that some members of the forum have objected to.<br>
Ninety percent of the topics that are brought up here elicit no<br>
objections. If I were to bring up a topic of discussion and meet<br>
objections to it from more than one of the list old-timers (ooh,<br>
I'm biased, because I guess I've gotten to be one of those myself<br>
by now), I would take that topic to a forum where it was more<br>
welcome. And I usually follow this rule on any forum, including<br>
those forums in which I am *not* an old-timer,  not just the<br>
extropians list.<br>
<p>
This very discussion is particularly unwelcome to many (not all)<br>
because it is metadiscussion. At the very least, you could<br>
follow the convention of flagging it as such (illustrated on the<br>
subject line above) so that it may be more easily filtered by<br>
those who have no time to follow metadiscussion.<br>
<p>
To the best of our knowledge, if things go on as they have been<br>
going on for ages, we are all trapped on this planet and we are<br>
all doomed to die. Think about that next time you are impatient<br>
with a person who feels that e has no time for nonsense. Some<br>
folks are actually working hard for your and my benefit, and<br>
some of them use this list to obtain useful information.<br>
