In a message dated 97-08-28 00:32:47 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
<i>         &gt;You seem to forget that most people aren't "rational libertarian </i><br>
<i>         &gt;entities" </i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I don't  know about that....at a recent political convention (rally?) some of<br>
them sneaky libertarions were handing out the "world's smallest political<br>
quiz"...lot of people took the quiz....guess how it came out?...<br>
<p>
Most were libertarian in bent...even if they had never HEARD of libertarians<br>
before.<br>
<p>
It's them bastards with broadswords...they are the problem<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;For example, in this democracy many towns have laws against women wearing</i><br>
<i>&gt;string bikinis on the beach, and it's simple to see why, there are plenty of</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;prudes and it doesn't cost them anything to  </i><br>
<p>
And suppose the girls "don't wear the string bikinis on the beach"...if you<br>
get what i mean...the prudes go ballistic then...???<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;I've HAD fun once...I remember what it's like...fondly...&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Try promoting the extropian principles in the Middle East or Africa</i><br>
<i>        &gt; etc, and see how far you'll get...</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Ex-what?  No..I never heard of it...the only thing I read is the Bible...and<br>
listen to the Revernd Brother Black on Radio...and watch Jerry Falwell on<br>
Tv....sure you don't wann buy one of these Plastic Jesus's?  Good for your<br>
soul.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;About as far as you would in the bible belt of the USA.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;it's "bye, bye singularity" when the Muslims take over.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Your xenophobia is starting to sound a little silly.</i><br>
<p>
Are you paranoid if they're REALLY out o get you?  I agree...with fanatical<br>
Relegious freaks in charge (of any flavor) we ain't gonna get very far...a<br>
less malovelent example is seen in the Mennonites and Amish in the<br>
US...hardly a paragon of technological sophistication...A less benign example<br>
are the fundamental fanatically Muslim sects...Anyone in the right mind<br>
should be concerned about them.<br>
