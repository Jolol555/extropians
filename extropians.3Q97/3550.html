Holly is concerned that the pace of change will leave some<br>
people behind. She implies that we may need to slow down a<br>
bit to avoid severe societal disruption.<br>
<p>
Most of the arguments against slowing down have been<br>
centered on one of two points:<br>
  1) I am not my brother's keeper: each person must<br>
adapt as best they can.<br>
  2) Change is intvitble, and even it's rate is beyond<br>
our effective control.<br>
<p>
I have a much bigger objection to slowing the pace. I feel<br>
that we are currently in a race between the forces of<br>
overpopulation and the advance of technology. If we slow<br>
down, we run a huge risk of losing the race. The best<br>
hope for everybody is to reach the nanotech breakthrough<br>
as soon as possible. This has the potential to make each<br>
human on earth able to live a luxurious life with no need<br>
for work. The longer we delay, the more suffering there<br>
will be and the more resources we will destroy. Worst<br>
case, sodiety collapses and we never reach the breakthrough.<br>
<p>
In my opinion, the nanotech era will very rapidly cause<br>
our existing economic concepts to become meaningless.<br>
We will move from the first assembler to the ability<br>
to build anything within a few years at most. With this<br>
ability, nothing material will have economic value, since<br>
anybody can build anything, given only the designs.<br>
<p>
Designs are works of art, specifically the art of the<br>
designer. Artists (including engineering designers<br>
and programmers) like to get paid, and also like to<br>
design. Most of them will be prfectly happy to give<br>
their designs away. The only reason they don't give them<br>
away now is that then need to make a living. Given<br>
an unlimited income, these folks will design for the joy<br>
of it, and publish the results because they like to<br>
be recognized as good designers.<br>
<p>
You may ask how an impoverished peasant will benefit.<br>
The answer is that somebody will distribute a<br>
self-replicating "starter kit" for free. Who will<br>
distribute the kit? a designer will design the first<br>
one for the fun of it, of course.<br>
