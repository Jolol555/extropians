See my other posting on this. Photons may have hidden variables and know<br>
they exist, but I don't know that. This is a kind of "Copenhagen"<br>
approach to consciousness. If something cannot be tested, the simplest<br>
assumption is that it does not exist. Communication is essential for<br>
testability here. I suppose souls are conscious too, but I don't know<br>
how to establish either souls or their awareness, as their very<br>
definition include ineffability, which to me translates as "nyaah nyaah<br>
nyaay, this is real and you can't say otherwise". Really useful, you<br>
know?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; The last thing the world need is more 'Turing style' tests.  Do you really</i><br>

<p>
Show me something better! The thing that the TT has is that it limits<br>
the kind of communication to separate out factors such as what the<br>
participants look like, and that said communication is linguistic. BTW,<br>
all digital communication can be seen as linguistic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Any discussions we have with something so different what not be anything like</i><br>
<i>&gt; talking to a human.  In the same way, many different forms of consciousness</i><br>
<i>&gt; exist and they are all so different that such a test would not prove</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness, it would only prove similar lines of thought sorrounding</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
An important point. Consciousness is indeed defined by how we see it!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I agree that we need a definition of consciousness, but this is far from it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
As I said, let's hear better ones. I like simplicity, self reference and<br>
TESTABILITY to be part of such definitions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think there are two things we are talking about in these posts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; *Being aware - the very idea that I am conscious and I am looking out at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Condition 2.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; *How I relate the physical to the abstract (that which exists in my mind) -</i><br>
<i>&gt; How I see blue.. how you see blue, and how we relate seeing that colour to</i><br>
<i>&gt; emotion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Condition 1.<br>
<p>
BTW - anybody figured out how to derive "soul" from my definition...<br>
have fun!<br>
