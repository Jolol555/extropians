} opposed to worrying about having enough education to survive the next<br>
} three decades, or having humanity be convicted of inefficiency and wiped<br>
} out.<br>
<p>
Which may be why I didn't mention stock ownership originally under "The<br>
meta-invisible hand."  The invisible meta-hand these days is the free<br>
market being hampered by those who don't want to be subjected to it full<br>
blast.  The spontaneous order of democracy and redistribution rising<br>
from people's fear of the spontaneous order of the free market.  The<br>
free-market is _not_ the most productive of all systems in the event of<br>
provoking its own riots.  We've been here before: "But the poor are<br>
richer than under any other system!  If people were just rational, and<br>
paid attention to absolute rather than relative wealth, they'd stop<br>
whining!"<br>
<p>
Guess what?  The more extreme Singularity projections are the best<br>
rational justification for people to worry about the gap between rich<br>
and poor.  Higher absolute standards of living are meaningless if the<br>
rich are so far ahead that they can turn upon the poor with impunity,<br>
and if nanotech makes it positively attractive to do so.  Conversely,<br>
John Galt speeches about "not asking any man to live for me" won't<br>
impress a frightened mob who think you're the next Dr. Frankenstein or<br>
Strangelove whose dream will endanger their children.<br>
<p>
P.S. on stock ownership... I estimate $200,000 capital per person,<br>
for a minimal income.  5 billion people.  Total capital: $10^15, one<br>
thousand American trillion dollars.  World GNP (ha) is estimated at $17<br>
trillion.  Are there any estimates on world capital?  Not that these are<br>
absolute numbers, I'd expect the economy to change as education and<br>
capital spread around, and GNP is a lousy metric at best.<br>
