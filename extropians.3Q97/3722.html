<i>&gt;I think it was Eliezer S. Yudkowsky who wrote</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To solve the crack ghettos I need to ... use force-evolved viruses to </i><br>
<i>&gt;target cocaine supplies.</i><br>
<p>
And I suppose you would have been in favor of engineering a blight during<br>
alcohol prohibition in order to "solve" the problems caused by bathtub gin,<br>
had it been technologically feasible?  <br>
<p>
I don't want you, or the nanny state, "protecting" me from "evil" drugs. <br>
<p>
It is frightening to think of the power of a nanny state using biotechnology<br>
or nanotechnology to implement the latest item in the public health agenda.<br>
Want to stop people from smoking?...just unleash the newest super strain of<br>
tobacco mosaic virus and let'em go to work. <br>
<p>
I have always thought that it would be a more tolerant society if everyone<br>
had to pay for the laws/programs they wanted enforced.  I might choose to<br>
hire a private eye to recover stolen merchandise, but I wouldn't pay to send<br>
troops to Bolivia to burn the cocoa fields, nor engineer viruses that target<br>
the current illicit drug. Too bad our political system empowers<br>
'do-gooders', like the Clintons, who have big ideas about how we should all<br>
be living our lives, and little regard for my individual choices.<br>
<p>
I don't see how Elizer can "target" cocaine supplies with his new virus,<br>
without violating individual/property rights, even if he develops it in his<br>
basement with his own funds. Unless he intends to unleash it only in his own<br>
house.<br>
