What the hell are these nanites living on?!  Their very life requires<br>
energy, not to mention, as Anders noted, the cost of trying to<br>
concentrate extremely diffuse and oxygen-bonded uranium.  Solar<br>
collection will take lots of area, be noticeable, and be exposed.  Shade<br>
it, dust it, bomb it.  Oh, not to mention the probable heat emissions<br>
from all this activity.  We're talking very unstealthy things here.<br>
<p>
And they're not living off of rock.  It's hard to get lower energy<br>
states than found in a lot of rock without using nuclear processes.<br>
That's why aluminum mining is so expensive.<br>

<p>
I challenge this "lower division" assumption.  Antibodies can't gum up<br>
the works of nanites; phagocytic cells can't enclose and dissolve them?<br>
Hydrogren peroxide and free radicals are popular weapons.  Oxidizing<br>
chemicals vs. small pieces of pure carbon; I bet on the white blood cell.<br>

Remember, life is nanotechnology.  The design is obscure and it's all<br>
wet.  Defensively, the latter is not necessarily a disadvantage.<br>

<p>
Yes.  So, is it easier to create nanites in a hostile environment, or<br>
destroy them?  <br>
<p>
And is the energy state of diamondoid material higher than that of<br>
organic material?  Probably, in which case this gray goo plague needs<br>
constant input or can only grow by processing lots of material -- which<br>
means that it grows very slowly.<br>
<p>

<p>
Wait, diamond nanites are attacking diamond skin?  If there's so much<br>
energy for the plague to live on, obviously your outer defense shouldn't<br>
be a hard shell, it should be a friendly counter-plague, like the<br>
friendly flora living on our mucous membranes.<br>
<p>

Damn complex plague, building explosives in a coordinated manner.  You<br>
sure it doesn't have internal communiation lines that can be attacked?<br>
