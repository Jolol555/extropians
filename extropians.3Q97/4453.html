One of the problems with political discussions is that they can<br>
hardly become specific without also becoming parochial.  It's<br>
hard enough to keep an eye on the machinations of one<br>
government, much less the whole lot of them.  So I apologize<br>
for the parochialism of my reply.<br>
<p>
WesBurt@aol.com writes:<br>
(quoting Bertrand Russell)<br>
<i> &gt; "The expense of children aught to be borne wholly by the community.</i><br>
<i> &gt; Their food and clothing and education aught to be provided, not</i><br>
<i> &gt; only to the very poor as a matter of charity, but to all classes</i><br>
<i> &gt; as a matter of public interest.  </i><br>
<p>
Support of children by the state means control of the children by<br>
the state.  "No strings attached" money has a very short halflife<br>
in political reality.  Control of the children by the state is a<br>
bit too Ingsoc for my taste, thank you.  I think if children are to<br>
be controlled by anyone, it should be by the people who have to<br>
put up with them on a day-to-day basis, not a bunch of politicians.<br>
<p>
(I should probably show my bias: several friends and relatives<br>
of mine have had to endure parts of their childhood under<br>
state-sponsored foster care.  The reports they bring back to me<br>
of their experiences are horrifying.  As far as I know, state<br>
orphanages don't have a much better reputation.)<br>
<p>
(more Bertie)<br>
<i> &gt; In addition to this, a woman who</i><br>
<i> &gt; is capable of earning money, and who abandons wage-earning for</i><br>
<i> &gt; motherhood, aught to receive from the State as nearly as possible</i><br>
<i> &gt; what she would have received if she had not had children.</i><br>
<p>
This is not yet the case with AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent<br>
Children) and related welfare programs in the United States.  I<br>
don't pretend to be able to analyze such a complex system of<br>
incentives, but this is a sore point with the people who virulently<br>
oppose AFDC and related programs in the United States.<br>
<p>
So if you tried to implement this part of Russell's plan, most<br>
of your opposition would be from the sort of politician<br>
currently labeled "liberal" in the US.<br>
<p>
But this part of the proposal is ludicrous, because it requires<br>
a state agency capable of accurately guessing whether or not a<br>
woman is capable of earning money, instead of just taking her<br>
word for it, and this is impossible.  The only right thing to<br>
do here is to take the woman's word for it, which throws the<br>
system open to exploitation by deceitful people.  I can't think<br>
of any way around this, other than something like Ingsoc, which<br>
is hardly minimal socialism.<br>
<p>
(more Bertie)<br>
<i> &gt;  The only condition attached to State maintenance of mother and</i><br>
<i> &gt;  child should be that both parents are physically and mentally</i><br>
<i> &gt; sound in all ways likely to affect the children."</i><br>
<p>
Huh?  Sounds like state-sponsored eugenics to me.<br>
<p>
(back to WesBurt)<br>
<i> &gt; The mode of society that provides minimum government, maximum</i><br>
<i> &gt; individual freedom, and security for all is not located on the</i><br>
<i> &gt; political spectrum line between anarchy and communism.  It is</i><br>
<i> &gt; located on the perpendicular bi-sector of that line, equi-distant</i><br>
<i> &gt; from both of those fallacies.</i><br>
<p>
Sounds like Nolan's chart, okay.<br>
<p>
(WesBurt)<br>
<i> &gt; Lets hear some clever dialog from the faint-hearted lurkers on the</i><br>
<i> &gt; several mail lists listed on Burt's list.</i><br>
<p>
Let's have a little respect for the other participants in the<br>
lists to which you are blind-carbon-copying your posts.<br>
Crossposting more than occasionally is itself questionable;<br>
crossposting to a number of lists with the Bcc: field could be<br>
seen as rude.<br>
