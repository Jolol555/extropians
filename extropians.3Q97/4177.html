NSPIC is a nice catchy little title, but if you're going to post<br>
something that long, at least give me some specifics about the theory.<br>
Words have meanings. Sometimes more than one. You're suggesting that by<br>
using a word in a certain way, I may be reinforcing the illusions of<br>
Statism. <br>
<p>
Well, that's Max's Deep Anarchy article, yes.<br>
<p>
Your major breakthrough sounds awfully duplicative. Where do you diverge<br>
from or develop on Deep Anarchy? What discursive constructions are the<br>
"worst?" What are the specific illusions reinforced by them? Why among<br>
your seven lines of inquiry for debate is it assumed that the theory<br>
cannot be falsified? <br>
<p>
Looking for a bit more,<br>
