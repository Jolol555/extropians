I wrote a COBOL program for an IBM 4090 that was still in<br>
use in 1970, and I've been buying home computers since<br>
1977. Somehow, My home computers always cost $2500-$3500.<br>
<p>
Thinkng back causes real brain-warp: I splurged and fully<br>
populated the memory board in my IMSAI8080: I filled it<br>
all the way up to 4Kbytes (that's four kilobytes): people<br>
with less money could elect to populate it in increments<br>
of 256 bytes by purchasing the 256-by-4 bit memory chips<br>
in pairs. The processor was an Intel 8080 with a 2Mhz clock.<br>
My first disk drive was a 5.25" floppy which<br>
could store an astounding 144Kbytes on a diskette. The drive<br>
and electronics cost $1000.<br>
<p>
This is very relevant to extropy: That was 20 years ago.<br>
My latest computer has A 266Mhz Pentium, 6Gbyte disk,<br>
64Mbyte mem, and lots of peripherals. It is somewhere<br>
between a thousand and a million times as capable as<br>
my first computer. There is no evidence that this trend<br>
will slow in the next 20 years, but we keep making projections<br>
that underestimate or ignore the consequences. If we add in the<br>
closely-related advances in data cumunications, this is<br>
IMO the single most important trend affecting the future<br>
of humanity.<br>
