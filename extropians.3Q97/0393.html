THE DECLARATION OF INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY<br>
<p>
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for people to<br>
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with others, and to<br>
assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which<br>
they may choose to aspire, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind<br>
requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the<br>
separation. We hold that no truths are self-evident, but must have their<br>
usefulness demonstrated. That all people are created with equal freedom from<br>
tyranny, but frequently accept domination or obedience to a legal code, to a<br>
greater or lesser degree from person to person. That people are endowed with<br>
only what rights they have chosen to be endowed with, through wisdom or<br>
common folly, for wealth or ilth. That people can secure for themselves, with<br>
understanding of their own unique situations, those rights which best allow<br>
them to live in fruitful harmony with other people. That whenever any person,<br>
Government, or other entity, not fully recognizing the unique situation of<br>
each individual, becomes in any way oppressive or destructive, people may<br>
choose to ignore, alter or abolish such an institution, and to live in<br>
whatever manner they decide, with understanding of the situation, will allow<br>
them whatever conflict or harmony they so require for their happiness and<br>
survival. That man can choose to resolve any conflict through intelligence,<br>
with, adequate communication and a full understanding of each and every point<br>
of view involved, by each and every person involved. Prudence, indeed, will<br>
dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and<br>
transient causes, but only after calm consideration of the True Will and<br>
mutual goals of all those individuals involved. All experience has shown that<br>
people are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right<br>
themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a<br>
long train of abuses and usurpations evinces a design to reduce them under<br>
absolute Despotism or Dogma not chosen by the individual concerned, it is<br>
their right, it can be their choice, to throw off such a Governmentand to<br>
accept responsibility, each for their own future security.<br>
<p>
The most apparent difficulty herein lies in the general inability of people<br>
to understand the specific direction of their unique organism, or,<br>
understanding it, to make the firm resolve necessary to shake free the<br>
shackles of cultural conditioning and Dogma accepted through poorly<br>
considered indoctrination. Therefore, those of us who now declare their<br>
individual autonomy (and this document speaks only for those who freely<br>
choose to do so) are faced with a potentially arduous task of<br>
self-examination, compounded by the resistance encountered from those who do<br>
not comprehend the changes engendered by this individual declaration. But the<br>
rewards of this liberation are enormous, being the very fulfillment of each<br>
individual's own nature, and therefore the nature of the human race as a<br>
whole. Those of us who choose to accept this self-responsibility do so, we<br>
believe, for the advantage of all.<br>
<p>
The crimes against individuals by those who blindly group together under the<br>
flags of Governments, religions, and other institutions are too numerous to<br>
fully discuss, but can be categorized in the following way: Actual<br>
legislation which limits the freedom of individuals in speech, worship,<br>
thought, and any actions which do not, themselves, infringe upon the freedoms<br>
of others; Cultural norms, taboos, peer pressures, moral codes and any other<br>
influences which likewise limit the freedoms of individuals.<br>
<p>
It should be strongly emphasized that we recognize that various dogmas,<br>
models and systems are necessary for the harmonious growth of humanity, but,<br>
in all things, these can be the choice of the individual. If one person and<br>
another believe that it is their will to band together for a specific<br>
purpose, under delineated restrictions, then they are free to do so, given<br>
that their purpose still respects and allows the differing beliefs and<br>
actions of those who stay apart from their group. If one person believes that<br>
it is his will to stand apart from all others, then he is free to do so,<br>
given that he does not interfere with the free behavior of any other. In the<br>
same manner, the dogma or meta-dogma of this Declaration is intended to apply<br>
only to those who freely choose to accept it as being beneficial or useful in<br>
the attainment of their own True Will.<br>
<p>
We, therefore, the people of the planet Earth who choose to accept<br>
responsibility for our own lives, do publish and declare that we can be FREE<br>
AND INDEPENDENT PEOPLE, that we are absolved from all allegiance to any<br>
dogma, system or code that we have not chosen for ourselves, that we as<br>
individuals have full power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances,<br>
establish Commerce and to do all other Acts and Things which individual<br>
People may of right do.<br>
