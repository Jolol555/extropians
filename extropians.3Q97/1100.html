This is from the ever-so-handy Dictionary of Word Origins (it's for =<br>
the word 'liberal' - but liberal and libertarian are obviously =<br>
etymologically related):<br>
<p>
"liberal  [14]  The Latin word for 'free' was _liber_. It came from =<br>
the same prehistoric source as Greek _ele=FAtheros_ 'free,' which may =<br>
have denoted 'people, nation' (in which case the underlying =<br>
etymological meaning of the word would be 'being a member of the =<br>
(free) people,' as opposed to 'being a slave'). From _liber_ was =<br>
derived _liberalis_ 'of freedom,' which passed into English via Old =<br>
French _liberal_. Its earliest English meanings were 'generous' and =<br>
'appropriate to the cultural pursuits of a 'free' 'man' (as in 'the =<br>
liberal arts'). The connotations of 'tolerance' and 'lack of =<br>
prejudice' did not emerge until the 18th centure, and the word's use =<br>
as a designation of a particular political party in Britain dates =<br>
from  the early 19th century.<br>
  "Also from Latin _liber_ come English _libertine_ [14] and =<br>
_liberty_ [14]."<br>
<p>
The number in brackets indicates the century of the word's first use. =<br>
[14] means the word was first used in the 14th century.<br>
