This is quite an interesting exchange.  Very early on when I teach my<br>
argumentation and writing classes, I point out that there are at least<br>
*four* reasons to engage in argument: one, to clarify your thinking; two,<br>
to persuade a person of the correctness or at least reasonableness of your<br>
claim; three, to convince a person to undertake some particular action; or<br>
four, to facilitate a reconciliation among initially incompatible<br>
viewpoints.  It seems to me fairly straightforward that assuming and<br>
defending a position -- even if in a provisional or improvisatory manner<br>
-- in a free and open encounter is a good way to bring to light unexpected<br>
flaws and possibilities in that position.  And the reasons are broadly<br>
evolutionary in a memetic kinda sorta way -- your favorite flavor. <br>
Argument for argument's sake isn't an *ideal* way to clarify one's views<br>
insofar as we can distinguish understanding from strategic advantage.  The<br>
victor in the free and open encounter may rely more for success on a<br>
winning personality or a compellingly euphonious turn of phrase, than a<br>
sound or creative argument, etc. etc.  Eric's musings that position-taking<br>
may tap into territoriality and other lizard-brain behaviors in ways that<br>
figure in the ultimate efficacy of argument for argument's sake seem to<br>
generate as much evidence against the attractiveness of the practice as<br>
for it.  I'm wondering just what *practices* you have in mind when you<br>
speak of general critique as opposed to position-taking as a way of<br>
clarifying one's ideas?  Best, Dale<br>
