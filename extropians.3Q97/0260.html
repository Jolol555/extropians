As of this hour, I have a Ph.D. in Social Science from Caltech!<br>
<p>
My thesis is available (minus some figures) at:<br>

Paper copies are available to those who ask in the next week, and who<br>
promise to look at it.  <br>

  Four Puzzles in Information and Politics: Product Bans, Informed<br>
        Voters, Social Insurance, &amp; Persistent Disagreement<br>
<p>
<p>
In four puzzling areas of information in politics, simple intuition<br>
and simple theory seem to conflict, muddling policy choices.  This<br>
thesis elaborates theory to help resolve these conflicts.<br>
<p>
The puzzle of product bans is why regulators don't instead offer the<br>
equivalent information, for example through a ``would have banned''<br>
label.  Regulators can want to lie with labels, however, either due to<br>
regulatory capture or to correct for market imperfections.  Knowing<br>
this, consumers discount regulator warnings, and so regulators can<br>
prefer bans over the choices of skeptical consumers.  But all sides<br>
can prefer regulators who are unable to ban products, since then<br>
regulator warnings will be taken more seriously.<br>
<p>
The puzzle of voter information is why voters are not even more poorly<br>
informed; press coverage of politics seems out of proportion to its<br>
entertainment value.  Voters can, however, want to commit to becoming<br>
informed, either by learning about issues or by subscribing to<br>
sources, to convince candidates to take favorable positions.  Voters<br>
can also prefer to be in large groups, and to be ignorant in certain<br>
ways.  This complicates the evaluation of institutions, like voting<br>
pools, which reduce ignorance.<br>
<p>
The puzzle of group insurance as a cure for adverse selection is why<br>
this should be less a problem for groups than individuals.  The usual<br>
argument about reduced variance of types for groups doesn't work in<br>
separating equilibria; what matters is the range, not variance, of<br>
types.  Democratic group choice can, however, narrow the group type<br>
range by failing to represent part of the electorate.  Furthermore,<br>
random juries can completely eliminate adverse selection losses.<br>
<p>
The puzzle of persistent political disagreement is that for ideal<br>
Bayesians with common priors, the mere fact of a factual disagreement<br>
is enough of a clue to induce agreement.  But what about agents like<br>
humans with severe computational limitations?  If such agents agree<br>
that they are savvy in being aware of these limitations, then any<br>
factual disagreement implies disagreement about their average<br>
biases.  Yet average bias can in principle be computed without any<br>
private information.  Thus disagreements seem to be fundamentally<br>
about priors or computation, rather than information.<br>
