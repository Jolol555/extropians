<i>&gt; &gt; Eliezer, I'm curious about why you think that no "most marketable good"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will emerge in your proposed complex-barter economy.  "Most marketable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; goods" are indistinguishable from money.  Gold and silver were the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; marketable goods that emerged from barter economies of the past in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Middle East, Europe, China, and elsewhere.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, I anticipated something like that happening.  Food, medical supplies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; certain consumer goods, and other things that change hands quickly and rapidly</i><br>
<i>&gt; are likely to become..."Exchange nexuses."</i><br>
<p>
There is one important sense in which such things are different from<br>
"money", in that they cannot be created by fractional-reserve lending.<br>
But even when one agrees on a commodity for exchange, the convenience<br>
of abstracting it is so great that it can't be avoided.<br>
<p>
In the neighborhood of my grandmother's farm in Alabama, the common<br>
unit of exchange was the egg: people would mow a lawn or weed a garden<br>
for a dozen, trade a dozen and a half for a bushel of tomatoes, etc.<br>
Even there, it was common for folks to draw up IOUs in terms of eggs,<br>
and never pay them off in actual eggs--just tear up mutual ones, or<br>
trade them for something else.  Yes, they did trade other people's<br>
IOUs, and honor their own whoever presented them for collection.  I<br>
don't think it ever occurred to any of them that they could "loan"<br>
eggs they didn't really have by giving IOUs, but it might have.<br>
<p>
"Money" is nothing more than an agreement among individuals to abstract<br>
some valuable for convenience of trade.  Those who oppose the idea are<br>
just being stubbornly anti-social.<br>
