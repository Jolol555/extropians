"Our biology has made us into creatures who are constantly<br>
recreating our psychic and material environments, and whose<br>
individual lives are the outcomes of an extraordinary<br>
multiplicity of intersecting causal pathways. Thus, it is our<br>
biology that makes us free." -- Richard Lewontin<br>

SCIENTISTS URGE CAUTION IN AWARDING OF HUMAN GENE PATENTS<br>
Continuing the expression of concern about the manner in which<br>
current U.S. intellectual property laws may interfere with<br>
scientific research, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences has<br>
joined the National Institutes of Health and the Human Genome<br>
Organization in protesting an interpretation of current patent<br>
law that would permit the issuing of patents on what are called<br>
"expressed gene sequence tags". Bruce Alberts, president of the<br>
National Academy of Sciences, warns against "patents that allow<br>
an early group of inventors who have disclosed little new<br>
knowledge to constrain the actions of subsequent investigators."<br>
(Nature 26 June)<br>
<p>
SECRECY OF AGRICULTURAL GENOME DATABASES CRITICIZED<br>
If there is one area where molecular genetics is of international<br>
political relevance it is agriculture. Every country is<br>
interested in improving its food supply, and to this end there is<br>
much effort devoted to genetics research, particularly research<br>
to map the genomes of plants such as corn and rice. Plant<br>
biologist Christopher Somerville (Carnegie Institution of<br>
Washington in Stanford, CA US) recently criticized the delays by<br>
some countries in releasing plant genome data to the scientific<br>
community. The laboratories slowest to release data already in<br>
their possession are evidently in Europe, Japan, and China.<br>
Apparently, no release from China of acquired data has yet<br>
occurred. In the U.S., projects underway by corporate giants such<br>
as Monsanto and DuPont have also not been eager to supply data.<br>
The consequence is that plant molecular geneticists are deprived<br>
of scientific information important for their own research, the<br>
results of which are by tradition freely reported and available<br>
to everyone. (Science 27 June)<br>
<p>
LEGISLATORS ANGRY AT POSSIBLE NIH-FUNDED EMBRYO RESEARCH<br>
Harold Varmus, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health<br>
(NIH), evidently had a difficult time before a Congressional<br>
investigating committee on June 19th. The issue was the ban by<br>
the U.S. Congress of NIH-funded embryo research. An established<br>
researcher, Mark Hughes, apparently used NIH facilities while<br>
pursuing his investigations of disease-causing mutations in DNA<br>
extracted from single cells from embryos created by in vitro<br>
fertilization techniques. Evidently Varmus and Hughes cannot<br>
agree whether Hughes knew his research was proscribed, and NIH<br>
has severed its connection with Hughes. Meanwhile, the<br>
Congressional subcommittee has warned Varmus to enforce the rules<br>
concerning embryo research more strictly. (Science 27 June)<br>
<p>
LACK OF RULES CONCERNING AUTHORSHIP LISTINGS CRITICIZED<br>
Since scientists are usually evaluated in terms of both the<br>
quality and quantity of what they publish, and since most<br>
scientific publications these days are produced by more than one<br>
author (sometimes by as many as twenty authors), there exists<br>
what is called the "authorship problem", which has several<br>
aspects. For example, people who have only a tangential but<br>
influential bureaucratic relationship with a research group may<br>
force the inclusion of their names as "authors" of a scientific<br>
report. Another problem is that some laboratories list the senior<br>
author last, others list the senior author first, and still other<br>
laboratories list all authors alphabetically at the head of the<br>
research report. There are no rules, much confusion, occasional<br>
bitterness, unfair advantages, petty disputes, and so on, and<br>
this week an unsigned editorial in Nature criticizes the<br>
authorship system in general and says any solution to the problem<br>
seems hopeless. Scientists, after all, are members of the human<br>
species. (Nature 26 June)<br>
<p>
ASTRONOMERS AGREEING ON THEORY OF GALAXY FORMATION AND EVOLUTION<br>
Among contemporary cosmologists, there are two prevailing models<br>
for the formation of galaxies. One model is hierarchical, in the<br>
sense that small amorphous proto-galaxies are considered to form<br>
first, these evolving into spiral galaxies, and the spiral<br>
galaxies then merging to form elliptical galaxies. The other<br>
model is a completely different picture, considering the various<br>
galaxies to form from the condensation of single massive dust<br>
clouds, with the particular type of galaxy formed dependent on<br>
the nature of the dust cloud collapse. At two recent cosmology<br>
symposia, in view of new red-shift data (shifts to the red end of<br>
the spectrum of light from the galaxies) provided by the Hubble<br>
Space Telescope, cosmologists are apparently forming a consensus<br>
that the first idea, the hierarchical model, is more consistent<br>
with the observed data than the second model. The Hubble Space<br>
Telescope has brought a renaissance to cosmology, and we are only<br>
at the beginning of the new era. (Nature 26 June)<br>
<p>
OPTICAL STUDIES OF A GAMMA-RAY BURST SUGGEST FIREBALL MODEL<br>
Studies of the mysterious gamma-ray bursts seen in every part of<br>
the sky daily continue to be reported. This week we have the<br>
results of observations of gamma ray burst (GRB) GRB970508, which<br>
occurred on May 8, 1997 (hence the name). Optical studies of the<br>
source of the burst by M. R. Metzger et al (California Institute<br>
of Technology, US; National Radio Astronomy Observatory, US;<br>
Institute of Space Astrophysics, Frascati IT; University of<br>
Ferrara, IT) using data from the recently orbited Italian-Dutch<br>
satellite BeppoSAX indicate the source of the GRB is extra-<br>
galactic at a distance of 5 billion parsecs (about 20 trillion<br>
miles). Taking into account the recorded energy and its loss by<br>
intervening absorption across that distance, we are considering<br>
an initial energy burst with a magnitude equal to the total<br>
radiation from our Sun during the entire age of the universe. The<br>
computed energy figure is 10exp51 ergs of gamma-rays. A consensus<br>
among astrophysicists is forming that these GRBs involve<br>
"relativistic fireballs" produced by colliding neutron stars,<br>
either two neutron stars colliding with each other, or single<br>
neutron stars colliding with black holes. The various radiant<br>
energy data are coming in so rapidly now, there is a feeling the<br>
physical nature of GRBs will soon be completely understood.<br>
(Nature 26 June)<br>

UNEXPECTED SHAPES FORMED BY COLLOIDS IN MICROGRAVITY CONDITIONS<br>
Colloids are extremely small phases (e.g., solid particles) in<br>
the range one nanometer to one micron dispersed in a larger phase<br>
of a different substance, for example in water. They can be<br>
bubbles, globules, microcrystals, etc. In the 1930s, many cell<br>
biologists were excited by the study of colloids because the<br>
interior of the living cell, protoplasm, has many properties of a<br>
colloidal suspension. These days the study of colloids is almost<br>
exclusively the province of the physical chemist. Although<br>
colloidal particles are small, they are much larger than<br>
molecules, large enough to perhaps be affected by gravitational<br>
forces. This week the results of experiments with uniform<br>
colloidal polymer particles carried out in microgravity<br>
conditions aboard the space shuttle Columbia in November 1995<br>
were reported by Jixiang Zhu et al (Princeton University, US;<br>
NASA Lewis Research Center, US; University of Bristol, UK;<br>
Johnson Space Flight Center, US). It was found that the colloidal<br>
crystallization properties of the particles studied are indeed<br>
significantly different under microgravity conditions.<br>
Theoretical models of the behavior of colloidal suspensions<br>
therefore need to take into account the gravitational forces<br>
acting on the particles. (Nature 26 June)<br>

NEW DATA WEAKENS LINKAGE BETWEEN CLIMATE AND MAMMALIAN EVOLUTION<br>
Paleobiologists have traditionally considered drastic climate<br>
changes to be the major provocation in the emergence of new<br>
mammalian species. But at a recent meeting of the American Geo-<br>
physical Union in Baltimore (MD US), John Alroy (Smithsonian<br>
Institution, US) presented the results of an extensive analysis<br>
of the fossil and climatic record and showed that the expected<br>
correlation between the emergence of new mammalian species is<br>
weak rather than strong, and that the data suggest evolutionary<br>
spurts during periods of reduced extant species, for example that<br>
following what is called "the great impact" of 65 million years<br>
ago. Alroy's work apparently impressed the assembled paleo-<br>
biologists. (Science 27 June)<br>
<p>
SECOND HUMAN ANTIBIOTIC ISOLATED FROM SKIN<br>
Although endogenous antibiotic peptides exist in both plant and<br>
animal species, it is only recently (1995) that an endogenous<br>
antibiotic has been isolated in humans (hBD-1). Now J. Harder et<br>
al (University of Kiel, DE) report the identification and<br>
isolation of a second human endogenous antibiotic peptide, named<br>
hBD-2, relative molecular mass 4000, of the protein rubric beta-<br>
defensin. This new peptide is an inducible, transcriptionally<br>
regulated antibiotic peptide resembling those in other mammals.<br>
Human skin apparently contains a chemical shield of endogenous<br>
peptide antibiotics induced by contact with microorganisms. The<br>
authors suggest that human peptide antibiotics might be ideal<br>
therapeutic agents to counteract problems of acquired microbial<br>
resistance. (Nature 26 June)<br>
<p>
NEW EVIDENCE FOR POTASSIUM CHANNEL REGULATION IN NEURON DENDRITES<br>
The electrical activity of nerve cells in all species is<br>
essentially controlled by the movements of ions, particularly<br>
sodium, potassium, and calcium ions, across nerve cell membranes.<br>
Some nerve cells, especially those in the mammalian brain, have a<br>
complicated architecture, with extensive branching into dendrites<br>
that receive input from other nerve cells. The broad picture of<br>
ion movements in nerve cell axons (the output extensions of nerve<br>
cells) is rather well-known, but the ion movements in dendrites<br>
are less understood because of experimental difficulties. Now Dax<br>
A. Hoffman et al (Baylor College of Medicine, TX US) have<br>
reported a study of potassium ion regulation in a type of nerve<br>
cell in a part of the brain called the hippocampus. The<br>
experiments involved tissue slices of the rat brain, a standard<br>
technique for studying mammalian brain electrical activity. At<br>
the present time, it is axiomatic that all mammalian neurons<br>
exhibit the same general ion dynamics, which means studies of<br>
neurons of the rat brain can be revelatory for our understanding<br>
of neurons of the human brain. Hoffman and his group found a high<br>
density of transient potassium ion channels in the dendrites of<br>
the neurons they studied. They present an analysis of how these<br>
channels regulate the responsiveness of the studied neurons to<br>
input from other nerve cells. This new data will need to be<br>
considered by all neurobiologists interested in the functioning<br>
of human brain nerve cells. (Nature 26 June)<br>
<p>
FIRST IDENTIFICATION OF MOUSE OBESITY GENE IN HUMANS<br>
In 1994 an obesity gene and its protein product (leptin), were<br>
discovered in obese mice. It has been determined that a defect in<br>
the gene causes a severe reduction in the output of functional<br>
leptin by fat cells (adipocytes). Leptin apparently acts as a<br>
messenger to the hypothalamus in the brain, the absence of the<br>
protein causing excessive eating behavior without satiation. Now<br>
a similar gene has been discovered in humans, this gene also<br>
responsible for the production of leptin by human adipocytes.<br>
Carl T. Montague et al (15 authors at various installations, UK)<br>
studied a homozygous genetic defect in two children suffering<br>
from extreme obesity, and have isolated and characterized the<br>
gene, and related it to the previously identified mouse gene<br>
known as ob/ob. As in mice, the result of a defect in the gene is<br>
an order of magnitude reduction in the circulating blood<br>
concentration of the protein leptin. The results do not mean that<br>
all instances of obesity in humans are produced by defects in<br>
this gene, but certainly a new area of research into the<br>
molecular genetics of human obesity has now been defined. In<br>
addition, the authors offer the hope that recombinant human<br>
leptin may be found to correct leptin deficiency in clinical<br>
cases. (Nature 26 June)<br>
<p>
DISCOVERY OF GENE IMPLICATED IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE<br>
Defects in the structure of the protein alpha-synuclein have been<br>
implicated in several human brain pathologies, including<br>
Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeld-Jacob disease. Now a specific<br>
type of familial, early-onset Parkinson's disease has been added<br>
to the list. Mihael H. Polymeropoulos (20 authors at various<br>
installations, US, IT, GR) have identified a mutation in the<br>
alpha-synuclein gene in three unrelated families of Greek origin<br>
exhibiting inherited early-onset Parkinsonism. A consensus is<br>
growing that defects in the structure of alpha-synuclein may be<br>
responsible for an array of human brain pathologies, with at<br>
least some of the protein structural defects caused by inherited<br>
genetic mutations. Alpha-synuclein has been previously shown to<br>
be a presynaptic nerve terminal protein. The early visible<br>
symptoms of Parkinsonism are produced by destruction of nerve<br>
cells producing the hormone dopamine. In later stages of the<br>
disease, destruction of other types of nerve cells occurs. This<br>
new study does not provide evidence for a genetic basis for all<br>
cases of Parkinsonism, but it serves as a pointer for researchers<br>
studying the molecular biology of the disease. (Science 27 June)<br>
<p>
NEW STUDY REFUTES CONNECTION BETWEEN MAGNETIC FIELDS AND CANCER<br>
Eighteen years ago, two researchers in Denver (CO US) noticed<br>
small clusters of childhood leukemia cases (acute lymphoblastic<br>
leukemia) and published a report in a medical journal relating<br>
these cases to the presence of high-voltage power lines near the<br>
childrens' residences, ascribing the relationship to the effects<br>
of electrically induced magnetic fields on human tissue.<br>
Although such magnetic fields can be shown by physical analysis<br>
to be insignificant, much smaller than the already present steady<br>
magnetic field of the Earth itself, amplification of concern by<br>
the international media resulted in a near panic in many<br>
countries. What is ironic is that in the first study, and in<br>
later studies which claimed positive results, magnetic fields<br>
were never measured, but were "estimated" using varying criteria.<br>
In addition, the number of cases studied was always small, and<br>
adequate controls were often nonexistent. Nevertheless, the<br>
public concern increased, partly due to a three-part series in<br>
the magazine New Yorker that claimed collusion by industry and<br>
government in preventing dissemination of information about the<br>
"true" state of affairs. Both physicists and physicians cognizant<br>
of physics always denied the validity of the claims of a<br>
relationship, and a number of studies with negative results were<br>
carried out. Now the largest and most carefully controlled study<br>
ever undertaken of this alleged relationship, a study involving<br>
638 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 620 controls,<br>
with actual physical measurements of magnetic fields by<br>
technicians blinded to the cases and controls, has revealed no<br>
connection at all between measured magnetic fields and diagnosis<br>
of childhood leukemia. Results of the new study were reported<br>
this week by Martha S. Linet et al (various installations in the<br>
US). (New England Journal of Medicine 3 July)<br>
<p>
MAGNETIC FIELD STUDIES CALLED WASTE OF PUBLIC FUNDS<br>
In an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine,<br>
commenting on the results reported above, and the international<br>
near hysteria that has existed for almost two decades over the<br>
possibility that magnetic fields induced by power lines cause<br>
cancer, Edward W. Campion says, "It is sad that hundreds of<br>
millions of dollars have gone into studies that never had much<br>
promise of finding a way to prevent the tragedy of cancer in<br>
children." (New England Journal of Medicine 3 July)<br>
<p>
A DANGEROUS SHORTAGE OF INTRAVENOUS MULTIVITAMIN SOLUTIONS<br>
Vitamins are chemical substances not produced by the body, but<br>
which are essential for many physiological processes. Vitamins<br>
must therefore be taken into the body by one route or another.<br>
Some vitamins, such as thiamine (Vitamin B1), are not stored by<br>
the body, and the input, usually through the diet, must occur<br>
almost every day. Reduction of thiamine levels produces insidious<br>
results, the most notorious of which is perhaps the symptoms of<br>
the neurological disease known as beriberi. Ordinarily, the input<br>
of thiamine and other vitamins is a simple matter of an adequate<br>
diet, but patients with digestion problems, adults and neonates,<br>
particularly those with "short bowels" following gastrointestinal<br>
surgery, often need intravenous vitamin administration. In this<br>
week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine there are<br>
three letters addressing the apparent severe shortage of<br>
intravenous vitamin solution in the U.S. and other countries.<br>
Intravenous vitamin solution is an elementary chemical production<br>
entity, but evidently there are only two suppliers in the U.S.,<br>
production for some reason stopped at the end of 1996, and<br>
intravenous vitamin solution is now almost impossible to obtain<br>
anywhere. The problem is stated in a letter by M. Alloju and M.<br>
Ehrinpreis (Wayne State University, US). In a second letter,<br>
Astra USA, one of the suppliers, says they had design and<br>
engineering problems with new equipment. In a third letter,<br>
Kenneth A. Kudsk et al (American Society for Parenteral and<br>
Enteral Nutrition, MD US) say they have no adequate explanation<br>
for the duration and severity of the shortage. They also state<br>
they know of 22 present cases of thiamine deficiency in patients<br>
receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition, and that in 1988,<br>
at the time of another shortage of intravenous multivitamins,<br>
"several deaths resulted from cardiac failure due to thiamine-<br>
deficient total parenteral nutrition among patients within a few<br>
weeks of not receiving vitamins." (New England Journal of<br>
Medicine 3 July)<br>
