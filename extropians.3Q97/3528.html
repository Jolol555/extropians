Hi!<br>

I'm no zoologist, I'm graduating in Microbiology and, as far as I know,<br>
adding cryoprotectants (glycerol or dimethylsulfoxide mostly) is<br>
necessary to preserve microorganisms at very low temperatures. They act<br>
by preventing the formation of water crystals.<br>
There are indeed complex species (such as some frogs) that can survive<br>
freezing, they do so by producing a cryoprotectant and then spreading it<br>
through the body.<br>
Our case is much different, first because we are obviously much more<br>
complex than any microorganism or even than a frog. Second because the<br>
cryoprotective agent certainly acts differently in our different types<br>
of cells, remember that the frog is 'designed' by Mother Nature to<br>
survive at lower temperatures and therefore it's cells are certainly<br>
much better adapted than ours independently of the cryoprotective agent.<br>
Finally, all I remember is reading at least one study (yes, I'll try to<br>
find the authors) in which animal brains were frizzed using the same<br>
procedure of cryonics and severe brain damage was observed (see 'How and<br>
Why We Age' page 300-301, I know Hayflick is too pessimistic but I agree<br>
with him on this subject). I can find a million of explanations for the<br>
observed brain damage but what I think is the main point is that current<br>
(I don't know how will they be in the future) cryonics does severely<br>
damage the brain, possibly (as far as I know no-one knows for sure)<br>
beyond repair.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do you intend to still have a genome in 1000 years.  I don't.  I'll have</i><br>
<i>&gt; had all the kids I want to by then, so why else would I need one?  If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't like the flawed human genome, get rid of it!  Think about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; advancements that have occurred in the last 50 years... now think what we</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be able to do 1000 years from now.  Getting rid of the genome will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; trivial.  This is in essence what "uploading" is, I suggest you do some</i><br>
<i>&gt; research.  There is already a multitude of nascent strategies for</i><br>
<i>&gt; uploading the human mind. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   All this would be irrelevant to you if you think the genome is necessary</i><br>
<i>&gt; for consciousness- but, again, give me some evidence.</i><br>
<p>
I'll be honest with you, I don't know what uploading is, I think is the<br>
transfer of human consciousness to, say, a computer but that part of<br>
extropism never really called much attention from me. My object of<br>
preservation are my neurons or, specifically, my brain. If I lose my<br>
brain, even that there is a computer with an exact copy of my feelings,<br>
emotions, thoughts, etc, I'll die. Therefore to survive I need to<br>
preserve my brain, probably my body and for that I'll need to maintain a<br>
genome, I can't get rid of my genes.<br>
As for evidence, well it's more of a philosophical, theoretical problem<br>
rather than a biological one. See the few cases I placed in my last two<br>
messages and you'll know what I mean. Personally, I believe (and notice<br>
the verb to believe instead of the usual verb to think) that I'm my<br>
brain and that is my conscience.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why are you placing all your bets on aging research?  This seems overly</i><br>
<i>&gt; risky :(</i><br>
<p>
What other options do I have? Cryopreservation? Uploading (what is it<br>
exactly?)?<br>

<i> &gt;and even if the chance that it works is 0.000000001 %</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
Arjen Kamphuis basically already answered this question but I also would<br>
like to add that on a personal basis I'm not a millionaire and therefore<br>
if I died I would probably prefer to ensure a good life for my children<br>
(no, I don't have any children but let's suppose I have when I die)<br>
instead of spending my money on something that most likely won't work.<br>
<p>
Besides, I'm alive and until I reach the very end I'll try to solve the<br>
aging problem. When I see death before my eyes I'll think of short-term<br>
options such as cryonics but until then, I'll work on life extension and<br>
aging research.<br>
<p>
I wrote another message but since it's not directly related to cryonics<br>
I decided to send two separate messages.<br>
<p>
Thank you for your replies,<br>
