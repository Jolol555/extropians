I came across a very imaginative 'nanotech' science fiction book the<br>
other day in a used bookstore (it was written in 1988!).<br>
<p>
Here are some passages:<br>
<p>
'My name is Leticia Shafae, and I am an immortal goddess fabricating<br>
this vision aboard my plush private cabin in high orbit.  Looking out<br>
my cabin window I can see the great marbled orb from which I emerged<br>
spinning below, and the holographic logos of Nanotech, inc and<br>
MickyBunny Enterprises shimmering in space…I occupy the perfect<br>
vehical…and it is fully equipped with a remarkably exotic and wildly<br>
erotic nervous system, which I have learned to use quite well…With my<br>
new multi-modular fiber optic nervous system, biological immortality,<br>
and the high degree of neurological sophistication that I have<br>
attained, I am (from your perspective) a supernatural being…'<br>
<p>
After re-animation from a 100 year cryonic freeze she awakens to a<br>
world of fully mature nanotech:<br>
<p>
'When I awoke I looked around and was astonished by what I saw.<br>
Everything at completely changed. It seemed as though I was inside a<br>
computer animation, Escheresque forms grew out of the walls and<br>
transformed into other impossible forms before my eyes.  Tiny winged<br>
pixie creatures fluttered through the air.  Strange technological<br>
devices,  whose function I could not even fathom, grew and squiggled<br>
out of the walls, with a smooth polished supernatural radiance and a<br>
glimmering unreal perfection.  I realized the room and everything in<br>
it, was in continual transformation.'<br>
<p>
'When Daimon suggested that I have a new, flexible, more powerful,<br>
fiber-optic nervous system installed in my body, I was intrigued.  One<br>
merely had a solution of nanomachines injected into ones<br>
bloodstream…the whole process took about 15 minutes…If one wished it<br>
was just as easy to change one's physical charcteristics or sex,<br>
simply by commanding a fleet of nanomachines to push in unison the<br>
desired sequence of DNA keys.  Biomorphic structure had become as<br>
pliable as silly putty.'<br>
<p>
'Ergotica, the largest, and most spectacular of the high orbital space<br>
cities, was essential an anti-planet; a nanotechnolgically fabricated<br>
human hive…Ergotica had achieved a most striking blend of natural<br>
environments and high technology…cuddly furry mountains, redwoods, and<br>
organic streamlined structures that baffled a gravity-soaked brain<br>
like mine…Concepts like up/down floor/ceiling were completely<br>
obsolete…Freedom from gravity allowed for relativistic architectural<br>
design.  Best of all their were no flies, ticks or mosquitoes!…The<br>
sight was magnificent, like staring into the face of infinity…all<br>
around was a vast network of pyramidical/polyhedrons interconnected by<br>
tubular structures superimposed upon a spherical sea of rolling<br>
mountains and forrests.'<br>
<p>
'And so I float here in this ultra-plush cabin, carpeted with rolling<br>
mounds of undulating genetically fabricated flesh, woven together<br>
within a patchwork of living twisting human tongues…'<br>
<p>
The book is called 'Brainchild' by David Jay Brown and published by<br>
New Falcon Press.  Its still in print.<br>
