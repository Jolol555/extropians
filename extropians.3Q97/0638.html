<p>
Corporate downsizing is not much of a data point, because it tends<br>
to be balanced by growth in smaller businesses, though this is much<br>
less remarked upon in the media simply because the growth in smaller<br>
businesses is less obviously visible. But downsizing is usually<br>
coupled with outsourcing (more business for the smaller<br>
businesses) and hiring of contractors (more business for people<br>
like me).<br>
<p>
What most of the high-paying jobs have in common is that the worker<br>
is producing valuable information: a film, a legal brief, a song,<br>
a computer program, an accounting analysis, experimental results,<br>
a summary of research in some field, etc. There are an awful lot<br>
of growth niches here that are not going to be automated any time<br>
soon, and I think that perhaps our biggest problem is educational<br>
systems that assume that most people are not fit for such jobs. I<br>
suspect that the educational institutions in most countries of the<br>
world need to be shaken up rather severely... I'd like to see a<br>
lot more experimentation and a lot less regimentation going on in<br>
the education industry than currently seems to be the case.<br>
