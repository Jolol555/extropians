There seems to be a lively discussion of "truth maintenance" going on,<br>
but did anyone answer the original question about the original AI<br>
meaning of the term?<br>
<p>
"Truth Maintenance," as I recall, was a combination of ideas about<br>
constraints, nonmonotonic logic, and versioning databases as in Conniver.<br>
The original papers would be listed in the MIT AI Lab publications<br>
list (this is a great catalog to have and order from!) from the '70s.<br>
<p>
The idea was to have a system that would maintain consistency of its<br>
database of beliefs, given constraints among assertions (e.g., if X is a<br>
bird, X normally has wings), current incomplete knowledge, hypotheses,<br>
and changes to what is known.  It would be able to "imagine" (my word)<br>
specified possibilities (what if X had no wings?) and their consequences,<br>
and absorb new information, deriving its consequences, including<br>
contradiction with what was assumed based on default rules (hmm, then how<br>
did X get in here?).  The "Truth" that was being maintained was probably<br>
the truth or falsehood of different assertions in hypothetical and/or<br>
changing "worlds" (=versions or views) in the database.  Making sure<br>
all the switches get switched right.<br>
