In a message dated 97-09-08 22:52:46 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Marvin Minsky and Eric Drexler both finally signed up, and that makes me<br>
 feel better.  But I'm sure each of you can think of countless intellectual<br>
 influences whose cryonics membership status is non-existent or unknown. <br>
 What can we do about it, if anything?<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Instead of cryonics, I have full faith in that we will develop technologies<br>
to extend our lives forever, within the near future.<br>
