First, a moment of brief self-introduction.  I go by the name<br>
Richard Plourde, work as an electronics design consultant (mostly<br>
developing exotic measurement instrumentation), philosophically<br>
would probably get classified as an Epicurean, enjoy blue water<br>
sailing, and come to this list by way of a posting on the nonserve<br>
list (a list dedicated to the anti-mystical philosophy of Max<br>
Stirner).  My evaluative approaches will probably reflect training<br>
in general-semantics.<br>
<p>
I note that 'problem,' in this context, represents an evaluation,<br>
not something measurable as a fact.  Sometimes we neglect the<br>
evaluative part of 'problem' and treat 'problem' as if it were a<br>
fact.  That generally occurs with consensus, as in when we call<br>
cancer 'a problem.'  Consensus has limited reliability -- everyone<br>
considering the world 'flat', for example, does not make the world<br>
flat.  But, in this specific instance, we clearly do not have<br>
consensus, so we need not look too closely at the traps of<br>
consensus.  Instead, we can look at underlying relationships.<br>
<p>
Some people adapt to change quite well -- indeed, some people seem<br>
to thrive on rapid change, gain great pleasure from it, and<br>
experience other benefits (possibly related to the gradually<br>
increasing life-span in advanced technology regions) that come<br>
from the process of change.<br>
<p>
Yet many people do not adapt to change, and experience discomfort<br>
(strengthened neuroses, poverty, premature death, etc.) in the<br>
face of rapid change.<br>
<p>
No matter *how* we look at 'problem', it seems as though "pace of<br>
change" can represent only a factor, and not "the problem."  A<br>
consensus on cancer makes some sense;  off-hand, I can think of no<br>
one who considers cancer advantageous.  An evaluation of "pace of<br>
change" as a problem, on the other hand, has many counter<br>
examples.<br>
<p>
I think that, to explain why some people would consider a rapid<br>
"pace of change" to represent "a problem," and why other people<br>
would consider it "a solution," we have to look to factors beyond<br>
change itself.  Individual adaptability can account, at least in<br>
large part, for the differences.  <br>
<p>
I claim that we can probably verify a high degree of empirical<br>
correlation with the assertions:<br>
<p>
"Rapid change" + "adaptability" -&gt; effectiveness + joy<br>
"Rapid change" + "rigidity" -&gt; ineffectiveness + depression<br>
<p>
Such an analysis, where adaptability and rigidity count more than<br>
"rapid change" may not get accepted easily.  Recognizing<br>
adaptability as a kind of evaluational pivot may represent a shift<br>
in responsibility that many people, particularly those who (for<br>
reasons I do not begin to comprehend) avoid recognition of their<br>
own powers, will not easily accept.<br>
