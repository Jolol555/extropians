Michael Lorrey took the liberty of forwarding email from Ian<br>
Cruikshank to the list.  The most remarkable thing to me is that<br>
Mr. Cruikshank spends so much time denouncing a phenomenon he has<br>
clearly spent very little time studying.  Just in case his rant<br>
raised unpleasant questions in the minds of some people new to the<br>
list, I want to pick out and correct a few of his grosser misstatements.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ACQUISITIVENESS: extropians affirm the right of infinite property</i><br>
<i>&gt; accumulation (e.g. Bill Gates).</i><br>
<p>
Considering that nearly all of the observable cosmos seems to<br>
consist of unclaimed homesteadable stuff, I personally don't have<br>
a problem with infinite property accumulation.  But Bill Gates is<br>
a poor example, since a significant minority of extropians thoroughly<br>
disapprove of the means by which Gates accumulated his wealth.  If<br>
we go back to the open letter Gates published in the mid-1970s<br>
pleading for an end to the "piracy" of his BASIC software (a letter<br>
which ended up shaping subsequent thinking, and thereby, subsequent<br>
legal argument about intellectual property in software) we find a<br>
number of dogmatic assertions which are hard to square with most<br>
of the theories of anarchocapitalism and polycentric law that I've<br>
seen defended here and in other extropian publications.<br>
<p>
Cruikshank here commits the same sort of mistake he commits elsewhere:<br>
he asserts uniformity and unanimity within extropian thought which<br>
simply does not exist.  The areas in which extropian thought *does*<br>
seem to be fairly uniform and unanimous are precisely those in<br>
which Cruikshank himself agrees with us (except perhaps his disbelief<br>
in the second law of thermodynamics).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; COLLUSION: most also affirm that corporations should exist and enjoy</i><br>
<i>&gt; "limited liability" and be treated as a "single person".</i><br>
<p>
Current guarantees of limited liability for corporations have been<br>
debated on this list and in other forums more specifically dedicated<br>
to hammering out the finer points of agorist legal theory.  I<br>
personally am skeptical about the possibility of securing limited<br>
liability for the owners of corporate entities in the absence of<br>
an authoritarian state.  Whether or not corporations (or sewing<br>
circles or go clubs) "should exist" is a question of concern only<br>
to those poeople who form the corporation (or sewing circle or go<br>
club)... I can't imagine how anyone calling himself an "anarchist"<br>
could possibly argue otherwise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; TERRITORIALITY/CLANNISHNESS: extropians advocate creating your own</i><br>
<i>&gt; utopia of sorts, by only associating with people who share your</i><br>
<i>&gt; values and pursuits. </i><br>
<p>
This part is right.  What, does Cruikshank really wish to be *forced*<br>
to associate with people who do not share his own values and<br>
pursuits? Is Cruikshank begging and pleading to be locked in a pit<br>
full of ravening extropians?<br>
<p>
Of course we can learn a great deal by associating with people who<br>
do not share our own values.  But since extropians are still rather<br>
rare, most of us experience the questionable pleasures of such<br>
learning experiences on a daily basis.  And when we get together<br>
and talk about the stuff that interests us, instead of football<br>
and McDonald's and how to better prevent people from taking incorrect<br>
drugs, do we therefore necessarily...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I.e., deny the existence of starving, sick, dying people world-wide, </i><br>
<p>
To turn Cruikshank's "argument" against him, the same "logic"<br>
indicates that Cruikshank's refusal to be thrust into the pit of<br>
ravening extropians mentioned above would likewise constitute a<br>
denial of the existence of starving, sick, and dying people worldwide.<br>
Just a tad bit incoherent on the segue here.  Fortunately, as long<br>
as Cruikshank continues to argue against freedom of association,<br>
not many people are going to listen to him for very long.  Freedom<br>
of association is as beneficial to the unlucky as it is the fortunate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; SECRECY: extropians affirm cryptography as a means to allow</i><br>
<i>&gt; unaccountable agents (accountable at most only to each other) to</i><br>
<i>&gt; continue to squander the resources of this world for their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; selfish enrichment.</i><br>
<p>
In the first four words, he has it right, although even here there<br>
is no unanimity, since I have see well-reasoned arguments on this<br>
list in favor of "transparency" over the long term future.  His<br>
assertions about the motivations for extropians supporting cryptography<br>
miss many different points: that encrypting ones speech is a form<br>
of free speech, that privacy and security in ones personal effects<br>
(as guaranteed in the US Fourth Amendment) is a vital protection<br>
against the sort of tyranny that Cruikshank claims to be working<br>
so hard against, and others.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; SELFISHNESS: extropians affirm "me-first, me-last, me-only."</i><br>
<i>&gt; me, me, me. they talk the jive of "personal responsibility", another</i><br>
<i>&gt; coded way of saying "no such thing as a free lunch", another of</i><br>
<i>&gt; their pet dogmas which they ascribe as "laws of nature", for of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course they represent the "voice of nature", or so they think.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I don't see much evidence for this claim at all.  Given<br>
that the problem of distinguishing self from other in a reliable<br>
way is recognized by many (not all) as a very deep problem in<br>
philosophy and computer science, and given that since most extropians<br>
are deeply convinced that the implementation of their ideas would<br>
improve things for nearly everyone on the planet (e. g. those who<br>
agree with Julian Simon), one could just as reasonably argue that<br>
extropians are deeply altruistic, since they spend an unconscionable<br>
amount of time studying all kinds of painfully abstract disciplines<br>
and talking about how the systems we find in the world might be<br>
improved for the benefit of all.<br>
<p>
Then come the slams on the second law of thermodynamics, which<br>
Cruikshank seems not to have studied, since this is hardly a physical<br>
law at all, but nearly a mathematical one applying to diverse<br>
cellular automata ranging from the very simple to ones as rich and<br>
complex as the particles and fields of our own cosmos.  Of course,<br>
it only applies to *closed* systems... like Cruikshank's mind.<br>
<p>
(Yes, that last bit *was* an ad hominem... you needn't point it<br>
out to me.  Stop being so puritanical and allow me my sinful<br>
pleasures.)<br>
