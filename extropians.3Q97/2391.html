<p>
&lt;&lt;  As for your 'obvious fact' above, I <br>
 would ask that you provide some definite support for that statement, <br>
 outside of your personal experience, in order to consider it a <br>
 general truism.   &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
My experience as a kid was that we were like packs of wild dogs...when adults<br>
werent around...the baddest dog was boss.  <br>
<p>
Of course that might not be what you ment by definite support...seeing as how<br>
I only lived it and had no government study to coorobate it's existence.  Or<br>
maybe I lived in the wrong textbook...a different one from the one that<br>
teaches "whole reading' I bet.<br>
