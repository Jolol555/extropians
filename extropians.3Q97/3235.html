<p>
It hasn't lowered my estimation of you.  There is no sign that anyone else has<br>
judged against you.  In fact, this message prompted a chorus of forgiveness. <br>
The experimental evidence seems to be against your assertion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can only repeat the apology to Paul which I posted last night, and say</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I am considering unsubscribing from the list as the only other course</i><br>
<i>&gt; of action open to me at this time. Perhaps it is, after all, that most</i><br>
<i>&gt; human of traits, emotion, which will stop our breaking the boundaries which</i><br>
<i>&gt; limit us at this time.</i><br>
<p>
Saying nasty things about people shouldn't generate this level of remorse,<br>
unless superhuman self-restraint and/or mercy form a large part of your<br>
perceived self-image.  If you'd mailbombed him, that'd be another matter.  In<br>
general, ill-chosen words require apologies on the verbal level, of the same<br>
intensity as the ill-chosen words themselves.  Words can be a form of action,<br>
injuring their target, but in this particular case that isn't so.  All things<br>
considered, unsubscribing from the List would be an overreaction.<br>
<p>
Such excruciatingly high standards might drive out our current, forgiving<br>
standards, making newcomers more nervous about joining.  So you HAVE to stay. <br>
In fact, you should apologize for trying to leave.  (*)<br>

(*) = No, I'm not serious, but this approach has been known to work on a
friend of mine who also apologizes too much.
