It was with some trepidation that I posted my earlier mssgs.  <br>
<p>
In times past...(going on about 35 yrs) those and similar ideas have been<br>
repeatedly and viciously attacked.  And not just the ideas... I was<br>
personally verbally maligned as well...  ..In the seventies while on Crete<br>
with the USAF I was known as "The Anarchist"...which didn't bother me until I<br>
realized that it was intended as an insult.<br>
<p>
Yet here I hear nary a murmur of dissent!  My ideas are even<br>
supported!!..with facts and commentary of which I was unaware.<br>
<p>
Have I ,at long last...found an ideological home?<br>
