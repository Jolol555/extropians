Nigel Jacob wrote 7/25/97: &lt;It is my contention that the notion of a<br>
physical Frontier to be explored, settled, tamed, understood etc. is<br>
central in determining whether or not humanity (either en masse, or<br>
individually) can "evolve", in any meaningful use of that term. Thus, I a=<br>
m<br>
curious as to whether or not any of you think that extropianism can succe=<br>
ed<br>
as a movement within the confines of a society without an accessable<br>
Frontier.  Is it likely that extropianism, or any phenomological decenden=<br>
t<br>
of such, can truly take hold within this society? And if so, do we risk<br>
becoming a subculture?&gt;<br>
<p>
Anders Sandberg mentioned frontiers of space and the Net, there are other=<br>
<p>
formulations of "frontier" floating around in the conceptual stew.  There=<br>
<p>
are many books characterizing science and technological development as<br>
"frontiers of knowledge."  There are "spiritual frontiers" cropping up on=<br>
<p>
various web sites (e.g., www1.sony.co.jp/kurokawa - "I feel that the time=<br>
<p>
has come for us to venture into the frontier of the spirit which stretche=<br>
s<br>
broadly on all sides at the fringes of our established rules and<br>
standards").  There are "frontiers of the heart" (see Michael Malone's<br>
article in "Forbes ASAP" of 12/2/96).  There are "frontiers of art," see<br>
Natasha More's "Extropic Art Manifesto" or A.N. Whitehead's observation: =<br>
<p>
"The human body is an instrument for the production of art in the life of=<br>
<p>
the human soul.  It unlooses depths of feeling from behind the frontier<br>
where precision of consciousness fails."  There is an extropic need to<br>
complexify both ourselves and the outside world in order to open wide the=<br>
<p>
metaphysical space between them, a frontier, for discoveries both<br>
scientific and artistic.<br>
<p>
There is a recent history of viewing physical frontiers as promoting virt=<br>
ue<br>
or redemption through various forms of imperialism, whether earlier<br>
colonialism or later global "running-dog" capitalist.  John Ruskin in 187=<br>
8<br>
was very influential in promoting the British mission to expand into the<br>
frontier of less virtuous peoples, quite similar to American "Manifest<br>
Destiny."  Frederick Turner's essay "The Significance of the Frontier in<br>
American History" (1893) argued that since the closure of the frontier in=<br>
<p>
America (the claiming of the Cherokee Strip in 1889), opportunities for<br>
growth and self-renewal would be shut off, leading to decadence.  Turner<br>
held that the frontier experience was central to America's character, "th=<br>
e<br>
meeting point between savagery and civilization."  In other words, an<br>
extropic arena of vitality.  From about 1900 onwards, America's political=<br>
<p>
elite has looked to the Pacific and Asia for frontier-like expansion,<br>
always westward, although they have been frequently frustrated by the<br>
well-armed foreigners in their way.  This will continue.<br>
<p>
Speaking of extropic arenas of vitality, some hold that cyberspace will<br>
eventually have many jurisdictions, rather than One World Government. =<br>
<p>
These jurisdictions will act much like the medieval frontiers or marches,=<br>
<p>
where sovereignties overlapped and jostled.  In these frontier areas,<br>
before statism took solid root, institutional and legal forms developed<br>
that approximated what "competitive" polycentric government might look li=<br>
ke<br>
(see "Medieval Frontier Societies" (1992) eds. Robert Bennett and Angus<br>
MacKay).<br>
<p>
Frontiers are not "goals," a frequent misapplication of the term, they ar=<br>
e<br>
boundaries.  They are really physical, meaning spatial, or rather<br>
territorial.  Any use of the word "frontier" outside of this meaning is<br>
only metaphorical.<br>
<p>
The frontier mentality cannot be purged from humanity, no matter how fill=<br>
ed<br>
the earth becomes.  An evolutionary search in fitness space will continue=<br>
,<br>
not much different from probes at the ends of tentacles of primitive<br>
one-celled animals.  Get out!  Move!  Get away!  Find sustenance! =<br>
<p>
Imperative!<br>
<p>
It is human nature to be plagued by major cross-purposes:  to be differen=<br>
t<br>
*and* to be similar, or as I put it in my history paper on the ExI websit=<br>
e,<br>
"Life is a struggle between seeking and avoiding surprise."  Cultural<br>
speciation precedes human speciation.  Cultural speciation is, by<br>
definition, the formation of sub-cultures.  So becoming a sub-culture is<br>
hardly a "risk," it is the extropic aim.  The idea of a unity of humanity=<br>
,<br>
a single global culture, makes us itchy.  We are too hemmed in here.  We<br>
are like restless ants, and our restlessness is ratcheting up.  Space is<br>
only real physical frontier to escape the World Surveillance State.<br>
<p>
Absent a frontier, absent space to dream in, and move in, humanity implod=<br>
es<br>
into a stagant dogmatic sinkhole.  From the experience of the Crusades as=<br>
<p>
overcoming limits, to the proto-spirituality of the Chartres Cathedral an=<br>
d<br>
the epoch of Scholasticism, to the Protestant Revolution and the scientif=<br>
ic<br>
enterprise it spawned; it has been *Space* (or Extension), that was place=<br>
d<br>
at the pinnacle of spirituality.  Our true longing, to expand and grow, o=<br>
ur<br>
pioneer spirit that took us from medieval Paris westward through the<br>
wilderness to the Oregon Territory, is to leave earth physically and<br>
explore outer space.<br>
<p>
Short of being able to do this, we are reaching out to create and then ta=<br>
me<br>
the wilderness of cyberspace.  Cyberspace, after all the media hype is<br>
boiled down, is simply a temporary stopover, a holding pattern, until our=<br>
<p>
technology advances further into real space.  The impetus we have to delv=<br>
e<br>
into cyberspace is the same impetus we had in Chartres Cathedral, a plung=<br>
e<br>
into cyberspace can invoke the same feelings as looking up through those<br>
high windows in Chartres.  The same individuals who would call Chartres '=<br>
a<br>
pile of rocks,' would call a Ferrari a 'rolling hunk of metal,' and<br>
cyberspace mere 'electrons on a phosphor screen.'  Such minds are staring=<br>
<p>
fixedly at the mud.  We turn and look at the stars, the infinite frontier=<br>
