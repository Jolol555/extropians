Here is a quote which gives the rudiments of Smolin's idea about natural<br>
selection of universes:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "The other idea with which Smolin is associated is "natural selection"</i><br>
<i>&gt; of universes. He's saying that in some sense the universes that allow</i><br>
<i>&gt; complexity and evolution reproduce themselves more efficiently than</i><br>
<i>&gt; other universes. The ensemble itself is thus evolving in some complicated</i><br>
<i>&gt; way. When stars die, they sometimes form black holes. (This is something</i><br>
<i>&gt; which I wear my astrophysical hat to study.) Smolin speculates (as others,</i><br>
<i>&gt; like Alan Guth, have also done) that inside a black hole it's possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; for a small region to, as it were, sprout into a new universe. We don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; see it, but it inflates into some new dimension. Smolin takes that idea</i><br>
<i>&gt; on board, but then introduces another conjecture, which is that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; laws of nature in the new universe are related to those in the previous</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe. This differs from Andrei Linde's idea of a random ensemble,</i><br>
<i>&gt; because Smolin supposes that the new universe retains physical laws</i><br>
<i>&gt; not too different from its parent universe. What that would mean is</i><br>
<i>&gt; that universes big and complex enough to allow stars to form, evolve,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and die, and which can therefore produce lots of black holes, would have</i><br>
<i>&gt; more progeny, because each black hole can then lead to a new universe;</i><br>
<i>&gt; whereas a universe that didn't allow stars and black holes to form would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have no progeny.  Therefore Smolin claims that the ensemble of universes</i><br>
<i>&gt; may evolve not randomly but by some Darwinian selection, in favor of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the potentially complex universes."</i><br>
<p>

<p>
If we wanted to extend this in an Extropian direction, we might assume that<br>
a universe which allows the formation of intelligent life will produce an<br>
extra-large number of progeny thanks to the intervention of those life forms.<br>
There are, however, some problems with this idea.  Why create unpopulated<br>
universes?.<br>
