Please, Sarah, we need you on this list. Let's consider this<br>
episode as an experiment in simulated "gray goo." Our technology<br>
has unintentionally run amok. We now need to preserve our little<br>
virtual world. It'll take awhile for our new immune system to be<br>
designed and implemented, and to take effect,  but let's not let<br>
the secondary effects of the attack destroy us.<br>
