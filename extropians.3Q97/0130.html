<i>&gt; From: Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@tpk.net&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Extinguishing them *might* be more ethical. I'm not sure.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Emminently more ethical. Give them the choice: execution or</i><br>
<i>&gt; reprogramming. Either way it is the end of that "individual". If a</i><br>
<i>&gt; person does not want to become a nice, polite, pliable cipher of</i><br>
<i>&gt; society, they should be able to choose the alternative.</i><br>
<p>
	It would seem that if an entity could be easily reprogrammed the<br>
technology would exist to make them a more complex, and considerably less<br>
easily reprogrammed, entity.  If the entity was considerably less complex<br>
than the party it offended, it could be easily swatted down.  Human level<br>
intelligence could simply be another being's mosquito.<br>
	The concept of individual in the post-human world is also likely to be<br>
rather malleable with high band width connections blurring the lines<br>
between where one begins and ends.  We already have an extremely good<br>
example of this with the brain.  Cut the corpus collosum (an extremely high<br>
bandwidth connection) and each side of the brain has to find out about the<br>
world with it's own half of the body.  Few people think about considering<br>
each half of the brain as separate individuals but they are, they just talk<br>
to each other really fast.<br>
	The offended parties in the post human world could link up, each<br>
contributing resources in proportion to the offense given.  They could then<br>
reduce the offending party to raw materials.  That is unless the offending<br>
party also had friends.  Obviously, violence is not going to work in every<br>
case.  Therefore, polycentric law will be applied.  It will actually be the<br>
only law that can be applied because data flow between entities is so high,<br>
they cannot help but know what each one's goals are (probably survival and<br>
therefore expansion, most everything else would probably be tossed).  This<br>
means that polycentric law will actually be more like agoric computing. <br>
One would not consider the relegation of a computer program hogging more<br>
resources than its worth to a lower priority slot, or even deleting it, as<br>
"capital punishment."  Executions, more properly prunings, in the<br>
post-biological world will probably be as dramatic, and necessary, as<br>
cutting one's toenails. <br>
