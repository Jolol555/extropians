<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Good questions. The papers I have read (see below) are a bit unclear</i><br>
<i>&gt; on this. My impression is that a high choline level biases some</i><br>
<i>&gt; reactions in favor for developing more receptors of certain kinds and</i><br>

<i>&gt; some kinds of memory are improved at the expense of others, but it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; hard to tell what would happen in humans.</i><br>
<p>
That being the case - I think that giving choline supplements to pregnant<br>
women is fine(*), but bearing in mind that the children will be Algernons.  In<br>
other words, you create a limited number instead of putting choline in the<br>
water supply.  As I said elsewhere, comparing humans to Algernons is futile,<br>
so the children won't be "worse" or "better" in any absolute terms.  But<br>
they'll be better off, having a better position in the supply-demand equation.<br>
 And from a wider perspective, it's best to have as many different types of<br>
human as possible.  The more types, the better the chance that any given<br>
problem will have a person capable of solving it.<br>
<p>
(Note that the issue of "informed consent" doesn't arise; you'd need that only<br>
if you were acting on preexisting persons.  Creating new people entirely falls<br>
under a totally different set of ethical laws.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Human memory is so mucky and fragile that we Information-Age types</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; use computers as "ontological stabilizers".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Shouldn't that be "epistemic stabilizers"?</i><br>
<p>
In the context of the conversation, I was claiming that human memory had a<br>
fuzzy ontological basis - wetware - while computers were founded on clear,<br>
unambiguous ones and zeroes.  In other words, it was an issue of substrate<br>
rather than distortion... hence the phrase; the implication was that the<br>
existence of information in clear and unchanging terms would stabilize the<br>
high-level wavering of the wetware through the Laws of Similarity and Contagion.<br>
