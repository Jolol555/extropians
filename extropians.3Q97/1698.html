     I'm developing this loose theory and wanted to run it by anyone <br>
     interested:<br>
     <br>
     Running roughly parallel to Chomsky's theory on universality of <br>
     language and ending up at St Ignatius de Loyola:<br>
     <br>
     Given that eidetic imaging has been found much more extensively in <br>
     children and given Chomsky's theory that children are born with some <br>
     kind of potential for language let's suppose:<br>
     <br>
     Our minds are constantly producing images. Whether we look at them or <br>
     not is a matter of choice.<br>
     How to look at them is a matter of choice and training.<br>
     Certain training and philosophies most definitely open our "inner <br>
     eyes" (massive quote marks - please note) to conscious perception of <br>
     these images. What interests me is the threshold at which these images <br>
     become eidetic (or at what point (subjective) I becomes eidetically <br>
     conscious). <br>
     <br>
     I don't know about you, but I find that my emotional reactions tend to <br>
     be in response to mental imagery. Is this "natural" or is it just <br>
     something I learnt to do from watching soap opera? In any case I find <br>
     that I react emotionally to mental images, (day)dreams rather than <br>
     formula's and concepts. My excitement at an inspiring concept comes as <br>
     soon as that concept becomes an image, my level of excitement is <br>
     directly linked to the clarity of the image. So the concept becomes <br>
     image by some as yet unclear mental process.<br>
     <br>
     It seems to me that imaging is a process of emotional sublimation. The <br>
     associated feelings are there but detached, still somehow active <br>
     within the mental image. Sublimated.<br>
     <br>
     For the sake of simplicity I'll borrow the left brain / right brain <br>
     model. I don't know or much care whether this theory is accurate, <br>
     measurable or has in fact been disproved. Let's postulate that left <br>
     brain means parameter setting, isolating metaphor and lexicon <br>
     juggling. Let's say that right brain means image generation from <br>
     emotional stimulation and pattern recognition. I say pattern RE - <br>
     COGNITION carefully.<br>
     <br>
     Right brain constantly produces images.<br>
     Left brain constantly "reads" these images, or tries to. <br>
     Left brain being what it is cannot process entire images which the <br>
     right brain deals with exclusively. So the left brain looks for <br>
     particular bytes it can articulate, usually simple comparisons. The <br>
     better the co-operation between left and right brain the more complex <br>
     a thought can be conjured. The left brain is scanning this <br>
     indescribable right brain image when suddenly a comparison model leaps <br>
     out - this is how we get metaphor. It is the bridge between image and <br>
     words, right and left. It's a lot like saying like, it's like, man, <br>
     you know, like wow.<br>
     <br>
     This would explain two things:<br>
     1. Children experience "eidetic" imaging more frequently simply <br>
     because their lexicon takes up less consciousness or computational <br>
     resources (cheers Anders!) than densely programmed adults. The hard <br>
     wiring of image processing without the software of particular <br>
     language. Even the comparative process impedes eidetic experience <br>
     (terms such as software to describe mental process). This hard wiring <br>
     of image processing may be a peek into animal consciousness.<br>
     2. The popularity of psychedelics. Augmenting image production or <br>
     inhibiting metaphor iconisation starts to look like pretty much the <br>
     same thing. (Now there's a debate)<br>
     <br>
     Things get interesting for me when looking at where our present (nano <br>
     and AI) technological development seems to be taking us: further into <br>
     the mind. It strikes me as a likely fantasy of coders (to coin Douglas <br>
     Coupland - microserfs) would be to jack into a global neural net and <br>
     depart the body. This fantasy often seems particularly resonant when <br>
     the neural net is a visual experience. "Shockwave" is an exciting <br>
     piece of software, isn't it? The fantasy strikes me as a wish to <br>
     revert to the mental landscape of childhood, to return to a reality <br>
     defined entirely by the flow of images and the play of imagination. <br>
     What I find interesting is that the attempt to actualise this desire <br>
     is enacted via left brain coding facilities augmented by technology. <br>
     <br>
     So if I'm right and the unconscious motivation of cinema, TV, video <br>
     gaming and (future) neuro surfing is the realisation of an eden <br>
     reclaimed fantasy then two things bear consideration about all this:<br>
     <br>
     1:<br>
     In the 16th Century St Ignatius de Loyola (I do believe) invented the <br>
     term technology to describe language. This was core to his treatise / <br>
     tractate / book "Powers of Imagination". If we accept that imaging is <br>
     our mental connection to emotion then eidetic or on going, self <br>
     supporting visualisations could be considered as glimpses into the <br>
     mirror of our souls (loose definiiton of soul: sum of emotional <br>
     causality. Emotion I find harder to define.) Here's some geek theory:<br>
     "coders" are obsessed with transforming mental experience into <br>
     mathematical code, to be actualised in silicon, visualised on screen. <br>
     NOT the same as saying "coders" are fleeing the mirrors of their <br>
     souls. It's what makes fractal imagery and geek theory in general so <br>
     fascinating. Let the coders out to play! Just bear in mind that there <br>
     are multitudes of humans who access their personal cinemas directly <br>
     and expertly. The mountains are peppered with them. (Upside of <br>
     buddhism #1)<br>
     <br>
     2. <br>
     The images generated by neural net being corporate generated, not <br>
     emotionally generated, thus thwarting the escapist motivation, in <br>
     exactly the same way that noticing the formula of a Hollywood plot <br>
     thwarts todays escapist motivation, only worse. What exists in our <br>
     minds has power because it is us, our full emotional beings <br>
     experienced first hand. Think carefully before allowing McDonalds to <br>
     set up a billboard. <br>
     What interests me me is the (direct) exchange between individuals of <br>
     mental imagery, which by it's very nature would be of primarily <br>
     emotional content. Much as lovers exchange dreams and interpretations <br>
     in the morning. Accelerated and with more freudian slips than you <br>
     could poke a stick at.<br>
     I would become very worried by developments leading towards a one way <br>
     corporate to individual communication. Berlin wall or not, <br>
     corporations are still committees and my demand for three humped <br>
     camels is very low indeed. <br>
     <br>
     Enough ranting. (psychedelics will be legalised as soon as <br>
     corporations realise they can make money out of them and bring <br>
     pressure to bear on governments via slush funds and the sugar sweet <br>
     sound byte - then we'll have some FUN - a Las Vegas for Psilocybin <br>
     (?)) <br>
     <br>
     PS: What's the difference between describing one's fascination with an <br>
     object and describing the object itself?<br>
