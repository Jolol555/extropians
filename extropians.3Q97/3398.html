Okay.  Gravity does not just "stretch" space-time.  It also "curves"<br>
space-time.  The rubber-sheet analogy is overused and does NOT give you a feel<br>
for what gravity really is.  The best explanation I know of is this:  The<br>
Earth moves in a straight line around the sun.  If you toss a ball across a<br>
room, it will move in a straight line.  Newton says that everything moves in a<br>
straight line unless a force acts on it.  Since gravity isn't a force - it's<br>
the curvature of space - objects under the free influence of gravity move in<br>
straight lines.<br>
<p>
How?  Imagine an x-y graph, where y is space and x is time.  If (the<br>
graph)/(spacetime) isn't curved, then all particles move in straight lines<br>
unless a force is acting on them.  If a particle is drifting slowly "up" (in<br>
1D space), then the graph of the particle's position is a straight line on a<br>
flat 2D spacetime.  If we introduce an acceleration towards "down", then a<br>
particle which starts out by moving "up" will reach apogee, stop, and start<br>
back "down" again.  The spacetime trajectory, the picture on the graph, is a<br>
parabola.  (This even though space is only 1D; space AND time are 2D, so you<br>
can graph a parabola in it.)<br>
<p>
Now, if you have a curved surface - a 2D surface curved in 3D space - then a<br>
"straight line" on that surface, a "geodesic", the shortest distance between<br>
two points on that surface, can be a 3D curve.  From the 2D perspective, it<br>
looks like a straight line.  From the 1D perspective, it looks like a<br>
parabolic trajectory.<br>
<p>
What looks like a parabolic trajectory to you (3D), is a straight line in<br>
space-time (4D), which is curved.  (Space-time does not necessarily require a<br>
higher dimension to be curved "in"; by stretching and shrinking in particular<br>
directions, you can get the isomorphic effect.)  The ball is following a<br>
geodesic; any other path between Event A (when it left your hand) and Event B<br>
(when it hit the floor) would be a longer spacetime distance, by the<br>
relativistic definition of distance.<br>
<p>
(Confusing note:  From the perspective of the ball, any other path would take<br>
*less* time; for example, it could zoop off from your hand at .99c, then zoop<br>
back to the floor.  Since time slows down as c is approached, the ball would<br>
think it made the trip in microseconds.  In Special Relativity, the shortest<br>
path always takes the most "proper time".  "Distance" is arbitrary, depending<br>
on your frame of reference.  If distance were minimized, different observers<br>
would disagree on what was a straight line, and would observe different laws<br>
of physics.)<br>
<p>
So what tears the astronaut apart is not stretched space or stretched time,<br>
either of which would be undetectable, but curved spacetime, which from our<br>
perspective is experienced as huge accelerations.  Tidal forces, the<br>
difference in accelerations between different points, are all that remains to<br>
rip apart the astronaut like toilet paper.<br>
