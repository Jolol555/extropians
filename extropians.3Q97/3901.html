In a message dated 97-09-17 00:23:55 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Hi!&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Not yet...but I'm working on it...&lt;beer...the wellspring of civilization&gt;<br>
 <br>
 &lt;I have some questions about economical principles, some regarding<br>
 free-markets and libertarian ideals and since many of you seem to<br>
 support libertarianism, complete individual freedom, free-markets, etc,<br>
 I wondered if you could answer my doubts.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I'll try...i'm probably the least educated on the list...but I have very<br>
strong opinions....and a variety of experiences from which to draw REASONS<br>
for said opinions.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;Let's start:<br>
 Are most of you, extropians, libertarians?&gt;<br>
<p>
Don't know about most...but I am...card carrying.<br>
<p>
&lt; Why do you think free-markets are the best economical solution?&gt;<br>
<p>
same reason that Danny Hills built the "Thinking Machine"...it works....and<br>
it's "Robust"..multiple attempts mean multiple chances for succes...many<br>
failures perhaps...but eventually the parallel processing aspects will grind<br>
out a solution...and later ANOTHER...and another...and......as tech improves<br>
and society and the economy evolve..<br>
<p>
 &lt;In today's world, it's almost impossible to do something without<br>
 affecting other persons, still why do you claim individual freedom and<br>
 an almost cult of individual property so important?&gt;<br>
<p>
So ....what's your point?  that's a nonsequentar...chaos theory suggests that<br>
a butterfly fart in antartica might eventuate a hurricane in some other<br>
location...or to be less crude "you can't only do just ONE thing"....it has<br>
always been thus and is not a social pehenomenon...it has nothing to do with<br>
the desire for individual freedom (see above...it works) <br>
<p>
 &lt;&lt;Complete freedom in economies will bring to the scene big corporations<br>
 instead of small, local business.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Prove it.  It has never happened yet....  There is such a thing as an<br>
optimium size for a business...for example Hog Farming (or any<br>
farming)...absent government meddling...technology allows economies of<br>
scale...low tech means that the prices are high...and small numbers of hogs<br>
bring high enough prices to allow small operators to stay in<br>
existence...however ...as tech improves...the margin of profit<br>
decreases....You can get rich if you have a million hogs...but you'll go<br>
broke if you have only a hundred...since you have certain "fixed" costs...and<br>
certain "variable' costs...of operation...and yet the sale price for the hog<br>
is the same...no matter how many hogs you have...hence to make money you have<br>
to sell a LOT of hogs...<br>
<p>
or chickens...most especially chickens...<br>
<p>
There are multiple and obvious examples of  too much control strangling an<br>
economyh...The FORMER soviet union...Cuba...Spain....New York<br>
City...California...(ole trucker adadge...bedbuggers have a saying about<br>
California...".U-hauls in...United Van Line out")<br>
<p>
or to put it another way..."What you want more of ...you subsidize...What you<br>
want less of ....you tax"<br>
<p>
Think about welfare...corporate flight...the rising south...the declining<br>
"Rust"belt...<br>
<p>
 &lt;&lt;Won't this corporations have too much<br>
 power and therefore harming everyone (the consumers and general public)<br>
 but themselves?&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
If any corp starts exploiting...they go broke...(absent  government<br>
meddling)...monopolies are only possible in a controlled economy...can't<br>
happen in a free market...negative feedback..<br>
<p>
 &lt;&lt;Do you think the economy should be based on small<br>
 business or big corporations?&gt;&gt; <br>
<p>
who's to say...I don't beleive in "should"...it depends on the economic<br>
situation...as I said...economies of scale....only a government beuracrate<br>
would have the god-awful egotism to think that he can outhink the<br>
market...one tiny little mind..and a mediorcre one at that (Politics is the<br>
art of the Possible...hence it is staffed by mediocre minds...Great minds<br>
attempt the impossible...or something like that)...or a group...better than<br>
millions and millions of individual transactions?  A market is ruled by<br>
similar forces that govern any ecology....vastly complex...<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; What do you think of environmental issues?&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
See "Trashing the Planet" by Dixie Lee Ray...<br>
<p>
 &lt;Do you think technology will<br>
 always give us the solutions to all our problems?&gt;<br>
<p>
Nothing else will that's for certain....you can squat in a corner and rub<br>
blue mud on your belly for ever...chanting matras and thinking pure<br>
thoughts....and that won't solve ..any problems...(didn't build any diesel<br>
engines, hiways, bridges...)<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; What do you think the intervention of government in economy should be?&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
None...zero...zip...nadda...<br>
 <br>
 &lt;&lt;Guess that's all but I'm sure that whatever your answers will be, I'll<br>
 have other questions waiting.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
You got questions...I got answers...even if it's "i don't know"..<br>
 <br>
 &lt;&lt;Thanks in advance,&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
 You're quiet welcome....glad I could clear that up for you..<br>
