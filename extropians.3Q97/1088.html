Yes, that was a slight give-away :-) When I saw it, I got quite<br>
curious about what those high-level things were, and Benford didn't<br>
dissapoint me. <br>
<p>

<p>
Yes, they are like the metasystems of Principia Cybernetica. Just as<br>
an ant can't understand an anthill, a meme (or set of memes) can't<br>
understand a keme. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I wonder, though, whether intelligence and ignorance aren’t both</i><br>

<i>&gt; do not dictate. We cause to happen." </i><br>
<p>
I got the impression that the Syntony behaved in a fairly haughty<br>
manner simply to get the right reactions from the humans. It might<br>
have suited their purposes to make the humans look down on them. If<br>
they had been awed by the Syntony they might have ended up as just<br>
another group of followers, which would not have increased the<br>
diversity of the manifold.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The next step is to recognize that consciousness might be scalable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Syntony can not be conscious ("all wove and lurked and had no</i><br>
<i>&gt; conscious voice"), only its agents, on whatever level, can do that.</i><br>
<p>
An interesting idea. Are we perhaps "conscious-centric"? We regard<br>
conscious systems as better than non-conscious systems just because<br>
we (apparently) are conscious. It might be just as silly as<br>
anthropocentrism or the belief in a fixed self. <br>
<p>
One of my visions of a posthuman state is a wast sea of mental "lego" <br>
blocks (perhaps implemented as a wast tuple space running on a<br>
jupiter brain?). They are constantly tumbling into each other,<br>
forming transient systems of all sizes. External influences affect<br>
this sea, making useful systems emerge and then melt back into the<br>
sea when their purpose is completed. It might be that most of the<br>
system is unconscious and nonintelligent, but parts become conscious<br>
if needed. A bit like the Thinker caste of Bruce Sterlings classic<br>
story _Swarm_. <br>
