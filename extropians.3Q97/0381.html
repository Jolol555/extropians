There is a complexy threshold for man-made systems, which makes them<br>
progressively expensive to operate. There also seems a pretty sharp<br>
boundary where the system is suddenly _unable_ to operate at all. Many<br>
aerospace designs and large software projects hover at that threshold. <br>
<p>
This needs not to be so, however. Naturally evolved systems do not show such <br>
marked brittleness, and their occasional failures can be attributed to <br>
random mutation noise crucial for the darwinian optimization process to <br>
function.<br>
<p>
Systems which can tolerate defects are comparatively easy to do. As <br>
next generations hardware is likely to feature many 10^9 active elements, <br>
their production error and failure error rate must be counteracted by <br>
redundancy to make them both affordable and operable. WSI FPGA and CAM <br>
EHWs are obviously a step into the right direction. Langmuir-Blodgett <br>
should give us 2 1/2 d-systems, whereas true 3d integration is only <br>
achievable with crystal growth autoassembly.<br>
<p>
Self-healing systems at microscopic module scale are only achievable by <br>
means of molecular manufacturing, whether machine or solvate phase. Don't <br>
expect them too soon.<br>
