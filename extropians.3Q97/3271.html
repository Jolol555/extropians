Back at the beginning of August, Sarah Marr asked:<br>
&lt;Has anybody read any well though out, cogently argued and<br>
evidentially supported theories as to why technology, commerce,<br>
exploration, science, etc. developed in the West (and East) whilst the<br>
African sub-continent remained isolated and communites there relied on<br>
gatherer-hunter activities and basic agriculture?&gt;<br>
<p>
There were some nice cites, including Jared Diamond.  The following<br>
doesn't directly address your query, but might still be of interest.<br>
<p>
I just stumbled on the site of Dr John Robert Skoyles at<br>
<a href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~skoyles/index.htm">http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~skoyles/index.htm</a><br>
<p>
Skoyles is a ‘retired’ neuroscientist who also dabbles in cultural<br>
anthropology.  His site contains excerpts from several of his books<br>
and essays.  He writes, for example, about "Literacy and the Greek<br>
revolution" and "Hunter-gatherers of the alphabet".<br>
<p>
At the end of his paper on the the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis he<br>
concludes: "Here therefore we have direct evidence that language<br>
moulds cognition. Two groups of otherwise identical and normal<br>
children have been raised in linguistic environments which differ in<br>
one specific domain, and found to show a specific cognitive<br>
difference."<br>
<p>
He also has some theories about neural plasticity, symbolism and<br>
culture that may be of interest:<br>
<p>
"Most brains lack the required buffers in which to train upon<br>
themselves such associations. But the human brain has them in our<br>
massive prefrontal cortices, one of whose main functions is working<br>
memory (Fuster, 1989; Goldman-Rakic, 1994). These contain active<br>
on-line buffers that can maintain the activations of different<br>
networks in temporal conjunction, and so help train them to interact,<br>
thus in effect, neurally reprogramming them to acquire the<br>
representational associations needed for symbols."<br>
<p>

<p>
In other words, differences in technological development between<br>
cultures may be partially due to the language that is used to relate<br>
to the world.<br>
