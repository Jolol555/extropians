: I do, however know some stuff about recent history and this taught me<br>
: that it is impossible to predict (in advance that is) what the practical<br>
: consequences of any new social order will be. Various experiments have<br>
: been done during this century, all of them ended in disaster or are still<br>
: running without achieving their planned goals so far (Cuba, N-Korea).<br>
<p>
And what the disastrous experiments have in common is that they all<br>
concentrated power in the name of a national goal, suppressing the<br>
individual goals of the people, thereby reducing the redundancy and<br>
resilience of the system.  From this surely we can learn something.<br>
<p>
: I'm not saying Libertarianism could not yield fine results, I'm saying<br>
: we just don't (can't!) know for sure because it has not been tried yet.<br>
<p>
Hasn't it?  We can certainly point to countries that were *more*<br>
libertarian than others at the same time, and compare.<br>
<p>
In some ways, the autocracies of two centuries ago would look like<br>
libertarianism run amok compared with most of today's states.<br>
Americans revolted then against "intolerable" taxes that we today<br>
would barely notice.<br>
<p>
: It would be intersting to see what happens, only will there be<br>
: an emergency brake? What if there's something we missed?<br>
<p>
Bad metaphor.  The state's response to anything unexpected is to<br>
put the emergency brake on society (while society has very little<br>
power to brake the state).  The brake discourages finding new<br>
solutions to problems - it's hard to steer with the brake on.<br>
<p>
Libertarianism offers not a brake, but a parachute: the ability<br>
of individuals to abandon a bad plan, and make a thousand new ones--<br>
of which only one needs to work.  It's sloppy and non-deterministic,<br>
but it seems to work better than the alternative.<br>
<p>
: There was a bug like that in communism... it killed 100,000,000<br>
: humans (conservative estimate). Please de-bug before running!<br>
<p>
Communism killed millions because it held, as an article of dogma,<br>
that if your goal is virtuous it doesn't matter how many people get<br>
hurt or killed on the road to reaching it.  <br>
<p>
	For the sake of the achievement of a specific political goal, <br>
	it is possible to sacrifice half mankind.<br>
		---Mao Tse-Tung, November 1957<br>
<p>
Libertarianism, on the contrary, holds that NO goal justifies aggression.<br>
