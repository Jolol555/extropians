Sound reasoning overall, Sarah, tho' I found myself thinking this whole<br>
discussion provides a good example why a proliferation of coexisting PPLs<br>
is more attractive than the present system.  It should be able to<br>
accommodate these ambiguities without bringing the whole civil house of<br>
cards down.  Not to say the two individuals we're discussing here would be<br>
championed by any PPL I'd personally endorse, but, really, I don't know<br>
enough in this particular case to pass judgment (NB: this is NOT an<br>
invitation for more of these lengthy posts about the case).  It's a deadly<br>
thing regulating anything so conspicuously *variable* as sexuality by way<br>
of majority opinion.  Best, Dale<br>
