Thank you Hal, I was starting to worry it was just me. <br>
Mr. Legg, whatever ideas you were trying to communicate in your post, <br>
was that really the only way you could figure out how to do it, <br>
is that the clearest you can  write? Seems a little odd coming from somebody <br>
concerned with language traps, but perhaps I'm being unfair, perhaps <br>
it's just because good old Dramatica Theory is lousing its formulation. <br>
I hate when that happens.                         <br>
<p>
