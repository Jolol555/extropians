Huh? How does this follow? We have had the technology to alter the<br>
human germ line for several years by now as far as I know (the point<br>
is that nobody did it/was allowed to), but that doesn't mean we know<br>
how to do many useful alterations. <br>
<p>
Adding antioxidant genes might be a good start. Another is promoting<br>
more DNA repair (expensive in nature, we can afford it), which would<br>
decrease the risk for cancer. More in the future things like (say) <br>
linking the telomerase gene with an artificial promotor so that you<br>
can activate it by an injection of a drug, lengthening your telomeres<br>
under medical supervision. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not only that, but as our knowledge grows to gradually create</i><br>

<i>&gt; this. </i><br>
<p>
New species are not a goal per se; what would we (or they) use them<br>
for? Here is a simple way of creating homo sapiens secundus: use the<br>
established methods to create an extra chromosome (let us call it the<br>
Z chromosome), moving some genes from other chromosomes to it so that<br>
an individual with the Z would not survive without it. Presto, we<br>
have a new species which cannot interbreed with ordinary homo<br>
sapiens. (Actually, the Z can be useful to carry all the new stuff,<br>
comments, personal data etc). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps Perry M. is right and this list has declined to the point</i><br>

<i>&gt; history marching past outside. </i><br>
<p>
Perhaps. But it might also be that we are so used to dramatic<br>
revolutions every week... <br>
