You seem to be assuming a bunch of isolated powers or labs working<br>

You're changed scenarios again!  First it was destructive gray goo<br>
launched by some nihilist fanatic.  Now it's national warfare.  Even<br>
if there was a leading power they could still be nuked, making<br>
declaration of nano-war somewhat unattractive.<br>
