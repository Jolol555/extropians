Probably not, but I do think that someone must have made a spirited and<br>
informed attempt. Does anyone have the name of any books worth reading? I<br>
suspect there are multiple ideas, parts of all of which are correct: I'd<br>
like the chance to judge them for myself.<br>

<p>
But that, of course, begs the question: how did the Roman Empire come in to<br>
being? Does this, I wonder, lead back to the 'cradle of civilization' in<br>
the Middle East? What puzzles me is how tool-use occurred throughout<br>
humanity, but at some point stopped developing for some people, whilst<br>
others continued to develop more and more advanced technology. And, in some<br>
ways, more advanced societal structures (although that is open to debate).<br>
