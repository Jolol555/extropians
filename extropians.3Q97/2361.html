Every mythology has shape-changers (voluntary or involuntary).<br>
Is that evidence for or against a general claim that appearance<br>
is the key element of a public identity?<br>

<p>
As well as certain visual features.  Anders has his conspicuous (yet<br>
tasteful) .sig, John Clark his long indents, EvMick his caenisms --<br>
without these features, I'd have less of a sense of their distinctness.<br>
I don't mean to say that without such visual stylisms you're doomed to<br>
be a blur in my mind, but it does take longer for me to form an<br>
impression of who's who.<br>
