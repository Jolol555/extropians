You're up against tough competition.  Don't think that Microsoft is one to<br>
rest on its laurels...  Microsoft has invested significant research dollars<br>
into a variety of improvements to their OS which will have a profound<br>
impact on the way we interact with our computers, if only because Microsoft<br>
is monopolizing the market.<br>
<p>
<p>
Take a look:  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/research/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/research/default.htm</a><br>
<p>
Especially take note of "Intentional Programming," which reminds me a lot<br>
of what you're talking about.  (They refer to components where you refer to<br>
objects.)  Also note Natural Language Processing, which I'm told has<br>
undergone significant enhancement since its first implementation in the<br>
Microsoft Office Answer Wizard...  I know *I* would spend a great deal for<br>
a computer running a NLP UI that WORKED.<br>
<p>
IMUninformedO, NLP or something similar is the next UI breakthrough,<br>
bridging the gap between the GUI and the neural interface; I'm also not<br>
convinced that AI is necessary to understand language.<br>
<p>
Carry on...<br>
