I would like to start a thread on hybrids and speciation <br>
<p>
        Hybrids between two related species have been a common<br>
occurrence in biology. It is a point where the way nature really works<br>
and the way biologist view nature break down. The Biological Species<br>
Concept would suggest that organism that can interbreed successfully<br>
would be within the same species....but clearly organism that have<br>
different behaviors, physical features, and even environments have been<br>
known to breed when brought together either naturally or with human<br>
intervention.<br>
<p>
        Hybrids are considered to be flukes, accidental pairings, which<br>
lead to unfit progeny. This is often the case between distant, although<br>
related animals. One must only look to the mating of a Horse and Donkey:<br>
a viable, strong creature, but sterile. The genes of those parents are<br>
lost forever and it is an evolutionary dead end. See FIG 2.  <br>
<p>
        We normally think of speciation occurring via a SPLIT in gene<br>
pools, via environmental barriers or behavior restraints. Two species<br>
move apart from one another and will never be a part of the same gene<br>
pool again. At least, that is the usual thinking when we talk about<br>
reproductively isolated species. See FIG 1.<br>
<p>
        What if the Hybridization occurs between two sister species, and<br>
the offspring are better adapted, have higher variability, and are<br>
fertile. These creatures would not be evolutionary dead ends, instead,<br>
they would be evolutionary BEGINNINGS! FIG 3 shows just that. For a<br>
hybrid to take root in the parent species niche, we would expect this<br>
pairing happens often. <br>
<p>
        I did a short review of the hybrid literature this morning, but<br>
I did not see anyone suggest that this could very well be mechanism for<br>
speciation in ANIMALS, but a recent blurb in SCIENCE, Vol. 277, July 18,<br>
1997 (p 316) suggests that the native crayfish population has been<br>
invaded by an exotic crayfish population; however, both population are<br>
being replaced by the fertile hybrids.<br>
<p>
Let me all know what you think.<br>
