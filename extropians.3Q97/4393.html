However, it's probably yet another example of humanity's failure to<br>
understand probability, and our natural desire to fit everything into<br>
consistent models. <br>
<p>
Let's suppose the story *is* true. There were primitive tribes all over<br>
the world, many of whom had weird tales like the Dogon's, but most of them<br>
were wrong; noone finds this at all strange. Then, suddenly, one of them<br>
happens to be right, and rather than realising that sooner or later one of<br>
these tales would be right purely by chance, we immediately get tales of<br>
aliens landing and passing on secret knowledge about their home star. <br>
<p>
More importantly, there's recently been a discussion of the Dogon on<br>
Usenet; from what I gather their 'secret knowledge' about Sirius was not<br>
reported until a century after they were first contacted, and they also<br>
had 'secret knowledge' of various other astronomical phenomena which were<br>
thought to be true at the time but were later disproved. Sounds a lot like<br>
they learnt it from a visiting scientist, not aliens.<br>
