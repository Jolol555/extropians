<p>
Why does the ability to talk have anything to do with consciousness? A<br>
computer can talk, but someone with cerebral palsy might not be so able.<br>
Hobbes (?) would agree that the use of language is what separates man<br>
from animal. I don't think he went so far as to say it is what makes us<br>
conscious. <br>
<p>
As far as the second criteria, I agree that self-awareness is necessary<br>
to consciousness, indeed I think it is the definition of consciousness. <br>
<p>
In order to be self-aware, a system must have two things 1) will and 2)<br>
power.<br>
<p>
Will is the ability to self-direct (L. volo) according to one's own<br>
self-interest.<br>
<p>
Power is the abilitiy to warp (L. inflecto) the normal course of events.<br>
If something exists it by definition must have a certain measure of<br>
power.<br>

<p>
So a system is self-aware if it can discuss its experiences? I think the<br>
more distilled version of this is if a system can understand and use the<br>
first person singular. I think, I feel, I did, I was, etc.<br>
