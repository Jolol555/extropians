<i>&gt; I will offer my own tentative analysis.  Suppose in a different experiment</i><br>
<i>&gt; a subject is given a sleeping pill without being told what will happen</i><br>
<i>&gt; during his sleep.  When he wakes up, the experimenter tells him this:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "You are not a clone. However during your sleep a fair coin was tossed and</i><br>
<i>&gt; if it landed head up an exact duplicate was made of you. What is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; probability that the coin landed head up?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now I think the correct answer to all these questions is 1/2. Once you</i><br>
<i>&gt; know you are not a clone, the knowledge that a coin flip outcome may</i><br>
<i>&gt; have caused some unobservable external material to be rearranged should</i><br>
<i>&gt; not change the distribution of that outcome.</i><br>
<p>
This seems reasonable, but I don't understand the following:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If answer set A is correct, and suppose the</i><br>
<i>&gt; copying process is slightly defective so that the original can tell that</i><br>
<i>&gt; he is not a clone when he wakes up, then you will observe the subject say</i><br>
<i>&gt; "the probability that the coin will land head up is 1/2" before he goes to</i><br>
<i>&gt; sleep and say "the probability that the coin landed head up is 1/3"</i><br>
<i>&gt; immediately after he wakes up.</i><br>
<p>
Isn't this really the same?  If he can tell that he is not a clone when he<br>
wakes up, isn't that the same as telling him that he is not a clone when he<br>
wakes up?  And in that case, why is the probability of heads 1/2 in one<br>
case and 1/3 in another?<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
