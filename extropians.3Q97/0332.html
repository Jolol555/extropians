You may have shot a hole in your argument here. If it doesn't matter how <br>
long it takes, then what good is progress?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; A "true" anarchy is where individuals can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; do anything they want as long as it doesn't interfere with anothers</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; freedom.  If an individual or group of individuals grabs a bunch of </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;arms and starts terrorizing the rest of the people in this &gt;&gt;"anarchy" </i><br>
into submission, then we no longer have "anarchy" but a &gt;&gt;new form of <br>
authoritarianism.. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In an anarchy, every citizen will understand that their own self </i><br>
<i>&gt;defense is their own responsibility. THose that don't deserve their </i><br>
<i>&gt;fate.</i><br>
<p>
Ha.ha..Your argument here makes me giggle.. In that case, you shouldn't <br>
mind the system &lt;we're currently living in&gt;!  Our current system of <br>
nations, armys, laws, bureaucrats and dictatorships have all evolved to <br>
their current state in a situation you have just advocated! <br>
<p>

<i>&gt;As for the gas station monopolist, those are the breaks. If the gas</i><br>
<i>&gt;station owners did not utilize public opinion to force a curtailment or</i><br>
<i>&gt;accommodation, its their own damn fault.</i><br>
<p>
Curious.  Tell me how a small-time operator in 1919, when there was <br>
little or no access to telephones, radio, TV or big-town newspapers, <br>
would find the time take on the herculean task of mounting a public <br>
opinion campaign against Rockefeller?  He would surely go out of <br>
business in the process.<br>
<p>

P.S. With regard to the rest of your post, I agree.<br>
