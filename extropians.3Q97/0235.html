Actually, we have had several approving discussions of an alternative<br>
to strict capitalism, the polycentric legal system, aka PPL, privately<br>
produced law.  In this system people voluntarily choose what set of laws<br>
they wish to live under, and the market determines the cost to the customer<br>
of having various laws available to him.  Sometimes people assume that<br>
PPL would be a mechanism to achieve a laissez-faire society, but this is<br>
not necessarily the case in practice.<br>
<p>
In such a system, certain libertarian or laissez-faire legal principles<br>
may be prohibitively expensive, if they are despised by a large majority of<br>
the population.  For example, a religious Muslim majority may be offended<br>
by the sight of people walking around and not praying during the appointed<br>
times.  These people may choose to live under a law which makes it a<br>
crime for anyone not to pray, or at least to bow down as though they are<br>
praying, at the call of the Muadh-dhin.  While it might be theoretically<br>
possible for the non-religious to live under a legal system where that<br>
is not a requirement, in practice it could be prohibitivelly expensive,<br>
given strong enough feelings among the religious majority.<br>
<p>
Other forms of victimless crimes could have similarly high barriers,<br>
when the population as a whole believes that the acts are morally wrong<br>
and should be prevented.<br>
<p>
There is debate over the degree to which PPL would be libertarian, and it<br>
may well be that it would tend to be more libertarian than a democratic<br>
system, but the point is that it has been discussed favorably on the<br>
extropian list despite its differences from a strict laissez-faire system.<br>
<p>
(Privately produced law is a new idea for many people, and I am not trying<br>
to explain it here.  The list archives may have some pointers to better<br>
sources on the subject.)<br>
