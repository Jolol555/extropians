<i>&gt;     The last time I mentioned Chomsky here I received a peculiar response </i><br>
<i>&gt;     which roughly said that Chomsky's irrelevance stems from his obsession </i><br>
<i>&gt;     with the rest of the world (excluding the USA) which somehow obscured </i><br>
<i>&gt;     what "the people" really should know. Or words to that effect. I </i><br>
<i>&gt;     didn't understand the sentiment behind the statement and found it to </i><br>
<i>&gt;     be rather parochial, narrow and indicative enough of the kind of con </i><br>
<i>&gt;     the US media plays on it's people, without having to add or respond. </i><br>
<i>&gt;     I can't remember who made the response, but I'm still curious.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     The film "Manufacturing Consent" seems somehow relevant to the NSPIC </i><br>
<i>&gt;     antiparadigm. </i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<p>
Well, speaking only for myself, *I* don't consider Chomsky a total waste of<br>
time in this regard. BTW, in the 60's he was widely regarded as an<br>
anarcho-socialist or anarcho-syndicalist, at least... and thought there are<br>
probably a lot of anarcho-capitalists on this list, I bet they'd all be<br>
able to deal with any anarcho-socialist who really understood and accepted<br>
the Non-Aggression Principle.<br>
<p>
One of the key points Chomsky makes in the film (at least the version I<br>
saw) is that if a conversation (or its media pseudo-equivalent, the<br>
"Debate" (rueful grimace)) is framed (apt word, that) in a certain simple<br>
set of terms, people aren't prepared to deal with anything too remote from<br>
those accepted terms. In his words, "They think you're from Mars.".<br>
<p>
My view is as follows:<br>
<p>
1) Sometimes this is due to deliberate "if they can get you asking the<br>
wrong questions, it doesn't matter what answer you get..." (akin to "they<br>
can vote anybody in, as long as *I* control the primary election results...").<br>
<p>
2) Sometimes it is due to the person being from Mars. <br>
<p>
3) Sometimes (and this is a tough one) it's due to _both_. Vide the<br>
recently-released _Conspiracy Theory_, starring Mel Gibson, Julia Roberts,<br>
and Patrick Stewart.<br>
<p>
The people who, grappling with these issues and each other, brawled their<br>
way into the Extro salon while tumbling and scrapping, seem to me as if<br>
they may be in Category Three. Is this what you mean by "a square wheel<br>
with curves"?<br>
<p>
Inter alia, I sometimes find it instructive to consider how much the<br>
process called "building consensus" differs from "manufacturing consent".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     Whenever a new ongoing protest hits the news the first article will </i><br>
<i>&gt;     include the opening argument. From there we receive little more than a </i><br>
<i>&gt;     bodycount. The argument hasn't stopped, nor has it been merely </i><br>
<i>&gt;     replaced with bloodshed, it continues to be developed but fast becomes </i><br>
<i>&gt;     too complex to be accounted within the two minute structure.</i><br>
<p>
Just like a game of cup-and-balls or Three-Card Monte. The 5 W's they teach<br>
in Journalism (at least they're W's in the USA :) -- "Who, What, Where,<br>
When, Why" -- to be delivered as tightly as possible -- are tailor made for<br>
category errors (see Lakoff's _Women, Fire &amp; Dangerous Things_),<br>
nominalization, deletion and distortion. <br>
<p>
"Media are the memetic equivalent of cluster bombs. They're area-denial<br>
ordnance, only mostly they just retarget the same old barren spots on the<br>
landscape."  -- Me, just now. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     BTW, I'm not interested in what Chomsky has to say because he's </i><br>
<i>&gt;     particularly pro or anti US. I'm interested in him because he is a </i><br>
<i>&gt;     celebrated and imaginative linguist and a true scholar. The connection </i><br>
<i>&gt;     between linguistics and the media seems rather obvious to me.</i><br>
<p>
Noam himself probably doesn't think of himself as anti-US.<br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;     is all the state ever was or could be. "Democracy" invites the </i><br>
<i>&gt;     neccessity to manufacture consent. </i><br>
<p>
Yep. This is its chief flaw. See Shakespeare's _Julius Caesar_. Nothing new<br>
under the sun.<br>
