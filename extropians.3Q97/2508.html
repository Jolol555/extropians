<p>
There are already nanopowers.    <br>
<p>
The standard scenario of the advent of nanotech is that someone will, in a<br>
very brief time, go from where we are now to diamondoid nanotech.  If a<br>
human immune system or army tried to fight off a diamondoid aggressor, it<br>
would be like a bear trying to fight a helicopter gunship.  Hence, the 'gray<br>
goo problem'.  However, I think the standard scenario is wrong.  <br>
<p>
Consider a spectrum of nanotechnologies.  At one end is life, at the other<br>
end is diamondoid nanotech.  Our present-day nanotechnology, called 'life',<br>
is energy-efficient, sloppy, abundant, hard to reprogram, slow to reproduce<br>
and physically weak and vulnerable.  Diamondoid nanotech consumes lots of<br>
energy, can be extremely precise, does not yet exist, is easy to reprogram,<br>
is quick to reproduce, and is physically strong and tough.  I doubt that<br>
engineering will suddenly leap from one end of the scale to another.  All<br>
the plans I've seen and heard for getting to the first assembler produce an<br>
assembler that is far from diamondoid.  The hope is to use that to produce a<br>
slightly better assembler, which will be used to produce the next<br>
generation, et cetera.<br>
<p>
Just as Drexlerian nanotech is made of diamondoid material, we can think of<br>
life as being made of 'nylonoid' material.  Protein is chemically similar to<br>
nylon, and about the same strength and stiffness.  The stiffer the basic<br>
material of which the nanotech is made, the more precise an assembler can<br>
be, and the more tightly bonded the materials it can assemble.  More tightly<br>
bonded materials are stiffer, so it takes a stiff assember to make a stiffer<br>
assembler.  So we can imagine bootstrapping from present-day materials to<br>
the ultimate:<br>
<p>
   Nylonoid assembles Kevlaroid.<br>
   Kevlaroid assembles quartzoid.<br>
   Quartzoid assembles sapphireoid.<br>
   Sapphireoid assembles diamondoid.<br>
<p>
Each of these stages is very valuable in its own right, and will open up a<br>
range of new possibilities.  And each of them will require thousands of<br>
genius-years to bootstrap to the next level.  Nobody will get from the first<br>
to the last level alone and in secret.  By the time someone develops<br>
diamondoid weapons, the world will have years of experience in fighting with<br>
weapons made out of kevlaroid, quartzoid and sapphireoid.<br>
<p>

PS.  Kevlaroid = amide-bonded unbranched polymers with only one degree of<br>
freedom instead of the two that proteins have.  Quartzoid = strongly<br>
cross-linked ceramics assembled in solution from metal oxide moeities (SiO4,<br>
MgO2, etc) and hydroxyl and organic side-chains.  Sapphireoid = the same,<br>
but assembled in vacuum, mostly AlO3 moeities, and no organics.<br>
