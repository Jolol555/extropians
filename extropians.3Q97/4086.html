<p>
<p>
I don't think that's the only reason people don't kill people, it certainly  <br>
isn't in my case, but nobody is suggesting murder be made legal.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Why has civilization lasted? IMHO, because there are laws, there is         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;a judicial system to prevent anarchy, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
First of all I don't want to prevent anarchy, second of all, anarchy does not <br>
mean no laws, it just means no state. Laws would be privately produced, <br>
private money making arbitration agencies would replace the judicial system, <br>
and Private Protection Agencies (PPA) would replace the police.<br>
                          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;in anarchy everyone would do what they want </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not quite, but it does mean that in things that are really important to you, <br>
like not getting killed, you can have much more influence than just one man one vote.<br>
                             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What if some corporation doesn't make enough mistakes to fall, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then it won't fall. It has always mystified me why so many people think  <br>
competence is a cold heartless vice that should be punished and incompetence  <br>
a warm human virtue that should be rewarded.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;it will eventualy take control of the market </i><br>
<p>
<p>
In other words people will be allowed to do what they're best at. <br>
How horrible.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;and then we will all suffer. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If it's a free market then the company can not get the government to send in <br>
its thugs to put its competition out of business, so the only way it can take <br>
control of the market is to produce a good product cheaper than anybody else <br>
can. How horrible.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;In a free-market, there will be the ones who are better than other         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;at their business, what if this persons are a lot better? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then they will produce a product that is a lot better and a lot cheaper than <br>
anybody else can. How horrible.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;They'll control everything in their area.</i><br>
                    <br>
Good!<br>
                    <br>
<i>        &gt;DuPont, one, if not the, largest producer of CFCs had knowledge of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the destructive effects of CFCs on the ozone but prevented this from         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;being known. There are several sources claiming this. </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
And there are several sources claiming that UFO abductions, astrology,  <br>
Bigfoot, and crying statues of the virgin Mary are real.  <br>
<p>
CFC- ozone chemistry in the upper atmosphere is extremely complex, even with  <br>
today's super computers it's not entirely clear what's going on, I don't see  <br>
how DuPont could have known about it years ago. The tobacco industry would <br>
have been a much better example for your purposes.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Governments are owned by corporations </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's not true, but I sure wish it was.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The free market of cities in America has also created many poor         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;people.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Poor compared to other Americans, rich compared to most of the other people <br>
of the world.<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;A corporation with a monopoly status will have the better research         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;facilities, the better marketing experts, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Would you be satisfied if the big corporation promised to use only obsolete  <br>
instruments in poor repair in its research facility, to immediately fire any  <br>
employee who wins the Nobel prize, and refuse to hire any scientist who  <br>
graduated from collage, except for barber and clown?<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>       &gt;it will even have the best criminals to take care of their opposition! </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Corporations are very far from being moral paragons, but in the criminality <br>
business they're small time. If you added up all the bad things that <br>
corporations  have done from the beginning of time it would amount to little <br>
more than mischief compared to the monstrous evil governments have <br>
perpetrated this century alone.<br>
<p>
                   <br>
<i>        &gt;If a corporation reaches monopoly in a no-rules world, it won't lose        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;easily and we will all suffer. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The only monopoly that is dangerous is the very biggest one, government. <br>
The  only successful cartels in history are the ones that have government <br>
support.           <br>
<p>
Your company and mine produce all the steel made in the world. We make a good <br>
profit now, but we want more, so we get together and triple our prices.<br>
Now we each make a huge profit on each ton of steel we sell, so we would both <br>
want to make lots and lots of steel. However, because the price of steel is <br>
now very high demand is down, so part of our sinister plot must be an <br>
agreement to limit production. The higher the price gets, the greater is the<br>
temptation to secretly cheat on the agreement and produce more steel than was <br>
agreed to and that would kill the cartel.<br>
<p>
There are even more problems for our poor cartel. Now that the price of steel <br>
is sky high and the profits are huge, other companies will want to get in on <br>
the act and start making steel. Also, consumers of steel will not want to <br>
shell out all that money for steel and will start looking for replacement <br>
materials like wood or plastic or aluminum or composite fiber. <br>
<p>
OK I will admit that one type of monopoly, called a "natural monopoly" would   <br>
work in a free market, but they don't bother me. In a few, very rare  <br>
instances, the most efficient size of a factory is so big that there is only   <br>
room for one, the best example is aluminum production. A larger steel mill is   <br>
not more efficient than a smaller one, it's just bigger, but for physical   <br>
reasons that's not true for an aluminum plant, the bigger the better.<br>
<p>
However even a natural monopoly is limited to what it can do. If they raise   <br>
prices too high a competitor with a smaller factory will step in. The small   <br>
factory is not as efficient as the big one, but by accepting a smaller profit   <br>
margin they can still charge less for aluminum than the big company. And of  <br>
course, there is always the competition from other materials. <br>
<p>
This logic did not phase the US government when in it's infinite wisdom it   <br>
decided to break up Alcoa Aluminum. <br>
What dreadful crime had Alcoa committed?   <br>
The government said it had kept competitors out. <br>
What dastardly method did Alcoa use to do this? <br>
The government said Alcoa used the most advanced technology available to <br>
produce Aluminum that was just too cheap for competitors to match. <br>
<p>
I wish I was joking about this, but I am not. If you can't beat them in the<br>
market place, lobby the government to send in their goons to destroy your <br>
competition.<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;if small shops go broke, the supermarkets will be able to put the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;prices they want </i><br>
                       <br>
<p>
Then the small shops will come back, but if they're good I don't see why they <br>
ever left. Being small is no excuse for being stupid and going broke,  <br>
it can be an advantage, but only if you're smart.<br>
<p>
I manufacture 99% of the worlds widgets, you make 1% . I want to drive you <br>
out of business, so I figure I'll lower my price until you go broke and then <br>
I can jack them up to anything I want. So now you louse money on each widget <br>
you sell, the trouble is I do too. I have 99 times as much money as you do, <br>
but I'm lousing it 99 times faster. Even worse, because the price is very low <br>
the demand for widgets is huge, and if prices are to remain low I must build <br>
more factories and increase production. I'm lousing money faster and faster, <br>
meanwhile you just temporally halt production in your small factory and wait <br>
for me to go broke. It won't be a long wait.                                 <br>
<p>
                       <br>
<i>        &gt;The rules and regulations prevent the market from employing people?         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;I can't believe that.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Believe it. If your services to me are only worth 4$ an hour and the  <br>
government says that because of the minimum wage I must pay you 5$ an hour  <br>
then I simply will not hire you, unless I want to give you charity.  <br>
I have nothing against charity, but it doesn't create wealth and certainly <br>
won't eliminate poverty.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;One last thing, extropy is the opposite of entropy. Our goal is to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;fight entropy or disorder and yet you defend  complete disorder in         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the economy.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Huh? Who said anything about complete disorder in the economy?<br>
                                                               <br>
