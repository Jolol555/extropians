Sure, and I agree with the point that kids should learn to rely on<br>
themselves. I just have no convincing evidence that sending them to public<br>
schools is a good way to do that, nor that child psychologists are any<br>
better at raising kids than normal parents. <br>

<p>
Yet continuing to send kids into that environment is better than teaching<br>
them at home? <br>
<p>

<p>
Uh, my experience, my friends' experiences, the experiences of those on<br>
this list... the only people I've met who didn't have similar tales to<br>
tell were either home-schooled or went to expensive private schools. <br>
<p>
And, since you're discussing 'socialization' on another thread, why would<br>
that be neccesary if I'm wrong? <br>
