Some time ago the EPA (FDA, FFA, ERA, SPCA,NAACP &lt;&lt;????&gt;&gt;&gt; I dunno...one of<br>
them gubment sneaky snakes) decided it needed to ban smoking...for our own<br>
good you know...and mandated right there in the constitution...(the third<br>
extension to the left of the fourth penumbra from the right.)<br>
<p>
So it decided to do a pissylogical study &lt;surely this name is not right...it<br>
makes too much sense&gt;...The first time it did it using scientifically<br>
accepted norms and practices...99% confidence interval and all that.<br>
<p>
Well that didn't work...nothing showed...didn't get the results they wanted..<br>
So do it again...throw out a few studies...lower the confidence<br>
interval...stuff like that..well it didn't work again...and again.<br>
<p>
But ...FINALLY..(gotta give them boys and girls credit...they're persistent)<br>
they got a %30 percent chance of getting some kind of respiritory ailment<br>
from "second hand" smoke.  That's more like it....why we can pass all kinds<br>
of legislation, rules...etc...and generally interfere with peoples lives and<br>
collect more taxes.<br>
<p>
Which is what they proceeded to do...the Attornies General suite against the<br>
Tubacker Industry is a case in point...&lt;Attornies General is just another<br>
name for crooked politician...why should we expect them to be moral or<br>
ethical?&gt;<br>
<p>
Meanwhile....another pissylogical study was done &lt;&lt;&lt;loooove that wordd&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
It had to do with the relation ship between abortions and breast cancer in<br>
women.  These folks were a little more ethical than the gubment crowd...they<br>
run the study right...<br>
<p>
And guess what?  100% better chance of a young lady getting breast cancer<br>
later in life if she has had an abortion than not.<br>
<p>
Ooooops....that is NOT politically correct....whatawe gonna do?<br>
<p>
Tell the truth?  Yeah...that'll work...fool 'em...they ain't expecting that<br>
from us.<br>
<p>
In pissylogical studies (so I understand) anything less than 100% is just<br>
noise...100% is considered "weak"...so the pro-abortion types told the<br>
truth...saying that there was only a "weak" link betwen abortion and breast<br>
cancer...(never mind that that weak link has been verified by numerous<br>
studies...internationally)<br>
<p>
And now all the liberals are happy...<br>
<p>
Meanwhile...one of the other alphabet soup agencies wants more power and<br>
authority...so they gotta plan...toughen the Air Quality Standards...and lets<br>
by pass Congress to do it...after all they're elected...subject to voter<br>
pressure and all that...we'll get the Philander in Chief to sign an executive<br>
order...<br>
<p>
Which he did..<br>
<p>
.but this gubment agency is very reluctant to show anyone the studies that<br>
supposedly confirms the need for the for the new tougher (and very, very,<br>
very expensive standards...probably put a lot of companies out of<br>
business...and make things 15 times more expensive than they oughta be rather<br>
than ten times as they are now)..<br>
<p>
Kinda neat huh?<br>
<p>
100% is "weak"- no need to be alarmed<br>
30% is grounds for lawsuits and regulations<br>
(?)% is good enough for forcing the whole economy to its knees...&lt;for the<br>
children...don't you know&gt;<br>
<p>
Just another example of Truth...Justice...and the Liberal Way.<br>
