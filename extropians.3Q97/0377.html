In a message dated 97-07-12 17:20:26 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; First, the Air Force's 'mogul' explanation's biggest problem for me is the<br>
<p>
 amount of material found (supposedly scattered for over a quarter of a <br>
 mile).  I've seen photo's of the 'mogul' balloons and 'there just ain't <br>
 enough stuff there to be noticeable' for that area (especially after being <br>
 blown around in a thunderstorm).  The largest component by far is the <br>
 balloon itself.  Even the ranch hand would know balloon material was not <br>
 some 'unknown' metallic structure.  The Air Force personnel certainly <br>
 would. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I happened to be in a room the other day in which a Television was turned<br>
on...I think it was tuned to the discovery channel...(perhaps the history<br>
channel)...and the topic was ......wwII mogul ballons...<br>
<p>
According to this source:<br>
<p>
  The Japanese had a site on one of their Islands, near a beach...in which<br>
they made and launched about 3000 "continental attack ballons" (my<br>
term)...They were made of....RICE PAPER...filled with hydrogen...had<br>
detatchable ballast packs filled with sand (beach was convient for<br>
that...which was how the launch site was located..(sand was<br>
identified...localized)...and bombed into oblivion by DoLittle). and had one<br>
bomb each...  They were launched into the Jet Stream...drifited across in a<br>
day or so...periodically dropping ballast or venting hydrogen to maintain<br>
altitude under the varying conditions of sunlite and darkness...(used an<br>
ingenious clockwork mechanism for this)...when the last ballast was<br>
dropped....the bomb was dropped next....terror weapon...ment to divert scarce<br>
resources from the war effort.(set forests afire,...randomly destroy whatever<br>
was underneath...kill people)<br>
<p>
But  RICE PAPER...not very metallic...and the ballons ...individually...were<br>
rather small...didn't appear that one would cover much area at all....when<br>
ripped to shreds...and this all occured further north ...I think.<br>
