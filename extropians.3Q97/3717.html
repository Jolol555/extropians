<p>
As far as extrapolating the few to the many, "what we hear about" and<br>
"what really goes on" can be two different sets. I have no evidence at<br>
all for this, but I would go out on a limb and suggest that it is indeed<br>
possible that election fraud has occurred without you or I ever hearing<br>
about it. But I do have a fertile imagination and this is not a<br>
"productive" position to take. <br>
<p>
What is productive is the position that no amount of media or<br>
governmental "watching" can ensure an honest election in every case. But<br>
you suggest a solution:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No, the system is not totally corrupt. There are some corrupt people in</i><br>
<i>&gt; almost every organization. What needs to be done is to increase our</i><br>
<i>&gt; emphasis on ethics.</i><br>
<p>
Whether the system is "totally corrupt" is more than I know. And you are<br>
right, in one sense, that ethical behavior is the key. However, a 100%<br>
honest ethical system cannot be imposed from without. The actors must<br>
believe in it themselves. So even if we do increase our emphasis on<br>
ethics, this does not solve the problem of unethical behavior. One has<br>
to look at the people who are running for public office, and most of<br>
them come from the legal community, as I'm sure you're well aware. <br>
<p>
The legal profession (lawyering in particular) is the only profession<br>
that requires an individual to suspend his or her own ethical system to<br>
perform his or her job. Otherwise only murderer-lawyers or those lawyers<br>
who believed murder was OK would be getting up in court to defend a<br>
murderer. So, to get around this, lawyers have developed a complex<br>
system of ethics in which the right of an accused to a fair trial<br>
supersedes any crime that accused has committed. I won't begin to<br>
address whether that may be correct or not, but I do want to argue that<br>
lawyers are used to dealing with tricky and sticky ethical issues on a<br>
daily basis. <br>
<p>
Coloring this is the fact that lawyers engage in post-hoc argumentation<br>
almost exclusively. A scientist will begin with possible conclusions,<br>
argue the correctness of each possibility and then decide on the facts.<br>
Lawyers begin with the facts, choose a conclusion, and then fill in the<br>
argumentative gaps as necessary. This is what they teach you in your<br>
first year of law school -- "how to think like a lawyer."<br>
<p>
The synthesis of these two points is that those in the legal profession<br>
are very, very good at justifying themselves to themselves. Where the<br>
typical rational thinker, when presented with the option of unethical<br>
behavior, will follow the normal course of resolving such issues<br>
(options, arguments, facts), the legal professional has the tendency to<br>
see the opportunity as a fact, then decide it's good for him, and then<br>
tell himself why. In short, and in my experience, lawyers are more<br>
capable of ethically questionable behavior than most.<br>
<p>
My final point is probably obvious. When a good portion of the people<br>
running for office are more capable than most of unethical behavior,<br>
unethical behavior may be more common among them, than among most. So<br>
imposing an ethical system from without is not likely to do too much<br>
good. And in fact, what you call cynicism about elections may actually<br>
be a recognition of this fact -- politicians are more capable of<br>
unethical behavior than most, and so unethical behavior probably occurs<br>
with greater frequency than we might guess.              <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Let's stop spitting on every little thing. </i><br>
<p>
Again, I would go out even further on a limb to say that allegations of<br>
election fraud are not "little things" in a democracy. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's not really that productive.</i><br>
<p>
Well that of course depends on what your definition of "productive" is,<br>
now doesn't it?<br>
