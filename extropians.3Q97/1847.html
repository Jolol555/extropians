It's true that sometimes signals in neurons, particularly in dendrites,  <br>
travel passively like in a simple wire, however I don't see how that could <br>
make much of a difference in the overall speed of the brain.  Such signals <br>
may not need to wait around to be amplified by voltage gated ion channels, <br>
but they're still pretty slow for other reasons. The neural membrane has a <br>
very high electrical capacitance, and this dramatically slows the signal <br>
because the membrane potential has to build up from the ion flow,  and the <br>
capacitance is so big this takes a long time, like filling a swimming pool <br>
with a straw.<br>
       <br>
Even if such signals were fast it still wouldn't be very important because of  <br>
their very short range. After about a millimeter the same high capacitance  <br>
has turned a sharp spike into a hill that is so gentle it's unrecognizable.  <br>
That's why amplification is needed for most things and that's really slow.<br>
