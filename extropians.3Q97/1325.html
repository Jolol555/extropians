It's much weirder that that. Place a polarizing filter set at 0 degrees over  <br>
one slit, and one set at 90 degrees over the other,  it's easy to tell what <br>
photon went through what slit and the interference pattern disappears. Now  <br>
place a third filter set at 45 degrees one mile from the slits and just one  <br>
inch in front of the film. Now you can't tell what photon went through what <br>
slit and the interference pattern comes back! <br>
         <br>
It can't be that the disturbance caused by measurement was the source of this, <br>
you put the third filter far from the slits and AFTER the photons decided <br>
what slit to go through. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle does not enter in <br>
any of this, it's not that the photon goes through one slit and we just don't <br>
know which one, it goes through one slit and both slits, and neither.<br>
                  <br>
In the Everett model  when the photon hits the plate the universe splits in <br>
two, if the photons just kept going into open space then the universes would <br>
remain separate, but if they hit the film and stop then the 2 worlds merge <br>
but retain some properties of going through both slits. When you place <br>
polarizers that are set differently over the slits the 2 photon will always <br>
be different as will be the effects of anything they hit, so the 2 universes <br>
(and the two of you) never merge and so you see no interference pattern.<br>
