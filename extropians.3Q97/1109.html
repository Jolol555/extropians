NOTICE TO THE EXTROPIANS LIST:<br>
<p>
My new policy: in order to make peace with the estimable Mr. Genen,<br>
and avoid any charges of kvetching, I'll confine myself to responding<br>
only to those parts of his missives with which I agree. If I do not post<br>
a response, it may be that I think he's a self-described career meddler<br>
in others' affairs, and proud of it, as we've both said; upon the other<br>
hand,<br>
it may simply be that I'm too in awe of his worldliness and--what <br>
was the word?--pondering? to dream of adding a jot from my own <br>
callow, feckless, worthless few decades' experience of trying <br>
to create the future's writing and thinking tools, so that <br>
those who choose might be free to live science fiction themselves<br>
rather than read it while living in chains--which bankrupt time, by the<br>
bye, <br>
some as the son of a politician, tells me among other things that <br>
much harm is done for others' good; excepting, of course, <br>
any law ever drafted by present company--I'm sure we needed every one <br>
of them more than we need(ed) a world hypertext library <br>
or a fundamental shift in how we perceive ethics.<br>
<p>
Can you tell I've been reading 18th-century authors lately? :)<br>

Dear Michael and other fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
That was a delightful response.<br>
<p>
Enjoy!!!<br>
