You make a number of unwarranted assumptions and judgements in the above.<br>
<p>
First, low unemployment *is* good for people *especially* in a free market<br>
economy.  Low unemployment inevitably raises wages for the average worker,<br>
as dictated by free market economics.  The reason companies are willing to<br>
pay me top wages is because involuntary unemployment is virtually<br>
non-existent in my industry.<br>
<p>
Second, you make the broad assumption that everyone wants to have<br>
"Full-time benefited employment".  I, for one, do *not* want full-time<br>
corporate desk job.  I have not been employed full-time in years and I keep<br>
it that way.  More and more people are taking this increasingly available<br>
option.  Many of my fellow professionals take between 2 to 6 months off per<br>
year.  Try and ask for that much time off from a company that gives<br>
"Full-time benefited employment"!  (I have to admit that I don't exercise<br>
this option due to the fact that I seem to prefer stress as my environment<br>
of choice.)<br>
<p>
Thirdly, who cares if "70% of working Americans feel they have less job<br>
security" when most working Americans also agree that job opportunities are<br>
abundant.<br>
