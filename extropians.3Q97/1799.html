<i>&gt;The the development of a (there you have it!) *deathwatch*. You</i><br>
<i>&gt;know, the device that's been discussed here before (or was it on</i><br>
<i>&gt;CryoNet?) with GSM/GPS, ultra-sensitive microphone pulse</i><br>
<i>&gt;measuring, (burst) warning signal, a buzzer, a heartbeat</i><br>
<i>&gt;recognition chip, maybe even voice activation and communication</i><br>
<i>&gt;possibilities, water tight, shock proof etc etc. This little gem</i><br>
<i>&gt;could *really* make a difference, because it would watch over you</i><br>
<i>&gt;night and day, 7 days a week, etc. No more "sneakin' a death"</i><br>
<i>&gt;(dying in bed is in fact one of the greatest risks for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;cryonicist. It could be hours, maybe even days before someone</i><br>
<i>&gt;finds you. Your poor brain must be mush by then, especially in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;winter (!) </i><br>
<p>
There has been a variation of the familiar animal tracking collar<br>
in use for a number of years called a "Mortality Transmitter."<br>
<p>
I remember it from a study a few years back where they put them on<br>
young moose as I recall. The transmitters would activate after a<br>
preset time of no movement. The interesting part was that<br>
helicopters dispatched to locate the transmitters often found a<br>
black bear over the carcass, subsequent investigation indicated<br>
that the black bears were far more formidable predators than<br>
previously thought, and not mere scavengers.<br>
<p>
<p>
Of course this is just more ivory tower ideological crap... ;)<br>
<p>

<p>
I particularly liked the idea of the device buzzing within a<br>
certain range of another device, just like on "Highlander" when two<br>
immortals are near.<br>
