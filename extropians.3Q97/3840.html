<i>&gt;   "A libertarian is a person who believes that no one has the right,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   under any circumstances, to initiate force against another human</i><br>
<i>&gt;   being, or to advocate or delegate its initiation. Those who act</i><br>
<i>&gt;   consistently with this principle are libertarians, whether they</i><br>
<i>&gt;   realize it or not. Those who fail to act consistently with it are</i><br>
<i>&gt;   not libertarians, regardless of what they may claim."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is an interesting and somewhat curious definition.  According to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the above it would seem that any person who applied force to stop the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rape or murder of someone they loved would not be libertarian.</i><br>
<p>
It works pretty well if you strain the definitions of "initiate" and<br>
"force" a bit.  Most libertarians would consider not only self-defense,<br>
but post-hoc retaliation (such as arrest, trial, jail, etc.) not an<br>
initiation.  And some conveniently redefine "force" to include things<br>
like intellectual property violation or blackmail to justify laws<br>
against those things.  Most also include the threat of force or<br>
reckless endangerment as "initiations of force" that one may defend<br>
or retaliate against.<br>
<p>
Complete LeFebvrian pacifists are a rare subset of libertarians.<br>
