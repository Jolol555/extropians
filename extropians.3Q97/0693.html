        Few words have as much emotional baggage as the word "ego".  The<br>
term has become so convoluted in the last century that it is now commonly<br>
accepted as a synonym to arrogance and narcissism...things that are seen as<br>
"bad" in the eyes of society.  Rick's paragraph above gives the impression<br>
that there is a contrast between "agreement on common goals" and one's ego.<br>
First of all, to have a goal, one must have his\her own reason for setting<br>
the goal...one must pursue it for his\her own self.  When, say, a thousand<br>
people have the exact same goal for their own egoistic (not to be confused<br>
with egotistic) reasons, then you have a thousand people working to make<br>
that goal reality; these are a thousand individuals --not a mass with one<br>
name: community.<br>
<p>
        Secondly, one cannot have true freedom without having ego.  If one<br>
is bound to another's ideals, he\she is just that: bound.  The only<br>
non-physical limits that exist are the ones that each individual decides to<br>
create or adhere to him\herself.  *Nothing* is blocking a person from<br>
taking a machete and decapitating his\her neighbor except for his\her own<br>
moral limitations.  Nothing is stopping me from doing 80 miles per hour in<br>
a 50mph zone...however, I must consider the consequences.  In addition,<br>
every person has freedom, however, every person has to look at the<br>
ramifications and effects that every step he\she makes will cause.  Only an<br>
individual --with an ego-- can make his\her own decisions to adhere to<br>
limits or break them.  Nothing is barring any individual from working with<br>
another person or a thousand other people, and by no means does having an<br>
ego quell productivity...quite the opposite has been proven time and time<br>
again.<br>
