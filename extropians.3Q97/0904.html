<i>&gt; If time is infinite then theoretically every eventuality will occur an</i><br>
<i>&gt; infinite number of times.</i><br>
<p>
Not necessarily, if the probability of the eventuality decays to zero<br>
fast enough.  In particular, if the universe is open, time may be infinite<br>
in the sense that the universe goes on forever, but it may be that the<br>
probability of life existing decreases towards zero, as argued by Tipler.<br>
The net result is that your chance of reincarnation may be small.<br>
<p>
However an open universe is thought (based on my dim understanding of<br>
cosmology) likely to be infinite in spatial extent, with an infinite<br>
number of stars and galaxies, all sharing our own laws of physics.<br>
Your reasoning would then apply equally well to (non-re-) incarnations<br>
occuring in an infinite number of ways across the infinity of space.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For a rerun to occur (a being that develops so similar to yourself it carries</i><br>
<i>&gt; on your consciousness) the surrounding world would have to be exact in every</i><br>
<i>&gt; detail up to the point of your death (so that the being has the same memories</i><br>
<i>&gt; and 'thinks' it is you).</i><br>
<p>
Not at all, you could be created "from scratch" as an exact match of your<br>
current body/mind.  There is no reason why the surrounding world would have<br>
to match.  You would experience a discontinuity if the external world<br>
changed, of course.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For transhumans this seems pointless as you gain</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing from it, it does hold one interesting point to all those looking</i><br>
<i>&gt; forward to an afterlife.  They will live, but they won't know they've died.</i><br>
<p>
This is only one possible circumstance, to resurrect ("surrect?") a person<br>
and allow him to live out a simulated existence which may match his earlier<br>
life.  Would they notice if the simulation did not actually match what<br>
happened before?  Not clear this question is meaningful!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Simulation as a posthumans recollection of the past, or as an experiment</i><br>
<i>&gt; could also rerun dead minds.  After simulating the consciousness of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; chosen victim, we could then put them into a steady state of evolution to</i><br>
<i>&gt; become fellow posthumans.</i><br>
<p>
Sure, this is the basic thesis of Tipler's "Physics of Immortality".  Also<br>
similar to Hans Moravec's essay in an old issue of Extropy magazine.  Ever<br>
hear of that mag?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Preserving yourself at the time of death gives you a smaller time frame in</i><br>
<i>&gt; which to be reincarnated and would hopefully mean you'd have someone around</i><br>
<i>&gt; to tell you what happened.</i><br>
<p>
The real reason is because the universe may not actually be infinite in<br>
either time or space, or conditions distant from our own may be sufficiently<br>
different that we cannot expect to experience infinite (or even many)<br>
incarnations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not dying in the first place seems like a good idea, but whatever happens</i><br>
<i>&gt; you're not going to die.  However, you might be resurrected in the year</i><br>
<i>&gt; 98,000,023, be reincarnated in a mirror universe (not that you would know) or</i><br>
<i>&gt; be subjected to some nasty multiple consciousness paradoxes.</i><br>
<p>
Tipler tries to argue that your resurrections will mostly be positive, but<br>
not many people found it convincing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In short, even if we are all immortal, it's better to be in control of your</i><br>
<i>&gt; own resurrection (especially if time turns out to be finite, in which case</i><br>
<i>&gt; we're all screwed).</i><br>
<p>
If the infinities do exist, you can only control some fraction of your<br>
incarnations.  I don't see any way to stop someone from reincarnating all<br>
possible past humans and putting them into Hell.<br>
