OK, that explanation actually makes some sense. I must admit I<br>
thought he subscribed to deterministic psychedelic evolution a la<br>
Leary (and he seems to do that in his later works, like timewave zero<br>
and his monologue on the Shamen album). <br>
<p>
The basic idea seems to be that psychotropic substances led to faster<br>
memetic evolution, which in turn led to exploration of different ways<br>
of interacting and seeing the world. His problem is to show<br>
that this actually took place.<br>
<p>
It is interesting to note that in societies where psychotropic<br>
substances are used for "mind expansion" (as opposed to<br>
entertainment, rest or social facilitation) they are seldom used by<br>
everybody, traditionally it has been the shamans or medicine men who<br>
used them (in fact, the slightly outsider medicine man seems to be an<br>
almost archetypal social figure, just as the alpha male-leader; <br>
today he exists in the form of the scientist-nerd and other forms) <br>
and then explained the visions to the tribe. This could act as a<br>
defense against dangerous exploration, it is better to loose one<br>
shaman than the whole tribe.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure I buy McKenna's theory, but it is interesting to look at<br>
memetic mutation rates across history and see how they have changed. <br>
If his theory is right then we should see the fastest memetic<br>
evolution in societies where psychotropic substances were in use and<br>
less in societies where they weren't. Is there any evidence for this? <br>
