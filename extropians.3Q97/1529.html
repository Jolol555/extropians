Since there was a flurry of discussion about Roswell and UFO's, I'd like to<br>
point to some new, relevant information.   According to a NY Times story,<br>
the CIA has declassified a report of its involvement with UFO sightings ---<br>
which were often U-2 or SR-71 sightings.  Hopefully this will clarify some<br>
past lies and help create a less paranoid discussion.  My personal hope is<br>
that further discussion will occur in some other forum.<br>
<p>
The report, "CIA's Role in the Study of UFO's, 1947-90" was written by<br>
Gerald K. Haines, a historian at the National Reconnaissance Office, the<br>
intelligence agency that builds and runs the US spy satellites.<br>
<p>
The URL of the full report is<br>

<p>
Here's a particularly interesting excerpt with stars (***) before and after<br>
what I consider the take-home message in the third paragaph:<br>
<p>
<p>
"CIA's U-2 and OXCART as UFOs <br>
<p>
In November 1954, CIA had entered into the world of high technology with<br>
its U-2 overhead reconnaissance project. Working with Lockheed's Advanced<br>
Development facility in Burbank, California, known as the Skunk Works, and<br>
Kelly Johnson, an eminent aeronautical engineer, the Agency by August 1955<br>
was testing a high-altitude experimental aircraft--the U-2. It could fly at<br>
60,000 feet; in the mid-1950s, most commercial airliners flew between<br>
10,000 feet and 20,000 feet. Consequently, once the U-2 started test<br>
flights, commercial pilots and air traffic controllers began reporting a<br>
large increase in UFO sightings. (44) (U) <br>
<p>
The early U-2s were silver (they were later painted black) and reflected<br>
the rays from the sun, especially at sunrise and sunset. They often<br>
appeared as fiery objects to observers below. Air Force BLUE BOOK<br>
investigators aware of the secret U-2 flights tried to explain away such<br>
sightings by linking them to natural phenomena such as ice crystals and<br>
temperature inversions. By checking with the Agency's U-2 Project Staff in<br>
Washington, BLUE BOOK investigators were able to attribute many UFO<br>
sightings to U-2 flights. They were careful, however, not to reveal the<br>
true cause of the sighting to the public. <br>
<p>
According to later estimates from CIA officials who worked on the U-2<br>
project and the OXCART (SR-71, or Blackbird) project, *** over half of all<br>
UFO reports from the late 1950s through the 1960s were accounted for by<br>
manned reconnaissance flights (namely the U-2) over the United States. (45)<br>
This led the Air Force to make misleading and deceptive statements to the<br>
public in order to allay public fears and to protect an extraordinarily<br>
sensitive national security project. While perhaps justified, this<br>
deception added fuel to the later conspiracy theories and the coverup<br>
controversy of the 1970s. *** ....<br>
<p>
... Dr. Leon Davidson, a chemical engineer and UFOlogist. They demanded the<br>
release of the full Robertson panel report and confirmation of CIA<br>
involvement in the UFO issue. Davidson had convinced himself that the<br>
Agency, not the Air Force, carried most of the responsibility for UFO<br>
analysis and that "the activities of the US Government are responsible for<br>
the flying saucer sightings of the last decade." Indeed, because of the<br>
undisclosed U-2 and OXCART flights, Davidson was closer to the truth than<br>
he suspected. ...."<br>
