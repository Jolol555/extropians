Sumer was a comparative nipper.  The oldest city cultures now known with<br>
any certainty are, I believe, the surprisingly precocious neolithic<br>
cultures of what used to be called Anatolia (the plains in the southern<br>
part of Turkey) - true cities like Catal Huyuk (6500BC) and Hacilar<br>
(5700BC). Jericho also has strata going back to 7000BC. Crete was kind<br>
of contemporaneous with this sort of thing as well. There were also many<br>
surprisingly large settlements along the Adriatic and in the Balkan<br>
regions. <br>
<p>
Basically, there seems to be pretty good evidence for a fairly uniform<br>
and sophisticated pre Indo-European culture across the whole Mediterranean<br>
and Balkan region from about 7000 BC to about 3500 BC, which seems to<br>
have been gradually destroyed by successive waves of invasions by<br>
bastards with bronze swords, who subsequently got to build all the<br>
monuments.  Kind of depressing really.<br>
