Dear Mr. Satterburg, Mr. Maleng and Ms. Johnson,     5 August, 1997<br>
<p>
<p>
Please accept this as formal confirmation that (inter alia) I shall be <br>
filing an Amicus Curiae brief for consideration by the relevant courts in <br>
the case of:<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
     Mary Katherine Schmitz LeTourneau:  Ref: 97-1-015 23-1 . KNT<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
<p>
As I have discussed with you all on several occasions now, this case has <br>
grave human-rights and international relevance and implications, as well <br>
as raising profound legal, hmuman rights and social issues under the laws <br>
of the State of Washington and the United States itself<br>
<p>
I owe you a preliminary explanation for my direct personal involvement in <br>
this case.  This also constitutes a statement for the relevant official <br>
records.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[A] As explained to me by Mr. Dale Foreman of the Washington State <br>
Republican Committee, the prosecution is being brought to make an example <br>
of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau. This is unacceptable. Political 'Show <br>
Trials' and witch-hunts do not form any proper part of the American legal <br>
tradition.<br>
<p>
<p>
As Mr. Satterberg will well recall, I contrasted his and his colleagues' <br>
prosecutorial zeal in in hounding a harmless female school-teacher most <br>
unfavourably vis-a-vis his and his colleagues' seeming indifference and/or <br>
reluctance to go after Microsoft Corporation and its officers (based at <br>
Redmond in Seattle, well within King County jurisdiction) for prima facie <br>
grotesque breaches of United States laws, including (inter alia) the <br>
Charter of the National Security Agency itself.<br>
<p>
This is a matter of the utmost gravity for the constitutional rights of <br>
all American Windows95 users in the US and elsewhere, who have thus been <br>
rendered vulnerable to terrorist and criminal attack.<br>
<p>
<p>
I pointed out very directly to Mr. Satterburg that many CIA and NSA <br>
staffers were well aware of (and outraged by) these matters, and he could <br>
perhaps start his invstigations by discussing these problems with them.<br>
<p>
<p>
Indeed, this whole Microsoft Corporation affair is a matter of direct <br>
and most basic concern to the entire North Atlantic Treaty Organization <br>
(NATO) and all its members.<br>
<p>
<p>
Inescapably obviously, Mr. Maleng and Mr. Satterburg are most unwilling to <br>
pursue grotesque legal infractions when they involve a major Seattle <br>
employer, powerful (and perhaps feared?) rogue elements in the intelligence <br>
and security services, and the many extremely rich and powerful interests <br>
who are gaining illicitly from criminal misconduct by enriching themselves <br>
via illegally obtained 'commercial intelligence.'<br>
<p>
'The Economist' writes: <br>
<p>
(p. 48, July 26th, 1977, "Inside the Belly of the Beast')"<br>
<p>
"When it comes to campaign finance, there is in fact a nasty, unspoken <br>
bipartisan consensus: that both parties are addicted to massive <br>
amounts of money, and they do not want to change the system that gives it <br>
to them."<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[B] The 'alternatives' presented to Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau (and the <br>
direct or indirect threats levelled against her) during the pre-trial <br>
interrogations constitute unapccptable coercion, and a violation of her <br>
rights, as well as an attempted pre-emption of the proper role of the <br>
courts.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[C] The Statute under which Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau is being accused <br>
constitutes a direct attack on the role of the Judiciary, as well as being <br>
in violation of accepted legal norms.  It is also -- in my view -- a <br>
Statute which violates the Separation of Powers by reason of the <br>
Legislature's attempting a usurpation of the the proper functions of the <br>
Judiciary to determine matters of fact, intention, and the moral content <br>
of actions.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[D] The Statute in question is quite certainly a gross example of that <br>
most evil legal positivism which characterized Nazi Germany and Stalin's <br>
USSR, whereby the 'law' was deemed to be whatever the State wanted it to <br>
be. The Statute therefore violates the jurisprudential bases and character <br>
of the entire United States legal system.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[E] The Prosecution _agrees_ that whatever took place between Mary Kay <br>
Schmitz LeTourneau and the then-13-year-old boy in the case took place <br>
without any element of coercion or other imposition of will being present. <br>
 Yet -- by direct analogy --  the Prosecution would seek to assert that <br>
(in Shakespeare's play) Romeo subjected Juliet to 'child rape', and -- in <br>
present-day Seattle -- would be coerced to plead 'guilty' to 'child rape' <br>
charges in direct and blatant contravention of the facts.<br>
<p>
Such coercion is _grossly_ improper, and is in itself tantamout to an <br>
interference with the accused's rights to plead and appeal directly to the <br>
relevant courts themselves.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[F] For a mother to be threatened with protracted and obligatory <br>
psychiatric intervention and coercion intended to 'cure' her of her love <br>
for her child's father is _completely unacceptable_ under all ethical and <br>
human-rights principles.  Such action would grossly violate the standards <br>
of medical ethics of the relevant professional bodies, and constitutes <br>
grounds for formal complaint thereto.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[G] As I have previously stated, Mr. Satterberg, Mr. Maleng and Ms. <br>
Johnson will ineluctably be held directly and personally accountable for <br>
every aspect of their actions in this (and any other relevant) case.<br>
<p>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
A TIME FOR CHOOSING:<br>
<p>
Why should I (and many others) be so concerned by the vicious prosecution <br>
of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau (and others who have physically harmed or <br>
coerced no-one)?<br>
<p>
<p>
I can find no better words than these.<br>
<p>
<p>
   "You and I have a rendezvous with Destiny.  We can preserve for our <br>
children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we can sentence them <br>
to take the first step into a thousand years of darkness.  If we fail, at <br>
least let our children and our childrens' children say of us that we <br>
justified our brief moment here.  We did all that could be done."<br>
<p>
<p>
-- Ronald Wilson Reagan, addressing the Republican Convention in Phoenix, <br>
Arizona 33 years ago, on Barry Morris Goldwater's bid for the Presidency.<br>

Yours Sincerely,<br>
<p>
