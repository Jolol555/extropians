<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Hardly necessarily.  Alongside economies of scale are prices of scale.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; An insect can get its oxygen through simple diffusion.  Big things like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; us need hearts and blood vessels to move oxygen and food around.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; large corporation needs be more complex, and thus has slower response</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; times, and administrative costs, etc.  It works well for mass producing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; standard products, poorly for high quality specialty goods.  Thus the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; failure of supermarkets to drive out all the small bread and cheese</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; stores in a well-off city.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "united we fall, when we make one dumb mistake which effects us all [see</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; China]; divided we grow, as diversity explores many different ways of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; doing something, and keeps the effects of mistakes localized, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; preserves healthy areas which can regenerate the loss."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What if some corporation doesn't make enough mistakes to fall, it will</i><br>
<i>&gt; eventualy take control of the market and then we will all suffer. In a</i><br>
<i>&gt; free-market, there will be the ones who are better than other at their</i><br>
<i>&gt; business, what if this persons are a lot better? They'll control</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything in their area.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; } Besides, many persons are also selfish and greedy. The consumer, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; } common citizen doesn't know and doesn't care about environmental issues.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Well, that explains why the Western world rose up and banned CFCs.  Must</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have been those nasty Freon producing corporations who told their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; owned governments to...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; DuPont, one, if not the, largest producer of CFCs had knowledge of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; destructive effects of CFCs on the ozone but prevented this from being</i><br>
<i>&gt; known. There are several sources claiming this. Obviously, if they knew,</i><br>
<i>&gt; others would too, they just weren't paid attention. Only when persons</i><br>
<i>&gt; started to die did the governments do something.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It remaind's me of the mad cow disease, with the information available</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the 80s it should had been taken measures to prevent people from</i><br>
<i>&gt; eating cows and yet it continued because economical pressures were more</i><br>
<i>&gt; important than the thousands that might (we don't know for sure) die</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the human form of the disease.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Governments are owned by corporations, of course that when people start</i><br>
<i>&gt; dyeing, action is taken or else no government or even corporation</i><br>
<i>&gt; resists .</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The free market of cities has done more, over time, to turn poor people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; into well-off middle class citizen than anything else.  The Church did</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not raise the poor.  Welfare has not raised the poor.  Communism -- many</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; attempts -- did not raise the poor.  It was the burgs which created the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bourgeois, who'd once been poor.  All, of course, have had some sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; law-and-order government.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The free market of cities in America has also created many poor people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Violence in America is the proof of this.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; } ask you something, do you think that the poorer classes generated by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; } free-markets will stand still? My bet is that they'll riot and that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Poverty has no causes!  Only prosperity has causes.  Poverty and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ignorance are the natural state of humanity, which we work to rise</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; above.  The market does not generate poor people; it generates poor</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; classes only insofar as it generates rich classes, creating a contrast</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with those who have not risen as far.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then why shouldn't we build condition so that all can prosper and not</i><br>
<i>&gt; just a few. It's not a communist ideology, it's a matter of assuring</i><br>
<i>&gt; basic conditions to everyone, from that to be wealthy is up to them but</i><br>
<i>&gt; let's at least assure some basic conditions.</i><br>

<i>&gt; That's an interesting point, it remaind's me of an article in my site</i><br>
<i>&gt; called "The Selfish Genius", the conclusions are roughly the same.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; I'll be honest, I don't know what negative feedback is and I know</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; competitive prices and therefore, will achieve a monopoly status.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Right?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; No.  Economies of scale don't automatically apply in every</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; industry, and there is usually a "diminishing returns" effect.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Monopolies are almost invariably the result of regulators</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; imposing barriers to entry in the market upon potential new</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; competitors.  Sometimes this is done explicitly, as with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; PTTs and many country's power industries, sometimes it is done</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in a more hidden manner, as with the banking industries, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A market in which the two or three leaders have 60% to 80%</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; market share is not a monopoly.  A PTT, on the other hand, is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; real monopoly, with all the insidious effects thereof.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If a corporation reaches monopoly in a no-rules world, it won't lose</i><br>
<i>&gt; easily and we will all suffer. A corporation with a monopoly status will</i><br>
<i>&gt; have the better research facilities, the better marketing experts, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; will even have the best criminals to take care of their opposition! It</i><br>
<i>&gt; will become unstopable.</i><br>
<p>
A corporation that reaches monopoly status becomes top heavy with<br>
management, responds slowly to changing technologies and markets, and<br>
gets beaten in the end by smaller businesses that take their place.<br>
Here's a test of your claims: name one single monopoly that is a<br>
monopoly now that was a monopoly for the past 100 years without the aid<br>
of government regulations guarranteeing that monopoly status. You can't.<br>
The closest possiblity I can see is Kellog Cereal in battle Creek,<br>
Michigan, and I don't see much technological change in breakfast cereal.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; (I see that in Portugal every time, small shops complaining about</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; big commercial centers and supermarkets)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yes, but which do the customers complain about?  Businesses</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; exist to serve consumers, not the other way around.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But if small shops go broke, the supermarkets will be able to put the</i><br>
<i>&gt; prices they want and therefore harming everybody.</i><br>
<p>
Small shops that survive do so because they sell specialty products,<br>
like gourmet coffee, cheeses, ethnic foods, etc. that large supermarkets<br>
can't sell economically. The masses that have no interest in bread and<br>
meat at gourmet prices save large amounts of money, there by raising<br>
their real disposable income and standard of living, by shopping at<br>
large discount stores for staple foods.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Since unselfish reasons rarely incentives anyone to do anything,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; let me ask you something, do you think that the poorer classes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; generated by free-markets will stand still? My bet is that they'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; riot and that is what I fear.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The poorer clases are not generated by free markets, the poorer</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; classes are generated by oppressive taxation and regulation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which hinders the market from providing them with goods, jobs,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and services.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The rules and regulations prevent the market from employing people? I</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't believe that.</i><br>
<p>
Its like this: If I've got a yard that needs to be mowed twice a month<br>
to keep it in compliance with community regulations, but the fine for<br>
not doing it is only $5 a month, then I've got to pay somebody less than<br>
or equal to $5 to keep my yard mowed, or pay the fine every month. Since<br>
it would cost me an amortized rate of $2 a month to own a lawn mower, I<br>
can economically only pay $3 or less to a laborer to keep the yard<br>
mowed. Since labor laws say I have to pay at least $5.25 an hour, but it<br>
takes at least 2 hours to mow the lawn, its not economical for me to<br>
employ somebody, so I don't. The lawn doesn't get mowed, the community<br>
morale goes down the tubes, crime goes up, and the kid I could have<br>
hired (and my neigbors could have hired for a full work week) is now<br>
mugging and killing people in the streets because laws prevented me from<br>
hiring a yard boy. ;)<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Its funny, people from other countries are dumbfounded when they hear</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that US citizens are the most generous of their time and money of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anybody in the world. THis is because when an individual pays less of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; their income to government theives, they tend to see charity as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; individual responsibility that comes with greater economic freedom.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; US citizens are the most generous of their time? I'm sorry to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; skeptical but can you prove it?</i><br>
<p>
I don't have sources here, but any study of voluntary charitable giving<br>
and volunteerism has shown that Americans are more generous than any<br>
other people, as individuals. Hell, look at your newspaper, Ted Turner<br>
(owner of CNN) just donated $1 billion to UN programs. So much for your<br>
claim of rich people being greedy robber barons.<br>
<p>
Its pretty logical, if the government were taxing the hell out of you<br>
and running a huge welfare state, how motivated would you be as an<br>
individual to give what little income remains to you to somebody on the<br>
street? The poor are being taken care of already, right? They don't need<br>
any more help from me, right? If you were free of such huge tax burdens<br>
that you never had to worry about money, wouldn't you begin to feel<br>
guilty at your good fortune when you see less fortunate people every<br>
day? Charity and generosity is contagious. Once you do it once, you feel<br>
good about it and want to do it some more. You also are an example and<br>
encourage freinds and relatives to do the same. The difference between<br>
you taking an active role in helping others and letting big brother<br>
government do it for you, is that when you do it your self, you can make<br>
the choices as to how, where and when you are going to give, and you<br>
also have a first hand experience as to what the needs of your community<br>
are, much better than some monolithic government bureaucracy hundreds or<br>
thousands of miles away.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; So it was the threat to their very lives? I dunno, we in the US have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; done some pretty good positive environmental things via market pressure.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; EXAMPLES: Recycling, Dolphin Safe Tuna, BGH free milk (which is opposed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; by big argri-corps and governments).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Market pressure or public relations. A corporation makes a positive</i><br>
<i>&gt; environmental thing, gives it a lot of publicity and then goes on</i><br>
<i>&gt; destroying the environment but since it did a good thing, it can argue</i><br>
<i>&gt; with that to continue the destruction of the environment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's not market preassure, that's cheating on the citizens (I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; generally speaking).</i><br>
<p>
Any examples? The residents of Seattle would have to disagree with you.<br>
Not counting businesses, individuals in Seattle recycle over 50% of<br>
their garbage (as do businesses). There is nobody holding a gun to their<br>
head to do it, no law, etc. people are free to recycle as much or as<br>
little as they wish.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; You talk about how the market will control big corporations and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; millions of consumers will lead the market into the best path, let me</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; ask you something, why is government so corrupt? People theoretically</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; control government (by voting) and still government is corrupt, why is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; that? What makes you think that indirect control of economy by persons</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; is going to improve anything?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Because government concentrates power in the hands of the few,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; corrupting the powerful rapidly, while indirect control dilutes power</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; into digestible, uncorruptible bite sizes for everyone.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Indirect control dilutes the power? Indirect control will make the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; welthy persons have all the power and do what they want for the harm of</i><br>
<i>&gt; consummers and general population.</i><br>
<p>
When you leave it to a free economy, as long as the populace is well<br>
informed (even though the conventional media is now mostly in the hands<br>
of multinationals, the internet has nicely sidestepped them, allowing<br>
free communication among the masses), people with power can do little<br>
wrong without the swift opposition of a large number of people.<br>
Political scientists have conlcuded that one of the biggest aids to the<br>
fall of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union was the widespread use of<br>
fax machines for instant communication, sidestepping state owned media.<br>
The Chinese apparently agree, which is why ownership of and access to<br>
fax machines and computers is regulated and licensed there.<br>
<p>
Indirect control means that because you have the most power over your<br>
won life, and are protected by what little government there is from<br>
violations of your rights by other people or by the politicians that<br>
other people buy with reelection money, or the laws those politicians<br>
pass on behalf of those people who bribed them, then you can focus on<br>
taking care of your self. People are really pretty good at taking care<br>
of themselves when they are left alone (what about homeless people etc.<br>
you say. Well, you would not beleive the programs there are in this<br>
country for helping homeless people get back on their feet. Those that<br>
remain homeless for extended periods of time are that way because they<br>
want to stay that way. Because most programs require the individual to<br>
give up booze and drugs, those that remain on the streets do so because<br>
they care more about drinking and getting high than in having a life.<br>
And don't say i don't know what I'm talking about, I was once homeless)<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I read books, I find it, however, much less boring and time consuming to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; ask other persons. Or do you read a book every time you have a doubt or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; a question?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yes I do, usually 3-6 books a week.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 6 books a week? Can you give me an autograph or let me take a picture</i><br>
<i>&gt; with you? Pretty amazing.</i><br>
<p>
Nah, just the result of growing up as an introverted geek. <br>
<p>
As Einstein said, "Why should I memorize something that I can look up in<br>
a book?"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One last thing, extropy is the opposite of entropy. Our goal is to fight</i><br>
<i>&gt; entropy or disorder and yet you defend complete disorder in the economy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
It only seems like disorder to a person with an authoritarian, linear,<br>
mindset. Seeing an economy as a highly interactive, chaotic system<br>
(chaotic in the sense of chaos mathematics, not in terms of random<br>
disorder) that responds to and generates its own positive and negative<br>
feedback allows one to conclude that control is not needed, that this<br>
"machine" is quite capable of being left alone and taking care of<br>
itself. History has shown that economic dynamism (recessions, booms,<br>
depressions, etc.) is a result of governments trying to monkey around<br>
with that system with too much positive feedback in too short a period.<br>
There is order  to a completely free economy. It is just so complex an<br>
order that most people can only see it as anarchy.<br>
