Maybe you're thinking, WHAT, again a new extropian from EUROPE on this<br>
list.<br>
I was already reading the Ex-list for while and I already knew about the <br>
list for a longer time. But lately a couple of guys and me have formed <br>
a Dutch Transhumanistic Society (or Institute, Organisation, Foundation <br>
that still has to be determined) and they are all making quite a lot <br>
of postings now, so I couldn't stay behind for long. Therefore, here my <br>
first posting to this list:<br>
<p>
Joao Pedro and Anders Sandberg discussed about rewriting the <br>
human genetic code to increase the maximum human age.<br>
<p>
<p>
My reaction to this is:<br>
<p>
<p>
It isn't neccesary to totally rewrite our complete set of genes to<br>
extend the human life. This most likely, will be an enormous complex<br>
task which, I have no doubt, will some day be possible.<br>
<p>
There are much less complex (however still not simple) ways to create<br>
physical immortality without requiring any genetic alterations (to <br>
the original code).<br>
<p>
Just restore all the cells back to their original situation at the age <br>
of 25 years (assumed they already have passed the age of 25 years). <br>
How to do this : use cell-repair-machines as described by the molecular<br>
nanotechnology concept. These machines should be able to repair all<br>
possible molecular damage created by aging (or deseases), by deducting <br>
the original structure from the damaged structure left.<br>
<p>
Damaged DNA can be repaired by comparing the DNA of several different <br>
neighbouring cells. Crossbonds can be repaired if detected. <br>
Damaged proteines can be repaired because the cell repair machines <br>
will have the programmed knowledge to detect damaged proteins <br>
and to restore the original proteines. Etc.<br>
<p>
Such a procedure of using cell repair machines should also be able to<br>
repair damage created by cryonic preservation. Remember, damage is not<br>
the same as destruction. Most (if not all) damage, created by cryonics, <br>
that will render a cell biologically non-functional, can still be <br>
repaired by cell-repair machines because the original structure <br>
can still be DEDUCTED. I might add that cell repair machines will <br>
be easily able to do that, because they will be controlled by <br>
computers (with dimensions of cubic micrometers).<br>
<p>
Joa Pedro seems to have a misconception about cryonics.<br>
I sugest Joao Pedro to read some information concerning molecular <br>
nanotechnology, to start with the books "Engines of Creation" and <br>
"Unbounding the Future", which are both available online! Many <br>
articles written by Ralph C. Merkle should also prove interesting.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; What's the difference between altering you current brain and genome, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; transferring to a new one?  Is there something special about the neurons</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that nature gave us?  And if they're so special, why don't you leave</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; them the way they are? I'm not so attached to them. As long as I can do</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; all the same things with my new consciousness-vehicle(or more things), why</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; should I care whether I've got organic axons or metal ones?</i><br>
Joao Pedro then wrote:<br>
<i>&gt;Transferring? Transferring what? Your brain? Your 'soul'?</i><br>
<i>&gt;I never understood that uploading approach. Consciousness-vehicle? What</i><br>
<i>&gt;is that? A machine with your thoughts? </i><br>
<p>
Our brain is a network of neurons, the interactions between these<br>
neurons <br>
also generate our consciousness (or soul if you prefer). From<br>
experiences <br>
with artifcial neural networks and neurobiology it is known that the <br>
behavior of the neural network is stored in it's structure (e.g. the <br>
links between the neurons and the weight factors and switching values<br>
(which are stored by proteins in the neurons) ). <br>
<p>
If we could emulate a biological neuron within certain limits, we could <br>
in principle emulate the complete brain. (After scanning the existing <br>
brain structure, which will be a bit tricky.) Research is <br>
currently being done to exactly emulate single neurons using <br>
conventional computer systems. However to upload a complete brain <br>
such systems seem to be quite inadequate. More likely<br>
to be used for this are networks of artificial neurons or neurons <br>
emulated by cellular automa (in quantum dot electronics?).<br>
<p>
(This is a bottom-up way of creating "artificial" intelligence.)<br>
<p>
With the consciousness-vehicle is meant the physical system on which <br>
the neural network is running, be it biological neurons, artificial <br>
neurons, or an electronic system emulating neurons.<br>
<p>
<p>
Joao Pedro wrote:<br>
<i>&gt;Natural selection, selects the genes that can produce the higher numbers</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the most fit offspring whereas fitness is defined as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;capacity to produce fit offspring.</i><br>
Shouldn't that be:<br>
Natural selection, selects the genes that can produce the highest<br>
numbers<br>
PER UNIT OF TIME of most fit offspring .<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Just our brain, is so much more advanced than a</i><br>
<i>&gt; frog's that the possibilities of errors are incomparable.</i><br>
Indeed, the human brain is more complex than that of a frog (or a<br>
mouse). But <br>
I seem not to be able to think of any other organs (or parts) of a human<br>
that are also much more complex.<br>
