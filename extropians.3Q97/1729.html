Good Day,<br>
 <br>
 I'm writing to receive your permission to "FAX" you (on my dime)<br>
 a sample and pricing of a very unique product that is one I sincerely feel<br>
 you could benefit from. If it's O.K. to "FAX" you a sample, simply reply<br>
 with your area code and "FAX Number".<br>
 <br>
 PHOTOSTIX(R) Laser / Ink Jet Postcards are designed 2-up on an<br>
 8 1/2" X 11" carrier sheet. Use your computer and computer printer<br>
 to create a unique message about the listing you are marketing. Take<br>
 a 35mm photo and get as many prints needed at your local<br>
 one hour photo. Then peel &amp; stick the PHOTOSTIX(R) to the backs of your<br>
 own 4" X 6" photos to turn Your Own Photos Into "Instant Postcards".<br>
 <br>
 Anyone can use PHOTOSTIX(R) to create their own "Custom Postcards"<br>
 <br>
 Think about the impact ...<br>
 For example a Realtor may use it as follows:<br>
 A prospect comes out to view a property.<br>
 Then two days later, that same person receives in their mailbox a<br>
 color postcard of "THE EXACT PROPERTY" they were inquiring about!<br>
 <br>
 There is no need to reply "Remove" if you are not interested.<br>
 This is a one time offer to "FAX" you a sample sheet and ordering<br>
 information. I'm looking forward to your reply and to sharing more<br>
 unique ways to market your listings.<br>
 <br>
 Best Wishes,<br>
 Charlie Harrison<br>
 Territory Manager<br>
