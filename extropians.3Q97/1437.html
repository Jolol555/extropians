YakWax--<br>
: [...] trying to present highly complex, world changing<br>
: technologies in a way the audience would understand.  For instance, how<br>
: do you show nano-technology or uploading in a movie (without resorting<br>
: to "I can feel something... something strange... entering... my... body...<br>
: something small... almost nanoscopical in size" or "as you can see,<br>
: virtual reality technology has progressed so far that everything in<br>
: here looks _exactly_ like it does in the real world!").<br>
<p>
Well, the goofy television serious "VR.5" (whose heroine found a way to<br>
patch herself into the subconscious mind of someone on the other end of<br>
a telephone call) conveyed the synthetic world by distorting colors (but<br>
not all colors): I happened to turn it on recently during a scene in which<br>
everyone had bright green eyes and bright orange hair.<br>
<p>
Of course, sometimes the audience isn't meant to know (until later)<br>
that reality is not reality, as in STNG's "Moriarty".<br>
<p>
Show swarms of nanobots as fractal branching structures visible only with<br>
an infrared viewer.<br>
