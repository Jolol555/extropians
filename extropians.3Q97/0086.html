For those who are interested, RAW is having two "small group discussions"<br>
in San Francisco on Saturday, August 16, for $39 each or both for $69.<br>
register to receive exact location.  $3 registration fee per order.  Phone<br>
to register with VISA, MC, AMEX:  800-909-6736 or 510-526-7190.<br>
<p>
WIL-0816A:  Saturday, August 16, 10AM - 1PM:  The I in the Triangle:  An<br>
outline of past and future evolutionary psychology, based on the works of<br>
Schoeder, Leary, and Bandler.  the theory will take the audience on a<br>
journey from the most primitive types of consciousness to the most<br>
futuristic ("New Age"), and the exercises will induce experience of the<br>
ancient oral bio-survival circuits of the brain, the mammalian anal<br>
territorial circuits, the hominid rational circuits, the domesticated<br>
social-ethical circuits, plus the futuristic neuromatic (bliss-out)<br>
circuits, the neurogenetic (Ancient Memory) circuits, the metaprogramming<br>
systems, and the non-local (cosmic) I.<br>
<p>
WIL-0816B:  Saturday, August 16, 2PM - 5PM:  The Universe Contains a Maybe:<br>
A Journey Beyond Either/Or.  An exploration of fuzzy logic, three-valued<br>
logic, multi-valued logic, and other alternatives to either/or thinking.<br>
Exercises will take the audience into tricky and sometimes funny Head Trips<br>
where these advanced scientific concepts make more sense, even in<br>
daily-life terms, than the either-or choices offered by clergypersons,<br>
politicians, and other primitives.<br>
<p>
The ad I saw mentioned him as a "guerilla ontologist, and quoted the Denver<br>
Post as calling him "the Lenny Bruce of philosophers".  Enjoy.<br>
