     I would shudder at an IQ being on a resume or job application.  A <br>
     focus on that assumes that a known/unknown/contrived IQ will actually <br>
     be appropriately applied by the potential hiree.  Working with C++ <br>
     programmers, I've hired and had to manage a number of what I observed <br>
     to be very intelligent people who were so socially inept (some with <br>
     seriously bad hygiene) as to make them veritably useless in teamwork <br>
     scenarios.  <br>
     <br>
     IQ is only one aspect of a person's value and qualifications.  I liked <br>
     what the book "Emotional Intelligence" had to offer in that respect.  <br>
     <br>
     If one's "intelligence quotient" is all a person has to offer, it's <br>
     not a good balance by my perspective.  That is, unless the person's <br>
     only responsibility is to interact with silicon-based life forms.  The <br>
     carbon-based ones require a little more interactivity.<br>
     <br>
     A interesting coincidental footnote:  i.q. is also a Latin <br>
     abbreviation meaning "the same as".  A curious connection to the <br>
     measurable "sameness" that is all an IQ test can ultimately provide.<br>
     <br>
