Since the conversation between John K Clark and Brent Allsop seems to<br>
have collapsed into agreement on a statement that I vigorously disagree<br>
with, I thought I'd just inject a little noise into the system  ;)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; "the only feelings I can objectively observe is my own"</i><br>
<p>
Precisely the opposite is true. I can't think of any reason to believe<br>
that anyone could objectively observe anything happening inside the<br>
very instrument they are observing with. One can observe one's own <br>
feelings, but one cannot do so objectively, at least not without doing<br>
great violence to the ordinary-usage sense of the English word <br>
"objective" as it is usually applied to the word "observation".<br>
<p>
So the proper statement would be "the only feelings I can never hope to<br>
observe *objectively* are my own". I'm not sure whether this supports<br>
Allsop's point or Clark's, but I'd be interested to see what they think<br>
of it.<br>
