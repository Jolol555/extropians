In a message dated 97-09-08 22:18:36 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; Also there may be less of a chance that you'll get saved in an accident<br>
<i> &gt; because in the back of their mind they know that you're an organ donor.</i><br>

 <br>
 I've never understood why people think this.  (I believe Hagbard Celine is<br>
 correct to label it a myth.)<br>
 <br>
 From the EMT or paramedic's perspective, if a person is an organ donor, it<br>
 means you *continue* to give CPR, even when the person seems unsalvageable.<br>
  But there are very few cases in which EMT's are allowed to withhold this<br>
 care, anyway (decapitation, rigor, total-body-cruch, etc.), so they would<br>
 do that either way if there was no obvious reason not to.  As for ER<br>
 doctors, their strongest motivation, for a variety of reasons, is to save<br>
 every person who can be saved.  Unless there is some conspiracy (where the<br>
 doctor is being bribed by someone), there is much more value to the doctor<br>
 in adding one saved ER life to his tally than there is in adding one ER<br>
 death and one successfully donated organ.  MUCH more value.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I didnt mean that they intentionally would want them to die, just that they<br>
have the thought "well, if this one dies, there's always the organ", which<br>
may affect his/her surgical procedures, maybe not.<br>
