Roderick A. Carder-Russell writes (initially quoting Rucker):<br>
<i> &gt; 	"I would respond that omega is a _given_, an object of our</i><br>
<i> &gt; immediate pre-rational experience.  And to use the tools of symbolic</i><br>
<i> &gt; logic to investigate an _empirically_ existing phenomenon..."</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; It seems to me that he is at first asserting that the concept of</i><br>
<i> &gt; omega exists a priori.  He then goes on to speak of it further as</i><br>
<i> &gt; an empirical phenomenon, certainly in clear contradiction of the</i><br>
<i> &gt; first statement.  Any thoughts on this?  Could I be correct, or am</i><br>
<i> &gt; I missing something in the text?</i><br>
<p>
This is the kind of thing that Kant invented the phrase<br>
"synthetic a priori" to cover. It looks like Rucker is asserting<br>
that omega belongs to the synthetic a priori, although he may<br>
not *intend* to have done so...<br>
<p>
I find Paul Churchland's discussion of these Kantian categories<br>
(presented along with his theory of semantics in his monograph<br>
SCIENTIFIC REALISM AND THE PLASTICITY OF MIND) most<br>
illuminating, if anyone cares. The theory of semantics proposed<br>
in that monograph is significantly fleshed out in Churchland's<br>
later more neurocomputationally-focused books.<br>
<p>
Rucker's metaphysical poetry you quote here reminds me of Pirsig's<br>
"Quality". The closer philosophers try to get to what they think<br>
really matters, the more abstract and colorless their vocabulary<br>
gets. This has always disturbed me, and probably accounts for my<br>
pluralistic hunches that the Good is not something capable of<br>
detailed unitary representation within an ape brain. In Minskyan<br>
terms, I see the Good as an accumulation. (ref. Society of<br>
Mind.)<br>
<p>
I don't know whether subscribing to Kantian metaphysics is<br>
necessarily self-contradictory, although many people seem to<br>
think so. Kant's popularity waxes and wanes, but most people of<br>
libertarian political bent find it difficult to disagree with<br>
Kant's moral maxim that a person is an end in emself.<br>
<p>
(New problem: what is a person? The old definition--a person is a<br>
mature, sane ape of species Homo sapiens--was already rife with<br>
problematics probed by Foucault and Szasz and others, and now may,<br>
for the first time in millenia, be threatened by obsolescence.<br>
The best replacement we have available, it seems, is the Turing<br>
test, which is neither more nor less than a straightforward<br>
bootstrapping from the old definition. The Turing test says: if<br>
a new system can fool one of the systems that we would have<br>
called a "person" under the old definition into believing that<br>
the new system is a person, then the new system is a person<br>
under the new, Turing-test definition. Of course, the details<br>
are much messier than that, but even simplified that much it<br>
looks pretty kludgy.)<br>
<p>
Oops. I started out addressing a technical point and wandered<br>
off into a heavy philosophical problem on a digression. I do<br>
that sometimes. Sorry.<br>
