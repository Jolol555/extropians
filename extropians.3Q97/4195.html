<p>
Dear Mr. Maleng,<br>
<p>
<p>
      Thank you so very much for speaking with me earlier this morning.<br>
<p>
<p>
      I am not fighting you.<br>
<p>
<p>
      I am fighting _for_ the Constitution of the United States of <br>
America; and _for_ the rights of all Americans (indeed, everyone <br>
everywhere) -- yourself included -- to life, liberty and the pursuit of <br>
happiness.<br>
<p>
      It is to this cause that I have long pledged my life, my fortune and <br>
my sacred honour.<br>
<p>
<p>
      I _love_ Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau. And I shall rebuild  -- with <br>
all my care and resources and intelligence (as well as the resources of my <br>
friends and associates) -- as much of the damage she and all five of her <br>
children have suffered.  As far as this may be possible...<br>
<p>
      Had she lost Audrey Lokelani under the trauma of the ordeal she was <br>
subjected to, your young daughter Karen would never have allowed you to <br>
forget it or to be able to live with the knowledge.  We may thank God that <br>
did not happen.<br>
<p>
      With hindsight, if Mary Kay had divorced her husband Steve after he <br>
had tried to make her kill her unborn baby ("your nigger baby' in his <br>
vicious words) and afterr he had repeatedly and with increasing <br>
brutality physically attacked her during her pregnancy, she and the <br>
alleged "victim" in this case could have travelled to Spain, married fully <br>
leagally civilly or in Church under Spanish law (the age of consent in <br>
Spain is 12 years of age), returned to Seattle and lived openly as husband <br>
and wife in a Full Faith and Credit marriage, recognized under Federal <br>
law.<br>
<p>
<p>
      The Washington State statute under which she is charged has fatal <br>
Constitutional flaws, as has the conduct of the Prosecutiion.  I can apply <br>
forthwith directly to the Supreme Court of the United States, asking them <br>
to issue a writ of certiorari.<br>
<p>
<p>
      However, Mary Kay has said that she would rather serve _seven and a <br>
half years of imprisonment_ than allow violent child rapists convicted and <br>
imprisoned under the statute to be thus freed along with her.<br>
<p>
<p>
      Should Mary Kay's -- coerced -- plea be upheld on October 17, and <br>
should she be sentenced, it is my understanding that her conviction and <br>
any sentence would be struck down immediately on appeal.<br>
<p>
      Amnesty International's American Desk has told me that any attempt <br>
whatsoever to coerce Mary Kay into any 'psychiatric sex offender program' <br>
(which could only have the intention of damaging her love for the father <br>
of her baby) would result in Amnesty's immediately gazetting her as a <br>
prisoner of conscience across the world.<br>

      Valery Senderov, a mathematician and physicist, is a Russian <br>
dissident we fought for (with his associates) at the height of the Cold <br>
War.  He was tried at the Moscow City Court on February 28, 1983.<br>
<p>
<p>
      The following report is excerpted from: "Russian Free Trade Unions <br>
and the Trial of Valery Senderov",  by my colleague George Miller, who was <br>
for three years Senior Research officer with the institute for European <br>
Defence and Strategic Sudies ("Heritage UK") before becoming Editor of <br>
"Soviet Labour Review". He was Secretary of the East European <br>
Sub-Committee of the Foreign Affairs Panel of the Liberal Pary in the UK.  <br>
Mr. Miller is also British Representative of NTS, the principal <br>
anti-Soviet resistance organization which is active within Russia.<br>
<p>
<p>
" ... the Court was thrown into confusion when Valery Senderov did not <br>
dispute the facts put forward by the prosecution.  The 38-year-old editor <br>
of the SMOT (Free Independent Professional Association of Workers) <br>
Bulletin justified his actions by saying that he would not be found guilty <br>
in any democratic country.  Senderov told Judge romanov that he accepted <br>
the factual evidence presented by prosecutor Golybe but added:<br>
<p>
<p>
      "I do not count myself guilty."<br>
<p>
...<br>
<p>
      "The whole trial was very quickly rushed through with the minimum <br>
amount of fuss.  Indeed, Senderov's relatives were only informed of the <br>
impending trial a few days before it actually took place.  That suggests <br>
that the Soviet authorities could not break Senderov during his eight <br>
month detention.<br>
<p>
<p>
      "Senderov's trial and his behaviour during it is nevertheless an <br>
important development for the russian opposition.  The fact that Senderov <br>
did not play the Soviet "legalistic" game ... makes it the most important <br>
landmark in the historical development of the Russian opposition since the <br>
Sinyavsky-Daniel trial of 1965.  The outspoken anti-Soviet attitude of <br>
Valery Senderov is a far cry from the 'human-rights' movement, who claim <br>
to be acting within Soviet laws.  Senderov, by arguing that the laws <br>
themselves are unjust and based on false premises, has become an example <br>
to follow..."  -- From  "Free Life"  Volume 3 No. 3/4, July [1983], edited <br>
by Tony Hollick and Chris R. Tame.<br>

years a legendary Direcor, CIA Counter-Intelligence.  (See the chapter, <br>
"The Theorist" in Robin Winks' fine study, "Cloak and Gown").  He has <br>
asked for papers concerning the case.<br>
<p>
<p>
   As well as with many other people.<br>

      had been but a preparation for this hour and this trial."<br>
