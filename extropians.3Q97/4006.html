A *very* large airship. That's definitely a niche application. <br>
 <br>

<p>
But an airship will be much larger than an equivalent fixed-wing aircraft<br>
and fly lower, will therefore produce more drag, and hence require more<br>
power to sustain the same speed *and* be lower so the noise will be worse. <br>
You only save on power by reducing speed and increasing the travel time. <br>
<p>

<p>
Then why haven't they? As you said, we can build them today, but we're<br>
not. The most probable answer is that a) they're too slow and b) they're<br>
too expensive. As far as I'm aware, the major expense in operating a<br>
modern jet is the cost of leasing it, and this is why airlines fly them as<br>
often as possible. An airship travelling at 150 mph would have to be far<br>
cheaper to lease per ton-mile than a 747 at 500 mph, even if it did use<br>
less fuel.<br>
<p>
Airships are cool, but I really doubt they're economically feasible on a<br>
large scale. One thing I have been impressed by lately is the 'Moller<br>
Skycar', at <a href="http://www.moller.com;">http://www.moller.com;</a> a four-seat VTOL aircraft somewhat<br>
larger than a four-seat sedan, which should get 15 miles-per-gallon at 350<br>
mph. They claim the prototype will fly soon, but the $1 million price-tag<br>
is a bit annoying. <br>
