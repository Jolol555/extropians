Why? In general the more advanced our commercial vehicles get the more<br>
reliable they are, if properly maintained. Modern cars are far more<br>
reliable than they were twenty years ago, and a 747 is far more reliable<br>
than a Dragon Rapide... Modern commercial aircraft almost never crash if<br>
they're maintained correctly. Why should alien spacecraft be any different<br>
(I'll give you the possibility that they *are* military, early models or <br>
government vehicles like the shuttle)? <br>

<p>
Interestingly, Lockheed were able to provide better SR-71 maintenance (and<br>
the SR-71 was far ahead of its time, let alone cutting edge) for the CIA<br>
with a very small group of Lockheed technicians than the USAF could manage<br>
with far more people (I think the figures were something like five<br>
Lockheeders vs fifty USAF), so military experience may not tell us much.<br>
And shuttle maintenance is notoriously bloated... <br>
