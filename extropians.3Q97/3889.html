As a contractor and business owner, I am very aware of the costly and <br>
debilitating impact of regulations and the tax code.  <br>
<p>
Regulations and tax code were what I was talking about when I stated that<br>
in the current market<br>
low informational viscosity and technological agility were overshadowed by<br>
more sinister factors.<br>
<p>
Conversely, even a nearly free market would play hell with the IRS because<br>
the tax codes would be a<br>
nightmare to enforce in their current state.  Thats why Internet commerce<br>
disturbs them so much...<br>
