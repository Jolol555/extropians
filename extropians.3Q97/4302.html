No, I would NOT be willing to give 2-1 odds in making a bet that the coin will<br>
land tails.  IT'S A FAIR COIN!  If you ever have yourself saying that a coin<br>
has a 2/3 chance of *landing* tails, not just of having *landed* tails, you<br>
have left the realms of sanity!<br>
<p>
Besides, the experimenter makes a bet with one person, in each case.  If the<br>
coin lands tails, he makes a bet with the uncloned.  If it lands heads, he<br>
makes a bet with the original.  In either case he makes one bet.  From his<br>
point of view, he should bet at 1/2 odds.  If I'm told that I am not the<br>
clone, then I should also bet at 1/2 odds.  Therein lies the paradox:  When I<br>
am told that I am not cloned, have I learned information about the coin-flip<br>
or only about myself?<br>
<p>
And if I'm not told that I'm the clone, what should I bet that I was cloned? <br>
<i>&gt;From the experimenter's view, he should gain $200 from the uncloned and lose</i><br>
$100 to each of the cloned, so I should bet $200 against $100 that the coin<br>
landed heads.  But I haven't gained any additional information!<br>
<p>
One of the problems with this scenario is the existence of a clone.  This<br>
confuses everything.  My situation:<br>
<p>
I agree to be part of a research experiment.  I am told that a coin was<br>
flipped.  If it came up heads, only I, Person A, was selected to take part in<br>
the experiment.  If it came up tails, two people were selected to take part in<br>
the experiment, one of them being "Person B".<br>
<p>
What is the probability that the coin came up heads?<br>
What is the probability that I am person B?<br>
If I am not person B, what is the probability the coin came up heads?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In effect, cloning makes it a non-zero-sum game.  The changes introduced</i><br>
<i>&gt; by cloning in potential future earnings cause the gains or losses of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; bet to be evaluated differently.  The result is that it may be rational</i><br>
<i>&gt; to take a bet which gives an expected profit to the other player.</i><br>
<p>
I think the cloning is a side issue.<br>
But:  In the scenario above, there was the possibility that I would not be<br>
person A.  If cloned, someone is always a person A.  Either my selection<br>
provides me with information I did not have (I might not have been selected),<br>
or being person A provides me with information I did not have (I might have<br>
been person B).  Only with cloning, perhaps, can I - or one of me - always be<br>
told "You exist and are not person B".<br>
