No question the success of the west is due to too many contingencies for<br>
any theory (that isn't more than a vacuous laudatio or rationalization for<br>
abuses) to really manage to properly grab hold of them all.  One possible<br>
influence that interests me is that in the aftermath of the decline and<br>
fall of the Roman Empire, Western Europe was never able to reconsolidate<br>
itself into a polity with that kind of cohesion and yet was haunted by the<br>
memory (or at the least the fantasy) of it.  The nation-state system was a<br>
system that yielded an interminable competition of powers as well as a<br>
measure of sociocultural consistency -- a state of affairs that has been<br>
exacerbated by the principal institutional developments since: separation<br>
of church and state, separation of powers more generally, rise of reading<br>
publics, rise of industrial civilization and finer-grained division of<br>
labor, emergence of glabal media, multinational corporations and crime<br>
cartels, e-cash, and -- soon enough -- the kind of radicalization of the<br>
separation of powers one finds in works like David Friedman's.  The fact<br>
that in the West the nation-state system immediately incubated a number of<br>
rather brutal imperialisms has no little part in the explanation as to why<br>
*after* the West won, it *remained* a "winner" for so long -- but this is<br>
scarcely the only or exhaustive explanation.  The point is that the West<br>
hit (probably inadvertantly) on the trick that pluralism *produces* power<br>
rather than inhibiting it.  This is a larger, tho' obviously related,<br>
point than simply that competition produces greater efficiency, imo. <br>
Best, Dale <br>
PS: By the way, returning for a moment to David Friedman, what *does* the<br>
list think of the idea that it is best to say that Friedman's model is<br>
not in stricto senso anarchist since it is more (at least the way we would<br>
read it today, after understanding cryptomarkets) a sketch of the<br>
institutions of rational governance that are most likely to *remain* in<br>
the aftermath of the decline of the Weberian nation-state than it is a<br>
blueprint for smashing the state?  Best, Dale<br>
