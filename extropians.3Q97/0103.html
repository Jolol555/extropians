No, you won't, because it contradicts your beliefs and won't let a few<br>
facts change them. Here's a cite for my "facts", and I was wrong... they<br>
aren't twice as likely to kill an innocent bystander, they're *5.5* times<br>
as likely to do so: <br>
<p>
Silver and Kates, "Handgun Ownership, Self-Defense and the Independence of<br>
Women in a Violent, Sexist Society", in 'Restricting Handguns', p 154-155. <br>
<p>
Kates at least is a criminologist and constitutional lawyer who's been<br>
studying the effects of gun laws for decades. Unfortunately I don't have<br>
access to a law library or I'd find the original article for you. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Particularly, when their is so much data about improper</i><br>
<i>&gt; use of firearms under stress.</i><br>
<p>
Cite? Odd that when this data is supposedly so widespread I've been unable<br>
to find it. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As far as I'm concerned, the less guns we have the better off we are.</i><br>
<p>
Shame that most of the independent criminologists like Kleck (don't know<br>
if Kates gets any funding from pro-gun groups) disagree: <br>
<p>
"Gun control is a very minor, though not entirely irrelevant, part of the<br>
solution to the violence problem, just as guns are of only very minor<br>
significance as a cause of the problem.  The U.S. has more violence than<br>
other nations for reasons unrelated to its extraordinarily high gun<br>
ownership.  Fixating on guns seems to be, for many people, a fetish which<br>
allows them to ignore the more intransigent causes of American violence,<br>
including its dying cities, inequality, deteriorating family structure,<br>
and the all-pervasive economic and social consequences of a history of<br>
slavery and racism." <br>
