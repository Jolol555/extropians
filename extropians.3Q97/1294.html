Think about this...<br>
<p>
If you wanted to see a universe where I didn't write this post, you would<br>
have to change a few things:<br>
<p>
-- Me wanting to send the post - All that behavioural stuff in my brain that<br>
made me want to reply to your post, which would mean...<br>
<p>
-- Changing my environment - To make me make a different decision you would<br>
have to change my environment, including every person I have ever come in<br>
contact with.<br>
<p>
-- Changing their environment - You would have to change the environment of<br>
every person I came into contact with, which would mean changing all the<br>
people they have come into contact with...<br>
<p>
[changing people, animals, plants and various sea life for a very long time]<br>
<p>
-- Eventually you'd be back at the start of space/time, changing the very<br>
first glimmer of movement.<br>
<p>
Of course, that's if there is a start.  If there is a start, then because<br>
there could be no cause for any one effect, every possibility must have<br>
happened.  This gives you infinite universes, not one of which is remotely<br>
similar to our own (Which IMO makes them far more interesting).  As per<br>
usual, I could be wrong.<br>
