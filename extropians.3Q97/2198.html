Look up "Hamming distance" in any computer hardware text. Conceptually,<br>
Its fairly straigtforward, but the details are a bit awkward. Caution:<br>
theory and practice diverge considerably in current practice: about<br>
half of all attempts to recover from backups fail due to procedural<br>
mishaps, because recovery is a rare operation and the administrators<br>
are not used to it. Funny thing: in the 1960's, Burroughs mainframes<br>
had extremely reliable recovery mechanisms that nearly always worked.<br>
They had to, because the hardware was unreliable enough that recovery<br>
was a relatively frequent operation. I think you need to factor this<br>
into you calculations. For example, you may want to run your galaxy<br>
with the ability to detect errors in pairs instead of just single<br>
errors (in each block) then, you can continously induce single errors<br>
to verify that the backup system is working. This continuous effort will<br>
occupy resources over and above the resourced needed for the redundant<br>
data<br>
encoding.<br>
