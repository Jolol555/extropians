As for inflation, there's been recent official talk that inflation may<br>
have been overestimated by a percentage point.  If this was true in the<br>
past then wages won't be so bad.  And considering that electronics,<br>

Of course they feel they have less job security.  Every time GM laid off<br>

No human need be unnecessary in the absence of orders of magnitude<br>
