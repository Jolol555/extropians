For a couple of weeks now I have not been able to send mail to the<br>
extropians list from my home system.  I think I may know the reason<br>
why now.<br>
<p>
I have a Linux system which connects via a dial-up line to a local ISP,<br>
rain.org.  I connect a few times a day for an hour or so to get mail<br>
and check the web.<br>
<p>
My machine has never been configured quite right.  In particular, I've<br>
never known what to put for the hostname and fully qualified domain name.<br>
I don't have a registered domain name, so I just made one up:<br>
crypt.hfinney.com.  For the most part this has not caused problems; my<br>
outgoing mail shows my return address as hal@rain.org, and I use a POP<br>
client to pick up my mail from rain.org and download to my Linux system.<br>
<p>
Mail to from rain.org to extropians worked, but mail from my Linux<br>
system (which uses rain.org as an SMTP mail server) does not.  I am able<br>
to send mail to other addresses, though.  Sending mail to extropians and<br>
cc'ing it to other addresses gets to the other addresses OK, but it does<br>
not show up on extropians.<br>
<p>
This suggested that the extropians list was rejecting my mail when it<br>
came from my Linux system but accepting it when it came from rain.org.<br>
The only real difference (I think) is that a couple of the headers are<br>
different.  There is an extra Received header when I send from Linux,<br>
claiming the mail came from crypt.hfinney.com, and the Message-ID also had<br>
that domain name.  I thought perhaps the extropians software was trying to<br>
do a DNS lookup on that name, and not finding it, was rejecting the mail.<br>
<p>
To try this, I changed my hostname to s27.term1.sb.rain.org.  This is<br>
typical of the dynamic hostnames assigned by the PPP server on rain.org.<br>
Each time I dial in I will get a slightly different address, with the s27<br>
replaced by whatever port I land on.  Nevertheless this is a typical name<br>
and a DNS lookup on it should succeed.<br>
<p>
Since I've made that change, all my mail to extropians has gone through.<br>
Now I don't know for sure that this change was the cause; it's also<br>
possible that some other change was made simultaneously that actually<br>
was the fix.  I will need to try changing the host name back and see if<br>
it makes a difference.<br>
<p>
But for other people who have been having problems getting through to the<br>
list, if you have any bogus hostnames, you might see if this is the cause.<br>
It would also be interesting to know if there were any changes made to the<br>
list software about two weeks ago which might have made it pickier about<br>
domain names in some header fields.<br>
