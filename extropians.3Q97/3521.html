THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU!<br>
<p>
A big hug to John K. Clark (assuming he wants one)!<br>
<p>
I spent all these years thinking that people who fell into a black<br>
hole would be torn apart, when actually they would be crushed together!<br>
This explanation is great!<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;black whole tear the intrepid astronaut to bits?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If no force is acting on the astronaut except gravity, that is, if he's</i><br>
<i>&gt;freely falling, then ever particle in the poor man is moving in parallel</i><br>
<i>&gt;straight lines, or rather the analog of parallel straight lines when you're</i><br>
<i>&gt;dealing with curved surfaces, a geodesic. 4 dimensional spacetime can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;thought of as the surface of a 5 dimensional sphere, but that can't really be</i><br>
<i>&gt;visualized so consider the 2 dimensional surface of a 3 dimensional sphere,</i><br>
<i>&gt;like the earth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If I'm on the equator and want to go to the north pole by the shortest route</i><br>
<i>&gt;then there is only one path I can follow, a geodesic. Suppose I have company</i><br>
<i>&gt;on my trip because my neighbor, also on the equator 10 miles west of me,</i><br>
<i>&gt;is going to the pole by the shortest route too. Both out paths are absolutely</i><br>
<i>&gt;perpendicular to the equator and at first, when we've only gone a short</i><br>
<i>&gt;distance, my path and that of my neighbor seem absolutely parallel too, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;as we continue our journey we start to get closer together until at the pole</i><br>
<i>&gt;we collide. There was no force pushing us together, it's just what happens</i><br>
<i>&gt;when 2 people follow a geodesic on a sphere. Even if we were 2  dimensional</i><br>
<i>&gt;creatures incapable of visualizing the third dimension we could still deduce</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the ground must be curved in that mysterious direction because we find</i><br>
<i>&gt;that parallel straight lines converge if they're long enough, if fact that's</i><br>
<i>&gt;what is mente by a surface being curved.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;At fist our astronaut feels no force as he falls into the central point of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the black hole, the singularity, because all his parts are moving straight</i><br>
<i>&gt;and parallel, and if space was flat things would stay that way, but it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;curved and the curve is increasing. Despite moving in parallel his parts are</i><br>
<i>&gt;nevertheless getting closes together and will continue to do so until every</i><br>
<i>&gt;particle in his body occupies exactly the same point in spacetime, he'd be</i><br>
<i>&gt;crushed to death long before that of course.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;When space-time distorts, as I understand it, 'new' space-time is</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;not created, existing space-time merely stretches. But it</i><br>
<i>&gt;stretches</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;only in the context of an external point of view. Anything within</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;that space-time would not see the stretching</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If our astronaut was the size of a mathematical point then he would feel no</i><br>
<i>&gt;force and have no problem, but he's so big that his head and feet are in</i><br>
<i>&gt;VERY different reference frames, and that's not healthy for our poor friend.</i><br>
