<i>&gt; Now if I am interpreting what I read of Minsky's view of an illusory</i><br>
<i>&gt; protagonist that we call our self and Watts view that there is no sort</i><br>
<i>&gt; of "proprietary" and individual soul, spook, or ghost, what would be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sense of thinking of uploading our wetware to have eternal existence?  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; mean,  that which  is in our brains, that we identify as our proprietary</i><br>
<i>&gt; selves is illusory, consisting of data input over our lifetimes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; According to Minsky and Watts there is no "you".</i><br>
<p>
Minsky doesn't say there is no "you", just that this "you" is<br>
a society of agents; after all, nobody would say Micro$oft doesn't<br>
exist because it has no existence without a lot of its internal<br>
agents, it is a very real force and can be treated as an "individual"<br>
being. It is all a matter of on what level you want to discuss<br>
things; from my vantage point it is practical to chunk all of<br>
your agents into a single "you" since right now there is no need<br>
to look closely at these agents (which consist of subagents, which<br>
consists of neurons...)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps Extropians should be thinking of Moravec's mind children and</i><br>
<i>&gt; instead of seeking eternal individual existence, just merge into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Matrix what we can contribute.</i><br>
<p>
That depends on what kind of organisations of information we like.<br>
There are likely advantages both in being a "functional soup" or<br>
a well delineated individual. I'm going to try both. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Some form of</i><br>
<i>&gt; written Chinese would also be a marvelous language for computers,</i><br>
<i>&gt; because it can be read at high speed, and because each character, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideogram, is a nonlinear Gestalt, or configuration."</i><br>
<p>
Of course, that is the big problem with Chinese: the keyboard would<br>
have to be extremely complex, or allow phonetic spelling like som<br>
Japanese keyboards. Doable today, but might decrease the usefulness. <br>
