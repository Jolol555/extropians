I should say:  menthally chid...<br>
<p>
By the way, all the religious ( even I, when was one of them...) are<br>
programmed to behave like children (remember, f. ex., "St"Paul in lots of<br>
his letters :  "little children....", or the imitated "son of  "god"  " ) .<br>
But note the (unconscious) logical incoherencies associated to such "adult<br>
x+ children" dual behaviour leads one to several emotional (and lots of<br>
logical) disadjustments... transposed to all other fields of existence...<br>
and democratic (not necessarily inteligent) exercises ( more exercises than<br>
real solutions...) . Indeed, I even think that, if the religious wouldn't<br>
have assumed such posture of considering themselves like children, the<br>
intelectual "fathers" wouldn't be so "paternalists" with them.... (just the<br>
corrupted  and very interested on such status quo...)<br>

Libertary ???:  or 100% or not yet...but always peacefully... (just some<br>
little slaps, sometimes...)<br>
