Mark Grant:<br>
: You seem to be under the impression that kids are<br>
: somehow rational, civilised people with whom you can "negotiate<br>
: disputes", and ignore the rather obvious fact that most kids are<br>
: far more vicious and irrational than most adults.<br>
<p>
[tale of violence elided]<br>
<p>
Kathryn Aegis:<br>
: Again, I am sorry for your bad experiences as a child, and I think <br>
: that most of us can share the same type of story.  I do not, however, <br>
: equate that experience with general childhood disputes. <br>
<p>
Can it be separated from them?<br>
<p>
: The learning of basic negotiation skills is a vital component to any<br>
: child's development, to the extent that most childhood development<br>
: books will devote at least a chapter to it. <br>
<p>
Hm.  I wish I'd learned better to negotiate with adults.<br>
Still can't do it comfortably.  I'm good at retreat, though.<br>
<p>
: As for your 'obvious fact' above, I would ask that you provide some<br>
: definite support for that statement, outside of your personal<br>
: experience, in order to consider it a general truism.<br>
<p>
Mark Grant:<br>
: Uh, my experience, my friends' experiences, the experiences of those on<br>
: this list... the only people I've met who didn't have similar tales to<br>
: tell were either home-schooled or went to expensive private schools. <br>
<p>
I feel left out.  (I usually feel left out, dammit.)<br>
I never got beat up, scrawny though I was.  <br>
In third or fourth grade I once fought Peter Benesch one-on-one.  <br>
(Gave him a black eye, or so he claimed; I never saw the shiner.)<br>
<p>
Fifth/sixth grade (different town) was marginally worse.<br>
On one occasion during recess my peers pushed me into a "fight" with <br>
a classmate's kid sister.  <br>
On my way home a neighborhood bully tried on two occasions to pick <br>
a fight, but I baffled him by not knowing the conventions.  I suppose<br>
he decided I was a sissy not worth scuffing his shoes.<br>
And - I almost forgot - while waiting for the school bus in the morning,<br>
I once stood by impotent while bullies made my sister lick spit off the <br>
pavement.<br>
<p>
After that I was in an elite experimental school attached to the university,<br>
where violence was simply infra dig.<br>
