<i>&gt;       ONE NOW FASHIONABLE SUGGESTION I FIRST PROPOSED IN 1960 IS</i><br>
<i>&gt;      THAT THE HIGH TEMPERATURES ON THE SURFACE OF VENUS ARE DUE TO A</i><br>
<i>&gt;      RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE EFFECT.  (All emphasis added and deserved)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      "First, Sagan claims that Dr. Velikovsky does not deserve</i><br>
<i>&gt;      credit for predicting high temperatures on Venus because</i><br>
<i>&gt;      everybody knew it, although historical fact shows that only Dr.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Wildt had made the same prediction before Velikovsky.  Then</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Sagan either tells a double lie or else suffers an alarming</i><br>
<i>&gt;      memory lapse that may require neurological consultation claiming</i><br>
<i>&gt;      that neither Dr. Wildt nor Dr. Velikovsky had made this</i><br>
<i>&gt;      prediction (which they had, and he had noted earlier) -- and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      then he brazenly claims he had originated it himself.  Quite a</i><br>
<i>&gt;      performance wouldn't you say?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	- Robert Anton Wilson, "The Astronomer Who Abolished Gravity,"</i><br>

<p>
I'm not familiar with the details of this controversy, but I can read<br>
what is written above.  Sagan is not claiming to have predicted high<br>
temperatures.  He is taking credit for offering a specific explanation<br>
of the high temperatures, namely that they were caused by a runaway<br>
greenhouse effect.  Wilson is wrong to say that Sagan is claiming that<br>
he originated the prediction that Venus would have high temperatures.<br>
