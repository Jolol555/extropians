<i>&gt;&gt;Have you ever heard the story of the broken window, BTW?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Actually, I have never heard the story of the broken window. Please</i><br>
<i>&gt;enlighten me.</i><br>
<p>
OK, here's the story of the broken window:-<br>
<p>
"A young hoodlum, say, heaves a brick through the window of a baker's<br>
shop.  The shopkeeper runs out furious, but the boy is gone.  A crowd<br>
gathers, and begins to stare with quiet satisfaction at the gaping hole<br>
in the window and the shattered glass over the bread and pies.  After a<br>
while the crowd feels the need for philosophic reflection.  And several<br>
of its members are almost certain to remind each other or the baker that,<br>
after all, the misfortune has its bright side.  It will make business<br>
for some glazier.  As they begin to think of this they elaborate upon<br>
it.  How much does a new plate glass window cost?  Two hundred and fifty<br>
dollars?  That will be quite a sum.  After all, if windows were never<br>
broken, what would happen to the glass business?  Then, of course, the<br>
thing is endless.  The glazier will have $250 more to spend with other<br>
merchants, and these in turn will have $250 more to spend with still<br>
other merchants, and so ad infinitum.  The smashed window will go on<br>
providing money and employment in ever-widening circles.  The logical<br>
conclusion from all this would be, if the crowd drew it, that the little<br>
hoodlum who threw the brick, far from being a public menace, was a<br>
public benefactor.<br>
<p>
"Now let us take another look.  The crowd is at least right in its first<br>
conclusion.  This little act of vandalism will in the first instance<br>
mean more business for some glazier.  The glazier will be no more<br>
unhappy to learn of the incident than an undertaker to learn of a death.<br>
 But th shopkeeper will be out $250 that he was planning to spend for a<br>
 new suit.  Because he has had to replace a window, he will have to go<br>
 without the suit (or some equivalent need or luxury).  Instead of<br>
 having a window and $250 he now has merely a window.  Or, as he was<br>
 planning to buy the suit that very afternoon, instead of having both a<br>
 window and a suit he must be content witht the window and no suit.  If<br>
 we think of him as part of the community, the community has lost a new<br>
 suit that might otherwise have come into being, and is just that much<br>
 poorer.<br>
 <br>
 "The glazier's gain of business, in short, is merely the tailor's loss<br>
 of business.  No new "employment" has been added.  The people in the<br>
 crowd were thinking only of two parties to the transaction, the baker<br>
 and the glazier.  They had forgotten the potential third party involved,<br>
 the tailor.  The forgot him precisely because he will not now enter the<br>
 scene.  They will see the new window in the next day or two.  The will<br>
 never see the extra suit, precisely because it will never be made. <br>
 They see only what is immediately visible to the eye."<br>
 <br>
 This is from Henry Hazlitt's  "Economic in One Lesson".  The lesson? <br>
 "The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate<br>
 but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing<br>
 the consequences of that policy not merel for one group but for all<br>
 groups."<br>
 <br>
 See, the trouble with your position is this.  The money you use to do<br>
 your thing has been taken from people.  (In the best possible cases) the<br>
thing you've done seems to have had some visible benefit; but what is<br>
invisible is the other stuff people could have done with the money you<br>
took off them in taxes.  Think about it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Your thesis about self-actualizing safety nets is interesting and may</i><br>
<i>&gt;even be valid to some extent. What concerns me, however, are all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;people who lack the knowledge, skills and abilities to self-actualize</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves. The increase each year in the number of individual</i><br>
<i>&gt;bankruptcys speaks for itself. Don't we have an obligation to help each</i><br>
<i>&gt;other?</i><br>
<p>
We certainly do - a moral obligation.  And how, may I ask is that<br>
obligation discharged when<br>
money is extorted from us in taxes and used by *somebody else* to help<br>
others?  Since the money is not given voluntarily (just try to withold<br>
it!) we cannot be acting morally when we are handing over our well<br>
earned dosh, can we?  And this despite the fact that (again, in the best<br>
possible case) it is going to be used to help others.<br>
<p>
And there is the further consideration that very little of it will<br>
*actually* be used to help anybody. Most of it wil be used to pay the<br>
wages of people like you.  Well, it's no wonder you've got an interest<br>
in the continuation of statism, is it?<br>
<p>
But I tease.  Really, it does you credit that you are concerned enough<br>
about other people to go out and do something about it.  My beef is,<br>
because of the above-described scenario of "what is seen and what is not<br>
seen" (the original title of an essay by Frederic Bastiat, from whom<br>
Hazlitt took the story of the broken window), you are doing it in a way<br>
that destroys more than it creates - much as someone who should putty up<br>
the cracks in the windows of his house, while leaving the front door wide<br>
open.<br>
<p>
The unacknowledged *principle* behind the *manner* in which you are<br>
going about helping people is so corrupt, that you are in effect taking<br>
one step forward and two steps back.  <br>
