<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What's this mysterious 'E-Prime' problem that you and Hagbard keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; bringing up? </i><br>
<p>
E-Prime is English without the verb "to be" (is, are, was); more<br>
specifically, without the "is of identity" ("John is a liar; Linda is a<br>
lawyer; Edgar is stupid."). <br>
<p>
E-Prime emerges from the tradition of General Semantics. The reason for<br>
E-Prime is that the "is of identity" connotes an eternal Platonic<br>
essence possessed by the thing that is said to "be" something. The "is<br>
of identity" tends to blind both the speaker and the audience to many<br>
important characteristics about the relationship between the person<br>
being described and the quality or category being assigned to them. "Joe<br>
is a racist": "Racism" is not a measurable quantity of an object like<br>
mass or momentum; there is no "racism meter" we can point to a person<br>
that will detect whether Joe has the "essence" of a "racist" in him.<br>
"Racist" is a _name_ we give to an object based on our observations of<br>
emergent phenomena like behavior; but the assignment of the label is in<br>
our heads, not in physical reality. E-Prime, by restricting the use of<br>
the "is of identity," makes explicit the fact that these are statements<br>
about the state of our nervous system, not about the outside world.<br>
E-Prime confines itself to observations and operational statements like<br>
"Joe frequently makes statements that sound racist to me" or even "I<br>
heard Joe say Angelo is a dirty wop." <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Examples of English<br>
sentences translated into E-Prime: ENGLISH: Marty is an asshole.<br>
E-PRIME: Marty frequently says things that make me<br>
angry. ENGLISH: Religious fanatics like David Koresh are dangerous.<br>
(Makes the implicit assignment "David Koresh was a<br>
religious fanatic.") E-PRIME: The government considered David Koresh,<br>
whose followers believed he was God, a danger to<br>
their authority. (Talks about who holds what beliefs.) ENGLISH: Natalie<br>
Merchant's voice is the most beautiful in the world.<br>
E-PRIME: I like Natalie Merchant's voice better than anyone else's.<br>
ENGLISH: Natalie Merchant is a Commie dupe.<br>
E-PRIME: Natalie Merchant has said she thinks private property is bad.<br>
(An operational statement of an observable fact<br>
regarding something somebody has said.) [dV/dt] #<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; If it's something along the lines of, "Human perceptions are</i><br>
<i>&gt; limited, therefore our abstractions, definitions, and philosophies are</i><br>
<i>&gt; all based on incomplete and possibly false data and can't be trusted,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; then it's not the E-Prime problem, but a problem that Plato introduced</i><br>
<i>&gt; into philosophy a long time ago. It's the basis of skepticism, mysticism,</i><br>
<i>&gt; subjectivism, and a whole host of other crippling mental concepts.</i><br>
<p>
I see your point here. E-Prime does seem to flow out of a recognition<br>
that human perceptions are limited and therefore we are correspondingly<br>
unable to say something *is* anything with any any degree of accuracy.<br>
However, what I think is more accurate is that E-Prime flows out of the<br>
fuzzy logic camp moreso than any of classicist logicians. It recognizes<br>
that there is no eternal Platonic essence     <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is it wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt; or impossible for me to say, "Capitalism is a moral political system and</i><br>
<i>&gt; communism isn't." or "A philosophy which morally sanctions the initiation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of force is a bad philosophy and therefore inferior to those philosophies</i><br>
<i>&gt; which prohibit the initiation of force."?</i><br>
<p>
The point is that you've ascribed your own internalized feelings to both<br>
systems for eternity. (Maybe a bad thing, maybe not.) But this<br>
incorrectly assigns to each system an essence that seems intrinsic to<br>
the reader but is in reality merely a statement about your state of<br>
mind. Maybe this would be more clear, and less assailable: I like<br>
capitalism over communism because communism morally sanctions the<br>
initiation of force. This makes it clear that you are offering a<br>
subjective opinion, no matter how true you think it is, and you've made<br>
your point also with a reason for believing it. <br>
<p>
If I were to say, "Communism is a good philosophy and capitalism is a<br>
bad philosophy." Your first reaction might be, "That's nice. Go on."<br>
Expecting more from such a baldly opinionated statement such as that.<br>
E-Prime seems to avoid these formulary distractions and thereby tends to<br>
focus debate on substance.<br>
<p>
Yeah, but that's just semantics.<br>
<p>
Exactly. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It seems to me that you would</i><br>
<i>&gt; say that this type of ranking is either bad or impossible (judging by</i><br>
<i>&gt; your statement, "...to heirarchically rank human thought conjures the</i><br>
<i>&gt; very shades of ideology I seek to avoid in the first place.")</i><br>
<p>
But note how Kathryn worded it. It's clearly her own view, not<br>
axiomatic.<br>
