To Fellow extropians-<br>
<p>
I just finished reading a delightful book by Lee Smolin, a physicist and <br>
comsmologist at the University of Pennsylvania titled "The Life of the <br>
Cosmos".  It is a dramatic departure from cosmology as usual.  His basic <br>
thesis is that up until now cosmological/Grand Unified Theories have <br>
been searching for the "Fundamental Laws" that govern our universe.  He <br>
departs by saying that our extremely arbitrary and coincidental <br>
"constants" that seem to be just right for life (See the Anthropic <br>
Principle) are in fact a product of NATURAL SELECTION akin to <br>
evolutionary biology.  Most striking about his proposals is that he is <br>
talking pure science by providing methodologies for its disproof.<br>
<p>
That Chapters of the Book are:<br>
<p>
PART 1 - THE CRISIS OF FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS<br>
<p>
1. Light and Life<br>
2. The Logic of Atomism<br>
3. The Miracle of the Stars<br>
4. The Dream of Unification<br>
5. The Lessons of String Theory<br>
<p>
PART 2 - AN ECOLOGY OF SPACE AND TIME<br>
<p>
6. Are the Laws of Phyiscs Universal?<br>
7. Did the Universe Evolve?<br>
8. Detective Work<br>
9. The Ecology of the Galaxy<br>
10. Games and Galaxies<br>
<p>
PART 3 - THE ORGANIZATION OF THE COSMOS<br>
<p>
11. What is Life?<br>
12. The Cosmology of an Interesting Universe<br>
13. The Flower and the Dodecahedron<br>
14. Philosophy, Religion, and Cosmology<br>
15. Beyond the Anthropic Principle<br>
<p>
PART 4 - EINSTIENS LEGACY<br>
<p>
16. Space and Time in the New Cosmology<br>
17. The Road from Newton to Einstien<br>
18. The Meaning of Einstien's Theory of Relativity<br>
19. The Meaning of the Quantum<br>
<p>
PART 5 -<br>
<p>

<p>
Eiplogue/Evolutions<br>
<p>
