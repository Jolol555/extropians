<i>&gt; For the most part, Christians and other "main stream" religions are </i><br>

<i>&gt; with the moral implications of the technology that science makes possible. </i><br>
<i>&gt; But there seems to be a strong presents of others on the net that </i><br>
<i>&gt; categorize themselves as witches, pagans, and other similar religions that </i><br>
<i>&gt; attack not traditional theology issues but scientific thinking its self. </i><br>
<p>
Well, not all neopagans are anti-science, I have a friend who is a<br>
practicing pagan priest who is also quite transhumanist and happily<br>
discuss posthuman bodies and neural interfaces with me. But I think<br>
you are right in that anti-science memes flourish in the less<br>
mainstream groups, including non-mainstream christians. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What is of interest to me is they claim to be growing in numbers. I believe </i><br>
<i>&gt; their growth just may be true because the primary motivation for their </i><br>
<i>&gt; growth is a hatred of science its self</i><br>
<p>
I doubt that. You don't become a pagan because you hate science, you<br>
become a pagan because you like the neopagan message of "back to<br>
nature and natural religions" - which is of course quite compatible<br>
with anti-science, but doesn't have to. I think the main reason <br>
the non-mainstream religions are growing is that people more and more<br>
decide individually what they will believe in, and feel that the<br>
mainstream religions (and other mainstream institutions) are inflexible,<br>
behind the times and confining.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Many of the things that science </i><br>
<i>&gt; makes possible can be real scary to people who don't have the benefit of a </i><br>
<i>&gt; good education. This, combined with the fact that the cutting edge of </i><br>
<i>&gt; science in many fields is no longer intuitive and understandable to an </i><br>
<i>&gt; average person makes many people want to go to a simpler belief system that </i><br>
<i>&gt; is pre-enlightenment in nature.</i><br>
<p>
I agree with you on this. This is why we, since we are in general<br>
pro-science, have to share our knowledge and ideas with others. I personally<br>
plan to tour some schools this fall speaking about my research and<br>
science in general (I of course plan to insert a few &gt;H memes :-). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I get the sense that many of these people are spiritually scared to death </i><br>
<i>&gt; about the very subjects that this list talks about on a regular basis. </i><br>
<p>
Very true. Most of the "back-to-nature-anti-science-anti-transhuman-luddites"<br>
(gross oversimplification alert) are basically conservative about the<br>
human condition and don't *want* to change it, and don't *want* to<br>
have it changed. Essentially they are Stewards (to use Jaron Lanier's<br>
terminology), while we are Extropians. Different value-sets. I think<br>
many of us would be "spiritually scared to death" by their ideas of<br>
a static, eco-friendly world with little high technology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I also think that they are gaining in influence and isolating science from </i><br>
<i>&gt; everyday life replacing it with superstition. That is real bad. One day, </i><br>
<i>&gt; science just may find that it is locked in a castle with the peasants </i><br>
<i>&gt; outside the gate with their pitchforks and torches wanting to burn it for </i><br>
<i>&gt; its heresy.</i><br>
<p>
So let's fight it by making science more understandable and more present<br>
in everday life. We scientists are partially to blame because we have been<br>
living in our ivory towers too long, but now is the time to open the gates,<br>
invite people in and go out and show what we have found. The point is that<br>
increased contact is good - you cannot hate people you know, and <br>
science and sceptic thinking does rub off. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It seems the enlightenment is very fragile indeed and we should not take it </i><br>
<i>&gt; for granted.</i><br>
<p>
To keep a light burning it needs to be tended. <br>
