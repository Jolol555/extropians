<p>
&lt;&lt; or the stronger power would <br>
 obliterate the weaker, and then immediately rebuild itself, and then <br>
 expand spherically at a good fraction of the light speed. A Yes <br>
 answer to (2) would presuppose that a negotiated merger isn't made, <br>
 and that neither power can know with a great probability that it is <br>
 strongest, or that the stronger power has some absolute ethical <br>
 prohibition from attacking its weaker rival. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Interesting...but I've got some problems with the whole argument.<br>
<p>
Driving a truck crosscountry I regularly comeacross some of the so-called<br>
"Homeless"....in actuality they're no more homeless than I am...or rather it<br>
could be argued that I am, in fact homeless as well (live in an<br>
18-wheeler--live outa backpack...difference in degree)<br>
<p>
To stretch an analogy...I don't mug every (or even..any) homeless bum I<br>
encounter...he has nothing I want.<br>
<p>
Why would a nanotech society be interested in conquest and expansion?  All<br>
the traditional reasons for such are presently evaporating ...with<br>
increasingly functional nano-tech they will vanish like a snow-flake in a<br>
welding arc.<br>
<p>
If I had functional nanotech...and a siphon going into the ocean...or a tap<br>
into a gas line...or even a nice handy landfill or septic tank...(raw<br>
materials you know)..I can't conceive of any reason to exploit ANYONE...and<br>
since it effectively didn't cost me anything ....I'd be real likely to give<br>
away my discards...the stuff I've grown bored with...(like that articulated,<br>
all terrain, urban assault vehicle with the smart wheels..)<br>
<p>
Wouldn't cost me anything...<br>
<p>
Once again I think were having trouble "mapping" a society of abundance over<br>
our preconceived ideas generated from a society of scarcity.<br>
<p>
There HAVE been (relativly speaking...to their time and techno advancement)<br>
societies of abundance in the past..(rare...but there have been a<br>
few).precolumbian pacific northwest is one I beleive...and certain cultures<br>
in the Pacific Islands...<br>
<p>
They represent mature cultures...it might be instructive to review their<br>
methods of social interaction...when eveyone was "rich"<br>
