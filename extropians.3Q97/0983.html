In a message dated 97-07-23 14:11:20 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; With nanotech we<br>
 may have some of the capabilities of replicators within our lifetimes.<br>
 Don't you see how useful it is to start thinking about the implications<br>
 of such a revolutionary technology?  But pole shift?  Anybody with an<br>
 inkling of understanding of science should be able to see what a stupid<br>
 idea that is! &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Somebody posted about an allignment on 5/5/2000 and I posted something on how<br>
people believe that allignment will cause a pole shift.  Big deal!  Lighten<br>
up.  And what if it happens?  Arent you glad you were forwarned? (please dont<br>
post negative comments about that last line)  Some of you are too predictable<br>
and uptight  Awe, go ahead and post, I think anything should be allowed to<br>
post, as long as it's interesting, and water-powered cars, proper food<br>
combining, pole shifts, and especially psychedelics are very interesting.<br>
