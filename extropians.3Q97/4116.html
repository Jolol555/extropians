[I'm new to this mailing list, so please let me know if this question is<br>
not appropriate.]<br>
<p>
Consider an experiment in which a volunteer subject is told the following<br>
by the experimenter:<br>
<p>
"You will be given a sleeping pill. After you are asleep, I will flip a<br>
fair coin. If the the coin lands head up, I will make an exact duplicate<br>
of you, place you and your clone in seperate identical rooms, and wake<br>
both of you up. Neither of you will be able to tell whether you are an<br>
original or a clone. Then I will ask both of you the following questions<br>
<p>
1. What is the probability that you are a clone?<br>
<p>
2. What is the probability that the coin landed head up?<br>
<p>
If the coin lands tail up, I will place you into one of the rooms<br>
mentioned above without making a copy of you, wake you up, and ask you the<br>
same questions.  Also in both cases the the original (non-clone) is also<br>
asked a third question<br>
<p>
3. You are not a clone. What is the probability that the coin landed head<br>
up?"<br>
<p>
It seems to me that there are two possible sets of correct answers.<br>
<p>
A. 1) 1/4, 2) 1/2, 3) 1/3<br>
<p>
B. 1) 1/3, 2) 2/3, 3) 1/2<br>
<p>
I personally prefer answer set B. I have some justifications, but they are<br>
not terribly convincing. I can try to spell them out, but first I wonder<br>
if anyone else has thought about similar problems.<br>
