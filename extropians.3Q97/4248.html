<i>&gt;Hello all, I joined the extropy list as a response to Freespeak's</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
Welcome to the NSPIC debate.  Thanks for the intro.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I attended government run schools, but since I was more intelligent than</i><br>
<i>&gt;most and learned far more quickly than the curriculum progressed, I was</i><br>
<i>&gt;mostly bored.  I did a bit of daydreaming and for the most part endured</i><br>
<i>&gt;the boringness of it all.  But, since I could answer the vast majority</i><br>
<i>&gt;of questions correctly without paying attention, I never got sucked into</i><br>
<i>&gt;the brainwashing that goes on there.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Glad you learn quickly.<br>
<p>
I became a libertarian in 1973, and an anarcho-capitalist<br>
in 1975.<br>
<p>
After that, I started clearing NSPIC illusions from my brain in 1976.<br>
It took me about 10 years until 1986 to clear out all the NSPIC<br>
illusions I've found so far.<br>
<p>
After that, it took about 7 years until 1993 before I started<br>
communicating effectively about NSPIC to a few people.<br>
<p>
After that, it took another 4 years before I felt confident enough<br>
to launch a debate like this.<br>
<p>
And I still have a lot to learn...<br>
