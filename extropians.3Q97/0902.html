<p>
"Qualitative" and "quantitative" are differences in precision.  These terms<br>
are somewhat arbitrary and may be losing something here.<br>
<p>
I may have missed something, but I fail to see how psychedelics would<br>
improve the technology experience in any useful sense.  Technology must<br>
beget better, faster technology because my ability to think and create<br>
using technology far exceed the capabilities of current technology.  All<br>
psychedelics aside, humans have the natural ability to devise interesting<br>
and useful scenarios that exceed the bounds of current technology (read<br>
that as "imagination").  The rapid growth of technology means the eventual<br>
realization of everything I can conceive of creating.  This alone is reason<br>
enough for the forward progress of technology and is as qualitative as<br>
anything I can think of.<br>
<p>
My basic problem with the "psychedelic tribal etc. is qualitatively better"<br>
meme, is that it tends to limit real advancement by promoting the beauty of<br>
mysticism over the beauty of understanding ("ignorance is bliss" vs.<br>
"applied knowledge can lead to bliss with hard work").  Psychedelic-rich<br>
tribal communities solve few real problems.  Their subjective<br>
("qualitative") experiences lend little towards promoting the objective<br>
quality of their lives, other than as a form of escapism perhaps.<br>
