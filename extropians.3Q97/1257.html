<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; No, that is not the question. Not many would say that </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; consistency guarantees existence (apart from David Lewis). The </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; snowman is a logically consistent notion but that does not mean that </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the snowman exists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, obviously, if something is asserted to exist by a logically true </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; proposition, then it exists. So the questions are (1) Is the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; proposition that the Mandelbrot exists logically true? (which boils </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; down to whether the notion of "logical truth" in the traditional </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; way really makes sense), and (2) Is this kind of existence somehow </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; fundamentally different from the existence of objects which cannot be </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; claimed to exist by any logically true proposition.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Or as another example, with a definition of "reality" which classes the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Mandelbrot set and the Virgo cluster as the same, can we reject any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; logically consistent but "actually" non-existent phenomena as "real"?  Must</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; we say that alien spaceships "really" are visiting the earth today,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; simply because there is no logical contradiction in doing so?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The obvious answer to this rethorical question is No. The existence </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the Mandelbrot set is provable in standard (ZF) set theory, but I </i><br>
<i>&gt; don't know of any plausible axioms from which one can derive the </i><br>
<i>&gt; existence of visiting alian spaceships.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

An interesting way of thinking is that, even if the associated <br>
phenomenum does not exist in the reallity, there exists the <br>
associated neural conformation, like a mathematical transformation, <br>
when linear associated to a matrix, as we know. And this <br>
transformation is real and passible to be studied...<br>
<p>
Talking about real and not real, I'd like to include the <br>
mental images. If certain image comes in someone's mind could we <br>
classify it as real or virtual, like we do with mirrors and lens ? If <br>
a person creates (or simply projects...)  an image in its <br>
mind, there exists the associated brain (neurological) conformation, <br>
which is real (as said above). But,  are there mental  images that <br>
really correspond to real objects, even if they are not near? If <br>
there are, could we consider them as real time, time delayed or even <br>
antecipated?     Why that? Because, in positive case, on <br>
artificializing a human (not necessarily...) brain, we can, in the <br>
future, possibly, create televiewers not necessarily just <br>
present-time, but to the past and possibly the to future (as an <br>
extrapolator of the present real conditions). If it is possible, <br>
could we use such machine to scan the individual's barin conformation <br>
in the past and reinstall it in a new artificial body <br>
(preferenceably miniaturized), in the future?<br>
What do you think about this?<br>
