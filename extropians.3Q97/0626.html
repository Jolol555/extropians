     Recently there have been some subjects that have popped up of <br>
     questionable, genuine scientific value (Roswell, pole shifting, and <br>
     maybe psychedelic-driven evolution).  It's intriguing to see the <br>
     rather intense reactions from the more academic members who wish not <br>
     to have the sanctity of their digest polluted with unproven or highly <br>
     improbable subjects.<br>
     <br>
     What's fascinating is the *effect* these discussions have.  One <br>
     reader, upon visiting the pole shift web sites declared "Aw shit!" (as <br>
     if he was already committed to his cryonics agreement but fat lot of <br>
     good it was gonna do him now because a world calamity is due by <br>
     century's end),  While the mental tug of war about the physics versus <br>
     the circumstancial evidence plays out, some go into flame mode at <br>
     having to be subjected to drivel, others wax mildly concerned about <br>
     the possibility of such a thing occurring.<br>
     <br>
     There is pre-millenial fever brewing in us all but isn't the current <br>
     time frame our own invention?  2000 means something because somewhere <br>
     way back when, we decided it did.  Does 2000 mean anything to the <br>
     Orthodox Jew or the Chinese?  Or maybe it's because 2000 is the mark <br>
     of a dominant world culture that makes it more special.<br>
     <br>
     Sure, it'd be nice for something a little novel to occur.  I was in <br>
     tears watching Contact just because it connected with the childhood <br>
     pain I felt of not belonging on this pretty fucked-up planet, <br>
     beautiful and pristine as it can be at times.<br>
     <br>
     Hypothetically, if the evidence started pouring in, the pole shift is <br>
     a definite, I wonder what actions the devoted Extropian might pursue <br>
     in increasing the assurance that s/he won't be crushed, drowned, <br>
     incinerated etc.. Entertain this notion if you will, suppose you have <br>
     a little less than 3 years before it's "the end of the world as we <br>
     know it".  What's your plan of action?<br>
     <br>
     Hypothetically, all the scientific lack of substantiation aside, what <br>
     if aliens crashed in New Mexico 50 years ago and the government knows <br>
     about it.  How does that alter your perception?<br>
     <br>
     If psychedelics open up a conduit in your chemical makeup to receive <br>
     information from another dimension (yes, I'm introducing this concept <br>
     that has heretofore not been mentioned), what of that?  <br>
     <br>
     So much thrashing about on the details, the facts, the proof or lack <br>
     thereof.  You may ask, do I *believe* in Roswell?  When I was younger <br>
     I liked the idea.  The details are so pureed though, who could tell <br>
     and who has TIME to dig that deep when ultimately you have to make a <br>
     decision on faith (or as one reader said about pole shifting "belief <br>
     bias").<br>
     <br>
     It's a security-based phenomenon to focus one's attention on empirical <br>
     proof so one doesn't have to deal with the emotions of what to make of <br>
     the unknowns.  You can keep it all left-brained and quite tidy.  If <br>
     that doesn't work, you can make some intelligible static as you look <br>
     down your nose at the quaint naive ones who have dashed the other way <br>
     like Chicken Little running around in hysteria that the sky is going <br>
     to fall (or the pole is going to shift &lt;G&gt;).  <br>
     <br>
     These tabloid-worthy stories are myths but I don't regard them as such <br>
     to dismiss them.  Myths are valuable.  Their archetypal impact brings <br>
     out a wide range of emotion and it's quite interesting to observe that <br>
     in others and in ourselves.  <br>
     <br>
     I'm certainly not advocating that the scientifically-minded spend <br>
     overt amounts of time mollycoddling the more impulsive members of this <br>
     digest.  I am suggesting that when someone brings up something that <br>
     occurs for you like a matador's cape to a bull, you might want to <br>
     drill down into what's triggering the response of judging, controlling <br>
     and flaming.  <br>
     <br>
     Personally, I like the fact that this digest covers the map from the <br>
     viability of food replicators to ancient evidence of Atlantis BEING <br>
     Antarctica (that's where that thread could possibly go..).  It's <br>
     entertainment and as memes go, it's a nice distraction, sometimes a <br>
     thought-provoking one.  And of course, it doesn't take much reading <br>
     between the lines to see that my red flag is control-meisters who want <br>
     to get the Animaniacs out of the studio lot (sorry, I have to plug <br>
     those guys at least once).<br>
     <br>
     Lightly,<br>
     Rick<br>
