<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    I will start by saying that I agree completely that a “true”</i><br>
<i>&gt; free-market economy would be ideal.  One that is competitive, open, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; decentralized.  But is a market free, if a company becomes so powerful</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it establishes a near-monopoly on a given market and in turn</i><br>
<i>&gt; prevents competition and progress form occurring?  A good example now I</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe is Microsoft.  If your answer is no, then what methods or “laws”</i><br>
<i>&gt; would enable the market to remain free and competitive without large</i><br>
<i>&gt; corporations controlling policy?  As an anarcho-libertarian I want to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; free of any coercion, government or corporate.  How do we as extropians</i><br>
<i>&gt; propose to enhance the potential of a “true” free-market taking hold?</i><br>
<p>
Rather than looking at Microsoft's continuing status, try looking at<br>
what they have really had to do to keep that status. The error of people<br>
who point the finger at monopolies is that their excuse would only work<br>
in a market with no technological progress, as all it would take to beat<br>
out the monopoly is to build a better mousetrap. Microsoft succeeds<br>
because its people are not satisfied to be number one for a day, they<br>
want to stay nuber one, and, despite claims to the contrary by<br>
reminiscers of that quaint old Apple, they must constantly improve their<br>
products to compete with the other companies that build better products<br>
than Microsoft's previous versions. Even in no-tech industries, like<br>
farming, monopolies are hard to come by because of the commodity value<br>
of the product.<br>
<p>
Do you wonder why the anti-trust lawsuits against Microsoft have faded<br>
away, its because the cheif whiner, the President of Novell, lost out,<br>
and the number two whiner, Ellison of Oracle, has decided he could do<br>
better by trying to do a technological end run around Microsoft with his<br>
NC technology. Aldus got bought by Adobe, so they chilled out.<br>
<p>
All that antitrust stuff in the news was just the competition trying to<br>
put some brakes on Microsoft, who had taken advantage of some strategic<br>
mistakes the others had made.<br>
<p>
I think that the high level of Microsoft haters out there indicates that<br>
Microsoft won't dominate the applications industry, and the evidence<br>
from Corel so far indicates that this will remain this way as the<br>
competition seems fully capable fo turning out quality, even superior<br>
applications.<br>
<p>
As for the OS market, so what? SOmebody has to set the standard. Ghu<br>
knows that Apple abrogated that right when they continually charged a<br>
stiff premium for an OS that did not get improved very often. The fact<br>
that Microsoft was able to come along and kick their butts indicates<br>
that the monopoly domination claim is bogus.<br>
