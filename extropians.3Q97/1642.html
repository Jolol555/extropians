First an apology...I'm having trouble (again) with software.. and I'm not<br>
online....consequently I won't be able to cite sources....this has happend a<br>
lot and I'm afraid it will continue...hazard of the profession I guess.<br>
<p>
In an earlier post a prediction of being able to make micro-robots in the<br>
near future was referenced.  I had some fun with that relative to the "Bug<br>
Wars" concept.  But there are other ideas which occur to me.<br>
<p>
Surgery for example.<br>
<p>
Now my understanding of neurosurgery is limited at best...(I missed that day<br>
in Truck Driving School)...but from what I understand the nerve impluse is<br>
electro-chemical.  That is it travels by ionic transfer thru the<br>
nerve(dendrite) and then by chemical transfer from axion to (?) ...across the<br>
gap.   This obviously is speed limited.  Several tens to several hundreds of<br>
feet per second.  Pitiful.<br>
<p>
In an earlier reference it was mentioned that the ability had been aquired to<br>
fuse a chip to a nerve.  A direct nueral interface on a single nerve level.<br>
 Or perhaps I read it somewhere else....but I'm quiet sure that I DID read<br>
it.<br>
<p>
At anyrate.  Imagine this:  Using a micro-robot "surgeon" attach a fiber (as<br>
in "fiber optic") to a nerve near the top of the spinal column....then<br>
parallel that nerve along the spinal cord (thru the arms, legs...whatever)<br>
until it reaches it's destination...then tie in again.  In effect cutting out<br>
several feet (possibly) of slow electro-chemical nerve impulse transference<br>
and replaceing it with light-speed.  Does this suggest anything about<br>
increasing reflex time?  Or more prosaicly,,,repairing spinal cord injury?<br>
<p>
But why stop there.  Many of my favorite  SF stories and novels use the<br>
device of a direct neural interface (David Weber-"Imperial Implants", Daniel<br>
Keys Moran-"Inskin", ...to name but two) to directly control mechanisms or<br>
communications.  Is this not possible now?  At least in theory?<br>
<p>
It might be kinda of tacky to have a socket in the base of your skull, or<br>
wrist or ankel....but the rewards might justify such a lapse in fashion.<br>
