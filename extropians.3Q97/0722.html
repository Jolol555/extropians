Several years ago Baen Books published a series off books called (I beleive)<br>
"New Frontiers".  They were published semi-regularly for a while...almost<br>
monthly I beleive, and contained fact and SF.<br>
<p>
One of the fact articles was an essay by Jerry Pournelle which I remember as<br>
"The Pournelle Political Axis"<br>
<p>
Briefly this states that the traditional  Right/Left dichotomy is inaccurate<br>
and that there is in fact a second dimension to politics. These axes<br>
are:Rational vs. Mystical and Good Government vs Bad Government.<br>
<p>
Take Rational vs. Mystical as the vertical Axis and Place Rational at the Top<br>
and Mystical at the Bottom with a zero in the middle and tens on each end.<br>
(10,0,-10). <br>
<p>
Rational being defined in the form: Questions are inherently answerable and<br>
problems are inherently solveable. (scientific method)<br>
Mystical being defined in the form: There are some things that man is not<br>
ment to know. (relegion)<br>
<p>
At right angles to this the horizontal axis with  Loves Government on the<br>
Right , zero in the middle and Hates Government on the left (-10,0,10)<br>
<p>
Loves Government being defined in the form: The more the<br>
better,...centralization....socialization....in control<br>
Hates Government being defined in the form: would rather kiss a rattlesnake<br>
on the lips than haves<br>
<p>
This forms four quadrants : the upper right being Rational and Loves<br>
Government (communism as an example)<br>
                                      : the upper left being  Rational and<br>
Hates Government (Libertarianism as an Example)<br>
                                      : The Lower Right being  :Mystical and<br>
Loves Government (The Christian Coalition ,Nazis)<br>
                                      : The Lower Lefti being : Mystical and<br>
Hates Government   (some really weird folks...can't<br>
                            think of an example...relegious anarchy of some<br>
sort.)<br>
<p>
The degree of how strongly a position was held is quantified( 0 to 10 ).  I<br>
would venture to guess that most of the US is floating around zero but with a<br>
tendency toward being right of verticle and below the horizontal.  I would<br>
venture to guess that Extropians are off the scale in the upper left quadrant<br>
(-10,+10)...out past Libertarians and some Anarchists.<br>
<p>
But I haven't heard anything more about it in years...outside of the<br>
Libertarians "World's Shortest Political Quiz" which is in the same format.<br>
<p>
Is this useful...or merely interesting.  Accurate? It got Jerry Pournelle a<br>
Ph.d. if I recall.<br>
