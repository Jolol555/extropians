And yet the standard definition of "consistency" is in terms of <br>

Suspect you find the notion of model-relative truth unproblematic as <br>
opposed to the notion of truth, simpiciter.<br>

How does the Tarski definition of truth involve the idea of <br>
consitency? (For those who don't know, the basic idea behind Tarski's <br>
celebrated definition of truth is that:<br>
<p>
	The sentence "Snow is white." is true if and only if snow is white. <br>
	Etc.<br>
<p>
Ingenious! Before: A sentence including the word "truth". After: a <br>
sentence not including the word "truth"(or true)  but with exactly <br>
the same meaning as the former sentence. Result: a successful <br>
contextual definition of the word "truth" has been given.)<br>
