<i>&gt; If everybody can (and does) own guns, policing becomes dangerous as hell,</i><br>
<i>&gt; cops want bigger guns and more of them, and they will use them more often.</i><br>
<p>
"Police only have an easy job in a police state" - someone or other.<br>
<p>
As for 'bigger guns and more of them', how come cops in many European<br>
countries carry submachineguns, yet most US cops only carry pistols? Does<br>
this mean that those European countries have more guns than the US? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In Holland NOBODY get's to own a gun unless there are special circumstances.</i><br>
<i>&gt; our murder-rate is about 15 (fifteen!!) times as low as the US (per capita).</i><br>
<p>
The majority of murders in the US occur in a few large cities. Outside<br>
those cities there are many towns or entire states where the murder rate<br>
is no higher than normal for Europe. Those are also the states with the<br>
most relaxed gun laws; at the other end of the scale, Washington DC is<br>
normally the most dangerous US city, yet it has the toughest anti-gun laws<br>
in the country. Isn't that odd?<br>
<p>
Back in the 'bad old days' of the Wild West when just about anyone could <br>
walk into a gun shop and buy a gun with no questions asked, the US murder <br>
rate was comparable to that in England today (about 1 per 100,000). Why has <br>
the US murder rate gone up as more and more gun control laws have been <br>
passed? Can you say 'prohibition'?<br>
<p>
Holland has very liberal drug laws. The US has the infamous 'War on<br>
Drugs'. Most murders in the US are literally casualties in that 'War'; and<br>
note that in the last two weeks in England three people were shot dead in<br>
the street in battles between drug-smuggling gangs and two more shot in<br>
battles between beer-smuggling gangs (in fact five more people were shot<br>
today, though noone knows the motive yet). How could that be with Britain's<br>
incredibly tough anti-gun laws? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, there could also be other reasons for this but IM(very)HO the private</i><br>
<i>&gt; ownership of (hundreds?)of millions of handguns, shotguns and such has</i><br>
<i>&gt; something to do with it.</i><br>
<p>
Oddly, criminologists disagree with your simplistic viewpoint. But here<br>
are a few obvious examples:<br>
<p>
In Switzerland most men are required to keep a fully-automatic assault<br>
rifle at home as part of their militia duties. Yet Swiss murder rates are<br>
far lower than the US average. <br>
<p>
In Israel people wander around the streets or even drink in bars with an<br>
M-16 or Uzi slung over their shoulder or a holstered pistol on their belt<br>
(which would be a heinous crime in most of the US). Yet the murder rate in<br>
Israel is lower than the US average. <br>
<p>
Here are two countries where the people don't just possess wimpy handguns <br>
and shotguns but fully-automatic military weapons. Yet they just don't <br>
shoot each other. Why?<br>
<p>
In Jamaica and Mexico, gun ownership has been banned for years, yet the <br>
murder rate is several times as high as the US. How come?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I onze read somewhere that between 1965 and 1975</i><br>
<i>&gt; more than 500.000 US citizens where shot in the US (10 for every American</i><br>
<i>&gt; killed in 'nam).</i><br>
<p>
That figure is definitely high for deaths, unless it includes suicides and <br>
killings in self-defence (even then it seems high). Even so, so what? You'd<br>
prefer they had their brains bashed out of their skull with a blunt<br>
object?<br>
<p>
And before you come back with some nonsense about how people wouldn't<br>
commit suicide without guns, note that the US suicide rate is rather lower<br>
than in Holland. And if Holland is such a paradise, why do Dutch people<br>
kill themselves so often? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For their sake, please consider a society without (to much) guns and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; governement that you at least trust a little bit.</i><br>
<p>
A government which doesn't trust me to own a gun is not a government<br>
which deserves my trust. <br>
<p>
And as a left-winger you might like to research the real reasons behind<br>
past gun control laws; they weren't instigated in Britain because they<br>
were expected to have any effect on crime, but as a means of keeping guns<br>
out of the hands of socialists and communists, and thirty years ago the<br>
American left would have been bemoaning the Californian gun-control laws<br>
passed to disarm the Black Panthers. How soon we forget. <br>
