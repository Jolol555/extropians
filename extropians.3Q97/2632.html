I am currently reading a biography of Benjamin Franklin, Esmond Wright's<br>
"Franklin of Philadelphia" 1986 Harvard U. Press, as part of my on-going<br>
study of the 18th century Enlightenment as a rich lesson-plan for extropians<br>
and the transhumanist movement.  Naturally, Wright recounts Franklin's<br>
scientific and engineering work with electricity as a pivotal part of<br>
Franklin's life story.  Every American elementary school student absorbs the<br>
image of Franklin as a dabbler with kites and thunderstorms, but may not<br>
learn that in fact Franklin was really a person who "found electricity a<br>
curiosity and left it a science," in Carl Van Doren's phrase.  His 1751<br>
pamphlet, "Experiments and Observations on Electricity at Philadelphia in<br>
America", was the most systematic account of electrical phenomena to date and<br>
electrified (ahem) the European intellectual establishment with its<br>
systematic debunking of the then-current (ahem) "two-fluid" theory of<br>
electricity.  Among Franklin's contributions to what we would call physics<br>
was the experimentally confirmed development of a theory of positive and<br>
negative charge and also of a systematic vocabulary of the phenomenon.  He<br>
can be credited with either coining or regularizing the use of the terms<br>
armature, battery, brush, charge, condense, electrify, Leyden bottle, and<br>
nonconductive.<br>
<p>
Ever the practical man, Franklin was definitely the developer of the<br>
lightning rod as an architectural element, and he worked vigorously for the<br>
use of lightning rods to protect buildings and shipping.  Lightning being a<br>
traditional symbol of divine retribution, the increasing use of the lightning<br>
rod during the middle years of the 18th century became a, well, lightning rod<br>
of contention and a symbolic rallying point for those who we can today<br>
rightly see as the precursors of modern humanistic and scientific<br>
materialism.  As Wright puts it, lightning rods became a "test of<br>
enlightenment among men."  Traditional religious thinkers condemned the<br>
lightning rod as a "presumption against God", an "intervention in God's<br>
purpose".  Thus, debates about such things are not new to our time, and the<br>
ultimate power of humanistic utility a goal not only of our own age.<br>
<p>
An interesting historical aside and irony can be found in the lightning rod<br>
debate.  Apparently quite a few communities still dominated by religious<br>
superstition actually outlawed the use of lightning rods.  Saint Omer in<br>
France was one of these.  When M. De Vissery de Boise-Vale sought to protect<br>
his home with a lightning rod in the 1780s, his neighbors tore it down,<br>
supported by a local ordinance.  A celebrated court case followed in which M.<br>
De Vissery de Boise-Vale was supported by the more progressive members of the<br>
French scientific community.  And who were the lawyers in the case?  For the<br>
prosecution, none other than Jean-Paul Marat; and for the defense, none other<br>
than Maximilien Robespierre.  Of course, in these two figures we can later<br>
see the bloody dangers of radicalism in any cause: In Marat the tyranny of<br>
the Romantic reaction to the Enlightenment, and in Robespierre the dangerous<br>
knife-edge of an overconfidence borne of an uncritical belief in one's own<br>
rationalism.<br>
