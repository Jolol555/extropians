The Pygmy Fund, PO Box 277, Malibu CA 90265,<br>
www.blackworld.com/orgs/pygmy1.htm<br>
is an entirely private charity that has saved the Efe<br>
Pygmies in Africa from extinction.<br>
<p>
Just a few tens of thousands of dollars would help them<br>
survive in the chaos of Zaire.<br>
<p>
International aid is going to save the national parks<br>
in Zaire where some animals live.<br>
The park guards are using the money to kill the Pygmies<br>
because they are trespassing on the national park land.<br>
They are in the park because they were pushed off their<br>
land by the refugees and the fighting.<br>
<p>
So some of the UN money may end up killing human beings<br>
rather than helping a private effort to save them.<br>
