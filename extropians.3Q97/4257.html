Here is another paradox.  Wei wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1. If the subject's answer to question 3 is a3, then he should be willing</i><br>
<i>&gt; to accept the following bet after giving his answer: if the coin landed</i><br>
<i>&gt; up, he loses 1/a3 dollars, else he wins 1/(1-a3) dollars. But if a3&lt;1/2,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the experimenter has a positive expected profit from running the</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiment.</i><br>
<p>
(For reference, question 3 is "given that you are not a clone, did the<br>
coin land heads".)<br>
<p>
Consider question 2, "did the coin land heads".  Suppose the subject's<br>
answer to that is a2.  He should be willing to accept the bet: if the coin<br>
landed heads down, he loses 1/a2 dollars, else he wins 1/(1-a2) dollars.<br>
But if a2&gt;1/2, the experimenter again has a positive expected profit.<br>
<p>
The reasoning which leads to answer (B) gives a2 = 2/3.  So in this case,<br>
too, the experimenter can make a profit off the hapless clonee.<br>
<p>
Apparently whichever line of reasoning the subject uses, the experimenter<br>
can take advantage of him.  The only way to avoid it is for the subject<br>
to answer both questions 2 and 3 as 1/2.<br>
