In a message dated 97-08-30 03:36:24 EDT, you write:<br>

&lt;&lt; <br>
 Let's see... he kept his job, lots of people discussed his theory, and the<br>
 government gave him several million dollars to put an instrument up on a<br>
 satellite to decide matters one way or another.  The worst thing that<br>
 happened was that almost everyone told him he was wrong.  Now, if he turns<br>
 out to be right, he becomes very famous and respected.  It seems to me that<br>
 this is science working exactly the way it ought to.  How would you have had<br>
 people act differently?  <br>

&lt;munch...munch...you know ...crow aint half bad...needs a little salt though&gt;<br>
<p>
I guess your right...maybe I've been reading too much Science Fiction....<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;slap!&gt;&gt; I've told you before...you can't EVER read too much Science<br>
Fiction!!&lt;Slap!..Slap!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
where the intrepid Scientist discovers something new and marvelous to the<br>
acclaim of all.  "Frank" as you call him...(I would never so presume)..wrote<br>
 something to the  effect of "being treated as a paraih" ,having "become a<br>
Science Machine"  and how events had "taken all the fun out of science".<br>
<p>
Seems a bit much to endure ...of course ole what's his name got to drink<br>
Hemlock....so maybe it's getting better.<br>
