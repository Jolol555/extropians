: I'll just give you the left-wing, Dutch pinko view on this stuff and if<br>
: you want to flame me to crisp ... that is your right as a free entity.<br>
<p>
Do you think we haven't heard it before?<br>
<p>
: Maybe it would be worthwhile to try to break the armrace between a number<br>
: of citizens and American law-enforcement agencies.<br>
<p>
It wasn't an arms-race until the government made it one.  Compare:<br>
<p>
On one side, we have the Weaver family who were well armed but minding<br>
their own business.  Nobody has credibly claimed that they were a <br>
threat to the government or anyone else.  Certainly they never attacked <br>
any official.  On the other side, we have federal agents who blackmailed<br>
Randy Weaver, and when they came to arrest him, *killed his dog* before<br>
anyone knew they were there.  (When Weaver's son shot back he was killed,<br>
and never knew who killed him.)  Who's the threat?<br>
<p>
Then there's Don Scott, a millionaire who lived near Malibu.  Government <br>
agencies paid someone to say he saw marijuana growing on Scott's land so <br>
they could seize it.  They broke down his door at midnight, without <br>
warning.  Scott got out of bed with a gun (a little revolver, I believe) <br>
but without his eyeglasses -- not a smart move, but when you're awakened <br>
by a battering-ram, it's easy to make mistakes.  They killed him.  <br>
(No dope was found.)  Who's the threat?<br>
<p>
: If everybody can (and does) own guns, policing becomes dangerous as hell,<br>
: cops want bigger guns and more of them, and they will use them more often.<br>
<p>
Well then, let's get rid of the cops.  After all, they kill in error <br>
far more often than non-cops do.<br>
<p>
In the real world, a number of states recently made it easier for <br>
ordinary people to carry guns, and violent crime *declined*.  (Not<br>
including some of the most populous states, so overall U.S. numbers <br>
are still rising.)<br>
<p>
: In Holland NOBODY get's to own a gun unless there are special circumstances.<br>
: our murder-rate is about 15 (fifteen!!) times as low as the US (per capita).<br>
<p>
Only 15 times?  If guns were the problem, the factor ought to be<br>
a lot more than 15, because the rate of gun ownership differs by<br>
more than that.<br>
<p>
You also have a less fanatical War On Minority Drugs.<br>
U.S. murder rates declined steadily from the repeal of (alcohol) <br>
Prohibition (1933) until the Sixties; since then, they have risen steeply.<br>
<p>
That decline was *not* interrupted by the return of millions of soldiers<br>
with their trophy guns.  The subsequent increase was *not* interrupted<br>
by the Gun Control Act of 1968, or any other gun control legislation.<br>
<p>
: Now, there could also be other reasons for this but IM(very)HO the<br>
: private ownership of (hundreds?)of millions of handguns, shotguns<br>
: and such has something to do with it. I onze read somewhere that<br>
: between 1965 and 1975 more than 500.000 US citizens where shot in<br>
: the US (10 for every American killed in 'nam).<br>
<p>
And even more than that were killed by medical negligence.<br>
Shall we outlaw the practice of medicine?  <br>
(Hillary is working on it, but that's another thread)<br>
<p>
How many of those half-million were shot by police?<br>
How many were shot by citizens in self-defense?<br>
<p>
How many crimes were *prevented* because a citizen demonstrated<br>
the ability to defend himself?  Nobody counts those, but they're<br>
estimated at more than a million each year.<br>
<p>
: For their sake, please consider a society without (to much) guns<br>
: and a governement that you at least trust a little bit.<br>
: Seems to work out more or less here ...<br>
<p>
Tell it to the German Jews.  They had no guns <br>
and they trusted their government a little bit.<br>
<p>
Are you seriously suggesting that our government would *begin* to <br>
behave decently if we turn in our guns?<br>
<p>
(Maybe you can trust your government because it's so much nearer.  <br>
Each member of your Parliament's lower house represents about 10^5 <br>
people, and lives in the next county; each member of our House of <br>
so-called Representatives represents six times as many, and lives <br>
across the continent.  On another hand, the cops who raided my friends <br>
worked for the City.)<br>
<p>
: If the US governement is as F*%$#-up as you seem to believe (I woulnd't<br>
: know, being on this side of the atlantic), why not get a new one? Last<br>
: time I heard the US was a democracy.<br>
<p>
All the branches of the government are united in their desire to<br>
concentrate as much power as possible in their own hands and protect<br>
themselves from any real reform.  For example, the Supreme Court <br>
recently approved arbitrary restrictions on who may run for office, <br>
to protect voters from being "confused" by more than two choices.<br>
