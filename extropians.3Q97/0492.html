<p>
As far as I'm concerned, a priori knowledge is stuff hardcoded into<br>
our brains by the genes, and it originates in the gene-pool's<br>
"perception" of the environment over millions of years. The perception<br>
of the environment by a species gene-pool is a very slow, long-term,<br>
and wasteful thing, proceeding on purely Darwinian means. But I<br>
prefer not to believe in knowledge that has no causal origin, and<br>
that's the only causal origin I can appeal to to account for what<br>
philosophers have traditionally referred to as "a priori" knowledge.<br>
Trying to make sense of Kant's abstractions in terms of evolutionary<br>
epistemology is a bit of a struggle, since there's a whole bunch<br>
of jargon from genetic algorithms that describes this stuff<br>
beautifully and doesn't map well to Kant at all. (And furthermore,<br>
my grasp of Kant is dim at best and mostly secondhand.)<br>
<p>
Regarding the direct intuitive perception of truth, as with the<br>
perception of the truth of a mathematical theorem after spending<br>
many hours playing with the axioms and lemmas that underlie its<br>
proof, this is still rather mysterious stuff in neuroscientific<br>
terms. Most fruitful work in neuroscience-oriented epistemology<br>
focuses on the origin of empirical knowledge, just as much of Popper<br>
and Lakatos and Bartley's work in critical epistemology focuses on<br>
the origin of mathematical and theoretical knowledge... knowledge<br>
that has "logical structure" that we don't always find in empirical<br>
knowledge. Trying to come up with a model of PCR that works in an<br>
entirely neuroscientific paradigm is a toughie. And I can't quite<br>
get away from the fact that phrases used by the mathematicians to<br>
describe the certainty of mathematical knowledge seems to map nicely<br>
to the vocabulary used by Buddhists and other mystics to describe<br>
the certainties arising in their holistic religious experiences.<br>
Whatever is going on here is going on in some synesthetic area of<br>
the brain that welds together information coming from a variety of<br>
different sensory inputs and postprocessing areas: the mysterious<br>
and ever fruitful "intuition".<br>
<p>
Anyway, if you buy into the evolutionary-epistemology metaphor<br>
about a gene-pool being able to "perceive" its environment at a<br>
completely different timescale from that in which we say that an<br>
animal organism can perceive its environment, then I wouldn't<br>
hesitate to identify that "Darwinian perception" as the origin of<br>
the so-called "a priori" knowledge... but the perception of the<br>
gene-pool is not the perception of an individual organism, who is<br>
born with the potential for the development and unfolding of this<br>
"a priori" knowledge but to the pure empiricist is still tabula<br>
rasa as far as a posteriori knowledge is concerned. And clearly<br>
the two interact:  a priori "knowledge" serves as a structure within<br>
which a posteriori knowledge can be constructed, but might be a<br>
mere scaffolding that is not much use without being empirically<br>
informed, and actively developed by that other mysterious process<br>
we call "thinking things through".<br>
