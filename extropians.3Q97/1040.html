     There are larger implications.  By filling the list with stupid ideas,<br>
     we will attract the kind of people who like such things.  It's a fact<br>
     of life on the net: quality attracts quality, and the opposite is true<br>
     as well.  Ultimately the goal of comments like Perry's is to encourage<br>
     the kinds of discussions that will attract and keep the many fine <br>
     thinkers the list has had.<br>

     Not good enough argument to compel me.  There've been voluminous <br>
     threads written about F111 planes (stemmed of Roswell thread I <br>
     believe) and the correlation between our mechanics problems and that <br>
     of an interstellar craft.  Geez!  Talk about a stretch of the <br>
     imagination!  Oh but wait, there's some technical relevance there.  <br>
     <br>
     I think the controlling mentality is not justified...not yet.  There <br>
     is plenty of quality material on this and as Forrest Gump would say <br>
     "Stupid is as stupid does." If unworthy posters are attracted to this <br>
     mail list, it is unlikely just by coincidence.  Either they WANT to <br>
     learn and be educated or the appeal of extropian values/thinking <br>
     extends to the less-scientific, more sensational science <br>
     fiction-oriented mind.  Me thinks a little o' both.<br>
     <br>
     The best defense is a good offense: filter your mail.  This digest is <br>
     cumbersome for me and I haven't the time to thoroughly read most of <br>
     it, particularly when ideas drift off into semantical offshoots that <br>
     essentially begin other topics. But I deal.  <br>
     <br>
     While I feel Perry M. has a right to be annoyed about whatever he <br>
     wants in regards to this list, allowing for questionable posts that <br>
     don't explicitly offend or harrass does seem to be one of the costs of <br>
     a forum where free expression of ideas are encouraged, even wacky <br>
     ones.  <br>
     <br>
     I think there are ways of curtailing the zanier notions without <br>
     resorting to elitist and overtly-critical tactics.  It is my feeling <br>
     that quite often, a person with a gripe about one thing has a spur <br>
     somewhere else.  E-mail lists are impersonal enough without resorting <br>
     to such imperious grandstanding.  I would think that it would be a <br>
     near "prime directive" of an Extropian to not let the petty social <br>
     foils of our culture interfere with the exchange of information, even <br>
     if they don't agree with it.<br>
     <br>
     By virtue of the discussion this thread has caused, people like Danny <br>
     could well be credited as an impetus for enabling us to look at what <br>
     triggers are desire to control, curtail and otherwise thwart <br>
     cooperative effort.  I for one am not clutching my pearls in panic <br>
     that the poles are going to shift in less than 3 years.  But if it <br>
     came out tomorrow that it was, I think it would be utterly fascinating <br>
     from a scientific as well as sociological standpoint!<br>
     <br>
     For a brief moment when pouring through that thread, I asked myself <br>
     "what would you do if you only had 3 years left?" It was a great <br>
     self-exploration for me.  To that end, scientific "garbage" or not, it <br>
     provided value!  I look at the subjective "I" as well the objective <br>
     "it" (as Ken Wilber would say).<br>
