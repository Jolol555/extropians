I haven't seen this. Is it good hard SF?<br>

Please, it is called "South Pole Accelerator". The reason I name my <br>
inventions/concepts is to assist in my claim to them- the same reason<br>
parents name their children.<br>

The SPA corridor indeed has a plasma core, but the purpose is to create a <br>
partially evacuated flight path for projectiles launched from the <br>
surface. The plasma is somewhat sheathed by neutral gas. I didn't look in detail <br>
at its electronic efffects on the ionosphere, maybe someone should.<br>
There is somethng of a "hole" in the ionosphere at the pole, south of <br>
the Auroral Light (where electrons and ions entrained in Earth's magnetic<br>
field hit the upper atmosphere) affording a reduced particle density.<br>
I think there would be a quasi-static stabilization of Earth-to-space <br>
current after the corridor is established, probably near zero amps. If this<br>
doesn't occur naturally, it might be assisted by electrically isolating the<br>
launch facility, charging the projectiles, etc.<br>
You might also want to check out the HAARP website, I think that instrument is <br>
capable of constructing a plasma corridor, possible reaching to the surface, or<br>
to a tower.<br>
