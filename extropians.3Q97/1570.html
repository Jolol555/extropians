Well, there’s Jared Diamond’s _Guns, Germs, and Steel_ which has been<br>
mentioned here several times.  There’s a nice bite-size version of<br>
this (along with fairly recent comments from many people such as Greg<br>
Benford and Kevin Kelly) in Diamond’s paper "Why Did Human History<br>
Unfold Differently On Different Continents For The Last 13,000 Years?"<br>
