     ...it looks like Sandberg was right; the "Singularity" CAN lead to <br>
     passivity. Insofar as there IS going to be a Singularity, cultish or <br>
     not, does anyone have suggestions on how the concept could be <br>
     presented so as to avoid a repeat of the above error?<br>

     I was pondering this as well.  In recent posts and in your essay on <br>
     the subject, I found a well of apathy building inside of me.  Why?  <br>
     Certainly not because it wasn't going to be such a profound and <br>
     strangely curious and inticing event but because I was *implicitly* <br>
     forbidden to dream about/imagine it.  In doing so, one was easily <br>
     dismissed because their dreams were so small, their imaginations so <br>
     limited.  Well, you got to paint the sign with pretty colors if you <br>
     want people to come into the store.<br>
     <br>
     An interesting article in this month's Discover magazine about <br>
     "scientific beauty" compels me to ask what part "beauty" and our <br>
     fundamental instinct of attraction towards the symmetrical combination <br>
     of power and elegance play in our advance towards the transhuman era.  <br>
     If the Singularity is even remotely painted as something <br>
     incomprehensible, you might as well be trying to sign people up on <br>
     Columbus' ships because as far as they're concerned, they're going to <br>
     fall off the edge of the world.<br>
     <br>
     At least some of my energy can be devoted towards what I dream a new <br>
     world to be.  If I must stay myopically focused on what to do to get <br>
     me to "who knows where", my interest curiously wanes.<br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>
     <br>
