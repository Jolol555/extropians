Max More has written in the past about two intellectual epiphanies in<br>
his life: one when he discovered libertarian writings, another when he<br>
encountered the pancritical rationalism of Popper and Bartley.  I have<br>
been having one of my own in the past few weeks, stimulated by the<br>
writings on cities of Jane Jacobs.<br>
<p>
In _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_ (1961) she attacks<br>
conventional urban planning of the time, citing as evidence of great<br>
intellectual bankruptcy first the origin of urban planning assumptions<br>
in writings by people who hated cities and wished to do away with them,<br>
and second the failure of urban planning implementations to solve or<br>
even prevent from worsening the problems they purported to solve.  Slums<br>
were removed and replaced by large housing projects, which spiraled into<br>
decay even faster; attempts to solve traffic congestion by accomodating<br>
more cars simply led to more congested cars; zoning which separated out<br>
commerical and residential uses to improve the quality of life in<br>
residential areas led to decay and crime in those areas; a belief that<br>
high population densities were synonomous with slums and overcrowding<br>
was belied by the collapse of tracts of low-income houses while many<br>
well-off people (the "people with choice', as she reiterates over and<br>
over) choose to live in crowded and dynamic neighborhoods such as<br>
Greenwich Village or much of San Francisco; etc.  <br>
<p>
The strength of cities is in diversity of uses, as closely intertwined<br>
as possible, which attract and draw along the streets strangers who<br>
visit the various shops and keep, by virtue of numbers, the streets and<br>
parks safe.  And cities are instances of organized complexity<br>
("spontaneous order", in the Extropian lexicon) which cannot be<br>
understood by simple mechanical models or statistical models, but by<br>
detailed examination and knowledge akin to the process of understanding<br>
how a biological organism works.<br>
<p>
Now I've begun _Cities and the Wealth of Nations_ (1982), wherein she<br>
boldly challenges every macro-economisc theory I've heard of.  Here her<br>
damning evidence is the existence of stagflation (high inflation and<br>
unemployment, common in the 1970s), the possibility of which was denied<br>
by each and every theory, whether demand-side, supply-side, monetarist,<br>
Keynesian, Marxist, etc.  First she notes that high prices *relative to<br>
local wages* coupled with high unemployment is the normal state of most<br>
historical economies.  Prices in India look low to us, but high to the<br>
locals.  (I'm forced to note, however, that stagflation should involve<br>
high and rising prices; stagnation would simply include high prices.<br>
She may have claimed that stagflation was simply the natural route to<br>
full stagnation, though; I don't remember precisely, I'm afraid.)<br>
Scotland in Adam Smith's time had locally high prices and high<br>
unemployment relative to England, even as Britain did relative to Europe<br>
in the 1970s.<br>
<p>
Having claimed every existing theory was falsified by severe<br>
disagreement with reality, she identifies the theoretical flaw as the<br>
assumption, inherited without question from mercantilism, that nations<br>
are a viable level for examining economic activity.  As she points out,<br>
the idea that comparing Singapore, Indonesia, Italy, and the United<br>
States at the same level should appear inherently ridiculous,<br>
particularly as California alone is nearly as large as Italy, itself<br>
divided into two quite differently healthy economies, and the United<br>
States has long been composed of many diverse areas -- industrial North,<br>
stagnantly rural South, dynamically rural West, etc. -- which have<br>
changed over time.<br>
<p>
Instead she posits the city as the basic unit of economic expansion,<br>
especially through the route of import-replacement, namely the<br>
development of local industries to make what had formerly been imported<br>
from other cities.  I haven't read any further in the book yet, but it's<br>
been very exciting so far.  I hope I've conveyed a bit of that.<br>
<p>
On an unrelated note, I looked at Eric's Loglan book while I was in<br>
Berkeley and the language does look neat.  Caltech libraries don't have<br>
anything on it, though.<br>

At that point, it didn't matter to Jame if this was a god, a<br>
hallucination, or the local form of street sanitation; she was out of<br>
the alley the way she had come before the creature had turned the far<br>
corner.<br>
