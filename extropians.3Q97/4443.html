<i>        &gt;Most people I met in the Internet say I have an excellent English. </i><br>
           <br>
<p>
You do, and your English is certainly one hell of a lot better than my <br>
Portuguese!<br>
           <br>
<i>        &gt;Free-markets is not (at least for many people) the best solution </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's easy to dream up something better, the trouble is they're comparing the <br>
free market as it actually is, warts and all, to a mythical command economy <br>
lead by a person who has the following 3 properties:<br>
<p>
1) He always knows the right thing to do.<br>
2) He always has the moral courage to actually do it.<br>
3) He always has the leadership skills to get people to do what he wants.<br>
<p>
Property 3 is fairly common, a little too common for my taste, moral courage <br>
is very rare and property 1 is nonexistent. Even if you make the very <br>
optimistic assumption that the IQ of a typical politician is larger that his <br>
shoe size, the idea that even a great genius could figure out from first <br>
principles the price an object should be in order to maximize its production <br>
is crazy. But the  market will tell you very clearly what the price should be, <br>
no trouble at all.<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;if someone disagrees with free-markets he is not necessarily wrong. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
True, not necessarily, just very probably. I've never heard of an economic <br>
system that could actually be implemented that worked better than the market <br>
and I doubt that one exists, but I've been wrong before. If somebody comes up <br>
with something better I'd be surprised and absolutely delighted, it would <br>
have beaten the market fair and square in, you guessed it, the free market of <br>
ideas. <br>
          <br>
