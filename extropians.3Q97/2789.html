<i> &gt; In particular, the doctrine of comparative advantage doesn't seem</i><br>

<i> &gt; those resources and gain greater control over them.</i><br>
<p>
Mind control of one individual by another hasn't yet been perfected,<br>
and there is no guarantee that nanotech is the only missing piece<br>
of this particular puzzle.  Conquerors lose access to the resources<br>
represented by the *minds* of the competition; in the old days,<br>
minds were not as attractive as lands, but in modern information-economy<br>
circumstances, I think the economic tradeoffs stack up a little<br>
differently, and the theory of comparative advantage is quite<br>
relevant.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; However in the context of a nanotech takeover, the balance would</i><br>
<i> &gt; be different.  Nanotech slavery can be perfectly effective.  In</i><br>
<i> &gt; fact, it would be more useful to think of the conquered resources</i><br>
<i> &gt; as now being an extension of the will of the conquerer, rather than</i><br>
<i> &gt; slaves.  In fact the destruction may have involved gray-goo meltdown</i><br>
<i> &gt; or nuclear fire, in which case the intelligences in the conquered</i><br>
<i> &gt; region are built from scratch.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think we know yet whether or not nanotech slavery can be<br>
perfectly effective.  And I don't think we know yet whether or not<br>
intelligences can be built from scratch.  It seems entirely possible<br>
to me (I don't know how likely) that all future intelligences are<br>
going to be heavily modified diachronic successors of uploaded<br>
human beings (or uploaded and uplifted animals).  I'm not saying<br>
the ab initio hard-AI crowd can't succeed, I'm just pointing out<br>
that they haven't put all their cards down on the table yet.<br>
It might turn out to be a dud hand.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; The only real objection I can see to this is that the takeover</i><br>
<i> &gt; process will involve some destruction.  This could mean the permanent</i><br>
<i> &gt; loss of useful information, and it could also delay the time when</i><br>
<i> &gt; the new resources can be fully exploited.  The alternative of</i><br>
<i> &gt; mutually beneficial trade could allow faster conversion to nanotech</i><br>
<i> &gt; (since there is no time wasted in warfare) and would retain more</i><br>
<i> &gt; information.</i><br>
<p>
This is a significant objection, since Bostrom phrased his point<br>
4 as a cost-benefit balance.  Especially in the circumstances in<br>
which we find ourselves, in which the only present significant<br>
threat to our species is inadvertent self-suicide.  Mutually<br>
beneficial trade might speed up the advent of the Diaspora,<br>
which I personally care about a great deal more than the<br>
Singularity.  War might prevent the Diaspora from ever<br>
happening.  So the cost-benefit analyses look pretty<br>
straightforward to me, and they don't favor war.<br>
