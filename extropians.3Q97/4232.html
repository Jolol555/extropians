You are correct, but it is this correlation that has imbued into the<br>
unwashed the concept of negative feedback as being "bad", "wrong",<br>
"painful" etc. even though negative feedback is much more useful for the<br>
stability of any system one may imagine, be it the human system, a<br>
lawnmower, or the economy. Because early economists did not sufficiently<br>
understand this, the early concepts they espoused as being "good" for<br>
the economy, stimulating growth and prosperity, typically resulted in<br>
synthesizing a cyclic behavior based originally natural disasters<br>
affecting crop yeilds that was quickly amplified out of all control,<br>
resulting in great "Booms" and "Busts". Cyclic amplification is the<br>
natural result of positive feedback, while cyclic dampening is the<br>
result of negative feedback. Quoting Robert Heinlein: "Do I know what<br>
caused the 1929 crash and the Depression? No, but have you ever seen an<br>
engine running solely on positive feedback? It tears itself apart."<br>
<p>
This is the one downside of laissez faire economics, it restricts<br>
negative feedback and stimulates positive feedback, especially in<br>
economic systems that are secretive and where information is guarded<br>
jealously. The  downside of government is that its only good at being<br>
negative feedback. Anytime it tries to do positive feedback, it is<br>
usually more harmful than a free economy left alone.<br>
<p>
You'll notice in todays economy in the US, the only numbers that are<br>
still kept relatively secret are the numbers that the Fed bases its<br>
decisions on. If they didn't keep them secret, then the negative<br>
feedback policies they decide on would not be as effective. Just about<br>
everything else is open. All publicly traded corporations have to<br>
disclose their performance, and polling organizations and economic<br>
analysts are contantly crunching huge amounts of data trying to<br>
prognisticate what the fed will do. They seem to be right about half the<br>
time...<br>
