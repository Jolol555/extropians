<i>&gt;Does anyone have the date for the first sex/gender change or male or female?  </i><br>
<p>
This may be a tricky question, as you don't have to have surgery to <br>
render a sex change.  Use of hormones will also drastically alter <br>
biological sex organs, and often surgery is not needed.  In some <br>
cases, surgery makes the change more permanent.  <br>
<p>
In modern times, several disorders related to gender have been <br>
identified, each having a course of treatment that would fall under <br>
the category of a sex change:  Klinefelter's syndrom (extra X <br>
chromosome), Turner's syndrome (missing X chromosome), Speck syndrome <br>
(extra Y chromosome), hermaphrodotism (dual sex organs), and gender <br>
dysphoria (feeling of being in the wrong body).  All are treated with <br>
hormones, and in the case of the latter two, surgery.  <br>
<p>
Babies that are born with sexually indeterminate organs are often <br>
subjected to surgery at birth to render them as one or the other sex. <br>
It is estimated that about 12,000 operations of this type take place <br>
per year, and Congress recently had hearings in which persons who had <br>
been subjected to this type of surgery voiced their opinion that the <br>
doctors should have been required to wait until the age of consent to <br>
conduct this surgery.  Evidently this type of surgery has been <br>
conducted for years prior to the adult voluntary sex change surgery, <br>
but I don't know the year that began.<br>
