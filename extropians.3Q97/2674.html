<i>&gt; Some people say (correctly I think) that we can know almost nothing about </i><br>
<i>&gt; what things will be like after the singularity, BUT then they tacitly assume </i><br>
<i>&gt; that the rate of change after The Spike will level out into a plateau of </i><br>
<i>&gt; sorts, a very high plateau to be sure but a plateau nevertheless. I see no </i><br>
<i>&gt; reason why that should be true and think we should expect an accelerating </i><br>
<i>&gt; rate of change for the indefinite future.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The black goo might look pretty </i><br>
<i>&gt; scary in the first few milliseconds after it was made, but after a geological </i><br>
<i>&gt; age (a minute or two) it would seem more pitiful than scary, like a man armed </i><br>
<i>&gt; with a flint ax trying to concur the world.</i><br>
<p>
I think you are vastly overestimateing the acceleration. A speed-up <br>
of the order you talk about would require new hardware, and that <br>
hardware needs to be assembled, which is a physical process which <br>
cannot be made arbirarily fast. This means that a minute or two <br>
would not ba a "geological time", even if we assume that the arrival <br>
of superinelligence had completely cut away design and debug delays.<br>
<p>
But suppose that you were right about this. Then the first power to <br>
get to the "singularity" (I sometimes wonder whether that term <br>
doesn't do more harm than good) would only need to be a *few seconds* <br>
ahead of the competition to become the ruler of the universe (at <br>
least in absence of aliens). I reality, of course, the leader would <br>
be months ahead, so this would automatically enable the leading power <br>
to eliminate all competition.<br>
