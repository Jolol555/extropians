As much as I agree with its goals, I wish the libertarian<br>
propaganda machine would show a little more scientific integrity<br>
here rather than trotting out these old figures constantly.<br>
<p>
Some of these are estimates, some are actual counts, the counts<br>
are from different years, nothing is adjusted correctly.  In<br>
particular, it is completely disingenuous to say "there is no<br>
single proven death by marijuana" and then use the 50,000 figure<br>
for second-hand smoke: there is no single proven death by second-<br>
hand smoke either.  That 50,000 number is a government estimate<br>
based on one study with dubious methods.<br>
<p>
If you're going to include estimates like that, you have to<br>
include estimates that marijuana smokers /do/ die from lung<br>
diseases now and then.  Most of them smoke tobacco as well,<br>
and lung cancer happens in non-smokers now and then, so while<br>
we can't /name/ anyone who sepcifically died from smoking<br>
Marijuana, it's likely to be a few hundred a year (given the<br>
relative proportion of marijuana to tobacco smokers).<br>
