<i>&gt;managers. I know, all the studies say otherwise, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt;economic forces that drove the growth of management hierarchies</i><br>
<i>&gt;were the increases in productivity of the organizations that</i><br>
<i>&gt;employed them: those organizations became more proifitable than</i><br>
<i>&gt;their competitors and won in the marketplace, because the tasks</i><br>
<i>&gt;the managers were doing increased the productivity of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;companies. Now many of those tasks can be done more efficiently</i><br>
<i>&gt;because the computers help. Therefore, companies need fewer</i><br>
<i>&gt;managers to provide the same level of management.</i><br>
<p>
To give a concrete example of the superiority of hierarchies,<br>
organizational theorists say that hierarchies are able to switch directions<br>
faster than flat organizations.  Because the communication flow is<br>
determined, and everyone knows who they are supposed to listen to, a CEO<br>
can make a decision and be fairly confident that it will be heard and<br>
implemented down the company structure.  Without PC's on networks, and the<br>
means of tracking their costs and opportunities, small teams wouldn't have<br>
a hope of gathering the information they needed to make the right decisions<br>
about what they should do next.  And then the cost of coordinating that<br>
decision with all the teams they are dependant on would be astronomical.<br>
But with the new technology, and a fast market-like mechanism for signaling<br>
requirements, you can devolve the information-gathering task to local teams<br>
and get the flexibility of small groups without the lumbering behavior of<br>
uncoordinated bureaucracy.<br>
