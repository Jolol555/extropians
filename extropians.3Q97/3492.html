<i>&gt; More, the ideal rate at which you decrease the temperature surely varies</i><br>

<i>&gt; observed.</i><br>
<p>
True. However, the damage can likely be reduced significantly by<br>
using clever cryoprotectants compared to plain freezing. Also, there<br>
is a problem with too slow cooling, according to Mike Darwin (I know<br>
I'm quoting him all the time in this debate) we would want around<br>
1 degree celsius/minute, instead of one degree per hour. Tricky.<br>

<i>&gt; Speaking about how long it will take for us to control aging, never</i><br>
<i>&gt; forget that even when we correct all the errors in our genome that</i><br>
<i>&gt; create aging now, we will have to worry about the errors that will cause</i><br>
<i>&gt; us diseases when we are 200, 300 or 1000 years old! </i><br>
<p>
I don't think genetic errors is a likely problem once the "basic" ones<br>
are fixed. The genome is finite, and if we can fix one part of it so<br>
well we can stop aging it seems likely we can deal with the secondary<br>
aging problems. However, there are likely many other reasons beside<br>
genes to why we age; we need some radical restorations after a few<br>
centuries anyway of the non-replenishing systems, plain damage and<br>
waste built-up, not to mention to expand our capacity to avoid getting<br>
trapped in a loop. <br>
