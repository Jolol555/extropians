Absolutely! We are in utter agreement!<br>

PS: And none of them will be bureaucrats, of course...<br>
Pleas don't take this as kvetching--I'm quite prepared to bet money. :)<br>

Dear Michael and other fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
Actually, :-) some of them will in fact be frustrated and disgusted<br>
politically appointed bureaucrats who have gotten into a rut and are<br>
simply mad at the world. <br>
Others are simply those who are in the private sector and feel that they<br>
might be discommoded by change. Frequently, the general run-of-the-mill<br>
kvetching is simply an outlet or sublimation of other anxieties or<br>
agressions that have nothing really to do with with whatever they're<br>
kvetching about. <br>
<p>
Such is human nature.<br>
<p>
Enjoy!!!<br>
