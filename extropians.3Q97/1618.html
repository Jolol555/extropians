Sounds good. I'm pretty sure that any interesting long-term<br>
historical development has multiple causes. I like this theory,<br>
and I still like the alphabetic theory (which I should no doubt<br>
be crediting to whomever thought it up first) too.<br>

You're right about early modern European pluralism. I was confused<br>
in the back of my head by Hayek's arguments in THE CONSTITUTION OF<br>
LIBERTY to the effect that the notion of "rule of law" (as<br>
distinguished from rule of men) was first articulated among the<br>
Greeks and was transmitted in their literature (and that of the<br>
Romans, notably Cicero) to modern European political philosophers.<br>
But rule of law is a different thing from political pluralism,<br>
though perhaps the historical correlation between the two is not<br>
entirely coincidental.<br>
