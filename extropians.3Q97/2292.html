Actually, I really believe that we should just try to keep things<br>
on a relatively even keel for the next 9 years or so. Most<br>
attempts at fixing the system have up-front costs to the<br>
ecology (an economy) that will not be recovered for 20 years<br>
or so. However, our ability to fix this mess will get very<br>
rapidly better. IMO, we'll hit the singularity. Therefore, it<br>
actually makes sense to defer any attempt at massive improvement<br>
in our use (abuse?) of the environment: we're likely to do<br>
more harm than good, sort of like the attempts during the<br>
last century to preserve ancient works of art. If the<br>
preservationists had simply left the stuff alone, we'd<br>
now be able to do a much better job. I realize that it sounds<br>
as if I'm just waiting for the Tooth Fairy to come and<br>
solve all our problems, but I'm not.<br>
