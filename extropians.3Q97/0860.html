I believe the claim Carl was referring to is that employers who<br>
routinely used such scores or organizational memberships to qualify<br>
or disqualify job applicants could be sued and fined for illegal<br>
discrimination in employment. I have no idea whether this is the<br>
case, but this claim seems much more plausible to me than the<br>
one you were thinking of.<br>
