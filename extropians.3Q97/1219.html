<p>
<i>        &gt;Then it depends on what you mean by "fundamental", right?</i><br>
        <br>
<p>
Right. I'm interested in how my views on this subject will evolve, you're <br>
free to believe what you want.<br>
<p>
<p>

<i>        &gt;Virgo cluster interacts with matter and energy, the Mandelbrot set         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;does not.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
All true, but will there come a day when these facts will have no more <br>
fundamental physical significance TO ME than the fact that the USA has 50 <br>
States or the solar system has 9 planets or the stooges have three members?<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The Mandelbrot set has thickness zero, the Virgo cluster has a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;nonzero thickness.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's sort of interesting. The Mandelbrot set doesn't have a thickness <br>
exactly, but just like any 3 dimensional object, the surface of the set is <br>
2 dimensional. In 1991 Mitsuhiro Shishikura proved that the boundary line of  <br>
the Mandelbrot Set is as convoluted and wiggly as it is possible for a line <br>
drawn on a flat surface to be, that means it has a fractal or Hausdorff  <br>
dimension of 2.<br>

Actually you were quoting me.<br>

<i>        &gt;What about the old distinction in logical positivism between         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;propositions true (solely) in virtue of their meaning and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;propositions whose truth also depend on how the world is? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
But that's the question, if something is logically consistent does that make <br>
it part of the world?  I'm not a big fan of Logical positivism either, <br>
Russell's theory of types is really ugly. Also, the idea that a every <br>
question must have a clear and precise answer or it's totally meaningless <br>
seems impossibly restrictive to me. After Godel we know that even the best<br>
logical systems will be inconsistent or incomplete or both, and English is <br>
far from the best, and yet with all its imperfections people have still <br>
managed to get quite a bit of mileage out of it.<br>

I've read Quine but don't usually call myself a Quinean.<br>
