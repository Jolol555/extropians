<p>
I'm a pretty strong advocate of children's rights, of making it<br>
easier for people younger than 18 years old (or whatever the local<br>
taboos set the age of majority at) to present a legal case for<br>
their own emancipation than current law in most countries currently<br>
seems to allow.<br>
<p>
I've known a lot of people who have, at some time in their childhoods,<br>
been in foster care, including my grandmother and most of her<br>
siblings.  The reports I hear of state-supervised foster care are<br>
universally infuriating, yet "runaway" kids are routinely treated<br>
as juvenile delinquents regardless of whether or not any other<br>
"criminal" behavior is presented, and returned to foster care<br>
against their will.  This may be a worse problem in the USA than<br>
elsewhere... I don't know much about conditions elsewhere.<br>
<p>
I liked all the stuff Carl Feynman had to say about encouraging<br>
his daughter to ask why, the sorts of answer-question-chains that<br>
develop, and the sorts of answers that bring up the ends of<br>
those chains. That's in the list archives.<br>
<p>
My own upbringing was much more permissive than the "community<br>
standards" of the Midwestern US cities I grew up in, but I seem to<br>
have turned out all right, and I noticed the other kids envying me<br>
my parents much more than I was envying the other kids their parents.<br>
My mom was a Grateful Dead fan, and followed some elements of the<br>
"deadhead" lifestyle throughout much of my childhood, and I regret<br>
none of that (although my older sister didn't like it very much).<br>
I got to meet a lot of interesting conversationalists when I was<br>
young, older people who took the time to point me toward interesting<br>
books I might enjoy reading, like Peter Pan and the Chronicles of<br>
Narnia and Dune and The Stars My Destination and Childhood's End<br>
and Brave New World, all of which I was fortunate enough to read<br>
as a prepubescent. I can think of a lot of librarians who would<br>
not have allowed me to lay hands on Brave New World at that<br>
age, and I actually found it very frightening, a bit sickening,<br>
at that age, but I don't think it harmed me too much.<br>
<p>
This uncensored reading thing is a tradition in my family. My aunt,<br>
as a high school student, wanted to get a copy of de Sade's JUSTINE<br>
from the school library, and the librarian wouldn't let her have<br>
it. This was in the late 1950s. According to family legend, my<br>
grandfather stormed in there and demanded, as a paying customer<br>
(it was a private boarding school, not like the public schools I<br>
attended), that the book be delivered into his daughter's hands.<br>
The book was delivered.<br>
<p>
The one thing I do regret about my upbringing is that my<br>
parents didn't teach me much about the value of money. I signed<br>
a contract saddling me with some heavy student loans when I was<br>
18, and when I signed that contract, basically, I had no idea<br>
what I was doing. It took me ten years to extricate myself from<br>
that situation, and in the course of my self-extrication I<br>
learned quite a bit about the value of a dollar. It might have<br>
been easier for me if I'd been funding more of my own<br>
adolescent expenses out of a fixed allowance... then again,<br>
perhaps it might not have.<br>
<p>
As Anders has pointed out, the most important skill is learning<br>
how to learn, teaching oneself how to teach oneself. It seems<br>
to me that many kids (not all, unfortunately) have a huge<br>
natural endowment of curiosity that only needs to be encouraged<br>
and allowed relatively free reign to start a self-sustaining<br>
fire of continuous self-education. But the very schools that<br>
seem most helpful to the kids who (for whatever reasons) lack<br>
this strong drive of research curiosity seems to stunt it in<br>
the kids who are forced to go to those schools even though they<br>
probably have no need for them.<br>
<p>
Given the condition of state-run schools in the United States,<br>
I cheer everytime I hear of a friend who is homeschooling their<br>
kids. I am filled with respect for these people... it's not an<br>
easy proposition to have to pay all your taxes *and* school<br>
your kids at home.<br>
<p>
I've also never understood why people get so scandalized about the<br>
notion of paying kids to teach themselves stuff. In terms of social<br>
structure, going to school is a kid's job. I didn't bother learning<br>
the multiplication table the way it used to be conventionally taught<br>
until a couple of years ago, and I learned and forgot long division<br>
three separate times during my schooling, the last time when I had<br>
a younger student teach it to me when I was seventeen years old.<br>
Since then I've gotten through calculus and a bit of linear algebra<br>
without much trouble, but my elementary and junior high-school<br>
mathematics education was a shambles from which I was lucky to<br>
recover.  Might things have gone easier for me if my parents had<br>
just offered me a large (from a kid's perspective) cash bonus for<br>
mastering the boring old multiplication table (it really is useful...<br>
I'm very glad I finally bit the bullet and memorized the thing),<br>
and later cash bonuses for passing evaluations of other<br>
reading/writing/arithmetic type skills? I'm not sure.  Plenty of<br>
room for debate and experiment here.<br>
<p>
Since I've gone over some personal history here, it might be<br>
useful for the historians in the crowd to know that I was in<br>
elementary and junior high school in the 1970s and in senior<br>
high school and college in the early 1980s.<br>
<p>
Honesty is probably more important than anything else.<br>
<p>
I could go on and on about this, and I've probably already<br>
offended more than one extropian parent with my smartmouth<br>
know-nothing opinions, but there you have some of them.<br>
