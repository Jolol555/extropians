Robin,<br>
<p>
Perhaps to create is not *necessarily* to torture, but it can be. <br>
<p>
I have heard teenagers say, miserably:<br>
<p>
  "I didn't ask to be born. And now that I am born, I am going to die!"<br>
<p>
Some (though none that I have met) take ultimate control of their lives<br>
from fate by killing themselves before fate gets a chance. I recently took<br>
the decision whether or not to participate in the creation of a new person,<br>
and decided that, on balance (only just!), I am glad that I was born. I<br>
doubt that most give it a thought before they procreate.<br>
<p>
Yet one man's torture is famously another man's pleasure, and there are<br>
both prisoners in jail and politicians in the grave to prove it. So until<br>
we figure out the right and wrong of the future, perhaps the past can offer<br>
some advice: do to others what you would have done to yourself.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
Darren<br>
