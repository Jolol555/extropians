Rudy Rucker (in _Infinity and the Mind_):<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would respond that omega is a _given_, an object of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; immediate pre-rational experience. And to use the tools of symbolic</i><br>
<i>&gt; logic to investigate an _empirically_ existing phenomenon...</i><br>
<p>
Roderick A. Carder-Russell:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It seems to me that he is at first asserting that the concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt; omega exists a priori. He then goes on to speak of it further as</i><br>
<i>&gt; an empirical phenomenon, certainly in clear contradiction of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; first statement. Any thoughts on this? Could I be correct, or am</i><br>
<i>&gt; I missing something in the text?</i><br>
<p>
I suspect he's saying that we can directly perceive omega,<br>
as directly as we can perceive sounds or colors - although<br>
not through any of the five senses, but through some other<br>
faculty of mind (e.g. "intellect" or "intuition"); and that<br>
he will count as empirical evidence, not only sense-data,<br>
but also "intuition-data", derived from that extra faculty.<br>
<p>
Eric Watt Forste:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is the kind of thing that Kant invented the phrase</i><br>
<i>&gt; "synthetic a priori" to cover. It looks like Rucker is asserting</i><br>
<i>&gt; that omega belongs to the synthetic a priori, although he may</i><br>
<i>&gt; not *intend* to have done so...</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure about this. A priori knowledge is supposed to<br>
be had without appeal to perception. Rucker might agree that<br>
the existence of omega is not an analytic truth, but he<br>
might say that we only know about omega because we "perceive"<br>
it (again, where "perceive" would have to include the alleged<br>
faculty by which one is directly aware of mathematical<br>
entities).<br>
