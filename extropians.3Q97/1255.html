<i>&gt;... I would say that it runs contrary to the interests of</i><br>
<i>&gt;social institutions to reveal the mechanics of their own</i><br>
<i>&gt;constructions to the individuals that are affected by them.</i><br>
<p>
Steve Witham responds:<br>
<i>&gt;Yes, but why?  "Want" is just a shorthand.  The question is, *why*, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;your opinion, it's in the interests of "social institutions" ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;to conceal rather than reveal their own constructions?   Why</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't they benefit by being up-front and above-board instead?  </i><br>
<p>
Kathryn responded:<br>
<i>&gt;I already explained this, in a paragraph that I worried might offend </i><br>
<i>&gt;Robin, as it explained Basics.  </i><br>
<p>
Steve responded the way I would have.  The closest I've heard to an<br>
answer is by Dale Carrico:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Social institutions, vocabularies, scripts often best maintain</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves by relying on a fantasy of their necessity, inevitability,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or self-evidence ... I'm the last to</i><br>
<i>&gt;deny that robust and attractive social institutions might could should</i><br>
<i>&gt;and often have maintained themselves in other modes -- the openness</i><br>
<i>&gt;you describe, for example -- but this simply doesn't apply to Western</i><br>
<i>&gt;constructions like race, sex, gender, sexuality, beastliness, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;rest of that pesky constellation as they have come down to us here and</i><br>
<i>&gt;now.  </i><br>
<p>
O.K.  This seems to be a direct application of a general rule that<br>
something that wants to get chosen gains an advantage by having the<br>
choosers be less aware of other choices.  So the extent to which any<br>
random institution, say journal editorship, is threatend by revealing<br>
the construction of gender depends on the extent to which some<br>
alternative to that institution would be more visible with revealed<br>
construction.  I find it hard to believe that most social institutions<br>
would be very threatened, since I don't think their alternatives<br>
typically depend much on gender, but I'm open to being convinced.<br>
