Glad you didn't. <br>
Thanx Rick, again (for clarity) I posted that story underneath, and<br>
seperatly from the main post, not to make a specific point but just because<br>
I consider it very enlighting. I did not refer to any listmembers whatsoever.<br>
<p>
Having susrvived many thing that I shouldn't have statistically, I am<br>
generally very optimistic about what can be done about al kind of problems<br>
(let's call them challenges, much better ;-).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;     Peace</i><br>
<p>
The world is always in short-supply of that. I do not Expect that we will<br>
settle all our differences anywhere soon, that's OK. Diversity is good. It<br>
prevents you from becoming lazy about your beliefs. Could we maybe, sort-of<br>
turn all the political threads into problem-solving-oriented discussions?<br>
(don't get me wrong I'm just as guilty as anyone in 'defending my belief')<br>
Point some of our combined brain-power to currently feasable solutions for<br>
some of the worlds worst economic &amp; social problems.<br>
We have more resouces (mental, informational) than 99,5% of the global<br>
population, anyone interested in putting some of it to work for their benefit?<br>
<p>
I was thinking about things like cheap medicine produced in the milk of<br>
genetically-engineered cows/sheep. Making the first cow is of course very<br>
complex and expensive. But once you have a working model they reproduce<br>
themselves (well almost ;-). This is the kind of technology that can be<br>
implemented *today* (we have a prototype bull here in Holland) and be put<br>
to work at very low cost in third-world countries, requiring only a simple<br>
infrastucture and little knowledge from the endusers.<br>
Millions of lives could be saved at only minimal cost to all of us (the<br>
reseach would pay for itself problably, we need medicine too).<br>
<p>
Ideas on stuff like this anyone?<br>
<p>
<p>
