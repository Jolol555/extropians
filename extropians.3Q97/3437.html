  Having for now stayed out of the Extro-Nazi's/Extro-Saint's thread,<br>
I can no longer hold my tongue.  Since when did Extropianism become so<br>
downright puritanical?  Holly's post, although lacking a few salient<br>
points, drew out all sorts of self-righteous puritanical types.  I had<br>
no idea how much value and *virtue* people on this list have put on<br>
*hard* work.  It would seem that many of you were raised in a<br>
Protestant strong 'work ethic' household.  I would have thought, being<br>
extropians you would have the wisdom to see the value and<br>
*limitations* of hard work have.  Lighten up. Have Fun!<br>
<p>
   I stand behind Holly, when I say that hard work sucks!  I can think<br>
of alot of better things to do than working all the time.  Yes, I work<br>
hard to, but only to get wealthy enough so I don't have to work like a<br>
dog anymore.  I would much rather spend my time transforming my self,<br>
creating art and having fun.  If that is not your goal, I suggest you<br>
re-examine your beliefs and reconsider even calling yourself an<br>
'extropian'.  Extropianism is about combatting *all* limits to our<br>
happiness and freedom.  'Hard Work' is just one of those limits I plan<br>
on obliterating!  And so should you.  If you don't, then I would<br>
serious consider you go back to your protestant church and beg<br>
forgiveness!<br>
<p>
