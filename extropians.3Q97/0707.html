Is the Mandelbrot Set real? Well, there are some points that we know for sure <br>
are in The Mandelbrot Set and some points we know for sure are not.  However, <br>
there are other points that we'll never be able to determine to be in the set <br>
or not, and to make things even worse, we can't discriminate  between those<br>
impossible points and those who's status is just difficult to determine. <br>
The bottom line is that we can't know everything about The Mandelbrot Set, <br>
and can't even define the limits of our ignorance, but is that really any <br>
different from any other object? Also,  does OUR ability to have knowledge of <br>
an object determine if it really exists  or not? Actually, if some (not all) <br>
of the interpretations of Quantum  Mechanics are correct then the answer to <br>
that last question is yes.<br>
<p>
This brings up a related question, I've heard it said that The Mandelbrot Set <br>
is the most complex object in mathematics, but is it? The shape is <br>
fantastically complex, as well as beautiful, and it would take a computer an  <br>
infinite amount of time to render it, but the program itself is amazingly <br>
simple, only a few lines long, hell I wrote a Mandelbrot program when I was a  <br>
kid. How could a dumb kid who didn't know his ass from a hole in the ground  <br>
write a program that could, given enough time, produced the most complex  <br>
object in Mathematics?<br>
<p>
Complexity is not as clear cut an idea as it would seem, even the formal   <br>
definitions contain subjective elements, and they don't seem to correspond  <br>
very well with our intuitive understanding of the word. By some standards a  <br>
frog is more "complex" than a human, it certainly contains a lot more DNA.   <br>
             <br>
Some say AIC is a measure of complexity, but there are problems. <br>
The  Algorithmic Information Content (AIC) of a message string can be <br>
found by measuring the length of the smallest computer program that can <br>
produce the string, and that's just another way of asking how much the string <br>
can be compressed. The AIC is largest for random strings because the <br>
smallest program that can produce a truly random string is the string itself, <br>
it's completely incompressible. Accordingly, the gibberish a monkey produces <br>
by banging on a typewriter contains far more information than a Shakespeare <br>
sonnet of the same length. This is almost the exact opposite of what we <br>
usually mean when we say something is complex. Another rather serious problem <br>
with AIC is that we can never find it, we can only find an upper bound. <br>
Greg Chaitin proved a few years ago that in general you can't be certain that <br>
there is not a program shorter than any you know about that will generate the <br>
string.  This also means that although most strings are random and thus <br>
incompressible, you can't prove that any particular string is random. <br>
<p>
Charles Bennett of IBM thinks that in addition to AIC we need another measure  <br>
of complexity he calls "Depth", it's a measure of how long a program must run <br>
to produce its result, not how big the program is. The trillionth's prime <br>
number or the Mandelbrot set can be generated with very short programs, but <br>
they must run for a VERY long time, so they would have very little AIC but<br>
enormous depth.   <br>
<p>
Depth helps but it doesn't solve everything, the works of a monkey are still  <br>
more complex than Shakespeare. I think part of the problem is that all  <br>
information is not of equal value, and it's difficult to get a handle on that <br>
mathematically.  I also think it would be a mistake to equate complexity with  <br>
virtue, in fact all things being equal, the opposite is true. A simple <br>
program is better than a complex one that does the same thing. A simple  <br>
ecosystem such as a temperate forest of oaks and conifers is more resilient  <br>
than a very complex one like a tropical rain forest.                   <br>

You did, but you got Mandelbrot wrong.<br>
