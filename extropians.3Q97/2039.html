I propose that a candidate for this second theory would be a<br>
neurological theory, possibly examining the connections between<br>
activity in (for example)<br>
<p>
the Broca's and Wernicke's areas of the temporal lobe that seem to<br>
be heavily involved in linguistic manipulations and "logical rigor"<br>
<p>
and<br>
<p>
the regions in the brainstem (and limbic system?) involved in<br>
territoriality and aggressiveness.<br>
<p>
Carefully distinguishing between the future fortunes of a meme and<br>
the future fortunes of oneself is a hallmark of civilized behavior,<br>
but I think it takes time for us to become civilized (people aren't<br>
born civilized), and formalized argumentativeness may be a form of<br>
physically-nonrisky display combat (common among animal species)<br>
that helps us learn how to use language and how to pick apart and<br>
analyze ideas.<br>
<p>
Obviously, since the second theory you are requesting is a<br>
neuropsychological one (or at the least the best candidate I<br>
can come up with right now is) the matter will be open to<br>
dispute for at least another few years.  ;)<br>
