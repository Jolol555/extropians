By whom, and for what purpose? your theory now includes:<br>
   1) Hoaxers,<br>
   2) aliens,<br>
   2) conspiracy,<br>
   4) an attempt by the aliens to communicate by essentially<br>
      the most ridiculous and difficult means possible, rather<br>
      than by some simpler means.<br>
<p>
The competing and simpler theory includes:<br>
   1) Hoaxers.<br>
<p>
Please note that crop circles have followed the usual path for<br>
this sort of phenomenon: additional elaborations are "discovered"<br>
only after the original incident is shown to have a natural explanation.<br>
<p>
The people who are initially fooled and go on record end up with<br>
a huge psychological incentive to continue to believe, rather than<br>
recanting and thereby looking foolish, so they selectively<br>
grab at new observations and facts that support their position.<br>
This is called "resolution of cognitive dissonance" and is a<br>
well-known phenomenon.<br>
<p>
This will be my last post on this topic on this list, since<br>
I feel that it is off-topic. I recommend you look into<br>
The psychological phenomena of belief a bit. Try Sagan's<br>
"the Demon-Haunted World" for starts.<br>
<p>
We investigate a lot of radical ideas on this list, but<br>
we try to stay firmly grounded in science. The real universe<br>
is so amazing that IMO pseudo-science trivializes it.<br>
