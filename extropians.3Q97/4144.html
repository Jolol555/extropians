I tend to sigh at the free market/natural selection analogy for the most<br>
part due to the deterministic overtones. But I'll go with it, for the<br>
moment. Just as I should seek to intelligently autoevolve my<br>
biological/mental capacities, shouldn't I also seek to control my fate<br>
in the free market? True biological autoevolution seems to require more<br>
technology than we have at this point. However, while a form of natural<br>
selection *may* exist in the free market, one can directly increase<br>
one's chances at being "selected," or "surviving" within that free<br>
market, far moreso than within the biological system. <br>
<p>
[Developing that point...]<br>
<p>
I'm not entirely sure that I understand you perfectly, but I gather<br>
you're looking for a way to minimize the deleterious effects of free<br>
competition on those that cannot compete as well. You call this "taming"<br>
competition. I'm not sure this makes much sense. Competition seems to be<br>
more a quality of the evolutionary model (that is, more an<br>
organizational component) than a measurable, controllable quantity of<br>
systemic input. In this sense, the more foundational question becomes<br>
not a matter of taming competition, but a matter of taming the *results*<br>
of competition -- or more to the point of your above comment, how do we<br>
increase one's chances of survival WORKING WITHIN THE EVOLUTIONARY<br>
MODEL?<br>
<p>
Rough illustration:<br>
<p>
If someone passed a law barring amoebas from feasting upon paramecium,<br>
all paramecia (pl?) would have an increased chance of survival over<br>
amoebas. That is, amoebas lose a plentiful supply of food, and paramecia<br>
lose a predator. This is nice for the paramecia, but thwarts evolution<br>
in an obvious way.       <br>
<p>
In a similar way, to pass a law affecting the competitive relationship<br>
between the successful and unsuccessful actors in the free market<br>
thwarts evolution and at the same time, glosses over the real problem --<br>
that is, the presence of more unselected characteristics in the<br>
unsuccessful actors. <br>
<p>
So then what is the solution? I would argue that the problem can be<br>
solved entirely without laws affecting competition, and at the same<br>
time, within the parameters of the evolutionary model itself. The<br>
solution is to grant the unsuccessful actor the same selected<br>
characteristics exhibited by the successful actors.<br>
<p>
How do we accomplish this? Make a list of the selected characteristics<br>
based upon a group of successful actors, and publish them along with<br>
detailed steps for acquiring them. My guess is that these steps will<br>
probably encompass equal parts of autopsychological retraining,<br>
practical skills, broad education, and access to information. Books like<br>
Stephen R. Covey's _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ are a start<br>
in this direction. The interdisciplinary requirements of this approach,<br>
IMO, lend it credibility as a solution.  <br>
<p>
What do you think?<br>
