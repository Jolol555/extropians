<i>&gt; insightful experimenter who a guids the process with his knowledge </i><br>

<i>&gt; people tend to confuse them.</i><br>
<p>
Good points. I have a skeleton for an essay at home where I discuss<br>
the 'P' word ("progress") and why we seldom use it (short answer:<br>
positivism is no longer fashionable in these postmodern times),<br>
instead saying "evolution" and "development", mixing things up a<br>
bit.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Design is good at jumping over deserts in the fitness landscape,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; while evolution is good at searching it</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This would seem to lead to the prediction that the more that is known </i><br>
<i>&gt; the less useful will evolutionary computing be. </i><br>
<p>
Yes and no. Suppose you are a near-omniscient jupiter brain. You can<br>
see the entire fitness landscape (or more correctly, the entire game<br>
matrix) and find the best strategy if there is one; you might<br>
realize that your immune system cannot defend against nanite X, so<br>
your equally smart enemy will defeat you in any case since it also<br>
knows this. So in this case you will either survive, be destroyed or<br>
face a somewhat uncertain future (when both players play mixed<br>
strategies). <br>
<p>
But can even a jupiter brain see the entire fitness landscape and<br>
find the global optimum? The space of possible designs is very, very<br>
large (I would argue that it is at least of cardinality aleph zero<br>
for physical designs, and the space of possible shapes is of<br>
cardinality aleph two in a continous world). Even a planet-sized<br>
brain would not be able to contain the combinatorial explosion, and<br>
there might be few general rules as designs include self-organization<br>
and deliberate chaos; since good designs are rare in this space, they<br>
will be valuable and not always easy to find (Moravec has argued<br>
something similar when discussing the economy of Exes). <br>
<p>
So even a very bright individual might discern the global fitness<br>
maximum in a subspace of immune designs, but can not handle the full<br>
space. That suggests that genetic methods can be useful to find<br>
unexpected new possibilities and search through it for new maxima not<br>
amenable to intelligent search. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; As an example, assume the worst scenario happens and an escaped badly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; programmed dishwashing nanite starts to turn all organic life</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why just organic life? Why not dead organic substances, earth, etc. </i><br>
<i>&gt; And is there any good reason why it could not change the earth crust </i><br>
<i>&gt; into something with a higher binding energy?</i><br>
<p>
Energy is the problem here. While I think a workable nanite based on<br>
silicates could be made, the biosphere is the major source of<br>
high-energy chemicals on this planet. So it is the easiest target and<br>
most useful; eating rocks would require so much energy that the<br>
growth would be slow and the threat fairly minimal. And the earth's<br>
crust appears to be at a very deep energy minimum, I don't see how<br>
you could get further without tremendous amounts of energy. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; into</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; more of itself. It will spread with the speed of an bacterial</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; infection, and be quite deadly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why couldn't it spread much faster? Bacteria are limited to some </i><br>
<i>&gt; specifid kinds of hosts, the nanites could attack any organic </i><br>
<i>&gt; material and many inorganic ones too.</i><br>
<p>
I based this on Drexler's calculations of replication. Bacteria are<br>
actually quite good replicators, thermodynamics seems to place some<br>
limits to replication speed at a certain energy level (and you cannot<br>
get much more than 1000 W/m^2 on the surface of the earth). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And if they were deliberately designed, they could transform</i><br>
<i>&gt; themself to missiles after they had eaten enough, and then swoosh</i><br>
<i>&gt; accross the seven sees in a very short time. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, yes. But I'm trying to discuss the immune system problem here,<br>
not the deliberate weapons use problem (as I pointed out in my last<br>
posting). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They might have to go there pretty quickly, like after a nuclear </i><br>
<i>&gt; alert. They will have to make sure that not a single little nanite </i><br>
<i>&gt; finds a way in. They will have to hope that the nanite doesn't eat </i><br>
<i>&gt; rocks and cement. They will have a limited time to figure out how to </i><br>
<i>&gt; use their very limited resources to eliminate a enemy that already </i><br>
<i>&gt; forms a think deadly layer over the whole earth. They have to hope </i><br>
<i>&gt; that the nanites weren't deliberately designed to pile up explosives </i><br>
<i>&gt; on top of their bunker and blow it all away. --Yes, they *could* make </i><br>
<i>&gt; it, at least in a Hollywood movie...</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, who is talking about Hollywood movies here? :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm sorry, but it does seem to me a bit like wishful thinking (and </i><br>
<i>&gt; reading to much SF?). I think I will call this the </i><br>
<i>&gt; go-hide-in-your-basement solution to the antiproliferation problem.</i><br>
<p>
Again, we seem to be arguing about two different things. This isn't a<br>
solution to proliferation (although I like your term for it), this is<br>
a scenario explaining why intelligence is likely to survive at least<br>
a bit into a genetic takeover and likely influence the new ecology. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;, and then it would just evolve in an ordinary</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; way</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (Unless it was designed not to evolve.)</i><br>
<p>
Good point. Most nanites would definitely have adekvate safeguards<br>
against evolution, it is so bad for business. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The remarks you made seem predicated on the assumption that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; nanites will be comparable to a particularly virulent biological </i><br>
<i>&gt; plague. Suppose that this isn't true. Then the only method for </i><br>
<i>&gt; avoiding disaster in a society where there are many independet </i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals with full technological access is to have some kind of </i><br>
<i>&gt; active nanotech immune system.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that is entirely true. Once you have parasites, you need an<br>
immune system. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The first is if all the material were already very close to its </i><br>
<i>&gt; lowest energy state, so that no more reactions were economical. Does </i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone have a good design for a computer that would work under those </i><br>
<i>&gt; circumstances (we would all be uploads then).</i><br>
<p>
Well, I think the rod-logic of drexler would do quite fine here. One<br>
could imagine silicate nanocomputers covering the earth with a thick<br>
and inert surface. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The second is to have the immune system quickly eliminating any </i><br>
<i>&gt; plagues, and it could use the fact that it has access to more energy. </i><br>
<i>&gt; A good design for this?</i><br>
<p>
I have been working on a system, but it is not yet written up.<br>
Basically, it will depend on what you want to defend. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Aha, I just thought of a third way. The independent folks could all </i><br>
<i>&gt; live in a virtual reality that were designed so they could do no </i><br>
<i>&gt; major harm. They would have no access to the real reality, which </i><br>
<i>&gt; would be ruled by a single entity.</i><br>
<p>
And how do you trust the independents to not figure out how to<br>
subvert reality in some way, or the entity to wield its power well?<br>
