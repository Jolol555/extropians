Ok, this does it...<br>
<p>
The following massive rant is meant for all those questioning the<br>
idea of meme supremacy (some memes are [a lot] better than<br>
others and one is the best [for all people, eventhough they may<br>
not understand this yet]: ****the transhuman meme/complex****).<br>
<p>
Whites rule the world. They have been at the top for a couple of<br>
centuries, and will remain there for a long time to come *unless*<br>
their inflated sanctimonious ego's cause them to let the awesome,<br>
unprecedented power they have today, slip through their fingers.<br>
If this happens we're all *screwed*: whites, 3rd world countries,<br>
"developing democracies" worldwide etc, *and* the EXTROPIANS<br>
who can *only* exist in a technologically advanced, reasonably<br>
free and rational WHITE society. Ever wondered why (virtually?)<br>
all transhumanists are white, why "The Meme" only has (limited)<br>
success in *white* or at least higly *westernized* areas? Maybe the<br>
others just can't *grasp* it, maybe it's just way beyond them like<br>
the concept of "infinity". Maybe...their *genetic programming* <br>
simply doesn't "allow" them to think that far...*ever*. <br>
<p>
Suggestions of meme and gene equality are rediculous delusions,<br>
wishful thinking or outright *lies*. If you didn't think that the extropian<br>
memes are the best, you wouldn't call yourself an Extropian...I<br>
mean: what would be the point?!  Does anyone on this list seriously<br>
belief that memes that *fool people* with nonsense about heavenly<br>
rewards or whatever, thus keeping them from serious scientific<br>
life extension methods, are ok? These memes *kill* the host,<br>
is that in the host's benefit? Can you call death *succes*? Can<br>
you call a miserable, misguided life ("all will be good when I die,<br>
I'll go to heaven to collect my reward") *good*, is it the same as<br>
a life that is eternal and a celebration of the senses? Would you<br>
recommend a life of suffering, hard work and greyness to *anyone*?<br>
Sometimes "tolerance" can be a killer...when it means you let <br>
people (slowly) kill themselves and do nothing only because "interference"<br>
could be seen as "intolerance". I'm not saying <br>
that it's anyones "duty" to "save the world or whatever", but a<br>
little less sanctimoniousness would be nice...<br>
<p>
All memes and races are equal, some are just more equal than<br>
others...get it? <br>
<p>
Not all memes are "attainable" for all people. If this were the case,<br>
the transhuman/extropian meme would have spread like wildfire<br>
and would by now dominate the world, because it is the most *rational* one<br>
by far. So most people aren't rational. They don't<br>
(dare to) "think big". If one would look at the topography of trans-<br>
humanism one would find a *relatively* "great" concentration in the LA<br>
area, and the US in general. Also there would be some<br>
"action" in the UK, Germany, the Nordic countries Australia and Canada.<br>
There are some other countries with some (a handful) of<br>
transhumanists but they're few and hardly worth counting (I found 1<br>
transhumanist in [...]! wow!) Now if we look at the people themselves, we<br>
see [ surprise, surprise!] mostly ***white, higher<br>
educated males***. Relatively few females, some Asians,<br>
Hispanics...Indians? Negroes?? None???? Isn't Extropy supposed<br>
to be "the extend of a system's *intelligence*, information,vitality,<br>
diversity and capacity for improvement"? So, I now conclude, using<br>
*your* (official extropic) tools that white males are the most extropic<br>
creatures on earth, that women tend to be more entropic than men,<br>
and that whites are hugely more extropic than other "ethnic groups",<br>
although there are disgustingly few extropians and "the world" should<br>
bow it's head in shame...<br>
<p>
Note: the "hidden Extropian" can be ignored in this little "test", <br>
because a *real* Extropian will try to (and in this age of internet<br>
etc. almost certainly *will*) get in touch with others of his kind in<br>
order to have fun and to network. Am I wrong?<br>
<p>
That's the "bad" news.<br>
<p>
The good news is that brains will almost certainly be "reprogrammable" in<br>
the future, thus giving ultimately all people<br>
access to all memes, but more importantly the "Master Meme"<br>
which brings eternal life, knowledge, freedom and happiness. <br>
<p>
The bad news is: it might take a while. *But* we have increasingly<br>
better cryonic suspension capabilities and an increasinly greater<br>
lifespan due to better medical care, food etc, so there is hope.<br>
<p>
This is an ongoing experiment, and I'm quite sure the future will<br>
prove me completely right (actually, I feel like I'm explaining that<br>
the eart isn't flat to a bunch of hard core Christian "believers", the<br>
facts [see above] are so painfully clear that I can hardly believe how<br>
otherwise obviously rational people can deny them...is it some kind of<br>
misplaced guilt trip???<br>
