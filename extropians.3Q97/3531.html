Speaking for myself, I think the objection is to hard work to satisfy<br>
someone else's goals.  There's a difference between working 100 hours a<br>
week to produce Babylon-5 and working 80 hours in a fashion industry<br>
sweatshop, or picking fruit, or even 40 hours being the pointy-haired<br>
boss.  Not to mention doing this all of one's life.<br>
<p>
We automated agriculture, and moved people to industry.  We've automated<br>
industry, and moved people to 'service'.  We're automating much of<br>
service now.  Will we move people to art, science, and playful <br>
engineering?  Or even random hedonism?<br>

<p>
Not that I'm complaining much for my own sake.  I'm doing fairly well as<br>
far as life satisfaction goes.  And if people were more frugal, less<br>
consumerist, they could be much better off.  The father of one of my<br>
friends is an oral surgeon, with quite good income.  And constant money<br>
worries, because his expenditures are even greater.  And we're not<br>
talking student loans.  More like "let's get a new car!  Let's get a new<br>
girlfriend!"  I have little sympathy.<br>
<p>
Still, if it could actually work, I'd much rather live in the Culture<br>
than in the Beyond.  Does anyone who has read both Banks and Vinge<br>
disagree?<br>
