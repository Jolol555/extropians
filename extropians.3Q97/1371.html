[This post is for those who have been keeping up with the current<br>
homosexual activism thread.]<br>
<p>
Assertion 1: Representative democracy is, inter alia, an attempt to<br>
avoid the power of "faction" (Madison: Federalist Papers). This is<br>
accomplished by allowing any group to organize and push its interests,<br>
but then diluting the power of those interests at the legislative level<br>
via compromise.<br>
<p>
Assertion 2: Thus, any interest group, in order to effect change<br>
comporting with its views, must adopt a "radical" position such that the<br>
diluted form is acceptable to its members. (Ex: NRA, NOW, Greenpeace,<br>
etc.)<br>
<p>
IMO, the perceived radicality of gay activists (colors, rings, parades,<br>
banners, protests, &amp;c.) is merely a reaction to the system in which it<br>
is required to work. Hell, I can envision an extropian march on<br>
Washington -- or better yet, let's all move to Oceania (pretty damn<br>
extreme, don't you think?) <br>
<p>
Extremism (and heresy) is how we change the world.<br>
