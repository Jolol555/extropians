In a message dated 97-08-23 01:39:37 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Lots of things can be argued, but the notion that children, arbitrarily<br>
 defined, are either chattel of the parents or chattel of the state, and<br>
 that the former view "would have to be the libertarian position" is <br>
 seriously troubling to me.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Yep...lots of things can be argued...but it seems that they gotta be one or<br>
the other..saying that they "own themselves"...yet are "wards of the state"<br>
or "wards of their parents" is a bit contradictory isn't it?<br>
<p>
Seems that's why the name "children"...when one ceases to be of that category<br>
then one is responsible  for(i.e. "owns") oneself. The boundry of that<br>
classification being defined by culture, law etc.<br>
<p>
My position is that it's none of my business what someone else does...with<br>
his dog..his property...or his children...however reprehensible or noble it<br>
may be...as long as I have no responsibility...am not damaged....then I have<br>
no authority..and would be well advised to mind my own business.<br>
<p>
I and society...have no moral athority to intervene. The most I can do is<br>
disapprove....and/or disassociate myself with that person and his<br>
activities....I think the Jews used a technique...shunning....towards similar<br>
ends....in times past.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;If you have responsibility then you must have authority to enforce the<br>
necesities of that responsibility...the two are coupled.  The current<br>
situation is de-coupled...as a result it's all screwed up&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Any other position puts me in a position of<br>
(superiority/authority:responsible for his actions)  over that person...Slave<br>
Owner...which I am not and don't intend to be...however much some beg to be<br>
owned. Nor do I enjoy BEING owned...as is the current state of<br>
affairs...hopefully the advancing technology will continue the age-old trend<br>
of diminishing the power of the state....(slavers).relative to that of the<br>
populance (slaves)<br>
<p>
And I "am" saying that...now.<br>
