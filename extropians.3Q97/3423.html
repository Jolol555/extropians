<i>&gt;From one of my favorite "bad boys" / contrarians, Don Lancaster:</i><br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.tinaja.com/glib/muse115.pdf">http://www.tinaja.com/glib/muse115.pdf</a><br>
<p>
You'll need Acrobat Reader 3.0 to read it.<br>
<p>
Don makes the obvious-once-you-see-it point that with today's technology,<br>
hydrogen is just a way of moving pollution, not eliminating it. Further,<br>
<p>
"_No non-nuclear means is currently known to generate hydrogen that can<br>
deliver more in energy BTU's than it consumes!_ [emphasis his] Thus....<br>
[it] can only raise your cost of energy."<br>
<p>
Lancaster also makes the point that if it takes ten gallons of gasoline to<br>
farm plants that you can turn into six gallons of pure grain alcohol,<br>
you're still *really* on the losing end of the stick. (smacks forehead)<br>
"Dooohhh!"<br>
<p>
Indirect costs once again bite us in the behind--those Carboniferous<br>
swamps and the sunshine that fell on them and all that time Gaia spent<br>
squeezing the resulting compost still turn out to provide _us_, right now,<br>
with a BTU profit even after we extract and refine. Yes, this is living<br>
off the principal. No, one can't do it forever. But Gaia wasn't doing a<br>
whole lot with it...<br>
<p>
So it looks as if (maybe) the best we can do overall might be to crack<br>
hydrocarbons all the way down to methane, then use a fuel cell on _that_<br>
and accept some resulting CO2. Finding a cheap catalyst for the fuel cells<br>
is still a holy grail.<br>
<p>
Don points out some other gotchas, too. And some interesting but<br>
unconfirmed work on nanotubule storage of hydrogen. Worth the read.<br>
Joe-Mike says check it out.<br>
