I think our disagreement is only a matter of emphasis. I feel that<br>
the inovations (usually of a technical nature) drive the whole<br>
process. In the case of downsizing, nearly all the analysis of<br>
the phenomenon have centered on the resulting behavioral changes,<br>
and not on the underlying technical change. It's true that<br>
the behavior is interesting, but it typically lags far behind<br>
the enabling technology because habits are hard to change. You<br>
usually have to wait for the older generation to retire: look<br>
at the ages of the folks who still have secretaries. One should<br>
be able to predict organizational changes by looking at new<br>
technology, but we don't do a good job of this. In essence, the PC<br>
is automating a lot of management jobs out of existance. This trend<br>
should have been predictable with the advent of the computer.<br>
Instead, we worried about automation of productins jobs, which<br>
mostly didn't happen: workers mostly just became a lot more<br>
productive.<br>
<p>
You mention that the PC is neither the beginning nor the end,<br>
and you are quite correct. As a simple example, the typewriter<br>
brought the secretary's job into existance, and the PC abolished<br>
it. The computer revolution is accelerating, and will IMO lead<br>
within the next 9 years to the development of an SI that will<br>
change our current society beyond comprehension. This is an<br>
extreme example of technology driving organizational change.<br>
If unforseen factors prevent the SI development we will still<br>
see radical organizatinal changes based on computers. Many of<br>
the advantages of a large company disappear when each individual<br>
can use a PC to do the jobs that were traditionally done by the<br>
corporate infrastructure: billing, accounting, payroll, taxes,<br>
purchasing, contracting, etc. These capabilities are automatable,<br>
and this is what permits an individual to easily become a<br>
contractor instead of an employee. With the advent of the Web,<br>
other aspects of running a business become accsible to the<br>
individual, such as advertizing, sales, customer support,<br>
and marketing. It will take a while for society to learn<br>
to use these new tools, but we should in theory be able<br>
to predict some of the consequences.<br>
