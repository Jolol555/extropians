quoth E.Shaun--<br>
:         Actually, there may be a *little* bit of truth in what Danny is<br>
: saying.  Feeding off of my geology experience, I seem to recall that there<br>
: are two different forms of tectonic movement: convergent and divergent.<br>
: When a divergent tectonic movement takes place, the plates split apart,<br>
: causing magma to escape...a perfect example is Iceland which is always<br>
: splitting and growing igneous rock.  Convergent movement is when two plates<br>
: collide or "converge" producing magma in that way.  What I presume Danny is<br>
: getting at is that there may be a large convergent movement without a<br>
: head-on collision, causing the pole or continent to move.  However,<br>
: though this is conceptually a possibility (isn't everything!?),<br>
<p>
I don't get it.  Yes, the plates move in different directions,<br>
that's obvious.  If every pair of nearby plates were converging<br>
(or diverging), the planet would have to be shrinking (or growing).<br>
I can't visualize what Shaun is suggesting here - that two plates<br>
may approach each other without colliding?  Or that some collisions<br>
have a lateral component (that can't be surprising)?<br>
<p>
: it has never happened before on this planet (as far as anyone knows)<br>
: and the odds of it happening are tremendously infinitessimal.<br>
<p>
Yeah, I'd say it's unlikely for all the plates at once<br>
to come loose from the mantle and race about.<br>
<p>
On another hand, remembering Haldane's Rule --<br>
I saw something on teevee that said the surface of Venus is determined<br>
from crater counts to be all about the same age; okay that isn't<br>
disturbing, except that the age appears to be HALF a billion years!<br>
What caused that catastrophe, and is it likely to happen again?<br>
<p>
: P.S.: Just to clarify something, Hawaii is a bit of an anomaly.  It was<br>
:   --and is being-- formed by weaknesses in the seafloor which were<br>
:   punctured under pressure.  These punctures sent up spits of magma in<br>
:  the form of pillow basalts which, in turn, created the Hawaiian<br>
: islands.  The punctures still prove to be very active in Hawaii<br>
: judging by the high amount of volcanic activity...it is probable that<br>
:       within the next million years there will be many more Hawaiian<br>
:       islands...and more opportunities to trap future tourists!  ;~)<br>
<p>
Blaming Hawaii on weak spots seems to put the cart before the horse.<br>
The conventional story, as I understand it, has a "hot spot" of rising<br>
magma (cause unknown) which, as the Pacific Plate moves over it, pushes<br>
volcanoes through.  Presumably every plate has weak points where magma<br>
is more likely to get through than the surrounding area; that's why<br>
Hawaii is a sequence of cones and not a single long ridge.<br>
