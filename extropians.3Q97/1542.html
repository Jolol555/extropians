            <br>
<p>
I like reductionism for purely pragmatic reasons, it produces results, the <br>
competition doesn't. Prove me wrong and I'll be happy to dump reductionism  <br>
for something better. I'm not holding my breath.<br>
             <br>

            <br>
<p>
I agree, Dawkins would too.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I think the evidence still indicates that genes mutate randomly</i><br>
        <br>
<p>
Evolution theorists like Dawkins like to emphasize the random nature of  <br>
mutation to show that you can still produce structures of staggering <br>
complexity provided you have the other the other half of evolution, natural <br>
selection. Darwin would have no problem dealing in non random mutations and <br>
in fact in the real world mutation is mostly random but not completely. <br>
For chemical reasons some "hot spots" on the chromosome are more likely to <br>
have mutations than others.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Hosts can invent new memes and try to spread them! However, only         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the rich and powerful segments of a society can make a new meme         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;operational through a whole culture </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
So what, Dawkins never said all hosts are created equal. As for the whole <br>
culture, genes don't give a damn about that or even about the welfare of the <br>
individual they inhabit, natural selection works at a lower level.  The gene <br>
is only interested in reproducing itself. By analogy Dawkins is saying the <br>
same thing is true for ideas and gave it a name, "meme".<br>
<p>
- From the species point of view females are much more important than males, <br>
one male could service dozens of females so you don't need as many of them. <br>
Take elephant seals for example, just 4% of the males are the father of 88%  <br>
of the baby seals, most males never reproduce at all but they still live long <br>
lives and eat lots of valuable food. If natural selection operated at the<br>
species level you would expect many more females to be born with enough males <br>
to just barely handle it, the species would be better off but that's not what <br>
happens, the sex ratio is still 50- 50. In such a world producing a daughter <br>
would mean 2 or 3 grandchildren with your genes,  producing a son would mean<br>
hundreds and that pushes the pendulum back toward the 50% sex ratio.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Memes that engender war, for instance, may create a successful         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Imperialist culture that spreads through military force.  Just look         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;at history.</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
True, that means that those infected with the "it's good to die for your  <br>
country" meme must have been able to infect at least one other person before <br>
the meme killed him. As I said, the meme doesn't give a damn about the <br>
individual, it just wants to spread.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Notice how the Establishment periodically cracks down on "conspiracy         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;theory memes"?</i><br>
                <br>
No.             <br>
                <br>
<i>        &gt;Conspiracy memes are quite infectious </i><br>
                <br>
Obviously.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;partly because there is a large element of truth</i><br>
         <br>
I doubt it.<br>
<p>
         <br>
<i>       &gt;Admit it!  You [Anders Sandberg] just want to be in memetic resonance        </i><br>
<i>       &gt;with the powers that be!  ...the manipulators of the State!</i><br>
         <br>
<p>
Oh come now James, I've never seen the slightest evidence that Anders is a <br>
lackey for the state! Somebody can disagree with you without being a  <br>
government agent.<br>
