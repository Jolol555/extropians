<i>&gt; then we'd see a very drastic increase in the global standard of</i><br>
<i>&gt; living.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, some of the comfortable people living in the more</i><br>
<i>&gt; lucrative markets would be disturbed by having to compete with poor</i><br>
<i>&gt; and hungry people on the labor market, which is why such laws exist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is the answer to your question: the greed and indifference of</i><br>

<p>
Good luck.  I consider myself to be a pragmatic idealist:  Winning isn't<br>
everything, but failure isn't anything.  I suppose I could tear down the<br>
entire sociopolitical structure of the world if I really had to, but it just<br>
seems easier to redesign the economy along more efficient lines - design an<br>
economy that is to capitalism what capitalism is to communism.  I suppose with<br>
a bit of an effort you could direct everyone's enormous frustration with<br>
modern society towards the greed and indifference of... who, exactly? <br>
Certainly your meme has better survival potential than my elaborate redesigns.<br>
 But my elaborate redesigns do not require memetic attractiveness, only a base<br>
population of early adopters.<br>
<p>
There are also multiple and beneficial streamline-and-transparency changes to<br>
government that would get piggybacked onto #4 and even complex barter.  I<br>
think governmental changes have a better chance if they aren't strictly<br>
political issues.  Challenge the government and you create an enormous public<br>
conflict; quietly obsolete a few parts through technology, and the bureaucrats<br>
stand alone.<br>
