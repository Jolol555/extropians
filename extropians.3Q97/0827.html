     Guru George wrote to Danny:<br>
     <br>
     My worry was that you just seem to be a wee bit hostile to, and<br>
     uncomprehending of, science.  You see, it's not that scientists are<br>
     trying to spoil anything or get one over on you, it's that they want <br>
     to get things right, and the best way to do that is to test, <br>
     criticise, and test again. This may *seem* destructive, but in the <br>
     end, it is destructive only of falsehood.<br>
     <br>
     Rick appends:<br>
     <br>
     We really do rely on the perspectives that each bring to the table.  <br>
     Testing for empirical evidence (which I have playfully taunted in <br>
     previous posts) is a key component in discovery.  Each of us can get <br>
     dug in to extremes though.  Guru George is making a valid point Danny, <br>
     watch your trigger finger... &lt;G&gt;<br>
