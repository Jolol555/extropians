John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt; gave a great summary of the everett<br>
interpretation...<br>
<p>
	As you know, from our previous discussions with the subject:<br>
"upload", I'm very much interested in studying conscious perception<br>
and it's philosophical implications.  This subject obviously overlaps<br>
in this area of quantum "collapsing wave functions" by conscious<br>
perception or whatever.  I've always had many questions about some of<br>
this that I've always wanted to ask of an expert like you on this<br>
topic.  Perhaps you (or anyone) can help me out a bit with answers to<br>
some of these?<br>
<p>
	You described the experiment:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A conscious quantum computer shoots electrons at a metal plate that</i><br>
<i>&gt; has 2 small slits in it.</i><br>
<p>
	First off, could you define what this "conscious quantum<br>
computer" is and is not?  In particular, how must it sense and<br>
represent information?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The quantum mind has detectors near each slit so it knows which slit</i><br>
<i>&gt; the various electrons went through.</i><br>
<p>
	As we discussed before in the other thread, when WE<br>
consciously "detect" things, it is done via a complex cause and effect<br>
sensing process that ultimately results in a conscious model or<br>
awareness of the event sensed in our brain or conscious mind.  Our<br>
conscious sensing mechanism could be spofed by something like<br>
directly stimulating the optic nerve producing an indistinguishable<br>
conscious awareness, even though the awareness was of nothing real and<br>
we, in fact, might not have an eye or sensor at all.<br>
<p>
	Please describe what you mean by "The quantum mind has<br>
detectors..."  How must this perception process work?  Could the<br>
causal connection between the "detectors" and the conscious<br>
representations in this "quantum computer" be similarly spofed in an<br>
indistinguishable way as our conscious perception process can be?  In<br>
other words would it work if you, in fact, had no sensors, but feed<br>
the identical information that would have come from the sensors to the<br>
quantum consciousness?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In the Copenhagen interpretation when the results of a measurement</i><br>
<i>&gt; enters the consciousness of an observer the wave function collapses,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in effect all the universes except one disappear, so you get no</i><br>
<i>&gt; interference.</i><br>
<p>
	So, if I removed my eyes, cutting the optic nerves, (rendering<br>
me blind yet keeping them operational) and configured them to sense<br>
such an event and I recorded the data coming from the optic nerve of<br>
these removed eyes and never consciously observed this data for many<br>
years... then I created a virtual reality simulation of the experiment<br>
in the distant future which directly stimulated my optic nerve that<br>
was long ago separated from the eyes with the recorded data in such a<br>
way that the data going to my consciousness was indistinguishable to<br>
what would have gone to my consciousness at the time of the actual<br>
experiment had I not cut the optic nerves before they observed the<br>
event...  what would happen?  Would the wave function of this event<br>
not collapse until I consciously represented the event in my mind many<br>
years in the future?  Can you see the problem I have with all this?  I<br>
find such extreme enduring "superimposed states" all very absurd.<br>
<p>
	Why is it that the representational nature of our<br>
consciousness and the completely separate and arbitrary relationship<br>
between what our "detectors" detect and the awareness that eventually<br>
causally results always completely left out of any of this kind of<br>
reasoning about consciousness collapsing of quantaum waves in spite of<br>
it's critical importance to this topic?  It's as if everyone that<br>
talks about this has never thought or read about what the perception<br>
process is or must be and I find it all troubling and very hard to<br>
swallow.<br>
<p>
	Surely any old physical "macro" event, any computer (quantum<br>
or not) that records and represents the information, or even the<br>
information traveling up the optic nerve or a rod or cone neuronn in<br>
the retina firring... can do just as much to "collapse" a wave as<br>
phenomenal conscious representations can.  Occam's razor says this<br>
must be true.  What reason is there for attributing the collapse to<br>
something causally so far away from and so arbitrarily associated with<br>
the actual quantum event being "detected"?<br>
