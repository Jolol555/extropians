Hi!<br>

This is a condensed version of "Why are We Allowed to Age?", an essay<br>
written by me on the subject of evolution of aging. The full text,<br>
hopefully, will be available next week at,<br>
<a href="http://homepage.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/science/why.htm">http://homepage.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/science/why.htm</a><br>
<p>
                      Why Are We Allowed to Age?<br>
(...)<br>
                        Is Aging a Bad Thing?<br>
(...)<br>
          The main, natural, objective of any living creature is to<br>
reproduce. To<br>
          survive long enough to pass on it's genes to the next<br>
generation.<br>
          Natural selection, selects the genes that can produce the<br>
higher numbers<br>
          of the most fit offspring whereas fitness is defined as the<br>
capacity to<br>
          produce fit offspring.<br>
(...)<br>
          This is roughly the explanation for the evolution of aging<br>
given by Peter<br>
          Medawar already some time ago. Basically, although aging is,<br>
individually,<br>
          a bad thing, there is no evolutionary pressure to spread<br>
longer longevity<br>
          genes if no individuals reach an old age.<br>
(...)<br>
          One question still troubled me when I found about this, in<br>
higher animals<br>
          on top of the food chain that can have long gestation periods<br>
and have<br>
          some, few, chances of reaching old age, wasn't aging a cause<br>
of death?<br>
<p>
          We never witness extremely old animals in the wild because<br>
they die<br>
          before it can happen. But many still die in consequence of<br>
aging! In the<br>
          competitive world wild animals live, a small loss in it's<br>
skills is usually<br>
          lethal and this loss must be done by aging in many cases.<br>
          Medawar's explanation is not, IMHO, good enough for some<br>
species.<br>
(...)<br>
          I used computer models to simulate the effects of an extra<br>
longevity trait<br>
          in ancient human populations and I reached the conclusion that<br>
it would<br>
          take hundreds of generations for this kind of traits to<br>
implement<br>
          themselves in the gene pool.1<br>
          (...) although the good gene is not the most<br>
          common type, it will eventually spread in the population after<br>
a certain<br>
          period of time.<br>
(...)<br>
          It is, at least for me, an unargumentable fact that there is<br>
evolutionary<br>
          pressure for some species to extend their lives. And we still<br>
age... <br>
<p>
                         Why do We Still Age?<br>
<p>
          One theory of why do we still age claims that in order for<br>
higher species<br>
          like ours and other mammals to have a more complex structure,<br>
the price<br>
          we pay is that we age. Although simplistic I enjoy this theory<br>
but I don't<br>
          see aging as a price but as a choice, a irrational, random<br>
choice made by<br>
          our genes millions ago.<br>
<p>
          If we look at our genotype as a computer program, we will see<br>
that our<br>
          computer program is much more complex and detailed than the<br>
non-aging<br>
          species computers programs. If I write a very complex computer<br>
          program, chances are it will have mistakes or bugs but if I<br>
write a simple<br>
          one, these chances decrease.<br>
<p>
          We all started as a very simple computer program and then we<br>
started to<br>
          become more complex, we started to have new procedures and<br>
          extensions to the program. Some programmers prefer to make<br>
sure<br>
          everything is working fine with their work so far before<br>
proceeding to the<br>
          next appendix but others just keep adding more and more<br>
procedures<br>
          before completely checking the previous ones.<br>
          I think this is what happened in evolution. Some species<br>
worked their<br>
          way to make the programs they have to work perfectly while<br>
others,<br>
          preferred to add new extensions to their programs while the<br>
previous<br>
          ones were not yet working fine. I see aging as a phenomenon<br>
derived<br>
          from mistakes in our programs or, biologically, in our genes.<br>
Non-aging<br>
          species are less complex and have successfully corrected their<br>
mistakes<br>
          as the generation succeeded one other inexorably.<br>
 (...)<br>
                  How do We Correct this Errors?<br>
(...)<br>
          I believe there are errors much more important than others,<br>
perhaps with<br>
          just one error corrected we can live up to a thousand years. I<br>
don't think<br>
          this is likely because if this was the case, natural selection<br>
would already<br>
          had made us live up to a thousand years. My opinion is that<br>
there are<br>
          huge numbers of mistakes that cause aging.<br>
          Not only must we correct this errors but we will also have to<br>
correct the<br>
          errors that will affect us in the future (say, after 300<br>
years). If, with<br>
          already some evolutionary pressure being made, we only live<br>
until a<br>
          maximum of about 120 imagine the genetic trash that exist<br>
after 120<br>
          years! All lethal genes of retarded effect will be there, it<br>
will be a<br>
          monumental performance.<br>
(...)<br>
<p>
I hope it's not too boring, I cut several parts (more than 50%).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Also, there are certainly lethal genes that are active when you are,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; say, 200 years old and you will have to deal with them too with the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; difference being the fact than no-one even knows they exist. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, but as soon as we have solved that genetic problem (which may</i><br>
<i>&gt; be hard), then the solution can be applied to all people. This is just</i><br>
<i>&gt; a limit on how fast lifespan can be increased (and something to</i><br>
<i>&gt; worry about for us first-generation transhumans). </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think our main difference lies in optimism: you see a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; problems, I see a lot of hard problems that can be solved, at least</i><br>
<i>&gt; in principle. </i><br>
<p>
I see problems waiting for a solution but try to face the problems and<br>
not be carried away in my dreams. <br>
<p>
Nice talking to you, sorry for the long message,<br>
