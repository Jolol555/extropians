Agreed. As usual, words have more than one meaning. I have no problem with<br>
"compassion" in this sense -- it becomes part of what I mean by<br>
benevolence. Still I prefer the latter since it doesn't (for me at least)<br>
connote undesirable behaviors.<br>
<p>
BTW, when I said that some recent posts did not make the distinction<br>
between compassion and benevolence, I certainly wasn't including Kathryn's.<br>
Her post nicely distinguished them.<br>

I mentioned in an earlier post Nietzsche's suggestion that generosity can<br>
come from not pity but from an overflowing of power and well-being.<br>
Similarly, I suspect that psychological healthy people, having removed<br>
their own suffering, will often be inclined to exercise some of their<br>
talents on those who still suffer (at least where they can do this with<br>
some chance of success). They may do this partly for the directly<br>
self-interested reasons you mention, or simply because it's a rewarding and<br>
challenging exercise of their talents.<br>
