<i>&gt;  Are most of you, extropians, libertarians?</i><br>
<p>
I hope not.  I have a difficult time spotting them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Why do you think free-markets are the best economical solution?</i><br>
<p>
You know you've found the best solution when it can encounter every problem<br>
you come across and not need any change to remain the best solution.<br>
 Free-market systems do exactly this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  In today's world, it's almost impossible to do something without</i><br>
<i>&gt;  affecting other persons, still why do you claim individual freedom and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  an almost cult of individual property so important?</i><br>
<p>
You answered your own question:  "It's impossible to do anything without<br>
affecting other persons" is the reason individual 'freedom' is necessary.  I<br>
don't think individual property is important.  The free market would make<br>
property 'rights' redundant, property belongs to whoever's holding it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Complete freedom in economies will bring to the scene big corporations</i><br>
<i>&gt;  instead of small, local business. Won't this corporations have too much</i><br>
<i>&gt;  power and therefore harming everyone (the consumers and general public)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  but themselves? Do you think the economy should be based on small</i><br>
<i>&gt;  business or big corporations?</i><br>
<p>
This is a common misconception.  The free market would favour short-lived,<br>
agile and small companies.  Most of today's large companies are relatively<br>
old, the critical mass of a company is decreasing constantly.  The free<br>
market will take this futher, the lack of property rights and copyright law<br>
will mean companies will no longer be able to lock consumers into closed<br>
systems.  This will decrease the potential for monopolies and monolithic<br>
corporations.  Even without a free market companies will continue to decrease<br>
in size because of the move to a network economy.  The mass of all companies<br>
in one field is what will drive future economies, rather than each one<br>
striving for complete control.  Expect to see facless corporations being<br>
replaced by small companies that pay more attention to social dynamics and<br>
human factors, and turn over huge profits.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  What do you think of environmental issues? Do you think technology will</i><br>
<i>&gt;  always give us the solutions to all our problems?</i><br>
<p>
If the consumer wants environmental issues addressed, the consumer will get<br>
environmental issues addressed.  Free market business answers to the<br>
consumer, not the government, and the consumer is far more controlling and<br>
far more demanding.  Technology is nothing without implementation.  Free<br>
markets, again due to lack of property rights and copyrights, focus more<br>
marketing energy on the implementation of the technology than the technology<br>
itself.  This is because technology is open to anyone, so in order to stay<br>
ahead, business must implement technology in the best and most innovative<br>
way.  This is positive for progress also, because technology is open, the<br>
entire market is working on its improvement rather than one company that owns<br>
the patent.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;  What do you think the intervention of government in economy should be?</i><br>
<p>
Zero.  To have a truly *free* market you can't have a government at all.<br>
<p>
Did I make it sound good?<br>
<p>
--Wax<br>
<p>
Note: In the context of this mail I'm talking about 'a free market' not 'The<br>
Free Market.'  All the ideas expressed come from applying the concept of<br>
'free' to the concept of 'market.'  As such they are predictions, only<br>
politicians make promises.<br>
