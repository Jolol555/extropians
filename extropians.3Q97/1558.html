I'll make worse. For going deeper with the scientific conclusions, <br>
I prefer to go straight to the points, so the intellectual selection <br>
will be done...As a matter of fact, we are talking in the teacher's <br>
room, and not at the school yard, nor at high school, and not even <br>
just bachelorate level... (although eventual true intelectuals are <br>
always welcome, independently on their academic education...)<br>
Let's go:<br>
<p>
1) Indeed, as a  scientist I know that studying the reallity of <br>
the facts is much better than working in illusion. Even if we <br>
want to give another option to the other... For example, I repeat <br>
that the psychological external factor is important and lots of <br>
blacks will love more themselves and to living  when they can <br>
make genetical skin-hair-eyes treatment...They already try to <br>
strenght their hair... <br>
<p>
2)About the "cultural treatment", untill I have perceived, the <br>
"median" whites will like more to providing it when "pacients" <br>
will be white too.. ( that is not the ideal, but being very rigid, <br>
waiting just for the "conversion" of all to the "perfect <br>
heavenly good", seeing the "brother" as an equal, blablabla, has <br>
already been shown as not very efficient... from both sides...There <br>
is necessity of real acts...) Naked truth: Help a black to feel <br>
better: Make it white... (And we know they will like it...Michael <br>
Jackson is right...See a picture of him before and after...and his <br>
success) ( It seems a little joke but, ev'ry body knows, f.ex., that <br>
Jesus was a hebrew and, very very possibly, black haired, and not so <br>
white skinned. Even though, the first european painters of  "sacred <br>
art" made lots of pictures of a blond-haired, blue-eyed Jesus...and <br>
Mary, angels, etc...why? Projected on the "Perfect" their notions of <br>
perfectness... )<br>
<p>
2)Ask, for ex ., a black woman if she wouldn't love to change her <br>
external characteristics. I said woman, since women have dedicated <br>
more their mind development, in media, associated to external <br>
factors, because of the "Machist" Natural Selection and also because <br>
they generally think a lot (just) in "grow up and marry", instead of <br>
working and earning their money for suviving *for themselves* - by <br>
the way it is much more interesting and... workless... isn't it? <br>
With some exceptions, of course... <br>
<p>
<p>
PS: Sorry and not for the girls. But the human has added an <br>
important tool for its evolution: the conciousness of the <br>
reality... The question for you is: Is this good or better?  Really <br>
wanna see your answers... And evolutive seriousness... Do not forget <br>
we're here not just "Playing God...", but...being better than <br>
such image !...<br>
