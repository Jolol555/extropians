<p>
Sure, but it seems to me that most serious outbreaks of military<br>
disorderliness nowadays are civil wars, not international wars. I<br>
can't think of any reasons to believe that a world government would<br>
be a more effective means of reducing the risk of total annihilation<br>
from civil wars than the current setup, or an even more decentralized<br>
setup.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; What are your grounds for thinking that a reformed, democratic</i><br>
<i> &gt; United Nations would provoke and escalate mote disputes than it</i><br>
<i> &gt; would settle?</i><br>
<p>
Because, for instance, the reformed democratic government that I<br>
endure, the federal government of the United States of America and<br>
its wholly-owned subsidiaries, provokes and escalates more disputes<br>
than it settles.  One could mention the police execution of the<br>
Black Panther leadership in Chicago a couple decades ago, or the<br>
mess in Waco, Texas a few years ago.  And I notice this seems to<br>
be true of governments in general. I wouldn't expect an empowered<br>
United Nations to be very different in this respect.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Many wars seem to originate in differing interpretations of some</i><br>
<i> &gt; legal or historical circumstance. I have often thought, oh, if</i><br>
<i> &gt; there only were an impartial arbiter to which the rivalling nations</i><br>
<i> &gt; could submit their cases, and a responsible international force</i><br>
<i> &gt; that could implement the judgements.</i><br>
<p>
What makes you think that a reformed, democratic United Nations<br>
would be impartial? (Or that their international force would be<br>
responsible, though I find this far easier to imagine than an<br>
impartial United Nations. The current United Nations is<br>
extremely partial.)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; The only realistic candidates in the foreseeable future are either</i><br>
<i> &gt; the UN or a coalition led by the USA. I think it is dubious that</i><br>
<i> &gt; most people would accept the USA as an international Dad in the</i><br>
<i> &gt; long run.  </i><br>
<p>
I think any increase in the influence that the US federal government<br>
has over world affairs would be disastrous.  It has far too much<br>
busybody meddling influence as it is.  I find both of your "realistic<br>
candidates" quite frightening.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I would suggest a reformed UN in which the USA and the</i><br>
<i> &gt; other powers had an influence that were in some proportion to their</i><br>
<i> &gt; real power.  </i><br>
<p>
What the heck is "real power" and how do you propose to measure<br>
it? (I hope you're not going to say "in watts". ;)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; This would presumably also lead to an inefficient</i><br>
<i> &gt; bureaucracy that wastes a few billion dollars per year, but so</i><br>
<i> &gt; what?</i><br>
<p>
I agree with you that this wouldn't be so bad if there were<br>
some counterbalancing benefit to be obtained. But I don't see<br>
any counterbalancing benefit.<br>
