&lt;&lt;  If they really<br>
 are on to something, it would be easy for them to produce some<br>
 dramatic effect showing that significant energy is produced ("do this<br>
 and the lab explodes") that would convince even the sceptics. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
According to Arthur C. Clarke it's for real.  I beleive he said that there<br>
are working devices (hot water heaters) in use by the thousand in the former<br>
Soviet Union.  I also heard that there was a widely publicized demo on one of<br>
the morning TV shows.<br>
<p>
Don't know myself...but from where I stand it appears as plausible as the<br>
explanations I've read concerning Quantum Mechanics. (Everitt<br>
universes...heh..heh)<br>
<p>
They didn't cover that in Truck Driving School...or I missed that day...or I<br>
wouldn't have beleived them anyway since it was run by the gubment and I<br>
mistrust EVERYTHING they say.<br>
