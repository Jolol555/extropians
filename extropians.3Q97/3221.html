<p>
Mockery and humiliation are an important mean of social communication.  Some<br>
ideas, including much pseudo-science, really aren't worth talking or thinking<br>
about, and these techniques help deal with them.  Sometimes the mockers are<br>
incorrect in their judgement, as with, say, quantum mechanics ("God doesn't<br>
play dice with the universe") and evolution ("*my* ancestors weren't apes").<br>
 In those cases the mocked proponents use this as an opportunity to<br>
demonstrate their own cool and the strength of the thought and evidence<br>
behind their ideas.  <br>
<p>
Also, I wouldn't call humiliation "oppression".  Murder is oppression.<br>
 Torture is oppression.  Starvation is oppression.  Denial of education is<br>
oppression.  Isolation from people who want to contact you is oppression.<br>
 All these things deny you the opportunity to live well and improve your<br>
life.  Deserved humiliation is a great way to learn.  I rarely make those<br>
kinds of mistakes twice.<br>

Well, yes.  Humans are what they are, which at present includes being real<br>
suckers for certain types of nonsense.  Debunking, while satisfying, doesn't<br>
really address the root causes.  So more productive lines of inquiry might<br>
be:<br>
<p>
What kinds of nonsense are so attractive (this probably shades more into what<br>
kinds of ideas, correct or not, are attractive)?  What is it that makes them<br>
attractive?<br>
<p>
How can we makes ourselves more resistant to nonsense?  <br>
<p>
Can there be disadvantages to being resistant?  Some human behaviors (fashion<br>
springs to mind) seem to operate through similar mechanisms, even though they<br>
have no truth-value.  Perhaps being "sensible" makes one prone to be<br>
"unstylish"; certainly that's the stereotype of academia.<br>
<p>
How can we make others more resistant to nonsense?<br>
<p>
Can we, and should we, exploit those who cannot or will not become more<br>
resistant?<br>
