Has anybody read any well though out, cogently argued and evidentially<br>
supported theories as to why technology, commerce, exploration, science,<br>
etc. developed in the West (and East) whilst the African sub-continent<br>
remained isolated and communites there relied on gatherer-hunter activities<br>
and basic agriculture?<br>
<p>
I'm sure I read somewhere that the Christian concept of God had a lot to do<br>
with it, since it includes the concept of free agency of the individual: a<br>
freedom for self-achievement which is itself a form of worship. But then,<br>
the Chinese invented gunpowder, etc. without Christianity. Equally, the<br>
civilizations of the Roman and Greek empires were founded before Christianity.<br>
<p>
It strikes me that the rapid pace of Western development must have had a<br>
certain spark, and that once it started it snowballed (from spark to<br>
snowball, hmmm). So why didn't that spark occur in Africa, or amongst<br>
tribes in Indonesia, etc.<br>
<p>
I want to try to get a grasp on this issue, because it seems so similar to<br>
the one we face now, as Extropians. What is it that sparks us to desire<br>
technological progression, whilst others are happy with the status quo, or<br>
fearful of development?<br>
