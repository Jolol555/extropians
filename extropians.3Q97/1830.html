Yes, but nature has done some optimizing. Along an unmyelinated axon<br>
the signal is sent by ion channels opening and closing, creating an<br>
electrochemical signal which moves fairly slowly. But if you<br>
myelinate the axon, the signal can move as a purely electrical signal<br>
(a change in trans-membrane potential) much faster, although it<br>
decays exponentially. So most axons are covered with myelin except<br>
at the nodes of Ravnier, where there are short stretches of<br>
unmyelinated surface. The result is that signals "jump" from one node<br>
to the other, and are amplified there so that they can reach the<br>
next. Still limited, but faster. <br>

<p>
Yes, there are such results. There was an article in Physics Review<br>
(I think) about connecting a neuron to a field effect transistor. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At anyrate.  Imagine this:  Using a micro-robot "surgeon" attach a fiber (as</i><br>
<i>&gt; in "fiber optic") to a nerve near the top of the spinal column....then</i><br>
<i>&gt; parallel that nerve along the spinal cord (thru the arms, legs...whatever)</i><br>
<i>&gt; until it reaches it's destination...then tie in again.  In effect cutting out</i><br>
<i>&gt; several feet (possibly) of slow electro-chemical nerve impulse transference</i><br>
<i>&gt; and replaceing it with light-speed.  Does this suggest anything about</i><br>
<i>&gt; increasing reflex time?  Or more prosaicly,,,repairing spinal cord injury?</i><br>
<p>
There is plenty of processing in the spinal cord (in the H-shaped<br>
grey matter column along its length) which you would need to replace,<br>
but your approach would work for much of the peripheral nerves. The<br>
big problem is that our muscles are fairly slow too, so even if you<br>
win a tenth of a second, the muscle speed would limit the use. But it<br>
might be very useful for perception?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But why stop there.  Many of my favorite  SF stories and novels use the</i><br>
<i>&gt; device of a direct neural interface (David Weber-"Imperial Implants", Daniel</i><br>
<i>&gt; Keys Moran-"Inskin", ...to name but two) to directly control mechanisms or</i><br>
<i>&gt; communications.  Is this not possible now?  At least in theory?</i><br>
<p>
At least in theory it is possible. The big problem is doing something<br>
useful with the connection, the brain is very "disorganized" (rather,<br>
organized in a complex and individual way). <br>
