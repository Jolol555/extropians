In a message dated 97-08-25 11:28:26 EDT, you write:<br>

<i> &gt; Interestingly, I was watching a documentary about Jupiter recently where</i><br>
<i> &gt; Gene Shoemaker (I think) was claiming that without a large gas giant in</i><br>
<i> &gt; the system to 'hoover up' comets events like the dinosaur extinction would</i><br>
<i> &gt; be so common that sentient life could not have evolved on Earth. If true,</i><br>
<i> &gt; this could be another reason why life seems so rare in the universe. </i><br>
<p>
And Anders replys<br>
 <br>
 I don't think that explanation holds; gas giants seem to be very<br>
 common. Most solar system models seems to predict them in the outer<br>
 solar system, and the few planets we have discovered outside the<br>
 solar system are (almost by definition due to our measurement<br>
 methods) gas giants. <br>

<p>
To which I add my nickle's worth:<br>
<p>
It might even be completey wrong...in fact if the idea's behind the<br>
"Kirkwood" zones are correct then the presence of a gas giant such as jupiter<br>
puts earth more at risk..not less.<br>
