I may have misunderstood you.  I thought you were talking about the computer<br>
industry as a whole, hardware+software.<br>
<p>
'Better' is up to the buyers of the software to decide.  <br>
<p>
But anyway, advances in hardware do drive advances in software,<br>
particularly in games.  Obviously, the more the hardware can do, the more<br>
software designers will exploit it (if they think they can make money<br>
doing so).<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;I''ve got no more than an ordinary end-users smattering of knowledge of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;computers, but it seems to me that despite its faults, Win95 is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;definite advance on Win 3.1 in terms of ease of use, speed of running</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;programs, and multitasking capability.  I *have* spent the occasional</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;day or two tearing my hair out over some problem, but then I expected</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;that when I got a computer, because the need for </i><br>
<i>&gt;backwards-compatibility</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and the many different manufacturers of ever snazzier hardware and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;software having slightly different standards means that there will *</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;always* be problems.  In fact come to think of it, most of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;complaints of the kind you make seem to forget that a lot of the reason</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;for Win95's 'bloatedness' is caused by these things, plus the </i><br>
<i>&gt;requirement</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;that the PC ought to be operatable by even relatively stupid people. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;This last requirement is never quite fulfillable, of course, precisely</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;because it requires a bloated, complex program that is prone to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;occasional problem! :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I've been using both Windows and Mac-Based platforms for years.  During </i><br>
<i>&gt;a 2 month period my company kept track of productivity comparisions </i><br>
<i>&gt;between the two platforms.  The results were devastating to the Wintel </i><br>
<i>&gt;Platform - every time a Mac crashed, the Wintel equivalent crashed 6 </i><br>
<i>&gt;times!</i><br>
<p>
Isn't that more to do with the hardware side?  In that Macs are designed<br>
as a whole?  But perhaps we should stop this computer talk, as it's<br>
constantly being done to death on just about every newsgroup and mailing<br>
list! :-)<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;A piss test for taking a job is the employer's privilege.  That is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;completely different from govt., because the govt. in no way *owns* the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;country.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm not sure I quite follow you here.  The government *owns* the country </i><br>
<i>&gt;in all sorts of ways.</i><br>
<p>
Living in a country isn't like having a job.  The government may own<br>
bits of land, but it isn't the owner of the right to live in that<br>
country in the same way as the company is the owner of the right to say<br>
who shall and shall not work for it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Also, the bigger operator is still losing money if s/he undercuts; the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;bigger s/he is the more money they lose, so in the *long run*, such</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;monopolies are unsustainable.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Please see my previos post in this regard.  Rockefeller only lowered </i><br>
<i>&gt;prices on gas where he was opening new stations.  This hardly put a dent </i><br>
<i>&gt;in his pocket.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
See posts now coming from others on this, esp John Clark's re. the<br>
economics of it.  I remember reading a few contemporary quotes somewhere<br>
<i>&gt;from some of the people who exploited this tactic of Rockefeller's to</i><br>
make money themselves that were quite funny.<br>
<p>
But my point stands: that sort of thing may be morally wrong, nasty, etc.,<br>
but it's not coercion, and it doesn't stop progress as a whole (not as<br>
much as coercive government measures to stop it do - precisely because<br>
they are coercive and unjust in the strict sense).<br>
