     Why apologize for a sense of metaphor?  You might rather be applauded.<br>

     Bravo, Natasha.  The light year thing didn't jump out at me until I <br>
     saw the subsequent correction and then hardly gave it a thought (of <br>
     course, I am conceptual not detail-oriented and a writer/artist).  In <br>
     this group, I suspect, technical accuracy, like cleanliness, is next <br>
     to whatever-you-substitute-for godliness. &lt;G&gt;  Too bad that comes <br>
     along with what appears to be a compulsion to correct.  Hope your mail <br>
     program has some auto-block rules.<br>
     <br>
     I share your awe about the Martian mission and hope it expands us as a <br>
     civilization, however near or far away it is.<br>
