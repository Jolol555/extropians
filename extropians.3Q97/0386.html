<p>
What is so unique about Cydonia? Geologically it is a mixture of fractured,<br>
desert plains containing numerous mesas (flat-topped eroded prominences)<br>
with varied craters typical of natural landforms throughout the solar<br>
system. But at latitude 41 degrees North, longitude 9 West lie a collection<br>
of features which some observers believe are anything but natural. Research<br>
conducted by a small group of scientists in America since 1979 has<br>
suggested a most exciting possibility - the remains of artificially<br>
designed structures.<br>
<p>
Mankind's last wholly successful voyage to Mars was NASA's robotic Viking<br>
mission in 1976. Twin orbiters and landers investigated the geology,<br>
chemistry, meteorology and possible biology of the Red planet. Whilst soil<br>
chemistry tests were ambiguous, more than 50,000 digital images of Martian<br>
geomorphology were returned from orbit. Most of the planet has now been<br>
mapped to a resolution of 100m, and, in some places, 10m. Scientists<br>
continue to analyse these pictures, inferring details of geological,<br>
climatological and - most controversially - biological evolution from them.<br>
<p>
There is ample evidence that the Martian climate was in the past more<br>
benign than today. Eroded river channels, evidence of glaciation and<br>
perhaps even ancient lake and sea beds have all been seen in Viking images.<br>
An ocean may have occupied most of the northern hemisphere. There has been<br>
speculation that the features at Cydonia lie on the edge of this ancient<br>
northern sea. Certainly if the Cydonia remains are artificial, proximity to<br>
water would be expected. Water and oxygen may have existed in the area<br>
abundantly over one billion years ago.<br>
<p>
Photographic interpretation plays a key role in generating hypotheses<br>
concerning Mars's past evolutionary history. Ejecta blankets, comprised of<br>
material thrown out by meteorite impacts - and with icy flows surrounding<br>
their craters - hint at locations with ice or permafrost beneath. The width<br>
of ancient valleys can be gauged from 3- dimensional maps (generated from<br>
originally 2-D images) and the volume of floodwaters which once occupied<br>
them estimated. The heights of volcanoes and depths of canyons can also be<br>
shown in startling detail in computer flyby simulations. This kind of<br>
research is the province of planetary geologists and geomorphologists.<br>
<p>
Similar techniques - shape-from-shading (computerised 3-D image generation<br>
from shadow depth) and stereoscopic imaging (generated by overlaying two<br>
images of the same area taken from slightly different perspectives) - have<br>
also been applied to Cydonia. New interpretative tools like fractal<br>
analysis, used to determine the probabilities of non-natural features<br>
occurring in a landscape, have also been brought to bear. Fractal analysis<br>
highlights any possibly artificial objects due to their non-fractal nature<br>
(i.e. they stand out by having a different mathematical signature from the<br>
background terrain). When the technique was tested on Viking imagery, the<br>
results suggested certain features were strongly non-fractal, and thus by<br>
implication, non-natural.<br>
<p>
Those studying the Cydonia region have identified a number of objects which<br>
appear to share certain architectural, artistic and archaeological<br>
characteristics not intrinsic to geomorphological formations. The most<br>
obvious formation was termed the Face because of its similarity to one. The<br>
DiPietro and Molenaar (D&amp;M) pyramid and City are also terms frequently used<br>
when nearby landforms are described. These names are used solely for<br>
research purposes and do not ascribe any function to the objects under<br>
investigation.<br>
<p>
Discovered by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)<br>
personnel in July 1976, the Face was originally dismissed as a "trick of<br>
light and shadow" when shown to journalists at the Jet Propulsion<br>
Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. Project scientists claimed that<br>
later images of Cydonia revealed nothing.<br>
<p>
The Face was rediscovered in 1979 by Vincent DiPietro and Gregory Molenaar,<br>
computer engineers under contract at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center,<br>
Maryland. DiPietro had become intrigued with Viking frame 35A72 labelled<br>
"Head" filed in the archive. Looking for further information on the<br>
geological explanation and analysis of the feature, he found nothing.<br>
Initially DiPietro and his partner Molenaar called for further<br>
investigation of the 2.5km wide Face and the apparently vast pyramid-like<br>
structure - approximately 500m high and nearly 3km long - on frame 70A13<br>
nearby, later termed the D&amp;M pyramid after its discoverers.<br>
<p>
They first developed a computer processing method called SPIT (Starburst<br>
Pixel Interleave Technique) to enhance the images, then tested the<br>
integrity of the method on Landsat photographs of the Earth. Although they<br>
presented their findings in a technically responsible and scientific<br>
manner, calling for verification of their results, they were generally<br>
ignored by the very scientists who should have been most interested.<br>
<p>
Despite having been shunned by the mainstream planetary establishment,<br>
undaunted, they set up their own research organisation Mars Research, with<br>
physicist Dr John Brandenburg.<br>
<p>
DiPietro and Molenaar's findings were further developed by the pioneering<br>
work of former NASA consultant Richard Hoagland in the early 1980s.<br>
Hoagland was one of the men behind the interstellar plaques - designed to<br>
be understood by any alien life-forms who might discover them - aboard the<br>
Pioneer 10 and 11 probes to Jupiter, Saturn and beyond. An extremely<br>
controversial figure in the US space community, he promotes radical new<br>
ideas many find difficult to accept. With a background in subject areas<br>
like archaeoastronomy, Hoagland was also something of an outsider to the<br>
planetary establishment. He had originally accepted NASA's explanation of<br>
the Face without question.<br>
<p>
Hoagland discovered a collection of pyramidal mounds to the southwest of<br>
the Face (termed the City) and containing the Fort, an unusual object<br>
apparently with straight walls and an open central area. He also calculated<br>
that Martian solstice alignments at Cydonia would be fulfilled every<br>
500,000 years or so, later revising this to 330,000 years. Departing from<br>
the usual planetary landform analysis techniques, he examined the features'<br>
possible spatial orientations to one another. He also commissioned sculptor<br>
Kynthia Lynne to create an analogue clay model of the Face and surrounding<br>
terrain. When compared with the independent computer studies conducted<br>
there was strong correlation. Part of Kynthia's model can be seen on the<br>
cover of Hoagland's book "The Monuments of Mars".<br>
<p>
Results of the early work on Cydonia are found in anthropologist Randolfo<br>
Pozos's book "The Face on Mars: Evidence for a Lost Civilization?", an<br>
account of the computerised conference that took place in late 1983 and<br>
early 1984 between Hoagland, DiPietro, Molenaar, Brandenburg and others. As<br>
well as exploring the technical research conducted on Viking image mosaics,<br>
Pozos approached the highly speculative subject of extraterrestrial life<br>
from religious and philosophical perspectives, examining the profound<br>
implications should Mars indeed have once held advanced life.<br>
<p>
The next researcher to address Cydonia was Dr Mark Carlotto, former<br>
employee of a Boston company occasionally involved in US government-related<br>
work. Dr Carlotto examined Viking imagery in 1986/7 using<br>
shape-from-shading, disproving the "trick of light and shadow" theory. He<br>
noted the possibility that teeth were present in the mouth of the Face, and<br>
that these were not artifacts of imaging, appearing in pictures taken at<br>
two different sun angles. Estimating the Face at around 2.5km long, 2km<br>
wide and 400m in height, Carlotto further noted crossed symmetrical lines<br>
on the forehead. He also applied the fractal analysis technique two years<br>
later. In 1991 Carlotto published a book about his work "The Martian<br>
Enigmas", where he called for Mars Observer, NASA's most recent Mars probe,<br>
to re-image Cydonia.<br>
<p>
In 1988 Erol Torun, a geomorphologist and cartographer with the US Defence<br>
Mapping Agency in Washington DC, published a cartographic and geometrical<br>
analysis of the D&amp;M pyramid. He concluded that the internal angles and<br>
symmetry were unlikely to occur in a natural mountain, and that no known<br>
erosional process could produce such a regular formation. Torun has also<br>
worked with Hoagland developing his theories. Finally former planetologist<br>
and NASA astronaut corps member Brian O'Leary (at one time on the selection<br>
list for a manned mission to Mars) also published work on Cydonia in 1990,<br>
independently reviewing Carlotto's work in the Journal of the British<br>
Interplanetary Society.<br>
<p>
The history of the Cydonia research - and NASA's attitude towards it, up to<br>
and including the loss of the Mars Observer spacecraft in August 1993 - are<br>
well documented in the 200 page McDaniel Report. Author Stanley McDaniel,<br>
Philosophy Professor Emeritus at Sonoma State University, California,<br>
details how NASA failed to seriously consider the research and potential<br>
importance of the issues raised.<br>
<p>
McDaniel argues that the space agency ignored or avoided the research,<br>
failing to justify its criticisms. The narrow SETI (Search for<br>
Extraterrestrial Intelligence) methodology assumed and adopted by NASA was<br>
the radio-search model - i.e. evidence of extraterrestrial life could only<br>
occur via Earth-based radiotelescopes. Yet surely it is incontestable that<br>
potential artifacts on nearby planets need a clearer photographic<br>
examination? In view of this point, it seems strange NASA is unwilling to<br>
consider it, though there have been recent signs that this attitude may be<br>
changing.<br>
<p>
The most recent work on Cydonia was completed in 1995 by Professor McDaniel<br>
and Dr Horace Crater, of the University of Tennessee Space Institute. They<br>
published a mathematical analysis of the small mounds in the vicinity of<br>
the Face and City, their method being to discount the random placing of<br>
these mounds.<br>
<p>
If the objects in Cydonia are artificial how could we learn more about<br>
them, beyond obviously re-imaging the area with optical sensor systems? One<br>
approach might be to use a technique known as radar remote sensing. This<br>
was used with great success on NASA's Magellan mission, which recently<br>
mapped Venus using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Radar remote sensing has<br>
a number of advantages over conventional optical systems. Firstly, the<br>
illumination of a scene is generated by the satellite itself, in the form<br>
of microwaves. These have several unique properties: they can pass through<br>
clouds and weather systems unaffected; they can be used regardless of day<br>
or night (and hence are of great interest to the military) and can, to some<br>
extent, help to show what surface textures and materials are composed of.<br>
On Earth for example, power lines and railways show up clearly on radar<br>
imagery, being linear metal features they are strong signal reflectors.<br>
<p>
A radar system deployed to study Cydonia might be used not only to map the<br>
topography, but also provide spectacular 3-D views similar to those of<br>
Venus generated from Magellan data. It would also be able to peer beneath<br>
the Martian desert revealing the geological substructure as well as any<br>
possible ruins.<br>
<p>
The European Space Agency has examined instrumentation - including several<br>
radar systems - for possible Mars missions in a 1989 study document. Radar<br>
applications on Earth have made some surprising findings. The space shuttle<br>
radar revealed ancient Mayan canals when the shuttle flew over Central<br>
America in 1981. Completely covered in jungle they were invisible from the<br>
ground. Archaeologists subsequently visited the site and verified the<br>
shuttle's discoveries. The discovery of the ancient city of Ubar, in the<br>
Middle East, was also assisted by space shuttle radar imagery. At the time<br>
of writing, Dr Michael Malin, President of Malin Space Sciences - the<br>
company building the camera for Mars Observer's replacement - has said he<br>
will re- image Cydonia. This marks a subtle change from an individual who<br>
has sole control of what objects the camera photographs, and originally<br>
showed no special interest in the Cydonia region. The Mars Global Surveyor<br>
is due to commence mapping Mars in early 1998.<br>
<p>
What could be the solution to the mystery of Cydonia? Conventional<br>
explanations for the Face involve natural forces blindly sculpting the mesa<br>
into its near-symmetrical form. The pyramids have been compared with<br>
driekanters or ventifacts - rocks and stones polished and faceted by<br>
windblown sand. Yet if the landforms are natural it obviously asks a great<br>
deal of nature. How could the same winds produce such differing forms so<br>
close by, and what about the precise mathematical angles claimed in the D&amp;M<br>
pyramid?<br>
<p>
We can but speculate on the implications should the features turn out to be<br>
artificial, but theories put forward amongst those advocating an artificial<br>
origin suggest that Cydonia might provide evidence for it; for example:<br>
<p>
1.An ancient indigenous civilization which arose on Mars billions of years<br>
ago, when the planet was more Earth-like; perishing, for reasons not yet<br>
fully understood, when the climate changed.<br>
<p>
2.Visitors from beyond the solar system who colonized Mars when it was more<br>
habitable, either dying out, migrating to Earth or returning home when the<br>
climate changed.<br>
<p>
Or do the Martian artifacts really seem so unfamiliar?<br>
<p>
Why assume they are really so ancient?<br>
<p>
Could the real answer to the mystery of Cydonia have something to do with<br>
us?..<br>
<p>
....and, with this I believe we can now discuss this region without the<br>
burden of psuedo-scientists attempting to wish a history and background<br>
that may, or may not exist.<br>
<p>
Cydonia is not going away! It has been around for a long, long time and<br>
there is no reason to believe it is going to disappear in the next week,<br>
month or year. I am simply not certain at this time, that anything other<br>
than natural formations of land structures through natural erosion took<br>
place.<br>
<p>
Imaging will occur over this region once the Mars Surveyor arrives. It may<br>
take some time; the first images may not be from the high-res imager, but;<br>
if there are real scientifically 'provable' artificial structures as<br>
proposed by those mentioned above, you can well bet that NASA/JPL WILL<br>
obtain the best images possible. And, if there was any real scientific<br>
proof of unnatural 'artificial' structures in the Cydonia region today you<br>
can well bet NASA/JPL would place it on its highest priority. There is<br>
simply no proof. Scientists can not avoid a true mystery, they can avoid<br>
one that is obviously false.<br>
<p>
Perhaps NASA/JPL are doing what scientists should do and that is to better<br>
understand how Mars came to be what it is today. With a clearer<br>
understanding of Mars and its geological history then perhaps we will be<br>
better suited to explore the anomalies associated with the Cydonia region.<br>
