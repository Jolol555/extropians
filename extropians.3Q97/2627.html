<p>
This sounds likely in a few years if not a few months.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can pay some, or many women</i><br>

<p>
No doubt.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [Dying of cancer]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  But, say I were able to track down one of those 20 year old clones growing up</i><br>
<i>&gt; in South America.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   All a brain really needs to keep functioning is a good blood supply?  Surely</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is within today's surgical technique to be able to route a few of my son's</i><br>
<i>&gt; arteries to those going to my brain?  Nerve grafts don't sound as easy, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; really aren't necessary.  I would be willing to keep my brain activity going,</i><br>
<i>&gt; albeit in some monstous pit of hell without senses, to be able to hold out</i><br>
<i>&gt; another 50 years until a cure for my disease or a new host can be found.</i><br>
<p>
Of course we don't know what would happen to a brain if you cut off all<br>
external nerves for 50 years, but kept it supplied with blood.  It's easy<br>
to assume that total insanity would result, but we really don't know.<br>
Conceivably you might fall into a coma and remain unchanged after a<br>
short while.  The real question from your point of view is whether the<br>
memories and personality could be preserved or restored.  Certainly the<br>
odds would be better than with death and burial, but it's not clear how<br>
they would compare with cryonics.<br>
<p>
Actually if you're going to transplant the whole head, presumably you<br>
could keep your eyes, ears, nose and mouth active.  You could even<br>
speak using mechanical assistance.  So you don't have to assume that<br>
you'll be without senses.  It could be a life not much worse than a<br>
paraplegic today.<br>
<p>
The procedure would require some considerable reconfiguration of your<br>
son's circulatory system.  As I recall, the head uses a surprisingly<br>
high percentage of the fuel/oxygen consumption of your body.  So the<br>
circulatory system alterations would not necessarily be trivial.<br>
<p>
Brain tissue ages just like any other; your neurons will suffer decreased<br>
functionality, gunk building up, DNA damage, etc.  The circulatory system<br>
and other tissues may fail as well.  So just keeping a good blood supply<br>
won't guarantee metabolic survival.  You may also be more vulnerable to<br>
misfortune or even attack as a head stuck on someone else's shoulders<br>
than you would as a suspendee deep in a vault full of liquid nitrogen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I</i><br>
<i>&gt; imagine it as a sort of Zaphod-Beeblebrox arrangement, but my head would</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably be hanging limp while my son's head appeared normal.  As long as I</i><br>
<i>&gt; wasn't dying from a brain disease, my son's blood, et al should keep me alive</i><br>
<i>&gt; without worries of rejection, etc.  Although, might my cancer be contagious to</i><br>
<i>&gt; a clone?</i><br>
<p>
If the cancer has metastasized, it is conceivable that some cells might be<br>
lodged within your head, and could eventually float into your son's body.<br>
Perhaps he could undergo some chemotherapy to help prevent this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   OK, so assuming the the medical technique is practical, what will it take to</i><br>
<i>&gt; get my son to agree to the surgery?  We would be family, but a monetary</i><br>
<i>&gt; incentive might be necessary.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, especially if he's been raised remotely, I would assume that he would<br>
require some compensation to carry your limp head around on his shoulders<br>
for 50 years.  It hardly sounds like an attractive proposition from his<br>
POV.  If you are wealthy enough, though, probably almost anything could be<br>
arranged.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What about the legal issues involved here?  What</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be a good nation for my son to have citizenship in?  (yes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; diversification would be a good idea).</i><br>
<p>
Legally, there seem to be two issues.  One is whether your son is truly<br>
consenting to the procedure.  Let's suppose that can be dealt with.  Then<br>
there may be general ethical prohibitions by society which prevent this<br>
kind of "unnatural" treatment.  For that purpose you'd want a country<br>
which is open-minded about this kind of thing.  Perhaps Russia, with its<br>
atheistic background, will evolve into an anything-goes society in the<br>
next few years.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What about if I made a clone of myself,</i><br>
<i>&gt; made it sign a contract, then gave it a lobotomy so it couldn't back out?</i><br>
<p>
Giving your clone a lobotomy without its permission would be illegal,<br>
and wrong.  I think you will do better to stick to consensual arrangements.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Screw ethics when its my longevity at stake.</i><br>
<p>
Ethics can represent rules of thumb for success.  The better ethical<br>
grounds you can find for your arrangements, the more likely you are to<br>
carry them off.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Anybody know of any good cloning labs?</i><br>
<p>
The Raelian movement is a religious cult which has embraced the idea of<br>
human cloning.  You might contact them and see whether they have done<br>
anything to implement their plans.<br>
