the<br>

<i>&gt;First of all, my initial post never cited the above text. I merely said,</i><br>

<i>&gt;At the very least, I'm glad you found it interesting, if not amenable to</i><br>

<p>
Very sorry about that. There's a nasty "feature" in my email program that <br>
makes it too easy to send out incomplete messages that have been saved to <br>
disk. I skimmed the article on e-prime and grabbed this quote from it. I <br>
intended to write a longer essay, but got sidetracked.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Hmm... seems to me that the whole purpose of learning is to "immediately</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; produce high order abstractions". Are you against forming high order</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; abstractions?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, I agree that accurate meta-level abstractions are an important part</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the learning process, not to mention the creative process. But, if</i><br>
<i>&gt;they're inaccurate, I can't see how that helps you learn concrete facts,</i><br>
<i>&gt;unless you ask someone about it and then they give you the correct</i><br>
<i>&gt;answer. That of course assumes that there's someone around teaching you</i><br>
<i>&gt;all the time. Regardless, premature judgements seem to be a bad thing</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the most part. I can't say much more than that other than that what</i><br>
<i>&gt;I originally wrote was: </i><br>
<p>
I would venture that the formation of higher-order (meta-level) <br>
abstractions is the *purpose* of learning. I'm curious to hear your <br>
definition of learning, and how it doesn't involve the use of high-order <br>
abstrations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But, if</i><br>
<i>&gt;they're inaccurate, I can't see how that helps you learn concrete facts,</i><br>
<i>&gt;unless you ask someone about it and then they give you the correct</i><br>
<i>&gt;answer.</i><br>
<p>
Wait a second - who said high-level abstractions are inaccurate? Is that <br>
a given?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I must plead E-Prime on this one. To ask what man *is* suggests that man</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; does not *become*. Knowing one's nature and the nature of the universe</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in which one exists is IMO the ultimate goal. If I can finally know what</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I *am*, then I have stopped evolving. Since time doesn't stand still for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; me, I become incorrect about what I *am* only a millisecond later.</i><br>
<p>
What does "pleading E-Prime" mean? How does asking "What is man?" suggest <br>
that "Man does not become." What is becoming, and how does man do it? Why <br>
does one stop evolving if one learns more about one's self? I don't mean <br>
to badger you, but I can't understand this paragraph well enough to judge <br>
if I agree with it or not.<br>
