Hardly. Just read any book about theology and you will find even<br>
worse concepts. <br>
<p>

I might have been too cursory, but that website didn't convince me<br>
the least about neo-tech. In fact, it almost looked like a SubGenius<br>
parody of extropianism; a lot of rants against mysticism, the IRS<br>
and the current irrationalism interspersed with promises for immortality,<br>
prosperity and romantic love. There appeared to be some good ideas <br>
in the texts, but I tend to get sceptical of people who spend more<br>
time denouncing their detractors than actually getting to the point. <br>
<p>
For example, the secret of neo-tech immortality turned out to be<br>
that we should remove our deathist memes and other irrationalisms,<br>
create a free high-tech society, and then do the necessary research.<br>
The section about physics was filled with grand claims but no<br>
equations, stringent derivations or actual experiments. Finally,<br>
suggesting the book "Poker: a Guaranteed Income for Life" as a <br>
precursor for Neo-Tech didn't exactly improve its image. <br>
<p>
So, does neo-tech have anything to contribute except loud claims?<br>
