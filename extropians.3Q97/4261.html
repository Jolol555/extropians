I think this is a fine time to re-advertise my filter service.  It's a<br>
mostly daily digest of the extropians list, consisting of whatever posts<br>
I feel are worth reading by people with less time than I have and my<br>
tastes.  The process is assisted and biased by a filter program which<br>
selects out various people -- Anders Sandberg, Damien Broderick, Greg<br>
Burch, Robin Hanson, Jay Freeman, Max More, Hal Finney, Eric Watt<br>
Forste, Curt Adams, and others.<br>
<p>
Replying to that list simply sends mail to me; you still send mail to<br>
extropians to post.  It's not a separate discussion group -- and given<br>
that the recipients can't even respond to a test-request without<br>
individual attention, I don't think it's going to become one.  Just a<br>
one-way filtered digest.<br>

E-mail select-request@ugcs.caltech.edu to subscribe.<br>

It struck me last night that my list is rather conservative, at least<br>
compared with Rapture of the Future/Anarchy Now!/Singularity Rulez<br>
people.  In the mainstream sophisticates are known for entertaining <br>
new ideas; in radical environs they keep old ones...<br>

"No, life is not fair.  Not intrinsically.  It's something we can try to<br>
make it, though.  A goal we can aim for.  You can choose to do so, or<br>
not.  We have.  I'm sorry you find us so repulsive for that."<br>
