My innocent, tragic, love affair at 13<br>
<p>
<p>
Tony Allen-Mills recollects an adolescent affair with his music mistress<br>
 -- a young woman whose career he inadvertently ruined.<br>
#<br>
<p>
I was visiting a school friend on a Sussex farm when the telephone call<br>
that ended my childhood arrived on a cool spring morning 30 years ago. I<br>
can still feel today the sense of impending dread that a seemingly<br>
innocuous message aroused. My father was coming to collect me. There was<br>
something about a visiting aunt.<br>
<p>
I knew at once that disaster was imminent. No aunt had been mentioned<br>
when I had left our home in Hastings only a couple of hours earlier. The<br>
thunderous look on my father's face as he stepped from his car, and as<br>
he struggled to maintain his composure in front of my friend's mother,<br>
left no doubt that my secret was out.<br>
<p>
As we drove away from the farm he seethed for a while in silence. Then<br>
he turned to me, his greying moustache quivering with rage.<br>
<p>
"You know what this is about, don't you?" he snapped.<br>
<p>
"Um," I replied.<br>
<p>
"What have you been doing with that woman? How long has this been going<br>
on? Do you realise this has destroyed your mother?"<br>
<p>
I could do nothing but sob. I was 13 years old. For much of the previous<br>
four months I had been recklessly, deliriously besotted with the music<br>
mistress at my preparatory boarding school. She was 23, and I adored<br>
her. We had slept together at least 20 times.<br>
<p>
Oh, the thrill of those late-night excursions along silent school<br>
corridors from my dormitory to her room. And the terror of that dreadful<br>
morning when we woke up to find the rest of the school already at<br>
breakfast. I had to sneak to the nearby matron's office, heart pounding,<br>
feigning illness, to explain my absence from the prefects' table.<br>
<p>
At home during the Easter holidays, I had kept her photograph hidden<br>
beneath the lining of one of my bedroom drawers, along with a poem and<br>
several letters she had written to me at school. These my father had now<br>
discovered.<br>
<p>
The memories came flooding back last week when I read of Tracey Whalin,<br>
who ran away to Florida with a 14-year-old. In America she was charged<br>
with "lewd and indecent assault on a child". And I suppose there is<br>
something lewd and indecent about an adult woman seducing a boy so<br>
young. It is probably worse when the adult is a teacher and the boy is<br>
one of her pupils.<br>
<p>
Yet that is not how I remember Sylvia A, the lonely, immature music<br>
teacher stuck on an isolated school estate in the middle of the Sussex<br>
countryside with 100 small boys and several elderly bachelor teachers<br>
for company. Not for a moment in the past 30 years have I ever<br>
considered her lewd or indecent -- and I am now myself a parent acutely<br>
concerned about the upbringing of my two daughters.<br>
<p>
My anger is instead reserved for those teachers -- and, yes, my father,<br>
too -- whose anxiety to cover up a potentially embarrassing incident<br>
left me hurt and bewildered for much of the rest of my youth. Whatever else<br>
happens to Whalin's young friend, I hope he isn't treated as an evil<br>
little brat.<br>
<p>
There's something else I should mention. Sylvia didn't seduce me. I set<br>
out to seduce Sylvia.<br>
<p>
Our story began at Vinehall school, converted from a sprawling<br>
19th-century mansion amid lovely grounds near Robertsbridge. My father<br>
was an army officer, and to secure me a stable education while he was<br>
posted around the world, he enrolled me as a  boarder, aged nine.<br>
<p>
I had the happiest of schooldays, spoilt only by a tyrannical Latin<br>
teacher who enjoyed wielding a gym shoe on bare bottoms. I was a keen<br>
football player, and it was my prowess as a centre forward  that may<br>
first have caught Sylvia's eye.<br>
<p>
She had come to the school a couple of terms earlier and had immediately<br>
cut a dash with her trendy clothes and cheerful manner. I still remember<br>
the stir she caused when she came down to breakfast one morning wearing<br>
the first red miniskirt ever to be seen on school grounds. The Latin<br>
master nearly choked on his porridge.<br>
<p>
At my mother's insistence I had signed up for piano lessons, and though<br>
I was tone deaf, no student was ever more attentive sitting next to Miss<br>
A on the piano stool, nor more sad to leave her at the end of the<br>
lesson. I flirted with her shamelessly. I considered the lesson a<br>
triumph if I managed to brush my thigh against hers.<br>
<p>
One Saturday afternoon Sylvia was on the touchline when I scored five<br>
goals against an opposing team. I was big and quick for my age and<br>
utterly selfish with the ball. At my next piano lesson, Miss A touched<br>
my cheek. "Well played," she said. "You were good."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From that moment I was in love. By the end of the Christmas term I was</i><br>
demanding a kiss for every goal I scored. In one of the season's last<br>
games, we won 7-2. I scored all seven goals. The headmaster thought I<br>
should turn professional. Little did he know I just wanted seven kisses.<br>
<p>
Three days before the end of term, I asked if I could come to her room.<br>
Sylvia blushed and looked away. Victory, I thought. She didn't say no.<br>
That night I crept from the dormitory where, as a senior prefect, I<br>
supervised a dozen younger boys. They were all asleep. I knocked on<br>
Sylvia's door. I barely heard her whisper: "Come in."<br>
<p>
Oddly, I remember nothing of the sex. There was none the first night -- <br>
merely industrious hugging. There were two more nights before the end of<br>
term. On both, we broke a number of laws. I stayed in her room a couple<br>
of hours, then sneaked back to my dormitory -- exhausted, elated,<br>
inspired.<br>
<p>
It therefore came as a considerable shock, on the first day of the<br>
Easter term, to find Sylvia repelling my advances. Evidently she had<br>
been greatly sobered over the Christmas break. She must have been<br>
bitterly regretting her weakness the previous term. As for me, I<br>
couldn't understand her. I had spent the entire Christmas holiday<br>
longing to get back to school; longing to get back to her bed. Now she<br>
wouldn't even look at me.<br>
<p>
Slowly I broke her down. Boarding school terms are long, and there was<br>
little at Vinehall to distract a pretty and sociable young music<br>
mistress. There was no town within walking distance. She couldn't afford<br>
her own car. She had a boyfriend in London, but she had to work at the<br>
school most weekends and she only saw him about once a month. Eventually<br>
Sylvia relented. I got my next kiss without even having to score a goal<br>
-- which was just as well, as Easter was the rugby term and rugby was<br>
never my forte.<br>
<p>
The point here, I suppose, is that Sylvia was scarcely a lewd and<br>
indecent woman seeking out sordid sexual gratification. She must have<br>
been desperately confused. She knew that what she was doing was wrong,<br>
yet misery and isolation must have propelled her to bow to the insistent<br>
flattery of a dangerously knowing schoolboy. I have no idea what<br>
happened in the Whalin case, but it would be far from safe to assume<br>
that teenage boys are sexually  innocent.<br>
<p>
It was just after the resumption of our affair -- with further nocturnal<br>
excursions along that creaking corridor -- that my father returned from<br>
an 18-month posting to Borneo. He came to watch me play rugby. I didn't<br>
know it at the time, but he was shocked by my haggard appearance. I must<br>
have been pale from lack of sleep.<br>
<p>
He hadn't seen me during his long absence, so perhaps he was more<br>
attuned than my mother to changes in my behaviour. No sooner had I left<br>
the house at the beginning of the Easter holiday than he was rummaging<br>
through my room for evidence. Like a fool, I had left plenty to find.<br>
<p>
I have no way of knowing exactly what happened next, but it is now clear<br>
to me that an agreement was reached to keep the matter out of the<br>
newspapers. Sylvia was dismissed on the spot and I have never seen or<br>
heard of her since. As for my future, everything depended on one man.<br>
John Kendall-Carpenter, a former England rugby union international, was<br>
headmaster of my father's alma mater, Cranbrook school in Kent. I had<br>
been due to move to Cranbrook at the start of the next school year.<br>
Would Kendall-Carpenter agree to accept me a term early under such<br>
sordid circumstances?<br>
<p>
Eventually a deal was struck. I would be removed from Vinehall. Nobody<br>
would ever say I had been expelled. I would simply turn up at Cranbrook<br>
a term early. Teachers would be advised it was for  family reasons -- my<br>
father was moving from Borneo to Malaysia. My father took me aside,<br>
clasped me by the shoulders, and told me, not without sympathy: "You<br>
have been given a chance. You must never speak of this to anyone."<br>
<p>
And that should have been that. Except for the fact that, in all this<br>
convenient deal-making, nobody ever sought to ask me if I had any<br>
questions, if I was worried about anything, or if I was happy with the<br>
way things worked out. (Of course I wasn't: I agonised about Sylvia for<br>
years and even tried pathetically to trace her. I remember spending one<br>
evening telephoning all the entries in the London directory with her<br>
fairly common last name. I would listen for a few seconds to see if I<br>
recognised her voice; then I would hang up without speaking. I have<br>
never found her.)<br>
<p>
As long as my father was alive, we never discussed the matter again. Nor<br>
did I wish to wound my mother further by keeping the subject alive. And<br>
the last person concerned about my feelings was Kendall-Carpenter, who<br>
viewed me from the start with deadly distaste.<br>
<p>
Kendall-Carpenter -- hailed later as a great educator -- made it clear to<br>
me that I had been admitted to Cranbrook on sufferance; that I had done<br>
something so hideously wrong that I was lucky not to be flogged within<br>
an inch of my life; and that no trouble from me would be tolerated.<br>
<p>
So I had to sort things out for myself, and for years after my affair<br>
with Sylvia, I must have been fairly intolerable. Somehow I knew enough<br>
not to boast about my conquest to my Cranbrook schoolmates -- I realised<br>
they would regard me either as a liar or a  freak. Yet it took me a long<br>
time to realise that I was not irresistible to women, and that a<br>
glorious adolescent romance with a sad and lonely music mistress was no<br>
guarantee of future sexual success. Now I come to think of it, I was a<br>
thoroughly repulsive 15-year-old.<br>
<p>
So I do not think that the authorities should be too harsh in these<br>
cases. The chances are that other teenager lovers will grow up, as I<br>
did, with indelible memories of what seemed, at least to me, a love<br>
affair of effortless purity. My main regret, of course, is that I helped<br>
ruin Sylvia's life. And to that charge, I can surely plead that I was<br>
too young to know any better.<br>
