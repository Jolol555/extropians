If you juxtapose a person now, and that "same" person 5 minutes from now,<br>
they will not be exactly the same.  If I use your definition of a person<br>
as "the behaviour of a chunk of matter", then these are two people are<br>
not the same, since I cannot expect you to behave exactly the same way in<br>
5 minutes as you do now.  I use the definition you cited last time: "I am<br>
my thoughts and emotions", then again these people are not the same since<br>
obviously their thoughts are not the same after a period of five minutes.<br>

<p>
Where does the boundary of your person end?  Or, to use your wording,<br>
what are the limits of your "chunk of matter"?  Does this chunk of<br>
matter include the E. Coli in your gut, the air in your lungs, the water<br>
vapor of perspiration coming off your skin?  Am I to hold you personally<br>
responsible for the behaviour of the E. Coli in your gut? <br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't see how position could be relevant to consciousness, the brain has no </i><br>
<i>&gt; way of detecting it's position, only senses can do that and they need not </i><br>
<i>&gt; come from the same place as the brain.</i><br>
              <br>
I think our debate is mostly because we are working on two separate<br>
projects.  Your project appears to be to define yourself to yourself.<br>
Defining yourself as your thoughts and emotions works well, if this is<br>
your project.  My project, on the other hand, is to create a universal<br>
definition of a person.  Obviously, your definition of a person is not<br>
useful for an outside observer.  I don't know what your thoughts are.  All<br>
I can observe is your current structure, and your history of structure and<br>
actions.  Maybe these two projects are immmiscible,  what do you think? <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;I agree that we are our thoughts, but the duplicate has had no         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;thoughts, only *memories* of thoughts.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But memories of thoughts is all you or I or copies or originals have. There </i><br>
<i>&gt; is no way to tell you were not created 5 minutes ago complete with memories </i><br>
<i>&gt; of being a child, and no reason to be concerned if you were. I think that </i><br>
<i>&gt; when you're talking about information, and that's what we are, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; distinction between copy and original becomes meaningless. Do you have my </i><br>
<i>&gt; original post or just an inferior copy? </i><br>
<p>
I assume I have the original post, but you never know... ;-)<br>
<p>
OK,<br>
<p>
Say I run a race, and I win, and the award ceremony is tomorrow.  Right<br>
after the race someone drugs me and makes a duplicate of me against my<br>
will and knowledge.  Now, I go to the ceremony, so does my duplicate, and<br>
the prize can only go one person(of course we are different people now<br>
since we have diverged at the point of duplication)  Who does the prize go<br>
to?  Now is the distinction between original and copy meaningless?<br>
<p>
(BTW, for the above question, the rules of the race permit no ties if the<br>
photo-finish has only one person crossing the finish line, so you can't<br>
cop out that way ;-) <br>
              <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;the original will theoretically still have some of the atoms that </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;participated in the chemical reactions that made those thoughts in </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;the first place.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How could that be relevant? Science can not tell one Hydrogen atom from  </i><br>
<i>&gt; another, good thing too because we constantly recycle our atoms, a year ago </i><br>
<i>&gt; your atoms were in plants and fish and birds and cows. </i><br>
              <br>
Ok, I concede, this is not relevant. ;)<br>
<p>
Let me try again...  If time was/is a navigatable dimension, and one<br>
navigated it backwards(sorry, why word choice is a bit poor, here), one<br>
would see that the duplicate has little or no history, while the original<br>
quite obviously does.  This is why I don't think you can hold the<br>
duplicate responsible for the actions of the original.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;If I somehow (another thought experiment) have the exact same thought         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;as you (I'm not sure how you'd go about measuring that) at exactly         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;the same time, are our two persons converging.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes.</i><br>
<p>
Whether I agree with it or not, this is a pretty cool concept, probably<br>
best exemplified by couples who wear matching jogging outfits ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;And if this continues, to the point where ALL our thoughts and         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;emotions are exactly the same, have we become one person?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Did I die?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Did you die? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;How can two people become one when both of them still exist?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because nothing has been lost. If I append your post and my post to the same  </i><br>
<i>&gt; text file both posts still exist but there is only one file.</i><br>
              <br>
I guess I agree, but I don't like your analogy.  In your post analogy, the<br>
two post are converging in location, not in structural similarity.  Maybe<br>
I just have a hard time seeing convergance in similarity as a full<br>
convergance.  There are still too things, even if they are the same in<br>
structure.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;To differentiate, I would again have to look at history of action</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know why I'm the way I am. Nobody consciously understands the </i><br>
<i>&gt; fantastically complicated history that in a universe billions of light years </i><br>
<i>&gt; across and billions of years old somehow brought one particular sperm and one </i><br>
<i>&gt; particular egg together at one particular instant, but consciousness is what</i><br>
<i>&gt; we're concerned with so I don't see how the mysterious history of how I got </i><br>
<i>&gt; to be the way I am could make the slightest difference to my  consciousness. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The only important thing is that I am the way I am.</i><br>
<p>
With this philosophy, I assume you judge a person by a clean-slate policy?<br>
Do you think people are not responsible for past actions because it<br>
doesn't matter how they got to be the way they are, it's just the way they<br>
are now?(that was awkwardly phrased, but I think you understand my<br>
point...) <br>
