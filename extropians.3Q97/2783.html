In fairness to Sci Am I should mention that the article was a fairly <br>
evenhanded depiction of Rifkin, that didn't explicitly, or implicitly<br>
as far as I could tell,<br>
endorse his views. Anyone interested in science needs to be aware of<br>
those who oppose it.  I found it a useful article b/c I know <br>
very little about Rifkin, though I don't think the article in question<br>
presented the whole picture.  <br>
