     Arjen Kamphuis made the suggestion:<br>
     <br>
     Could we maybe, sort-of turn all the political threads into <br>
     problem-solving-oriented discussions?<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight adds:<br>
     <br>
     Eliezer, in the more lucid parts of a recent post, also encouraged <br>
     solution-based thinking.  I concur.  At a certain point, process <br>
     becomes tedious.  I think many of us have had a good opportunity to <br>
     vent our frustrations, state our anxiety and see how it occurs for <br>
     others.  Like most humans, I love a good drama but it's possible to <br>
     intellectually gnash out the semantics indefinitely with no definitive <br>
     action in place.  <br>
     <br>
     Meanwhile, someone has to figure out how to plug the hole in the boat <br>
     that's sinking.<br>
     <br>
     Often, to the credit of those posting on this list, solutions are <br>
     offered up but they are back-burnered (or overlooked) for the sake of <br>
     the soapboxes being set up &lt;G&gt;.  Sounds like Congress a little...<br>
