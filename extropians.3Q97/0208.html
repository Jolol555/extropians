<p>
What's this mysterious 'E-Prime' problem that you and Hagbard keep <br>
bringing up? If it's something along the lines of, "Human perceptions are <br>
limited, therefore our abstractions, definitions, and philosophies are <br>
all based on incomplete and possibly false data and can't be trusted," <br>
then it's not the E-Prime problem, but a problem that Plato introduced <br>
into philosophy a long time ago. It's the basis of skepticism, mysticism, <br>
subjectivism, and a whole host of other crippling mental concepts.<br>
<p>
Why do you shy away from ranking philosophies? Obviously some <br>
philosophies are better than others. Likewise, some whole sets of <br>
philosophies are superior to other sets. I'd venture that the <br>
philosophies influenced by Aristotle's work have done far more good for <br>
people than all the philosophies influenced by the Hindu Vedas. Likewise, <br>
the political philosophy of capitalism seems to be far more successful <br>
and beneficial than communism if one judges by the ample evidence <br>
available. Should I seek to avoid ranking these philosophies? Is it wrong <br>
or impossible for me to say, "Capitalism is a moral political system and <br>
communism isn't." or "A philosophy which morally sanctions the initiation <br>
of force is a bad philosophy and therefore inferior to those philosophies <br>
which prohibit the initiation of force."? It seems to me that you would <br>
say that this type of ranking is either bad or impossible (judging by <br>
your statement, "...to heirarchically rank human thought conjures the <br>
very shades of ideology I seek to avoid in the first place.")<br>
<p>
You also state that "I prefer to think of it in terms:  'this set of <br>
thinking is most useful to me in my life'.  If I cannot find a useful <br>
philosphy, I would develop one!" Aren't you simply then *judging <br>
(ranking)* a philosophy by how it makes you *feel* at any particular <br>
moment?, i.e. "I've been following this philosophy and I feel good. <br>
Therefore the philosophy I'm following is good." This is a very bad way <br>
to decide what philosophy one should follow.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;To commit means to pledge one's self to a *position* on an </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;issue, right? </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Not necessarily, and if you based your entire polemic on this </i><br>
<i>&gt;contention, I ask that you rethink it.  Humans make commitments </i><br>
<i>&gt;every day, either to a value, to a decision, to a way of thinking, </i><br>
<i>&gt;otherwise we would not be able to take any actions.  If anything, </i><br>
<i>&gt;Richter was responding to the demand to commit to an ideology with a </i><br>
<i>&gt;counter-commitment not to fall into position-based thinking.</i><br>
<p>
I admit I don't understand that last paragraph. First of all, I *did* <br>
base my polemic on the contention that to commit means to pledge one's <br>
self to a position on an issue. I think I'm justified in doing so, <br>
because that's one of the definitions of "commit" in my Webster's <br>
Dictionary. Your second sentence, "Humans make commitments every day, <br>
either to a value, to a decision, to a way of thinking, otherwise we <br>
would not be able to take any actions." I can accept. Then you say, "If <br>
anything, Richter was responding to the demand to commit to an ideology <br>
with a counter-commitment not to fall into position-based thinking." OK. <br>
(now I see that I misread this last sentence and that's what caused my <br>
misunderstanding). But why don't you think that the "counter-commitment <br>
not to fall into position-based thinking." is a position itself? If so, <br>
then it's not a counter-commitment, but just another commitment being <br>
something like "Accept no philosophies."<br>
<p>
What's scary about Richter's "position" of no-positions is that after <br>
discarding all the abstract concepts that philosophy contains - <br>
principles, values, ethics, etc. - the only thing Richter will have left <br>
to decide and judge his actions will be *feelings*. Feelings are not a <br>
good way to gain knowledge or make judgments. They are certainly not a <br>
good thing to base *all* of one's actions on - as one would be forced to <br>
do in order to follow Richter's recommendation to give up all abstract <br>
thought (to refuse to commit to any ideology - i.e. any abstract <br>
philosophical system.)<br>
<p>
Whaddya think?<br>
