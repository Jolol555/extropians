<i>&gt;There is a difference between the three systems you mention, on the </i><br>

<i>&gt;genitalium, automotive vehicles and comersial software are all </i><br>
<i>&gt;required to be fairly optimized. </i><br>
<p>
No, none of those are "optimized".  Insofar as they are optimized, germs and<br>
commercial software are heavily optimized for miniumum design requirements,<br>
even at the cost of performance.  Living systems in particular are bizarre<br>
cobbled-together things.  Their energy use is a reasonable approximation of<br>
optimal not because they are well-designed, but because the thermodynamic<br>
processes they use are very efficient.  Even with "inefficient" and indirect<br>
chemistry, they still come out pretty well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To build an optimised nano </i><br>
<i>&gt;self-reproducing device would be much harder than simply to make </i><br>
<i>&gt;something useful that can replicate. For example, a universal Turing </i><br>
<i>&gt;machine has been constructed in Conway's Life world. The entity is </i><br>
<i>&gt;very big and it was hard, but nothing near a thousands of genius-year </i><br>
<i>&gt;task, to do it. </i><br>
<p>
Nobody has presented a self-replicating Life system.  All Conway did was<br>
produce a feasibility proof, so you know it *can* be done.  Actually<br>
designing such a system is still considered not yet possible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The feasibility stems from the fact that you have </i><br>
<i>&gt;identical components that you can put together into bigger identical </i><br>
<i>&gt;components, and so on, and at each step you need only consider the </i><br>
<i>&gt;apparatus at a certain level of abstraction. If this is the right </i><br>
<i>&gt;analogy for nanotech, then the design work would seem tractable, once </i><br>
<i>&gt;the right tools are there. </i><br>
<p>
I think a machine-phase nanotech will be far harder to design than current<br>
biological nanosystems.  Chemical thermodynamics does a lot of work in<br>
current enzyme-driven systems, like locating substrates, moving substrates,<br>
and performing the reaction.  The biological system need only design the<br>
enzyme.  In current machine-phase proposals, all that has to be done<br>
deliberately, greatly adding to the complexity of the design, and to the<br>
energy costs.  Frankly, the proposals for wild machine-phase nanotech sound<br>
to me like they will need a host of Maxwell's demons inside instructing the<br>
device what to do to obtain its stupendous energy, and then telling it how to<br>
find all the individual atoms it needs to make itself.  Locating vast numbers<br>
of halogens in a non-aqueous environment is a really tough task.  Even in a<br>
saline solution, grabbing and using the chlorine won't be easy.<br>
<p>
Von Neumann concluded you'd need about 250,000 parts in an environment<br>
specifically designed for replication.  I think 1,000,000 in a lab<br>
environment where chemicals and energy are provided for the replicator is a<br>
reasonable lower bound.  Chemistry isn't specifically designed for<br>
replication like Von Neumann's system.<br>
