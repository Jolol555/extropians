Great points.  In the book I had read, _The Sexual Brain_, the author Simon<br>
LeVay brings up a case history of a child that was born as a male, but when<br>
he was circumcised, had some problems (I won't go into detail in deference<br>
to all).  Because of the mistake by the surgeon, they decided the best thing<br>
to do would be to make him a her.  The file was closed at the child's<br>
teenage years stating that all went well, a fisty child, but generally<br>
adapted to the change.<br>
<p>
Interestingly enough, a few weeks, I was watching television about sex<br>
changes and this same case was brought up.  It was reopened and disclosed<br>
the fact that the child did not in fact adapt well.  She never fit her role<br>
as a woman.  She didn't have sex, couldn't enjoy it, didn't menstruate, etc.<br>
She researched her own history and discovered the sex change as a child.<br>
She later had her sex changed back to a man and got married, and adopted a<br>
child.<br>
<p>
I think it the date for the first sex change is still a primary date because<br>
it references a lot of changes both within the medical community and<br>
society's first adaptations to  gender changes.  I think a second date would<br>
someone's voluntarily desire for a sex change and has it is performed, and<br>
that person is able to fully enjoy his or her new sex -- performing sex and<br>
having orgasms<br>
