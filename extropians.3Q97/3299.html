OK, here's a less silly answer:<br>

It's not the extreme curvature that gets you, it's the rate of change of<br>
curvature near "small" black holes or other condensed matter. This<br>
results<br>
in tidal forces, which are the perceived differences in the gravity pull<br>
on<br>
your feet versus the gravity pull on your head. Near a "small" condensed<br>
mass<br>
your feet and your head are not in the same inertial reference frame.<br>
"Small"<br>
is roughly stellar mass.<br>
<p>
OTH, if the mass is "large", (say, a glactic mass) then you can have a<br>
black<br>
hole with an event horizon that at a distance where the gravitational<br>
gradient<br>
is modest. In this case, you can cross the event horizon without being<br>
instantly<br>
ripped apart. Of course, you can't get back out.<br>
<p>
If the mass is a great deal larger and you are inside the event horizon,<br>
then<br>
you are said to be living in a universe with a positive curvature.<br>
