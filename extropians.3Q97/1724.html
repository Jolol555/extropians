&lt;&lt; &gt;How much of the brain does it take to support the personality? Surely the<br>

That is surely false.<br>
 <br>
  "The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to<br>
 play any role in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities which seem<br>
 to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear<br>
 images which can be "voluntarily" reproduced and combined. ...<br>
 The above mentioned elements are, in my case, of visual and some of muscular<br>
 type. Conventional words or other signs have to be sought for laboriously<br>
 only in a secondary stage ..." Albert Einstein, as quoted in _The Psychology<br>
 of Invention in the Mathematical Field_, by Jacques Hadamard<br>
 <br>
  Hadamard presents much more evidence of this nature that visual processes<br>
 are more important than any other obvious area in the thoughts of the best<br>
 mathematicians.<br>
 --  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I beleive that this argument was aired earlier...ie. " A blind man can't<br>
think?'<br>
<p>
But that's not the point....provissionally conceded that the visual cortex IS<br>
needed...but what about that part of the brain that controls how I wrinkle my<br>
left eyelid...or that part of the brain which controls the secretion of<br>
sweat....or that portion of the brain that........<br>
<p>
The point is that, surely, not all the brain is required to support a<br>
personality....and I suspect that MOST of the brain is NOT required...<br>
<p>
And I'm curious as to which and how much.<br>
