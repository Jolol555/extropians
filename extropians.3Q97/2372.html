OK, you have a point. But a TNT attack is quite noticeable, and is<br>
likely to make not just me but a lot of my friends, neighbors and<br>
people in general react; the offender would have to deal with this. <br>
But this is the ordinary weapons control problem (admittedly tricky),<br>
not the more interesting (and IMHO far more dangerous) problem of<br>
designing a nanotech immune system. <br>

<i>&gt; nanotech strategies paper when I have finished the ones I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; working on now (one of which is on what a superintelligence could</i><br>
<i>&gt; be expected to do etc.).</i><br>
<p>
I think someone might have beaten you to it. When I was fairly young,<br>
I read a book about all the readical possibilities predicted by<br>
science in the early 70's (I forget the name, the author might have<br>
been Russian. And yes, it has influenced me profoundly!), and it<br>
mentioned a very similar scenario. The whole world is paved with<br>
a huge 2000-story building covering all the continents, and the<br>
oceans are algae-farms. Inside the building, people live in small<br>
cubicles and communicate using phone and television (OK, it is a 70's<br>
scenario). The problem of heat emissions was mentioned. <br>
<p>
A somewhat similar idea can be found in _A Torrent of Faces_ by Blish<br>
and Knight. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; So it </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; might be a good idea to design *and* evolve your defenses to make</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; them unique. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why design *and* evolve? I mean, obviously they would evolve if we </i><br>
<i>&gt; first design one version and then an improved version; but why would </i><br>
<i>&gt; they evolve in the sense we were discussing, i.e. by sexual </i><br>
<i>&gt; reproduction and natural selction? If there is an advantage in having </i><br>
<i>&gt; a system that is unknown to your enemy, then change the design often, </i><br>
<i>&gt; or include random elements. This avoids seriously maladaptive </i><br>
<i>&gt; offspring, introduces the unknowability exactly where it matters, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and is quicker. Besides, natural evolution would often be </i><br>
<i>&gt; predictable by the enemy if he knows the fitness landscape.</i><br>
<p>
Design is good at jumping over deserts in the fitness landscape,<br>
while evolution is good at searching it. If you combine occasional<br>
re-design with evolution, you can add optimizations and clever tricks<br>
to the powerful abilities of evolutionary programming. There will be<br>
a certain overhead, but it is an overhead for your immune-computer<br>
not for your design capabilities.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think complicated organisms are still quite viable, since they have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the advantage of fast cultural evolution before biological evolution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It doesn't matter if their biology is about diamond or water.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would find it very interesting if you could expand a bit on this.</i><br>
<p>
Nanodevices might be able to out-compete organic life, since they<br>
could be indigestible while organics are perfectly good feedstock.<br>
But intelligent systems communicating with each other are likely<br>
quite good at resisting attacks from low-level systems, be they<br>
bacteria or goo, since they can (at a sufficiently high level of<br>
technology) develop solutions, be they vaccines, immune processors or<br>
antibiotics using cultural evolution, which is faster than biological<br>
evolution and able to make deliberate leaps in fitness space. <br>
<p>
As an example, assume the worst scenario happens and an escaped badly<br>
programmed dishwashing nanite starts to turn all organic life into<br>
more of itself. It will spread with the speed of an bacterial<br>
infection, and be quite deadly. Of course, as soon as this becomes<br>
known there will be several groups who quickly enclose themselves in<br>
their already built underground bases (Cheyenne mountain is an<br>
example that exists today, and with this level of nanotech I think<br>
there will be more "nanosurvivalists" waiting for the disaster). So<br>
while the biosphere turns to dishwashing goo there will be people<br>
around who are very motivated to find a weapon against it, for<br>
example a tailored "predator nanite" or something similar. It doesn't<br>
appear likely that the goo could wipe out all the people (just a very<br>
large amount of them), and then it would just evolve in an ordinary<br>
way while the survivors were quite busy dealing with it (or adapt<br>
themselves to it, creating a new nano-based biosphere through<br>
"reverse terraforming").<br>
