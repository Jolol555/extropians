<i>&gt;&gt;  I never said that /they/ give a damn.  Self-perception is not reality.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;No Lee, you missed my point. what I said was " to use that line of thinking</i><br>
<i>&gt;to ignore the truth of that reality, to NOT acknowledge their very real</i><br>
<i>&gt;experience of starving to death, is denial of the worst sort, and IMO</i><br>
<i>&gt;downright mean. "</i><br>
<i>&gt;Take for example the issue of Affirmative action. One could say " I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;care for it, it is obviously not working, it is discriminatory in itself, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;has F**cked up many businesses, and it creates far more complex problems than</i><br>
<i>&gt;the simple one ( racist hiring practices) it was conceived to deflect".</i><br>
<i>&gt;But many people chose INSTEAD to claim : RASCISM IS A THING OF THE PAST.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It sounds bogus and it is. Saying poor people are richer may sound</i><br>
<i>&gt;comforting, but it doesn't address the reality * of those people*. Self</i><br>
<i>&gt;perception may not have anything to do with YOUR reality, but it does for</i><br>
<i>&gt;that individual. If I am hungry - you saying i am not doesn't do much to</i><br>
<i>&gt;change it.</i><br>
<p>
I didn't miss the point at all; your very use of phrases like "YOUR<br>
reality" pegs the issue precisely: there is only one reality.  Period.<br>
If you insist on subjectivism, we can argue no further, for I refuse<br>
to sacrifice the power of my mind to failed philosophies.  My saying<br>
that you are not hungry doesn't change the facts, nor does your saying<br>
that you are--either you are or you aren't, and your feelings have no <br>
more value than mine.  We must judge the facts objectively.  The facts,<br>
objectively, are that racism exists, laws against it don't work, no<br>
one in the US has inadequate access to food, and most people who feel<br>
poor are pretty well off.  My mother grew up in the Mississippi swamp,<br>
with a drunkard father who tried to keep her out of school, two younger<br>
siblings to take care of, gigging frogs and shooting squirrels for<br>
dinner, but she didn't feel poor. <br>
<p>
Hungry people need food.  Real food, not sympathy, compassion, caring,<br>
or concern; but food.  Calories.  Vitamins.  Food is produced by labor<br>
and technology, not by protests and political posturing.  Today's poor<br>
live better than my mother did--in absolute, objective terms--because<br>
the free market produced more food, more goods, more medicine, and<br>
more of everything else that people want.  Yes, people stil suffer, as<br>
those at the low end of technology always will.  The best thing that<br>
any of us can do for those people is to produce more things: work,<br>
trade, invest, invent.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;  What's "proper"?  "adequate"? </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Again, it is a perception. But it is up to the individual to decide, not</i><br>
<i>&gt;some golden mean you make up. I say it means a fairly comfortable creature</i><br>
<i>&gt;existence. Enough money to make ends meet.</i><br>
<p>
If you refuse to define terms objectively, we have nothing to argue.  If<br>
I, as an individual, decide that "enough" means a T1 line to my house,<br>
does that mean I can prevail upon your sympathy to give it to me?  How<br>
is that any different from a pauper begging for the services of a doctor<br>
who spent $30,000 in medical school?  I know that you are not in favor<br>
of entitlements as a distribution method, and I'm not accusing you of<br>
socialism, but subjectivist epistemology leads that way, and is every<br>
bit as dangerous.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Name a single person in the US who does not have more</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  than sufficient food available to him at no cost.  </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am not on first name terms, but there are plenty - and lots of them are</i><br>
<i>&gt;mentally ill and infants. BTW, I want to stop this now and make it clear: I</i><br>
<i>&gt;am not saying that this problem exists because WE SHOULD FEED THEM -that is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;different subject!  It is maybe because they are too mentally ill to claim</i><br>
<i>&gt;it, or on drugs, or brain deficient, or remote - or something else...but I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;not going to be persuaded they don't exist because one cannot  state one</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual personally on a first name basis. This argument fails to convince.</i><br>
<p>
It's the only argument that matters.  The only proof that something<br>
exists is to show the thing itself; point to one.  I agree that there<br>
may be people who, despite /access/ to adequate food, do not actually<br>
get fed with it because of incapacity.  That's a real problem, and to<br>
the extent that we can identify those people and help them--great (and<br>
note that identifying them, by name, is the very first necessary step <br>
in helping them; a step you seem reluctant to perform). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If one lacks the necessary tools to survive in that culture ( and by your</i><br>
<i>&gt;description they will) then Evolution will be as unkind today as it is on</i><br>
<i>&gt;our homeless little brothers in the streets...</i><br>
<p>
Evolution is not "kind" or "unkind"; it is nothing more than a mathematical<br>
consequence of a certain set of initial conditions: replication, mutation,<br>
competition.  Far better to understand and make use of an existing effect<br>
than to try to fight it.  You might as well try fighting pi.<br>
