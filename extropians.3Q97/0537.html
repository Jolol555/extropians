<p>
Was an excellent tactic to penetrate hilly central and eastern europe to<br>
attack Soviet columns that would be expected in a blitzkreig attack<br>
outnumbering NATO by 20 to 1. The laser bombs  carried by the FB were<br>
developed to take out our own bridges, which were precisely surveyed, to<br>
slow and impede a Soviet advance.<br>
<p>
Lockheed were pushing for fighter and bomber derivatives of<br>
<i>&gt; the SR-71 -- flying at 70,000+ feet and Mach 3+ to simply outrun any</i><br>
<i>&gt; defences -- and conducted tests to prove that the YF-12 (the fighter</i><br>
<i>&gt; derivative prototype) could happily cruise along up there blowing F111s</i><br>
<i>&gt; out of the sky as they crawled along at ninety feet. Not to mention that</i><br>
<i>&gt; something like 50% of the F111 bombers stationed in Britain flew</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves into the ground in training.</i><br>
<p>
As I recall, lookdown shootdown radar was not developed till the 80's,<br>
and the computing power to clean out the gound noise to spot a guy at 90<br>
feet was decades away. The soviets did not have this capability till the<br>
late 80's with their Mig-31.<br>
<p>
Also, outside of losses in Vietnam, F-111's lost less than 10% attrition<br>
over 20 years. WHile I was stationed in NM, we lost one plane (out of<br>
over 60), and that was a hydraulic failure, not a TFR failure. The TFR<br>
has a failsafe where it puts the plane into a steep climb out if it<br>
malfunctions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Lousy aircraft, like most political designs. Particularly lousy terrain</i><br>
<i>&gt; following radar.</i><br>
<p>
That happens to consistently win awards at Red Flag bombing exercises.<br>
<p>
The only real things that sucked about it from an air combat point of<br>
view was it size and its damn swing wings. With so little wing area,<br>
proportionately, that there is a high wing loading, and the swing wings,<br>
that are automatically positioned based on the planes kinetic energy<br>
level, its adversary can automatically see which planes are in weak<br>
positions at which points in a dogfight by the position of the<br>
swingwing. This is why when I was working on F-15 Eagles outside of<br>
Tacoma, we consistently beat the hell out of the Navy Top Guns (flying<br>
F-14s) at Miramar in our annual cross service dogfight grudge match.<br>
