   As one who considers the burning of the Library at Alexandria to be <br>
the most <br>
enormous crime in history I find your position _extremely_ distressing. <br>
I think<br>
an SI would at least have the brainpower to know that it cannot know <br>
the <br>
consequences of its information destruction. (The notion that it could <br>
reconstruct that information is garbage, IMO.)<br>
   Free energy, space, and matter are the lowest forms and most <br>
available <br>
resourses. The arrangments of atoms, and the coevolving interactions of <br>
<p>
these various structures, are far more important than the low forms.<br>
<p>
   It takes much less effort to colonize a new star system than to <br>
obliterate <br>
every competing intelligence or SI in one particular system. Once such <br>
a <br>
colony is established, it is much easier to defend it than to attack <br>
it.<br>
