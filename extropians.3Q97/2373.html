The IRA have been blowing up large parts of London with ammonium nitrate<br>
for decades. Even with such monitoring and oppressive laws they still blow<br>
up London on a fairly regular basis. <br>

'Basement Nukes' from Loompanics Unlimited contains various recipes for<br>
nerve poisons. I'm surprised noone has transcribed that onto the Net yet. <br>

That depends; even if you can't buy enriched fissionables directly, a<br>
modern uranium-purifying plant would be a tiny fraction of the size of the<br>
Manhattan Project, particularly if you were willing to trade size for time<br>
(e.g. a plant of half the size would take twice as long to build a bomb).<br>
Any well-funded terrorist group who wanted a nuke could probably build<br>
one, and as governments poke their noses deeper into our affairs, more and<br>
more people will have the desire to do so; indeed, nukes are far more<br>
useful to non-territorial groups than they are to governments, because MAD<br>
doesn't work if you can't nuke the opposition. <br>
<p>
Personally I'll be surprised if we don't see at least one major city nuked<br>
by 2010. I'll be even less surprised if the current rush towards a world<br>
government continues.<br>
