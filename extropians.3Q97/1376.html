Dale Carrico asks-<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;why can't we</i><br>
<i>&gt;interpret acts of discrimination simply as breaches of contract?  If we</i><br>
<i>&gt;assume that most people imagine that they are being hired to do a job and</i><br>
<i>&gt;do it well, why can't we say then that, should this be the case, an</i><br>
<i>&gt;employer who fires demotes or otherwise unfairly treats an employee in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;service of some fool prejudice is breaching contract with her -- unless</i><br>
<i>&gt;something about the employer's racism, sexism, or whatever had a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;conspicuous place *in* the contract to begin with?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think either permanent employment or an unchanging or unconditional<br>
definition of the job is usually assumed.  Interesting idea to contractually<br>
agree on what the job *isn't*, though, to put in something saying, "We<br>
specifically don't care whether X, Y, Z... and we won't fire you for<br>
those reasons."  Advertising "An Equal Opportunity Employer" might be<br>
taken to imply that, too.  (Although currently...is saying that a legal<br>
requirement?)<br>

 Taken..." --Daniel Dennett
