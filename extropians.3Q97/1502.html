My oldest daughter Kirsten is 14. She is heavily involved in an<br>
internet-based group of Star Trek/Voyager fans, mostly female<br>
and mostly aged 11 to 21 or so. The group focuses on romantic<br>
relationships among crew members of Voyager. She maintains a<br>
set of web pages that included pages for each relationship.<br>
Recently, some group members started considering homosexual<br>
relationships, and Kirsten came to me for a policy decision,<br>
since the pages are in my directory on our ISP.<br>
<p>
Here's what we decided:<br>
  1) such relationships are listed, but are likned from a<br>
page that recommends that the younger readers check with<br>
their parents. This is intended to minimize hassles from<br>
parents and is in no way a value judgement on my part.<br>
<p>
Here's the interesting part: I strongly suspect that people<br>
who are uncomfortable with homosexual relationships among the<br>
fictional characters will still be comfortable with the<br>
heterosexual relationships, even though those relationships are<br>
interspecies, and we have no idea what the sexual physiology<br>
or practices of the non-humans is! I mean, how many Vulcans<br>
does it take to screw in? We haven't had any negative comments<br>
yet, but I don't know whether the parents are monitoring their<br>
kid's internet usage.<br>
