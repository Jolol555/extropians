Well, actually it's backed by a threat of force called the legal-tender<br>
laws.  If you take that threat away, people would go back to using<br>
currencies based on a most-marketable good in short order.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Gold was hardly useful or practically valuable itself.  Jewelry</i><br>
<i> &gt; only goes so far, and chip wires are new and also probably don't</i><br>
<i> &gt; go that far.  (You can't eat gold.)  But everyone believed that</i><br>
<i> &gt; everyone else would sell food or iron or blacksmithing for gold,</i><br>
<i> &gt; so everyone sold things for gold.  Again, the real backing is mutual</i><br>
<i> &gt; agreement, or rather faith and habit which may get rationalized as</i><br>
<i> &gt; mutual agreement.  (Or they may not.)</i><br>
<p>
The non-catallactic utility of gold has been just a small part<br>
of its value; the relationship between the catallactic value of<br>
gold and the non-catallactic value of gold is vaguely similar<br>
to the relationship between unbacked notes and reserves in a<br>
fractional-reserve system.  But what gets something established<br>
in the first place as a currency is its status as a<br>
most-marketable good, and that requires some non-catallactic<br>
utility in the first place.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I can't see that there's any serious problem with fiat currency</i><br>
<i> &gt; except the ability to "print" a lot of it, which seems to be</i><br>
<i> &gt; generally accepted as a bad idea these days.</i><br>
<p>
The serious problem with monopolized fiat currency is the implicit<br>
tax on currency-holders that happens with every expansion of the<br>
money supply relative to demand ("velocity").  Just because that<br>
implicit, regressive tax is not abused so much as to seriously<br>
threaten the stability of the economy (anymore... it was different<br>
in the 1970s) doesn't make it right, doesn't make it any better<br>
than the political fraud that it is.<br>
