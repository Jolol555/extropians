I think I missed the original post on this one, but I am fascinated <br>
by the underlying assumption that one can develop into a 'whole', <br>
fully developed human by reading books!  I think that books can play <br>
an important role in learning, but there is no substitute for getting <br>
out there and living, taking risks, pushing yourself beyond your <br>
limits, making mistakes, enduring the hurt and the raptures.  Life <br>
events can be designed to provide experiential learning or boundary <br>
breaking (edge gaming), and one could look at life as one long <br>
experiment.<br>
