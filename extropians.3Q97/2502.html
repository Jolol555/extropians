<i>        &gt;many of the immigrants are "illegal", but the government lacks the</i><br>

<p>

Government also lacks the ability, incompetence is not always a bad thing.<br>

<p>
<p>
Nonsense. There are lots of menial tasks that need to be done around my house,<br>
they need no special skills and I would be happy to pay somebody a dollar an<br>
hour to perform them, but not more, I won't pay minimum wage because to me<br>
it's only worth a dollar an hour. There are millions if not billions of<br>
people in the world who would consider a dollar an hour wealth beyond the<br>
dreams of avarice. Both of us would be better off if we could get together,<br>
but one thing prevents us, government.<br>
<p>
As for cultural differences preventing free immigration, if I found a culture<br>
to be unpleasant then I wouldn't want to go to that land, if I didn't then I<br>
would.  What's the problem?<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It may very well be breaking down (slowly), but what will replace it?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The free market.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You seem to forget that most people aren't "rational libertarian </i><br>
<i>        &gt;entities" </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I have not forgotten, the market can not guarantee a libertarian society,<br>
nothing can, but it can encourage it. Suppose government did not force you to <br>
buy law and police protection from them, suppose there was competition and you<br>
could purchase the laws you liked from companies that were willing to enforce<br>
them. It's easy to vote for some idiot politician who says he will stop your<br>
neighbor from sinning, it's much harder to shell out cold hard cash for it.<br>
For example, in this democracy many towns have laws against women wearing<br>
string bikinis on the beach, and it's simple to see why, there are plenty of <br>
prudes and it doesn't cost them anything to vote. Now let's consider this if<br>
justice was sold as a commodity. The prude is considering 2 protection<br>
companies that are identical except one has a law against bikinis and a<br>
decency patrol to harass women on the beach 20 miles from his home, the other<br>
doesn't but uses the money saved to send an extra security patrol through his<br>
neighborhood at 3Am. The prude would have to be very prudish indeed to pick<br>
the first Private Protection Agency.  Justice is no different than anything<br>
else, if you want to maximize it sell it in a free market.<br>
<p>
              <br>
<i>        &gt;"We" are the Caucasians (oh, it's that ugly word again)</i><br>
<p>
<p>
No not ugly, just rather quaint and old-fashioned, a phrase past its<br>
expiration date, like "moving pictures" or  "horse-less carriage" or  <br>
"phlogiston" or "luminiferous ether". <br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Try promoting the extropian principles in the Middle East or Africa</i><br>
<i>        &gt; etc, and see how far you'll get...</i><br>
<p>
<p>
About as far as you would in the bible belt of the USA.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;it's "bye, bye singularity" when the Muslims take over.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Your xenophobia is starting to sound a little silly.<br>
