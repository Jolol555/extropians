<i>&gt;... you want to agree on the topic but disagree on the opinions</i><br>
<i>&gt;about it, to have a good argument.  </i><br>
<p>
Your desire to argue is also a social signal.  Many people would like<br>
nothing better than to agree with all their friends on every<br>
conversation topic that comes up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In fact it's in the interest of both voters and representitives to</i><br>
<i>&gt;make government good at producing annoyance (stuff to get angry and</i><br>
<i>&gt;argue about) and bad at changing things (practical).</i><br>
<p>
To elaborate, people want political issues which are closely aligned<br>
with aspects of their own values that they want to signal to others,<br>
and which do not overly threaten how things actually get done.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Here's an example that this is happening:</i><br>
<i>&gt;An X-Files T-shirt, with the slogan, "I Want To Believe," is:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  o  an indicator that I'm an independent thinker interested in wacky</i><br>
<i>&gt;     ideas, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  o  an indicator that I'm a skeptic with some scientific training, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  o  an ironic meta-comment (maybe showing that people in general are</i><br>
<i>&gt;     becoming more aware) about the social function of belief, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  o  a damn fine practical piece of clothing.</i><br>
<p>
A nice example.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In short, a desert topping *and* a floor wax.  </i><br>
<p>
This phrasing gave the a serious case of the giggles.  :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The thing I noticed was that you put "maintain privacy"</i><br>
<i>&gt;and "enhance our figures" in the "functional" category.</i><br>
<p>
Good points.<br>
