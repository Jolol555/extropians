I really liked what Wax had to say. In an anarchy, all possibilities are<br>
allowed. I don't know why you are fixated on the idea that companies<br>
must all be owned by all of their employees. If they go into the job<br>
investing existing assets, then great, but the idea of giving one<br>
ownership for free when they start a job is dumb, not to mention<br>
economical unfeasible (people seem to wonder why the privatization of<br>
many companies in Russia has failed so badly).<br>
<p>
Employees should also have the right, as many currently do in this<br>
country, to invest whatever level they wish in the company, even $0. If<br>
they can make a better profit investing elsewhere, its their money. I'm<br>
really tired of people who think that people need to be protected from<br>
themselves. Stupidity is the last Darwinian influence on our society,<br>
lets not give that up, lest we begin to deevolve....<br>
<p>
Dear Michael and other fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
It would appear that not everyone is familar with Employees Stock<br>
Ownership Plans (ESOPS) or methods that have recently been developed of<br>
creating an environment that encourages cross cultural integration and<br>
cooperation. <br>
<p>
Hierarchys in many organizations are being flattened and are rapidly<br>
becoming obsolescent. This is primarily due to the changes in the economic<br>
environment and the need to compete more effectively. <br>
<p>
Middle managers in many organizations are being re-educated and are being<br>
converted into team leaders. Ultimately, such teams become virtual teams<br>
as knowledge, skills and abilities are interchanged and consoladated.<br>
Leadership at that point ceases to be an issue. <br>
<p>
Obviously, there are more than a few egocentric dinosaurs that are being<br>
phased out in this evolving environment. Far greater emphasis is placed on<br>
self-reliance and self-actualization is encouraged as a productivity<br>
enhancing asset. <br>
  <br>
Since it is a change of order and a shift in and sharing of power I don't<br>
think anyone who has studied management has considered the concept of<br>
Anarchy as a philosophical basis for change. It might seem a bit to<br>
abstract, unrealistic and ideologically fixated to provide much practical<br>
value for the majority of post-industrial leaders.<br>
<p>
I suspect that there are those who wish to express alternative proposals<br>
and opinions. The question will remain, however, as to the ease of<br>
implimentation.<br>
<p>
Enjoy!!!<br>
