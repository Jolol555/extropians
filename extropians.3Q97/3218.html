     Then Sagan is probably spinning in his grave... I haven't seen <br>
     'Contact' yet, but from what I've heard it sounds like a very poor <br>
     adaption of the book. I last read the book years ago, but the whole <br>
     point of the ending seemed to be that like a good scientist she <br>
     *found* the empirical proof to convince the world rather than <br>
     expecting them to believe on faith (in the real world millions of <br>
     people would have believed her story just as they do with UFOs today; <br>
     hell, she'd be a millionaire overnight).<br>

     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     It is a given in the film industry that the film adaption of a <br>
     previously published work is open to the interpretation of the <br>
     director's vision.  Take "The Lost World" for example.  Spielberg <br>
     wanted a T-Rex wreaking havoc on San Diego and so he incorporated it.  <br>
     <br>
     Books always have a different and more personal dimension because it <br>
     is up to the reader to provide the imagination behind the author's <br>
     words.  In a film, that is done for you.  You are left to interpret <br>
     the images and messages however implicit or blatant they are.  <br>
     <br>
     The beauty of a film like "Contact" is that it showed the dichotomy <br>
     between the scientific/skeptical mind set and the <br>
     metaphysical/spiritual/faith mind set and gave both validity in our <br>
     culture.  It wasn't exclusively about the inviobility of the laws of <br>
     physics, odds and probabilities and proof.  It also showed, when <br>
     someone's "faith" is skewed and fear-based, the level of violence and <br>
     destruction that can result.  <br>
     <br>
     Very often, what is classified as psuedo science is so haughtily <br>
     branded as crap as to shut down discussion, which is nothing less than <br>
     oppressive: humiliate someone into shutting up.  I think the more <br>
     intriguing notions are what press some people to *want* to believe and <br>
     why the myths, both historical and modern, dance so elusively through <br>
     our culture, even causing the types of upsets that they do in this <br>
     board.  Next to the "Goo" thread which wins hands down, this one is <br>
     pretty popular right now, with most of the responses coming forward to <br>
     debunk with fervor rather than explore the sociological and <br>
     psychological impact.  But that's not really what this discussion <br>
     digest is about so I guess I shouldn't press it.<br>
