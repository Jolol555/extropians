I read this paragraph wrong the first time, I thought you were saying that<br>
the 'points of mutual interest' glow and vibrate.  Which would also be.. um..<br>
interesting.<br>
<p>
How about a pocket sized computer, not unlike a calculator, with lists of<br>
various tastes and fetishes.  When you see a potential partner you simply<br>
point it at them, punch in your desired fantasy (Mrs. Peacock, with the<br>
candlestick, in the study) and it displays the exact amount of alcohol needed<br>
before they'll give it a go!<br>

Wax - Who doesn't wear any rings, has no idea what that means and isn't sure<br>
he wants to know.<br>
