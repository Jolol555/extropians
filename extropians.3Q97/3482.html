     I would like to see our combined intelligence and illumination<br>
     distributed among the masses, however unworthy or illogical that may<br>
     seem to some, rather than hoarded among the privileged few.<br>

     I tried to point out to Holly that extropy is not a secret. We are not<br>
     hoarding arcane wisdom from the Ancients. There is no system of <br>
     degrees or initiation. <br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight:<br>
     <br>
     Clarification: The "we" was not Extropians (I am not an Extropian, <br>
     more of a voyeur, an optimistic futurist, a jack mystic, I dunno, <br>
     whatever...) but people of influence and intelligence.  <br>
     <br>
     Hagbard continues:<br>
     <br>
     Rick, you happen to have not only a tactful diplomatic manner, but <br>
     also a desire to see the meme propogate. I think you would<br>
     be a good apologist for extropian transhumanism in the mainstream.<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight:<br>
     <br>
     Thanks.  I believe my power to effectively see both sides and connect <br>
     the dots to be a strong point and one that will effect great and <br>
     powerful change one day.<br>
     <br>
     Hagbard:<br>
     <br>
     I've made this point a million times, but I'll make it again. Idealism<br>
     without praxis is non-utilitarian. <br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight:<br>
     <br>
     Excellent reminder to keep focus when emotion, dispair and <br>
     disorientation about this ever-changing world put you off track.  I <br>
     hear the pain, however angry and perceivedly irrational, that Holly is <br>
     speaking.  I perceive she is trying to process it, trying to make <br>
     sense of it.  Sometimes, that involves some hand waving and jumping <br>
     about but hopefully will not evoke too much defensiveness (which <br>
     results in nothing but a sidetrack dilusion into semantics and <br>
     clarified positions).<br>
     <br>
     I have just recently decided that, with the increasing anxiety I am <br>
     feeling about disparity in our culture (and our world) that talking <br>
     about it is doing no good at all.  In this current motif, it will take <br>
     people of power and influence to make genuine change.  Protesting and <br>
     banging the drum about it does serve to keep people reminded just like <br>
     everytime I pass by a disinfranchised person and feel that <br>
     disorientation in my own heart, I KNOW something's not right.<br>
     <br>
     And no, I don't believe it will *always* be that way as was previously <br>
     stated by a poster in this thread.  That sounds like Jesus to his <br>
     disciples rather than an Extropian perspective.  Different playing <br>
     field in the last years of the 20th century.  Bucky Fuller said the <br>
     resources were available for every person to live well and no one, no <br>
     matter how undeserving or uncontributing they may be regarded by the <br>
     more successful, should have to beg, starve or be cold.  Period.  <br>
     <br>
     For those without resources, protesting may be away of gathering <br>
     influence.  But the real influence will come when more of us begin <br>
     strategizing ways to allocate our resources so that we as a community <br>
     are restored.  As a wealthy friend of mine recently said, "it takes <br>
     having a lot of money to give you the opportunity to realize that your <br>
     real work is to make sure others can have what you have."  <br>
     <br>
