<i>&gt; Personally, I believe that we will be surprised by the abundance of</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness when we do finally 'discover' it.</i><br>
<p>
	I think you are probably right.  But there must be something<br>
that brings it all together into one conscious world.  Not only must<br>
it exist, it must exist in a way that it can be collected into and<br>
produce the entire world of our complete awareness.  There may be some<br>
elemental part of consciousness in all of physics but until it is<br>
brought into a conscious space or world it isn't of much use.  I would<br>
imagine that integrating multiple conscii is an exponentially complex<br>
problem.  I would bet that there can't simply be a global<br>
consciousness without lots of brain like machinery to make it so.  The<br>
equivalent of shared conscious space between two brains would likely<br>
be many times more complex than a single brain and the equivalent of 4<br>
mind melded brains would be many times more complex than just 4 brains<br>
and so on exponentially.  I would bet that we will have shared<br>
conscious worlds, but as far as a global consciousness... without<br>
infinite computing resources like we might have in an omega point, I<br>
would bet that it would be impossible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm going to be wildly speculative here: Could it be that</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness is a product of any logic (not just highly complex</i><br>
<i>&gt; networks such as our brain).</i><br>
<p>
	Logic is simply a set of rules that specify a particular<br>
behavior.  There must be something physical which implements or<br>
instantiates or performs this behavior.  I see no reason why logic<br>
does anything outside of whatever the particular physical phenomenon<br>
that is performing the logic is directly responsible for.  There must<br>
be some actual physical phenomenon that is producing the consciousness<br>
and it is this conscious phenomenon that represents or instantiates or<br>
performs the logic of our minds.  The conscious phenomenon of our<br>
minds are able to perform logical operations, it doesn't arise from<br>
that logic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course, consciousness could simply be the product of some</i><br>
<i>&gt; chemical, or brain pattern that we have evolved over the years.</i><br>
<p>
	Physical phenomenon don't evolve do they?  But entities<br>
abilities to use various physical phenomenon to better survive do<br>
evolve.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Whatever it is, if it exists we'll find it, it's just a matter of</i><br>
<i>&gt; time.</i><br>
<p>
	YES!  YES!  I bet this will be the most significant world<br>
changing discovery to date.<br>
