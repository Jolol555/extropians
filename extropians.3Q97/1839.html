<p>
Hard to tell; my guess would be that roughly half of the cortex isn't<br>
directly sensor or motor areas. But it would be a mistake to say that<br>
personality isn't a part of them, there are likely big individual<br>
differences even there, and a small perceptual difference (say, red<br>
is more strongly linked to emotion than usual) can affect personality<br>
a lot. In fact, I see personality as a property of the whole system,<br>
including aspects of the endocrine system and the rest of the body. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now look at it from a different perspective.  How many personalities occupy</i><br>

<i>&gt; My understanding of the "Society of Mind" and other works is that there are a</i><br>

<i>&gt; one personality....not true....there are many personalities....each coming</i><br>
<i>&gt; "on line" as the situation warrants...and going dormant when not needed. All</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking it is the only one.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it is unclear how many there are. We do not have a good<br>
definition of personality (IMHO), and they seem to be quite blurred.<br>
I'm usually happy, does that mean I have a happy personality or is<br>
the happiness independent of personality? One could make a case for<br>
both, but I think it is largely fruitless (I didn't really like<br>
personality psychology, I'm more of a cognitive/neuro psychology<br>
type). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Walter Jon Williams and Louis McMaster Bujold's works speculate as to what</i><br>
<i>&gt; would happen were this not the case.  Suppose you had multiple personalities,</i><br>
<i>&gt; a well integrated "team" of personalities.  I REALLY wish I did....have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; personallity who didn't find lifting weights to be unutterably boring....so I</i><br>
<i>&gt; could do something interesting while he was exercising the body.</i><br>
<p>
Why not try developing one? Maybe imagine "Muscle Mick" or something<br>
similar, a version of yourself that really likes weightlifting, and<br>
then letting him do the training. At first you would have to<br>
participate, but in time you will be free to think of other things as<br>
Muscle Mick did his workout. <br>
