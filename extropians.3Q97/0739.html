<i>&gt; From: James Rogers &lt;jamesr@best.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This model assumes that everyone operates as an independent contractor.  My</i><br>
<i>&gt; favorite aspects of this model is that it would make the work environment</i><br>
<i>&gt; very market driven.  It would allow rapid and accurate adjustments in wages</i><br>
<i>&gt; as the market changed and as job requirements changed.  However, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; current structure of business is too rigid to adapt to such a fluid and</i><br>
<i>&gt; equilibrium sensitive job model.  I do know of (and have worked for) a</i><br>
<i>&gt; couple small companies that actually operate this way.</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately, such companies would almsot certainly be torn apart by<br>
IRS regulations concerning who is and is not considered an employee<br>
for tax purposes. Operating as an independant contractor is highly<br>
discouraged by the tax laws. Do too much work for one entity, and<br>
suddenly both you and they will be in trouble with the IRS.<br>
<p>
As someone who makes his living doing consulting work, I'm acutely<br>
aware of the issues involved...<br>
<p>
