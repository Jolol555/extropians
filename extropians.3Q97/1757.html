John, this is a strong claim, and I for one am skeptical. Of course,<br>
you can keep pulling more signal out of a Mandelbrot set as you<br>
fall into its infinite depths, but hey, in *some* sense, we *know*<br>
what we are going to be getting out of it. The "fractal character"<br>
of the curves that emerge from increasing levels of mathematical<br>
magnification doesn't change much no matter how deep you go.<br>
<p>
Going deeply into a grape, however, you run into, well, unknown<br>
things. Who knows what's down in there? Superstrings? Membranes?<br>
What? It's not as if the structure just stops at the level of quarks<br>
and leptons... at least I suspect it's not, because the history of<br>
science so far has been that the more you study a real physical<br>
object, the weirder it gets.<br>
<p>
If by "the shape of a grape" all you meant was "ellipsoid", well,<br>
then you're just comparing a complex Platonic mathematical object<br>
to a simple Platonic mathematical object, and you're not engaging<br>
with Hara's Preal distinction at all. This is why I assumed you<br>
meant the full three-dimensional curve of the grape in full detail,<br>
interior and exterior.<br>
