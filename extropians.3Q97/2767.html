<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; I recently stated my disagreement with the extropian terminology "dynamic</i><br>
<i>&gt;  optimism" partly because it implies that extropian "optimism" results from</i><br>
<i>&gt;  irrational faith rather than hard-headed realistic evaluation of fact.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The thing is you have to believe more than fact if you're going to get</i><br>
<i>&gt; anywhere, you need vision.</i><br>
<p>
Nonsense.  You don't have to "believe" a thing to have vision,<br>
courage, and opportunity.  You may have to be willing to take a<br>
chance, and to commit to something on incomplete proof, but you<br>
certainly don't have to believe.  I don't particularly believe<br>
that cryonincs in its present form can achieve what it claims,<br>
or that it is the best investment I can make in my future; I don't<br>
have enough evidence to know that.  But I have bet my life (and<br>
$120,000) on it.  It didn't take belief, just commitment. <br>
<p>
Some of the "dynamic optimism" wording is a bit touchy-feely for<br>
my tastes, but I can see what Max is trying to say, and it is a<br>
part of the vision that fits well.  In particular, I have to<br>
disagree with his particular objections to the fine art of<br>
complaining, a noble profession if done well.  True, most people<br>
aren't very good at it and just waste their energy, but it can<br>
achieve positive results if applied rationally and optimistically.<br>
