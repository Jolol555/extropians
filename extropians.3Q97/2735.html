Note to extropy list members:<br>
	I participate in an e-mail list for LDS (Mormon) scientists.<br>
(or at least science lovers) I sometimes discuss extropianism on this<br>
list and someone asked what extropianism is.  I'm cc'ing my reply to<br>
the extropian list in hopes that it might generate some cross<br>
discussion or so that someone might be able to correct me where I'm<br>
mistaken in my obviously LDS slanted attempted definition of<br>
extropianism.  I can forward any extropians@extropy.org replies to<br>
this thread back to the eyring-l@majordomo.netcom.com list and visa<br>
versa.<br>
<p>
<p>
Hi Carl &lt;ctcox@juno.com&gt;,<br>
<p>
	You asked:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Brent [said he is] first and foremost an Extropian.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; My dictionary doesn't include that word, and I don't have access to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the www. How about a definition for us rural deprived people. :-)</i><br>
<p>
	What?  You don't have www access?  You definitely must not yet<br>
be extropian then! ;) Any search for the term in any web search engine<br>
will net a wealth of information about it.<br>
<p>
	Extropy is the complement to Entropy.  It isn't its opposite,<br>
it simply works with it.  As entropy increases, it drives the extropic<br>
process and things spontaneously improve and get better.  Unlike the<br>
term "entropy" but like the term "information" it is difficult to<br>
describe mathematically or even rigorously.  But, as they say: "You<br>
know it when you see it."  One example would be, as you look back in<br>
time you can see the results of the unstoppable evolutionary increase<br>
in extropy recorded in the fossil record and also the revolutionary<br>
increases in recent history.<br>
<p>
	As the great extropian Anders Sandberg said: "Resistance is<br>
futile, you will be transcended." ;)<br>
<p>
	Extropians are simply optimists.  Rather than faithlessly<br>
thinking that things are "going to hell in a hand-basket", they<br>
believe that things are getting better.  Not only this, but they have<br>
faith that, through works, things will continue to get better at an at<br>
least exponential rate and they hope that there will be no limit to<br>
this progress.  As long as there is any problem anywhere, like say,<br>
there is still a loved one stuck in hell (if there really is such a<br>
thing) or the grave or whatever, they will forever work, via any good<br>
means available to them, having faith that some day, some way or<br>
another, they might find or achieve a good way to solve the problem.<br>
If forcing the person to be good isn't a good way to get them out of<br>
hell, then they simply look and strive for some other way forever<br>
having faith that some other possible way exists.<br>
<p>
	We hope that all mankind might be saved and work with any<br>
reliable and rational means to achieve such.  Specifically: by<br>
discovering, understanding, and harnessing (i.e.  obedience to<br>
whatever laws are required or on which the natural miracle is<br>
predicated) all reliably knowable laws physical and otherwise.  Many<br>
extropians believe that the miraculous work done by all the<br>
generations preceding us has given our generation the privilege of<br>
being the first generation to have a technology, cryonic preservation,<br>
that might possibly enable us to make it to the beginning of the time<br>
(I like to call it "The Millennium" ;) in which there will finally be<br>
no additional forced death.<br>
<p>
	We believe that as some people now think God is, we may all<br>
become.<br>
<p>
	*I* believe that the logically necessary promise made to our<br>
fathers will be planted in the hearts of our immortal children, and<br>
that they will forever strive to repay the dept they owe to their<br>
ancestors for doing the miraculous God like thing of living and<br>
working to give them a glorious heavenly immortal life.  The hearts of<br>
these children shall necessarily turn to and seek after their fathers.<br>
If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted.<br>
<p>
	We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured<br>
many things, and hope to be able to endure all things.  If there is<br>
anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek<br>
after these things.<br>
<p>
	This is a very small part of extropianism.  Extropianism is<br>
different for different people.  This is obviously my own spin on what<br>
it is.<br>
<p>
	Anyway, there is so much more, but I hope these few words of<br>
attempted (and probably twisted ;) definition help at least a little.<br>
<p>
