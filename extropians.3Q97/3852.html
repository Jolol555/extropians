The last time I saw an economic model for airships, the numbers<br>
indicated that conventional aircraft, at the time, did the job at<br>
less cost.  That analysis, though, dated from about fifteen years<br>
ago.  Since that time, the cost of infrastructure, capital<br>
investment in airframes, fuel costs (and efficiencies), flying<br>
crew, etc. costs have no doubt changed quite a good deal.  In<br>
addition, that fifteen year old model may have contained many<br>
errors and omissions.<br>
<p>
You may have already published a "business model" breakdown;  if<br>
so, perhaps you could dig through your messages and privately<br>
forward it to me.<br>
<p>
Factors related to airship transport that would have to appear in<br>
a useful comparative business model would include such factors as<br>
service range and anticipated service duty-cycle.  Some factors<br>
not particularly relevant for conventional aircraft (which, for<br>
the most part, fly "above the weather" and thus have<br>
weather-dependencies limited to conditions at airport locations)<br>
include blocked service because of predicted intermediate weather<br>
conditions, and limited service range because of the unreliability<br>
of medium term weather forecasts.<br>
<p>
Other factors that might have relevance (and might get overlooked)<br>
relate to the barriers that airships faced (and could not<br>
overcome) in the '30's.  One worth considering relates to the<br>
availability (both quantity and political control) of helium.<br>
Another factor that needs to get addressed relates to the<br>
structural survivability of airships in the face of strong<br>
wind-shear conditions.  (Has anyone performed a finite element<br>
analysis?)  I would guess that increased survivability would<br>
increase service availability, but reduce payload per unit capital<br>
investment.  A relatively complex model might prove necessary to<br>
determine an optimum balance between those factors plus the cost<br>
of air and ground crew.<br>
<p>
How do the fuel-efficiency numbers (joules per kg-m of payload)<br>
work out?  Alternatively, for low mass cargo, how does the<br>
efficiency work out when measured as joules/m^4?  (How many joules<br>
to move a cubic meter one meter?)  Lower speeds would presumably<br>
result in lower turbulence losses, however I would guess that an<br>
airship (or collection of airships) capable of moving the payload<br>
of a 767 would have a much greater frontal area than that of the<br>
767.  I have no idea of how the numbers turn out.<br>
<p>
Ground-crew and ground real-estate requirements also need some<br>
consideration.  What does it take to land a sufficient number of<br>
airships to represent a payload equivalent to, say, a 767, and how<br>
long would those airships stay on the ground compared to that<br>
hypothetical 767?  In the event of a complete grounding of the<br>
fleet, how much storage area would be necessary for the<br>
payload-year equivalent of the current conventional aircraft<br>
fleet?<br>
<p>
While, for the most part, airships would probably occupy flight<br>
levels well below those of commercial aircraft, it would seem<br>
desirable to estimate the population of airships necessary for<br>
more than symbolic service (an estimate of, say, 30% of current<br>
aircraft payload moved per year would probably give a rough<br>
first-guess at the size of an effective airship fleet), the<br>
flight-paths for a hypothetical business system, the impact on<br>
general aviation, and the political risks involved.<br>
<p>
Finally (of the things I can think of for a realistic business<br>
model), it would probably be possible to make at least a rough<br>
estimate of the investment necessary to design and produce<br>
(including factory capital equipment) such airships.  I would<br>
guess that a twenty-year return on investment comparable to, say,<br>
Boeing, would probably represent a reasonable starting point for<br>
estimating the selling price of a 767-payload-year and a<br>
767-payload-lifetime equivalent airship.<br>
