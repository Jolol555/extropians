<i>&gt;I have heard several on this list talk positively about Robert Anton </i><br>
Wilson,  <br>
<i>&gt;I confess I've never read anything by him and always considered that a </i><br>
lack <br>
<i>&gt;in my education. Recent events have made me feel less guilty about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;Even by junk science standards the work of Immanuel Velikousky is </i><br>
really <br>
<i>&gt;stupid. He says that in historic times the planet Jupiter spit out a </i><br>
"comet" <br>
<i>&gt;that collided with Earth and bounced off and then, through various </i><br>
<i>&gt;gravitational gymnastics, parted the Red Sea and somehow caused all the  </i><br>
<i>&gt;miracles in the old testament. This "comet" then went into a circular </i><br>
orbit <br>
<i>&gt;around the sun and became the planet Venus! To call this idea idiotic </i><br>
would <br>
<i>&gt;be a unjust insult to all the fine self respecting idiots the world </i><br>
over. <br>
<i>&gt;The late great Carl Sagan had great fun pocking holes in this ignorant </i><br>
theory, <br>
<i>&gt;not that that's what made him great, it was too easy, like shooting </i><br>
fish in <br>
<i>&gt;a barrel.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;While poking around in the Science section of my local bookstore today </i><br>
I ran <br>
<i>&gt;across a misfiled book that belonged in the "new age" section next to </i><br>
the UFO <br>
<i>&gt;and Bigfoot books, it was called "Carl Sagan and Immanuel Velikousky" </i><br>
by <br>
<i>&gt;Charles Ginenthal. I didn't read it, but after thumbing through it for </i><br>
<i>&gt;5 minutes I could see it was a revolting attack on the life of Sagan </i><br>
and a<br>
<i>&gt;deification of Velikousky. On the back of the book was a blurb by </i><br>
Robert <br>
<i>&gt;Anton Wilson, he said this trash was  "an excellent and erudite </i><br>
destruction <br>
<i>&gt;of Saganism".  I don't want to destroy "Saganism" and reading something </i><br>
by <br>
<i>&gt;Wilson has just dropped about 164 places on my "to do" list.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                                    </i><br>
<i>&gt;                                               John K Clark   </i><br>

   After reading your above statements I urge you to read Robert Anton <br>
Wilson for all he's worth.  In the beginning of his book Cosmic Trigger <br>
he emphasizes to his readers that he "DOES NOT BELIEVE IN ANYTHING".  <br>
Bob is a trickster from the get go.  How much he is putting you on is up <br>
to you to decide.  Dogma is his enemy, encouraging you to think for <br>
yourself is his goal.<br>
   Although I respect Carl Sagan for his enormous contributions to the <br>
scientific community, I have always found him pedantic and dogmatic <br>
especially with regards to his involvement with CSICOP.  A persons <br>
scientific beliefs can be just as dogmatic as someone's religious ones.  <br>
Please take the time to read R.A.W.'s "The New Inquisition" for a <br>
scathing expose on the widespread dogma found in the scientific <br>
commnunity.<br>
   I also recommend a psychedelic drug experience of your choice, if you <br>
feel your ready for such a thing.<br>
<p>
Warm Regards,<br>
