<i>&gt;I don't think it is possible or desirable to remove this accumulation</i><br>
<i>&gt;of experiences into personal growth, but it seems to me that at</i><br>
<i>&gt;present we have not attempted to support it. Some people (IMHO far</i><br>
<i>&gt;too few) seek out experiences since they know they will grow from</i><br>
<i>&gt;them (this was one of the reasons I started with ninjutsu), but we do</i><br>
<i>&gt;not yet have a "science/art of personal growth". This is what I want</i><br>
<i>&gt;to look into.</i><br>
<p>
Thanks for clarifying.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[...] Is there really no better way than to experience painful</i><br>
<i>&gt;loss to develop a more mature worldview, a lesson which ought to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;among the earliest for a long lived transhuman? In what ways can we</i><br>
<i>&gt;make the personal growth and maturation process more efficient, less</i><br>
<i>&gt;painful and more transhuman?</i><br>
<p>
We *do* have a "science/art of personal growth".  Any time anyone gives<br>
anyone else an idea about how to grow or learn, that's an example of it.<br>
Storytelling, books, personal conversation, art, performance, workshops...<br>
There are all sorts of communication that are either intended to be growth<br>
experiences in themselves or tell you how to have growth experiences.<br>
Addressing your example, there are all kinds of stories intending to show<br>
what happens when someone is too naive.  A review of a book or a<br>
report about a trip to a beautiful place, or other great experience, would<br>
be an example of indirect growth information.<br>
<p>
I think the meta-problem, though, is that we don't all agree on what<br>
the most useful experiences are.  So, you have a range of choice between<br>
being a tyrant (say as a parent or teacher or cult leader) organizing the<br>
experience of people under your control, or letting people (say children)<br>
make their own choices among experiences given suggestions from you and<br>
others.  And for yourself you have a choice of how much to put yourself<br>
into someone else's hands.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From my point of view, what's wrong is the idea of school.  It's a</i><br>
predefined program that everyone is supposed to progress through, and<br>
either because it's a bad idea from the start, or because it's just been<br>
badly executed, it just comes to seem a rigamarole, a dues-paying,<br>
a torture, an irrelevance, etc.  A sweaty *course*.  Think of all the<br>
Schools of Education, all the people with PhD's in Education.  Yeah,<br>
we have a science of personal growth--a whole crock of it!<br>
<p>
So because things are *too* organized, they end up being and seeming<br>
*not* organized.  If we faced the need for people to organize their<br>
own lives and experiences,(instead of having them organized for them)<br>
maybe we'd be more humble and produce better information and ideas about<br>
how to learn.  (And it might *seem* more like the society around us knew<br>
something about learning (instead of trusting the teacher-experts).)<br>
<p>
Life is necessarily more a kit than a course.  People do<br>
produce good information, experiences, guides and ways of stringing<br>
it all together, but (I think) you have to realize the need to choose<br>
not only your own experiences, but even the purposes your experiences<br>
are supposed to prepare you for.  When you look at it from that point<br>
of view, it's almost amazing that anyone can say anything significant<br>
to anyone else.  So then you can better appreciate the learning<br>
materials that are out there!-)  Although I agree there's room for<br>
improvement.<br>
<p>
Lately I've been learning to shed a deep assumption that's held me<br>
back for a long time: a feeling that there was a key, a path, and<br>
if only I would follow it, I'd be okay.  It would just be a matter of<br>
applying myself.  Only this key was somehow being kept from me.  So<br>
I was being denied my rightful glory!  Watch that kind of trap!<br>
<p>
I lost the Gertrude Stein quote, something like:<br>
  "There ain't no way.  Never was, never will be, and<br>
   the closest we'll ever get to a way is the idea that there ain't one."<br>
