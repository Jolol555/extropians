This has definitely gotten to the level of being a dispute about<br>
semantics (which is not necessarily a bad thing), but I personally<br>
do not choose to use the word "promise" to designate something that<br>
restricts self-ownership or autonomy. (Or perhaps I should say that<br>
I choose not to use the words "self-ownership" and "autonomy" to<br>
designate something that is restricted by promises.) A promise<br>
restricts future action, it reduces degrees of freedom, but I do<br>
not leap forward from that point to say that it reduces autonomy<br>
or surrenders self-ownership. Promises and contracts can be broken,<br>
after all, if one is willing to pay the cost to ones reputation.<br>

<i> &gt; If so, maybe I should start by asking how, in your estimation, a</i><br>
<i> &gt; social contract may avoid the label "government."</i><br>
<p>
In this technical sense of "social contract", the Friedman model<br>
as I understand it has none. Only private contracts are called for.<br>
A Friedmanesque system of private arbitration and security contracts<br>
avoids the label "government" by failing to be a social contract<br>
as Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau used the phrase.  (Although I must<br>
confess that I am actually more familiar with the Lockean theories<br>
of Nozick and Gauthier than with the above three. But Gauthier is<br>
a fan of Hobbes and Rousseau also)<br>
<p>
I don't think social contracts are real. IMHO, the best explanation<br>
of how the current political situation on this planet got to be<br>
this way is provided by Hayek, and I don't think he ever uses the<br>
phrase "social contract", except possibly to criticize it. As far<br>
as I'm concerned, governments are not social contracts: rather,<br>
they are legitimized (that is, popularly accepted by default, not<br>
"legitimate", which to me would mean receiving the active consent<br>
of the governed--a signed contract--and not just default birthright<br>
"consent") protection rackets, the same sort of thing as the Mafia,<br>
only more popular. (This is not a damnation of the government...<br>
in my opinion most of the revenue-generating activities of the<br>
Mafia ought to be legal, and I suspect it's only because of the<br>
illegality of their core businesses that they must, er, "police"<br>
themselves so heavily.)<br>
<p>
I guess after blathering about this stuff so much, I should<br>
point out that in matters of legal theory and legal philosophy I<br>
am strictly an amateur. (As if you couldn't have guessed.  ;)<br>
