<i>&gt; here is also a very good site on sacred geometry: www.danwinter.com/</i><br>
<p>
The question is: what is it good for? <br>
<p>
I once wrote a semi-serious text about the occult significance of the<br>
five platonic polyhedra, the archimedian polyhedra and the simple groups.<br>
I based it on some fun analogies (4 sides of a tetrahedron = 4 elements,<br>
INRI = the Klein 4-group) and then developed them. No stringency, no<br>
real logic, I just went with my feelings and invented connections where<br>
I wanted. Then I published it on alt.magick - and got a lot of encouraging<br>
responces. Many people actually thought I had come up with something<br>
worthwhile, and this disturbed me. I could have written almost anything,<br>
and it would have made sense to them! <br>
<p>
The sacred geometry site you mention is just this kind of analogous,<br>
nice non-reasoning. Beautiful symbols (I really appreciate the beauty<br>
of geometry), vague analogies with no need for proofs or confirmation.<br>
It really doesn't lead anywhere but gives a nice, cozy feeling. It<br>
is muzak for the brain! Compare this to the zometool pages, which<br>
provide a tool for real exploration and contains real mathematical<br>
relations; this is the road to real self growth.<br>
