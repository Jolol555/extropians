Recently I was cleaning my hard drive at home from old junk when I<br>
found an archive of my father's files. He died three years ago (he<br>
definitely fell in the category of people who are content with dying,<br>
being a victim of multiple sclerosis), and I had archived his files<br>
shortly afterwards. In some sense they remain a record of his mind<br>
and interests, very incomplete but still clearly his. I didn't erase<br>
the archive, and put it back in my own long-term archive.<br>
<p>
Maybe this is an interesting alternative to death as total<br>
information-loss, death as merely the end of active change. As we<br>
die, we allow ourselves and out exoselves to be archived (as a whole<br>
or partially) for future study, reference or use. In some sense the<br>
dead are already in this state, archeologists and paleontologists are<br>
definitely getting information from them. <br>
