     Peter McCluskey asked:<br>
     <br>
      Is there any evidence that filtering water is important?<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     I would have to research it for you, which I haven't currently the <br>
     time for but I have read in a number of articles and discussed with <br>
     many environmentally-leaning individuals that our drinking/bathing <br>
     water is continuing to be bombarded with a number of contaminates that <br>
     are not adequately fitered out by the municipal authorities.  <br>
     Considering all humans are is water and minerals, I make the effort to <br>
     heighten the quality as much as possible.  I rather doubt that the <br>
     multi-billion dollar bottled water and purification system market <br>
     emerged completely on a fear meme (if so, bravo to the marketing <br>
     people who did that one!).<br>
     <br>
     Of course, those interests pushing the filtration and bottled water <br>
     always have the compelling spin but I'd advise checking with local <br>
     environmental groups and obtaining a copy of the water quality reports <br>
     that your municipal water provider has to make public.<br>
     <br>
     In my estimation, average municipal water quality, governed by a <br>
     bogged down and likely indifferent bureaucratic system is about as <br>
     safe as packaged meat...but we'll save that for another topic &lt;G&gt;.<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
