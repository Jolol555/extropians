 That machine seemed very cool to me too. I asked the director of my health<br>
 center about it or anything like it, and she said that she goes to all the<br>
 conventions and seminars and so forth and has never seen anything like it.<br>
 But I decided I wanted to get it anyway and tried to find their website. It<br>
 didn't exist under anything like the name they mentioned, so I gave up on<br>
 it. But I look forward to a "flying" machine like this becoming available.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
I wish I had paid closer attention....but Tv generally annoys me...so I<br>
didn't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From what I recall...the machine was basically an "H" frame with "legs" or</i><br>
"stirrups" hanging down into which you stand...there are hand grips which are<br>
crossconnected to the stirrups...stnd in stirrups...cross of "H" at<br>
waist....the net effect is a stifflegged stride...reminescent of crosscountry<br>
skiing or skating...arms alternating with legs.. zero impact was<br>
claimed....apparently resistannce may be increased...something similar to a<br>
brake pad?<br>
<p>
I'm sure it was something fllyer...although the web site was the name of the<br>
company..not the product...and it was nothing like that...but it was in<br>
California.<br>
<p>
I haven't had a chance to connect to the web since....had expected to locate<br>
it ...now  I'm not so sure.<br>
