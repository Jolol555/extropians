In the August 21 1997 issue of Nature there is an article by Virginia K Walker <br>
and Peter L Davies about proteins found in insects that act as natural <br>
antifreeze. Protein antifreeze has been found before, in fish, but the one <br>
discovered in the budworm is 30 times as potent, and you'd need 100 times as <br>
much fish antifreeze to work as well as the one found in the mealworm. <br>
Both these new proteins are similar in that they have lots of repetitions of <br>
water loving amino acids like serine, threonine, cysteine and glycine. <br>
It's suspected that their structure is similar to that of water molecules in <br>
ice so the two fit together, at lest  that's what the fish protein does,<br>
but the 3 dimensional shape of any of  the insect ones has not been found yet <br>
so maybe they work some other way.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately they only lower the freezing point of water by 5.5 degrees <br>
centigrade and that's not enough to preserve things for more than a month or <br>
two, but there may be other advantages. When things get really cold and ice <br>
does form it's as smooth hexagonal disks, not dangerous sharp edges and <br>
pointy spikes which is what you get without any antifreeze or even if you  <br>
use the one from fish. <br>
<p>
I wonder if this be of use in Cryonics. So far only very small amounts have <br>
been produced, but if anybody thought it was worth the bother I'm sure the <br>
gene that codes for the protein could be found and spliced into a bacteria or <br>
yeast and you could crank it out by  the ton. Just a thought.<br>
