Dear Michael and other fellow Extropians,<br>
<p>
This dialogue, although quite enjoyable, seems to be going off on tangents<br>
of the hypothetical extremes. This is not that bad, nor is it that good.<br>
<p>
I suspect, however, that some of us -- myself included -- might be getting<br>
too emotionally involved and loosing our objectivity on the issue of gun<br>
control by becoming involved in somewhat questionable exegesis.<br>
<p>
Possibly, we should further consider what is in the best interest of the<br>
continuing  evolution of humankind and its cultures. We should consider in<br>
this context the need for greater altruism in an enhanced humanistic<br>
environment. <br>
<p>
The political context of our dialogue as well should be strongly<br>
considered if we are to believe that we are all capable of care and<br>
concern for our fellow humans and respectful of their their right to seek<br>
individual freedoms without the imposition of their personal constraints<br>
and and other emotional burdens on other members of society.<br>
<p>
Quo Vadis?<br>
<p>
A.M. Genen<br>
