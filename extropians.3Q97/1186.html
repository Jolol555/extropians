<i>&gt;I would not say that they 'want' to hide the fact of the</i><br>

<p>
Yes, but why?  "Want" is just a shorthand.  The question is, *why*, in<br>
your opinion, it's in the interests of "social institutions" (and, as Robin<br>
points out, you seem to mean *all* of them--baseball, trade, the word<br>
"the," etc.) to conceal rather than reveal their own constructions?   Why<br>
don't they benefit by being up-front and above-board instead?  Why<br>
don't they benefit by actively *encouraging* exploration of and challenge<br>
to their constructions?  Isn't criticism helpful?  Isn't openness good<br>
publicity?  At least in some cases?<br>
<p>
Think about the analogy to human beings.  It's like saying, "No one<br>
benefits by having their personna examined or criticized."  You don't<br>
think that's true do you?  So why are social institutions different?<br>
