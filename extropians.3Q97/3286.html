Thank you for your posts and letters about this issue, which have helped me<br>
get over the extreme embarrassment and self-hatred which overwhelmed me<br>
when I was so recently what we in the anthropological world call 'a big<br>
jerk'. (It's a phrase from the inidigenous population of the Polynesian<br>
Islands, I believe.)<br>
<p>
Coincidentally I will have to unsubscribe for a few days over the next<br>
fortnight, because I'm moving to the US for eight months, and will have a<br>
period of being unable to collect email. But apart from that, I shall keep<br>
reading and posting.<br>
<p>
Besides, I have to stay around because I need someone to explain to me why<br>
extreme space-time curvature within the event horizon of a black hole<br>
should lead to the tearing apart of a body of matter, when, within the<br>
reference frame of that body, space-time is not distorted, since it cannot<br>
be considered in relation to any other version of otherwise distorted<br>
space-time. And similar things. Like, why does the temperature of my shower<br>
always change from perfect to boiling or freezing the moment I step under it?<br>
<p>
