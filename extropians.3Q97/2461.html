<p>
Well, as long as there exist a chemical compound with a higher <br>
binding energy than the components have in naturally occuring rock, <br>
doesn't this mean that the reaction would be *exotherm* so that the <br>
only energy we will need is for start-up. And even if each digestive <br>
cycle were to take a longer time than for organic substances, this <br>
would not matter much since we are dealing with a exponetially <br>
increasing number of parallel processes. --This is a question to <br>
which we should be able to have a scientific answer already today.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; infection, and be quite deadly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Why couldn't it spread much faster? Bacteria are limited to some </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; specifid kinds of hosts, the nanites could attack any organic </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; material and many inorganic ones too.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I based this on Drexler's calculations of replication. Bacteria are</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually quite good replicators, thermodynamics seems to place some</i><br>
<i>&gt; limits to replication speed at a certain energy level (and you cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; get much more than 1000 W/m^2 on the surface of the earth). </i><br>
<p>
There are two separate issues here. Your first statement was meant to <br>
support your claim that we could hide away from bad nanites, so I <br>
assumed you refered to the actual speed of a bacterial infections. <br>
Your last statement says somthing not about the actual speed of <br>
bacterial infections, but about the speed of a bacterial infection in <br>
ideal circumstances --continuous medium, unlimited food etc. I might <br>
agree that in those circumstances there might not be much difference <br>
between a nano-plague and a biological plague; but what we are <br>
talking about is the real world, and therein bacteria are quite bad <br>
replicators in the sense that a new strand of bacteria won't cover <br>
the whole earth in a matter of hours. What are the Drexlerian <br>
calculations you refer to?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; And if they were deliberately designed, they could transform</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; themself to missiles after they had eaten enough, and then swoosh</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; accross the seven sees in a very short time. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, yes. But I'm trying to discuss the immune system problem here,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not the deliberate weapons use problem (as I pointed out in my last</i><br>
<i>&gt; posting). </i><br>
<p>
The immune system problem is part of the deliberate weapons use <br>
problem. We want an immune system that can make us safe from a <br>
Saddam Hussein with nanotech. If we were certain that everybody would <br>
use nanotech in a peaceful and responsible way then we would not need <br>
to care much about the immune problem. E. g. we could simply design <br>
all the nanomachines to be non-evolvable. (This is done by building <br>
them in such a way that any single one or a few mutations would lead <br>
to a non-viable machine; only a cosmic coincidence would yield <br>
something that can reproduce.) So I'm not sure about which problem <br>
your are trying to solve.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; to have the immune system quickly eliminating any </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; plagues, and it could use the fact that it has access to more energy. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A good design for this?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have been working on a system, but it is not yet written up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Basically, it will depend on what you want to defend. </i><br>
<p>
I'm looking forward to reading about it; can you give us a spoiler?. <br>
Is it supposed to work against designed plagues also?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Aha, I just thought of a third way. The independent folks could all </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; live in a virtual reality that were designed so they could do no </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; major harm. They would have no access to the real reality, which </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would be ruled by a single entity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And how do you trust the independents to not figure out how to</i><br>
<i>&gt; subvert reality in some way, or the entity to wield its power well?</i><br>
<p>
My original remark was only about a possibility: if we are lucky, the <br>
entity would benevolent and then this could work. However, now <br>
when I come to think about it, it might be possible to have a stable <br>
postnanotech libertarian society after all, contrary to what I <br>
previously believed. Here is my idea:<br>
<p>
Safe Libertarian Future:<br>
The scenario assumes that many humans value freedom and independent <br>
personal existence higher than anything else. When nanotechnology <br>
approaches, they realise that if freedom is allowed in a world with <br>
strong nanotech, then some mad person will certainly design the <br>
doomsday virus. So they realise they have to give up on freedom. But <br>
then some bright person comes up with the idea that all people upload <br>
and that only a robot is left with the ability to operate in the real <br>
world. The whole system is hardwired so that the robot only executes <br>
instructions that have been agreed upon by the majority of the <br>
uploads. In their virtual reality, the uploads can do anything they <br>
want: each one has unlimited individual freedom. The only thing they <br>
can't do in the virtual reality is to mass murder a lot of other <br>
uploads (the virtual physics doesn't allow destructive nanomachines <br>
to be built, for example). The uploads cannot influence the external <br>
world either, except when a majority decision can be made. But for <br>
many decisions, this should be feasible: e.g. colonising the galaxy <br>
to provide more Lebensraum etc. One can even imagine refinements of <br>
this scheme such that each individual would have his own robot that <br>
he could to what he liked with; though this presupposes that the <br>
robots could be built in such a way that nobody could use their robot <br>
to do anything that would endanger the computer on which they all <br>
existed.<br>
<p>
This is the only way I can think of that a very nearly <br>
completely libertarian society, without any guardian or international <br>
government, can exist long after the arrival of strong nanotech.<br>
