<i> &gt;Yes, I've heard it argued that the Holocaust was merely one in a long string</i><br>

couple<br>

<p>
What do you think was done to several million Kossacks in Siberia? What do<br>
you think happened to several million Chinese used for Bio-war testing by<br>
the Japanese in WW-II?<br>
Among those 11 million were my grandparents so yes, I too can get a bit<br>
emotional when this comes up (not that I ever knew them, being born in 1972<br>
- but they were family). In spite of this I do not believe there's no<br>
fundamental difference. Except that it happened 'on our doorstep'.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Are the survivors of Chad, Somalia, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ceylon,</i><br>
<i> &gt;Birma as scarred mentally as the survivors of the Holocaust were? Some</i><br>
<i> &gt;Holocaust survivors still sleep with a loaf of bread at night.</i><br>
<p>
Go to the video store and hire "The killing fields".<br>
Watch it 3 or 4 times, then tell me what you think.<br>
Make sure you have someone nearby to discuss it with.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The Nazis took genocide to a new level, not in numbers, </i><br>
<i> &gt;but in cold-blooded cruelty.</i><br>
<p>
Again, in spite of my own emotional involvement, I can't see the difference<br>
between the horrors of '39-'45 and the terrible things that happened in<br>
various communist country's right up to this moment (China - N-korea).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I wouldn't argue with anyone who called Chad, Cambodia, or a crack ghetto a</i><br>
<i> &gt;"continuing Holocaust".  Far from mocking the dead, this would prevent</i><br>
similar<br>
<i> &gt;tragedies.  Nor would I argue if someone wanted to add a fourth floor to the</i><br>
<i> &gt;Holocaust exhibition, documenting ongoing genocides around the world.</i><br>
<p>
Now, there's a good, contructive, idea! This is an Exibition in the US? or<br>
somewhere else?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;But, as human history demonstrates, genocide was once as fashionable as</i><br>
<i> &gt;theories of racial superiority. If not for the Holocaust, we might today</i><br>
<i> &gt;cheerfully dismiss Chad and Cambodia as the extinction of vermin. </i><br>
<p>
I sure as hell would not!<br>
And I can only hope that you would not either, you're much to smart to such<br>
a thing anyway.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;By</i><br>
<i> &gt;associating something not instinctively abhorrent, genocide, with something</i><br>
<i> &gt;that is instinctively abhorrent, torture, the Holocaust made genocide as</i><br>
<i> &gt;unfashionable as theories of racial superiority.</i><br>
<p>
Both may be unfashionable in your neighborhood, racial theories still kill,<br>
asks any Rwandese genocide victim. this happened just a few years ago! in<br>
the nineties! It's not over folks, it's just not being covered so extensively.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;But, speaking as a</i><br>
<i> &gt;human, we are simply not sensitive to the deaths of people we don't know.</i><br>
<i> &gt;It provokes no instinctive reaction in us. </i><br>
<p>
I'm sorry here we have a most serious disagreement (*most* serious).<br>
But maybe you've never seen someone die. I hope you won't ever have to,<br>
even though it is quite a learning experience (beats years of university,<br>
hand down)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Suffering, on the other hand,</i><br>
<i> &gt;provokes compassion and anger. And the Nazis systematically inflicted the</i><br>
<i> &gt;greatest density of suffering ever seen in human history. </i><br>
<p>
What is the basis for this last statement? There is no way to measure human<br>
suffering, Can you imagine a thousand bodies? So how do you imagine the<br>
difference between 11 million gassed/starved nazi-victims to unknown<br>
millions of chinese farmers that worked themselves to deah to bring about<br>
Mao's 'Great Leap Forward'. Both are simply 'unimaginable'.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The Holocaust</i><br>
<i> &gt;surpasses our capabilities of compassion and anger. Perhaps any genocide</i><br>
<i> &gt;should. But we cannot grasp a genocide directly; we can only read reports of</i><br>
<i> &gt;it. The Holocaust stands alone in that even the reports and the pictures are</i><br>
<i> &gt;enough to overload our responses.</i><br>
<p>
I appreciate that the exibition shocked the hell out of you, that is not a<br>
bad thing, it merely shows you're human (Sorry Anders).<br>
Maybe I'm different but those images have not 'overloaded' my responses<br>
since I was ten. Seeing the UN do nothing for several years whilst women<br>
and children were being shelled with artillery got me pretty pissed though.<br>
Seeing a little boy die from sniperfire (no not on TV!) damm-near did the job.<br>
<p>
Eliezer, in other coutry's persons you're age are seasoned veterans of some<br>
pointless civil-war, they have *done* the kind of things you get overloaded<br>
by just looking at pictures of them.<br>
<p>
Read some contemporary history, and hold-on to someone you love while<br>
you're at it. It helps.<br>
<p>
Sorry for this rant, and sorry if I seem to be a cold-blooded son-of-bitch.<br>
It's just a protective mechanism. <br>
I need a drink.<br>
