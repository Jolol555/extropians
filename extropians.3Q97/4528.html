<i>&gt; The key difference lies not in the richness of the pictures, nor in the</i><br>

<i>&gt; vast number of different *scenes* can be (and regularly are) thrown at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain.  Humans are used to, say, watching the high speed chase of a lion</i><br>
<i>&gt; running down a wildebeest.  Fine.  But TV lets you watch, say, a sprinting</i><br>
<i>&gt; lion, then a sprinting wildebeest, then the legs of each, then a passing</i><br>
<i>&gt; car, then an airplane, then a flock of birds, then the narrowing iris of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; human eye, then an explosion, then a view of the earth from space, then a</i><br>
<i>&gt; shot of a human sitting on a couch looking at all of this, all in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; timeframe that is *amazingly* short (on the order of a couple of seconds).</i><br>
<p>
This is true, but of course television has only been available since the<br>
1950s, while the Flynn effect goes back at least a decade and probably<br>
several decades before that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you want an even better example, rent pretty much any Zucker Brothers</i><br>
<i>&gt; Movie (Hot Shots: Deux, for instance) and any Mel Brooks movie (Robin Hood:</i><br>
<i>&gt; Men in Tights, for instance), and then watch first the Zucker Brothers</i><br>
<i>&gt; movie, followed by the Brooks movie.  I guarantee that you will feel the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Brooks movie to be interminably slow, with punchlines coming at you only</i><br>
<i>&gt; once every minute or so, rather than every few seconds, as in the Zucker</i><br>
<i>&gt; Brothers movie.</i><br>
<p>
That's an interesting point.  You're suggesting that Brooks, an old man,<br>
is putting out imagery at a pace which is comfortable for him, while the<br>
Zuckers, who are relatively young, are using the faster pacing more<br>
typical of their generation.  I wonder if this difference can be observed<br>
in the works of other directors.<br>
<p>
I think you're right that TV pacing has picked up over the years.  One of<br>
the complaints older people make about music videos is that they cut too<br>
quickly to see what's going on.  Is this the cause though or an effect<br>
of the Flynn changes?<br>
<p>
Another problem oldsters have with MTV is that the videos are too<br>
abstract, too ambiguous, too confusing.  Younger people can handle this,<br>
and although they may not always know what the videos are about either,<br>
they are comfortable with the ambiguity.  They can adopt a mental stance<br>
where they are accepting the imagery and taking value from it, without<br>
trying to judge, categorize, or pigeonhole it.<br>
<p>
I believe this kind of change is also a cause/manifestation of the Flynn<br>
effect.  It represents an increase in mental flexibility and independent<br>
thinking.  We have seen a trend for centuries away from the inflexible,<br>
autocratic, unthinking social systems of the past, towards a world where<br>
people are exposed to many more new ideas as well as new images.<br>
<p>
All the time people (mostly older) are complaining that they have to think<br>
about things that used to be taken for granted.  Back in the 1970s the<br>
watergate scandal was a real shock to the older generation.  Today it is<br>
hard to imagine/remember why people would have been so surprised to learn<br>
that their leaders were imperfect and even morally subpar.  We see that the<br>
structure of the political system invites cheating in order to achieve<br>
political success.  But most people did not think in those terms back<br>
then.  They just assumed, because that is what they had been taught, that<br>
their leaders would have sterling morals.  Watergate meant that they<br>
would have to actively think about and evaluate each leader as to his<br>
individual moral character.  The problem becomes much more difficult.<br>
<p>
We've also seen the same kind of complaints about relationships between<br>
the sexes.  At one time social relations were rigidly structured.<br>
Men had one role, women another.  But throughout this century this<br>
structure has weakened, with new kinds of relationships developing.<br>
Today we have dozens of different possible kinds of relationships, people<br>
adopt ambiguous sexual roles, some men and women want a more old-fashioned<br>
partner, others want to experiment.  You can't know what to expect from<br>
a person until you really get to know them.  As with the other changes,<br>
it's a more difficult task, more demanding mentally.  People complain,<br>
but they adapt.<br>
<p>
You can come up with dozens of other examples.  At one time people's<br>
work lives were determined by their family.  Today they must make their<br>
own choices.  At one time our responsibilities and roles with regard<br>
to child raising were given.  Today they must be decided.  At one time<br>
relations to others in the workplace were fixed by position and rank.<br>
Today the boss may dress like the workers and expect to be treated much<br>
like everyone else - while at the same time expecting subtle deference.<br>
At one time art was mostly representational.  Then came abstraction, and<br>
today virtually anything can be called art - it's more a matter of<br>
intention than product.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Probably, (wild speculation here), this trend can be traced back to before</i><br>
<i>&gt; the advent of television.  Emerging forms of media have allowed us to speed</i><br>
<i>&gt; up and vary our brain input in many ways, if you think about it.  Wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; you expect this training to have some effect on our intelligence?</i><br>
<p>
The real question is whether the increases measured by the Flynn effect<br>
reflect what we normally think of as intelligence.  Without actually being<br>
able to visit and interact with an average person of 50 or 100 years ago,<br>
it is hard to judge.  What we can do is talk with people who were young 50<br>
years ago, today's 60 year olds.  They have lower IQs than young people,<br>
and IMO lack the kinds of mental flexibility that I've been describing.<br>
According to the SciAm article, their IQ may not actually have dropped<br>
with age, but rather low IQs (by today's measurements) were normal when<br>
they were young.<br>
