     And how can we stop a child's parents from imprinting dogmatic views?  <br>
     Children are an important part of progress, and some of the thing's <br>
     parents find wrong are the very things that aid that progress.<br>

     <br>
     In my previous tidy scenario on the subject (conveniently limited to <br>
     "extropian" minded parents), I didn't factor in such a situation.  If <br>
     my parents had sent me to a small "church" school and been real <br>
     adamant about it, it would've been quite different from the sometimes <br>
     carefree nature of public school with its art, dancing and overall <br>
     diversity to observe and participate in.  My daughter pretty much had <br>
     that route in elementary and middle school.  Unfortunately, she was <br>
     very intelligent and hated public high school even though she wanted <br>
     the freedom it afforded.  She found it too big, the people too nominal <br>
     in their quest for learning and the tools for learning too limited <br>
     (schools not well-funded).  So it was the other end of the spectrum <br>
     for her.  Sure there were dances but the number of kids to DEAL with <br>
     was overwhelming.  She tested out of high school at 14 (there's a <br>
     happy ending, she did go to the senior prom &lt;G&gt;).  <br>
     <br>
     Point is, kids adjust to what they need to.  My daughter is very adept <br>
     at debate and negotiation (BELIEVE ME!) and she got that skill from <br>
     observing her mother (the lawyer!) who she lived with thru age 12.  <br>
     However, on the minus side, she doesn't socialize all that well when <br>
     put in large groups.  She's used to managing/leading smaller, tamer <br>
     groups of people.  Hindrance or preference?<br>
     <br>
