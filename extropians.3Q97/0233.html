<i>&gt; Well, I've been trying to look into this, although I'm hampered by my lack</i><br>
<i>&gt; of expertise in astrophysics. The Solar system formed about five billion</i><br>
<i>&gt; years ago. One of the reasons that life could form here is that the cloud</i><br>

<i>&gt; Bang (if that's what happened) produced only hydrogen and helium, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; happened only some seven to thirteen billion years before the formation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Solar system. It would take a certain amount of time for enough large</i><br>
<i>&gt; stars to form and go supernova to enrich the interstellar clouds of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; galaxy with the oxygen and carbon that were available at the time the Solar</i><br>
<i>&gt; system formed. When I try to answer the question "How much time at a</i><br>
<i>&gt; minimum would be required to form and disperse the necessary amount of</i><br>
<i>&gt; heavier elements?" I find I get led into astrophysics textbooks and papers</i><br>
<i>&gt; that are too hairy for me to understand without devoting a lot of time to</i><br>
<i>&gt; it, and they don't present "the Answer" to this question in the abstracts</i><br>
<i>&gt; or conclusions from which a layperson could easily grab it. </i><br>
<p>
I'm not an astrophysicist either (but I do play one on the Net :-),<br>
but here are some rough guesstimates:<br>
<p>
Colonizing the galaxy can be done in less than 10 million years using<br>
von Neumann probes (see Tipler &amp; Barrow, the Anthropic Cosmological<br>
Principle for a discussion of this). <br>
<p>
The solar system is around 5 billion years old. Life has existed for<br>
(say) 4 billion years. Even if we assume our solar system is one of<br>
the oldest generation I systems in existence, I still have the<br>
feeling that the time from the first bacteria to the cambrian<br>
explosion could have been shorter (the explosion was likely due to<br>
one or more "tricks" like predation and multicellularity which were<br>
slightly unlikely but could have happened much earlier). The same<br>
goes for the emergence of intelligence among the vertebrates: the<br>
oldest vertebrates are around 100 million years old, there is no<br>
strong reason intelligence couldn't have developed much earlier. <br>
<p>
If we assume just a 10% variance, then it is quite possible that life<br>
could have turned metazoan and intelligent several hundred million<br>
years ago on some earth-aged planet. Since interstellar expansion is<br>
so quick they should have arrived here a long time ago. <br>
