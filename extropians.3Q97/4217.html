<p>
Yes, but popularity and truth don't really seem to have very<br>
much correlation.<br>
<p>
Earlier you asserted that knowledge of the white dwarf Sirius B<br>
went back thousands of years among the Dogon.  This is the part<br>
of your claim that I take issue with.  When was it discovered<br>
that the Dogon had this knowledge?  Who was the first non-Dogon<br>
to publish about this knowledge, and when?  Were the Dogons a<br>
literate people or was knowledge of Sirius's pup transmitted in<br>
an oral tradition?  If it was transmitted in an oral tradition,<br>
then what is the evidence that the knowledge is as old among<br>
the Dogon as claimed?<br>
<p>
These questions matter because Europeans discovered Sirius's<br>
pup late in the 19th century, and at the time of discovery,<br>
this would have been widely discussed by scientifically-curious<br>
literate people worldwide, not just astronomers.  Knowledge of<br>
the white dwarf companion might have come to the Dogon at this<br>
time, shortly after the discovery by the Europeans, and been<br>
"rediscovered" among the Dogon by some cultural anthropologist<br>
at few decades later.<br>
<p>
I don't know whether the claim about the Dogon is true, but I<br>
do know what sort of information I'd need to see a lot more of<br>
before I'd take this claim at face value.  Where do these<br>
claims originate in the literature? is always a good start.<br>
