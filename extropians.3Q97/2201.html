Yes, but you have to include our belief that this strangeness will be <br>
brought aboutmainly  by technology, otherwise all religious and <br>
environmentalist doomsday sects would fall in the same category. One <br>
could say: Transhumanism is the doctrine that new technologies will <br>
make the world extremely different soon.<br>

<i>&gt; Lots of people seem to sorta believe in a strange future, yet seem</i><br>
<i>&gt; unwillling or unable to actually take the time to think seriously</i><br>
<i>&gt; about it. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But I wonder:  is there any smart person out there who understands the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sorts of arguements that lead us to expect strangeness, and yet who</i><br>
<i>&gt; disagrees with our conclusion?  </i><br>
<p>
I can't think of any.<br>
