An alternative formulation may be in order:<br>
   Why did older cultures quit advancing?<br>
<p>
   Egypt had a high culture that apparently included the study of<br>
mathematics, geometry, and at least some astronomy, chemistry,<br>
and physics. Why did this culture stagnate?<br>
    India had a Rich culture with an apparent emphais on<br>
scholarship.Why did this culture fail to progress?<br>
     China's culture was far in advance of Greco-Roman<br>
culture in many ways. What happened?<br>
    Arab culture was far in advence of early midieval culture<br>
in astronomy and mathematics.<br>
    Japanese culture elected to turn its back on the west for<br>
250 years.<br>
<p>
OK, what about this theory? There are many examples of cultures<br>
that apparently quit progressing, with no clear underlying<br>
common reason. Eventually, one culture got to the "rational<br>
breakthrough" and learned the scientific method. It could have<br>
been any culture. Whatever culture got there first would have<br>
taken over the world by spreading this method. The "West" just<br>
happened to be first.<br>
