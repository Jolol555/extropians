<i>&gt; mission against their will.</i><br>
<p>
Hey, I'm being made to pay for a War on Drugs I don't approve of, yet if<br>
I protested, I'd get arrested.<br>
I'm being made to pay for the research to find a "cure" for AIDS, when a<br>
good supply of vitamins, rubbers, spermicide, and an aversion to anal<br>
sex should do the job of prevention much better and more cheaply for all<br>
practical purposes.<br>
I'm being made to pay for a welfare system that anyone but a single<br>
white straight educated male can get benefits from (I know, I tried<br>
several times when I was down on my luck to seek the "help" that freinds<br>
said I "deserved" and was "entitled to").<br>
I'm being made to pay for research into and measures to reduce the<br>
"greenhouse affect" that as far as anyone can tell isn't now and won't<br>
anytime in the near future centuries be anywhere near the outside bounds<br>
of normal terran climate variation. For all we know, our pollution is<br>
protecting us from an ice age right now, and we don't even know it. The<br>
solar flux and atmospheric data support this theory as much as they<br>
support the theory that manmade pollution is causing a "greenhouse<br>
effect".<br>
The two things I want the overwhelming majority of my tax money to go<br>
to: space exploration and space technology/ifrastructure development are<br>
extremely atrophied. <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I accept as a given that if Cassini provides any data at all, it will</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefit the human race.  However, although governments are good at quick</i><br>
<i>&gt; and dirty projects and sometimes fund useful science, for the most part</i><br>
<i>&gt; politics governs decisions.  Science, by its nature, must be free and open</i><br>
<i>&gt; but even the most benign government bureaucracies tend toward their</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposite.  "Big" science as practiced by government bureaucracies is</i><br>
<i>&gt; wasteful and inflexible.  It is true that planetary exploration is</i><br>
<i>&gt; CURRENTLY expensive and it APPEARS that only a government can fund it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But, if there is ever going to be an expansion of humanity beyond the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Earth, we will have to get the government out of the picture -- market</i><br>
<i>&gt; forces will yield solutions that will reduce costs and open up</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibilities for exploration and exploitation that will dwarf anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; that government bureaucracies are likely to produce.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So, the Cassini opponents, in their neo-Luddite way, actually have an</i><br>
<i>&gt; important point to make and it behooves us to give it due consideration.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think the issue should be how government can effectively privatize space</i><br>
<i>&gt; -- in other words, how quickly government can get out of the picture.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
True, but government should not get totally out of the picture until the<br>
technological and infrastructure base is sufficient to be economical,<br>
with growth, not just self sufficiency.<br>
<p>
As seen in other posts on this subject, the human race is far far more<br>
risk averse than they were back in the age of exploration, or even in<br>
the earlier part of this century.<br>
