Dear fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
Despite Mr. Sherwood's doubts and reservations, (listed below) I think<br>
that if any of you went beyond the superficiality of the media reports and<br>
did a substantive personal investigation into the mechanics of a board of<br>
elections, I suspect you'll find that there are more than adequate legal<br>
and administrative mechanisms to prevent election fraud. <br>
<p>
In most instances I find that loosing candidates are quite quick at<br>
running to the media and screaming fraud without any meaningful proof. The<br>
media, in most of these instances, is rarely, if ever, interested in<br>
spending time gathering evidence. It's simply not worth their time or<br>
effort. <br>
<p>
Besides, most people I've found, have no real interest in the news other<br>
than entertainment.<br>
<p>
Sorry, I'm feeling a bit tired and cynical tonight.<br>
We're going through that same nonsense in the New York City Mayoral<br>
primary at the moment.<br>

Abraham Moses Genen writes<br>
: On the rare occasions when an election becomes the subject of<br>
: media exploitation there will be those who extrapolate the few<br>
: to the majority. There is an obvious falicy in such imaginings.<br>
<p>
On the rare occasions when the establishment can't sweep corruption <br>
under the rug, some of those not indicted can be counted on to dismiss it<br>
on the grounds that "there are a few bad apples in every bushel."<br>
Then, when the press conference is over, they go back to behaving<br>
as if *their* bushel is the exception.<br>
<p>
Such protestations would be more convincing if the establishment<br>
were more proactive (or more visibly proactive) in seeking out<br>
and preventing corruption, rather than denying its existence and<br>
defending the suspects until the evidence gathered *by outsiders*<br>
becomes overwhelming.<br>
<p>
A few years ago Tamara Clark was a Libertarian candidate for the<br>
Nevada Senate.  She came close (there was no serious Republican<br>
candidate), but lost - and found evidence of ballot-stuffing.<br>
The state refused to investigate.  Why?  Why not have occasional<br>
showcase investigations even where there's *no* reason to suspect<br>
fraud, to prove that the system is clean?  If it's a good idea for<br>
the IRS to audit random taxpayers, why not audit random elections?<br>
<p>
The sad fact is that most elections receive little scrutiny,<br>
because most of them can be predicted in advance.  So we really<br>
have no statistical baseline on which to judge how often they are<br>
honest.<br>
<p>
San Francisco's recent stadium election is being scrutinized only<br>
because its results were so surprising: polls showed the proposition<br>
losing, and it won largely thanks to unusually high turnout in,<br>
of all places, a neighborhood believed to be strongly opposed.<br>
If this was fraud, were it done more carefully - spreading the<br>
forged votes around the city - it might never be suspected.<br>
And so it would never be scrutinized.  And so our assumptions<br>
about the honesty of most elections would continue to be based<br>
on absence of evidence.  Thanks to the secret ballot we really<br>
have no idea how many elections are clean, and how many are<br>
more expertly stolen.<br>
<p>
(Did the mayor, having spent the last several years out of town<br>
as Speaker of the Assembly, overestimate the party machine's ability<br>
to get away with it?)<br>
<p>
: No, the system is not totally corrupt. There are some corrupt people<br>
: in almost every organization. What needs to be done is to increase<br>
: our emphasis on ethics.<br>
<p>
The logical answer to the "few bad apples" is to design our systems<br>
with that assumption in mind.  A political system - a monopolistic<br>
system - is a poor solution, because it makes everybody vulnerable<br>
to bad apples.<br>
<p>
Increase our emphasis on ethics?  Let's start by admitting<br>
that plunder is wrong, and that majority vote (even if genuine)<br>
does not make it right.<br>
<p>
: Let's stop spitting on every little thing. It's not really that<br>
: productive.<br>
<p>
Have you got something to hide, citizen?<br>
<p>
The state's raison d'etre is its ability to coerce, to apply the<br>
majority's mandate against the will of the minority, in ways that<br>
would be forbidden for any other entity.  For that reason, its<br>
actions deserve a higher level of scrutiny than private actions.<br>
That's why press freedom is written into the Constitution.<br>
That's why we have two legislative houses (formerly elected in<br>
very different ways), executive veto, and juries (formerly with<br>
the recognized authority to judge law as well as fact).<br>
<p>
We still have, I believe, more effective safeguards on the<br>
procedural honesty of criminal trials than on elections.<br>
(Never mind that juries are sorted to exclude people who<br>
might think for themselves about justice.)  Should we discard<br>
those?  After all, in an election there may be millions of<br>
interested parties; in a criminal trial there are only a few.<br>
<p>
If the state really is mostly clean, as you say, it will endure<br>
the "spitting".  If the results of an election really do reflect<br>
the intent of the people (assuming that there is such a thing as<br>
collective intent), scrutiny will reveal it to be true.  The heckling<br>
and the procedural hurdles are not needless impediments: they are<br>
the acid test by which democracy is distinguished from fraud.<br>
