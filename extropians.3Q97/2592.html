<i>&gt; article and express their thoughts on the matter.</i><br>
<p>
I think the article you mentioned is interesting, but a bit fumbling;<br>
the legal problems of drugs vs. medical products are obvious but<br>
solvable, while the far-future aspects were treated a bit too light-<br>
handedly. Uploading isn't the first thing to worry about once we<br>
have nanotech. <br>
<p>
As I see it, the main legal problem will be that matter has become<br>
as malleable as software, with the acompanying problems of intellectual<br>
property. We still have not solved that problem even today, and it<br>
will likely get worse. How do you get paid for information and ideas,<br>
when they can be copied endlessly? How can you enforce copyrights<br>
on software or physical objects. <br>
<p>
In the long-term future one could imagine a shareware economy, where<br>
creators get paid by others on a voluntary basis; since physical<br>
scarcity has become irrelevant it is no disaster to be uncreative,<br>
you can simply live on the products other design for fun. In this<br>
scenario the software and designs are free, and there is no need<br>
for copyrights. Unfortunately this is very far from our current state, <br>
and might be an unlikely state to end up in.<br>
<p>
Another big problem currently being analysed on the extropians list<br>
is of course how to avoid dangerous nanotech. How do you enforce<br>
that replicators all need a rare, artificial "vitamin" or cannot<br>
replicate in nature (current genetic research seems to manage it)?<br>
What about weapons laws? What is a weapon is largely a matter of<br>
creativity, and with nanotech some weapons might be created just<br>
before use (should we outlaw weapons designs?) or apparently<br>
tame nanotech used as a weapon. Can one distinguish between different<br>
kinds of nanotech, so that one kind can be labeled weapon and another<br>
drug?<br>
<p>
Apropos drugs, even early nanotech can make drug production trivial.<br>
This can have interesting consequences for the War on Drugs, organized<br>
crime (what happens if the junkies can download a freeware design for<br>
heroin?) and for creative neuronauts, who can develop drugs which<br>
are devices (and hence not under the jurisdiction of the DEA in the US?).<br>
Perhaps one could clarify the law, to outlaw all systems that in<br>
some artificial way interface with the pleasure and motivation <br>
centers of the brain (with allowances for medical use).<br>
