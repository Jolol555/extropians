<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What the hell are these nanites living on?! </i><br>
<p>
Sun or chemical binding energy, for example.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Their very life requires</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy, not to mention, as Anders noted, the cost of trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt; concentrate extremely diffuse and oxygen-bonded uranium.</i><br>
<p>
Use dynamite then. But energy wouldn't be a problem.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Solar</i><br>
<i>&gt; collection will take lots of area, be noticeable, and be exposed.  Shade</i><br>
<i>&gt; it, dust it, bomb it.</i><br>
<p>
As I said, if it covers a whole continent you can't do that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And they're not living off of rock.  It's hard to get lower energy</i><br>
<i>&gt; states than found in a lot of rock without using nuclear processes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's why aluminum mining is so expensive.</i><br>
<p>
With nanotech, we might be able to catalyse arbitrary prosesses and <br>
gain energy, as long as there is a net increase in chemical binding <br>
energy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I challenge this "lower division" assumption.  Antibodies can't gum up</i><br>
<i>&gt; the works of nanites; phagocytic cells can't enclose and dissolve them?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hydrogren peroxide and free radicals are popular weapons.  Oxidizing</i><br>
<i>&gt; chemicals vs. small pieces of pure carbon; I bet on the white blood cell.</i><br>
<p>
Of course, nanomachines can do everything biological cells can, since <br>
these are a special kind of nanomachines; but they will be able to do <br>
much more since they can be use all parts of design space, not only <br>
that little corner that was available to evolution.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And is the energy state of diamondoid material higher than that of</i><br>
<i>&gt; organic material?  Probably, in which case this gray goo plague needs</i><br>
<i>&gt; constant input or can only grow by processing lots of material -- which</i><br>
<i>&gt; means that it grows very slowly.</i><br>
<p>
No, in that case the grey plague would not turn everything into <br>
diamonid material but into something in a lower energy state than <br>
organic material (which is in a very high energy state: that's <br>
part of the reason why we eat beef and carrots instead of stones).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; } Well, if the organism is in a free environment, then the plague would </i><br>
<i>&gt; } attack all parts of the skin simultaneously. The whole skin would </i><br>
<i>&gt; } thus have to be shed. The plague would immediately attack again, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wait, diamond nanites are attacking diamond skin?  If there's so much</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy for the plague to live on, obviously your outer defense shouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; be a hard shell, it should be a friendly counter-plague, like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; friendly flora living on our mucous membranes.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but even that would not save you long. You would run out of <br>
resourses. The only way is to go out there and conquer the world <br>
before anyone else does it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; } soon the organism would run out of resources. Alternatively, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; } plague could build explosives and blast your organism. So it seems </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Damn complex plague, building explosives in a coordinated manner.  You</i><br>
<i>&gt; sure it doesn't have internal communiation lines that can be attacked?</i><br>
<p>
But those communication lines are on the outside of your organism. <br>
You would need an immune system that extends all over the place and <br>
that does not allow any significant competition to arise anywhere. <br>
That's what I'm saying. Your castle is not safe.<br>
