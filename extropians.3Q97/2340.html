Yes.  You have described the Connection Machine, models CM-1 and CM-2,<br>
manufactured by the Thinking Machines Corporation of Cambridge Massachusetts<br>
from 1984 to 1990, and designed by yours truly and some other people. Also<br>
the MasPar NCube and the Meiko Computing Surface, and a bunch of others, all<br>
built during the same period.  They sold adequately, but mostly to the<br>
military-industrial complex, so when the cold war ended, so did the sales.<br>
  <br>

Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time, but it turned out that the<br>
right size for a processor is about 32 bits wide, not 1 or 4 bits, and it<br>
turned out that the manufacturing techniques for RAM and processor were<br>
different enough that you're better off putting them on seperate chips.<br>
Then, given that you had designed a 32-bit processor on a chip, you might as<br>
well give up on the central instruction broadcast trick and use a separate<br>
instruction fetch engine on every chip, because it buys lots of flexibility<br>
at little cost.  That's close enough to a regular microprocessor that you're<br>
better off just buying them, and adding special-purpose logic for<br>
interprocessor communication.  The upshot is the design of the CM-5 and<br>
every other post-1990 large parallel computer: hundreds or thousands of<br>
standard one-chip CPUs, each with their own memory, and some special-purpose<br>
network hardware conecting them.<br>
