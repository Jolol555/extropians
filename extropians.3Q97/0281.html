     Roswell and the UFO phenomenon may be the government taking advantage <br>
     of first cold war, now millenial hysteria and keeping a nice <br>
     entertaining dog and pony show going to keep the masses distracted.  <br>
     There is a tinge of paranoia in that statement I suppose but I figure <br>
     when you have access to the mightiest military force on the planet and <br>
     gazillions of dollars, you might just get a little power hungry and <br>
     outta control.<br>
     <br>
     But I'm much more fascinated by the notion that spacecraft (flying <br>
     saucers,etc..) would be impractical for interstellar travel, given the <br>
     inviobility of FTL travel.  Not knowing enough to go on about the <br>
     physics involved, my question is more a request for illumination.  <br>
     What about the notion of interdimensional travel where space is <br>
     "folded" as in Dune or notions (however unfounded) like the wormhold <br>
     in DS9?  Perhaps there are means of sustaining matter as one traverses <br>
     physical dimensions into ones where distance isn't an issue.<br>
     <br>
     Now, I don't really need to know whether or not there are creatures, <br>
     races from other planets.  Chances are pretty high since it's a pretty <br>
     big place that's been around several billions years.  But then again, <br>
     the world was a pretty big place to people who could only travel as <br>
     fast as a horse could gallop (if they had horses) or boats that were <br>
     essentially hollowed-out logs.  The first Spanish ships must've looked <br>
     like some alien mothership to the indigenous natives of the western <br>
     hemisphere.  Distance and vastness are relative to our ability to <br>
     traverse the space.  What took generations, months and thousands of <br>
     lives in the traversing of USAmerica now is done in a matter of hours <br>
     and then we get pissy if the flights are off schedule.  Just 150 years <br>
     or so ago, pissy had a different context.  And now, change is on an <br>
     exponential curve that makes 19th to 20th century innovation pale <br>
     comparison.  We're in for some interesting times.<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
