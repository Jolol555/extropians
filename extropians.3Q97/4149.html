This may be because (pre)people were killed by the usual causes,<br>
stavation, predation, pestilence, before the long range risks had time to <br>
mature.  With little need to fine tune risk assessment of subtle killers<br>
that work over extended time periods, I can see why the 'Big Ones' would cause <br>
more concern: They stand out.  Certainly protecting against even remote risk<br>
provides some advatage while more pertinant and less visible risks go<br>
unnoticed. <br>
