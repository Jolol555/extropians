<i>&gt; In a message dated 97-09-23 05:28:44 EDT, you write:</i><br>

<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; I'm convinced that it is true that if you cannot explain</i><br>
<i>&gt;  your field of study to an interested 10-year old, then you haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt;  understood it yourself. &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll buy that...now for a question?  Suppose that  **I'm** intereted in</i><br>
<i>&gt; something and an  &gt;expert&lt; in the field can't explain it to &gt;me&lt;.  There</i><br>
<i>&gt; seems to be only two possibilities....either I am less capable of</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding than a 10-year old....&lt;so simple that only a child can</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand it????&gt;   or that the &gt;expert&lt; is very much less of an</i><br>
<i>&gt; expert...being unable to explain his subject to a college educated,...fairly</i><br>
<i>&gt; widely read adult something which he SHOULD be able to explain to a child.</i><br>
<p>
Usually it is the expert who is bad at explaining (in school we learn<br>
how to listen to teachers but not how to teach others; I think we would<br>
learn much more if the priorities were reversed). It is frightening <br>
how many experts who cannot explain even the simplest aspects of<br>
their fields; I have found it more enlightening to ask semi-experts<br>
like graduate students than experts like professors in many fields.<br>
<p>
Of course, my initial claim about being able to explain it to an<br>
interested 10-year old has to be taken with a grain of salt. There<br>
are some subjects which require a significant amount of mental<br>
stretching to be able to fully understand (for example, multidimensional<br>
geometry or some mysticism), and they may be beyond the pedagogic<br>
capabilities of most experts. But most subjects can be described<br>
at least in useful detail to an interested listener, given enough<br>
time. <br>
