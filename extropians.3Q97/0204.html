Yes, as long as it's on a voluntary basis (isn't this basically what the<br>
Kleck quote in the other message said?). Trouble is, I work about a<br>
hundred days a year just to pay the taxes the government charges me, then<br>
waste a fair amount of the rest of the time just trying to keep it's<br>
grubby hands off people's guns and encryption software, which doesn't<br>
leave a lot of time to do anything more productive. If the control freaks<br>
were to stop trying to ban everything they see and worsen poverty and<br>
ignorance through (possibly well-intentioned) government programs, then<br>
we've have plenty of time and money to deal with these other issues. <br>
