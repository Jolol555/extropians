I would disagree with your claim that this is a "faith" of extropians.  This<br>
particular extropian has no "faith" in such claims.  My knowledge of<br>
self-replicating systems, of complexity, of ecology, of sociology, of<br>
technological progress has found many facts that convince me that overall, we<br>
are progressing and improving, and that progress in such complicated systems<br>
is very difficult to stop.  <br>
<p>
I recently stated my disagreement with the extropian terminology "dynamic<br>
optimism" partly because it implies that extropian "optimism" results from<br>
irrational faith rather than hard-headed realistic evaluation of fact.<br>
