Hi!<br>
<p>
There are actually two replies on this message (one for Henri Kluytmans<br>
and the other to Prof. Jose Gomes Filho) but since they're small, I<br>
decided to include them in just one message.<br>
<p>
Prof. Jose Gomes Filho wrote:<br>

<i>&gt; Well, for me, an individual includes its behavior and all its interactions</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the environment...</i><br>
<i>&gt; Be the  stick used by a monkey to get some honey from a bee 's colmea or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; particle accelerator, both are consequences of  evolution... and... always</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural... ( Always a self-relashionship of the whole universe  )</i><br>
<i>&gt; Can't admit an evolution dissociated from any of its consequences,</i><br>
<i>&gt; including, of course,  any individual actions, wich work like a feedback to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the continued evolution...</i><br>
<p>
We are all infinite proportions in the universe, we're dust when<br>
compared to the cosmos. It can be said that everything is natural,<br>
everything is part of the cosmos, the molecules that compose our bodies<br>
are the same that compose the universe. Evolution shaped us into what we<br>
are, therefore it has some logic that our achievements and creations are<br>
also a product of evolution.<br>
On the other hand, if someone invented the term artificially to define<br>
some (not all) of our actions and achievements, he/she had something in<br>
his/her mind. I don't know exactly what is the definition of natural and<br>
artificial, I think that artificial is everything that our species had<br>
created/invented. Based on that assumption, wearing glasses is<br>
artificial but also a result of evolution.<br>
<p>
I don't know if this was the reply you were waiting for but it's not a<br>
very clear, easily defined subject.<br>

<i>&gt; I thought your claim was "For extending the human life </i><br>
<i>&gt; it is required to rewrite the DNA." ? </i><br>
<i>&gt; i.e. not just correcting the errors, but designing a completely </i><br>
<i>&gt; new DNA. </i><br>
<p>
No, rewriting the DNA doesn't mean writing a whole new DNA, it means<br>
correcting the existing errors. If one writes a completely new DNA the<br>
consequences can be disastrous.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ok, we have read out all genes, but that doesn't mean that we understand </i><br>
<i>&gt; the program that is written in the genes. I can print out the bits (or </i><br>
<i>&gt; bytes) of a computer program. Everybody can read the ones and zero's,</i><br>
<i>&gt; even</i><br>
<i>&gt; copy them. But do they understand what they are reading, do they</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand </i><br>
<i>&gt; what the program will do? NO!!!</i><br>
<p>
Some aging and senescence related genes have been mapped and some works<br>
(like in Aeiveos, <a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/">http://www.aeiveos.com/</a>) are trying to map the genes<br>
that influence and originate aging.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Actually we're both presenting the same method to reach immortality. </i><br>
<i>&gt; We're both assuming the cell will have to be repaired continuously. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Only you're counting on designing new biological machines </i><br>
<i>&gt; to do the repairing, using the programming language of the DNA.</i><br>
<i>&gt; While I'm counting on designing completely new artificial machines </i><br>
<i>&gt; (which are much more capable and also easier to design!).</i><br>
<p>
Not exactly, my idea is not repair but to prevent damage, by correcting<br>
the errors you prevent the damage in the first place and you won't need<br>
to repair anything (well, .probably old persons already much 'damaged'<br>
by time and age will need to be repaired)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why do I think artificial MNT cell-repair machines are easier to</i><br>
<i>&gt; design? Because you don't have to use DNA gene programming !!</i><br>
<p>
No but you will still have to know what to repair, there are countless<br>
errors in our genome each of them creating it's own effect, there are<br>
several defective proteins and you will have to know what these are in<br>
order to repair them. MNT is highly dependent on microbiology to achieve<br>
the purpose you propose.<br>
As a conclusion, I think MNT might also play a role in achieving life<br>
extension, to repair the damage done to our cells, perhaps even to<br>
change our genes (gene therapy is still not achieving great results<br>
lately) but the ultimate way to achieve life extension is by correcting<br>
our DNA.<br>
