STRANGE MAGAZINE 18 IS OUT THERE<br>
<p>
<p>
OPSASNICK REVIEW UPSETS BIGFOOT BELIEVERS; JOHN GREEN ENTERS SASQUATCH<br>
FIELD AS HOAXER<br>
<p>
<p>
Strange Magazine 18 has been mailed to all subscribers. It should hit<br>
selected bookstores on August 1. There has been a tremendous early<br>
response to issue 18. So far most of the attention has been on Karl<br>
P.N. Shuker's Menagerie of Mystery, Tim Swartz's Oil Pit Squids piece,<br>
the stunning cover by Greg Snook, the thunderbird photo drawings, and<br>
Mark Opsasnick's highly critical review of the book Where Bigfoot Walks<br>
(which includes his honest appraisal of the Pacific Northwest Bigfoot<br>
scene). <br>
<p>
<p>
In his review, Opsasnick referred to Bigfoot author/promoter John Green<br>
as a former newspaperman - Bigfoot hoaxer - turned true-believer. This<br>
statement took some Bigfooters by surprise, since Green is considered<br>
by many Bigfoot fans to be a pillar of Bigfoot belief. While we<br>
appreciate his book Sasquatch: The Apes Among Us for the material that<br>
it includes, we do not hold Green in high esteem. Green, as some of you<br>
know, completely ignored Ray Wallace's role in Bigfoot history,<br>
including the Wallaces' position in the Birth of Bigfoot case in 1958,<br>
despite the fact that Green himself visited Bluff Creek in 1958 and<br>
found tracks there. <br>
<p>
<p>
Despite the fact that some Bigfoot fans would prefer that the truth be<br>
otherwise, it is a documented fact that John Green's entry into the<br>
Sasquatch field was as a result of a hoax.<br>
<p>
<p>
In a telephone conversation that reviewer Mark Opsasnick had with<br>
Green, on May 7, 1988, the Sasquatch maven relayed to Opsasnick how he<br>
got started in the Bigfoot business as a result of a hoax that he<br>
pulled. <br>
<p>
<p>
In 1955 he wrote an account of a hairy manbeast abducting a woman from<br>
a Harrison Hot Springs spa. This phony account was published on the day<br>
of the jokester: April 1. <br>
<p>
<p>
Bigfoot hunter/exploiter Rene Dahinden was one person who thought that<br>
the article was for real. Green recounts the episode in Sasquatch: the<br>
Apes Among Us (Seattle, WA: Hancock House, 1978), p. 49: "At no time<br>
did I have the slightest idea that there was anyone in the community,<br>
or anywhere else, who didn't think the whole business was a joke. In<br>
1956 Rene Dahinden came to my office looking for information that might<br>
assist him in actually finding a Sasquatch...[he] swallowed the whole<br>
thing. His visit made a good story , but I felt rather sorry for him."<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Green's hoax article and its aftermath is also recounted in the<br>
Time-Life book Mysterious Creatures (Alexandria, VA: Time-Life Books,<br>
1988), p. 117.<br>
<p>
<p>
This hoax article inspired the village council at Harrison Hot Springs<br>
to sponsor a phony Sasquatch hunt. Described as a "good-natured spoof,"<br>
this promotional goof for the British Columbia Centennial actually<br>
attracted the interest of the international press.<br>
<p>
<p>
Green's hoax article had unexpected results-- it drew to him a number<br>
of people who had seen Sasquatch or its tracks, and he soon found<br>
himself an avocation. <br>
<p>
<p>

ROWLETT REPORTS ON THE SURRENCY SPOOKLIGHT<br>
<p>
<p>
	The Surrency Spook Light is a classic example of the ghost light<br>
phenomena in the best tradition of the more famous ones, such as the<br>
Marfa Light in Texas and the Brown Mountain Light in North Carolina.<br>
<p>
	The site of the Surrency Light (called the "spook light" by locals) is<br>
centralized along a stretch of the Macon/Brunswick railway that runs<br>
through Surrency, Georgia.<br>
<p>
	This phenomena was first brought to my attention in 1989 by my friend<br>
Mr. James Joyner, who is a resident of nearby Baxley.<br>
<p>
	Mr. Joyner has witnessed the light several times and was kind enough<br>
to allow his account to be retold here.<br>
<p>
	He described how he was standing on the train track at night when the<br>
light appeared several hundred yards in front of him, hovering over the<br>
railway.<br>
<p>
	Mr. Joyner's description of the light was "a very bright,<br>
golden-yellow light, about the size and shape of a grapefruit."<br>
<p>
	When he tried to approach the light, it began to move toward him until<br>
it finally blinked out, only to reappear behind him!<br>
<p>
	He describes his other experience as similar to the first.<br>
<p>
	The Surrency Light has been an observable phenomena since the turn of<br>
the century.<br>
<p>
	Explanations for the light vary from the local belief that it is<br>
somehow connected to the famous Surrency ghost that haunted the<br>
hotel/home of A. P. Surrency (for whom the town is named) to a<br>
mysterious geological formation underneath the ground in Surrency, as<br>
theorized by Cornell University professor Larry Brown.<br>
<p>
	The Surrency hauntings were first written about in the Savannah<br>
Morning News after the paper received a letter from A. P. Surrency.1<br>
<p>
	Hundreds of personal accounts from diaries, as well as books and<br>
magazines, have described tables flying through the air, mirrors<br>
exploding in hallways, clocks running wild after witnesses heard a<br>
mysterious buzzing noise, hot bricks falling from the sky, lights<br>
flickering in the dark, and unexplained voices screaming, crying or<br>
laughing in and around the Surrency house.2<br>
<p>
	The hauntings continued until the house burned down in 1925. <br>
<p>
	Geological professor Larry Brown was part of a team that discovered<br>
what may be an ancient reservoir of water or other fluid nine miles<br>
beneath a pine forest in Surrency.<br>
<p>
	Dr. Brown is a director of the Cornell University-based Consortium for<br>
Continental Reflective Profiling (COCORP) which is developing a<br>
detailed picture of the Earth's mantle.<br>
<p>
	Dr. Brown describes this reservoir as "about two miles in diameter and<br>
apparently shaped like a contact lens."3<br>
<p>
	He also states that "we really don't have a good idea what the<br>
formation is composed of. If it is water, it would upset a lot of<br>
scientific theories as it is theoretically impossible for water or<br>
other fluids to exist at such a great depth due to the intense heat and<br>
pressure."<br>
<p>
	When one considers the amount, the presence of a ghost light, spirit<br>
manifestations and a weird geological formation, it would almost seem<br>
as if there is perhaps what is sometimes referred to as a "window area"<br>
or Lovecraftian doorway at the Surrency site.<br>
<p>
	My own investigation into the Surrency Spook Light is still in its<br>
beginning stage and so will be reported on further as new data comes to<br>
light.<br>

REVIEW<br>
<p>
Reverse Time Travel<br>
<p>
by Barry Chapman<br>
<p>
Cassell, London, 1996, 160 pp., paperback, $16.95.<br>
<p>
Reviewed by Douglas Chapman<br>
<p>
With simplicity and clarity, Barry Chapman supports his case that time<br>
travel is possible. Starting with "a brief history of everything,"<br>
layer by layer, equation by equation, Chapman uses Einstein's theory of<br>
General Relativity to show that there may be a way to travel back in<br>
time. Such topics as the principle of equivalence, gravitational<br>
curvature, black holes, and the twin paradox are brought into play.<br>
<p>
While the present reviewer is not qualified to judge the efficacy of<br>
the scientific theories involved, Chapman clearly explains his<br>
premises.<br>
<p>
He asks many of the proper questions. One is that: if time travel<br>
exists, why have humans not knowingly met any travellers from the<br>
future? In response to this, in his "five-dimensional hyperspherical<br>
model" Chapman postulates that the time travellers may have ended up in<br>
different universes from the one in which they started. But then, why<br>
have travellers from elsewhere not shown up in the present universe?<br>
Whatever its limits, his idea does explain why people cannot kill their<br>
parents and then vanish out of existence themselves.<br>
<p>
For Chapman, not only is the universe curved, but so are the fifth<br>
dimension and the universes encompassed. <br>
<p>
The universe's customary "curve balls" may abound, but the author tries<br>
for clarity anyway. Useful appendices with supporting equations and a<br>
subject- oriented bibliography make the book as easy to use as<br>
possible. Whether one agrees or not, it is apt to broaden it readers'<br>
horizons.  <br>
