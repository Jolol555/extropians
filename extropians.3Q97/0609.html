Because of current available information, programs and news (such as the one<br>
I mentioned) which focus on sex change and the deep psychological problems<br>
of the individuals who underwent it only to find out later in life, I think<br>
that more attention will be paid to who makes the choice.  Unfortunately our<br>
parents are making that choice in our early lives (they sign the papers) in<br>
tandy with the medical profession. Parents who are not well informed will be<br>
looking towards doctors for advice.<br>

The  medical profession in a broad sense.  It must include psychologists,<br>
especially those well educated in gender changes and social issues. <br>

<p>
According to the doctrine of the medical profession they should not.<br>
<p>
I wonder if a child's sex might be left alone until he/she decides which way<br>
to go, or both ways, or no way.  We will see a mosaic of sex-types in the<br>
coming years.  This will only become a bigger issue.<br>
