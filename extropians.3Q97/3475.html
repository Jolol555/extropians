	Why would you say this?  Before we had the "Fed" controlling<br>
things and things were based on "hard" money or Gold there were<br>
periods of wild inflation when there was plenty of God and periods of<br>
wild deflation when Gold became scarce.  Such wild fluctuations often<br>
totally devastated the economy and was very unfair to some and gave<br>
way to much to others arbitrarily based on the Gold supply.<br>
<p>
	For the last 15 or so years things have been unbelievably<br>
stable with a very consistent small rate of inflation, which is the<br>
ideal.  Thanks, largely to the Fed leaders, Volker and Greenspan<br>
during this time.  Of course there have been times when the Fed<br>
screwed up, but even these times were fare better than when money was<br>
"hard" and no one controlled it.<br>
<p>
	Sure money is an invention.  It's a token that represents an<br>
amount of work or capital.  It's value is roughly the total ammount of<br>
work we can all do or our capital divided by the total amount of<br>
dollars available.  To be fair to all, especially from one generation<br>
to the next, this value should remain fairly constant or slightly<br>
inflationary.  This requires some kind of control over how many<br>
dollars there are, especially since the total amount of work that can<br>
be done and the ammount of work we all want to be done in any given<br>
year is so dynamic and growing.<br>
