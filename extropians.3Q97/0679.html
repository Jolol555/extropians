&lt;I hope this information [Terrence McKenna’s _Food of the Gods_<br>
theory] prompts two conversations: the role of psychedelics in<br>
advancing consciousness (because I feel it has advanced mine) and the<br>
seemingly exponential increase in novelty in modern times.&gt;<br>
<p>
Not that I don’t think psychedelics have been useful tools in the<br>
development of human consciousness, but there are some other<br>
scientific theories that help explain humanity’s preference and<br>
ability for innovation and creativity.  The "exponential increase in<br>
novelty in modern times", though driven by our evolved capacity for<br>
curiosity, seems surely due to an outward-looking focus on science,<br>
commerce, gadgetry and rising awareness of cultural diversity through<br>
much-enhanced communication channels rather than any inward-looking,<br>
spiritual focus or drive to ‘return to nature’ as ‘noble savages’.<br>
<p>
One theory about how our capacity for curiosity and creativity evolved<br>
was described recently in a 970712 Science News article by Bruce<br>
Bower: "Humanity’s Imprecision Vision: A Volatile World May have<br>
Forged Minds That make a Virtue of Uncertainty", describing the work<br>
of Smithsonian anthropologist Richard Potts who "exalts uncertainty as<br>
the way of the world and the instigator of human nature" in his 1996<br>
book _Humanity’s Descent_ and the 960816 issue of Science magazine.<br>
<p>
Pott’s theory of "variability selection" claims that "animal species<br>
best able to scrounge a living from whatever resources were available<br>
gained the upper hand over pickier creatures" that were more optimized<br>
for specific niches.  Most of Pott’s claims are based on sedimentary<br>
and fossil records of climate change which supposedly show that<br>
"hominids had to react nimbly each [of the many] time[s] the<br>
environmental rug was pulled out from under their feet".<br>
