A nice idea, but unfortunately the lead is the problem: where do you<br>
get enough lead to encase the fusion bomb? <br>

I like this two-stage approach, maybe we should look at stars which<br>
first brighten a bit, and then go nova...<br>
<p>
OK, I have to admit that this scheme is a bit too conservative (in<br>
the Drexler sense :-) for me, I dislike blowing things up since so<br>
much can go wrong. So when I notice that you are starting to buy lead<br>
and neon extraction equipment, several copies of me will be heading<br>
for the stars as fast as their ships can go :-)<br>
