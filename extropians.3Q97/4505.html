<i>&gt; Hi Shaun !</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  I have always disliked the whole idea of "left" and "right" in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;politics (or non-politics, as it may be.)  By saying that one is "left</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;wing" it gives the impression that the person in question has *only* left</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;wing tendencies when they may possess many "right wing" qualities as well.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, left-right is very reductionnist way of thinking. I personnaly</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't share most of the philosophical or artistical values of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; "left-winged" friends. I always found Sartre, Foucault or Derrida boring to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the utmost! But people think with packages. for instance, most</i><br>
<i>&gt; "free-market" people hate abortion, women's lib, drug use, and  are</i><br>
<i>&gt; (frequently) christian fundamentalists and creationists. Our first attempt</i><br>
<i>&gt; must be to go behind these "packages". I think the core "socialist values"</i><br>
<i>&gt; can be freed from their depressive thinking, as the core "capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; values" can be freed from social and political conservatisms. In this post</i><br>
<i>&gt; , for the clarity of discussion,( and avoiding flames!)  I'll continue to</i><br>
<i>&gt; use the terms "left" and "right" to design the "core" values.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, free-market people tend to be rather hands off with many of the<br>
issues you claim they they espouse. Pat Buchanan vs. Bob Dole &amp; Jesse<br>
Helms vs. Bill Weld shows that there is a rather serious rift among so<br>
called right wingers between free-marketers and social fundamentalists.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;If one says that they think that government should be abolished, obviously</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;they are anarchists; if their reason is because the government has done</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;virtually nothing to feed the starving and homeless, then their position</i><br>
<i>&gt; is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;pretty obvious.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd prefer to ask: since the governement exists, and we cannot destroy it</i><br>
<i>&gt; next sunday after lunch, how to use it ? I prefer to see it feed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; homeless rather than using my money for army or making gifts to big</i><br>
<i>&gt; corporations....</i><br>
<p>
I'd much rather invest my money in a corporation that will give me back<br>
my money with a handsome return while growing the economy than having it<br>
confiscated by politicians who think they know so much better than I how<br>
to spend my money on people who havent got the guts to get off their<br>
asses and get to work. If I invest my money in a corporation, that<br>
corporation will be able to expand production, increasing employment, so<br>
mobody has to starve or be homeless.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Hitler was an outstanding example of a "left wing extremist" even</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;progress.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Uh, really ? don't you do the same cult-like dichotomy by saying Hitler was</i><br>
<i>&gt; a left-wing extremist ? I lurk this list since several weeks, and I thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; that since a clever post by Hagbard/Keith, nobody here would dare to put</i><br>

National SOcialism was the marriage of mercantile socialsm with the<br>
nationalism movement that originated from a  little science fiction book<br>
published in the 1880's by an American by the name of Bellamy. The book<br>
was "Looking Backward". If you think 1984 or Brave New World was<br>
precient, read this book.<br>

<i>&gt; Damien Sullivan wrote :</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This, of course, begs the question.  The anarcho-(socialist,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;syndicalist, communist) claim is that property, such as owning a car</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;which isn't used 90% of the time, or land you've never even visited when</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;there are landless peasants starving in megacity slums, is theft and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;coercion.  So they would say "the 'right' wouldn't survive without</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;utilizing coercion (oxymoron!), or adapting socialist techniques."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Exactly. Every act of privatization begins by an enclosure act ("this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; mine: I will kill anybody who enter here") which is an act of cercion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The main difference between (sorry for the crude terms) left anarchy and</i><br>
<i>&gt; right anarchy is that the second see "The state" and "the Market" as</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposing entities, and that the first sees the State as simple</i><br>
<i>&gt; superstructure used by the wealthies to protect their rights against the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "have-not". They are therefore allies, more: state is just the</i><br>
<i>&gt; institutional representation of the property system.</i><br>
<i>&gt; An other difference is more semantic. I suspect right-anarchist to use the</i><br>
<i>&gt; term "market" as a model of any kind of free interaction, as the left</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarchists see in "market" only one kind of interaction. "Free markets",</i><br>
<i>&gt; according to this definition,  is therefore,  to use Bateson's terms, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "maximisation of one variable", which can be disastrous to the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt; system, built on many variables.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry. Private property comes about in two ways: citizens purchase title<br>
to or grant of property (if we are merely talking about real estate)<br>
from a sovreign power, or "discovers"  abandoned or unimproved unclaimed<br>
land and claims sovreign right to that land. The loophole that leftists<br>
use to brush all examples with are incidences where "civilized" peoples<br>
encounter indigenous primitive peoples, and simply kill off the<br>
primitives. This does not apply to situations where indigenous peoples<br>
engage in treaties with other peoples but do not have the capacity or<br>
the will to enforce the terms of the treaties. Note the word "enforce".<br>
That all real estate property rights typically derive from those granted<br>
by the sovereign government justifies government imposing property taxes<br>
on owners of real estate.<br>
<p>
The second way that private property comes about is through work. This<br>
is the area that market anarchists typically are completely correct in<br>
stating that government is comitting theft to expropriate any portion of<br>
the added value that an individual produces in the economy through their<br>
work, or through the investment of the value of surplus work value.<br>
<p>
What is so hypocritical and unethical about leftist statism is their<br>
argument that since they are in charge of the government, and they are<br>
the representatives of the people, that they rightfully are responsible<br>
for all property, disposition of labor and distribution of the fruits of<br>
labor.<br>
<p>
The only difference between left statists (communists or socialists) and<br>
right statists (mercantilists) is that right statists are unabashed in<br>
acknowldging that they are in control, while leftists con the people<br>
into thinking that they are in control because the leftist merely<br>
"represents the people". It was this kind of logic that Lenin used to<br>
end multiparty elections in Russia.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We all use everyday an anarcho-socialist system which works quite well: the</i><br>
<i>&gt; internet. Here, most of the informations are given for free, and everybody</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand that for the system to work, they must give information as much</i><br>
<i>&gt; as they take. When you go to a site where there is some valuable</i><br>
<i>&gt; information that you must pay (I grant you an exclusive license, blah,</i><br>
<i>&gt; blah, etc), do you immediately give your Visa Card number, or do you go</i><br>
<i>&gt; back to Alta vista or Excite to see if somebody doesn't offer you the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; information for free?</i><br>
<p>
Really, who "gave" you your internet address? It costs money to get such<br>
an address, as well as to maintain it. Your claims of "all info being<br>
free" is also disingenuous, as most sites that provide free information<br>
typically only give out a small portion of such information. The rest<br>
must be accessed via the purchase of a subscription. Those sites that<br>
are free to access are paid for via advertising, or are funded by<br>
government or non-profit institutions (and most government sites also<br>
charge for much information).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anarcho-socialism works pretty well like the iterated prisonner's dilemna.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I will share my goods if i know that, on the long run, I will beneficiate</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the others goods.Of course the benefit must be higher than the "price"</i><br>
<i>&gt; of my contribution, otherwise the system would not work (And this implies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; IMO, a high technological level, such as the Culture's).   In the realm of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Internet we see that most  companies such as Microsoft or Sun  found</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessary to give for free a big amount of their products simply to be able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to sell some.(See internet Explorer or the JDK). To save the capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; system, they are therefore compelled to cope with a "socialist" way of</i><br>
<i>&gt; exchange.  Here we see that things are never completely opposites, like in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a chess game. We are here in a very complex game of Go.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, capitalists invented the "loss leader" centuries before socialism<br>
was a twinkle in a madman's eye. My freind Tomima Edmark, the inventor<br>
of the topsy tail (that annoying plastic dohickey for making cool<br>
ponytails that is sold on TV) makes more money than ever by giving away<br>
all sorts of other junk along with the purchase to give the buyer more<br>
"value".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;"Left" anarchy is nothing more than intellectual masturbation for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;socialist and communist ideological refugees, particulary in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Ideological refugees?  Anarcho-communism is at least as old as Marxism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course. Bakounin participated with Marx at the 1st Internationale, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; he was the fist to predict that Marxist ideas would be dangerous to</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom. Since, communists killed enough anarchists (especially during the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Spain war, where they  were officially allies) to demonstrate their</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideological differences..</i><br>
