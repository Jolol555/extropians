Citizens Supporting Science Ratings of Congress' Technology Voting Record<br>
<p>
	Has your Representative or Senator been a good girl or boy as far<br>
as science appropriations go? Have they been stifling biomedical research<br>
by voting against fetal tissue experimentation again? Have they been<br>
trying to shut down the Mir Station (again)? Now, you can find out,<br>
because the CSS Congressional Ratings have arrived (with generous help<br>
from Voter Information Services Inc.).<br>
	If you vote in the US, take a look at<br>
<a href="http://www.umich.edu/~alexboko/css/bydist.html">http://www.umich.edu/~alexboko/css/bydist.html</a><br>
(it loads much faster than the previous, home-grown ratings page)  Let me<br>
know if you find any factual or grammatical errors. An annotated list of<br>
the Congressional votes researched to obtain these ratings will be<br>
available by the end of this week. <br>
<p>
	Now, I know that many of us here don't care much for the Federal<br>
Government, and with good reason. However, ignoring it is not the best<br>
option. It exists (for the time being), and its mistakes affect our<br>
future. If we're smart we're going to use the Fed (along with every other<br>
tool at our disposal) to insure that the technological utopias we keep<br>
talking about actually happen within our lifetimes.<br>

                                            --Sincerely, Alex F. Bokov<br>
