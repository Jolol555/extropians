The discussion about how to raise kids leads to the more general<br>
societal question of how values and authority should override<br>
individuals whose judgement in certain situations may be impaired. <br>
<p>
Children are generally assumed to lack good judgement, especially when<br>
very young. But we all are like children in situations where we cannot<br>
know some or all of the important outcomes of our actions, or where we<br>
are aware of the outcomes but we attribute very different values to<br>
those outcomes than do others who care about the outcomes and/or us, or<br>
where we differ in the assessement of probabilities of various outcomes,<br>
or all three.<br>
<p>
Who/what is going to act as the parent in such situations? Who gets to<br>
decide who is the child and who is the parent? Do "parents" have rights<br>
to impose their wills on "children?" I will take a Devil's Advocate<br>
position and say that (even in a post-human society) one of society's<br>
most important functions is to be the "meta-parent," deciding the<br>
policies that provide good answers to the above questions. As a<br>
meta-parent society must strike numerous balances among competing values<br>
and ignorance of outcomes. Else the resulting chaos and anarchy will<br>
reduce the society's potential to achieve win-win outcomes, and to avoid<br>
self-destruction (assuming self-destruction is something to be<br>
avoided!).<br>
<p>
Does this make me pro-government? No and Yes. Governments as we know<br>
them today by and large abdicate their responsibilities to be good<br>
meta-parents. But some form of self-regulating authority and enforcement<br>
is clearly needed, just as real parents are.<br>
