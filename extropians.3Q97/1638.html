I may be showing some of Grof's slides in early September, those<br>
interested please email me. I was also one of the early, legal!<br>
volunteers who tried MDMA....<br>

<i>&gt; This is really the area of drugs that connects with Extropianism most, I</i><br>

True, and wAAAAAy deeper than the cognitive approches favored by some<br>
Extropians.... (any of you wanting to discuss this privately, well,<br>
email me or see ya at Extro-3.)<br>
