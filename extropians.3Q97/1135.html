It makes sense that the first firms to take this approach are themselves<br>
consulting companies.  They have the pressures of variable business and<br>
cost issues, and they already need to track costs pretty closely.  Making<br>
this work for a product company seems harder to me, but I'm not sure why.  <br>
<p>
Possible reasons: <br>
 -- long-term product development needs people to see the firm's best<br>
interests as their own<br>
<p>
 -- products require more coordination than contracted projects or<br>
services, despite what coders think. <br>
<p>
 -- products aren't as well thought-out initially than tasks a company<br>
plans to out-source<br>
<p>
 -- the difficulty of signaling that the same task is more critical or more<br>
profitable on one product than another<br>
<p>
 -- the difficulty designing products to interface with other company<br>
product and to scale appropriately (i.e. company needs that are separate<br>
from market needs)<br>
<p>
 -- if a product has direct impact on a company's revenue, then upper<br>
management needs to meddle or it would never get out the door ;-)<br>
<p>
Am I off-base here?  It could be that this is happening left and right,<br>
it's just happening slowly.<br>
<p>
Here's the one example I have.  Chris Cole, the person I mentioned in my<br>
earlier post, has what he calls the "Product Author Model".  Senior coders<br>
in his company pitched ideas, and when they are given a green light they<br>
were responsible for design and implementation of that entire product.<br>
They were funded for their salary and other costs of developing the<br>
product, including salaries for other coders (though Chris believed in<br>
small coding teams, much like Brooks in _The Mythical Man-Month_).  Product<br>
Authors also got a cut of the profit from that product, usually around 6%.<br>
If people are interested, I can come up with some more details about this<br>
model.<br>
