You are correct in principle, but your solution would be rather<br>
expensive<br>
both in initial cost and in storage space. Still, it may be time to<br>
look at this approach again.<br>
<p>
This is essentially a good idea. It violates no known laws of physics<br>
:-)<br>
<p>
Lets see: the english language has a bunch of words, but the typical<br>
working vocabulary for this sort of thing might be about 15,000, roots,<br>
with (say) an average of 4 words per root. (I'm guessing, but check a<br>
dictionary.) So, we need to pay a reader to read 60,000 words, four<br>
times<br>
each. With associated overhead like clicking a button when the word is<br>
flashed on the screen, the paid reader might do a word every 4 seconds<br>
for (say) 4 hours per paid workday. That's 3600 words per day. Call it<br>
20 workdays, and you can probably get it done by cheap labor (i.e., a <br>
high school kid.)  OK, the up-front cost isn't as high as we thought!<br>
<p>
Now, what about the storage cost? I'd guess that a word will take, on<br>
average, half a second to speak. A modern particular realtime<br>
continuous speech compression algorithm known as A-CELP can compress<br>
high-quality speech into 4000 bits/sec, or 500 bytes/sec. I strongly<br>
suspect that you can derive an off-line compression algorithm that can<br>
cut this in half, to 250 bytes/sec, or 125 bytes/word. So, our database<br>
isn't too big after all: 7.5Mb. On a modern computer, that's nothing.<br>
<p>
The computer would still have to handle the words other than these<br>
60,000<br>
based on a phonetic dictionary, and any word not in the reader's list<br>
or in the phonetic dictionary would still have to use the rules<br>
dictionary,<br>
just as the current crop of programs do. However, we can use a much<br>
bigger<br>
phonetic dictionalry than today's programs, because we can most likely<br>
write a program that can parse the phonetic spellings from the Random<br>
House Unabridged CD-ROM or any other CD-ROM dictionary (after paying the<br>
royalty, of course!)<br>
<p>
Yes, grammatical analysis would be needed for stressing, and yes, it<br>
would<br>
be a big problem. My guess is that the program would get it wrong about<br>
half the time. Its amazing how often a radio announcer messes up an<br>
advertizement when a word is used in an unusual way.<br>
For instance the emphasis should be different on the second word of<br>
<p>
"We have an occasional problem" and "We have an occasional table"<br>
