Like maybe the fact that choosing to live under another state, seriously<br>
alters your life, whereas choosing to use other companies<br>
products/services, doesn't.<br>
<p>
I can't say i'm happy knowing that large amounts of resources are owned by<br>
entities, that do not have the interest of humans as their priority.<br>
(companies maybe even less than states), but i can live with the fact that<br>
people at least have a weapon to influence companies (=boycot). Whereas<br>
states just lock you up if you refuse to pay for their services, and in<br>
return you get to vote on who decides how much more of your money they're<br>
going to take away this 4 year period, and how many more of those services<br>
they're going to scrap with that extra money. <br>
<p>
I see a dark future where everything you buy is either damaging to your<br>
health or to the environment, and has a special tax on it. Not according to<br>
how damaging it is, but to price/consumer curves of how much they can add<br>
to the product, to recieve their maximum income from it.<br>
<p>
('what ?, tax on fuel has gone down ? has it overnight become slightly less<br>
dangerous to the environment ? or was it damaging the tax income received<br>
from our national transport industry ?, damn...') <br>
