In a social animal, like humans, these two behaviors have markedly different<br>
Darwinian fitness.  Other humans will cooperate with someone who lets other<br>
people starve; but they will avoid, imprison, or even kill the murder.<br>
 There's also the issue that it's far riskier to kill another applicant in<br>
the office bathroom than to allow a North Korean to starve.<br>

<p>
With humans, probably very *sub*optimal.  A critical part of optimizing human<br>
production is improving their systems of social interaction and<br>
communication.  We do not differ markedly from 35,000-year-ago human<br>
physically or in innate IQ but our society is vastly more productive, from<br>
being set up differently.  The society you describe would greatly curtail the<br>
possibilities for friendly, cooperative interaction between humans and hence<br>
likely be far less productive than the current one.<br>
