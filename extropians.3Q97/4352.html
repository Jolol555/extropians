<p>
Here's an interesting take on it:<br>
<p>
As an 18-year-old, I was part of the first generation to grow up with<br>
computers.  I was introduced to a Mac Plus at the age of seven (I think).  I<br>
grew up in two realities.  "Click to select" is right up there with "move legs<br>
to walk".<br>
<p>
Your generation has no trouble adapting to virtual reality and the Web and the<br>
Internet.  (Although some grandparents, the non-early-adopter ones, are<br>
completely left out.)  But you might find the Singularity frightening, as<br>
Vinge does.  I actually find the concept warm and cozy, simple and obvious,<br>
the more I think about it.  At first I was a fanatic advocate; now I just take<br>
it for granted.  The Singularity just makes more sense than leading an<br>
ordinary life.<br>
<p>
Maybe there's just a maturation window involved.  Anybody can learn to use<br>
computers as tools, but can you really regard the Other Reality, with entirely<br>
different Laws of physics, as being equal to the Real Life you grew up in? <br>
You can use computers, but can you freely and without prejudice regard them as<br>
human?  Not that my Plus was human, but there may be a hardwired maturation<br>
window for who we regard as being "people".  Since I had a computer early on,<br>
then even though it wasn't human, I'm hardwired to regard computers as people<br>
- not aliens.  Just as a baby will regard all autonomously moving objects (a<br>
wind-up car) as animals.  No logic, just the different emotional reactions.<br>
<p>
And I don't find it frightening at all to contemplate stepping entirely into<br>
Other Reality.  I grew up there, after all - it's as much home to me as<br>
anywhere else.  Occasionally I even export the Laws of Other Reality into Real<br>
Life, as when I dragged my finger over a paragraph of printed text in order to<br>
select it.  Or when I tapped on a printed, underlined Web address in order to<br>
visit it.<br>
<p>
Before I arrived on the scene, the standard Singularity calculation was that<br>
"We'll have human-equivalent intelligence in 20XX", and this was the<br>
Singularity.  Then I continued the calculation to find that 3 years after<br>
human-equivalent AIs, AIs reach infinite speed, and I called *that* the<br>
Singularity.  The reason being that while I found AI to be exciting, it wasn't<br>
shocking.  It didn't strike me as a *conclusion*.  The old Singularity<br>
calculation was incomplete; it didn't really say anything to me that I didn't<br>
already know.<br>
<p>
You call me a Rapturist.  "Humanity becomes something unimaginably different<br>
and unknowable" is the definition of Singularity::Transcension, I believe. <br>
But I grew up, partially, in Other Reality, where all Laws are transient as<br>
clouds, blown about on the winds of technology.  All except one:  Moore's Law.<br>
 Things always get faster, more powerful, more complex.  Always.  Where Other<br>
Reality and Real Life clash, Real Life usually wins, because the Laws of Real<br>
Life are more constant, mountains to the Other Reality's clouds.  But Moore's<br>
Law, the great constant, has already begun to seep into Real Life.  Why<br>
shouldn't it go all the way?<br>
<p>
The Singularity may be counterintuitive to you, but you grew up in Real Life,<br>
where the Laws are constant and things change over decades.  To me,<br>
Transcension is homey and familiar, the logical conclusion of one of the<br>
realities I grew up in.<br>
<p>
Once the Singularity excited and shocked me.  No longer.  I'm used to it.<br>
