Who says this is constant?  Virtual particles are popping in and out of<br>
existence all the time.  A lot of my workarounds to the Laws of Physics rely<br>
on creating equal amounts of negative and positive mass/energy - since even<br>
negative mass represents a positive amount of information.  (I don't think<br>
there's any way to represent a negative amount of information, which is too<br>
bad, because otherwise there'd be a REALLY INTERESTING form of matter out<br>
there somewhere!  Anti-real matter!)<br>
<p>
Anyway, I don't know if there's a genuine upper bound on the amount of<br>
information the Universe can store.  Unless the Universe is quantized, the<br>
amount is equal to - at least - aleph-2.  (All those fields of real<br>
numbers...)  Even supposing the Bekenstein Bound - what about all the digits<br>
of pi?  Even excluding "Platonic" information, what about virtual particles<br>
and negative matter?  Would there still be some physical bound on the number<br>
of positive and negative "particles"?  I sure don't know.<br>
<p>
And - out of curiosity - there can't possible be a sharp distinction between<br>
"Preal" things and "Punreal" things.  Even if there is a sharp physical<br>
bound... wouldn't it be essentially arbitrary in some way?  I cannot see any<br>
reason why there would be a limit on how much information can be "real".  At<br>
worst, we might be ontologically restricted to some low number or ordinal of<br>
aleph-infinity.  So if Preal and Punreal don't describe any testable or<br>
fundamental quality of a string... what's the point?<br>
