Hmm, exactly what evidence do you refer to here? You wording is<br>
rather fuzzy. <br>
<p>

<p>
That ought to be noticeable in the sheep that are brought up this way<br>
(it is very unlikely basal stuff like this would be restricted only<br>
to humans; mammals in general have some clever ways of ensuring the<br>
mother-child bond and emotional development). If it really is<br>
important with a more natural artificial womb the lambs ought to show<br>
averse emotional reactions when brought up. <br>
<p>
My personal main worry about the procedure (as shown in the brief<br>
film clip I saw) was that the womb was transparent and in a lighted<br>
room. I'm not certain, but this *could* affect the development of<br>
vision (both positively and negatively). <br>
<p>
We'll see when the data is published. <br>
