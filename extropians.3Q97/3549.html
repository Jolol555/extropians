Forgive me if these questions have been debated previously.  'Uploading'<br>
has just caught my fancy.  It seems a near-viable take-off on the same<br>
subject as described in Greg Bear's "Eon" book (or vice versa).  I've<br>
searched through a dozen or so pages on the subject at the Extropy web<br>
site and haven't found the answers.  Asking here just to save time even<br>
if flamed...<br>
<p>
1)  Would an individual be uploaded to a centralized 'net' or a private<br>
one?  Would there be a benefit in either?  If centralized how would<br>
'you' affect 'me'?<br>
<p>
2)  Have security and backups been researched?  Could someone 'pull the<br>
plug' and delete everyone?  Could a virus be introduced to<br>
control/corrupt/erase an uploaded individual?<br>
<p>
3)  Since 'thought' (as far as I can remember) is somewhat determined by<br>
protein deposits at specific neurons (changing the course to the next<br>
neuron I suppose) wouldn't everyone in a central 'net' then think alike?<br>
<p>
4)  Do emotion and the senses determine how one thinks?  I know my mood<br>
affects my thought processes and certain smells or sounds do also.  How<br>
will this be handled in a 'net'?<br>
<p>
5)  If there would be no emotion I wouldn't 'care' if I were thinking or<br>
not.  Would I cease to exist?  <br>
