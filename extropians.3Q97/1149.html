<p>
Although not yet published in a scientific journal, The new York Times has <br>
gotten wind of what Dr. Ian Wilmut and his company, PPL, are up to. They've <br>
cloned another sheep, but this time they've inserted a human gene into it <br>
that is operational in every cell of its body, including the germ cells, <br>
that means the gene would be passed on into the next generation. Previously <br>
the only way to do this was very slow and expensive because you had to use <br>
hard to find fertilized egg cell and the success rate was very low, Wilmut <br>
can now use any cell and mammals have many trillions to spare. In addition, <br>
the old method could only add genes it could not remove them, with Wilmut's <br>
new method genes can be added or removed at will, this could be very <br>
important, and fast. Pig organs aren't very good for transplants because<br>
each pig cell has a sugar on its surface that the human immune system doesn't <br>
like, if the gene for this sugar was removed things could get interesting.<br>
                                    <br>
Dr. Lee Silver of Princeton University says of this:<br>
<p>
 "After Dolly [the first cloned sheep, also made by Wilmut] everyone would   <br>
  have predicted this, but they were saying it would happen in 5 or 10 years.   <br>
  We are getting closer and closer to human beings too. All of this can be   <br>
  passed over to human beings. Genetic engineering of human beings is now <br>
  really on the horizon."<br>
<p>
Dr. Keith Campbell of the PPL team says:<br>
<p>
 "Two years ago people would have thought what we have achieved to date was  <br>
  impossible. I certainly did."<br>
                <br>
Although they certainly deserve it, I'll bet that Wilmut and Campbell will <br>
not receive the Nobel Prize for this, at least not for many years, it's too <br>
controversial. I hope I'm wrong.                  <br>
