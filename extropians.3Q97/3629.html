<i>&gt; &gt;With humans, probably very *sub*optimal. A critical part of optimizing</i><br>

I believe the process of deliberate selection, itself, would be highly<br>
inimical to a healthy society, regardless of what is selected for.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Precisely. We have not changed, maybe we're missing out on a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;growth-potential. We have not tried strong selection on traits like IQ.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Not that I think we should, but it's an interesting thought-experiment.</i><br>
<p>
Well, yes, and my conclusion is that strong selection would be catastrophic.<br>
 Selecting for a relatively narrow feature like IQ would likely be doubly<br>
catastrophic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;The society you describe would greatly curtail the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;possibilities for friendly, cooperative interaction between humans and</i><br>
hence<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why?, it's not like our current society has no blood on it's hands. We</i><br>
<i>&gt;allow preventable deaths and sleep very well in spite of it. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Of course the deaths would be closer to home for us</i><br>
<i>&gt;rich-folks-in-rich-country's</i><br>
<i>&gt;and that might be a bit nasty (the little boy next-door failing his IQ-test</i><br>
<i>&gt;and such...). But I don't see why 'friendly, cooperative interaction'</i><br>
<i>&gt;between the surviving individuals would be far less.</i><br>
<p>
There's little *deliberate* selection.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Both nazi-germany and stalinist-russi performed great engineering and</i><br>
<i>&gt;scientific feats in spite of their totalitarian nature.</i><br>
<p>
I think "in spite of" is the correct term.  <br>
