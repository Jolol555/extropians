        I doubt that I am the only list member who winced when s\he read<br>
this...a very good example of an infectuous meme.  This, of course, was<br>
derived from the first post in the "Huh?" thread --an idea sprouted by Mr.<br>
Ian Cruikshank.<br>
<p>
        For anyone who has just recently joined this list, I must (as Eric<br>
Watt Forste touched on) mention that the ideas upon extropianism rambled by<br>
Ian Cruikshank are very convoluted.  It seems that the man in question has<br>
either not looked into extropianism to any extent, or has such a narrow and<br>
hypocritical mind that he cannot see beyond the views which he himself has<br>
adopted.  A statement like "...extropians view capitalism as the only<br>
accepted form of spontaneous order..." is not only untrue, but it is almost<br>
an exact antithesis to the open-mindedness of a desirable extropian future<br>
progress.  Whatever works for spontaneous order is certainly accepted.<br>
<p>
        Cruikshank has made an assortment of unsupported claims about<br>
extropy...claims which are, for the most part, untrue.  In addition, to<br>
leave the list on the basis of one person's personal opinions is not such<br>
an open-minded move.  Extropy is not at all like a religion or a "cult" as<br>
Cruikshank claims --every extropian has different views on different things<br>
and nothing, save for the desire for progress and freedom, is set.<br>
