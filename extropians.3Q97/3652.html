     And I...EvMick...the trucker...am the ultimate "street person" ...I <br>
     live on the streets.. and Interstates...and back roads...but ...unlike <br>
     the beggars you  elevate though...I work for a living...and resent you <br>
     using that term...<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight:<br>
     <br>
     At the risk of igniting a personal melodrama, I must inquire as to <br>
     what you actually resent: "brother" or "homeless" or "street person" <br>
     and why you feel cause to hold resentment when the subject didn't <br>
     reference that of truckers who "work", "contribute" or otherwise <br>
     provide an agreed upon "service" to the community at large.<br>
     <br>
     If you have a satellite link with a laptop with you on the road, I <br>
     presume you have sleeping quarters in your rig unless you jack in <br>
     through your hotel room phone.  I presume you have money (which you <br>
     earn for the service you provide) to stop at a truck stop (or anywhere <br>
     else) and feed yourself.  I presume you presume upon no one for any <br>
     handouts.  I presume you are not cold, wet, disoriented by mental <br>
     illness or drugs you've injected into your veins or snorted up your <br>
     nose.  Given those presumptions, I would agree that you are the <br>
     *ultimate* street person &lt;G&gt;.<br>
     <br>
     Therefore, respectfully, I ask what point are you trying to make in <br>
     stating resentment?<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
