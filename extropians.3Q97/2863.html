If we assume that we need to cover at least 99.99% of the earth with <br>
some immune system  (which I do), then we can as well cover all of <br>
it, I suppose. So let's reformulate:<br>
<p>
2. In a multipolar world, the whole earth must be protected by one <br>
immune system or another. If only cities were protected, attack goo <br>
could easily extinguish all intelligent life.<br>
<p>

<p>
But that would be an enormously expensive battle and it should be <br>
avoided.<br>

<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Certain minimum technology level" is completely vague.  You can shift</i><br>
<i>&gt; the levels on either side to force whatever result you want.  And I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think I disagree with the claim in general anyway: the natures of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "island" and "sea" do matter.  A spore surrounded by white blood cells</i><br>
<i>&gt; and a city surrounded by whatnot are not the same thing.  A city can</i><br>
<i>&gt; defeat a first wave and then cannibalize the remains, becoming stronger.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The spread of civilization, except here the wild comes to the city</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than vice versa.</i><br>
<p>
I inserted the "minimum technology" proviso into Eliezer's original <br>
formulation to make sure that the sea could avoid making itself <br>
available as dinner. But is there such a minimum technology that <br>
would do the trick no matter how advanced the island? I suppose there <br>
is (design space limited),though it might be very high up on the <br>
technology ladder. Sooner or later, the sea would reach that level of <br>
technology, and then it would defeat the island, unless the island <br>
had made itself into a sea by that time. So we reformulate:<br>
<p>
	In the long run, an island cannot defend itself against a sea.<br>
