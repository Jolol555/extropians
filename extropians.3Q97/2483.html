Sorry guys...I can't pass this up...I was all saddled up..ready to go<br>
..getting coffee and eating breakfast ....and this thread kept nagging...and<br>
nagging...so I gotta throw in my nickles worth...<br>
(unsaddle...disconnect GPS...computer in Yakkity-yak mode...lite cigar...take<br>
off boots..)<br>
<p>
Now!...several things I question.<br>
<p>
1...It's easier to destroy than to create.  We'll it appears that may be<br>
so...but since nature always takes the path of least resistance<br>
(right?)...then howizzat that life exists in the first place?  I submit that<br>
there is an underlaying and contervailing force (uhhhh.....lemme<br>
see....yeah...EXTROPY)...<br>
<p>
2.  To stave off this terrible menance we gotta have a world police state,<br>
keep it a secret...yabida yabida yabida...(preachers, prophets, dictators and<br>
demagoges of all flavors been saying this forever)...<br>
<p>
Several obvious answers to this..."when it's time to Railroad...we GONNA<br>
railroad" (a much mutilated quote from early american history)...in other<br>
words when all the pieces are available...someones gonna put them together...<br>
<p>
To stop this we gotta keep it a SECRET...yeah...sure...<br>
<p>
In the seventies I was a  &lt;shhhhh&gt; CryptoMaintenance Technician for Uncle<br>
Sugar's Air Farce...uh Force.....hadda go thru 6 Crypto locks and two sets of<br>
Armed guards just to get to work...secret...TOP secret...shhhhhh<br>
<p>
Now you were saying about PGP?....better than what we had...an anyone can<br>
have it...secret got out...or was circumvented.<br>
<p>
NO!  We must &lt;forceably supress &gt; those &lt;insert group name&gt;...<br>
<p>
yeah right...is working real well in Northern Ireland...The Soviet Uniion did<br>
real well in managing their Police State..etc..etc..etc...I could go on...but<br>
this is one of those memes that so obviously won't work...yet intelligent<br>
people keep coming back to it...amazing.<br>
<p>
couple of examples of the difficulties of MAKING it work...<br>
<p>
You gonna prohibit DEEP THINKING?  Consider what could be done with<br>
intelligence augmentation..and cyberspace....suppose someone decided to<br>
"hibernate" for a few million years &lt;subjective&gt;...(a day..week or month real<br>
time) and mull over the problem of nanotech...how you gonna stop that?<br>
<p>
You gonna prohib taking a LONG WALK?   Real long...like out among the Comets<br>
in the Ooort Cloud...or farther...if someone goes out there and develops<br>
nanotech...and is pissed cause you run him off...uh-oh.<br>
<p>
An I'm still not convinced that self-replicating nano assemblers are gonna be<br>
that easy....or even possible.(yeah...well possible...like a steam powered<br>
airplane...but not practicle).. I could go into the ideas that biological<br>
nano-assemblers exists for a reason...maybe that's the onlly way that works?<br>
 Because all the components necessary are gathered together in a neat,<br>
readily available package...fuel, building components...etc.  Where as<br>
outside the biological realm this problem get greatly more difficult...sure<br>
 atoms are everywhere...but the RIGHT KINDS of atoms?  That's why we gotta<br>
process mountains of ore to get a little metal...&lt;Ever been to an open-pit<br>
copper mind?  Awesome...&lt;and I don't wann hear about it from you Enviromental<br>
Wackos...shaddap)&gt;  By the time the poor little nanoassembler got his act<br>
together the show would be over.<br>
<p>
I keep thinking of Neal Stephenson's "Diamond Age" scenario...I think that<br>
nanotech will come via the Matter Compiler route...and soon &lt;a few YEARS ago<br>
a high school science fair in California was won by.....a fully functional<br>
Scanning Tunnelling Microscope &lt;STM&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Well...that lets a little of the steam out...I had a lot more to say (I<br>
thought)...but I gotta go.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Computer back into navigational mode...initiate GPS...reel in phone<br>
line...relite Ceegar.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
