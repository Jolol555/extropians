If our social security taxes, and whatever else we wanted to save, was<br>
allowed to be invested in investments of our choice without capital<br>
gains taxes, just regular income taxes, its estimated we'd easily have<br>
10% annual growth without inflation or unemployment, and have<br>
guarranteed retirement incomes that are comfortably livable. As it is,<br>
every cent they take from us for our "security" goes right back out into<br>
the pockets of retirees who never were taxed at a level that would<br>
provide them with benefits beyond 3 years after retirement. For anyone<br>
below 35, its Social Insecurity.<br>

The AARP is the greatest threat to the security of the United States in<br>
our time.<br>
