EVIDENCE OF AN UNUSUAL MASSIVE GALAXY CLUSTER<br>
Gravitational lensing is the bending of light and other radiation<br>
by a massive gravitational entity such as a star, a black hole, a<br>
galaxy, or a cluster of galaxies. The effect is predicted by<br>
Einstein's Theory of Relativity and was first detected during a<br>
total solar eclipse by Eddington in 1919. The first example of<br>
gravitational lensing of light from a quasar was discovered in<br>
1979. The result of gravitational lensing is the production of<br>
multiple images of the lensed object. Since the radiation<br>
signature of every object in the sky is about as unique as a<br>
fingerprint, when one sees a small group of nearby images with<br>
identical radiation signatures, one concludes these are multiple<br>
images of a single entity produced by an intervening gravita-<br>
tional lens. This is the basis for a report this week by M.<br>
Hattori et al (various installations in DE, JP, US) concerning<br>
the gravitational lensing of a distant quasar (redshift parameter<br>
z=3.27). What they have deduced from the multiple-image quasar<br>
data is the existence of a massive galactic cluster gravitational<br>
lens intervening between the quasar and Earth. But when one looks<br>
for the cluster one finds only the x-ray evidence of it without<br>
the expected luminosity of galaxies in a cluster. The conclusion<br>
is that this lens is indeed a massive cluster of galaxies at<br>
redshift z=1 [corresponding to approximately 3 x 10exp(10) light<br>
years], but a cluster in which most galaxies are dark. This dark<br>
cluster of galaxies also contains a large amount of iron. It is<br>
apparently the most distant galactic cluster discovered in x-rays<br>
thus far, and the authors suggest it may be a new type of<br>
astronomical object that will require some revision of current<br>
theoretical models of the structure and history of galactic<br>
clusters. (Nature 10 July)<br>

ANALYSIS SUGGESTS SAN ANDREAS FAULT MAY BE IN A CRITICAL STATE<br>
Geophysical faulting is a break in rock structure that occurs<br>
when pressures in the Earth's crust are strong enough to cause<br>
fracture and displacement. In some faults the movement is<br>
vertical (thrust faulting), causing one side to be pushed above<br>
the other, in others the displacement is horizontal. Earthquakes<br>
usually occur at fault lines, and the relationship between the<br>
occurrence of earthquakes and existing faults is for obvious<br>
reasons an important area of research. The present consensus<br>
theory of earthquakes is the elastic rebound theory in which<br>
earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of shear strain<br>
resulting from fault slip following years of slow strain<br>
accumulation. In other words, what we call an earthquake is the<br>
result of an abrupt adjustment of accumulated strain forces<br>
produced by a discontinuity in the crust. Among the countries<br>
with a significant interest in seismology (the study of<br>
earthquakes) are China and the U.S., since both countries have<br>
experienced devastating earthquakes in the past. This week there<br>
is a report by Chi-yuen Wang and Yongen Cai (University of<br>
California Berkeley CA US, and Peking University CN) of a model<br>
analysis of the response of the California San Andreas fault to<br>
regional compression. The authors conclude that regional stresses<br>
resulting from crust plate convergence and thrust faulting in the<br>
Coastal Ranges could trigger major earthquakes on the San Andreas<br>
fault. The far from trivial intertext here is the collaboration<br>
between China and the U.S. in the study of the seismology of<br>
California. (Nature 10 July)<br>

NEW PROBE OF ATOMIC NUCLEUS PROTON-PROTON INTERACTIONS<br>
A quark is a hypothetical fundamental particle, having charges<br>
whose magnitudes are one-third or two-thirds of the electron<br>
charge, and from which the elementary particles may in theory be<br>
constructed. The quark model of the atomic nucleus, independently<br>
proposed by Gell-Man and Zweig in 1964, has now had 33 years to<br>
establish itself. The current view among nuclear physicists is as<br>
follows: each nucleus contains a population of protons and<br>
neutrons, collectively known as nucleons, as well as a host of<br>
other particles that bind the nucleons together. Each nucleon, in<br>
turn, is made up of three quarks bound by what is called the<br>
strong nuclear force. (Physicists now recognize four fundamental<br>
forces: gravity, the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear<br>
force, and the strong nuclear force.) The quark model is just<br>
that, a model, and if the model has lasted for more than 30 years<br>
it is because with it one can explain in a consistent manner the<br>
results of laboratory experiments involving the collisions of<br>
particles with atomic nuclei. But no quarks have ever been<br>
isolated, and they remain theoretical constructs. Still, if<br>
quarks do exist, if nucleons are indeed composed of more<br>
fundamental entities, there are always new strategies to be used<br>
in the laboratory to examine the interaction of nucleons with the<br>
hope of revealing their internal structures. Two weeks ago Gerco<br>
Onderwater et al (Netherlands National Institute for Nuclear and<br>
High-Energy Physics, Amsterdam NL) reported experimental results<br>
that have been called by other physicists "a fundamental<br>
milestone in the understanding of nuclear structure." In brief,<br>
what the Dutch team has done is to knock a pair of protons out of<br>
a nucleus at the moment when the proton-proton interactions are<br>
at their most intense, thus providing a method to reveal the<br>
intimate relationships between nucleons. The experiment was<br>
designed to catch two protons at a time they were so close their<br>
quark cores would be touching. Nuclear physicists are now hopeful<br>
that with such a method the mysteries of nucleons may soon be<br>
solved. (Physical Review Letters 30 June)<br>

FIRST ANALYSIS OF DNA FROM A NEANDERTHAL BONE<br>
About 10 kilometers east of Dusseldorf in Germany, in the valley<br>
of the Dussel, there is a little town called Neander. One hundred<br>
and forty-one years ago, in the summer of 1856, some workmen<br>
broke into a cave to get at the limestone inside and discovered a<br>
set of ancient bones. Most of the bones were smashed to bits by<br>
the workmen, but some of the bones, including part of the skull,<br>
survived, and the skeleton was soon recognized by anthropologists<br>
as belonging to an ancient race of men who came to be known as<br>
the Neanderthals. A Neanderthal fossil had actually been<br>
discovered some years earlier in Gibraltar, but not recognized as<br>
such. Neanderthal-like fossils have also been found in France,<br>
Spain, Italy, Yugoslavia, Iraq, China, Java, and Israel. For more<br>
than a century, one of the central questions in paleoanthropology<br>
has been whether modern man evolved from this race -- or was the<br>
Neanderthal a separate branch that became extinct? Until<br>
recently, the primary laboratory method of investigation of such<br>
a question was analysis of the morphology of bone fragments. This<br>
week, the field of paleoanthropology has apparently crossed an<br>
important watershed, as M. Krings et al (University of Munich,<br>
DE; Pennsylvania State University, US) report the first analysis<br>
of DNA from an extinct human, in this case DNA extracted from the<br>
actual Neanderthal skeleton found near Dusseldorf in 1856. The<br>
key to the investigation was the analysis of mitochondrial rather<br>
than nuclear DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is usually present in<br>
concentrations two or three orders of magnitude greater than<br>
nuclear DNA, and they were able to find enough of it still intact<br>
to amplify with the PCR technique and piece together a total DNA<br>
sequence of 379 base pairs. Comparison of this sequence with<br>
contemporary human sequences leads to the conclusion that<br>
Neanderthal and modern man are separate evolutionary lines, and<br>
that the latter did not evolve from the former. The work will<br>
have to be replicated with other Neanderthal fossils, but most<br>
paleoanthropologists are excited by the results and expect them<br>
to be confirmed. The technology of evolutionary paleoanthropology<br>
has evidently now progressed from caliper measurements of bones<br>
to measurements of bone DNA fragments. (Cell 11 July)<br>

AN INTERESTING CASE OF ANT-PLANT MUTUALISM<br>
In biology, symbiosis is an intimate and protracted association<br>
of individuals of different species, and mutualism is a type of<br>
symbiosis in which both participants receive benefits from the<br>
association. An intriguing mutualism is that between ants and<br>
Acacia trees. In East Africa, one finds Acacia trees that are<br>
"ant-guarded": the ants live on the trees inside modified thorns<br>
(pseudogalls), patrol the branches, and attack any insect or<br>
vertebrate herbivore, thus protecting the plant, but also<br>
preserving the plant for the use of the ant. But this plant<br>
requires cross-pollination by visiting insects in order to<br>
reproduce, and what one observes is that during the pollination<br>
periods the ant-guards essentially remain in the guard-house and<br>
cross-pollination by visiting insects proceeds without<br>
difficulty. Which of course provokes the question of what are the<br>
signals involved in this delicate bit of cooperative maneuvering?<br>
This week P. G. Willmer and G. N. Stone (University of St.<br>
Andrews, UK; Oxford University, UK) report that during the<br>
pollination period, the young Acacia flowers apparently release a<br>
volatile chemical that deters the ant-guards. The ants thus<br>
patrol before and after pollination, but not during the<br>
pollination period itself. (Nature 10 July)<br>

PATHOGENIC ASPECTS OF HUMAN MITOCHONDRIAL DNA<br>
One of the more remarkable structures found in eukaryote cells<br>
(cells that have internal membrane-bound organelles such as a<br>
nucleus) is the mitochondrion. An organic chemist confronting for<br>
the first time the exquisite catalytic polymer machinery in the<br>
mitochondrion cannot be faulted for experiencing vertigo. Each<br>
mitochondrion, and there can be hundreds in each living eukaryote<br>
cell, is involved in the synthesis of high-energy phosphate<br>
compounds absolutely essential to the viability of the cell and<br>
its replication, and in human mitochondria it is all done with 13<br>
different proteins and 24 different RNA molecules, all coded for<br>
by the mitochondrion's own self-replicating DNA. Which leads us<br>
to the second aspect of this biological wonder: all mitochondria<br>
are apparently the relics of primitive organisms that in the<br>
early era of the evolution of life were incorporated and coopted<br>
into eukaryotes. They have become part of the eukaryote, dividing<br>
when the eukaryote cell divides, replicating their own DNA, and<br>
thus passing as partners from one cell generation to the next.<br>
Mitochondrial genes were discovered only in 1963. And our<br>
knowledge of the pathological effects of mutations in mito-<br>
chondrial genes begins only in 1988. Most of these pathologies<br>
are quite special, but this month Douglas C. Wallace (Emory<br>
University, US), who in 1988 was the first to trace a specific<br>
disease to an inherited mutation in a mitochondrial gene,<br>
presents his view that defects (some of them perhaps preventable)<br>
in mitochondrial genes may also be involved in common medical<br>
conditions such as aging and heart disease. The first decade of<br>
the study of mitochondrial pathology is not yet finished, but we<br>
know enough now to expect the decades ahead will reveal signif-<br>
icant new insights into both the pathology and molecular biology<br>
of these remarkable structures. (Scientific American August 1997)<br>

A RECOMBINANT GENE THERAPY FOR HUMAN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS<br>
A cytokine is any substance that promotes cell growth and cell<br>
division. Certain cytokines are endogenous, and need to be<br>
controlled by cell regulatory mechanisms. When these mechanisms<br>
fail, endogenous cytokines may be implicated in serious human<br>
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, where apparently<br>
deregulated cytokines cause the inflammatory response that<br>
produces the symptoms. As a promoter of cell growth and division,<br>
a cytokine acts as a messenger to cells, and the transmission of<br>
the message requires a binding of the cytokine molecule to a<br>
cytokine-specific receptor on the cell surface. This receptor is<br>
either a protein or a protein complex or a part of a protein, and<br>
one would expect that if we could synthesize the receptor and<br>
introduce the synthesized product into the extracellular fluid,<br>
the cytokine for which this receptor is specific would bind to<br>
the receptor and be prevented from delivering its chemical signal<br>
to the cells. Test-tube synthesis of most complex proteins<br>
produced by biological cells is not yet possible, but what one<br>
can do, after calculating the DNA code for the active part of the<br>
receptor protein, is incorporate the necessary DNA sequence into<br>
the genome of some mammalian cell line, and have these cells act<br>
as chemical factories to produce the cytokine receptor that we<br>
are unable to synthesize otherwise. We then gather the factory<br>
product, administer it to the patient, and expect the cytokine<br>
receptor to bind its specific cytokine in extracellular fluid and<br>
thus reverse the course of the disease. This is essentially what<br>
"recombinant gene therapy" is all about. It is a field less than<br>
a decade old, and like all fields involving clinical medicine, it<br>
moves slowly because procedures that involve human patients must<br>
be carefully developed. This week, Larry W. Moreland et al (12<br>
authors at various installations, US) report the successful<br>
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with a recombinant human<br>
cytokine receptor complex produced by the method outlined above.<br>
It is a beginning. Like all treatments involving recombinant gene<br>
therapy, much work needs to be done. But the path ahead is clear,<br>
and there is an expectation of important results from this area<br>
of clinical medicine. (New England Journal of Medicine 17 July)<br>

A RESURGENCE IN CUBA OF A DANGEROUS MOSQUITO<br>
Dengue is a human disease caused by a virus, which in turn is<br>
transmitted by a mosquito (Aedes aegypti) through a mosquito<br>
bite. In some place, the disease may be called "breakbone fever"<br>
or "dandy Fever". The disease is endemic throughout the tropics<br>
and subtropics, and in adults an attack of dengue fever usually<br>
lasts several weeks and then it passes. There is a variant,<br>
however, that infects children, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and<br>
this has a mortality rate of as much as 30%, most deaths<br>
occurring in infants less than a year old. Dengue hemorrhagic<br>
fever is prevalent in Southeast Asia, China, and Cuba. An<br>
important fact about the disease vector, the mosquito Aedes<br>
aegypti, is that it likes to breed around human dwellings and in<br>
man-made containers. Which leads to the expectation that dengue<br>
could be eradicated by a concerted effort to eliminate containers<br>
and other man-made debris used by the breeding mosquito. Such<br>
concerted efforts have been underway now for 50 years, and<br>
apparently they have all failed and the mosquito Aedes aegypti<br>
has been victorious. This week there is a report of a serious<br>
outbreak of dengue in Santiago, Cuba, with estimates of the<br>
number of cases as high as 30,000. (Science 11 July) <br>
