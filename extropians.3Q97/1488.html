[SNIP of a long rant]<br>
<p>
This is a troll, isn't it?     :-)<br>
<p>
1) every language since COBOL was supposed to put programmers<br>
out of business. Really. Sorry, but the ability to<br>
construct algorithms requires logical thought processes.<br>
The algorithm designer is a programmer, no matter what<br>
tools are used. In the hands of a competent programmer,<br>
better tools lead to higher productivity and better<br>
programs. In the hands of a non-programmer, better tools<br>
lead to nothing much. I do agree that simpler-to-use tools<br>
lower the learning barrier, but a 5-year-old using Pilot<br>
logically is a programmer, while a company president using<br>
Excel illogically is not.<br>
<p>
2) Over the years, there have been many examples of<br>
programming tools integrated in various ways into an operating<br>
system or operating environment. I'm not clear on the<br>
distinction you are trying to make here: Why do you<br>
think UNIX has integrated tools, but Windows does not?<br>
both environments have a distinct OS and Distinct tools.<br>
<p>
3) There are a lot of free OSs with freely-available source<br>
code. Linux is a good place to start.<br>
<p>
4) Java is the latest and likely the greatest attempt to<br>
achieve true reusability and ease of visual programming.<br>
The javaBeans specification is specifically designed<br>
to permit easy visual programming, and vendor independence<br>
is central to the Java philosophy. Yo can download the<br>
Java Development Kit and the Beans devlopment Kit for free.<br>
