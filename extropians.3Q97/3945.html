Its funny, people from other countries are dumbfounded when they hear<br>
that US citizens are the most generous of their time and money of<br>
anybody in the world. THis is because when an individual pays less of<br>
their income to government theives, they tend to see charity as an<br>
individual responsibility that comes with greater economic freedom.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I doubt that they'd have as much power as governments do now,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and governments often harm everyone (the consumers and general</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; public) but themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In all your messages there is a hate towards government, I also despise</i><br>
<i>&gt; politicians but don't corporations 'own' the government, even in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; U.S.? It's the same thing, the same problem.</i><br>
<p>
THe US economy, despite the claims of politicians, is not a free market,<br>
though it is among the closest of any nation in existence to a free<br>
market. Our economy is a mercantilist economy due to one short little<br>
clause in our Constitution: "congress shall regulate interstate<br>
commerce". Due to this, businesses that grow strong can use their<br>
profits to fund lobbyists and politicians to pass regulations and laws<br>
that aid and protect big business. The so called Anti-Trust laws are<br>
merely to prevent any one corporation from growing larger and more<br>
powerful than the Federal government.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll be honest, I don't know what negative feedback is and I know</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing of basic economics but I always knew that "united we stand,</i><br>
<i>&gt; divided we fall". If a corporation starts achieving a substantial</i><br>
<i>&gt; advantage towards everyone else, as it grows, it will eventually become</i><br>
<i>&gt; more efficient, more capable, will be able to have the most competitive</i><br>
<i>&gt; prices and therefore, will achieve a monopoly status. Right? (I see that</i><br>
<i>&gt; in Portugal every time, small shops complaining about big commercial</i><br>
<i>&gt; centers and supermarkets)</i><br>
<p>
And what sort of economy does Portugal have? The negative feedback is<br>
that big business is less capable of innovation and rapid market<br>
response than small business, due to their big investments in current<br>
technology and deep management heirarchy. EXAMPLE: IBM. So the more a<br>
big business tries to dominate, the more it will try to dampen<br>
technological growth, which is opposed by pressure by small businesses<br>
that can offer new technology. EXAMPLES: RAILROADS vs. Ford Motor Co. in<br>
1900, IBM vs. Apple in 1980.<br>

<i>&gt; I think that this sentence is a good example of a very important detail</i><br>
<i>&gt; you seem to forget.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In this list, and even in the internet, the average person is from a</i><br>
<i>&gt; much higher social scale and much higher intellectual level than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rest of the population. IMHO, most persons are stupid, plain stupid.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Besides, many persons are also selfish and greedy. The consumer, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; common citizen doesn't know and doesn't care about environmental issues.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll give you an example, one of the first countries to urge for serious</i><br>
<i>&gt; measures to prevent global warming was Holland. Why? Not for altruistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons, of course, but because part of Holland is below sea level, land</i><br>
<i>&gt; conquered to the sea by dams.</i><br>
<p>
So it was the threat to their very lives? I dunno, we in the US have<br>
done some pretty good positive environmental things via market pressure.<br>
EXAMPLES: Recycling, Dolphin Safe Tuna, BGH free milk (which is opposed<br>
by big argri-corps and governments).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You talk about how the market will control big corporations and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; millions of consumers will lead the market into the best path, let me</i><br>
<i>&gt; ask you something, why is government so corrupt? People theoretically</i><br>
<i>&gt; control government (by voting) and still government is corrupt, why is</i><br>
<i>&gt; that? What makes you think that indirect control of economy by persons</i><br>
<i>&gt; is going to improve anything?</i><br>
<p>
Because government concentrates power in the hands of the few,<br>
corrupting the powerful rapidly, while indirect control dilutes power<br>
into digestible, uncorruptible bite sizes for everyone.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; EvMick says that free-market works, my question is for whom, for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; persons who are already wealthy or for the ones who are poor and have</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing?</i><br>
<p>
When one uses a dynamic scoring model to measure the effect of taxation<br>
on disposable income, one sees that ANY tax imposed has a far far<br>
greater effect on the poor than on the rich, even when it is as highly<br>
progressive as the Swedish system. Only a system that was scaled such<br>
that the person making an average income paid nothing, with money from<br>
those posessing or earning above average wealth flowing directly to<br>
those below average on a sliding scale, with a 100% efficiency of<br>
redistribution would not have a regressive impact on those below average<br>
more so than on the above average. <br>
<p>
Since capital generates a surplus when invested freely, and government<br>
confiscation almost always earns less than is spent (a few notable<br>
exceptions like the space program, etc. had nothing to do with welfare<br>
economics), the fact that the wealthy are getting wealthier faster than<br>
the poor are getting wealthy is unimportant when you simply examine<br>
disposable income against a fixed standard of living. Liberals claim<br>
that income here in the US is shrinking for  the poorer people, but they<br>
don't mention that they consistently raise the yardstick of the<br>
"standard of living" while at the same time overstating the real level<br>
of inflation. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since unselfish reasons rarely incentives anyone to do anything, let me</i><br>
<i>&gt; ask you something, do you think that the poorer classes generated by</i><br>
<i>&gt; free-markets will stand still? My bet is that they'll riot and that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; what I fear.</i><br>
<p>
In a free capital market, economic growth is mostly restricted by the<br>
rate of expansion of labor resources. If people riot at all, it will be<br>
because they cannot get enough free time. In the late 80's, the biggest<br>
strike in Boeing history occured not because of bad pay or conditions,<br>
but because they were forced to work too much overtime. THe workers had<br>
saved so much money from working so much and not having time to spend it<br>
that they struck for something like 100 days or so. They finally won the<br>
concession from Boeing limiting them to 275 hours of overtime a quarter<br>
each.<br>

Yes I do, usually 3-6 books a week.<br>
