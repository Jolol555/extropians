I'd want to see the raw data, but my guess would be that<br>
variability of intelligence is extremely sensitive to neonatal<br>
environment. Adopted children probably have a more disruptive<br>
neonatal environment, and even adopted children "reared<br>
together" may have drastically non-correlated neonatal<br>
experiences.<br>
<p>
If the study binned data from adopted children "reared together"<br>
who were adopted at ages as old as four or five, then that would<br>
certainly explain the low correlation. Intelligence seems to be<br>
far more sensitive to the environment in the first five years than<br>
it is to environment in later childhood. A closer look at the data<br>
and the collection methodology would be needed to resolve this<br>
particular question.<br>
<p>
It all depends on the age of the children at which the period<br>
of "being reared together" began.<br>
