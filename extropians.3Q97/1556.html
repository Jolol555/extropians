<p>
Here is another excerpt which I thought was an interesting take on a subject<br>
we have often discussed:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Q39  Is linearity exact?</i><br>
<i>&gt;      -------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt; Linearity (of the wavefunction) has been verified to hold true to better</i><br>
<i>&gt; than 1 part in 10^27 [W].  If slight non-linear effects were ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; discovered then the possibility of communication with, or travel to, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other worlds would be opened up.  The existence of parallel Everett-</i><br>
<i>&gt; worlds can be used to argue that physics must be *exactly* linear, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-linear effects will never be detected.  (See "Is physics linear" for</i><br>
<i>&gt; more about linearity.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The argument for exactness uses a version of the weak anthropic</i><br>
<i>&gt; principle and proceeds thus: the exploitation of slight non-linear</i><br>
<i>&gt; quantum effects could permit communication with and travel to the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; Everett-worlds.  A sufficiently advanced "early" civilisation [F] might</i><br>
<i>&gt; colonise uninhabited other worlds, presumably in an exponentially</i><br>
<i>&gt; spreading fashion.  Since the course of evolution is dictated by random</i><br>
<i>&gt; quantum events (mutations, genetic recombination) and environmental</i><br>
<i>&gt; effects (asteroidal induced mass extinctions, etc) it seems inevitable</i><br>
<i>&gt; that in a minority, although still a great many, of these parallel</i><br>
<i>&gt; worlds life on Earth has already evolved sapient-level intelligence and</i><br>
<i>&gt; developed an advanced technology millions or even billions of years ago. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Such early arrivals, under the usual Darwinian pressure to expand, would</i><br>
<i>&gt; spread across the parallel time tracks, if they had the ability,</i><br>
<i>&gt; displacing their less-evolved quantum neighbours.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The fossil record indicates that evolution, in our ancestral lineage,</i><br>
<i>&gt; has proceeded at varying rates at different times.  Periods of rapid</i><br>
<i>&gt; development in complexity (eg the Cambrian explosion of 530 millions</i><br>
<i>&gt; years ago or the quadrupling of brain size during the recent Ice Ages)</i><br>
<i>&gt; are interspersed with long periods of much slower development.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; indicates that we are not in the fast lane of evolution, where all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; lucky breaks turned out just right for the early development of</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence and technology.  Ergo none of the more advanced</i><br>
<i>&gt; civilisations that exist in other worlds have ever been able to cross</i><br>
<i>&gt; from one quantum world to another and interrupt our long, slow</i><br>
<i>&gt; biological evolution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The simplest explanation is that physics is sufficiently linear to</i><br>
<i>&gt; prevent travel between Everett worlds.  If technology is only bounded</i><br>
<i>&gt; by physical law (the Feinberg principle [F]) then linearity would have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be exact.</i><br>
<p>
Here he is essentially using the Fermi paradox to prove that travel to<br>
other parallel Everett worlds is impossible.  Of course, the same argument<br>
proves either that travel to other stars is impossible, or that there are<br>
no other civilizations within our past light cone.<br>
<p>
Many people believe that neither of these is the case, and that the Fermi<br>
paradox must have some other explanation.  The same belief would invalidate<br>
the claim that MW implies quantum linearity.<br>
