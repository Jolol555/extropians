It's a problem allright. Big one.<br>
<p>

<i> &gt;(crashes, silly results, inaccurate records, etc.)</i><br>
<p>
This has already started. <br>
A few months ago a large European distributer lost several million dollars<br>
because their inventory system labeled product for destruction that had an<br>
experation date 2000 or later (the system interpreted this as 1900 so the<br>
product were several decades over-date). The labeled products were<br>
automatically moved from the warehouse to a container bound for a<br>
destruction-site.<br>
This company had received a letter warning them for this problem in 1988,<br>
the management just sat on it and now they are implementing a new system<br>
round-the-clock in 3 8-hour shifts. The company won't be making much profit<br>
this year, or next year.<br>
<p>
This is just the tip of the iceberg, many interesting things will happen in<br>
the coming 2.3 years.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The problem interests</i><br>
<i> &gt;me insofar as we have less than three years to solve it. Enough time?</i><br>
<p>
Recently a governement study in the UK showed there was a shortage of more<br>
than 300.000 programmers (about 1 million man-years) to make all software<br>
being used by companies in the country year 2K-compliant.<br>
<p>
IBM has already sent all of it's customers a letter advising them to begin<br>
a year 2K program *today* if have not started one already. They also stated<br>
that they would be unable as of june this year to assist anyone in any way<br>
because all available personell has been allocated until the end of 2001.<br>
Several sofware companies are training newly-hired personell in programming<br>
languages like COBOL (an outdated programminglanguage that was widely used<br>
in the last 25 years or so). In spite of the high investment in<br>
human-capital they expect to make a big profit when mission-critical<br>
systems come crashing down. <br>
<p>
A few years ago it correcting a progam cost about $1 per-line-of-code<br>
(programs can be several million lines long), by now it's about $10. That<br>
is if you can still find a capable programmer that has unallocated time<br>
between now and 2000.<br>
<p>
If you use custom-made programs that were written ten or more years ago,<br>
check if they are year-2K compliant *now*. This deadline is solid!<br>
