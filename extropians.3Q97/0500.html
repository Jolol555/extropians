Yes, but I doubt it would be in real life (after the initial stage of<br>
being tended by people in white coats). See Drexler's EoC.<br>
<p>
[Aside: Greg Bear likely made it expensive to tone it down in his<br>
story (which wasn't about nanotech) - cheap, ubiquitious nanotech<br>
changes things too much, and most authors realize they cannot handle<br>
all the implications. Linda Nagata and Neal Stephenson are so far the<br>
only authors I have read who have tried to explore the possibilities.<br>
I have myself limited nanotech in a science fiction game I'm working<br>
on just to keep the setting somewhat familiar. ]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; By self-replicating the "flavor" of the term was (to me) in the biological</i><br>
<i>&gt; sense. Like bacteria eating all the food available.  Not in the industrial</i><br>
<i>&gt; sense like the automovile industry (for example) replicating factories first</i><br>
<i>&gt; in order to "birth" automobiles.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but is there a difference between an insect making new insects<br>
and a factory complex building more factory complexes (remember the<br>
NASA plans for replicating moon factories). <br>
<p>
To get nanotech of the ground you need to be able to build<br>
nanodevices cheaply - if every assembler has to be built "by hand" by<br>
a STM they will be astronomically expensive and inconvenient. But if<br>
you have *one* assembler, you could use it to build another<br>
assembler. Now you have two... soon you can have as many assemblers<br>
as you want, and nanotech production becomes reasonable. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The matter compiler (santa claus box...assembler field) is intrigueing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; me....it  somehow seems to offer greater controll..less danger...Mataglap</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nano is pretty scary.</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't fear the Goo That Ate The Earth, it is somewhat unlikely<br>
(it needs energy to convert stuff into itself, limiting its speed a<br>
lot; I'm not sure biomass or diamondoid is the most energetic, but we<br>
only have around 1 kW/m^2 of sunlight). What is more dangerous is The<br>
Little Nanite Who Could - imagine an escaped medical nanite killing<br>
certain kinds of bacteria rather efficiently, spreading out of<br>
control. It might destroy our ecosystem without us noticing until it<br>
was too late.<br>
<p>
The Matter Compiler will not prevent the creation of goo or dangerous<br>
nano, but it will provide a good consumer interface for the products<br>
of nanotechnology. After all, most computer users never write<br>
programs, they just download them from the net or buy them in a<br>
store. The real danger comes from the programmers, who might write<br>
viruses or make mistakes that crash your hard drive or ecosystem.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; But what about a variation on the Penning Trap?...In a zero-g enviroment</i><br>
<i>&gt; could not atoms be positioned appropriately via laser beams?...Wouldn't this</i><br>
<i>&gt; be much easier to build than the other varients?</i><br>
<p>
No, since you need to keep both the building blocks and the object<br>
under construction floating together. So when you try to push an atom<br>
in place, the laser will also push at the object; it *might* be<br>
possible to solve the control problem, but I doubt it. This method<br>
doesn't seem to work well for massive structures, only individual<br>
atoms, molecules or optical crystals. <br>
