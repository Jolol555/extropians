For those tied to the notion that computers will make firms smaller, <br>
the following paper argues that the situation is lots more complex. Robin<br>

     Since the 1970s, economists have speculated on the effects of<br>
     the proliferation of new computer and communications<br>
     capabilities on business structure and performance. The<br>
     present analysis explores information technology's (IT)<br>
     relationship to employment and firm structure by examining<br>
     how IT affects the relative size of employment at auxiliary<br>
     units. The analysis treats auxiliary units--establishments<br>
     where employees provide support services (mainly<br>
     administrative) to production establishments--as a proxy for<br>
     the highest administrative levels of the organizational<br>
     hierarchy. Changes in the relative size of auxiliary<br>
     employment give a broad indication of IT-related changes in<br>
     firm structure. Statistical analyses of 46 industries show<br>
     large variations across industries in the size, sign, and<br>
     statistical significance of the elasticities of auxiliary<br>
     unit employment shares with respect to IT capital stock<br>
     shares. We find no economy-wide trends associated with IT.<br>
     There is too much variation among industries to rely on<br>
     estimates obtained from pooling industry data. For the most<br>
     part, sectorial trends are scarce. Only in the transportation<br>
     sector do the sign and statistical significance suggest that<br>
     IT related changes are similar. Ultimately, the enormous<br>
     variation revealed by our results suggests that one cannot<br>
     make economy-wide generalizations about the effects of IT.<br>
<p>
     Nevertheless, our results, combined with other evidence,<br>
     suggest that economies of scale--gained from using IT to<br>
     reduce coordination and monitoring costs--influence firm size<br>
     and structure. One reason why the effects of IT are so<br>
     different across industries is variation in the firm size<br>
     distribution across industries prior to the IT revolution:<br>
     1) For industries with a predominance of small firms, IT-<br>
     related economies of scale may encourage growth in firm size<br>
     and lead to an increase in the relative size of centralized<br>
     back office establishments across the industry. This appears<br>
     to have occurred in the retail trade industry. 2) In some<br>
     industries where large firms predominate, IT may induce<br>
     greater efficiency in back-office jobs, enabling firms to<br>
     reduce back office employment relative to total employment.<br>
     This appears to have occurred in some of the transportation<br>
     industries. 3) In industries where IT primarily substitutes<br>
     for production workers, auxiliary unit employment share is<br>
     likely to rise because central administration office<br>
     employment tends to change less than proportionately in<br>
     response to changes in overall employment. This appears to<br>
     have occurred in the primary metals industry.<br>
