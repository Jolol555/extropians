An asteroid could hit in a matter of seconds, we wouldn't have much chance of<br>
survival.  The influx of nanotechnology will be a slow and controlled<br>
process, new technologies are always looked upon with caution.  If<br>
destructive nanites were released today that would be an 'enormous disaster'.<br>
 But nanotech will slowly find its way into everyday life, the ability to<br>
create and protect will increase with the ability to destroy.  It's likely<br>
that destructive nanotech could be nothing more than a cold when up against<br>
our advanced immune systems.  These immune systems could have far more<br>
computing power than any nanite, and will be able to outwit even the most<br>
advanced destructive force.  And why keep the immune system within the body?<br>
 It could do survailence work, tell you if any nukes are being built in your<br>
area and launch a preemptive strike!<br>
<p>
Before we start uploading ourselves and only communicating with the outside<br>
world via democratic robots, think of nanotech's ability to update us.  If<br>
only 1 in a million people are crazy enough and clever enough to 'goo' us,<br>
then network the million sane minds to create a defensive system.  Putting<br>
the power in the hands of one person or one organisation is a great way to<br>
get yourself killed.  Distributing that power through the masses may seem<br>
like suicide, but it's the only route to survival.<br>
