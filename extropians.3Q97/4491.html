I've been commissioned to compile a selection of published science fiction<br>
short stories on the theme of `travel'.  Anyone got any favorites they'd<br>
care to suggest?  One problem is that I can't really choose too many pieces<br>
over 7500 or 10,000 words in length, which tends to knock out some of the<br>
obvious choices - good stories by Kim Stanley Robinson and Lucius Shepard,<br>
say.  <br>
<p>
Some examples of the kind of thing I'm looking at (and bear in mind that I<br>
haven't yet even approached the authors with my proposal!) are:<br>
<p>
Robert Silverbeg's alternative-universe classic `Trips'<br>
Gary Kilworth's `Let's Go to Golgotha!'<br>
Brian Aldiss's `The Difficulties in Climbing Nix Olympica' (and yes, both<br>
he and I and the characters know it's realy Olympus Mons)<br>
Phil Farmer's `Sail On! Sail On!'<br>
Ursula Le Guin's `Sur'<br>
Arthur Clarke's `Wall of Darkness'<br>
<p>
Any ideas?  I'm especially eager to list some stories by women sf writers.<br>
(Suggestions can be good ole classics or hot-off-the-presses newies, but<br>
I'd appreciate a mention of where the pieces can be found.)  Obviously<br>
nearly all space-travel and time-travel fiction falls into the net in a<br>
general way, but for most that's just an enabling device, a way of getting<br>
to the interesting problems or novelties or scientific and moral issues.  I<br>
want to concentrate on the joys and horrors of the travel process itself, of<br>
<p>
			Traveling<br>
			Light-<br>
			years<br>
<p>
(If this particular conversation is deemed out of place for the extropian<br>
list, my apologies.  People could get back to me off-list if that's<br>
preferable.)<br>
