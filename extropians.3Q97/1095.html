No, he's saying that things which don't exist in reality can exist only as<br>
concepts in our mind.<br>

<p>
Yes.  I can find a chair in physical reality.  I've yet to find a Mandelbrot<br>
set, and have strong reasons to believe I'll never find one.  The Mandelbrot<br>
set is more analogous to the *concept* of chair, which also exists only in<br>
our minds.  In this case, however, there are no representations.<br>
