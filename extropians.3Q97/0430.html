At this point yes, though recent RedHat, Debian, and whatnots are<br>
purported to be suprisingly painless to install. Even the process of<br>
recompiling the kernel could be hidden from the user (but it is backwards,<br>
there must be a better way to load modules at runtime). <br>

The point is where Linux is heading towards, or, rather, where Microsoft<br>
is _not_ heading towards. The dynamics is very exciting. It can be<br>
extrapolated that a few years from now both the installation, the kernel,<br>
the interoperability, and the supplied software base will make Wintel look<br>
very paltry in comparison (unless they improve mightily, which they so <br>
far have failed to provide). Intel chipsets can't cache more then 64 <br>
MBytes, haha. Pentium II can't cache more than 512 MBytes, hihi. <br>
Braindead hardware, fit to run zombie OSses and bureau apps. There are <br>
even users (zombies?) who like it.<br>

Why bother emulating a kludge? Future software will be mostly done in <br>
Java, anyway.<br>

<p>
Microsoft never produces anything new, it's axiomatic. It's products<br>
resemble shiny apples, rotten at the core. Good to look at, horrible to<br>
eat. If you think Helios was nice, take a look at Taos. It's real, but<br>
their marketing is a desaster. <br>
