First off, I'll note that you have no response to or are purposely<br>
ignoring  the REAL statistics I posted to support my arguments, while<br>
you continue to badger Mr. Butler, who has not posted the sources of his<br>
facts about police related shootings.<br>
<p>
The only studies of improper use of firearms under stress that I am<br>
aware of is studies of AMerican troops in Vietnam. They shot over 9,000<br>
rounds on average in order to kill one VC, and normally, 4 out of five<br>
infantrymen never even fired their guns when in a firefight, they<br>
typically just tried to cover their asses. I think these data are more<br>
important in the context of why we had such trouble in that war, and<br>
that the source of this poor performance was more morale related. Most<br>
grunts just did not want to be there and wanted to live long enough to<br>
go home. This has nothing to do with self defense of ones home, person,<br>
or dependents, with firearms, unless the study also examined the<br>
performance of VC troops in defending their homes from the imperialist<br>
agressors, which it did not.<br>
<p>
The facts are that over 2.4 million crimes are prevented each year,<br>
according to one statistic I've seen (I don't have the source with me<br>
but I'll dig it up), by the use of firearms by private citizens. This is<br>
typically not reported because 95% or more of the time, nobody is hurt<br>
as the crook typically runs away or is peacefully subdued. THe media<br>
only likes to publish stories of people getting killed by guns, not<br>
being saved by guns. This is why  they always use a gun logo when a news<br>
anchor is reporting a crime, to subliminally implant in viewers minds<br>
the idea that guns=crime. As Goebbels said, "repeat a lie often enough,<br>
and people will beleive it."<br>
<p>
I take it from your posts that you are a combat veteran. If so, I highly<br>
suggest that you seek out the help of a mental health expert to treat<br>
your combat related gunshy neurosis. Only once this is done can you<br>
develop a realistic evaluation of the value of guns in society.<br>
<p>
