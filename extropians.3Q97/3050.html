[If you don't care about dying, why even bother with uploading at all?<br>
There are<br>
easier and cheaper ways to kill yourself, like doing nothing at all, for<br>
example].<br>
<p>
Maybe it doesn't bother you because you "know" you exist here and now, and<br>
that your memories are real and your own. The new "you" (the uploaded<br>
duplicate) will probably think the same, but that doesn't change the fact<br>
that he/she/it is almost certainly a fake, a clone/twin whatever, but not<br>
*you*, because you are *dead* due to massive and irreversible brain injury.<br>
Suicide on the threshold of the new age, <br>
to put it dramatically. "Direct" uploading might very well become the<br>
number one cause of death among progressive individuals in the 21st century<br>
;)<br>
<p>
Why take this enormous risk with direct uploading when you can do the whole<br>
process gradually and without ever losing your consciousness, IMO the best<br>
safeguard against "forgery". <br>
<p>
The direct vs gradual uploading dilemma (which kind of reminds of religious<br>
disputes) may be more serious than the killer goo problem, because<br>
virtually<br>
no-one really wants global destruction, but many will be queueing (like <br>
lemmings?) to get their fast upload, and (more seriously) this will<br>
probably be<br>
the method of choice for the reanimation of suspension patients (who'll<br>
thus be killed without having given their consent). Of course, they'll<br>
probably never know<br>
what hit them...and their duplicates will live happily ever after. Hmm...<br>
