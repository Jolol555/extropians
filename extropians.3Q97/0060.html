Kathryn Aegis quoted:<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Gerhard Richter, painter and essayist:</i><br>
<p>
and Joshua McMichael retorted by quoting:<br>
<i>&gt; Ayn Rand, writer and philosopher:</i><br>
<p>
A fairly reasonable synthesis of these two views (at least reasonable<br>
enough for me to be experimenting with recently) is philosophical<br>
pluralism. The first paragraph from Rand is a fairly solid argument:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; his only alternative is whether the philosophy guiding him is to be </i><br>
<i>&gt; choosen by his mind or by chance</i><br>
<p>
but this last bit is unfortunately not so clear a distinction as<br>
we might want, as long as the nature of 'mind' lies buried in the<br>
mysteries of neuroscience and the ceaseless controversies of<br>
psychology. (Nonetheless, I agree with the first paragraph.)<br>
<p>
It seems to me that having worked out in one's mind several different<br>
self-consistent (but not necessarily mutually consistent) philosophies<br>
from which one can choose according to the dictates of reason and<br>
the situation in which one finds oneself, is a great advantage. So<br>
philosophical analysis, exploration, and argument is useful and<br>
even vital, but *commitment* to one particular philosophy or ideology<br>
is perhaps not.<br>
<p>
The current hardware platform on which most philosophers run is<br>
Linguistic Monkey 3.24, and I don't see any particular reason to<br>
think that this kludge should be capable of intellectual mastery<br>
of the cosmos in some final, absolute philosophical sense.  (Although<br>
the Buddhists keep looking to me like either they're onto something,<br>
or on something.) To err is human, and refusing to commit to one<br>
particular philosophy or ideology is refusing to commit to our own<br>
errors. I prefer to let my errors die in my stead, rather than<br>
resolutely maintaining them to the last, and I'm fairly sure that<br>
all of my current philosophies will have been demonstrated erroneous<br>
within a few centuries. Call it a hunch, if you like. (If I'm lucky,<br>
I'll have come up with their replacements long before my rivals<br>
have written their refutations. ;)<br>
<p>
In the meantime, I get by with the tools (philosophies) that I've<br>
got, and try to use the right tool for the job that happens to be<br>
in front of me at the moment. I am well aware that this treads<br>
dangerously close to instrumentalism, and having long been dissatisfied<br>
with the simpler varieties of instrumentalism myself, I'm not too<br>
happy with it either. This dissatisfaction, though, is quite<br>
satisfactory to me, because without it I might become a dogmatic<br>
instrumentalist, and that would be simply dreadful. There are few<br>
philosophical positions I can imagine that seem worse than dogmatic<br>
mushymindedness.<br>
<p>
I am also well aware that openly espousing such a radically<br>
pluralistic philosophical stance might cause some to call my<br>
integrity into question. All I have to say about this is that I<br>
try to base my judgements of the integrity of others on my<br>
observation of their actions more than on my observation of the<br>
philosophical arguments they write. Perhaps this is a mistake,<br>
but it's my current policy.<br>
