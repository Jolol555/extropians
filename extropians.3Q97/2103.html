<p>
<i>&gt;I was looking for explanations which could plausibly be given</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolutionary foundations.  I don't see the evolutionary function of</i><br>
<i>&gt;just wanting to argue for argument's sake.</i><br>
<p>
I reread my posts, and if I had much of an idea along those lines,<br>
I don't see it.  Argument for argument's sake is like play: a kind of<br>
practice, the advantage of which would just be that it keeps you in<br>
shape for real thinking.  There's a potential arms-race effect (a<br>
setting for faster learning) in argument.<br>
<p>
Another function could be to occupy your mind and keep out<br>
presumably dangerous thoughts.  To argue<br>
that you'd have to pull in some complicated Freud-like stuff.<br>
<p>
Another might be that you get hooked on continuing arguments and<br>
that glues you to certain people, and *that* has advantages.<br>
<p>
I don't know if you were looking for specifically *interesting*<br>
functions.  Sometimes life is boring and ad-hoc, though.<br>
<p>
I can see arguments for the phenomenon's *own* evolutionary interest,<br>
*against* those of its hosts, but that's not what you're asking.  In<br>
fact you'd want to ask why we don't have defenses *against* parlor<br>
conversation, if it were a truly parasitic waste of time and energy.<br>
<p>
I certainly don't!!  Nyak nyak har har!  What do YOU think, Robin!?<br>
