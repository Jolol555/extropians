<i>&gt; &gt; Let us examine a specific case of genetic error, cancer:</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Would you say that the reason sharks don't get cancer is because they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have a simple genome?  Firstly, I'd have a hard time calling sharks</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; primitive.  I would, however, call a number of plants primitive, all of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which have been known to develop tumors.  As human beings, we have a more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; complicated and prone-to-error genome, but we also have more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sophisticated ways of dealing with these errors-- apparently, so do</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sharks. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I have another quibble in the form of a question:  can you think of an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; organism more primitive than a shark that DOES age?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; All this said, in principle, I agree with what you're trying to say.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thanks, obviously I was generalizing and there are many exceptions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; IMHO, what happened was that some species evolved to correct their</i><br>
<i>&gt; genetic errors while others evolved to become more complex and therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; having more errors (and, of course, some species evolved to become more</i><br>
<i>&gt; complex and more perfect, others hardly evolved, etc). It can be argued</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we correct more errors than sharks but since we are more complex,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we have more errors and we will age while sharks don't.</i><br>
<p>
If you admit you were generalizing, do you retract your statement that<br>
human cells are neccessarily more difficult to cryosuspend than other<br>
cells with smaller genome? (I see you have deleted this statement from<br>
your post)<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  IMHO,</i><br>
<p>
What does IMHO mean, I've always wondered.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; their evolution lead them to correct the errors in their genome while</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; our evolution made us consecutively more complex</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Are you saying their evolution *did not* make them consecutively more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; complex?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not in the same way as us. Our species appeared about 100 000 years ago</i><br>
<i>&gt; while other species (such as alligators, etc) appeared much before. Of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course that evolution made them more complex but at a lower rate than us</i><br>
<i>&gt; and made them more 'perfect'.</i><br>
<p>
I'd like to hear your definition of "complex" and "perfect" as it pertains<br>
to this statement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; BTW, sharks do get cancer, they get it a</i><br>
<i>&gt; much lower rate than us but they naturally get it.</i><br>
<p>
Really?  Live and learn.  When was this discovered?<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Transferring? Transferring what? Your brain? Your 'soul'?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The functioning and abilities of my brain.  I would call this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "consciousness"  Some might argue with my use of this word.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I continue not understanding what are you trying to say.</i><br>
<i>&gt; "consciousness", what is that?</i><br>
<p>
Look above and you will see the answer to your question.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is it something physical such as all your</i><br>
<i>&gt; memory proteins (I remember reading somewhere about the existence of</i><br>
<i>&gt; memory proteins but I'm not sure), the positions and connections between</i><br>
<i>&gt; your neurons?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From my limited knowledge of neurophysiology, I would say that appears to</i><br>
have something to do with it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is it something spiritual?</i><br>
<p>
Please tell me... how exactly to you pull "something spiritual" from my<br>
above phrase "functioning and abilities of my brain"???  If you think the<br>
functioning and abilities of your brain are "spiritual" and unknowable,<br>
then I cannot debate with you, because your ideas have been cemented by<br>
faith.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is it something like, the design and constitution of your networks of</i><br>
<i>&gt; neurons that can (or will) be duplicated on a computer to make it think</i><br>
<i>&gt; like you?</i><br>
<p>
Sounds feasible to me.    But you never know.. this is the great thing<br>
about not having faith... infinite possibilities ;)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; One idea (that I already though about years ago) is to increase the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; viability of our neurons with metal or whatever but this is a continuos</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; process. Just like now, the atoms that compose my neurons are not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; same that were a few hours ago, exception made to some molecules such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; DNA, our neuron's atoms change continually and I don't complain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Connecting memory chips to our brain might not be a bad idea but that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; a change and not a transfer. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If your brain ends up in the same state after a series of "changes" or one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; single transfer, what, exactly, is the difference?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It has to do with identity, singularity or individuality. I already</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussed that a couple of messages ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Say, let's suppose you suffer a terrible accident and lose a part of</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain changing your personality. Are you the same person you were?</i><br>
<p>
You're different.  But, as has been discussed before on this list, you are<br>
also different after drinking a cup of coffee.  If your body stays the<br>
same through time, you are dead.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This idea you "thought about years ago"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is called "nano-replacement"  Look it up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Really, I didn't knew that. For much you come up with weird ideas, there</i><br>
<i>&gt; will always be someone out there thinking the same thing. I used to</i><br>
<i>&gt; think I was the only crazy lunatic trying to fight aging! Well, I'm the</i><br>
<i>&gt; only guy I know in Portugal who does.</i><br>
<p>
Do women in Portugal get faces-lifts?  Do they use anti-wrinkle cream?  Do<br>
they dye their hair? I'm sure you must know one of them.<br>
<p>
I think you'll find the majority of people want to fight aging. The<br>
majority of people also want to die, when it is "their time."  Weird,<br>
isn't it?<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Obviously, before uploading can be achieved, we have to understand all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; functioning of neurons that contribute to consciousness and then be able</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ot duplicate those functions on another platform.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Let's suppose that someone builds another platform thinking exactly like</i><br>
<i>&gt; you. Say, a computer. Note that you are not dead, you are looking at a</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer who thinks just like you, is this computer you? What if you're</i><br>
<i>&gt; dead? What if your brain is destroyed while the computer is built?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Let's suppose you build another platform, how do you transfer your</i><br>
<i>&gt; "consciousness" to that platform? How would you know the platform would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be you?</i><br>
<p>
I don't.  I have no faith in technology(in the religious sense)  This is<br>
why I prefer the nano-replacement method-- I can stop it if it isn't<br>
working.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; What about when I bang my head on the door, is that aging?  I would say </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; no, yet my neurons die, never to grow back.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't be provocative, you know what I mean. The great majority of</i><br>
<i>&gt; neuronal loss, in normal persons, is aging.</i><br>
<p>
I think you have entirely missed my point.  I will give you 3 points will<br>
together will give you much grief:<br>
<p>
1. Your brain is fragile- you will lose neurons whether you age or not.<br>
2. You have a finite number of neurons.<br>
3. Your neurons do not grow back.<br>
4. You (I assume) want to live for a long time.<br>
<p>
My recommendation to you: you might want to research more than just aging<br>
;) (unless you can live with a dwindling number of neurons)<br>
 <br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Hey, if you have "good ideas" to stop aging, I'll be very receptive to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Give a laboratory so that I can try them out.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, but I am just a student.  Go where the money is-- not here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As for the ideas, unfortunately my site is not working but there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; section called "Solutions and Problems" where I place "good ideas" to</i><br>
<i>&gt; stop aging as well as several problems attached to them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Even in birds, where the neurons do grow back, the information contained</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; within those neurons is lost forever. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What a flaw in my culture, I didn't know neurons in birds grew back. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; read that the axon of the neuron in some reptilians does grow back but</i><br>
<i>&gt; not the neuron itself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tell me more about this birds capacity, for example, what happens, does</i><br>
<i>&gt; the neuron itself grow back or is it just the axon? If it is the neuron,</i><br>
<i>&gt; how does it happen, are there any replicating neurological cells, I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; never heard of any but who knows? What about regeneration of whole</i><br>
<i>&gt; members such as a leg, it happens in reptilians, I don't remember</i><br>
<i>&gt; happening in birds, is this true? How do you explain it? Do you have</i><br>
<i>&gt; links for more information?</i><br>
<p>
I will research this for you.  In the meantime, the only source of<br>
information I can think of is a Discover Magazine from a few years back<br>
with an article called "Bird Brains."  Go to the periodical section of<br>
your local library.  Can anyone else help here?<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If you have no evidence or proofs, what is the source of this "belief" of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; yours.  Also, what purpose does this belief serve?  Are you afraid of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; being "undecided"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I guess it's a bit irrational (when you don't have any evidences and</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to draw conclusions, you use your balls right?)</i><br>
<p>
No, I don't.  I find my balls are very good at making logical<br>
deductions.  What do women do?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I lived with my</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain all my life and so far I had no problems. That's probably why I</i><br>
<i>&gt; feel so reluctant in changing my brain.</i><br>
<p>
Your brain is changing all the time.  Personally, I'd like more control<br>
over the way my brain is changing. Do you know anyone with Alzheimer's?<br>
There's a change I'd prefer not to have.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What makes you think the brain is the only platform for consciouness?  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sounds like a very religious and anthropocentric assumption.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's my only platform for intelligent (I don't like much the word</i><br>
<i>&gt; "consciousness"), I think there is intelligent life in the universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; besides ours, I think in the future we will built computers much more</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligent than us. For me, as an individual, my only platform is my</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain.</i><br>
<p>
You're going to let computers become more intelligent than you?  Haven't<br>
you seen Terminator 2 ?!?<br>
<p>
When computers are more intelligent than you, your only usefullness will<br>
be in a zoo or museum.<br>
<p>
I don't plan on being obsolete.<br>
