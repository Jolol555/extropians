<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is provided that it is not substantially hotter than its surroundings,</i><br>

<i>&gt; dropping, it will be heated by compression, but the medium around it is also</i><br>
<i>&gt; heated by compression, so as long as the bomb is cooler at the surface it</i><br>
<i>&gt; will stay cooler all the way down.  So it is important to deliver it to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; surface of the Sun in a way tha leaves it no hotter than the Sun itself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That means that it has to be placed rather gently on the surface of the Sun,</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than being dropped in at orbital velocity (200 km/sec).  Forrest</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bishop's message suggested doing this by halting an orbiting bomb in its</i><br>
<i>&gt; orbit using a gravitational slingshot manuver.  Unfortunately, this won't</i><br>
<i>&gt; work because such manuvers are limited in their delta-v to the escape</i><br>
<i>&gt; velocity for the bodies concerned, which for planet-size objects are only</i><br>
<i>&gt; tens of kilometers per second.  I was imagining using mass drivers on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; bomb to bring it suddenly to a halt by catching a bunch of mass going the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other way in the same orbit.  I'm not sure it's feasible; there's a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; waste heat.</i><br>

Okay, here's my idea:<br>
<p>
Take a large, but not too large, sheet of ice.  Attach a block of ice to one<br>
side of the sheet.  Frozen inside this block is the bomb.  Now, send this into<br>
the sun, with the bomb on the side facing away.<br>
<p>
The sheet of ice acts as a lightsail.  As the bomb gets close to the sun, the<br>
lightsail evaporates while slowing the fall.  Ideally, the lightsail should<br>
disappear at about the same time the bomb touches the "surface" of the sun.<br>
<p>
Some additional notes:<br>
<p>
If ice evaporates too fast, we can use a metal of some other melting point instead.<br>
<p>
If we put a fast-evaporating core of material, either into the light sail or<br>
the bomb box, then when the lightsail finally evaporates, the material will<br>
puff up, kick the bomb back for a final slowdown, and act as an insulating<br>
vapor cushion.<br>
<p>
All that ice helps keep the bomb cool.<br>
<p>
We can spin the whole circular lightsail to keep it from turning away.<br>
