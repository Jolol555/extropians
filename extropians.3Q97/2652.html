On the Foresight Exchange game, the claim TWAm is about whether flight 800<br>
was shot down by a missile.  The criterion is basically that the missile<br>
story becomes accepted enough as the true explanation that it is reported<br>
as fact by two major newspapers before Jan 1, 2000.  This does leave<br>
open the possibility that although the plane actually was shot down by<br>
a missile, there is a successful cover-up which lasts at least another<br>
2 1/2 years.<br>
<p>
Presently the claim is trading very low, only around 2 to 3.  This means<br>
that the traders basically see only a 2-3% chance that the missile story<br>
will turn out to be the accepted truth in the given time frame.<br>
<p>
There is also a claim TWAC which says that a bomb blew up the plane,<br>
and that is trading in the same very low range.<br>
<p>
At this point the traders on FX seem to strongly believe that neither<br>
a bomb nor a missile blew up the plane, or else that a coverup of these<br>
events will be successful.<br>
