I first heard about Jeremy Rifkin in an excerpt from his<br>
just-published book _Algeny_ in the May 1983 Datamation (a magazine<br>
for data processing management).  I thought it was so good I made a<br>
copy and highlighted the most potent passages. <br>
<p>
Rifkin talked eloquently of "moving from the age of pyrotechnology to<br>
the age of biotechnology"; and, "for our children, then, nature will<br>
no longer be something they are born into but rather something they<br>
program"; and, "a living organsim is no longer seen as a permanent<br>
form but rather as a network of activity. With this new definition of<br>
life, the philosophy of becoming supercedes the philosophy of being".<br>
<p>
A few years later, when Rifkin started making the news with his<br>
anti-biotech law suits, I was AMAZED to realize that he was against<br>
all these transhuman trends he had so aptly described!<br>
<p>
Here's the note I wrote on my copy of the article: One would hardly<br>
suspect, by reading these cleverly edited excerpts, that Jeremy Rifkin<br>
is vehemently opposed to 'algeny'. This leads me to conclude that<br>
Rifkin is simply a clever journalist out to exploit all angles of his<br>
chosen niche.<br>
