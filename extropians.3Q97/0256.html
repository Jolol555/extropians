<i>&gt; So why the hostility? I see no reason to believe Velikovsky's theory, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; while it's highly improbable, it's certainly possible. Unlike, say, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; perpetual motion folks, Velikovsky has claimed nothing that breaks any</i><br>
<i>&gt; known law of science. So why is it that mention of him causes such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; knee-jerk reaction from so many people? </i><br>

There are a large number of things that are highly improbable.  So<br>
improbable in fact that they can be assumed not to have occurred, unless<br>
there is extremely good evidence otherwise.  I would bet my life (and that<br>
is not a statement I make lightly or often) that there is no good evidence<br>
for Velikovsky's theory.  It would be about as probable for a fully formed<br>
bacteria to suddenly appear on replicator-less Earth because free floating<br>
lipids, amino acids, nucleotides, and sugars all just collected in the<br>
right place at the right time by random chance.<br>
