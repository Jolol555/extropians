The New Drug isn't prohibited, so no crack ghettos form.<br>

Yes.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What's the difference between David Pearce (who?) and a ghetto user?</i><br>
<p>

David Pearce is the author of "The Hedonistic Imperative" and - IMSOHO - a<br>
great and *experienced* cognitive engineer.  I hope that someday my<br>
"Algernon's Law" page grows into the neurosurgical equivalent of his great<br>
neuropharmacological masterpiece.  Hedweb is the first place to check for<br>
anything relating to the neurology of pleasure, motivation, and so on, which<br>
covers a great deal more territory than you might think.  As a master of<br>
pharmacology - his motto is "Better Living Through Chemistry" - he catalogues<br>
the neurological and subjective effects of modern-day drugs for brightening<br>
your life and even your mind.<br>
<p>
I think I'll probably beat him to market simply because neurosurgery is *so*<br>
much easier than neuropharmacology.  But a substantial amount of what I do is<br>
simply and directly derived from the invention of surgical equivalents to his<br>
chemical catalogue.<br>
<p>
IMSOHO stands for In My Sort Of Humble Opinion.<br>
<p>
Anyway, that's the reason why I wouldn't interfere with him if he decided that<br>
cocaine was a Good Thing in and of itself.  I'd probably check his data before<br>
I swallowed the stuff myself, but I'd never interfere with him.<br>
<p>
I'm not quite sure what his perspective would be on my proposal to eliminate<br>
cocaine.  As I and a few others pointed out, cocaine would pop up again sooner<br>
or later no matter what kind of virus I hit it with.  I don't know whether<br>
he'd like my viral warfare, although he would probably be disturbed by the<br>
shadow of Prohibition and criminalization that everyone is rightly nervous<br>
about.  I suppose he might feel that it was his duty to oppose me on such an<br>
issue.  Anyway, I get the impression that he looks on drug abuse the same way<br>
I might look on self-performed lobotomies.  Stupid, incompetent, and dangerous.<br>
<p>
I'd almost certainly call him in as a consultant in any case - for the<br>
withdrawal cases, to increase willpower, and maybe to make less dangerous<br>
alternatives to crack available.<br>
<p>
Anyway, from reading his list of Good Drugs for Family Usage, I get the<br>
impression that cocaine is a crudely targeted pharmaceutical with<br>
indiscriminate side effects, and that many well-targeted alternatives exist to<br>
replace it.  More expensive?  Probably, but as I pointed out in a different<br>
thread, we're running out of work, not capacity.<br>
