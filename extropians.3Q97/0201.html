        Why would they [animals] be any different?  I'm sure there are<br>
probably<br>
        some insects (worms?) that have no conscious experience or phenomenal<br>
        subjective experience at all, having purely abstract intelligence.<br>
 In<br>
        order to know what echo-location is like for a bat we simply must<br>
        reproduce the proper neural correlate (or whatever gives the bat it's<br>
        experience) in our conscious world.<br>

Personally, I believe that we will be suprised by the abundance of<br>
consciousness when we do finally 'discover' it.  It is a common belief that<br>
consciousness is a result of any complex network (thus, allowing for<br>
conscious machines).  If this is true why is there not one large<br>
consciousness, after all the universe is the largest network.  Maybe there is<br>
a collective consciousness, and our smaller consciousness exist within this.<br>
 This could also lead to an abundance of counscii making up our own<br>
consciousness, our minds could already be a collective of many independent<br>
conscious beings (each of which thinking it's the only consciousness).<br>
<p>
I'm going to be wildly speculative here:  Could it be that consciousness is a<br>
product of any logic (not just highly complex networks such as our brain).<br>
 Whenever cause and effect takes place there could be a spark of<br>
consciousness, possibly only lasting for a nanosecond and maybe inferior<br>
compared to our own.  Out of this web of conscious thought higher level<br>
conscii start to appear, eventually leading to our own complex perceptions<br>
and beyond.<br>
<p>
Of course, consciousness could simply be the product of some chemical, or<br>
brain pattern that we have evolved over the years.  Whatever it is, if it<br>
exists we'll find it, it's just a matter of time.<br>
