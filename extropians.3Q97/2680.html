<i>&gt;one hand, and nano self-replicator on the other. Mycoplasma </i><br>
<i>&gt;genitalium, automotive vehicles and comersial software are all </i><br>

<i>&gt;self-reproducing device would be much harder than simply to make </i><br>
<i>&gt;something useful that can replicate. </i><br>
<p>
We're talking about gray goo here, right?  That has to live in the wild,<br>
without getting all its little cogs and conveyor belts clogged up with<br>
natural molecules  that just happen to fit into its various nooks and<br>
crannies.  I don't see any way to solve that kind of problem without<br>
actually putiing it in the world and seeing what fails.  If you're talking<br>
about something that can only replicate in a sterile tank of ultrapure<br>
feedstock, I'd be willing to believe that it could be less 'optimised', but<br>
it is also far less potent economically and militarily.  <br>
Further, a certain minimum level of 'optimality' is needed for a<br>
self-reproducing device to function at all: if the mean time until failure<br>
is less than the mean time until reproduction, growth is impossible.  Thus,<br>
a self-replicator is analogous to an orbital rocket: there's no use for a<br>
launcher that only gets up to 90% of orbital velocity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;For example, a universal Turing </i><br>
<i>&gt;machine has been constructed in Conway's Life world. The entity is </i><br>
<i>&gt;very big and it was hard, but nothing near a thousands of genius-year </i><br>
<i>&gt;task, to do it. The feasibility stems from the fact that you have </i><br>
<i>&gt;identical components that you can put together into bigger identical </i><br>
<i>&gt;components, and so on, and at each step you need only consider the </i><br>
<i>&gt;apparatus at a certain level of abstraction. If this is the right </i><br>
<i>&gt;analogy for nanotech, then the design work would seem tractable, once </i><br>
<i>&gt;the right tools are there. But I will take your opinion on this </i><br>
<i>&gt;issue into account in my future thinking. And debugging is also a </i><br>
<i>&gt;complication.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that Conway's Life self-replicator design could be carried out to<br>
completion in a short time.  However, it is not a good analogy.  The Life<br>
world is perfect, so engineering reduces to mathematics.  Moreover, Conway<br>
designed his machine to function in an infinite vacuum, so the complexity<br>
produced by the impingement of the world is not present.  I doubt that a<br>
Life self-replicator could exist in a sea of random pixels, inasmuch as any<br>
design for Life machinery I have seen will be completely destroyed by a<br>
single erroneus pixel.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; (3) Drexler and Merkle are two very (very!) smart guys.  They have labored</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; for years, and designed what?  Some bearings, a transmission, a PLA, and a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Stewart platform?  And you claim this shows how easy it is?  I'd hate to see</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; an engineering task you considered hard! </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Those are again optimized designs. </i><br>
<p>
No they aren't.  Thay are pretty much the first designs they came up with<br>
that didn't explode in simulation.  And they totally ignore issues of<br>
manufacturability, optimization of peformance, radiation tolerance, failure<br>
rates (short of instantaneous explosion), and some other things I haven't<br>
thought of that will turn out to be totally critical once we try to build<br>
these machines.  All these things can be ignored for a proof-of-concept<br>
simulated prototype, which is what they needed to prove their point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What about the rod logic </i><br>
<i>&gt;computer? </i><br>
<p>
The only part of it designed to atomic precision was the PLA (programmable<br>
logic array) I mentioned above.  Even there, only the rods were designed to<br>
atomic precision, not the frame that holds them, so maybe I shouldn't count it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And I didn't Drexler give it as an exercise to his students </i><br>
<i>&gt;to design an autoreplicator when he taught a course at some </i><br>
<i>&gt;university? I am not sure about how detailed these designs are, </i><br>
<i>&gt;though. (Could anybody tell us this, please?)</i><br>
<p>
I wasn't in that course, but I've read Nanosystems closely, and the<br>
replicator design in there is at a fairly high level of abstraction.  It's<br>
detailed enough to convince me that nanotechnology is a feasible technology,<br>
which was its purpose.  It is by no means designed to atomic detail.<br>
<p>
More later.  Must sleep.<br>
