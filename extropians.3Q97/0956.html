McKenna is a visionary prophet and meta philosopher, not a scientist. I<br>
do love his way with words, much more entertaining than the usual B.S.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Besides, isn't savannahs (or coastal areas if you believe in the</i><br>

At the times in question the Sahara was a temperate climate, possibly<br>
much like the American Midwest. My major objection is that dung beetles<br>
rule Africa, and all piles likely to grow mushrooms will not remain<br>
intact long enough to do so. An elephant dump turns into a sheet about 2<br>
inches thick within 48 hours, and vanishes in about a week. Shroom<br>
mycelium incubation to fruiting takes 2 weeks minimum.<br>
