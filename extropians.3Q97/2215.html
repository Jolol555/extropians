Well, I finished the Jacobs book.  Short synthesis: she feels multicity<br>
nation-states as they exist today are doomed.  Empire size ones like the<br>
US will have their cities strangled due to lack of accurate feedback,   <br>
and trading nations will turn into oversized city-states.  "Transactions<br>
of decline" such as perpetual high levels of military spending, and<br>
continual transfer payments to undeveloped/stagnating/elderly parts of<br>
the country, drain the productivity of healthy cities.  European<br>
monetary union probably wasn't too visible in 1984; I'm sure she would<br>
have been appalled by the prospect.<br>
<p>
The main hope she sees is if nations could somehow become more flexible<br>
about splitting up, "trading the power of survival for the power of<br>
reproduction" since they won't be surviving anyway.  Obviously the US<br>
won't be splitting into city-states anytime soon, with or without<br>
surviving free trade/defense/environmental pacts.  But she raises the<br>
concept of "pattern states", nations which adopt a new structure and are<br>
then imitated.  E.g. Britain's parliamentary system, the US's structure,<br>
the Soviet Union.<br>
<p>
Possibly (this is me now) Canada or the UK could serve as patterns, and<br>
should be watched or encouraged if possible.  Quebec splitting off and<br>
developing, or Scotland or Wales doing the same, could be a profound<br>
example.  Of course growing a healthy city takes a fair amount of time.<br>
<p>
Jacobs seemed to make, without trying to, many good purely practical<br>
arguments for libertarianism at a national level.  (In a world of<br>
private currencies, if she's right each city would come to be dmiinated<br>
by one local currency, which would serve the purpose.)  In earlier books<br>
she outlined possible need for intelligent guidance at the city level.<br>
<p>
Absent "matter compilers", and possibly even with them, it seems to me<br>
that dense collections of people and specialized producers will continue<br>
to be necessary, if not more important, not to mention more fun for most<br>
humans.  City issues could be somewhat important for future<br>
civilization. <br>
<p>
(Etymologically an extreme understatement.)<br>

(Apologies for any lack of coherence; I'm tired, but want to throw more<br>
ideas out there.)<br>
<p>
A dream of a meme<br>
is a wonderful theme<br>
or so we always do deem;<br>
But a ream in a beam<br>
causes termites to teem<br>
or so it to me does seem.<br>
