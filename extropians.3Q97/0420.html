I don't mind joint ownership or joint contracting, as long as the state<br>
doesn't absolve the individual owners of responsibility and/or treat<br>
"them" as and abstract "person." I'm not a expert on corporate law, but<br>
I do know that a bunch of guys can get a charter from a state, slap INC.<br>
after their company's name and magically enjoy special protections that<br>
the same group who decided not to incorporate would.<br>
<p>
It's a short but difficult book and sometimes downright weird, but<br>
Buckminster Fuller's GRUNCH captures a bit of what I'm saying here. And<br>
does't David Friedman address the relationship of state-corporations in<br>
an anarcho-capitalist society in Machinery of Freedom (I can't remember,<br>
now)?<br>
