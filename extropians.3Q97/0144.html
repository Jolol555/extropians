The Civil War didn't free the Slaves...It just changed the ownership.<br>
<p>
According to Thomas Hume (I think) man's lot in a state of nature is vicious,<br>
brutal and short.<br>
<p>
Therefore to counteract that man gave up his individual liberty...traded<br>
freedom for security...and began the path toward a sufficiently high level of<br>
technology where once again individuals could "own themselves"<br>
<p>
If I were to own myself there are several things taken for granted in todays<br>
culture that would be unacceptable.<br>
<p>
Conscription comes to mind....Also the multitude of "Victimless"<br>
crimes...(Prostitution...Drug Use....Smoking...Pornography...Country Western<br>
Music....), Taxation...serving on Juries...any occurence whereby property is<br>
taken against a person's will or a person is forced to perform actions. (key<br>
words...&lt;forced&gt; &lt;taken&gt;)<br>
<p>
Since these things ARE allowed  it is obvious that the government (actually<br>
those in control of same) regard us as no more than slaves.  Slaves of<br>
benevolant masters perhaps...but slaves.<br>
<p>
I don't recall having heard of how a society of FREE individuals would<br>
function.  However we'd probably better figure it out....since if Vernor<br>
Vinge's prediction concerning the inevitable collapse of governments is<br>
true.........<br>
