SCENARIO: With increasing automation and corporate downsizing, good <br>
paying jobs will become less and less available.  Jobs will either be <br>
those of highly skilled/creative varieties or very low-skill.  Now I <br>
would assume most people on this list are either already very <br>
skilled/creative or our doing everything they can to get there.  <br>
Unfortunately the nanotechnological revolution has not occurred yet, so <br>
unless you have a job, your basic necessities of shelter &amp; food will be <br>
hard to come by.  The clever among us, will figure out how to survive <br>
off the land or gain access to using high-intensity hydroponic equipment <br>
before they are downsized out of a job...<br>
<p>
Do you feel this is a likely scenario? If so, I would like to hear how <br>
you would deal with this situation.   How would you survive?  And if <br>
your humanitarian enough, what would you propose to ensure the survival <br>
of the rest of humanity in the face of it?<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
<p>
Bobby Whalen  <br>

P.S. Now personally, I look forward to the day when all menial <br>
uncreative work is automated &lt;as long as I'm benefiting&gt; from this <br>
high-efficiency society.  It would be even better if everyone benefited.  <br>
Me, I would rather be scuba diving in the bahamas than working the grind <br>
every day!  <br>
