<i> &gt; about this... I'm just looking to hear what others have to say.)</i><br>
<p>
I've wondered about this a lot, too, especially in regard to<br>
Heinlein and Leary.  My only guess is that the "deep structure"<br>
of the memes that make up our culture contain a huge amount of<br>
stuff that is essentially adaptations to the formerly inevitable<br>
mortality of human beings.  This stuff is psychologically<br>
"deep" and therefore difficult to intentionally reprogram,<br>
because it is very very old, and therefore nearly universal to<br>
all human cultures.  European psychologists discussed it as the<br>
"death wish".  I think we can root it out of ourselves, but I<br>
also suspect that it has been planted deep in many of us before<br>
we learned enough about the world to want to yank it out, or to<br>
start to learn how to yank it out.  It's not as simple as<br>
wishing it to no longer be a part of yourself.  This is one of<br>
those complex areas where things like ceremonial magick might<br>
prove useful as a self-reprogramming technique.  Anders, have<br>
you cooked up any immortality affirmation rituals to chase away<br>
the old deathist demons?<br>
<p>
I'm also reminded of an anecdote that Freeman Dyson included in<br>
one of the essays in his book FROM EROS TO GAIA, recounting his<br>
being mugged in the lovely national capital of the US.  He<br>
reports having a deep feeling of calm as he lay in the bushes<br>
with his blood and injuries, staring up at the sky.  Given the<br>
subtlety of the selection pressures that produced "altruistic<br>
genes" it's possible that we even have genetic adaptations that<br>
allow us to "die well", and that warp our psychology in that<br>
direction.  It's a strange world that made us.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; 2)  Does anyone have any suggestions for what we can do to prevent</i><br>
<i> &gt; this? How many more of our luminaries will go gently, peacefully</i><br>
<i> &gt; into oblivion before we begin to stem the tide?</i><br>
<p>
Here we run smack into self-ownership issues that make me very<br>
edgy.  I suspect the best thing to do is to emphasize that we<br>
as individuals are physical beings, and not just our memes and<br>
our genes.  There are many internal motivational conflicts,<br>
between gene and gene, between meme and meme, and between memes<br>
and genes.  The very old stuff that prepares us for an easy<br>
death is well dug-in, and will win out by default if we don't<br>
develop an awareness of what is going on inside of us.<br>
<p>
Improved medicine will help too.  I'm not that old and already I<br>
can notice the deterioration of my body and, to some extent, of my<br>
mental skills, and it's quite depressing.  Depression is a large<br>
complex phenomenon that is still rather poorly understood.  Before<br>
a few centuries ago, the vast majority of our ancestors died before<br>
age thirty, so it should be no surprise that we are poorly adapated<br>
to getting old.  Fortunately we are developing the technological<br>
skills to start adapting ourselves.  Its tricky, but I think we<br>
can save ourselves.  I don't know about the people who have already<br>
made up their minds that they don't want to be saved, though.<br>
