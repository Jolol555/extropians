The problem is that laser beams can only maneuver non-super-cold atoms with<br>
a precision on the order of a wavelength of light, which is 2000 times<br>
larger than an interatomic spacing.  The hold provided by the laser beam is<br>
very 'soft'; it doesn't constrain the position of the atom sharply enough to<br>
permit precise assembly in the presence of thermal noise at any temperature<br>
above a millionth of a Kelvin.  And below a millionth of a Kelvin, every<br>
atomic bond you form will release enough energy to overheat a billion atoms.<br>
You'll have to wait for them to stop jiggling before you make another bond.<br>
I don't think it would be very efficient.  But somebody should try it.  It<br>
won't provide a cheap mass-production method, but it might suffice to make<br>
the first assembler.<br>
<p>
On these scales gravity is negligible; we won't need zero-g.<br>

Actually, the closer an object is in size to a wavelength of light, the<br>
easier it is to push around.  For bacteria that are close to one wavelength<br>
across, you can yank them around, hold them in place, etc, with a cheap<br>
desktop laser apparatus.  I don't think holding the work-in-progress will be<br>
hard, at least compared to holding the atoms you're adding to it.<br>
