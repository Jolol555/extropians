And why do you *have* to run Microsoft software on an Intel processor? I<br>
chose a computer with an Intel processor because it's cheap and runs my<br>
favorite games, and I only have a DOS partition in order to run Duke Nukem<br>
3D and Strike Commander (Doom and Quake are already ported to Linux). If<br>
the new freeware DOS clones are compatible enough I'll soon be able to<br>
eliminate all Microsoft software from my computer. <br>

Yes; so why use it? On a normal day my only contact with Microsoft<br>
software is the NT machine on my desk, which I only have because the<br>
company decided to standardise on some weird Windows email system for<br>
internal mail and Word for documents (and because I can happily trade<br>
resolution for colors and run it with a 16-bit display to check out my Web<br>
pages). I do all my real work, internet email and Web page development on<br>
Linux.<br>
<p>
Microsoft is *not* a monopoly. Last I heard their turnover was less than<br>
Apple and much less than IBM. NT was announced as the wonderful new<br>
operating system which would take over the world, yet it flopped despite<br>
Microsoft's marketing muscle; now every year they announce that NT will<br>
soon replace Unix, and every year it fails to do so because it just can't<br>
compete. Not even Microsoft marketing can beat reality. <br>
<p>
There are numerous operating systems you can run other than MS-Windows<br>
(e.g. Linux, FreeBSD, NeXTStep, OS/2) and many alternatives to Microsoft<br>
applications. Most of them are no only cheaper, but more powerful and more<br>
reliable. No individual or company *has* to run Microsoft software but<br>
many choose to do so, because Windows has real advantages; it has a large<br>
software base and for novices it's easier to use than most alternatives.<br>
If you don't like it, then don't use it. No coercion is involved. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you consider Windows 95 progress then you haven't really </i><br>
<i>&gt;fathomed the potential software that could really be done on these </i><br>
<i>&gt;supercomputer chips we now posses.</i><br>
<p>
Windows 95 *is* progress compared to Windows 3.1, and Windows NT is<br>
progress compared to Windows 95. As far as I'm concerned they're all dross<br>
compared to real operating systems like Linux, but they're definitely<br>
progress compared to the previous dross that Microsoft has sold.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Microsoft and Intel are in bed </i><br>

<p>
Of course they are. They make money, I get cheap computers; we all<br>
benefit. What's the problem? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's corporations that are increasingly requiring piss tests to get a </i><br>
<i>&gt;job. </i><br>
<p>
As far as I'm aware, most of those corporations are forced to do those<br>
tests by the government in order to retain their government contracts and<br>
wouldn't do so otherwise. The exceptions seem to be corporations hiring<br>
unskilled workers, who can't trust them not to turn up wasted; companies<br>
hiring skilled workers can't afford to upset them without a good reason. <br>
<p>
What stops you from working elsewhere, or as an independent contractor?<br>
I'm damned if I'm going to work for any corporation that expects me to<br>
piss in a bottle, regardless of their reasons, but I support their right<br>
to voluntarily impose the tests. Until the government mandates tests for<br>
all workers I can simply take my skills elsewhere.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Imagine if you had to take a random piss test from the government</i><br>
<i>&gt;just to stay in "good citizen" status and not be thrown in jail! </i><br>
<p>
Hey, don't joke... recently the British government have been musing about<br>
random roadside piss-tests for drivers just in case they've been taking<br>
anything. "But if it saves just one life..." <br>
