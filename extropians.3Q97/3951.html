         <br>
<p>
I, that is, the thoughts that matter produces when it is organized in a <br>
John Clark-ish way, doesn't value E.Coli, can see nothing unique about the <br>
ones in Clark's gut and doesn't care if they survive or not.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Obviously, your definition of a person is not useful for an outside        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;observer.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I disagree, if a chunk of matter acts in a John Clark-ish way then it is <br>
John Clark.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I don't know what your thoughts are. All I can observe is your        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;current structure, and your history of structure  and actions.</i><br>
                  <br>
True.<br>
                  <br>
<i>      &gt;Maybe these two projects are immmiscible, what do you think?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's possible that my copy does not have my consciousness but very unlikely, <br>
I would say it's comparable to me being the only conscious creature in the <br>
universe, not worth worrying about. Even if true it would be my problem not <br>
yours, from your point of view my copy is definitely John Clark.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Say I run a race, and I win, and the award ceremony is tomorrow.        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;[...] Who does the prize go to? Now is the distinction between        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;original and copy meaningless?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes meaningless. Your "copy" is identical to the "original" so both of you <br>
are equally convinced that you are the original, you are convinced that you <br>
are the original, but are you the original? As for who gets the prize, flip a <br>
coin, both have an equal claim to it, but of course then they would no longer <br>
be identical because one lost the toss and one did not.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;one would see that the duplicate has little or no history, while the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;original quite obviously does.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The history of the copy is very rich, not long ago the atoms in him were in <br>
plants and animals and inorganic chemicals, just like the original. The chain <br>
of reasons why the atoms in the copy are in the position they are now and <br>
have the velocity they have now goes all the way back to the Big Bang. <br>
I don't want to slight the original, he had a nice history too.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Maybe I just have a hard time seeing convergance in similarity as a        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;full convergance.  There are still too things, even if they are the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;same in structure.</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
Atoms have no individuality, if they can't even give themselves that property <br>
they certainly can't give it to us. If you make 2 objects and place the atoms <br>
as accurately as quantum mechanics allows then you don't have two objects you <br>
have 2 instances of one object, like 2 instances of one E-mail message. <br>
If my copy is not me then the soul must exist. I think the soul is hogwash.<br>
<p>
                     <br>
<i>        &gt;With this philosophy, I assume you judge a person by a clean-slate        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;policy? Do you think people are not responsible for past actions        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;because it doesn't matter how they got to be the way they are, it's        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;just the way they are now?</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
No, if I'm a serial killer then so is my copy.  <br>
I wish nothing had to suffer, ever, not even evil men, after all they suffer<br>
just as intently as a good man. Unfortunately that's not possible and evil <br>
men must be punished, but there are only 2 reason that I can find to justify <br>
that, to keep the person from committing more evil acts and as a deterrent <br>
for others. That is justice, more than that is vengeance.<br>

<i>        &gt;Okay, tell me your algorithm for storing all the information        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;describing a object in one bit, the world needs to know!</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't have such an algorithm. As I pointed out in another post, if the   <br>
Beckenstein bound is true then the amount of information inside a sphere  <br>
of radius R meters and mass M kilograms is less than or equal to <br>
2.577 *10^43* M*R bits. I don't think you'd need anything close to that sort <br>
of accuracy to make a chunk of matter behave in a John Clark-ish way.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Your physical state is destroyed and replaced for every quantum        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;uncertainty, and many times when drinking a cup of coffee.  But it        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;isn't physical state we're trying to preserve, it's consciousness.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
We don't need to guess about fantastically tiny and subtle physical effects <br>
changing conscious, we know with absolute certainty that coffee effects <br>
consciousness, and there is nothing tiny about it, if it were people wouldn't <br>
bother to drink it at all. Do you really worry about lousing your identity<br>
when you drink a cup?<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Since a quantum uncertainty can destroy and replace you, then it can        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;also change the input between two instances of the same object.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Use redundancy and a digital line and the error rate can be made arbitrarily <br>
low.              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Input goes beyond your senses, the entire arrangement of the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;universe and every particle in it contributes.</i><br>
                  <br>
ESP?              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The point is, consciousness does not exist as one point in time,        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;it exists across time.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's true, without senses consciousness can't detect space or time, I could <br>
stop your mind for a billion years and then restart it and you would never <br>
know.             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It is created by past experience</i><br>
                  <br>
Agreed.<br>
                  <br>
<i>        &gt;and fueled by future experience,</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't know what that means.<br>
<p>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;if there exists a lapse in logic between these, (being destroyed        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;at one point in time and recreated in another place/time, not to        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;mention another hardware system constitutes as a lapse in logic)        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;then the conscious thread is terminated.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
What lapse of logic? There are reasons your copy is the way he is and those <br>
reasons are every bit as good as the reasons you are the way you are, in fact <br>
most of the reasons are the same.<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me: </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Suppose I came to you and proved to you that Mr. YakWaxx died last         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;week, I used my Nano Robots to  take him apart atom by atom before         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;he knew what hit him, they carefully recorded the position of every         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;atom, then just 5 minutes ago my robots used this information to      </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;make a "copy" from different atoms that were  handy.        </i><br>
                  <br>
<i>        &gt;The "original" is me, it's this instance of me. Whoever went before         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;me doesn't matter and doesn't stop that fact that I want to carry on         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;this perticular instance of me.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Correct, and there is only one way to tell if you were successful in carrying <br>
on this particular instance of you, if the future YakWaxx looks at the <br>
present YakWaxx and says "I have his memories,  I have his personality,  <br>
no thoughts or emotions were interrupted, I remember being him, yep, that was  <br>
me",  then you have continued.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;is there any way you can know that my little story is not true? </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It's irrelevant.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I can't think of anything more relevant, if there is no way to tell if my <br>
little story is true then there is no reason to care if my little story is <br>
true.                                             <br>
