<p>
Do you think that this does not bring about an increase in liquidity?<br>
<p>
Let me ask.  How easy is it to buy and sell a few shares of Berkshire<br>
Hathaway?  Given that the share price is in the tens of thousands of<br>
dollars, I'd say that it's not so easy to find buyers or sellers.  Just<br>
as having your money in real estate makes it less liquid (less easy to<br>
convert to cash), so does having it in higher-priced stock.  <br>
<p>
I admit that there are two coupled forces at work here.<br>
<p>
1. a lower price allows "the little guy" to get into the stock, directly<br>
   driving up the price, and<br>
<p>
2. a lower price makes it easier to trade the stock.<br>
<p>
<p>
I also agree that stock splits tend to be a sign that the company is<br>
worth investing in, but I don't thing that this has much to do with the<br>
increase in price after a split.  I say this for two reasons:<br>
<p>
1. If the company is worth buying right after the split, it was worth<br>
   buying right before, and<br>
<p>
2. In my experience, the price of a split stock rises more *after* the<br>
   split, not between the announcement of the impending split and the<br>
   split date.  If the reason for the run-up was that the split itself<br>
   brought attention to the worth of the company, I contend that one<br>
   would see more of a run-up after the announcement and before the<br>
   actual split.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Finally, investors are more likely to buy shares at a low or mid-range</i><br>
<i>&gt;price than a very high price. To keep the share price going up steadily,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the board should split when it can. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, indeed.  Shares trade more readily when they are cheaper.  When<br>
things trade more readily, they are relatively more liquid, yes?<br>
