I upload.  The powers that be determine that uploaded individuals are no<br>
longer subject to nor responsible for the prevailing laws and cannot<br>
'know' of their origins.<br>
<p>
I 'program' a reality where I am 'god'.  If not given this ability upon<br>
'conception' I'd develop it.  It's in my nature (read 'program').<br>
<p>
Would I get bored?<br>
<p>
Probably.  But I would keep the program where nothing 'bad' happens to<br>
me.  For excitement I'd create 'individuals'  who would travel to other<br>
'realities' and report back.  I would try and 'break in' to those who<br>
tried to keep me out.  I'd befriend those I'd enjoyed and very possibly<br>
try and eliminate those I'd consider 'hostile'.  I would try and prevent<br>
the 'hostile realities' from knowing my original program.  I would<br>
befriend 'friendly' realities.  I would let my program run and try to<br>
influence it with my perceptions of 'good and evil' just to see what<br>
happens, changing it when it became too 'un-me'.<br>
<p>
Are 'we' in the same thing and just don't know it?<br>
<p>
Would this be 'nirvana'?  'Heaven' is anywhere where all occupants think<br>
the exact same way.  A very boring concept.  I'd want a diversity.<br>
<p>
Competition breeds advancement.<br>
<p>
I submit these fantasies because the technology is easier to obtain than<br>
the philosophy to deal with it.  This is neither to subvert the research<br>
in uploading nor to placate the fanatic.<br>
<p>
Perhaps it is the result of my upbringing, the concept of good and evil,<br>
Ying and yang, etc.  The results of progression should be examined<br>
before the technology brings the event to bare.  <br>
<p>
I also abhor the 'reality' that most of our 'laws' are brought forth<br>
from emotion rather than logic.<br>
<p>
Once we make 'uploading' a reality it is set in motion, as a law against<br>
loud music applies to hymns as well as to gansta rap music.<br>
<p>
We don't know what will happen.<br>
<p>
Titans created gods created mankind created ?<br>

single masterpiece."<br>
