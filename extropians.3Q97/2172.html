 I had the Olivetti active badge system in mind when I wrote that,<br>
the whole thing reminds me of a sort of "digital Quipu".<br>

 From the article:  "Civilization Without Writing -- The Inca and<br>
the Quipu"  by Marcia Ascher and Robert Ascher (also authors of<br>
"Code of the Quipu:  A  Study in Media, Mathematics and Culture",<br>
publisher and date unknown)<br>
 <br>
 "A quipu is a collection of cords with knots tied in them.   The<br>
cords were usually made of cotton, and they were often dyed one or<br>
more colors.  When  held in the hands, a quipu is unimpressive;<br>
surely, in our culture, it might  be mistaken for a tangled old<br>
mop.  (...)<br>
 <br>
     "Quipus probably predate the coming to power of the Incas. <br>
But under  the Incas, they became part of statecraft. (....)<br>
 <br>
      "There are several extremely important properties of<br>
quipus....  First  of all, quipus can be assigned horizontal<br>
direction. (...)  Quipumakers knew  which end was which; we will<br>
assume that they start at the looped ends and  proceed to the<br>
knotted ends.  Quipus can also be assigned vertical  direction. <br>
Pendant cords and top cords are vertically opposite to each<br>
 other with pendant cords considered to go downward and top cords<br>
upward.  (...)  Quipus have levels.  Cords attached to the main<br>
cord are on one  level; their subsidiaries form a second level. <br>
Subsidiaries to these  subsidiaries form a third level, and so on. <br>
Quipus are made of cords and  spaces between cords. (...)  Larger<br>
or smaller spaces between cords are an  intentional part of the<br>
overall construction. (...)<br>
 <br>
       "As well as having a particular placement, each cord has a<br>
color.  Color is fundamental to the symbolic system of the quipu.<br>
(...)  Basically,  the quipumaker designed each quipu using color<br>
coding to relate some cords  together and to distinguish them from<br>
other cords.  (...) Additional cord  colors were created by<br>
spinning the colored yarns together.  Two solid  colors twisted<br>
together gives a candy cane effect, two of these twisted<br>
together using the opposite twist direction gives a mottled effect,<br>
and the  two solid colors can be joined so that part of the cord is<br>
one color and the  rest of it is another color.  (...)<br>
 <br>
        "For the most part, cords had knots tied along them and the<br>
knots  represented numbers.  But we are certain that before knots<br>
were tied in the  cords, the entire blank quipu was prepared.  The<br>
overall planning and  construction of the quipu was done first,<br>
including the types of cord  connections, the relative placement of<br>
cords, the selection of cord colors,  and even individual<br>
decorative finishings.  (...)   The quipumaker's recording was<br>
nonlinear.  (...)  A group of strings occupy a space that has<br>
no definite orientation; as the quipumaker connected strongs to<br>
each other,  the space became defined by the points where the<br>
strings were attached.  (...)    Essentially then, the quipmaker<br>
had to have the ability to conceive  and execute a recording in<br>
three dimensions with color."<br>

-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 <br>
        Have you ever heard of the quipu of preColumbian Peru?<br>
 If you have, it's a minor miracle.   The  archives of<br>
 Incan quipu were burned by the Spanish conquerors, after<br>
 the Council of Lima in the year 1583.   There are about<br>
 400 authentic quipus left in the entire world.   Every<br>
 last one of the quipus we possess nowadays was dug out of<br>
 a human grave.<br>
 <br>
        Well, not quite every last one.  I happen to have a<br>
 brand-new quipu here in my pocket.  I was doing quite a<br>
 bit of reading about quipu, so I decided I'd make one.<br>
 <br>
        The word quipu means 'account' in the Quechua<br>
 language, so the quipu was basically a kind of accounting<br>
 device and calculator.   This is a fabric network to carry<br>
 data.  This was the only recording medium that the Incas<br>
 had.   It served all the recording functions of their<br>
 society.<br>
 <br>
        No one today seems to have any real idea how these<br>
 quipu worked.  They all looked more or less like this one<br>
 -- they had a thick fabric backbone, with a series of<br>
 dependent fringes.  But the fringes could also have<br>
 fringes.  Sometimes there were as many as six<br>
 subdirectories coming off the backbone of the network.<br>
 They had a variety of different knots.  They had quite a<br>
 wide variety of colors.  People have only the vaguest<br>
 ideas what the colors may have signified.<br>
 <br>
        This is a very small quipu.  The largest remaining<br>
 quipu weighs about forty pounds and has well over two<br>
 thousand dependent cords.  No one has any idea what this<br>
 device signifies or what message it carries.  It was<br>
 buried with a Peruvian gentleman who was modestly well to<br>
 do, but he doesn't appear to have been particularly<br>
 prominent.<br>
 <br>
        The Incas had no idea that the planet harbored any<br>
 civilization other than their own.   As far as they were<br>
 concerned, these quipu were the absolute apex of human<br>
 intellectual accomplishment.   And one must admit they<br>
 have a lot to offer.  They're very light -- wool and<br>
 cotton -- they're portable and durable.  Crush-proof.   No<br>
 problem with power surges or headcrashes.    A good thing<br>
 they were portable too, because one of their primary<br>
 functions was the census.<br>
 <br>
        It appears that everyone without exception in the Inca<br>
 realm existed as a knot in a quipu somewhere.   The Incas<br>
 were great masters of ethnic cleansing.  They thought<br>
 nothing of ordering thousands of people out of their homes<br>
 to distant realms as pioneers and settlers.  Everyone<br>
 simply loaded all their possessions onto their backs and<br>
 left immediately.  Thanks to the quipu, there was simply<br>
 no way they would ever be missed by the authorities.<br>
 <br>
        The Inca economic system was a centralized command<br>
 economy.   A third of the nation's economic output was<br>
 stored in vast ranks of stone cells.  Everything down to<br>
 the last sandal was recorded on quipu.<br>
 <br>
        I don't think there was ever an alphabet in quipu.  I<br>
 don't think that the Inca were literate in that fashion,<br>
 because their empire was only a hundred years old.  There<br>
 was nothing to pronounce that you could find on a piece of<br>
 string.  But there may have been geneologies in string --<br>
 hierarchies, maybe family trees.  Maps, even -- three<br>
 days' journey, they forded a blue river, they fought a red<br>
 battle -- you can imagine how usefully suggestive this<br>
 might have been.  Maybe you could attack language even<br>
 more directly with a quipu:   meter, stress, quantity,<br>
 pitch, length of the poem -- why should this be hard to<br>
 believe?   In English we sometimes call telling a story<br>
 "spinning a yarn."<br>
 <br>
         These Incas were fine textile makers.  They had a lot<br>
 of wool and cotton.  The government made them grow it, and<br>
 their women spun yarn every day of their lives.  When a<br>
 quipucamayoc read one of these recording devices, I don't<br>
 think his lips moved.   There was nothing crude or halting<br>
 or primitive or painful about the experience -- a quipu is<br>
 certainly a  more tactile and sensual and three-<br>
 dimensional experience than a book.<br>
 <br>
        The quipu was a medium.  It was a way to cast the<br>
 world into an entire new form of order.  It was a medium<br>
 invented by and for a very careful and methodical people,<br>
 people who liked to fit huge boulders together so snugly<br>
 that you couldn't slip a knife-blade between them.   For<br>
 the Incas, this was the Net -- a net that caught their<br>
 population in a sieve that dominated the whole material<br>
 world, a sieve that no one could escape.<br>
 <br>
        You know, in today's ultramediated world, I think it's<br>
 quite a good idea to go into a quiet room with a quipu.<br>
 Go to a room and shut off the electricity.  Don't look at<br>
 the quipu with scorn or condescension.    Just hold it in<br>
 your hands and try to pretend that this the only possible<br>
 abstract relationship, besides speech, that you have with<br>
 the world.   Really try to imagine what you are *missing*<br>
 by not comprehending all economics, all governmental<br>
 business, all nonverbal communication, as a network of<br>
 colored yarn.    Think of this as a discipline, as an act<br>
 of imaginative concentration, as a human engagement with a<br>
 profoundly alien media alternative.<br>
 <br>
        It's truly pitiful how little is known or remembered<br>
 about the quipu, a dead medium which was once the nervous<br>
 system of a major civilization.  And yet that is by no<br>
 means the only form of knot record.  There's the<br>
 Tlascaltec nepohualtzitzin, the Okinawan warazan, the<br>
 Bolivian chimpu. Samoan, Egyptian, Hawaiian, Tibetan,<br>
 Bengali, Formosan knot records.  So far, I know almost<br>
 nothing about these beyond their names.   I'd like to<br>
 learn more.  If I learn more and you're on my list, I'll<br>
 tell you about it.<br>
