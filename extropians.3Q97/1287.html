When I scolded that we should never underestimate the normative weight of<br>
the "real," I had more in mind than this truism -- tho' you're definitely<br>
in the ballpark.  My point -- and I think it is a stronger point -- is<br>
that there is a constellation of "magic" words whose function seems to be<br>
little more than to "block the road of inquiry."  These are the words<br>
"Right," "Good," "Beautiful," "True," and most of all, "Natural" -- and of<br>
course I mean these words in their perverse Philosophical as opposed to<br>
their everyday usages (hence the initial capitals).  All my life I've been<br>
accused of expressing unnatural desires -- from confident prepubescent<br>
assertions that I would live forever because I would scoop out my brain<br>
and plop it into a robot body -- to later assertions about an abiding love<br>
of a boyfriend -- to later still insistences on ethical vegetarianism.  My<br>
answer has always been the same: just how can anything that occurs in<br>
nature properly be called "unnatural"?  But the riposte never seems to<br>
stick, because these magic words aren't *about* referential adequacy.<br>
They attach to descriptions of the world precisely to make the<br>
descriptions immune from criticism.  John Stuart Mill's question goes<br>
right to the heart of the matter: "[W]as there ever any domination which<br>
did not appear natural to those who possessed it?"  The observation is<br>
from his _Subjection of Women_, 1869.  Best, Dale<br>
