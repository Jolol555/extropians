The only plausible theory that I have come up with, is that the NSPIC<br>
posts are being run through a rule-based grammar translater that is<br>
generating obtuse sentence structures.  It reminds me of a program that<br>
will take massive quantities of writing and generate random sentences by<br>
looking for phrases and stringing them together.  By hooking together<br>
phrases that overlap by one word, it simulates a continuity of verbage,<br>
but the complete sentences don't convey any real meaning.<br>
<p>
(Also, I was starting to worry that it was just me!)<br>
