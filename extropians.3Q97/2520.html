In response to John K Clark's comments:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;many of the immigrants are "illegal", but the government lacks</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;willpower and the popular support to take some firm action.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Government also lacks the ability, incompetence is not always a bad</i><br>
thing.<br>
No, but in this case it *is*. <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Free immigration could only function in a world with a fairly </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;(culturally, economically etc.) homogenous population.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nonsense. There are lots of menial tasks that need to be done around my</i><br>
house,<br>
<i>&gt; they need no special skills and I would be happy to pay somebody a dollar</i><br>
an<br>
<i>&gt; hour to perform them, but not more, I won't pay minimum wage because to</i><br>
me<br>
<i>&gt; it's only worth a dollar an hour. There are millions if not billions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; people in the world who would consider a dollar an hour wealth beyond the</i><br>
<i>&gt; dreams of avarice. Both of us would be better off if we could get</i><br>
together,<br>
<i>&gt; but one thing prevents us, government.</i><br>
<p>
It's been tried before, for example in South Africa and Israel...needless<br>
to<br>
say it didn't (doesn't) work very well. It basically means slum cities at<br>
the edge of "rich areas", or at least ghettos. Intercontinental travel will<br>
probably remain relatively slow and cumbersome for a long time to come,<br>
and way beyond the financial capabilities of your "dollar an hour" people.<br>
In other words: if you want cheap workers, they'll have to live relatively<br>
nearby. Since most of the good spots are already taken by the more<br>
fortunate folk, this means heavy concentration in shitty areas, which <br>
traditionally are a source of crime and unrest. Before you know it you'll<br>
have apartheid and the like.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As for cultural differences preventing free immigration, if I found a</i><br>
culture<br>
<i>&gt; to be unpleasant then I wouldn't want to go to that land, if I didn't</i><br>
then I<br>
<i>&gt; would.  What's the problem?</i><br>
The problem is others (less "fortunate" than yourself) coming to *you*. If<br>
immigration really was totally free, all successful places would be overrun<br>
even faster by masses of poor immigrants (in your case wave upon wave<br>
of Mexicans, I guess). In the ever more automated modern society there<br>
[is] will simply not be enough work for all these people, so you'll get<br>
extreme poverty (with all it's side-effects) on your doorstep (there is no<br>
social security system to help the poor, so we *are* talking *real* poverty<br>
here, and [thus] a lot of very desperate people. How long will they look<br>
at your (relative) wealth before they "touch"?) The cultural differences<br>
will only wider the chasm initiated by poverty, and will make it mentally<br>
easier for both parties to "dehumanize" the other (human nature, dude),<br>
and it's a lot "easier" to kill/rob/rape etc. an "alien" opponent.<br>
Like I've mentioned earlier, this is the road to a SA-(little pun here)<br>
style police state.                   <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;It may very well be breaking down (slowly), but what will</i><br>
replace it?<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The free market.</i><br>
<i>&gt;               </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;You seem to forget that most people aren't "rational libertarian</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;entities" </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have not forgotten, the market can not guarantee a libertarian society,</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing can, but it can encourage it. Suppose government did not force</i><br>
you to <br>
<i>&gt; buy law and police protection from them, suppose there was competition</i><br>
and you<br>
<i>&gt; could purchase the laws you liked from companies that were willing to</i><br>
enforce<br>
<i>&gt; them. It's easy to vote for some idiot politician who says he will stop</i><br>
your<br>
<i>&gt; neighbor from sinning, it's much harder to shell out cold hard cash for</i><br>
it.<br>
<i>&gt; For example, in this democracy many towns have laws against women wearing</i><br>
<i>&gt; string bikinis on the beach, and it's simple to see why, there are plenty</i><br>
of <br>
<i>&gt; prudes and it doesn't cost them anything to vote. Now let's consider this</i><br>
if<br>
<i>&gt; justice was sold as a commodity. The prude is considering 2 protection</i><br>
<i>&gt; companies that are identical except one has a law against bikinis and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; decency patrol to harass women on the beach 20 miles from his home, the</i><br>
other<br>
<i>&gt; doesn't but uses the money saved to send an extra security patrol through</i><br>
his<br>
<i>&gt; neighborhood at 3Am. The prude would have to be very prudish indeed to</i><br>
pick<br>
<i>&gt; the first Private Protection Agency.  Justice is no different than</i><br>
anything<br>
<i>&gt; else, if you want to maximize it sell it in a free market.</i><br>
The "private protection agencies" will probably evolve into *states*, with<br>
their own "turf" (country), "protection money" (taxes) etc. The correlation<br>
between what you pay and what you get will eventually fade, and you might<br>
end up with a truly medieval "city state" scenario, with bands of thugs <br>
roaming the countryside, despotic rulers, lots of small wars...the works.<br>
Hardly an improvement, I'd say.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;"We" are the Caucasians (oh, it's that ugly word again)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No not ugly, just rather quaint and old-fashioned, a phrase past its</i><br>
<i>&gt; expiration date, like "moving pictures" or  "horse-less carriage" or  </i><br>
<i>&gt; "phlogiston" or "luminiferous ether". </i><br>
Any ideas for a replacement?              <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Try promoting the extropian principles in the Middle East or</i><br>
Africa<br>
<i>&gt;         &gt; etc, and see how far you'll get...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; About as far as you would in the bible belt of the USA.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
The bible belt is just that: a retarded area in an otherwise apparently<br>
more sensible region (country). You have no bible belts in Islamitic<br>
countries because in fact the whole country is the belt. The fact that<br>
we (the Dutch have a bible belt too) have separate names for highly<br>
religious regions is a good sign; it means they're something abnormal. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;it's "bye, bye singularity" when the Muslims take over.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Your xenophobia is starting to sound a little silly.</i><br>
You can do better than using these cheap semantic tricks to discredit the<br>
"opponent". I presume you're not very familiar with the local (Dutch)<br>
politico-social situation, but that apparently doesn't prevent you from<br>
dismissing my worries as "xenophobia". You must be wise indeed.<br>
