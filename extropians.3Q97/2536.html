I agree with your agreement with Hal, that we have problem agreeing <br>
on scenarios. As I have explained earlier, I don't think that the <br>
problem of accidental goo is very interesting, for we can design away <br>
the possibility of mutation. I am therefore focusing on deliberately <br>
designed destruction-goo; in the simplest case we can assume a <br>
religious fanatic that wants to destroy the world. The basic issue <br>
has been whether a private (non-global) immune system can deal with <br>
this threat.<br>

<i>&gt; I don't think they can spread that fast.</i><br>
<p>
A low tech scenario, which would not allocate any sophisticated <br>
mobiliy to the nanites themselves, would be that somebody sprays them <br>
over a forest from a small aeroplane during the night. Most people <br>
would not want to do that, of course, but it suffices that there is <br>
one such individual in the world and then we are all dead.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; And if you accept immune systems</i><br>
<i>&gt; fighting nanites then you can't assume the organism is in a sea of goo,</i><br>
<i>&gt; because to make that sea the nanites would have had to eat lots of other</i><br>
<i>&gt; organisms with immune systems.</i><br>
<p>
No, they could eat dead organic material, or inorganic material.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Personally I'm still suspicious of this conception of nanites.  Little</i><br>
<i>&gt; atomic manipulators made of a single type of material</i><br>
<p>
No, nanotechnology makes use of many types of materials.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; trying to be more</i><br>
<i>&gt; capable than whole slews of complex enzymes, often dependent on</i><br>
<i>&gt; different transition metals, crawling around in a vast variety of</i><br>
<i>&gt; environments, and being able to take over the world in their first</i><br>
<i>&gt; generation.</i><br>
<p>
No, not in their first generation. Even when nanotech itself is <br>
mature, the "little atomic manipulators" have to multiply themselves <br>
many times over before they reach macrosopic quantities.<br>
