<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;I've always been curious why IQ scores don't appear on resumes. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;In 'The Bell Curve' is an appendix which claims to explain the tortured</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;history of using tests (including IQ) as a method of employee selection.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;would appear that all tests on which blacks score lower than whites on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;average have been banned, as being discriminatory.  This doesn't explain why</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;IQ scores do not appear on resumes outside the US, however.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The claim is that I would be arrested for placing my IQ score on my resume?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Similarly for putting "Mensa" under org memberships?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; I find such claims hard to believe.</i><br>
<p>
No, the claim is you could be sued for ASKING certain kinds of<br>
information of an applicant.<br>
<p>
This I find very easy to believe. For example, simply asking an<br>
employee or potential employee how old they are is liable to get you<br>
into serious trouble these days. Stupid? Yes. True? Also yes.<br>
<p>
Now, why don't certain things like IQ appear on resumes? One claim<br>
might be because a) most applicants don't know, and b) you'll never be<br>
able to get employees to bother to find out if no one can ask the<br>
information.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure I believe that, though.<br>
<p>
I'd say that a more rational explanation is that for any job that<br>
actually requires intelligence, three minutes of phone interview do<br>
far better than an IQ number can do for you. IQ is just too crude. I<br>
suspect other far better screening tests could be derived (I have a<br>
set of stock questions I ask interviewees with objective answers) but<br>
at the moment there isn't one, at least not one that I could use in<br>
*my* hiring decisions.<br>
