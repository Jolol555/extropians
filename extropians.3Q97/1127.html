And the little ecology of parasitical businesses. I had a fire in my<br>
garage. The insurance people are only going to pay 85% of the repair<br>
costs, if I use their contractor. I went to the planning office. Now I<br>
have a 5 page form with a checklist of 50 things REQUIRED just to submit<br>
a plan! The paperwork is harder than the job itself! I will have to hire<br>
an expert to deal with these 50 items or this will never get done.<br>
Sample item: "all floor, wall, ceiling &amp; roof framing with size and<br>
spacing of members (show compliance with table 25-Q (UBC) Nailing<br>
Schedule)". So, another $600 just to create the plan, $700 to file it,<br>
no guarantee of approval.<br>
<p>
With 30 days for approval at best, 3 weeks to get documents ready, I may<br>
have to wait through the winter to fix the goddamn roof.<br>
<p>
Conclusion: Building codes are not Extropian.<br>
