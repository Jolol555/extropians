<p>
&lt;&lt; Real scientists<br>
 don't waste the paper complaining, they try to show so good evidence<br>
 and proof that the establishment will be forced to accept them &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
A good point.  Complicated by the premise that the "researcher" is supposedly<br>
attempting to attract funds for research and development for his new<br>
technology and feels he is being shut out by "vested interests".<br>
<p>
It's hard for me to sort out.  When I was but a young lad...out on the dusty<br>
plains of West Texas...I KNEW...I was absolutely convinced...that Rockets,<br>
Computers,Ray Guns, etc. etc. were in the near future.  Now...many years<br>
later...all my expectations have been realized (in a manner of<br>
speaking)...Yet at the time all of my aquaintances and elders were skeptical<br>
in the extreme (Bible Belt Mentality)...<br>
<p>
They were wrong then....are they wrong now?<br>
<p>
As an aside.  Please evaluate Dr. Eugene Mallow's "Cold Fusion" crowd...as<br>
I've mentioned...I've surfed their websites...read some of their<br>
magazines...and they appear no more difficult to beleive than Penrose, Von<br>
Neuman, Hawkings or Al Gore.<br>
