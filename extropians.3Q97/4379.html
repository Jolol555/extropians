"Big Brothers intellectual gladiators?"  Who is this aimed at?<br>
<p>
"debate?"  A debate isn't a debate until people start debating.  If you want<br>
to plan a debate it's usually a good idea to *ask* those who are apparently<br>
joining the debate if they would like a debate.  If you're being spontaneous<br>
about the debate, then you shouldn't be planning the debate in the first<br>
place.  Just write your ideas clearly, remembering that many of us have<br>
little time to spare, drop it in the meme pool and see what happens.<br>
