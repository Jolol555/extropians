OK, politeness seems to have run its course.<br>
<p>
To DdO, Guardian of Humanity:<br>
<p>
*PLONK*<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Tell me, what crime is worse: kidnapping or murder? (rhetorical question!)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
It's rhetorical if you're a simpleton or a kindergarten student.<br>
I'm *so* glad they're providing Net access for you. Do your Mommy <br>
and Daddy help with the big words?<br>
<p>
You neglect to add the requisite ivory tower ideological crap: <br>
"all other things being equal". The more complete answer is:<br>
Depends on the circumstances. <br>
<p>
Turn it around: which right is more important, life or liberty?  <br>
To whom, when and why? If your answer is "life", unconditionally,<br>
the fact that you can't see both sides of the coin itself indicates<br>
a lack of at least one species of compassion--believe it or not.<br>
<p>
Turn it around another way: how much would someone have to *pay* you <br>
to guarantee you'd not interfere with that person's choice to die? <br>
If you can come up with a number, you have established what you think <br>
that person's liberty is worth. Is this the same amount of money you'd be<br>
willing to contract to pay me if I chose to die and you brought me back <br>
anyway? If not, why not? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Murder of course, because it's [effect is] irreversible. For this very</i><br>
<i>&gt;reason, many oppose the death penalty; what if you **make a wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt;judgement**? You can never undo the damage...the person is gone forever. </i><br>
<p>
I oppose the death penalty, administered by third (uninvolved) parties <br>
after the fact, for precisely this reason. I am more openminded about <br>
self-defense which results in the initiator of force winding up in a <br>
body bag.<br>
<p>
How's that for ivory tower ideological crap?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So, in the case of the reluctant suspension victim, the choice is easy</i><br>
<i>&gt;(unless</i><br>
<i>&gt;you're full of ivory tower ideological crap, of course :(#(</i><br>
<p>
Your words make it clear that in this matter, you do not believe <br>
that reasonable minds may differ. Very well. <br>
<p>
Grow up, and maybe we can actually have a conversation. 'Til then.... *PLONK*<br>
