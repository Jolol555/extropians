I've informed my daughters (aged 14, 12, and 7) that, since the<br>
Singularity<br>
will occur within 9 years, there is no reason for me to save for thier<br>
college educations, and that I'll spend all the money on computers.<br>
<p>
The 7-year-old thinks that's cool, but the 14-year-old is not happy.<br>
The 12-year-old only has a two-week planning horizon.<br>
Perfectly reasonable, since the 7-year-old won't be in college in<br>
9 years. Fortunately, they know I'm kidding.<br>
<p>
I'm teaching myself Java. This is consistent with my belief that<br>
better tools lead to higher programmer productivity, and my belief<br>
that software development productivity is the current main<br>
constraint on human progress.<br>
