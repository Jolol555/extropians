There's also no right NOT to have sex, (or at least not to have the desire<br>
for sex), not to fear, not to love, not to rage. Emotions  partly control<br>
our daily life, our decisions, who we are, what we are, severely limiting<br>
ones choice in these matters. Emotions are ruled by hormones/chemicals, yet<br>
the few emotion 'enhancers' or 'blockers' available are crude (side<br>
effects), and hard to obtain (medical prescription, illegal drugs, etc). I<br>
can practically run into the supermarket for a sexual enhancer, but it will<br>
be a long time before we can say the same for a cure for love, or other<br>
emotion blockers. Maybe our lives are one long continous addiction to<br>
chemicals. <br>

True, in nature sexual intercourse has various social functions other than<br>
just reproduction. (not all of them less 'sophisticated' than our own) The<br>
point about having sex, and making sure there is no reproduction, is a<br>
point of choice. The choice of the individual to block out natural<br>
processes, and the realization that some may not be beneficial to that<br>
individuals life. <br>
<p>
As said before, a 'right' to have sex isn't limited by other individuals,<br>
but it could be severly limited by ones other emotions. Some people can<br>
only have sex with someone they love,  others can only love someone they<br>
have sex with, while some just can't step over their fears. (and then there<br>
are those who can have sex with everyone, except they person they love ;) )<br>
<p>
When will they make that emotional switching board brain implant, and make<br>
the choices our own ?<br>
