Very Cool!  What companies were they?  I worked with someone who was<br>
suggesting that our company pick up a similar model, but we didn't in the<br>
end.  I suspect one of the biggest problems is trying to interface such a<br>
system with a traditional hierarchy.  I kinda wish we had tried it out; it<br>
sure couldn't have made anything worse!<br>
<p>
And how was the type of work and market value determined?<br>
