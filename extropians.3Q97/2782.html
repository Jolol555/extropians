Agreed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2. An immune system wouldn't work unless it was global.</i><br>
<p>
Let's say that no large areas of the earth should be left unsupervised an<br>
immune system.  No need to assume that only one immune system exists; I can<br>
easily imagine multiple, overlapping ones.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3. In the absence of a global immune system, if everybody could make</i><br>

<i>&gt;extinct.</i><br>
<p>
All human life, anyway.  Subterranean bacteria may hang on, if only because<br>
nobody bothers to try to exterminate them.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;4. In the absence of ethical motives, the benefits would outweigh the</i><br>
<i>&gt;costs for a nanotech power that chose to eliminate the competition or</i><br>
<i>&gt;prevent it from arising, provided it had the ability to do so.</i><br>
<p>
I utterly disagree.  I've had an ear infection for the last few days, so I<br>
haven't been posting with my usual vigor, but my silence does not indicate<br>
that I have come to agree with you on this point!<br>
