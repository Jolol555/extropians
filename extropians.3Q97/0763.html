        Few things make me mad; I often get frustrated, but there is truly<br>
very little that maddens me...one of the things that *does* make me mad<br>
--even on a mailing list-- is insolence.<br>
<p>
        It is in my opinion that one should always respect another and hold<br>
him or her in high regard until he\she breaches that respect.  I also think<br>
that one should respect another's beliefs or views to some extent...not<br>
barring questioning the fundamental core values of that person's beliefs.<br>
However, one thing that I always hope to see in every person I meet is the<br>
acknowledgement of reason --*why* they do the things they do and believe<br>
what they believe.  When I come across a person who *can't* or *doesn't*<br>
acknowledge the reasons for their beliefs or actions, I cannot accurately<br>
communicate with that person...it is almost futile for me to even try.  [As<br>
many may have noticed, I'm skirting around the point to ensure that this<br>
"rant" is not ad hominem.]<br>
<p>
        Extropy is probably the broadest lifestyle that the words "belief<br>
system" or "philosophy" can apply to.  This is because of the few mandatory<br>
memes that make up the philosophy...these memes are so taken for granted<br>
that they are almost taboo --particularly to those who have been familiar<br>
with the philosophy for a considerable amount of time.  One of these few<br>
mandatory memes is reason.  All extropians --or those who welcome extropy--<br>
acknowledge their reasons for doing what they do and believing what they<br>
believe: reason is essential to optimistic realism (as opposed to wishful<br>
thinking).  With reason, all extropians --or those who welcome extropy--<br>
look towards the future...times when they can kineticize human potential in<br>
a progressive manner.<br>
<p>
        When posts are made that insult the above memes (I can't think of a<br>
better word), it insults each individual extropian...it is insulting each<br>
extropian's way of life.  When claims are made that one is more extropian<br>
than another, it breaches that respect which is ever so important.  When a<br>
person does not possess the few mandatory memes mentioned above yet claims<br>
to be an extropian, that is a disgrace to the lifestyle.  When one worships<br>
mystical beliefs that are not provable and have no reason, then that person<br>
should not call themselves extropian.  <br>
<p>
        By ranting like this, I am extrapolating upon the way *I* live and<br>
my perspectives.  I hope that I have not offended anyone by involuntarily<br>
trespassing on the grounds of *their* perspectives.  If I have stepped on<br>
any toes, please tell me so...it won't hurt me.  <br>
