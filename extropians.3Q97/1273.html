        In the same effect, however, any person in any country could<br>
properly be regarded as "under attack," although I agree that certain<br>
groups such as homosexuals are more frequently blacklisted than others. <br>

<i>&gt;is remotely the most interesting thing about me, but neither do I think I</i><br>
<i>&gt;manage to be particularly unobtrusive about it.</i><br>
<p>
        Perhaps "unobtrusive" wasn't the best word I could use.  What I<br>
meant to say was to not be obtrusive about the fact that one is gay.  Not<br>
to make a big deal out of the fact.  Just as another person will treat his<br>
heterosexuality as "normal," so too should a homosexual treat his<br>
homosexuality as "normal."  I hold tight to my views that whether John is<br>
sleeping with Michael, Sheila or both, it should have little effect on<br>
John's ability as a worker.<br>
