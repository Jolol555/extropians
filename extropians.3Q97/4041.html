Whoa! Now I'm really puzzled. How can he simultaneously believe in the<br>
literal truth of the BIble and believe in evolution? The Genesis story is<br>
incompatible with evolution. I suppose he can accept a universe billions of<br>
years old, but he MUST also believe the earth was created in six days (and<br>
that God, pooped out after that effort took a day off to recuperate)<br>
because it clearly says that in the Bible.<br>
