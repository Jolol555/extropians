<i>&gt;From several meters below sea-level:</i><br>
<p>
Yesterday I had the pleasure to meet IRL the other Dutch members of this<br>
list to socialize, exchange ideas and make plans. Dalibor den Otter has<br>
taken the initiative to start a Transhuman Society here in Holland and all<br>
of us are going to help.<br>
It was great to talk to people that share so many of your own ideas &amp;<br>
beliefs. While trying to make a list of objectives for the society we kept<br>
getting side-tracked by spontanious discussions about nano-tech,<br>
cryogenics, computer technology and such. We were all a bit frustrated by<br>
the slowness of verbal communication (would have preferred a fiberoptic<br>
cable hard-wired to our frontal-lobes). We did not get as much work done as<br>
we would have liked to but the athmosphere was electric!<br>
<p>
Our primary goals will be to:<br>
- Create a legal &amp; organisational structure for the society<br>
- Build a bi-lingual website (Dutch/English) to promote transhuman <br>
  memes in Holland and Belgium (were the language is also Dutch - sort of).<br>
<p>
Hopefully this will allow us to formally initiate a society with at least<br>
25 active members or so within the next 3-6 months.<br>
<p>
After that we will divide in project-teams to work on concrete tasks:<br>
<p>
- Further promation of Transhuman ideas by extending the web-site, <br>
  promoting it, seeking alliances with memetically related <br>
  organisations/people, and usage of more convetional media to create <br>
  a greater awereness of our existence.<br>
<p>
- Promoting nanotechnology by educating key-persons in industry, <br>
  governement and influencial non-profit organisations like the dutch <br>
  cancer foundation (respected and well-funded).<br>
<p>
- Setting up a suspension-infratructure. This is not just a physical site<br>
  in Holland but also means emergency planning, educating doctors and<br>
  hospital staff, creating generall awerness by educating the public. <br>
  We believe that once a certain foundation has been laid down cryonics<br>
  could be pretty big in Holland since it is a very liberal country in<br>
  matters like these.<br>
<p>
- Collecting an organizing information on all kind of emering technologies<br>
  such as practical space exploration and genetic engineering and it's<br>
  possible applications and socioeconomical effects.<br>
<p>
- Organizing regular get-togethers (because Holland is so small we could do<br>
  this very often at little cost to anyone)<br>
<p>
There's just five of us now, we're just starting and have an enormous<br>
amount of work ahead of us. I'll be sure to re-read Max More's DO.htm file<br>
every now and then to further sharpen my 'can do!' attitude ;-)<br>
<p>
Any tips, contructive critisims, practical experiences and suitcases filled<br>
with unmarked 1000-dollar bill's will be greatly appreaciated.<br>
<p>
Send them to mountain@knoware.nl (we'll make an appointment for those<br>
suitcases)<br>
many thanks in advance.<br>
