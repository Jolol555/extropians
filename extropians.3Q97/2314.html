	ooh... to me that is a bit like saying "spare the rod, spoil the<br>
	child" or that hardship breeds character or other such nonsense.<br>
	in an extrme way i'm sure that living through the holocaust, for<br>
	instance, helped produce the fine person that many of the <br>
	survivors had become ... however, there are certainly more <br>
	pleasent ways to do this sort of thing.<br>
<p>
	in my own personal experience, lots of friends of mine have either<br>
	been home schooled in some way or had non-traditional educations.<br>
	a good example is one of my best friends that for various reasons<br>
	ceased going to school in the 9th grade.  his parents allowed him<br>
	to follow his interests (and they had the ability, financially,<br>
	to do so).  he now has a successful music career, does freelance<br>
	graphic design, and is a well adjusted 19 year old.  and he has<br>
	no problems interacting with other human beings.  this is because<br>
	he was able to pursue his interests at his own speed and interact<br>
	with adults as a human.<br>
<p>
	on the other hand, i was forced to interact with adults as a <br>
	2nd class human being (student)... the only things I could pick<br>
	up in public school were fighting, homophobia, xenophobia, being<br>
	a yes man and the other survival skills neccessary to a bipedal<br>
	hominid in the USA.  (i'm proud to say i've pretty well gotten<br>
	over all of that.)<br>
<p>
	i guess an "extropian viewpoint" on child rearing would be:<br>
	children are influenced, molded by their surroundings. why<br>
	would you subject your children to any system (public school, <br>
	catholic school, hebrew school, the rotary club, the marine <br>
	corps) that is anathema to Extropy?<br>
