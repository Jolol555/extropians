	I have a semantics problem with this paragraph.  I understand<br>
referring to the Constitution of the United States as the so-called<br>
Constitution, as a constitution is a document that governs the legal<br>
workings of an organization, and many people think that the legal system often<br>
subverts and ignores the provisions of the constitution in pursuit of<br>
their political projects.  However, an amendment is simply something in a<br>
document that was put in later through a process described in the original<br>
document.  The 14th amendment was not in the Constitution as originally<br>
written and was added later.  It is generally called the 14th<br>
Amendment, but that is because it is in fact the 14th Amendment, and not<br>
because of some disinformation program.  <br>
