The term "prejudices"  has negative connotations. It sounds better,<br>
and is easier to defend, by saying "Occam's razor" or by noting that<br>
"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof."<br>
<p>
Occam's razor is attributed to the medeval philosopher William of<br>
Occam (as I recall.) He said (roughly) "do not multiply hypotheses<br>
unnecessarily." When there is more than one explanation for a<br>
phenomenon that fits the facts and that is not contradicted, then<br>
pick the one that requires the fewest (or simplest) new hypotheses.<br>
<p>
So: given a fact: "there are currently no Unicorns" then either<br>
   1) there were never any Unicorns.<br>
   2) There were Unicorns, but the pixies scared them all away.<br>
<p>
We pick (1) instead ot (2), because if (2) then we now need to<br>
worry about the pixies.<br>
<p>
"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof" is an<br>
similar  principle. If a claim is really weird, then<br>
it's a lot more likely to be in error. Therefore, the onus<br>
is on the claimant to be convincing, and not on the rest of<br>
society to refute the claim. This is a practical matter:<br>
if we waset our time on low-probability investigations, we<br>
won't be spending time on more worthwhile endeavors.<br>
Note that I'm now talking about science, not law.<br>
If you claim not to have committed a crime, then our<br>
society has decided that the onus is on us to prove<br>
otherwise, beyond a reasonable doubt, even if the simplest<br>
explanation is that in fact you did commit the crime.<br>
Your crackpot theory has no such constitutional protection,<br>
and it should not. (Not directed at you, Andrea. After all,<br>
I'm the one withthe crackpot theory!)<br>
