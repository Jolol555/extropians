In response to Russel Blackford's writings:<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I do find the exchange startling. </i><br>
Yes, it must be shocking to hear the truth unabashed, and freely<br>
spoken. It does revive the weary, somewhat sclerotic politically<br>
correct mind, doesn't it...sure beats a coke to get them senses goin'.<br>
<i>&gt; What's a den otter? </i><br>
A critical person, endowed with extreme "common sense" (so much it<br>
actually hurts).<br>
<i> &gt;A river otter I understand.</i><br>
Or a sea otter.<br>
<i>&gt;Presumably it's an animal that sits in your den (or perhaps </i><br>
<i>&gt; floats in your den otter tank) and despises otters with different</i><br>
<i>&gt;coloured fur, or something.</i><br>
Only tanks filled with liquid nitrogen are acceptable, though I'm no<br>
hurry to get into one. Besides, I don't dislike other otters for the<br>
colour of eir fur or the shape of eir tail, but for the wrongness<br>
of eir memes and the unwillingness to change in the face of overwhelming<br>
evidence that the path they follow leads to certain <br>
death and destruction.<br>
<i>&gt; It's always nice to see some naked racism, just to </i><br>
<i>&gt; remind yourself of what it looks like. </i><br>
Life must be pretty dull on Mars...So the usual racism wears clothes then,<br>
hmmm...that figures. You mean trendy labels like "we must protect them<br>
'cause they're too pathetic to do it themselves" or "look<br>
how righteous I am, I even care about *those* people" TM. Fashionable<br>
indeed! <br>
<i>&gt;Sheeesh!</i><br>
You can say that again! Next time, please say something more<br>
constructive...                          <br>
