I think this is almost an inevitable conclusion of considering what happens<br>
if you apply technology to human bodies, behavior, and society.<br>
Technology changes things it affect quite drastically, and it is already<br>
changing all of the above.  So far the changes are mostly indirect, but with<br>
bodies and behaviour, at least, they are now becoming direct, with things<br>
like CR and anti-depressants, and with enhancement cyborgization and genetic<br>
modifications now in sight.<br>

<i>&gt; Lots of people seem to sorta believe in a strange future, yet seem</i><br>
<i>&gt; unwillling or unable to actually take the time to think seriously</i><br>

<p>

<p>
I haven't met anyone such.  I know lots of people who don't think about it<br>
hard but don't significantly disagree with what I bring up.  I'm as likely to<br>
deny "strangeness" as anybody I've met or corresponded with, as I don't<br>
anticipate a singularity, and I think the "far-out" stuff is generally a<br>
century or more out.<br>
