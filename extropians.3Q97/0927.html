My first experience with transhuman technology came out of reading<br>
science fiction. Naturally, when I finally encountered people who were<br>
actively pursuing these technologies, I had no choice but to be excited.<br>
Sometimes, when reading the posts of Carl Feynman, Anders Sandberg, and<br>
the other highly credible scientific minds on this list, I still feel<br>
like I'm reading SF -- future-things desirable and unfathomable at the<br>
same time. <br>
<p>
I have learned much from these people, even though I have no arsenal<br>
from which to debate them. <br>
<p>
However, at the same time, and for the same reason, the level of<br>
intelligence on this list is so high that I am hardly surprised when one<br>
references a pet theory for no other obvious extropian reason than to<br>
merely pick the able minds that surface here. Accordingly, some of these<br>
theories are pseudo-science and it is up to the knowledgeable to label<br>
them such (with rational reasons, of course). I might add that a modicum<br>
of restraint is generally necessary to end a public thread in this<br>
manner. To avoid flame-wars, wouldn't a private e-mail be the best way<br>
to discipline the offender of your sensibilities? Unless, as Perry<br>
hinted, your aim is to insult them into unsubscribing, I would be apt to<br>
say that enough private e-mail would be sufficient to shut most people<br>
up.     <br>
<p>
I dunno, maybe I'm too dynamically optomistic :-)<br>
