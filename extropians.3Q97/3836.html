Max, dump all my previous suggestions for the evolution lecture in<br>
your philosophy of religion class into ‘suggested readings’ (1). <br>
<p>
The following passages from George B. Dyson’s new book, _Darwin Among<br>
the Machines: the Evolution of Global Intelligence_ would make for an<br>
excellent lecture. (IMO, much more relevant to a philosophy of<br>
religion class than anything about the structural evolution of some<br>
particular animal component.)  These passages  are about some early<br>
Western extropians and evolutionary thinkers who surreptitiously<br>
challenged the religious dogmas of their day.<br>
<p>
BTW, Dyson’s chapter on Artificial Life pioneer Nils Barricelli is<br>
available online, along with comments from ‘the digerati’ (2).  First,<br>
from chapter 1:<br>
<p>
""Nature (the Art whereby God hath made and governes the World) is by<br>
the Art of man, as in many other things, so in this also imitated,<br>
that it can make an Artificial Animal’, wrote Thomas Hobbes<br>
(1588-1679) on the first page of his _Leviathan; or, The matter,<br>
Forme, and Power of a Common-wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civill_,<br>
published to great disturbance in 1651....<br>
<p>
"Hobbes’s blasphemy was his vision of a diffuse intelligence that was<br>
neither the supreme intelligence of God nor the individual<br>
intelligence of the human mind. Leviathan was a collective organism,<br>
transcending the individual beings and institutional organs of which<br>
it was composed....<br>
<p>
"Hobbes had prepared for a protracted battle, leveling his own<br>
broadsides at his opponents, epitomized by his _Condiderations upon<br>
the Repputation, Loyalty, manners, &amp; Religion, of Thomas Hobbes of<br>
Malmsberry, written by himself, by way of a Letter to a Learned<br>
Person_, in which he asked: "What kind of Attribute I pray you is<br>
immaterial, or incorporeal substance? Where do you find it in the<br>
Scripture? Whence came it hither, but from Plato and Aristotle,<br>
Heathens, who mistook those thin Inhabitants of the Brain they see in<br>
sleep, for so many incorporeal men; and yet allow them motion, which<br>
is proper only to things corporeal? Do you think it an honor to God to<br>
be one of these?’<br>
<p>
"Hobbes advocated neither the pantheism of the ancients nor the<br>
atheism of which he was accused. He believed life and mind to be<br>
natural consequences of matter when suitably arranged; God to be a<br>
corporeal being, of perhaps infinitiely higher mental order but<br>
composed of substance nonetheless; and damnation, to those so<br>
afflicted, a temporary state."<br>
<p>
And from Dyson’s second chapter:<br>
<p>
"’. . . would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals<br>
have arisen from one living filament, which THE GREAT FIRST CAUSE<br>
endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts, attended<br>
with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions,<br>
and associations; and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to<br>
improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down those<br>
improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end!’ This<br>
was not Charles Darwin in his _Origin of the Species_ of 1859, but<br>
Erasmus Darwin in his _Zoonomia_ of 1794....<br>
<p>
"’The world itself might have been generated, rather than created;<br>
that is, it might have been gradually produced from very small<br>
beginnings, increasing by the activity of its inherent principles,<br>
rather than by a sudden evolution of the whole by Almighty fiat’, he<br>
wrote in 1794. ‘What a magnificent idea of the infinite power of THE<br>
GREAT ARCHITECT! THE CAUSE OF CAUSES! PARENT OF PARENTS! ENS ENTIUM!<br>
For if we may compare infinities, it would seem to require a greater<br>
infinity of power to cause the causes of effects, than to cause the<br>
effects themselves’....<br>
<p>
"Erasmus Darwin was a ringleader of the Industrial revolution..."<br>
