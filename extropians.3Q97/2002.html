<i>&gt; Yeah. This takes my thread back to where it derives from, Paul M.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Churchland's work (and not just his) on "folk psychology" and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibility (eliminative materialism) that hardly any of the words</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we currently use to describe psychological phenomena have any</i><br>
<i>&gt; actual referents.  Psychological phenomena might easily be concrete,</i><br>
<i>&gt; real, physical, computational phenomena *without* having any kind</i><br>
<i>&gt; of one-to-one correspondence with any of the words we currently</i><br>
<i>&gt; use to talk about psychological phenomena. In other words, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; might *matter* without being *real*, in the sense that there might</i><br>
<i>&gt; not *really* be anything that corresponds to the words.  (Although</i><br>
<i>&gt; things might be different with a future vocabulary of neuropsychology.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously, it's difficult to be clear when speaking of such things,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I hope I'm not just making an ass of myself.</i><br>
<p>
Paul Churchland's view is that folk psychology is false, and that it <br>
is false to such an extent that many of the terms it involves fail to <br>
denote -- there are (probably) no such things as feelings, <br>
propositional beliefs etc. just as there is no ether, no heat, no <br>
soul etc. This does not mean that all sentences involving those terms <br>
are meaningless or unimportant. Au contraire: untill we have a <br>
more mature neuroscience, folk psychology is still the best theory we <br>
have for describing  the more complex phenomena produced by the <br>
brain. But, Paul Churchland thinks, we already have good reason to <br>
believe that the concepts in folk psychology won't be reducible to <br>
concepts in the improved theory that will replace it. (Notice that <br>
from this perspective, reductionism would be the only way save our <br>
beliefs in thoughs and feelings and beliefs.)<br>
<p>
Some philosophers have objected that the folk psychological terms <br>
have a special, normative, status that would protect them from the <br>
fate that befell "the ether" or "the vital force". Some believe that <br>
the folk psychological theory is not so off the mark as to be <br>
comparable to the the like of folk thermodynamics.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; It was interesting to me to see the same kind of process happening</i><br>
<i>&gt; in word that is not obviously psychological in its content:</i><br>
<i>&gt; "complexity". The source analogies (like the disappearance of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "caloric") are all from physics</i><br>
<p>
The "vital force" in medicine was once "observed" and theorized <br>
about, but it has been eliminated a long time ago. Similarly, I think <br>
few historians or social scientists today would like to construct <br>
theories involving such a notion as "blood consciousness".<br>
