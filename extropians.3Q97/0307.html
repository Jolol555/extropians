<i>&gt;Oh, please.  That's not being careful, that's redifining what the man</i><br>
<i>&gt;said into meanings less controversial--evading the issue, not dealing</i><br>
<i>&gt;with it.  </i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what you mean by 'the issue', and I hesitate to project <br>
too broadly what I think that Richter thinks based on such a short <br>
quote by him.  Much of his work was in the visual realm (painting), <br>
and I have not yet had the opportunity to read much of his writing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let's not pretend that the enemies of "ideology" don't mean</i><br>
<i>&gt;what they say; they do, and should be held accountable for their</i><br>
<i>&gt;beliefs.  </i><br>
<p>
Again, I'm not sure what you mean by 'what they say', and your use of <br>
the term 'enemy' seems to cast anyone who does not agree with you as <br>
someone who is somehow against you personally.  I think that this <br>
approach to dialogue or debate is one of the facets of ideology that <br>
drove me away from those particular systems of thought--I might relate <br>
to the actual system, but I don't find the conflict created by <br>
statements such as the above productive to the kinds of exploration I <br>
favor.<br>
