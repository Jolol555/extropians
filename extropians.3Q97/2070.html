To some extent, sex isn't something subject to a market.  To me, a great part<br>
of the sexual experience is being desired and valued.  Really, I can't buy<br>
that.  Sure I could hire somebody who might even do a good act, but the fact<br>
that I would have to pay them would always remain as proof that it's just an<br>
act.<br>
<p>
I'm not amongst the "starving" at present, nor do I anticipate being so in<br>
the foreseeable future.  I do like participating in and reading discussion of<br>
sexual issues as I find that enables me to improve on a good thing; it can<br>
always be better :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Note I'm not proposing to ban such discussions.  I'm just describing a</i><br>

<p>
Yet discussing sexual matters is, I think, a good way to improve one's sexual<br>
desirability and confidence.  For those who think they are unattractive, it<br>
helps show that non-physical elements are far more important than the media<br>
lets on, and that the range of "desired" is much broader in real life than in<br>
modeling, acting, and pornography.  For anybody, knowledge of psychology,<br>
goals, and techniques of sex and sexual attraction allow one to make oneself<br>
more desirable, to more precisely target those who would desire you, and to<br>
make oneself more of a value to one's partner(s).<br>
