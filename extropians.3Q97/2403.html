<p>
&lt;&lt;  It seems, as ever, computers are the<br>
 great equaliser.  Except in cost, what if our libraries started loaning<br>
 computers? &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
"God made men equal...but Colonel Colt made them free".....or something like<br>
that...I image a similar missive might be made for Bill Gates and Steve<br>
Jobs...<br>
<p>
As for the cost...it's getting there...project a little while into the future<br>
and what will a multimedia net capable computer cost?  I dunno...but a whole<br>
lot less than it does now...which is about the cost of a console type color<br>
tv I think...(been a long time since I bought a tv...so im not sure)<br>
<p>
Don't think It'd be cost effective for libraries to loan computers...they<br>
break easier than books...and library books are pretty badly damaged even<br>
now.<br>
