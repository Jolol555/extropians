I've been told for the longest time that my attraction to technological<br>
immortalism was dismissable as a kind of adolescent fear of the unknown,<br>
that I simply couldn't bear the fact that one day this "I" would no longer<br>
exist.  It has always amused me inasmuch as (and this seems to be the very<br>
thing which Clarke has grasped and which has made *him* afraid), it is of<br>
course the immortalist who faces the more absolute unknown.  It is indeed<br>
likely that the "I" I will have become (more likely a whole cloud of us by<br>
then) in a century or two will have a scarcely comprehensible<br>
next-to-nothing in common with this "I" in the first place.  Talk about a<br>
bleak embracing of the *known* -- refuse to make arrangments in the face<br>
of death and it is next to certain what you'll get.  Best, Dale<br>
