<i>&gt;&gt; Bzzzt! Have you further considered that that's because they're absurdly</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; specified and designed, by political and pocket-lining</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; creatures? </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By what basis do you make this assertion? There is no politics in</i><br>
<i>&gt;engineering. </i><br>
<p>
Direct testimony to Congress, for starters.<br>
But there is politics in aerospace development and procurement.<br>
I'll address the "no politics" claim again a little further on.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The more complex a device, and the more severe its</i><br>
<i>&gt;operating environment, the greater its maintenance requirements.</i><br>
<p>
This is tautologous: the harder things are, the harder things are. <br>
But the better technology and wealth get, the more overdesigned <br>
for the environment a piece of gear can be. You don't seem to address this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;You do know the story of the B-1 and of F-111s, right?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; To take the latter example, suppose I insisted on fielding a full</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; complement of F-111s (the B variant, I think) fully loaded with Phoenix</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; on an aircraft carrier. You're going to have hella high maintenance</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; if you really want to keep everything flying; in fact the carrier may</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; never be the same, either:). Those tubs land *hard*.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;F-111s have been flown on carriers, and were originally supposed to be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;multiservice platform. The naval version was going to have several more</i><br>
<i>&gt;struts in the fuselage, a sturdier wing, and heftier landing gear.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Evidently you _don't_ know the story.<br>
<p>
I'm keeping myself from laughing my guts out here. Talk to one of the <br>
F-111B crew chiefs, as I have. They _could not_ get that puppy to hunt; <br>
I'm familiar with the B variant mods, the plane was still too heavy <br>
to land on an aircraft carrier unless you burned off all the fuel and <br>
launched missiles (expensive missiles) before landing. Not very cost <br>
effective. Oh, you could underload the planes, but then they had a <br>
real hard time performing their mission--long loiter fleet stand-off <br>
defense--you need the fuel _and_ the missiles.<br>
<p>
As I said, the decks didn't like it much either. Oh, you could beef <br>
up the carrier deck--but that would take the carrier out of service <br>
for *quite* a spell while there's a war on, and the gross tonnage <br>
gets screwed up, so you can't carry as much ship's stores, so now <br>
the _carrier_ has trouble performing _its_ mission... and around <br>
and around.<br>
<p>
F-111s were developed _by order_ of Macnamara, who *knew* that the <br>
life cycle costs of a "joint" vehicle *had* to be less. Others <br>
*knew* what the mission-role requirements had to be for the Air <br>
Force and Navy. Even Silly Putty can only stretch so far.<br>
And everybody was making money even if the thing didn't work, <br>
so what the hell?<br>
<p>
Check how many were actually deployed for carrier use. I believe <br>
the total number was *6*, but it might have been slightly different.<br>
If you don't want to check, I'll see what I can dig up.<br>
<p>
The phrase I used was "absurdly specified and designed".<br>
I see little evidence in your post to change my opinion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is no politics in engineering. </i><br>
<p>
OK; then the Shuttle and modern aerospace contract developments <br>
like the F-111, Shuttle and America's Vanishing Space Station <br>
are not engineering. We agree. :)<br>
<p>
The biographers of Max Faget will, I hope, address the Shuttle<br>
and its co-option into its current bad design. If we have to, <br>
I'll go into it. However, just talking about Shuttle ops, <br>
permit me to commend to your eyes <br>
<p>
_The Challenger Launch Decision: Risky Technology, Culture, <br>
and Deviance at NASA_ by Diane Vaughn, University of Chicago Press, 1996, <br>
ISBN 0-226-85176-1.<br>
<p>
Onward.<br>
<p>
The service ceiling of a standard B-1 is less than 30,000 <br>
feet. Why? This is *not* the original spec; it was supposed <br>
to outfly the B-52 in all particulars, all conditions.<br>
<p>
So--why? Because late-breaking "requirements" caused <br>
new electronic gear to be placed the only place it would <br>
fit; this led to the center of gravity being shifted such <br>
that the plane can't assume a proper angle of attack at <br>
altitudes much over 28,000 feet.<br>
<p>
I can't prove that the requirements were political, but I <br>
smell a big fat aerospace rat.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You think that there will be less than 1 maint hour per flight hour? It</i><br>
<i>&gt;hasn't happened yet, and the curve averages upward over time, so I doubt</i><br>
<i>&gt;that it will happen for anything but the most low stress flight regeimes</i><br>
<i>&gt;for quite a while.</i><br>
<p>
I suspect the curve averages upward because of FAA restrictions, <br>
human laziness and the litigious environment. Two of these <br>
are correctable. :) I assume you know why Burt Rutan got <br>
out of the kitplane business? Because some _yahoo_ who <br>
put five layers of epoxy over one layer of glass hurt <br>
himself when he tried to take off and the wings folded--<br>
and won in court. Idiocy got rewarded. And general aviation<br>
air design lost a pioneer for good.<br>
<p>
I did not exclude *any* flight regime, and neither did you <br>
at first--why do you now feel you have to? <br>
<p>
Wanna bet?<br>
<p>
My bet proposal: I pick "General Aviation, Ultralights <br>
(an artificial distinction created by the FAA) and Subsonic<br>
RPVs" as the flight regime, and I restrict <br>
the pertinent maintenance time spent to that spent on <br>
airframe, powerplant and VFR instruments (i.e., the <br>
equipment needed for safe VFR operation in 1950), <br>
over the useful life of the airframe or powerplant, <br>
whichever fails first.<br>
<p>
What do you like for the stakes?<br>
Just for the record, 150 hp Zoche turbo diesel engines will <br>
probably run $20k. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;As for your assertion of any visitors not being detected, this goes</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;against logic. Given that some group, corporation, or government on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;another planet would have shelled out billions if not trillions of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;EBE-bucks for such an expedition, the idea that they would not try to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;wring out the maximum PR, scientific, or economic value from that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;investment is ludicrous.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Ah, but why is this a given at all? And who says they'd derive any</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; benefit from being seen? How can you (or Hara Ra) be sure you know</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; what their payoff matrix is for be3ing seen? What if their motto</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; really is "Primum non nocere (at least at first...)"?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So your beleive in alien abductions?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Because Occams razor tells me if screwed up creatures like us with our</i><br>
<i>&gt;screwed up ways of doing things can make it, then any visitors are just</i><br>
<i>&gt;as likely to come from screwed up planets as well, and just as likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt;have short sighted, self centered, idiotic politicians and bureaucrats</i><br>
<i>&gt;in charge of things on their home planet. The ideas that people get from</i><br>
<i>&gt;Star Trek  are much more unlikely than things continuing much as they</i><br>
<i>&gt;are now.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Read Scott Adams new book, Dilbert Futures, in which he states "The</i><br>
<i>&gt;future will NOT be like Star Trek." because people will still be as</i><br>
<i>&gt;screwed up as they are now, they'll just have cooler high tech toys to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be screwed up with.</i><br>
<p>
I find myself unable to follow your reasoning. I find your confidence <br>
in your ability to predict other lifeforms' reasoning charming, but <br>
arbitrary. I couldn't have even predicted how relatively _un_ fucked up<br>
_I_ am now if I'd tried to, say, six years ago.<br>
<p>
I do find value in Adams' generalization that "everybody is an idiot <br>
[sometimes]". Including me, and you, and William of Ockham, who, <br>
by the way, was a _theologian_. <br>
<p>
Occam's Razor kept "real" geologists from looking at continental <br>
drift for a long time. All hail Occam's razor, it never fails <br>
to make life simpler. :) <br>
<p>
When the only tool you have is Occam's Razor, you think you need <br>
to shave all the time.<br>
<p>
No, I don't "believe in alien abductions". You seem to "believe" that <br>
<i>&gt;short sighted, self centered, idiotic politicians and bureaucrats</i><br>
<i>&gt;in charge of things </i><br>
somehow never screw up big engineering, and that's a bigger whopper <br>
than I could ever swallow these days. I don't get it.<br>
