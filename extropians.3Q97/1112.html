<i>&gt;It seems that some door-to-door salesmen were involved in selling the</i><br>
<i>&gt;service for in excess of $1000. while using a retail installment contract</i><br>
<i>&gt;with a fairly high interest rate. They claimed in their sales pitch that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the matches that they could make using a computer would be absolutely</i><br>
<i>&gt;compatible with their client's profiles. They offered a guarantee of</i><br>
<i>&gt;compatibility or your money back. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. The company did not have a computer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. There was no data base of compatible characteristics. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;The legislation, which regulated for-profit organizations involved in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;sale of commercial social referal services saved a lot of people a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;money in the very short term. It provided guarantees that the privacy of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the people who became involved in social referral service schemes would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;protected. </i><br>
<p>
A failure to honor money-back guarantees could be addressed by<br>
standard contract law.  And if customers wanted privacy enough they<br>
could only buy such products that guarenteed privacy.<br>
<p>
So the key here seems to be that you identified what you considered to<br>
be a low quality product, which customers weren't treating as such.<br>
You thought you knew better than them about the product quality, and<br>
proceeded to make it difficult or impossible for them to buy that product. <br>
<p>
This sort of situation is exactly the sort that I have focused on<br>
modeling in my academic work on product bans.  (See:<br>
<a href="http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/whyban.ps">http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/whyban.ps</a>) So I am interested to learn<br>
more about your reasoning.<br>
<p>
Did you consider the possibility of just warning customers that you<br>
considered this product to be low quality?  For example, you could<br>
have printed a flyer which you required salespeople to give potential<br>
customers prior to a sale.  (A similar things happens with moving<br>
companies now.)  Did you consider just taxing the products you disliked?<br>
<p>
Who exactly did you think would thank you for this work, and reward<br>
you politically.  Customers who would otherwise have bought the<br>
product?  Those who would have sold the product?  Those who sold<br>
competing products?  Other concerned citizens?<br>
