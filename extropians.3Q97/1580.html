<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;As the psychedelic</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;occupies the inhibitory sites, the noise level in the brain increases.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Noise when applied to a complex system will evoke whole complexes of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;experience, well beyond mere pixillated snow type effects.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Interesting.  I recently posted to the effect that I now don't take</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; trips very seriously anymore &lt;snip&gt; 'Prelude' to 'Consciousness </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Explained by Daniel &gt; C Dennett, where he talks about dreams and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a party game called 'Psychoanalysis' (it has other names too, I think).</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &lt;major snip describing the game&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yup. IMHO the noise theory applies well to dreaming. Since the brain has</i><br>
<i>&gt;numerous kinds of neurotransmitters, different substances, hormones, etc</i><br>
<i>&gt;will have differing effects.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Of course, even if this is the correct explanation, there's still room</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; for the possibility of hyperdimensional communications from transcendental</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; machine elves and Psylocybin Powers alongside it! But that would make</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the job of separating the nonsense from the genuine hyperdimensional</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; stuff very tricky indeed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Indeed. As one who has traversed realms whose initiation are well</i><br>
<i>&gt;described by T McKenna, but with wildly differing results, I only</i><br>
<i>&gt;conclude that one's expectations are grist for the noisy mill. If one is</i><br>
<i>&gt;concerned with Logos, well, Logos stew for you! And when the</i><br>
<i>&gt;hyperdimensional stuff comes to some practical uses, then my interest</i><br>
<i>&gt;increases - till then, just more dreams.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; At any rate, this explanation of Dennett's had a very 'cooling',</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Epicurean effect on *my* psychedelic experience!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;One area where noise can be very useful is in perturbing the frozen</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotional states and responses which all of us acquire during childhood</i><br>
<i>&gt;and early socialization....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Yes, very true.  There was (still is, I believe) a psychiatrist called<br>
Stanislav Grof, who was one of the first people to get a hold of LSD for<br>
clinical trials, and has continued to believe in the efficacy of<br>
psychedelics for shaking up the old grey matter.  And of course there's<br>
all the marvellous work being done by Shulgin and many others less known,<br>
especially into the use of MDMA as an 'empathogen'.  <br>
<p>
This is really the area of drugs that connects with Extropianism most, I<br>
think - the clinical use of drugs to alter character long term, to mold<br>
one's own personality.  I think right use of drugs (apart from for fun)<br>
would be primarily to balance out your character, like someone who is<br>
emotionally frozen should take MDMA, or there should be a drug that gets<br>
soft heads into some hardcore number crunching or something.  And the<br>
main use for psychedelics, as you say, would be to introduce some noiz,<br>
to shake things up a bit, get some random stuff happening, also<br>
revealing one's hidden obsessions of the moment.<br>
