: just to stay in "good citizen" status and not be thrown in jail! <br>
<p>
I have never been asked for a sample (not by an employer, anyway).<br>
The companies that do that sort of thing are just the sort that wouldn't<br>
hire me anyway, because of my other oddities, so they don't bother me.<br>
They're doing it under pressure from the Official Drug Warriors, anyway.<br>

: Please don't misunderstand me, I'm not defending government in any way. <br>
: What I am saying however, is that a corpocracy is not a free-market. <br>
: A good example was in the early part of this century when Rockefeller<br>
: would open up a new gas stations next to small independent operators. <br>
: When one of his stations first opened they would charge less then<br>
: wholsale prices until the other guy COULD NO LONGER COMPETE and go out<br>
: of business.  As soon as the small-time operator went out of business,<br>
: Rockefeller would raise the price of gas higher than the small-time guy<br>
: was originally operating at.  If you consider this practice fair-game in<br>
: a Free-Market economy, then I will have to take serious odds with the<br>
: whole concept of a "Free-Market" as you are presenting it.<br>

You know, Bobby, you might have been on a roll but you blew it by <br>
repeating the public school line about Rockefeller.  Standard, like<br>
Alcoa, got a commanding market share by vigorously advancing the<br>
technology to drive costs down.  When the govt stepped in to save us <br>
from "monopoly", Standard had been losing market share for twenty years <br>
-- which, according to the conventional scenario, ought to be impossible.<br>
<p>
Now you have to start over.  ;)<br>
