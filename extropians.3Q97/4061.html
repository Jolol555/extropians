quoth Keith/Hagbard:<br>
: ...  A regulation can arguably make things more<br>
: complex, but seems also to result in an information loss. Take, for<br>
: example, regulations on the emission of toxic gases. When an outsider<br>
: steps in and denotes X units to be the highest legal limit on the<br>
: emission of toxic gas Y, the non-complying actor must either arrest the<br>
: emission by cutting production or acquire a new means of production that<br>
: is in compliance. This increases complexity, but only because another<br>
: actor has entered the picture (the regulation). However, the information<br>
: concerning what is efficient, what is Y's impact upon the environment,<br>
: etc. is lost.<br>
<p>
More specifically, perhaps - when pollution is regulated in<br>
absolute language (thou shalt not emit more than X; thou shalt<br>
not emit any Y at all; thou shalt use technology Z to control<br>
thine emissions, whether or not Z is effective in thy case)<br>
information is lost from the cost/benefit analysis.<br>
<p>
It's hard to measure the costs of pollution, partly because<br>
(if I understand correctly) of a political decision early in<br>
the Industrial Revolution that progress is too important to be<br>
hobbled by liability.  Where people are suing for damages, the<br>
plaintiffs themselves provide abundant information about the<br>
costs of a given practice; but it's very hard to sue for damages<br>
from pollution.<br>
<p>
When the factory is liable for the external costs of pollution,<br>
and has evidence on which to base an estimate of those costs,<br>
it can rationally balance those costs with the costs of adopting<br>
a less-polluting process.<br>
<p>
In environmental policy, though, it's customary to scream<br>
indignantly that *any* pollution is intolerable; in other<br>
words, to insist (falsely) that the costs of pollution are<br>
always infinite.  Well, one infinity equals another, so it's<br>
hard to see how such rhetoric can ever lead to improvement.<br>
