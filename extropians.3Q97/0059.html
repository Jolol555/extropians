I must plead E-Prime on this one. To ask what man *is* suggests that man<br>
does not *become*. Knowing one's nature and the nature of the universe<br>
in which one exists is IMO the ultimate goal. If I can finally know what<br>
I *am*, then I have stopped evolving. Since time doesn't stand still for<br>
me, I become incorrect about what I *am* only a millisecond later.<br>
<p>
For an interesting discussion of E-Prime by one of its major proponents,<br>
check out <a href="http://www.crl.com/~isgs/tobecrit.htm">http://www.crl.com/~isgs/tobecrit.htm</a><br>

<i>&gt; 'As a human being, you have no choice about the fact that you need a</i><br>

<i>&gt; logical deliberation - or let your subconscious accumulate a junk heap of</i><br>
<i>&gt; unwarrented conclusions, false generalizations, undefined contradictions,</i><br>
<i>&gt; undigested slogans, unidentified wishes, doubts and fears, thrown</i><br>
<i>&gt; together by chance, but integrated by your subconscious into a kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; mongrel philosophy and fused into a single, solid weight: *self-doubt*,</i><br>
<i>&gt; like a ball and chain in the place of where your mind's wings should have</i><br>
<i>&gt; grown.'</i><br>
<p>
Amen. :-)<br>
