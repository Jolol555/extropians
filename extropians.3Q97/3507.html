Hello<br>

<i>&gt; is about 1-5% per summit). If this is the case then the chances of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; remains reach a facility in time are nil (if any remains remain, not much</i><br>
<i>&gt; left to suspend when you get hit by an avalanche or make a 1000Ft drop</i><br>
<i>&gt; without-parachute).</i><br>
<i>&gt; I guess long-term future is not my primary concern, the next expedition</i><br>
is.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Well.....these economic vs lifestyle things are all personal ofcourse !<br>
In my case saving my "brain-patren" is worth a few bucks<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe this is hard to understand for most Extropians but in light of</i><br>
these<br>
<i>&gt; facts suspension is not *my* priority.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But I'm meeting with Den Otter (in the flesh, so to speak) tomorrow and</i><br>
I'm<br>
<i>&gt; looking forward to talking with him and some other</i><br>
Transhumans/Extropians.<br>
<p>
Well we will convince you :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; This is what I mean. Before signing up (if &amp; when this becomes</i><br>
possible in<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; Holland) </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;You mean it's legally impossible in the Netherlands today? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'n note sure, it's also a matter of availability of a site, none yet</i><br>
exist.<br>
<i>&gt; Den Otter has been doing some research on the possibilities for</i><br>
suspension<br>
<i>&gt; in Holland.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Den, care to comment?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
We start a group in The Netherlands as we speak, called Excedo <br>
We will try to sort out all the problems.<br>
But the Netherlands is a very Liberal country, so I see a lot of options.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; I must be convinced that the best way to spend $50K - $120K is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; freezing my head then I will. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;It's a hedge. Are you healthy? How much is the government (or are you)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;spending on health insurance? Why, if you're healthy? Isn't there</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;something better to do with all that money?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Whats better for you !?<br>
Don't get me wrong here.......I do care a lot about the people on this<br>
earth<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's not just about me, giving it to the a (carefully selected)</i><br>
development<br>
<i>&gt; project in a third-world country might be, in my view, a better way of</i><br>
<i>&gt; spending it. For $100.000 you can have an (very risky) shot at the</i><br>
revival<br>
<i>&gt; of one person in a Holland or the US... *or* you can cure a couple of</i><br>
<i>&gt; hundred people in Nepal.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Might not be a bad alternative... It all depends on how various things</i><br>
<i>&gt; develop.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I feel that if can help save a life at little expense to myself than it</i><br>
is<br>
<i>&gt; my obligation to do so (at least to a certain extent).</i><br>
<p>
OK ! this is a point ofcourse: but you could ask you this question, wtih<br>
every buck you spend. I mean : every guilder I earn can be spent<br>
to a good alternative.<br>
But, after I done my share ( fill in what ever you like )...........the<br>
next <br>
priority would be  saving my "brain patren"<br>
<p>
Sould I invest in the aging research now ! will that save me ?<br>
Maybe.....so I give them a few<br>
<p>
Next: what if they don't make it in time !? :-)<br>
Well......back in the same circle. What I read sofar has given me the<br>
idea that we are at least 100 years away ( not rational, i agree )<br>
from the breaktrough regarding repairing damage, and maybe<br>
even from substancial aging-prevention. So taken this into consideration<br>
and also the fact that you may drop dead tommorow, there's at<br>
the moment only one chance to save me ( as in ME, not just my brains )<br>
If I make it in time to the cool-box :-)<br>
<p>
<p>
Have a nice weekend all !<br>
<p>
Greetings,<br>
<p>
Berrie<br>
