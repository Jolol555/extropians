I'd guess they were named at about the same time, since the Great Dog<br>
is Orion's hunting dog, and it makes a great story all together.  And<br>
while it's quite possible that Leo and Scorpio were named first, Orion's<br>
Belt is one of the most easily-recognized star formations in the night<br>
sky, and may have caught people's attention before they thought of<br>
putting together a zodiac.<br>
