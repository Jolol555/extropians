<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The solar system is around 5 billion years old. Life has existed for</i><br>
<i>&gt; (say) 4 billion years. Even if we assume our solar system is one of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the oldest generation I systems in existence, I still have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; feeling that the time from the first bacteria to the cambrian</i><br>
<i>&gt; explosion could have been shorter (the explosion was likely due to</i><br>
<i>&gt; one or more "tricks" like predation and multicellularity which were</i><br>
<i>&gt; slightly unlikely but could have happened much earlier). The same</i><br>
<i>&gt; goes for the emergence of intelligence among the vertebrates: the</i><br>
<i>&gt; oldest vertebrates are around 100 million years old, there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; strong reason intelligence couldn't have developed much earlier. </i><br>
<p>
It almost did on earth.  Just before the meteor hit that wiped out the<br>
dinosaurs there was a bird-like creature with the intelligence of an<br>
ostrich.  Granted, it wasn't much, but the extinction may have set back the<br>
evolution of intelligence on earth, or it may have moved it forward. <br>
Depends whether primitive mammals or birds as smart as an ostrich could<br>
evolve to intelligence faster.  Is there any data for the relative<br>
intelligence of mammals over time?  How long did it take from cretaceous<br>
mammals to ostrich level mammals?  Idle speculation of course, but<br>
interesting none the less.<br>
