Yes. You raise a good point. <br>
The original post spoke about providing "livingry" for people who are<br>
unnecessary in the current technological market place. <br>
In fact I just returned from Scotland. It is one of the places where one can<br>
see what Government grants ( the dole) has done for AND against the farmers.<br>
While at this time, it is a good support system ( especially the outer<br>
Hebrides isles) - the result has been that now the WHOLE lot of them cannot<br>
farm (they have no need to, an d have lost the skills) - they live off the<br>
grants, and the market value of the wool they produce is now almost zero- 80p<br>
per kilo- and so forth. <br>
When ( not if) the grants are no longer available  - what will these people<br>
do? <br>
The "LIVNGRY" you speak of has "enabled" the corfters for JUST long enough to<br>
destroy their livelihood! <br>
 As with Native Americans, it also sets up a system where the government has<br>
control, a hand out, and the power to provide - and the populace is<br>
"disenfranchised" - or "dis-empowered". Did you see the film Train Spotting?<br>
 He complains: "the only thing worse than being a wanker is being conquered<br>
by wankers".<br>
I do have compassion for these people, and it is sadly disturbing, becauseas<br>
your post suggests, the problem nor the solution is simple to solve.<br>
<p>
 But facts show:  we provide for people in need, we also rob them of their<br>
dignity!! It is a humanitarian’s nightmare.<br>
