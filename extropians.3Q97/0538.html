<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
The japanese project is what probably gave us the idea for the Mogul<br>
project. The mag also claims that the Germans had captured a saucer<br>
during the war, and that we got it when we cleaned house over there.<br>
<p>
I've read the report on Roswell and it was well done, in what it<br>
covered, with the exception that in the extensive coverage they give of<br>
Col. Corso, they consistently misidentify him as a gentleman named<br>
Kauffmann.<br>
<p>
They also have recently done a story on the "new" Area 51. They claim<br>
that Groom Lake has been locked up and deactivated for the last 1 1/2 to<br>
two years, and then go on this really well done investigative work to<br>
find its "new" location. They conclude that since Michael Air Field will<br>
be the landing area of the new X-33 space plane prototype, which is<br>
being built by the Skunk Works, and that the engineers at Lockheed have<br>
designed a small payload bay to fit between the fuel tanks that was not<br>
in the original specifications, and that the Phillips Lab at White Sands<br>
is building various cockpit and payload configurations for this plane,<br>
that they have decided that the Utah Launch Facility that White Sands<br>
owns and is renovating will be the classfied launch site for classified<br>
missions with this platform.<br>
<p>
Thus they have designated this new site as the "new" Area 51, and are<br>
doing a big webwide PR campaign with their site and magazine and TV show<br>
to convince everyone of this "truth".<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, this ignores a couple things, namely that the big land<br>
grab that the Air Force went through two years ago to more effectively<br>
close off Groom Lake to prying eyes took effect just about the time that<br>
PM claims Groom Lake went inactive. <br>
<p>
Why would they waste all of that time, energy, money, and real estate<br>
when they aren't going to take advantage of it?<br>
<p>
One thing PM did let slip out was that they tried to buy commercial<br>
spysat pics from the Russian Spysat agency (which sells them to anyone)<br>
of the "new" site, but were denied the higher resolution pics "for<br>
security reasons". Whose security? THis seems funny that the Russians<br>
can take pictures anytime they want of American facilities but US<br>
citizens can't see them under threat of deadly force. <br>
<p>
I then myself called the US office of the Russian spysat agency seeking<br>
pictures of Groom Lake, figuring that if its inactive then it must now<br>
be an ok site to get pictures of, right? No go. The Russians still won't<br>
let pictures out of Groom Lake. <br>
<p>
THis leads me to conclude that PM is an active propaganda/disinformation<br>
arm of the Black agencies of our government, seeking to distract people<br>
from Area 51, and by association, anything else they say about related<br>
subjects is suspected propaganda.<br>
