Hi.<br>
<p>
It recently occurred to me that free market economics may actually prevent<br>
the formation of really large corporate entities.  I actually touch on a<br>
number of related points in this post.  I am writing as I think, so please<br>
bear with me.<br>
<p>
My assumptions are pretty basic: 1) As companies grow, the management<br>
heirarchy becomes deeper, and 2) a modern free market economy is based more<br>
on the flow of information and technology than on industrial sectors (which<br>
will become increasingly automated with the advent of nanotech).<br>
<p>
Ignoring all indirect cost issues, the issue that really starts to become<br>
important is information flow latency within the organization.  An<br>
info/tech driven free market economy will necessarily (?) revolve around<br>
the speed and flexibility of the producers.  While these factors are true<br>
today, the current market structure has other factors that in many ways<br>
overshadow the importance of speed and adaptibility.  A modern,<br>
well-lubricated (i.e. "free market") economy would add significant value to<br>
technological agility.<br>
<p>
For every level in an organizational heirarchy there is added latency for<br>
information that has to pass through it.  The latency may vary depending on<br>
the specifics of the organization, but the latency exists nonetheless.<br>
This latency exists going both from top-to-bottom as well as bottom-to-top.  <br>
Think of the human body as an analogy.  Based on the size of our bodies and<br>
speed of our nervous system, the latency between thought and action, or<br>
sense and reflex, is measurable but small.  Although it would be useful to<br>
have faster reaction time, the added utility is minimal, natural selection<br>
having produced a nervous system that is "sufficient".  Now consider what<br>
the effects would be if the latency in the human body was 5 seconds.  If<br>
there was a 5 second latency between the brain and the peripheral nervous<br>
system, the utility of the human body would approach zero.  I believe that<br>
the utility of large corporate entities in a free market environment would<br>
suffer the same fate due to informational latency in within the<br>
organizational heirarchy.<br>
<p>
There is some evidence of this effect in the market today.  In Silicon<br>
Valley, most companies never manage to grow beyond the small- to mid-cap<br>
range.  There are relatively few Silicon Valley big-cap companies, and most<br>
of the Silicon Valley big-caps date back to the Industrial Age era of<br>
computing (e.g. IBM, HP, Microsoft).  Yet there are a relatively huge<br>
number of Industrial big-caps.  Proportional to their respective percentage<br>
of the GNP, Industrial big-caps are considerably more common than Info/Tech<br>
big-caps.  Even in the Info/Tech market sector, most of the big-caps are<br>
hardware vendors, the more industrial side of Info/Tech.  Notice that the<br>
only big-cap software companies have been firmly entrenched in the<br>
marketplace since the Industrial era of Info/Tech.  <br>
<p>
IMO, a free-market economy would effectively control the practical size of<br>
any corporate entity by making the cost of not having information exceed<br>
the cost of letting information flow freely.  This has some intellectual<br>
property ramifications, but I'm not going to spend any time on that issue<br>
here.<br>
<p>
It also follows that for maximum efficiency, organizational heirarchies<br>
would be mostly transient.  A possible scenario is a lot of small<br>
companies, temporarily forming larger companies strictly where it is<br>
useful.  This would increase the overall (dare I say it?) entropy of the<br>
market, and hence efficiency.<br>
<p>
It also follows that the reason the government is so inefficient is that<br>
its organizational heirarchy far exceeds that of the largest corporations,<br>
primarily because it has been shielded from the forces of natural<br>
selection.  Information latency in the government is so severe that the<br>
left hand really doesn't know what the right hand is doing.<br>
