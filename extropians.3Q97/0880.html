<i>&gt;&gt; This model assumes that everyone operates as an independent contractor.  My</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; couple small companies that actually operate this way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
As I stated in a previous post, it is quite apparent from the tax code that<br>
the government would prefer it if everyone was a corporate cubicle dweller.<br>
 I too make a living doing consulting work, and the take of various<br>
government agencies (always &gt;50%) fits very nicely under my definition of<br>
tyrannical.  They get to take more than half of my money and in return I<br>
have to put up with harassment and absurd legislation that in no way<br>
reflects my interests.  What a deal!  The IRS regulations concerning<br>
independent contractors is essentially a way for the government to squash<br>
free-market capitalism and financial independence.  Governments thrive on<br>
dependency, be it dependence on the government or on a company.  Either way<br>
they win in the long run.<br>
