<i>&gt;   those who spend their time with other kids? This wouldn't seem terribly</i><br>
<i>&gt;   surprising, since adults tend to know a lot more than kids. Worked for</i><br>
me,<br>
<i>&gt;   anyway.  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>

<i>&gt;  kids AS kids?  Shortly they will no longer BE kids...a useless</i><br>
skill...better<br>
<i>&gt;  to jumpstart learning the skills necessary to deal with adults...a</i><br>
lifelong<br>
<i>&gt;  skill requirement. Or deal with kids from the adult</i><br>
perspective...parenting.<br>
<p>
It's important to know someone who's going through the same things as you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Thus falls the myth that Home Schooled kids need to interact with others</i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt;  their age group.  Better to be helping out in the family business.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Say!  Don't certain despised minority groups do that very thing? (despised</i><br>
<i>&gt;  because of their great success by the LESS successful).</i><br>
<p>
Certain highly religious groups?  The ones that use a many thousand year old<br>
belief system?  Do we really want kids to share the beliefs of adults word<br>
for word?  Or do we want kids that will challenge our ideas?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I'm not sure society is ready for such a concept.  No juvenile</i><br>
<i>&gt;  gangs....vandalism..juvenile delenquency...public schools..</i><br>
<p>
Gangs are great things, they beat down Big Brother (who I know you hate) and<br>
help create the freemarket (read "drugs and guns").  I always feel safe in<br>
the knowledge that there's crime on our streets, it means we still have some<br>
control.<br>
