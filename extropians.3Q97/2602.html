<p>
Um, nanotech (of the sort you're talking about) doesn't exist yet,<br>
so it can't subdue anyone. The English language does have conditional<br>
moods and future tenses, and sometimes their use is appropriate.<br>
<p>
Nicholas Bostrom, in a different post, reponded to Carl Feynman's<br>
discussion of the engineering difficulties we will be able to expect<br>
in the development of mechanosynthetic nanotech by pointing out<br>
that optimized designs will not be necessary to achieve self-reproduction.<br>
But as a strategic point, I would expect that non-optimized designs<br>
would be very easy to design countermeasures for (or just blow away<br>
with a blowtorch, as Damien Sullivan suggests).  In order for<br>
molecular nanotechnology to present a serious military threat to<br>
existing soldiery, highly optimized designs would have to be<br>
developed. I agree with Carl Feynman's assessment that this will<br>
take much time and many, many engineers.  In such research efforts,<br>
open exchange of information is likely to keep traditional published<br>
scientific work at least neck-and-neck with any secret developments.<br>
<p>
Of course, if large amounts of tax money are dumped by governments<br>
into secret development projects, such as current cryptography work<br>
conducted in the US National Security Agency, that could tip the<br>
balance in favor of the scenarios that Nicholas Bostrom fears. (One<br>
more reason to thin down the public sector, eh?)<br>
<p>
I'm sorry, folks, but certain elements of this thread are starting<br>
to look like disasturbation to me.  Seriously, I think ordinary<br>
old biotech is a much more real danger (designer plagues and the<br>
like) to us right now.  I would definitely expect some nasty<br>
bioweapons mishaps, perhaps resulting in millions of human deaths,<br>
long before we see any serious threat from molecular nanotechnology.<br>
