I was going to say 'what if all people are enhanced?' but then I realised<br>
that if we increase the intelligence of everyone by 10%, Gaussian<br>
distribution still remains as the 'norm' (which we could then consider<br>
'Gaussian human') and those who are peaking would either become Gaussian, or<br>
enhance themselves further.<br>
<p>
I think the term is fits, and it isn't easily used as an insult.<br>

"You're nothing but a Gaussian, now watch as I enslave your people and burn<br>
your buildings, ha ha ha ha"<br>
