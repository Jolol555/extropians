<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Huh? I see no problems at all with this term. In our culture red is often</i><br>
<i>&gt; associated with aggression and danger, and red goo makes sense.</i><br>
<p>
Except that if you try to translate it mentally, without having heard of it,<br>
it comes out as "hot goo".  I want a term that's recognizable without<br>
training.  "Blue goo" is better than "gold goo" or "white goo" for protective<br>
goo, because "white goo" isn't Benevolent in the same way that "black goo" is<br>
Malevolent, and "gold goo" sounds Nice without being Protective.  (Note that<br>
in the standard spectrum, gold goo actually has a malevolent meaning.)  "Blue<br>
goo" initially sounds like "cold goo", and in this sense "red goo" would make<br>
a nice opposite.  The police-protection sense, I think, is confined to America<br>
and a few other countries.  (Is it an international symbol?)  Note that "red<br>
goo", in some places, might have the connotation of "stop sign"; they'd think<br>
it was the opposite of "green goo".  "Silver goo" might be as good as "blue<br>
goo", again because of the instinctive translation; silver is the opposite of<br>
black in a way that white is not.  It also has the connotation of protection,<br>
particularly if mentioned after "black goo", and does NOT translate to<br>
ANYTHING malevolent.<br>
<p>
In this sense, I think "silver goo" is superior to blue goo, since - although<br>
not necessarily protective - it's clear that this goo isn't doing anything<br>
bad, and if mentioned in the same context as "black goo", it's obvious that<br>
the "silver goo" is set up to oppose it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; "Khaki goo" is just plain silly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why? It might not be a deadly serious term, but it suggests something that</i><br>
<i>&gt; has come out of a military lab and used by the traditional (IMHO soon to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be very outdated) armies.</i><br>
<p>
Because nobody can visualize khaki in the same way they can visualize blue or<br>
silver.  It takes up too much cognitive sub-effort; the term turns into a mere<br>
noiselike label.  Khaki is not a semantic primitive in the same sense as<br>
"silver", "black", "war", or "death".  This makes the term "khaki goo" a<br>
subrecursive term, making it harder to think, harder to use, and harder to chunk.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  "War goo", abandoning the spectrum, is acceptable; as is "death goo".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; War goo is an useful term, since it tells what is intended, but death goo</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a bit too diffuse: does it mean death to a certain person (like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "quicksilver" I wrote a short story about), all people who are in contact</i><br>
<i>&gt; with it or all ordered systems?</i><br>
<p>
For goo of a unique purpose rather than a general philosophy, or an esoteric<br>
philosophy, a spectrum term should not be assigned.  Spectrum coding<br>
translates only into very basic connotations.  "Assassin goo", "poison goo",<br>
and "chaos goo" are the appropriate terms in each case mentioned.  "Red goo"<br>
can substitute for "chaos goo", but only for Magic card players.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  "Mataglap" would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be fine, since it's easy to translate into Something Evil.  Except that in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "Aristoi", the term was synonymous with any destructive goo, so we'd be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; changing the terminology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have added Mataglap to my terminology pages since it is an interesting</i><br>
<i>&gt; term, but it is too vague to be very useful. It has the connotations of Evil,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which is impractical in serious discussions about goo capabilities since</i><br>
<i>&gt; we are more interested in the tactical or long-term aspects, not whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; the nanites themselves have some metaphysical evil (one could argue that</i><br>
<i>&gt; gray, red, khaki and green goo are all evils, but the nanites themselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; are just tools for somebody to comitt evil).</i><br>
<p>
Nobody is getting mystical about "black goo", although it could be argued that<br>
I've gone off the deep end with respect to color coding.  Having the term<br>
recognizable as Malevolent is also important to having understandable<br>
conversations.  And like it or not, the connotations of a term form an<br>
important part of the framework on which we hang all associated knowledge. <br>
"Goo" has the connotation of being formless, despite "black goo" (at least)<br>
being very highly ordered.  Complain about that, if you're looking for<br>
unhelpful connotations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; "Black goo" is instantly recognizable as Malevolent Goo.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes. I don't think it is specific enough to be useful, but it is recognizble.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem is that it encompasses accidental goo, deliberately designed</i><br>
<i>&gt; malevolent goo and Ubergoo built by Powers that look malevolent but really</i><br>
<i>&gt; isn't (see the story _Kadath in the Cold Waste_ for a fine take on it</i><br>
<i>&gt; (forgot the author, but make a web search for Kadath and Mars, and you</i><br>
<i>&gt; will likely find it)).</i><br>
<p>
Not really.  Any malevolence has the connotation of being deliberate. <br>
Particularly by contrast with gray goo.  Anyway, such sub-connotations are a<br>
matter of usage; the important thing is to have a term whose connotations<br>
sketch, and do not conflict with, the usage we intend to hang on it.<br>
<p>
And, as always, I ain't discussin' Ubergoo.  THEIR problem.  Not mine.  Great<br>
story, though!  And I'm borrowing the term "Kadath" as a scenario label for a<br>
Power-class collective VR with new information as a ultimate goal.<br>
