A good idea. The following is from my terminology pages:<br>
<p>
BLUE GOO: Nanomachines used as protection against grey goo and other<br>
destructive nanomachines, possibly even used for law-enforcement<br>
(nanarchy). According to the entry in the Jargon File, it is<br>
sometimes used to denote any form of benign nanotechnology in the<br>
environment. <br>
<p>
GREEN GOO: Nanomachines or bio-engineered organisms used for<br>
population control of humans, either by governments or eco-terrorist<br>
groups. Would most probably work by sterilizing people through<br>
otherwise harmless infections. See Nick Szabo's essay Green Goo --<br>
Life in the Era of Humane Genocide.<br>
<p>
GOLDEN GOO: Another member of the grey goo family of nanotechnology<br>
disaster scenarios.  The idea is to use nanomachines to filter gold<br>
from seawater. If this process got out of control we would get piles<br>
of golden goo (the "Wizard's Apprentice Problem"). This scenario<br>
demonstrates the need of keeping populations of self-replicating<br>
machines under control; it is much more likely than grey goo, but<br>
also more manageable. [Originated on sci.nanotech 1996]<br>
<p>
GREY GOO: Self-replicating (von Neumann) nanomachines spreading<br>
uncontrolably, building copies of themselves using all available<br>
material. This is a commonly mentioned nanotechnology disaster<br>
scenario, although it is rather unlikely due to energy constraints<br>
and elemental abundances. More probable disaster scenarios are the<br>
green goo, golden goo and red goo, khaki goo scenarios. As a<br>
protection blue goo has been proposed.<br>
<p>
KHAKI GOO: Military nanotechnology; see grey goo. <br>
<p>
RED GOO: Deliberately designed and released destructive<br>
nanotechnology, as opposed to accidentally created grey goo.<br>
<p>
ÜBERGOO: A related term to grey goo, used (jokingly) to refer to the<br>
mistaken idea that during the singularity powerful technologies would<br>
decimate non-transhumanists, and that some transhumanists would see<br>
this as desirable (which is clearly against the Transhuman<br>
Principles).  [Dale Carrico 1996]<br>
