In message 0903, Lorrey and Genen have touched on a compelling concept<br>
in transpersonal communications: the tangent. This prompted me to reply<br>
because of readings just last night: "Jean-Joseph Goux rigorously<br>
analyzes the mathematical phenomenon of the curve without a tangent, and<br>
the direction it is apt to take in economy as well as linguistics: "If<br>
the movement does not tend toward any limit, if the quotient of<br>
differen-<br>
tials is not calculable, the present no longer has any meaning....The<br>
quotient of differentials is not resolved, the differences no longer<br>
cancel one another in their relationship. No limit opposes the break(la<br>
brisure), or the breaking of this break. The tendency finds no end, the<br>
thing in motion never quite reaches what the immediate future has in<br>
store for it; it is endlessly delayed by accidents and deviations. Such<br>
is the complex notion of a continuity within the absolute break." In the<br>
expanded immanence of the system, the limit tends to reconstitute in its<br>
displacement the thing it tended to diminish in its primitive<br>
emplacement." (Anti-Oedipus,P.231). This is my first post. I'm aware<br>
that it may run the risk of sounding sensationalistic, or of a<br>
bedazzlement of<br>
some kind. I am attempting to understand it myself. Yet, I do know that<br>
the break(la brisure) is absolutely essential as an axiomatic of<br>
capitalism, and that it operates from within dialogues such as these,<br>
and<br>
also from within larger social contexts, and is not necessarily "the<br>
pause that refreshes." This concept is closely akin to another: that<br>
surplus value cannot be determined mathematically.&lt;Nomadthought@usa.net&gt;<br>
