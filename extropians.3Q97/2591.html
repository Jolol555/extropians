<p>
I don't know about that. As far as existing law goes, the four basic<br>
divisions of "intellectual property" are copyright, trademark, patent,<br>
and trade secret -- all federal laws. <br>
<p>
Copyright applies only to "works of authorship." It's what most people<br>
think of when they consider intellectual property, and I assume now it<br>
is what you are thinking of since you mentioned software. Copyright<br>
protection arises at the instant an original work of authorship is fixed<br>
in a tangible medium of expression. By this construction, it doesn't<br>
seem to apply here. Unless you use nanotech to record your latest<br>
screenplay in a readable form (somehow) in combinations of atoms, you<br>
have not really authored anything (authoring a new form of matter?).<br>
<p>
Software receives protection under copyright not because of the function<br>
it performs but because of the property interest in the code which has<br>
been authored by one or more people (what if the abstract idea of the<br>
GUI was protected by copyright?) Again, it's the code that is protected. <br>
<p>
So, since trademark law is for business names and logos (xenon atoms<br>
spelling IBM?) and trade secret law is for information kept secret by<br>
its owner that is not easily duplicable, the only real issue I see (off<br>
the tippity-top of my head) is that of the ability to patent either the<br>
process or the product. <br>
<p>
My initial reaction is that this would be a quagmire. I have no idea<br>
about patenting the process of molecular manufacturing. IMO, even if it<br>
were allowable under current law, such a patent would probably be void<br>
as against public policy, much like the Atomic Energy Act of 1954<br>
excluded the patenting of inventions <br>
useful solely in utilization of special nuclear material or atomic<br>
energy for (obviously) atomic weapons.  <br>
<p>
On the other hand, patents are granted everyday for new chemical<br>
compounds. This kind of manufactured product (whether done by engineered<br>
proteins or nanoscale assemblers) seems clearly patentable. A thought<br>
just occurred to me, what about diamondoid? My inital guess would be<br>
that it would be an interesting court battle. Clearly, diamondoid is not<br>
a product of human genius, rather, it is the result of physical law. If<br>
it turned out that there was only one way to make it, and that process<br>
was also patentable, then no one else would be able to make it<br>
(legally). But this seems unlikely for the reason I sketched above.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; We still have not solved that problem even today, and it</i><br>
<i>&gt; will likely get worse. How do you get paid for information and ideas,</i><br>
<i>&gt; when they can be copied endlessly? How can you enforce copyrights</i><br>
<i>&gt; on software or physical objects.</i><br>
<p>
Software piracy is an everyday occurrence, of course, and the<br>
enforcement problem is definitely a major issue. How does Merrell-Dow<br>
stay in business when their drugs are being made in basements?   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In the long-term future one could imagine a shareware economy, where</i><br>
<i>&gt; creators get paid by others on a voluntary basis; since physical</i><br>
<i>&gt; scarcity has become irrelevant it is no disaster to be uncreative,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can simply live on the products other design for fun. In this</i><br>
<i>&gt; scenario the software and designs are free, and there is no need</i><br>
<i>&gt; for copyrights. Unfortunately this is very far from our current state,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and might be an unlikely state to end up in.</i><br>
<p>
I see a new thread on the horizon :-)<br>
<p>
(Have to run now, more later)<br>
