When discussing social science topics there is always a danger of painting <br>
things with a large brush stroke. More importantly, we will always be able <br>
to find one or two individuals or groups that just don't seem to behave as <br>
predicted. To me, that means that our basic theories on social interaction <br>
are not as complete as other sciences appear. We just can't seem describe <br>
all the phenomena we observe within a theoretical context.<br>
<p>
However, regardless of  our imperfect understanding of social or how much <br>
we wish to view our selves as open minded and well meaning, there is a real <br>
challenge to science from a wide range of religious groups such as  the <br>
earth based religions (even the ones that use technology derived from <br>
scientific exploration) and fundamentalist Christians (at least in our <br>
culture). Putting a belief that sees the world made up of magic on par with <br>
skeptic reasoning and experimentation is not as enlightened as it could be.<br>
