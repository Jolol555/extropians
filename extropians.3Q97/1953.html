This company (GERN) was mentioned several times at Extro3, including the <br>
investment panel. I hope somebody moved on it.<br>
<p>

Researchers have discovered what has been referred to as the holy grail of <br>
cell aging -- a find with great potential for combating cancer as well as <br>
for staving off the maladies of old age.<br>
<p>
 More precisely, two separate scientific teams -- one from Geron Corp. of <br>
Menlo Park and the University of Colorado, the other led by researchers at <br>
the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research of Cambridge, Mass. -- <br>
announced Thursday that they have been able to clone a protein that <br>
controls how long cells live.<br>
<p>
...<br>
<p>
``This is not just a very interesting scientific discovery. It has very <br>
practical applications,'' said Ronald Eastman, president and chief <br>
executive officer of Geron, a biotech company that already is working to <br>
develop drugs to combat cancer and aging.<br>
 ``For the first time, we have the opportunity to enhance the lifetime of a <br>
normally dividing cell.''<br>

The stock when into a feeding frenzy, shooting up nearly 200%. It's back <br>
down to 120% now.<br>
<p>
I've been wathcing it all week and I had just about convinced myself to go <br>
in for a couple hundred shares. That'll teach me to move faster. <br>
<p>
It still might be a good investment, check this out:<br>

- --- Quote from above referenced article ---<br>
The twin discoveries of the gene sets up a potential battle over what could <br>
turn out to be a very lucrative biotech patent. But Geron officials believe <br>
they have a strong claim because the discoveries build on earlier work by a <br>
member of their team, Nobel Prize winner Thomas Cech of the University of <br>
Colorado in Boulder.<br>
