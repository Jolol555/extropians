Forgive me for being controversial, but:<br>
<p>
Johnny, a stereotypical seven-year-old American boy, is talking to his mother<br>
in the kitchen, while she bakes an apple pie.<br>
<p>
"Mommy, what was the cold war?" Asks Johnny.<br>
"A war against Russia" His mother replies.<br>
"Why do we hate Russians?" <br>
"Well they're our friends now, but they were our enemies"<br>
"So it's alright to kill your enemies, but wrong to kill your friends?"<br>
"Don't be silly Johnny, It's wrong to kill anyone"<br>
"But don't we kill people in wars?"<br>
"Yes, but that happens in other countries"<br>
"So it's alright to kill people in other countries if they do bad things?"<br>
"That's right dear, now why don't you go and finish building your model of<br>
Hiroshima"<br>
<p>
So Johnny returns to melting action figures in his sandpit.<br>
<p>
Johnny has learnt some valuable lessons that will stay with him for the rest<br>
of his life - territorialism, xenophobia and the need for excessive force.<br>
 These lessons came in especially handy when Johnny joined a local white<br>
supremacy group at the age of nineteen.<br>
<p>
--Contradiction &amp; Censorship<br>
<p>
It's these kinds of contradictions, inconsistencies in people's beliefs that<br>
lead to the bad memes responsible for a declining society.  Whereas some<br>
people blame the lack of censorship for the rise in behaviour deemed<br>
anti-social, I believe (probably along with many list members) that it is<br>
censorship that is the very cause of many of the problems in society.<br>
 Censorship causes contradictions in beliefs, these contradictions weaken the<br>
mental immune system and live it wide open to bad, sometimes disastrous,<br>
ideas.<br>
<p>
The three main victims of censorship in popular media are violence, sex, and<br>
swearing.  There are many other forms of censorship, but these three are the<br>
cause of much controversy.<br>
<p>
Sex &amp; Nudity - Censored because seeing to much sex and nudity will apparently<br>
turn our children into sex crazed maniacs.  The censors have lots of evidence<br>
of the effects of sex and nudity on Children, sex crimes are increasing<br>
yearly and so is the amount of sex on television.  No, actually that's wrong,<br>
sex crimes increase as censorship increases.  It doesn't take much to<br>
understand this, just some simple psychology:<br>
<p>
Sex is dirty, disgusting and sinful, so we're lead to believe.  Then, of<br>
course, we find it to be pleasurable (to put it mildly).  It doesn't take a<br>
wild stretch of the imagination to think.  "If sex is dirty, disgusting and<br>
sinful, but gives me pleasure, maybe other dirty, disgusting, sinful things<br>
we give me pleasure too" and just like that a serial killer is born (or a<br>
rapist, or fetishist, etc).<br>
<p>
Nudity, of course, is also disgusting and so you should cover up.  While<br>
you're at it, why not become so embarrassed by your own body that you're<br>
afraid to go to the doctors to get much needed treatment.  I don't think I<br>
even need to touch on the psychology of being embarrassed by your body (or<br>
for that matter bodily functions - ever wondered why we have the most<br>
primitive ass-wiping system possible, research into toilets just isn't the<br>
done thing).<br>
<p>
Swearing - Fuck, now I'm not quite sure why swearing is censored.  If anyone<br>
knows why we see fit to 'protect' children from words, I'd appreciate it if<br>
they would enlighten me.  I'm not sure of the psychological effects of<br>
certain words being deemed 'dirty', but I do know that some people on the<br>
internet get off on swearing at each other, so the damage is there.<br>
<p>
Violence - If you watch too much violence, you'll turn into a violent person.<br>
 I have to admit that after watching the latest Steven Segal action movie I<br>
get the urge to run him over with my car, but I don't think it's for the<br>
right reasons.  This, of course, is also wrong.  We are all already violent<br>
and denial isn't going to change that, it's built into our genes, if it<br>
wasn't we would have died off long ago.  It's important to learn when<br>
violence is necessary and when it is not.  It's also important to take a<br>
stance on violence, don't make contradictions like those of little Johnny's<br>
mother (and the moral of this story is…)<br>
<p>
The source of most censorship is probably related to the Christian religion,<br>
but I haven't got room to talk about the problems caused by the Christian<br>
meme, so I'll save it for another post.<br>
<p>
I'd like to hear people's ideas on how we can solve the problems of<br>
censorship and any other bad memes we should be fighting against.<br>
