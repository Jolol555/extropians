NSS Seattle--<br>
<p>
Here's an item of interest from Jim Spellman.<br>
<p>
Vince Creisler<br>
President NSS Seattle<br>
<p>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Subject: Thought you'd want to see this: Anti-Cassini Protest Schedule<br>
<p>
I gleaned this info off of the "Stop Cassini Newsletter" from Russell <br>
D.<br>
Hoffman.  <br>
<p>
Thought you might want to have it in order to remain aware of the <br>
activities<br>
of anti-Cassini forces in your neighborhood.<br>
<p>
According to their recent newsletter, ". . .Congressional support for<br>
hearings grows and grows. Our understanding is that now five <br>
Congresspeople<br>
-- Lynn Woosley, are calling for hearings and others are listening. . <br>
."<br>
<p>
There's even been talk of getting boats located outside the 3-mile<br>
"International water" zone --  but in the path of the Titan IV's launch<br>
trajectory (based on a Shrimp boat incident that delayed a Delta launch <br>
<p>
at<br>
the Cape a week ago) as a means of delaying the launch.<br>
<p>
