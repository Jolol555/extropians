Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt;,<br>
<p>
	Thanks for your brilliant answers, Hal!  What you say makes a<br>
lot of sense to me.  Do you have any kind of references to where I<br>
could read more about these "many studies showing how this kind of<br>
environmental interaction transforms the state from a quantum<br>
superposition to a classical mixture"?  Maybe even a source<br>
approachable by someone as stupid about physics as I am?<br>
<p>
	So, then, is a quantum computer merely something that gets<br>
quantum physical phenomenon to represent and logically operate on<br>
information like a regular computer does with "classical" hardware?<br>
If so, then why couldn't this "superposition" information simply be<br>
represented by a sufficiently complex and appropriately programmed<br>
"classical" machine?  Maybe it would be easier with "quantum"<br>
machinery but why couldn't it be done with classical hardware?<br>
<p>
		Thanks,<br>
<p>
