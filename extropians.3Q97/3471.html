<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; So today's poor are richer than yesterday's poor.  That's the point.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That is still quite contradictory. The proper way to view this may be stated</i><br>
<i>&gt;as:   the standard of living has been raised. No one can convince me that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"poor" ( which in common semantics means a life without proper shelter,</i><br>
<i>&gt;medical care and adequate food) give a damn if we chose to think of them as</i><br>
<i>&gt;"richer" than the starving homeless who lived in medieval times. It will not</i><br>
<i>&gt;make their lives any richer. Not only that- to use that line of thinking to</i><br>
<i>&gt;ignore the truth of that reality, to NOT acknowledge their very real</i><br>
<i>&gt;experience of starving to death, is denial of the worst sort, and IMO</i><br>
<i>&gt;downright mean. </i><br>
<i>&gt;One could also say stupid people of today are much smarter than the stupid</i><br>
<i>&gt;people of yesterday. It is meaningless.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Of course, people are far less ignorant today, but  the knowledge required to</i><br>
<i>&gt;live is much more complex, and specialized,  so if people cannot raise their</i><br>
<i>&gt;level of ignorance  and stay just below the amount required to deal with this</i><br>
<i>&gt;new and complex environment, they will still not be able to function very</i><br>
<i>&gt;well. They will suffer from it. The bottom is still the bottom. Starving is</i><br>
<i>&gt;still starving. Stupid is still stupid. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

In fact the concept of "the poor" and of "poverty" as one of RELATIVE<br>
deprivation is actually the most common one in mainstream sociology in<br>
Britain (and I suspect in the USA too).  Thus, the British sociological<br>
and socialist establishments constantly berate relatively market<br>
oriented societies for not having abolished poverty - simply by<br>
constantly raising the "poverty threshold".  What they are really<br>
complaining about, of course, is the existence of inequality, but since<br>
those who earn less in market-oriented socities are actually rich in<br>
terms of all previously existing societies, and most existing ones<br>
elsewhere in the contemporary world, they wish to add the opprobium of<br>
"poverty" (with images of starvation etc) to their critique of<br>
inequality.<br>
<p>
Market and libertarian scholars in the UK havev responded by stating<br>
that this is nonsensical, and that "poverty" in its "derogatory" sense,<br>
so to speak, should be defined in an "absolute sense", ie, in terms of<br>
near starvation, absence of basic essentials etc. It is thus quite clear<br>
that it is market oriented societies which have succeeded in largely<br>
eradicating poverty. It is really downright mean, and totally foolish,<br>
to deny the evidence of history and all rational social science - that<br>
the road to prosperity and abundance is the road of market<br>
relationships. In so far as those relationships are hampered or<br>
destroyed by the state, or "private" coercion, livelihooDs and<br>
prosperity will be harmed. <br>
<p>
Market oriented societies (even a totally free market) can never, of<br>
course, eradicate inequality - but then neither can any other form of<br>
socio-political order. But inequality per se, contrary to socialist<br>
egalitarians, is not unjust.<br>
