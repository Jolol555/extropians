Yes, this is similar to what I have read during my (spotty) studies<br>
of history and archeology. <br>
<p>
It was Platon who wrote about Atlantis, although he attributed the<br>
story to Solon who was said to have heard it from the Egyptians. It<br>
is not unreasonable that the Egyptian folklore remembered it, ash<br>
layers and signs of big flooding along the coast have been found from<br>
the relevant era, and the disasters mentioned in Exodus could quite<br>
well be based on the Thera disaster.<br>
<p>
The moral is: don't build your civilization in a geologically<br>
unstable area. Hmm, and I'm going to California in two weeks... :-)<br>
