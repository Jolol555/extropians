I realized after I posted that long message that I had made a mistake<br>
after all.  Goes to show what happens when I stay up past my bedtime.<br>
<p>
The problem is that it is wrong to neglect rare sequences of coin flips.<br>
A series of 6 heads in a row has a probability of only 1/64, but OTOH<br>
it produces 64 people who have all seen 6 heads, which largely compensates<br>
for the low probability.<br>
<p>
Suppose we ran the experiment I showed 64 times in parallel, once with<br>
each of the 64 possible sequences of heads and tails.  We'd start off with<br>
64 people, and we'd end up with a lot more because of all the cloning (729<br>
people, as it turns out).  One group would see a series of all heads,<br>
and there would be 64 of them at the end.  One would see all tails,<br>
and there would be only 1 of them at the end.  We can chart it like this:<br>
<p>
Number of           Number of         Number of people      Number of<br>
heads seen          groups            per group at end      people total<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
   6                  1                     64                  64<br>
   5                  6                     32                 192<br>
   4                 15                     16                 240<br>
   3                 20                      8                 160<br>
   2                 15                      4                  60<br>
   1                  6                      2                  12<br>
   0                  1                      1                   1<br>
<p>
So there will be 64 people who saw 6 heads, 192 people who saw 5, 240<br>
people who saw 4, etc.  From this we can calculate the average number<br>
of heads that was seen by a participant who leaves the experiment, and<br>
it is exactly 4, so the average fraction of heads seen is 4/6 or 2/3,<br>
in accordance with Wei's option (B).<br>
<p>
However, I am not 100% sure that this definition of probability is the<br>
right one to use.  Consider, for example, if someone offered to bet you,<br>
before you enter the experiment, about the outcome of the coin flip.<br>
Suppose you were willing to give him 2-1 odds that it would come out heads<br>
(because you believe there is a 2/3 chance of that.)  You put up $200<br>
and he puts up $100.<br>
<p>
After the experiment, if it came out tails, you lose your $200, but there<br>
is only one of you.  If it came up heads, you win $100, but there are two<br>
of you, so you have to split it and each gets $50.  Subjectively, there is<br>
a 1/3 chance of losing $200 and a 2/3 chance of winning $50, which is a<br>
losing proposition.<br>
<p>
You need to make the bet at even odds in order not to lose money.  In<br>
that case there is a 1/3 chance of losing $100 and a 2/3 chance of winning<br>
$50, which works out evenly.  So despite the fact that subjectively you<br>
will find at the end a 2/3 chance of heads, operationally you must base<br>
your decisions on the assumption of a 1/2 chance of heads.  The same cloning<br>
which increases the numbers of copies for certain outcomes also divides<br>
any returns which may come from those outcomes.<br>
<p>
So it may be that the most successful people will be those who adopt a<br>
definition of probability which does not take cloning into effect, and<br>
therefore that is the definition which will win.<br>
