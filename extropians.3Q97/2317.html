Living beings have the same problem. We surround ourselves with<br>
impermeable walls called skin, and let the immune system permeate the<br>
inside. If you worry about an enemy trying to blow your walls/skin<br>
apart, then you have to take more active measures than to protect<br>
against random grey goo, advertising nanites and opportunistic<br>
devices trying to build distributed computing nodes out of you. If I<br>
notice that something is building TNT out of matter in my vicinity,<br>
I'm not going to stay around...<br>

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
ROFL! :-) OK, I see what you mean, but it can be interpreted in a<br>
hedonic way too...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; more interesting doesn't mean it's more plausible!) Perhaps the fact </i><br>
<i>&gt; that the defence would also be designed would conterbalance this </i><br>
<i>&gt; factor. </i><br>
<p>
If you know what defenses I have, then I'm vulnerable (think of the<br>
AIDS virus, which uses the immune system), but if I have a system<br>
which you know fairly little about, then it is harder to design a<br>
workable attack (hint: never let your enemy get fingernail clippings<br>
or spittle, he can use them to bring down black magic on you!). So it<br>
might be a good idea to design *and* evolve your defenses to make<br>
them unique. And a good basic structure would give you time to act<br>
("Oh shit! My immune nanites can't stop the infection. Let's call<br>
tech support...").<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (2) What if new chemical reactions are introduced? Will complicated </i><br>
<i>&gt; higher organisms still be viable? Exactly what properties of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; system does this depend on? Does anybody have any idea of how to get </i><br>
<i>&gt; a handle on this problem?</i><br>
<p>
Very broadly, the question seems to be if diamondoid mechanosynthetic<br>
or a aquaeous carbochemic biomass has the lowest chemical energy; the<br>
biosphere would tunnel to the lowest if given a reaction pathway. I<br>
guess diamond is the stablest, since cells cannot digest it, but it<br>
might be too energy-intensive for nanites competing with each other<br>
to digest too (thick diamondoid sediments on the ocean floors; in<br>
time they will form a very fun form of "chalk"). <br>
<p>
I think complicated organisms are still quite viable, since they have<br>
the advantage of fast cultural evolution before biological evolution.<br>
It doesn't matter if their biology is about diamond or water.<br>
