Having re-read what I posted yesterday I guess I owe Eliezer (and anybody<br>
else who felt offended) some sort of apology. A few *very* nasty memories<br>
got the best of me there. Maybe I have become a colder-son-of-a-bitch than<br>
I realized. Sorry about this, I'll work on it.<br>

Can't wait! ;-)<br>

<i> &gt;Anyway, I'm not really sure what we're arguing about. Regardless of whether</i><br>
<i> &gt;modern genocides are as bad as the Holocaust, we both think they're not</i><br>
good.<br>
<p>
Yes, in practice we're saying *basically* the same thing. We just arrived<br>
at our opinions via different paths. Then when 'discussion' becomes<br>
'argument' (why is that? hormones?) and all sorts of emotions kick-in<br>
things become very clouded. <br>
This may also aply to several other treads and that is why I was so happy<br>
with Dan Fabulich's post "Ethics and Politics". He took those clouds away.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I'll handle the ghettos if you handle Cambodia. Deal?</i><br>
<p>
Deal. As long as we can exchange knowledge &amp; experience on a weekly basis<br>
(I guess I'll have to get me a portable InmarSat phone for mail-transfer)<br>
If you happen to develop a nano-bot for defusing mines, let me know.<br>
Actually Cambodia is not a bad idea, lots of work that needs to be done<br>
over there. With all this lo(nger)livety taken into account I might be<br>
running out of interesting mountains if I don't cut down. Maybe I'll spend<br>
a year doing something else and save some for later ;-).<br>

In response to Kennita <br>
 "blessed is the peace-maker, for she can truly be called a child of God" <br>

<i> &gt;And in response to Arjen's "grow up/bloody nose" comments:</i><br>
<i> &gt;This is not a "Toughen up, soldier!" boot camp. This is a mailing list</i><br>
<i> &gt;for extropians to exchange ideas and criticisms, not insults. We're on</i><br>
<i> &gt;the same side -- remember?</i><br>
<p>
I certainly did not intend to punch Eliezer in the nose/teeth, that was<br>
someone called Frank Mcelligott &lt;Frankmac@ripco.com&gt;. He is also known as<br>
'Ass', according to John K Clark ;-). Nor did I intend to insult anybody.<br>
<p>
But my post may have turned out harsher than I intended. Thanx for pointing<br>
that out in the way you did. We *are* on the same side, maybe I'm out there<br>
on the flank every now and then but I remain no less committed.<br>
<p>
Warmest regards from a cold-son-of-a-bitch to you all,<br>

<p>
TOMORROW<br>
<p>
Finish each day and be done with it. <br>
You have done what you could. <br>
Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; <br>
forget them as soon as you can.<br>
Tomorrow is a new day; <br>
begin it well and serenely <br>
and with too high a spirit <br>
to be cumbered with your old nonsense.<br>
