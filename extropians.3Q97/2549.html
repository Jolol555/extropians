Well, to begin with we have Malthus. Darwinian pressure to fill the <br>
available ecological space, etc. Personally, I don't think that these <br>
arguments are as strong as many think when they are applied to a <br>
post-transition world, but they tend to persuade people. The way I <br>
prefer to think about it is in terms of a superintelligence who <br>
attempts to maximize what it thinks is physical value-structures; <br>
i.e. it wants to organize as much matter as possible in the way that <br>
it think has most value. Except for possible strategic or ethical <br>
reasons, it makes no difference whether the matter is virgin <br>
territory or some other computer is has already organized the matter <br>
in a sub-optimal way.<br>
