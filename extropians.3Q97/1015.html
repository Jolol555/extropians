Ska? Cool! I am fan of (old-school) ska.  I do have to say that "ska" as<br>
currently defined in popular media is significantly different than the CDs<br>
I collected from the 80s (and before).  It seems that the term "ska" has<br>
been co-opted to create the latest "cool genre".  Bands like No Doubt may<br>
demonstrate some ska influences, but the music doesn't really resemble ska<br>
as represented by The Specials, Madness, and even earlier groups like the<br>
Skatellites(sp?).<br>
<p>
Yes, techno and electronica in general is a genre for which I have an<br>
affinity.  My personal influences tend to be in the techno/trance/ambient<br>
area, but occasionally the influence of 80's darker synth pop (along the<br>
lines of the New Order, Pet Shop Boys, Cure) sometimes appear to trickle<br>
into my work, most likely because I have a fairly large collection of that<br>
stuff as well.  At one time or other I have been involved in nearly every<br>
major music style I can think of.  I like music for its own sake.<br>
<p>
I currently use Performer, but have used a few other packages.  The state<br>
of sequencers is such that it doesn't really matter what you use as long as<br>
you learn how to use it well.  Having not previously used sequencers under<br>
MacOS, the choice of Performer was completely random.  I don't currently<br>
have any audio recording capability, but I am looking into the various<br>
digital 8-track hard-disk systems, both modular and computer-based.<br>
