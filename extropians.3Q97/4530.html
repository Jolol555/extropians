I am reminded of Dan's proposal for a computer-human interface that, in his<br>
opinion, would lend much to the actualization of a singularity. His proposal,<br>
in short (the full text can be found at<br>
<a href="http://www.ShireNet.com/~dgc/singularity/singularity.htm">http://www.ShireNet.com/~dgc/singularity/singularity.htm</a> ), is that the human<br>
visual system is well-attuned to receiving data at a high bandwidth. Jumping<br>
off from that point, if the available input to the human brain does indeed<br>
explain the Flynn effect, then the interface Dan proposed is something that<br>
software designers should be seriously pursuing.<br>
<p>
First we must ask, what is intelligence? Intelligence seems different from<br>
"smartness." Where smartness is probably a function of understanding,<br>
inventiveness, and (as Eliezer has suggested) what you see as obvious,<br>
intelligence seems to be more a measure of one's capacity for smartness based<br>
upon speed of data synthesis, ability to follow a train of thought (cogitate),<br>
and flexibility in established cognitive method (if something doesn't work, try<br>
something else). By these definitions, I think that over time, increased input<br>
rates will have some kind of effect on intelligence but not smartness. It makes<br>
at least some sense to argue that a quickly-changing visual environment, and<br>
increased input rates, will improve one's speed of synthesis and flexibility,<br>
if not cogitation. In this sense, we can be "trained" to deal with input more<br>
efficiently. But this does not mean we are any smarter. It means we have an<br>
increased capacity, and may become smarter if our hardwiring allows the option.<br>
The difference between a relatively smart AI and a relatively dumb AI is not<br>
the speed of the platform but rather the programming. And I've yet to see how<br>
an ability to cope with higher and higher visual input rates changes anything<br>
other than your ability to cope with higher and higher visual input<br>
rates.<br>
