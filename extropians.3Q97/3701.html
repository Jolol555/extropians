<i>&gt; Yeah, I remember as a child (before my meme-antibodies were mature)</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking, secretly, that eliminating or repressing the inferiors</i><br>
<i>&gt; seemed like good sport.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But what *experience* cured us of such notions?</i><br>
<i>&gt; How did slavery change, to persuade us that it's a bad thing?</i><br>
<p>
Well... this may seem awfully cynical, but what happened was that technology<br>
came along and made slavery unprofitable for the North, which suddenly<br>
discovered that it was morally abhorrent when the South did it.<br>

<i>&gt; : Perhaps I'm from the video generation, then, but it seems to me that</i><br>

<i>&gt; : either difficult or traumatic.  Uncouple civilized restraints and</i><br>
<i>&gt; : killing would barely ripple the emotional surface of the mind.</i><br>
<i>&gt; : Still, I could be wrong.  With luck, time will never tell.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some say that cold-blooded killing usually requires a sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-hypnosis with the idea that the Enemy is not human.</i><br>
<p>
It's not self-hypnosis, any more than anger is self-hypnosis or laughing is<br>
self-hypnosis.  It's all there, ready to be used.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It took a war in which THE LOSERS were guilty of genocide.</i><br>
<i>&gt; To kill Nazis, Allied soldiers had to be taught that Nazis are inhuman.</i><br>
<i>&gt; When it came out that the Nazis had a program of genocide, it was easy</i><br>
<i>&gt; to make the association that genocide is inhuman.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, I said as much in a post that was already in progress when I got this one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : Perhaps that very taboo is responsible for our refusal to acknowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; : the lesser genocides.  Still, we do try to stop them - although not</i><br>
<i>&gt; : with enough force.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wanna know what made me sick?  Seeing Harlan Ellison (a Jew) on</i><br>
<i>&gt; _Politically Incorrect_ defending one of the FBI's famous recent</i><br>
<i>&gt; slaughters of the differently-opinionated.</i><br>
<p>
They violated the no-racial-hatred taboo.<br>
