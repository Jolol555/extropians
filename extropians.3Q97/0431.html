Okay, I'm beginning to understand where you're coming from here.<br>
<p>
First, we must distinguish between ownership and directorship. The<br>
owners of a corporation are you and me, the stockholders. Typically, in<br>
all but the most extreme of circumstances, stockholders are not liable<br>
for corporate stupidity. There's a mess of criteria involved in<br>
"piercing the corporate veil" in this way, but they're not really<br>
relevant here. Suffice it to say that people incorporate in order to own<br>
a portion of the company, hire someone to run it, and then forget about<br>
it and collect the dividends.<br>
<p>
A directorship is entirely different. If the director is not an owner,<br>
then see my earlier post about when he or she can be nailed for stupid<br>
decisions. If the director is an owner (i.e., shareholder) the<br>
directorship rules hold as far that person's liability. That is, a<br>
director can't defend himself against a lawsuit by saying, "Hey! I'm a<br>
shareholder! You can't get me!" That's a no-go.<br>
<p>
If every shareholder were liable for corporate foul-ups, this, IMHO,<br>
would be absolutely unjust. Indeed, for every director to be immediately<br>
liable for corporate foul-ups would also be unjust (but less so). I see<br>
no problem with the current system of collecting the sum of the group's<br>
business activities together under the entity XYZ, Inc. and then nailing<br>
the entire complex for the foul-up.<br>
