<i>&gt; A most important factor in maintaing the "nobility"</i><br>
<i>&gt; branding ploy is the "quest for external authority."</i><br>
<i>&gt; See 'The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the Bicameral Mind' by Julian Jaynes.  People</i><br>
<i>&gt; who've not yet become the authorities of their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; lives "need" the illusion of "external authorities."</i><br>
<i>&gt; They "need" to brand themselves as "lowly commoners"</i><br>
<i>&gt; who look up to and bow down to "elevated royals."</i><br>
<p>
The natural tendency is for people to feel weak and afraid.  Montesquieu<br>
and others have pointed this out.  The Royalty Illusion stems first from<br>
this basic insecurity, which IS, I think, a part of human nature ... <br>
The Royalty Illusion, as you have called it, is a kind of security<br>
blanket, or as we say nowadays, safety net.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Diana phenomenon bears witness to the power of</i><br>
<i>&gt; combining the "nobility" illusion with branding.</i><br>
<p>
Diana is a rags to riches Cinderalla story.  True, she wasn't exactly in<br>
rags, but she was a commoner turned royal.  Same for Bill Clinton in a<br>
way.  I think, in America anyway, the commoner turned royal is the most<br>
effective way that demagogues move up the ladder.  It's the image mind<br>
you, not the reality.  In a way, the Kennedy camelot image was the exact<br>
same thing ...  The Rs don't do this so well ... it must be a different<br>
illusion for them.  But the Ds are very good with this rags to riches,<br>
Cinderalla in camelot thing.<br>
