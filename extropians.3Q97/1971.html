<p>
Many people have the experience (possibly illusory) of being able<br>
to think more clearly, and particularly of being better able to<br>
detect flaws in ideas, when they are in an argumentative frame of<br>
mind.  Argument also represents an opportunity to invite other<br>
people to find flaws in one's ideas. Possibly argument is the chief<br>
means by which ideas are improved.<br>
<p>
Perhaps not everyone experiences the "benefits" hypothesized above,<br>
but if a significant fraction of the population did so, then the<br>
idea of there being some selection pressure in favor of pure<br>
argumentativeness doesn't seem completely implausible to me.<br>
Particularly if that population were in a clade and had<br>
frequent opportunities to argue with one another and exchange<br>
new ideas arising in argument.<br>
<p>
(Then again, maybe I'm just flattering myself.  ;)<br>
