My talk will soon appear in the proceedings and on the web, but here<br>
is an extract. Feel free to comment on it: <br>
<p>
The Structure of Memory<br>
<p>
Memory is not an unitary concept; it contains several different<br>
subsystems that have different functions, properties and neural<br>
foundations. <br>
<p>
The most well-known division is between Short-Term Memory (STM) and<br>
Long Term Memory (LTM); information enters STM where it is stored for<br>
a comparatively short period of time, and then is either forgotten or<br>
moved into LTM, a process called memory consolidation. <br>
<p>
 Short   consolidation     Long<br>
 Term  ------------------&gt; Term<br>
 Memory                    Memory<br>
<p>
Short term memory acts as our working memory, our current context. It<br>
has a fairly small capacity, the famous "7 plus or minus 2" chunks of<br>
information (Miller 1956), and if we are distracted we easily forget<br>
what we were doing. <br>
<p>
The border between STM and LTM is a bit unclear, while some memories<br>
(like a name at a cocktail party) can be forgotten in seconds, others<br>
remain for minutes, hours or even days before being forgotten. The<br>
importance and emotional content of a memory will determine how well<br>
it will be consolidated; shocking, unusual or personal memories will<br>
be stored quite clearly, while the tedious details of daily life just<br>
fade away. Studies in amnesia patients whose memory consolidation<br>
process has been damaged hint that it may take days to weeks until a<br>
memory is permanently stored. <br>
<p>
The Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) memory system has been a favorite<br>
research subject ever since it was discovered that it is deeply<br>
involved in memory consolidation (Squire &amp; Zola-Morgan 1991). The MTL<br>
consists of several brain structures, most importantly the<br>
hippocampus, a tubular fold of cortex on the inner surface of the<br>
temporal lobe. People with damage to the hippocampus have normal<br>
short term memory, intact memories of their lives before the accident<br>
or illness, but lack the ability to learn new episodic or semantic<br>
information. <br>
<p>
                                  [Image]<br>
<p>
Exactly how the MTL works is as present controversial, but one theory<br>
which seems to be gaining support is the complementary encoding<br>
theory of McClelland, McNaughton and O'Reilly (1995). <br>
<p>
The basic idea is this: in order to learn, the brain needs to be<br>
plastic, but if it is too plastic new memories will also overwrite<br>
old memories and we will forget what we have learned; this is the<br>
stability-plasticity dilemma which crops up in a lot of machine<br>
learning. But we can remember single experiences which have not been<br>
repeated, and at the same time retain memories for decades. This<br>
could be explained if there was an intermediary memory system with<br>
high plasticity (fast learning/forgetting) which stored recent<br>
experiences, and then played them back to the less plastic cortex<br>
several times (possibly during sleep or other mental activity),<br>
gradually storing them in permanent memory. This could be the<br>
function of the MTL, which we know is more plastic than the cortex,<br>
and it would explain why damage to the MTL prevents patients from<br>
learning new information. The MTL acts as the sketchbook of the<br>
brain. <br>
<p>
Long term memory is permanent; while STM seems to rely on neural<br>
activity and chemical changes at the synapses, LTM appears to be<br>
based on actual changes in cell morphology in the cortex. This means<br>
that it is not easily wiped, and since it is distributed even fairly<br>
large lesions will not remove specific memories. <br>
<p>
LTM can be divided into several subsystems. Three of the most<br>
well-defined and useful systems are episodic memory, semantic memory<br>
and procedural memory. <br>
<p>
		Memory<br>
               /  |  \<br>
              /   |   \<br>
             /    |    \<br>
            /     |     \<br>
           /      |      \<br>
       Episodic   |    Semantic<br>
        Memory    |     Memory<br>
<i>                  |</i><br>
              Procedural<br>
               Memory<br>
<p>
   * Episodic memory is our memories of our lives, what we have done and<br>
     experienced. It is interesting since we usually learn it in a single<br>
     trial: we can experience something once, and then remember it forever.<br>
<p>
     An important and at present poorly understood subsystem of episodic<br>
     memory is prospective memory: the ability to remember things in the<br>
     future, like what to do tomorrow or what people will come and see you<br>
     on Tuesday (Sellen et al 1996). While it appears that we usually forget<br>
     more about the past than the future, forgetting to do things is usually<br>
     a bigger problem (Eldrige et al 1992).<br>
<p>
   * Semantic memory is our memory for facts and general knowledge, such as<br>
     Paris being the capital of France and that glutamate is a<br>
     neurotransmittor. This is what is traditionally learned in school, and<br>
     the area where study techniques or memory devices work best.<br>
<p>
   * Procedural memory is our memory of skills: how to do things<br>
     practically, how to swim or dance. Unlike episodic memory it usually<br>
     requires a lot of training, and it is not consciously declarative like<br>
     the previous two memory systems; this may be due to the fact that it is<br>
     strongly tied to the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, while semantic<br>
     memory and episodic memory (declarative memory) both appear tied to the<br>
     temporal lobe.<br>
