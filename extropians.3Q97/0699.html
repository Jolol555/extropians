I wish I had you with me at 1 in the morning two nights ago. I was<br>
driving home and saw my best friend, who had just gotten back in town,<br>
on the side of the road surrounded by three police. I, of course,<br>
stopped and approached the scene to inquire. One very large cop saw me<br>
stop and started coming down towards me as I started moving towards him. <br>
<p>
(This is pretty much how it went.)<br>
<p>
"Don't move any further."<br>
<p>
"Okay, but that's my friend, there."<br>
<p>
"I don't care who it is, don't move any further."<br>
<p>
"Can you tell me what's going on?"<br>
<p>
"No, I cannot."<br>
<p>
"Can I ask him?"<br>
<p>
"For our safety you cannot move any further towards the scene."<br>
<p>
"Will you tell him to call me when he gets to the station?"<br>
<p>
"I'm not here to run a message service."<br>
<p>
(At this point I can see my friend with his hands against the car<br>
getting frisked.)<br>
<p>
"What's the charge?"<br>
<p>
"I'm going to have to ask you to get back in your car and leave the<br>
scene."<br>
<p>
(Now I'm getting irritated).<br>
<p>
"Officer, is he going to jail?"<br>
<p>
"Listen, if you don't leave now, you're going to jail too."<br>
<p>
"So he *is* going to jail then. Which one?"<br>
<p>
And so, with that, I was arrested, charged with "Interfering with Police<br>
Business, " and locked up for the night. At first, it was an interesting<br>
experience, going to jail, getting booked, giving the cop my shoelaces<br>
so I couldn't hang myself and thereby spare myself the wrath of the<br>
State. But then it became rather tedious, locked in a room with drunken<br>
college students, bar-brawlers, wife-beaters, drugged-up thugs,<br>
drugged-up wimps, and various pushers.<br>
<p>
At ten in the morning they loaded us into a paddy-wagon and brought us<br>
to court where I waited around in another cell for four hours until they<br>
called me for my arraignment. I walk in the courtroom, the prosecutor<br>
*STARTED LAUGHING*!! He looked at the charging document and said, "For<br>
the misdemeanor of interfering with police business we feel that one<br>
night in jail is more than sufficient penalty for a law student. We<br>
recommend nolle prosequi" The judge smiled patronizingly and said, "The<br>
court rules the charge nolled. Please learn to keep your mouth shut."<br>
<p>
I was fit to be tied, the bastards.<br>
<p>
So then I was sent downstairs a free man, where they locked me up for<br>
another two hours until they finished my damn paperwork! I told the<br>
sherrif that I demanded to be let out given that the prosecutor had<br>
chosen no longer to prosecute my case, and that I am not responsible for<br>
whatever bureaucratic nonsense they had to do. The sherrif laughed and<br>
said, "You're free when the computer says you're free."<br>
<p>
So, I finally got out of jail 15 hours later, all for caring about a<br>
friend.<br>
