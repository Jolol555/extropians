                     <br>
<p>
Racism exists because most animals probably have a gene(s) that makes them  <br>
feel that their mate should not look very different from the average. It's <br>
not a totally bad idea because those who look very different are often ill,  <br>
so this improves the odds that their mate is healthy and that means more  <br>
children are produced who also have the gene. Like any simple rule of thumb <br>
it can sometimes make horrible mistakes and become downright ridicules,  <br>
particularly when you put it into a different and much more complex <br>
environment like the modern world. Such caned programmed responses are best  <br>
for an animal with a brain the size of a squirrel, but Humans are smarter than <br>
squirrels and can do better, unfortunately they still have that dumb gene.<br>
<p>
If you're wondering why so many Extropians have such a low tolerance for  <br>
anything that has the slightest hint of a racist smell, it's because racism <br>
has never made one thing of value and in fact, with the exception of religion,  <br>
no meme has ever produced more misery in the world.<br>

<i>        &gt;Man, having evolved from an upright killer ape, couldn't have lost         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;his violent primal urges overnight (on an evolutionary timescale). </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
The "killer ape" theory, the idea that humans evolved from vicious carnivorous <br>
animals, originated with Raymond Dart, Robert Ardrey distorted and popularized <br>
Dart's ideas in the dreadful best seller "African  Genesis" in  1961. Dart <br>
found bones of Australopithecines that had been broken open so the marrow <br>
could be gotten to, and Ardrey's imagination ran wild. The theory  has been <br>
completely discredited for over 20 years, it's now known that the  bones were <br>
the result of leopards not evil cannibalistic apes.<br>
                     <br>

<i>        &gt;Btw, you should see the movie "The Forbidden Planet" (60's I reckon).         </i><br>

Yes, wonderful movie! My dad took me to see it when I was a kid, the first <br>
movie I ever saw in my life, it scared the hell out of me but I loved it. <br>
Despite corny dialog and a bad last act (Why does the object of wonder always <br>
have to blow up?) it's still terrific because  of good special effects for <br>
its time, great music, and one of the most provocative underlining ideas ever<br>
put  on film.        <br>

You're assuming I'm Caucasian, I will not confirm or deny it. I will say  <br>
that in very recent history the people I admire most, scientists, engineers  <br>
and mathematicians, have mostly been white or Asian. On the other hand, when  <br>
I look at tomb paintings of the ancient Egyptians, the civilization that <br>
invented civilization, I see a lot of black faces<br>
<p>
The recent DNA Neanderthal finding, which proved that we are not descended <br>
from them, destroyed the only rival to the out of Africa theory, it's pretty <br>
clear now that not only Homo Habilis but Homo Erectus and even fully modern <br>
humans originated in Africa. We're all Africans, every one of us.<br>

<i>        &gt;This does not mean you should look down on your neighbor (just for         </i><br>

<i>        &gt;forefathers</i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
Yes indeed, the number of your direct ancestors doubles with each generation, <br>
even more if you count cousins, so you don't really have to go back very far <br>
to find somebody famous. My grandmother loved to trace the family tree and <br>
brag about illustrious relatives, until one day she went back a little too<br>
far and found an ancestor hung for grave robbery. She sort of lost interest <br>
in the subject after that.<br>
