<p>
Good heavens no.  The Pythagoreans flipped when the learned that<br>
2//2 is irrational; you think they'd have anything to do with 2//12?<br>
<p>
The most important musical interval, after the octave (1:2), is the<br>
fifth (2:3).  The Pythagorean scale is built entirely of 2s and 3s<br>
tiered up and down -- 8:9, 64:81, 3:4, 2:3, 16:27, 128:243, 1:2 ...<br>
The only consonant intervals within the octave, in the Pythagorean<br>
tradition, are what we now call the fourth (3:4) and the fifth (2:3).<br>
<p>
Sometime in the late Middle Ages, English church composers began using<br>
a consonant version of the major third, 4:5 (which by combination and<br>
inversion with other intervals implies the major sixth 3:5, the minor <br>
third 5:6 and the minor sixth 5:8).  The true major third differs from <br>
the Pythagorean major third by 80:81, which is the interval most often<br>
called a comma.<br>
<p>
Musical notation, as now standard, is based on what's called the<br>
meantone scale, which replaces every factor of 3 with 2*5//4 to<br>
make the approximation 80=81 come out right.<br>
Scales are formed of tones (2:5//2) and semitones (5**(5/4):8).<br>
Octaves, major thirds and major sixths are true; fifths, fourths, <br>
minor thirds and minor sixths are a bit off but tolerable.<br>
On this scale C# (16:5**(7/4), approximating 24:25 or 128:135 or<br>
243:250) is distinct from Db (5**(5/4):8, approximating 15:16 or<br>
25:27 or 243:256), and Fb (25:32) is distinct from E (4:5).<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, the keyboard instruments that became important in the<br>
17th century didn't have room for all the notes distinguished in<br>
meantone notation, so tuners had to choose the twelve most important<br>
notes for each octave.  (I suspect it was usually C Db D Eb E F F# G <br>
Ab A Bb B, but have no evidence.)  If you played on your organ a piece<br>
containing notes not tuned for, you'd get occasional "wolf chords"<br>
so called because of the howling beats of their dissonance.<br>
<p>
So to limit the worst-case dissonance, tuners finally spread the error<br>
around all keys, resulting in the now-usual equal temperament, 2//12.<br>
This makes very good fifths and fourths (each .02 semitone away from<br>
true, better than meantone), but poor thirds (.14 semitone sharp) etc.<br>
<p>
Now, with synthesizers, we could make keyboard instruments that <br>
adjust their tuning on the fly so that all chords are true.<br>
<p>
I've invented a theoretical improvement to the meantone scale, in <br>
which the error in any interval is bounded by an amount proportional <br>
to the Euler complexity of its factors - if you really want to know <br>
what that means, I'll tell you later.  1:2 is sharpened by 1/16 comma;<br>
1:3 flattened by 1/8 comma; 1:5 sharpened by 1/4 comma; my tone is <br>
32//4:(15//4)(125//16), my semitone is 5(3//2)(5//8):128//2.<br>
I haven't tested this scale, and might not be able to distinguish it<br>
from classical meantone by ear alone.<br>
