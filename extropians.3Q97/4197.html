	Nontaxable sales not included in GNP.  There's the rep for a lot<br>
of drugs there,<br>
but it's overblown, i.e., it's legal but a lot of the business is<br>
tourists.  I don't see them as the major Europeon distribution center for<br>
drugs (Like Mexico is for North America) for a couple reasons.  First,<br>
it's got too much of a rep.  The borders are too tightly watched.  They<br>
don't have a couple thousand mile area from which to ship things out.  It<br>
also doesn't produce all that much drugs.  The hashish comes from Morocco,<br>
primarily through Spain, heroin via Nigeria from Thailand, ditto for<br>
methamphetamine.  Cocaine might come through the harbors.  Small labs<br>
presumably produce methamphetamine, MDMA, and other stuff, but that is<br>
spread out through the technological Northern Europe, including Germany<br>
and Switzerland.<br>
	I'm sure that there is a goodly amount of International drug<br>
traffic in Holland, just like anywhere else, and perhaps more, simply<br>
because it is a major harbor.  I don't see the reasoning behind the<br>
assumption that because there are a few hash bars the Netherlands is the<br>
center of the Europeon drug trade.  Supply generally flows through<br>
countries with marginal economies and weak law enforcement, and the<br>
automatic suspects would be Russia, the Eastern block, and North Africa.<br>
