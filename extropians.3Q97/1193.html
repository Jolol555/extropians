The government is doing great, they haven't screwed up at all.  Look at the<br>
government as your average business: One of the most important things in<br>
business is marketing, the government are great at marketing they've got all<br>
the people thinking they can't live without them.  They're taking your money<br>
by force, yet the majority of people think the world would collapse without<br>
the government's services.<br>
<p>
The government hasn't even screwed up when it comes to controversy and<br>
conspiracy.  A bit of a conspiracy takes the peoples minds off of the greater<br>
picture (they're getting screwed).  It makes people think "everything would<br>
be okay, if only we could sort out the problems in government" rather than<br>
"everything would be okay, if only we didn't have a government".<br>
<p>
The worse thing is, the government employees _believe_ their own bullshit<br>
(AMG).  Because of this the government has become an entity on to itself,<br>
making it a difficult target, there is no person in control of the<br>
government.  The idea that ' we the people' owns the government is completely<br>
true.  The majority of people believing in some form of government and until<br>
they realise they are wrong nothing will change.<br>
<p>
No amount of legislation will better the government.  The more we try to 'fix<br>
it' the more complex it gets.  Complexity leads to weakness, loopholes and<br>
difficulty of enforcement (look at the legal system).  We do not need to<br>
think out every possibility and find the correct solution (something we could<br>
never do).  We need simplicity.  What could be simpler than freedom?<br>
<p>
The government haven't screwed up, we have.<br>
