I just got the book (or rather, it arrived while I was away on<br>
Extro3), so I will not comment it yet. But so far it looks quite<br>
good. <br>

I laughed out aloud when I read Damien's speculation about your<br>

I think that is an important problem, and I can't say I have decided<br>
on what side I'm standing on. And it will crop up again and again, no<br>
doubt about it. <br>
<p>
One thing I found in my neurochemistry reading is that choline<br>
supplementation to pregnant rats makes their children better at<br>
soliving spatial-memory tasks, apparently the choline has beneficial<br>
effects on the development of their memory system. Should human<br>
mothers supplement themselves with choline during pregnancy, even if<br>
we don't know the full effects of this on the children? <br>

<i>&gt; Well, it's not pedantry... it's not lack of imagination... it's not</i><br>

<i>&gt; was that the dramatic conclusions are what will be quoted out of context. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Therefore, every dramatic conclusion must contain, in summary, all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasoning that leads up to it.  You have to write for your readers' readers,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not just your readers.</i><br>
<p>
A good point. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ah, well.  Hence the phrase:  "Help... I've been popularized."  On the whole,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I came across as someone worth reading... and I can't expect Broderick to say</i><br>
<i>&gt; in 6 pages what I said in 40.  And it's nice to be referenced; it makes you</i><br>
<i>&gt; feel more solid, as if your existence is stabilized within the interpersonal</i><br>
<i>&gt; network of the world.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it is strange, but sometimes I get the feeling that I don't<br>
exist as much when I'm not online, interacting with people. Must be<br>
that I have left too much of my mind on the net instead of my brain<br>
:-) <br>
