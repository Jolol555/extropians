   The government by and large isn't too keen on cryptography.  They<br>
usually talk about it in terms of law enforcement, but there is really<br>
something else on their minds.  A number of people involved in<br>
cryptography, especially those programming the software, loudly and<br>
publicly state that their goal is to build a conduit for financial<br>
transaction that cannot be monitored by the government and therefore<br>
cannot be taxed.  I expect most people like the idea of not paying taxes<br>
at least on a superficial level (although it is nice that other people pay<br>
taxes to pay for the roads I drive on), we cannot expect the government to<br>
wholeheartedly agree with this assault on its already red bottom line.<br>
There are methods by which good privacy maintained and still allow<br>
taxation, through some mediator or third-party cryptography key system,<br>
and there are a few advocates for such a system, but by and large<br>
cryptographers stick to their libertarian guns and dream of Monaco.  Until<br>
the climate changes, I don't expect the government to smile on<br>
cryptography.<br>
