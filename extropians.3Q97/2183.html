Hal Finney does a good job of summarizing the best Many-Worlds Theory:<br>
<i>&gt;Other authors have suggested that this solution is not quite enough, since</i><br>
<i>&gt;it only applies in the limit of an infinite series of measurements.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt;suggest that a more powerful assumption is needed, namely that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;measure of a branch, defined as amplitude-squared, determines the subjective</i><br>
<i>&gt;likelihood of a conscious observer finding himself in the branch.</i><br>
<p>
It has long (since ~ '84) seemed to me that what all one really needs<br>
is a way to "kill" off relatively small branches.  Imagine there were a<br>
slight non-linearity whereby when there are two branches that are<br>
sufficiently similar, and one of the branches has a large enough<br>
amplitude relative to the other one, then physics in the small branch<br>
gets modified in big enough way as to kill off living creatures like<br>
ourselves.  This would seem to imply that creatures like us only<br>
survive in the branches with large relative amplitude, which would<br>
seem to imply experimental verification of the squared-amplitude<br>
probability law for QM.<br>
<p>
I was very interested in studying this topic when I was a grad student<br>
in physics and philosophy of science back in '81-84.  But as Nicholas<br>
notes, philosophers don't take many worlds seriously (or didn't till<br>
recently).  And physicists didn't think it an appropriate topic for<br>
non-senior folks.  Had I been encouraged more, I would have pursued<br>
this research idea in much more depth.  As it is, I likely won't get<br>
around to doing physics again for quite some time.<br>
