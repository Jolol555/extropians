<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
Yeah, and it's that high because it's never split.  Pretty neat.<br>
<p>

<p>
No, companies are at all times required not to be fraudulent.  If they<br>
know that their announced positive projection is false, they are acting<br>
illegally (whether under the current system, or some possible future<br>
system that consisted only of contract law).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't necessarily</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe an announcement until I do some homework. That takes some time</i><br>
<i>&gt;(unless a broker feels like giving me some free info). A stock split is</i><br>
<i>&gt;evidence that the company is clearly confident about its future</i><br>
<i>&gt;earnings. I would choose to wait and see if it splits at all, and then</i><br>
<i>&gt;buy or hold (or even sell) as necessary. </i><br>
<p>
I believe that under SEC rules, a company is required to split once it<br>
has announced (i.e. filed) that it will do so.<br>
<p>
So there is no reason to wait.<br>
<p>
<p>
There are some announcements that fit your description, though.  These<br>
include things such as announcements of pending mergers or<br>
acquisitions.  Since the company does not know whether the government<br>
will allow them to make a purchase or acquisition, it cannot say<br>
definitively what will happen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Interesting discussion,</i><br>
<p>
Indeed.  Interesting topic.<br>
