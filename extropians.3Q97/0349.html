You are presuming that alien "stealth" capabilities are similar to our own.<br>
 The well-known stealth capabilities of the US military is first or second<br>
generation and relatively passive.  The current experimental (mostly<br>
classified) generation is starting to utilize active stealth techniques<br>
which have vastly enhanced capabilities.  Primarily utilizing advanced<br>
"active" materials and smart composites, I have seen some *very impressive*<br>
new stealth capabilities.  I was on the engineering and science side of it,<br>
but the US military was fairly drooling over the results.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The most effective possibility is materials which absorb as much</i><br>
<i>&gt;incoming radiation as possible. Some such materials are used today to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;limited extent for radar absorption, but are only effective in absorbing</i><br>

<i>&gt;cannot all be absorbed. Even if fully absorptive materials are</i><br>
<i>&gt;developed, it will then be possible to detect vehicles by the absence of</i><br>
<i>&gt;background radiation, that which is being absorbed by the vehicle.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Some of the newer active materials can not only protect against several<br>
forms of direct radiation without redirection, but they can generate a tiny<br>
amount of return noise as well.  The residual noise (a result of<br>
imperfections in the materials) produces a much cleaner return spectrum<br>
without the "hole" normally associated with some passive forms of stealth.<br>
I know people have been working on computer controlled versions of these<br>
materials that let you modify the return characteristics in realtime.  I<br>
understand that the computer controlled versions can not only give you the<br>
full amplitude spectrum (from no return at all to a full strength return),<br>
but can also modify some characteristics of the return signal.  A very cool<br>
technology with a ton of possible real world uses.  <br>
