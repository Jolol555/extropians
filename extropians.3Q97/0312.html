Microsoft is not evil nor is it a monopoly, here's why:<br>
<p>
It's more extropian...<br>
<p>
The purpose of the Network Computer (NC) movement is to recentralise<br>
computing, to recentralise the power... the whole idea of centralised power<br>
should send a shiver down any extropians back.<br>
<p>
However, if you take a trip to Microsoft Research you'll find millions of<br>
pounds being spent on research into distributed Operating Systems.<br>
 Microsoft's distributed OS is called MS Millennium (this gives them a<br>
thousand year period in which to release it).  The new OS offers complete<br>
distribution of power.  As long as you are running the OS, you are a part of<br>
a 'pool' of computing resources.  You may only have an average Pentium, but<br>
if you want more power, take it from the resource pool.<br>
<p>
Bill Gates has also very much set his aim on distributing power.  He believes<br>
giving all people the ability to create and communicate.<br>
<p>
Microsoft is not and never will be a monopoly...<br>
<p>
Microsoft is not a monopoly.  They may dominate the current computer market,<br>
but the current computer market is absolutely *nothing* compared to the<br>
potential market waiting for anyone who wants it.  (That'll be me)...<br>
<p>
Microsoft don't have original ideas, but who cares...<br>
<p>
Microsoft may steal all it's ideas from the minds of young Computer<br>
Scientists while they sleep.  But if it weren't for Microsoft who else would<br>
actually use these ideas.  Look at Xerox, Xerox PARC invented the mouse, the<br>
monitor, the GUI, the hard drive, the laser printer and they didn't do a<br>
thing with them (please note that anything invented by Xerox PARC was also in<br>
production at the MIT Media Labs at the exact same time).  Apple stole one<br>
good idea, and them became so full of themselves the forgot what innovation<br>
is!<br>
<p>
If you want to see upcoming MS products take a trip to the MIT Media Labs<br>
(<a href="http://www.media.mit.edu">http://www.media.mit.edu</a>), where all Bills ideas come from.  If you want to<br>
see products that could wipe Microsoft off the face of the earth but wont,<br>
visit Xerox PARC (<a href="http://parc.xerox.com">http://parc.xerox.com</a>).<br>
<p>
Microsoft will destroy itself...<br>
<p>
If MS Windows becomes the only OS, it will come with the hardware, eventually<br>
Microsoft will have no reason to sell it and will hand it over to become an<br>
open standard (by which time it will just be a set of simple objects anyway).<br>
 MS may well dominate the rest of the software market, but this will mean<br>
nothing with the advent of speech recognition and AI.  There will be a point<br>
when you don't buy software, you just tell your computer what to do.<br>
<p>
Bill Gates knows this and is setting himself up to become a Content provider.<br>
 However, as media creation tools become more abundant and Media independence<br>
allows information to be stored in one medium and viewed in any, media<br>
companies will fall and information will be collected by those who 'happen to<br>
be there'.  Bill Gates will retire... and everyone will be happy.<br>
<p>
And that's all folks...<br>
