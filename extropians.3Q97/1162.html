A trip to metaphysics doesn't seem necessary.  I'll go with Websters: "to<br>

<p>
You're redirecting the discussion into the limits of our epistemology.  Yes,<br>
we know things only through sense data; yes we are fallible.  But,<br>
nonetheless, there is a universe out there, independent of us.  If all humans<br>
died tomorrow the bacteria and the Virgo cluster would still be there, and<br>
the chair would last quite a while.<br>
<p>
I am as confident of the chair as I can be of anything; I have extensive<br>
sense evidence of its endelbrot set, and strong theoretical reasons to<br>
believe it can't exist in this universe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I can't detect The Mandelbrot Set </i><br>
<i>&gt;directly, only through the  "lens" of a computer, but at least it shows me </i><br>
<i>&gt;the set as it is now.</i><br>
<p>
The sense impressions of the real things you mentioned were formed from the<br>
actual things.  The Mandelbrot set sense impressions were formed from a<br>
finite approximation to the Mandelbrot set.  And, as you pointed out, finite<br>
representations of the Mandelbrot set are *very* different from the actual<br>
Mandelbrot set.  I can make a program that creates the sense impressions I'd<br>
get from the Easter Bunny, and use it for wallpaper, but there's still no<br>
Easter Bunny.<br>
