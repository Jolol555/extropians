:     I consider extropians very intelligent and gifted people.  It is my<br>

:     mentalities than there are say..."liberal arts" mentalities.  [...]<br>
:<br>
:     I know each group can't survive (well) without the other.  We are<br>
:     polarized but dependent on one another.  A yin/yang, right-brain,<br>
:     left-brain, positive/negative, zero/one opposites attract type of<br>
:     thing.  When the artsy-fartsy types (like moi) get too out there, I<br>
:     often NEED someone to say "Earth to Rick".  When the calculating,<br>
:     empirical types reach their version of critical mass, they too need<br>
:     some reconnection from "the other side".  [...]<br>

Look, Rick, I'm willing to try to understand your language;<br>
I'm willing to try to explain when my language leaves you<br>
scratching your head -- but I'm not going to abandon my kind<br>
of clarity for a clumsy imitation of your kind of warmth.<br>
Don't assume, because of that, that I am ignorant of ethics.<br>
<p>
But if I do lack compassion, well - tough shit.  I'm not<br>
going to acquire it just because you tell me I ought to.<br>
Does that mean we can't work together?<br>
