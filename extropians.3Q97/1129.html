I am considering the following three research projects for my new 2 yr<br>
position as a health policy scholar at UC Berkeley.  My immediate goal<br>
is to get a tenure-track position after this one, which I think will<br>
require that I focus in more depth on a single topic than I have in<br>
the past.  I'm interested in advice/preferences regarding my choice.<br>
<p>
The three projects are:<br>
<p>
1) "Incentive Contracts" (<a href="http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/buyhealth.html">http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/buyhealth.html</a>)<br>
<p>
    Examine more closely my proposal to bundle health and life<br>
insurance, in order to give caregivers a more direct incentive to<br>
support health.  Its a good idea for a product, but the problem<br>
academically is the product idea is too simple and has never been<br>
tried.  Academics would rather hear a theory to explain why this<br>
product isn't offered, or data on actual trials so see if it works<br>
better.  This project could lead into a health economist position.<br>
<p>
2) "Explaining Product Bans" (<a href="http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/whyban.ps">http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/whyban.ps</a>)<br>
<p>
    Elaborate and test my theory of product bans as a response to the<br>
cheap-talk nature of warning labels.  Theoretically, I could allow<br>
regulators to tax products, in addition to labeling and banning them.<br>
Empirically, I could see if this theory can explain statistical<br>
regularities in actual ban vs. labeling choices in some health area<br>
(such as drug approval or professional licensing).  This project could<br>
lead to positions in either public economics, public policy, or<br>
political science.<br>
<p>
3) "Why Do We Disagree?" (<a href="http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/calibration.ps">http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/calibration.ps</a>)<br>
<p>
    Elaborate my theoretical result that error-prone but "savvy"<br>
agents cannot disagree for information reasons.  Perhaps do<br>
anthropological-style interviews of pairs of people who disagree on<br>
specific health policy questions, to suggest hypotheses for more<br>
formal empirical and/or experimental study.  This project might lead<br>
to a position in political science, where they approve of such<br>
methodogical breadth.  It might also lead to a position as an economic<br>
theorist, though economists don't care for interview methods.<br>
