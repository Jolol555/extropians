Not necessarily.  Ectogenesis will be a next lifegiver.  Also when a woman<br>
no longer has fertile eggs, or eggs that do not have the proper balance of<br>
E2 and FSH, she cannot reclaim a traditional position of life giver without<br>
the aid of age reversal, or cloning from her own cells.<br>

An instinctive trait, indeed.<br>
<p>

<p>
I thought we was already there.<br>

<p>
Busy managing affairs and heading organizations, not to mention establishing<br>
structures and delving into entrepreneurial startups while making babies, or<br>
thinking about it, and caring for our loved ones -;)<br>
