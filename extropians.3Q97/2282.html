<i>&gt;   &gt; It's time we stopped granting rights and started taking them away.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt; Such as the right to discriminate, something society and government </i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt; passed out many years ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  To discriminate is to distinguish, and the right to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  discriminate arises in the ability to discriminate, which does</i><br>
<i>&gt;  not originate with the government.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The right to discriminate is the right to choose your associates.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Free association is the ability to control (in the long term) your</i><br>
<i>&gt;  own future development... it is part and parcel of the task of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  self-creation.</i><br>
<p>
When I mentioned discrimination being passed out by the government, I meant<br>
in terms of legislation made to empower a certain race/gender/sexuality and<br>
hinder another.  The entire point of the post was to stop giving rights and<br>
start taking away the ones that empowered one person over another.  I was<br>
calling for less government, not more.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  It seems to me that you are preaching universal love. Now, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  older I get, the fonder I become of the old ideal of universal</i><br>
<i>&gt;  love.  But we are born lions, one and all, and it's always</i><br>
<i>&gt;  struck me as pointless and obtuse to quack about universal love</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to fourteen-year-old boys who will *mostly* have no idea what the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  heck you're talking about no matter how long you quack. I know</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that I certainly wouldn't have. Perhaps in the era of uploads,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  we'll be able to start hacking up our legacy code, and it will</i><br>
<i>&gt;  be interesting to see what the old ideal of universal love</i><br>
<i>&gt;  grows into in *that* environment. (Note: I'm not accusing you</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of quacking, just pointing out that universal love is one of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  those things that is much quacked about.)</i><br>
<p>
I would be the last person to preach universal love, of all the people I've<br>
met in my life time I would say I could resist beating-the-hell out of 10%,<br>
respect 1%, like 0.1% and love 0.01%.  I hope that when uploaded there is<br>
more competition, deference's of opinion and out-right hate.  But, of course,<br>
when uploaded the colour of your skin, your gender and your sexuality no<br>
longer matter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  But you can't enforce universal love through legislation, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;  is what anti-discrimination legislation attempts to do. Forcing</i><br>
<i>&gt;  people to do what you are telling them is good for them arouses</i><br>
<i>&gt;  tremendous amounts of resentment, and rightly so. Morality and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  legislation should be firewalled apart, IMHO.</i><br>
<p>
The key-phrase in my post was "start taking rights away".  What legislation<br>
does is give a white man rights over a black man, then give a black man<br>
rights to counter act the balance.  I'm saying the answer is to take away the<br>
white mans rights over the black man.  Don't *let* them ride at the front of<br>
the bus, *stop* making them ride at the back - there is a difference!  The<br>
difference is subtraction and addition, presently we solve problems with<br>
additional legislation when we should be decreasing legislation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Personally, what I feel toward those people who have for decades</i><br>
<i>&gt;  shaped their own personal development by filtering out all information</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that was not offered by people of their own race, class, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  gender... is pity.  And I'm really not very fond of feeling pitying.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (Read too much Nietzsche, heh heh.) Wisdom is funny stuff, and I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  suspect that it, too, is still tinted and tinged with the colors</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of race, class, and gender. Personally I have tremendously benefited</i><br>
<i>&gt;  from paying attention to and trying to absorb some women's wisdom,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  black people's wisdom, stuff that is invaluable to me and very</i><br>
<i>&gt;  difficult to find when I go browsing among white men's wisdom. But</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I was initially programmed as a white man, and so I think it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  perfectly okay for me to have a taste for white men's wisdom. But</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I think I'm much stronger and much happier now for having sought</i><br>
<i>&gt;  out the wisdom of the women and the black people that I have been</i><br>
<i>&gt;  lucky enough to meet.</i><br>
<p>
The point is you shouldn't be happy to absorb wisdom from some black people<br>
and some women.  You should absorb wisdom based on its merit.  I'm not saying<br>
that we should make all people accept everyone, I'm saying that there's<br>
nothing to accept.  The fact that you said 'I was initially programmed as a<br>
white man' is exactly the point.  When we talk of stopping racism, sexism,<br>
and all the other isms we just continue programming 'white men' and then add<br>
a sugar coating of 'acceptance' so they'll be more presentable in the modern<br>
world.  It's time we simply stopped programming.<br>
