Thanks for the reference, I wasn't aware of it.  I presume you're talking<br>
about his paper that appeared in "Interstellar Migration and the Human<br>
Experience".<br>
<p>
Well, I don't have Crisell's paper to compare with.  But I suspect his work,<br>
like that of Beech, was dedicated to *extending* the lifetime of the Sun,<br>
whereas I want to *shorten* it.  They want to carefully husband resources,<br>
whereas I want to extract as much as possible as quickly as possible.  By<br>
making the whole mass of the Sun into fodder for controlled fusion, we<br>
should be able to 'burn down' the Sun much more quickly than it is doing the<br>
job by itself.  (This assumes that it is possible to feed a fusion reactor<br>
on protons, which might not be possible.)<br>
<p>
Now I've got to track down these papers...<br>
