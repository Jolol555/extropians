Yes, but that doesn't mean that those systems didn't make sense at the<br>
time; clearly not using contraceptives was a gain for a small community of<br>
Jews in a hostile area, and I once read an analysis of Old Testament<br>
dietary laws which showed that they probably prevented outbreaks of numerous <br>
diseases. <br>

<p>
In the end, the problem was simple: despite its nuclear superiority, <br>
there was no way the US could win a war against Russia, because the nukes <br>
of the time were so low-tech. Sure, they could have devastated large <br>
parts of the big cities, but they'd still have required an infantry <br>
invasion to capture them, and we all know how effective that has been <br>
against Russia in the past.<br>
<p>
This is also a good example of why attempts to control nanotech<br>
information will fail; some of the scientists involved in the Manhattan<br>
Project gave the information to the Russians because they could see the<br>
obvious dangers of a world with only one nuclear power. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps it was just sheer luck that WWIII never happened. But </i><br>
<i>&gt; somebody could argue that: "it is really only since the collapse of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the Sovjet Union that USA has begun to behave virtuosly.</i><br>
<p>
Are we both talking about the same USA here? 'Virtuous' is hardly the word<br>
I would choose to describe the actions of the US Government. If anything<br>
they're trying to drag the rest of the world down to their level of<br>
corruption. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That would not mean exterminating their populations, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; dissolving their military machines and doing whatever it takes to </i><br>
<i>&gt; make sure they never obtain a dangerous level nanotechnology </i><br>
<i>&gt; (relative to the defenses that the rest of the world has).</i><br>
<p>
But, of course, the FBI will require a 'back-door' into all nano defences<br>
for 'national security' reasons, and it will soon be exploited by other<br>
bad guys too. You still seem to be talking purely theoretically and<br>
ignoring the reality of human interactions, or the limitations of the<br>
technology. <br>

<p>
P.S. As for a world where everyone has nukes, a recent post on the<br>
Cypherpunks list mentioned that the Russian government is about to<br>
announce that they've 'lost' a hundred man-portable nukes. Presumably this<br>
is supposed to make us clamour for further irrelevant restrictions on<br>
cryptography, guns, fertilizer, 'militias', etc.<br>
