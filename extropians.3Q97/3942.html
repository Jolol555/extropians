I love it. Now to benefit from it. Anyone have a good idea of what will<br>
happen on the financial markets? What will the Feds do? Will they have<br>
to finance the budget completely by bond issues? If so, expect interest<br>
rates to go thru the roof to soak up that much new debt on the market.<br>
<p>
So here are some tips:<br>
Get out of any Adjustable Rate Mortgages you are in, and try to<br>
consolidate as much of your debt as you can in gov't backed loans, just<br>
so you can default easily when the banks call in older low interest<br>
debt. Get out of stocks in late 1998 and into cash. Cash in your own<br>
safe, not in a bank, CD, money market, etc. In late July thru Oct. 1999,<br>
as bond prices are dirt cheap and interest rates are sky high, start<br>
buying bonds. Despite the fear mongering, the gov't will not default. It<br>
will however rack up astounding amounts of debt that will trigger a wave<br>
of deflation. Money will become worth something again, however the gov't<br>
will likely react by printing more of it than normally needed, else the<br>
draw on the money markets will cause a depression worldwide. After<br>
everything sorts out several years later, there should be a whole new<br>
generation of Banker Barons who made it on the bond rollercoaster.<br>
