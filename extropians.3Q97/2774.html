<i>&gt; Our discussion about the strategic situation after and during the</i><br>

<p>
I think you are right about argument one, but I disagree with<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2. An immune system wouldn't work unless it was global.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3. In the absence of a global immune system, if everybody could make</i><br>

<i>&gt; extinct.</i><br>
<p>
I have not yet had the time to read through the debate about how<br>
much more (or less) efficient nanites would be compared to blife<br>
in a terrestrial environment, but so far I have not yet seen any<br>
evidence that nanomachines that are not designed as biosphere-wipers<br>
would out-compete blife. <br>
<p>
I would also like to point out that if there are local immune<br>
systems, then they would protect everything in them but not<br>
the biosphere outside, so we might end up with "islands" or "nations"<br>
of different immune systems. <br>
<p>
<p>
I plan to spend a while this weekend reviewing the discussion and<br>
trying to untangle the various assumptions people have, and separate<br>
fact (and logical conclusions from fact) from speculation. I think<br>
this kind of consensus-description is a good idea, although I<br>
have the feeling that Nicholas has biased it a bit in his direction<br>
rather than the consensus perceived by (say) me. Darn belief bias. <br>
