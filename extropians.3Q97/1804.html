      We used to be a partnership society, before we got corrupted (the fall <br>

      think we will go back to it, although it may feel like matriarchal, <br>
      because we have been so used to the patriarchal.<br>

      Are you regarding the Adam and Eve story as literal or archetypal.  <br>
      Although I think the staying power of suchs myths implies that they <br>
      have archetypal significance, any other conveyance seems to be <br>
      completely illogical (like Santa, tooth fairy, the Easter bunny).<br>

Ya, I meant that they represent the fall of man, I dont believe all that<br>
about making the woman out of man's rib dust or whatever, but I think its a<br>
metaphor for something.<br>
