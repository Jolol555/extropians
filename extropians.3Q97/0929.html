Ah, thank you.  I knew there was another system I was forgetting.  What<br>
ever happened to that thread about improving list quality?  Shall we revive<br>
it?<br>

<p>
I think it is largely intended as a clubhouse.  Mailing lists are pretty<br>
inefficient methods of proselytization, but they can be good venues for<br>
current believers to keep in touch and keep up-to-date.  The preaching and<br>
introduction can then be left to the magazine, or to our individual contact<br>
with Outsiders(tm).<br>

<p>
I was mostly curious, since someone had suggested Genen might be trolling<br>
for flame responses, and the dues requirement would be evidence about the<br>
likelihood of that.  I agree with you that charging for admission would not<br>
in and of itself be sufficient help for s/n.<br>
