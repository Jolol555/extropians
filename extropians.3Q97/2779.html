You don't need to be very clever to fool somebody who deep down really want's <br>
to be fooled. Confession time, I've never told anyone this before but I think <br>
the statute of limitations has run out. When I was about ten I made a hot air <br>
balloon from several transparent dry cleaning bags, soda straws, scotch tape,<br>
and a few dozen birthday candles, one night I launched it. I though that if <br>
it worked at all it would only go up a few feet but It worked far better than <br>
I dreamed, it went up several hundred feet and then the wind took it. <br>
My joy started to fade when it dawned on me that I was being incredibly <br>
stupid, I became terrified it would land on somebody's roof and start a fire. <br>
I chased it for about a mile on my bicycle and then lost it, I fearfully <br>
listened for sirens but heard nothing. The next morning feeling like a <br>
criminal I read the local newspaper looking for unexplained fires but <br>
fortunately didn't find any, but I did read a story about weird lights seen <br>
in the sky that could not possibly have had an earthly origin. I never did <br>
find out where it landed.                           <br>
