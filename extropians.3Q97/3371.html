Ahhhhhh.  Sigh.  Alas, to my disappointment, I see that none of you <br>
have been able to see past your own success.  It is obvious from your <br>
posts that most of you live in the valley where success grows on trees.  <br>
Take a trip to the Midwest and tell me what you see.  Most of you remind me <br>
of Marie Antoinette when she said "let them eat cake!".   I will try to <br>
address everyone's arguments in this post.<br>
<p>
Eric Watt Forste said: High taxes, perhaps?  Heavy regulation and <br>
mandates?<br>
<p>
Me: I don't know - you tell me.  And then prove it.<br>
<p>
Eric: Yes.  And for much of those 25 years, the public sector's share <br>
of the economy has been increasing.  Could there be a connection?<br>
<p>
Me:  Yes, that public share you speak of is that small minority who <br>
has in one way or another scored it big over the last 10 years.  The <br>
remaining vast majority have no share in it. Please, lets get back to the  <br>
~80% I'm speaking of.<br>
<p>
Eric: Okay, but when they leave benefited jobs to go to temp work, are <br>
they getting enough of a pay increase to more than compensate for the <br>
loss of benefits and "job security"?<br>
<p>
Me:  Absolutely not.  That's why most families need 2 breadwinners <br>
now..<br>
<p>
Eric: Who conducted the poll?  What was the methodology of the poll?<br>
Certainly I have less job security than ever before... I planned it <br>
that way.  Job security isn't something I find<br>
desirable.<br>
<p>
Me: USA Today.  Job insecurity might be okay for you when you have an <br>
IQ over 140 and computer skills to equip an army.  But what about the <br>
rest of the country who have kids to raise, let alone having even touched <br>
a computer?<br>
<p>
Eric: Um, what is wrong with working 50 and 60 hour workweeks if that <br>
is what you want to do?  My own work pattern has been lately developing <br>
into working for several months, and then not working at all for<br>
six weeks or so.  Ideally I'd like to have a pattern of six months on, <br>
six months off. None of the figures you present indicate that this <br>
couldn't be happening with most of the people you are worrying about.<br>
<p>
Me: Nothing is wrong with working 60 hours/wk if thats what *you want <br>
to do*.  Most people hate their jobs - they do it because they have to <br>
survive.  Again, I'm glad you have the luxury, high IQ and skills to <br>
design your own flex-schedule - most do not have that option.  Where have <br>
you been?  Obviously you've spent way to long in your cybernetic ivory <br>
tower to notice (I hear Marie Antoinette again).<br>
<p>
Eric: Job security is not an objectively good thing.  <br>
<p>
Me: Don't tell that to the average working family or they'll likely <br>
draw and quarter you.<br>
<p>
Eric: Also, your "increasingly unnecessary" claim is totally <br>
unsubstantiated.<br>
<p>
Me:  Tell that to the people who have been automated out of a job.  <br>
All I'm asking is for you to tell me what people of average IQ, little <br>
money and little skill are going to do when the majority of the economy has <br>
been automated?  Most of these people are not collected money from <br>
mutual funds even if they knew how.  Are you saying invest money or die?<br>
<p>
Eric: I have zero interest in watching the rest of humanity languish <br>
to death, and I doubt many other list members do, and it's pretty <br>
offensive of you to imply that this is something we want to do.<br>
<p>
Me: I'm glad to hear it and I apologize to you if I implied you were <br>
lacking in conscience.  That's why I'm asking the question: Extro-Nazi's <br>
or Extro-Saint?<br>
<p>
Eric: Criticism without offering suggested alternatives is sterile. <br>
<p>
Me:  Probably true, but that's why I'm posted this stuff - I want to <br>
hear your alternatives as I have found none myself.  A long time ago, <br>
RAW's RICH economy seemed the ideal solution - unfortunately I have not <br>
figured out a way to implement it as the free-market seems to prevent it <br>
from occurring.  After all, we can't have 80%+ of the population lying <br>
around watching TV, having sex and smoking pot, can we?  They must all <br>
work, work, work!  'Get to work wage slaves!' - is all I have been hearing <br>
these days.<br>
<p>
To summarize Damien R. Sullivan:<br>
<p>
So he says, as he types away on his computer. Farmers used to be far <br>
more than 80% of humanity.  Mostly obsolete now. No human need be <br>
unnecessary in the absence of orders of magnitude<br>
superior AI.  Admittedly being an educated human helps.  I can't feel <br>
guilty for knowing more.  Besides, I'd be happy to share...<br>
<p>
Me:  I'm a she by the way.  I agree with most of your post.  Please <br>
explain to me how people will survive over the coming years when most of <br>
the economy has been automated.<br>
<p>
Hagbard Wrote:<br>
<p>
People are stockholders in corporations. As corporations do well, so <br>
do their stockholders. You're funny. You care about the people you are <br>
obsoleting? Stake your claim now, the moral high ground is disappearing <br>
fast! But you don't care that much, right? Or else, you wouldn't be doing <br>
it, would you? I think a social conscience is just that, a social <br>
conscience. It has zero praxis. Its easy to feel bad about "plights." What is <br>
your guilt accomplishing?<br>
<p>
Me:  Its accomplishing quite a bit! I think my guilt, to what degree I <br>
have any, is having the encourage to see these problems which many on <br>
this list are too afraid to acknowledge even exists (I hear Marie <br>
Antoinette again). <br>
 <br>
Hagbard: Again, the fact that you *DO* care about the majority of <br>
humanity is useless. <br>
<p>
Me:  You should be ashamed to call yourself Hagbard (after the <br>
Illuminatus! Character I presume).  The real Hagbard cared very deeply about <br>
the state of humanity.  Tell me, how is caring about ones fellow human <br>
beings useless?  My compassion has led me to several projects that have <br>
directly benefited people - including my stint with Habitat for Humanity <br>
and the Peace Corps. <br>
<p>
Hagbard: Free-market not needed by the people? What is your <br>
alternative? I mean there's pure communalism, pure capitalism and all the fuzzy <br>
gradations in between. Take your pick.<br>
<p>
Me:  If there is no third alternative then we are in big trouble!<br>
<p>
Hagbard:  Holly, you must have missed my earlier post (actually, this <br>
morning), on Godwin's Law of Nazi Apologies. What little credibility you <br>
might've had just went out the window in my eyes.<br>
<p>
Me: I just signed up on this list today, so I missed your post.  If <br>
you base a persons credibility on one post then you are very shallow <br>
person indeed.  <br>

Life has never been better.  Health has never been better.  The poor <br>

<p>
Me: See what you did, Marie Antoinette is going to be echoing in my <br>
head for days now!  Speak  for yourself - life has never ben better for  <br>
*you*.  I'd guess you live in the valley too!  The poor have never been <br>
as rich as they are today?  I refer you to QueenMuse:<br>

<p>
Please, I hate to enter into it with you, because I know who i am <br>
arguing with, but how can someone be poor AND rich at the same time?<br>
<p>
Me:  And on that note I bid you all goodnight.  I will login tomorrow <br>
if time allows.<br>
