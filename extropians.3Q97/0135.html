Yes, this is a tricky ethical problem. It is a special case of a more<br>
general problem that crops up in our discussions from time to time,<br>
that of the ethics of changing thinking beings. Is it ethical to<br>
modify the genes of an embryo, since we do not know if it will like<br>
the results? Is it ethical to modify the memes of a child through<br>
upbringing or schooling? These questions get tricky because the<br>
individual which is modified cannot give informed consent (the<br>
criminal might not want to stop being sociopathic, the embryo has no<br>
mind and the child might not understand the ramifications of<br>
education). <br>
<p>
One might argue that such changes "kill" or undo the future<br>
unmodified individual (this argument has been used against genetic<br>
modifications), but in that case education and upbringing are also<br>
destroying potential future personalities. One might disregard<br>
potential individuals completely, and just look at the likely<br>
results, trying to make them as good as possible (measured by one's<br>
moral standards). One might try to find a "value attractor" state: <br>
the future individual will likely agree that it was a good idea to be<br>
changed (but this is hard to achieve reliably). One might hide one's<br>
head in the sand and simply say modifications are unethical, but in<br>
that case we should not try to influence our children at all, which<br>
is clearly necessary for them to grow up into our culture (or into<br>
functioning adults). <br>
<p>
Tricky questions. <br>

<i>&gt; I have another series of bones to pick with the entire idea of </i><br>

<p>
Unfortunately I think you are right. <br>
<p>
I think the problem today is that we get too emotional about crimes. <br>
What is the (ideal) purpose of a system of laws and law enforcement? <br>
IMHO it is to make sure crimes (undesirable acts) doesn't happen too<br>
often and have small consequences. Today we are too much thinking in<br>
terms of justice and revenge; they are human ideas and emotions<br>
rather than objective facts.<br>
<p>
Perhaps it would be more efficient to put all the money spent on<br>
catching thieves into installing better locks. If somebody commits<br>
murder, the victim cannot be brought back but it is possible to make<br>
sure the murderer doesn't murder more people. <br>
<p>
How to implement something like this, and convince the vengeful<br>
primates about it is a non-trivial problem.<br>
