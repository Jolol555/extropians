: [...] and the populace is<br>
: "disenfranchised" - or "dis-empowered". Did you see the film Train Spotting?<br>
:  He complains: "the only thing worse than being a wanker is being conquered<br>
: by wankers".<br>
<p>
The line was:<br>
	"I don't hate the English: they're just wankers.<br>
	 But us, we're colonized by wankers!"<br>
<p>
(sorry I can't do my imitation Glasgow accent in this medium)<br>
<p>
:  But facts show:  we provide for people in need, we also rob them of their<br>
: dignity!! It is a humanitarian s nightmare.<br>
<p>
Shouldn't there be a "permanent" in there somewhere?<br>
Surely it's no insult to bring emergency supplies to victims of a fire.<br>
<p>
[later]<br>
: &gt;  What's "proper"?  "adequate"?<br>
:<br>
: Again, it is a perception. But it is up to the individual to decide,<br>
: not some golden mean you make up.<br>
<p>
That's a blank check - drawn on whose account?<br>
<p>
: I say it means a fairly comfortable<br>
: creature existence. Enough money to make ends meet.<br>
<p>
Circular ... To "make ends meet" is to live within one's means (I guess<br>
the metaphor means to make the end of the money reach to the end of the<br>
month).  How much that takes, depends on one's habits.<br>
<p>
(For me, it takes more than it "ought to", because of debts carelessly<br>
incurred years ago.)<br>
