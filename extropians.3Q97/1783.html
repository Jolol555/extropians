<i>&gt;* higher price for extro conference (I'd gladly pay) + some kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt;"scholarships" for people who are desired as attendees, even if they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;not necessarily speakers</i><br>
<p>
The multi-tiering of prices may be a necessary strategy once the conference<br>
is large enough to be <br>
self-sustaining. MAX: have you ever spoken to Glenn Tenney about how<br>
he/they run(s) Hackers?<br>
<p>
Regarding scholarships:<br>
There has to be some selection pressure or things will defocus/diffuse; and<br>
a selection<br>
committee (say) requires an investment of time from multiple parties.<br>
<p>
This brings up a separate point of possible interest should committees come<br>
into being:<br>
RECOMMENDATION: I find the practice of some (well, one that I know of) SF<br>
cons to require that<br>
all convention committee members still pay full price is a salutary curb on<br>
committee bloat.<br>
Not that that's a problem at this point, but it might be if Extro's<br>
membership grows much<br>
larger.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;* online list of attendees so you can prepare to have discussions in</i><br>
<i>&gt;advance</i><br>
<p>
That's a pretty good idea.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    What do you think? Any other ideas?</i><br>
<p>
Sure. <br>
<p>
Shorter, tight sessions. BTW, KUDOS to Max for scheduling/announcing<br>
'tween-session breaks--a practice I find infrequent in "Big" conventions of<br>
all stripes. Making the sessions tight is a skill that presenters need to<br>
focus on or it just doesn't happen, and it's not taught everywhere. Hmm,<br>
was that a pun?<br>
<p>
"Donut" (hole in the middle) sessions (the hole can be an intermission,<br>
mingle-session, teambuilding, a whole other session, _catered_ light lunch,<br>
or something you invent through lateral thinking--it's the jelly in the<br>
donut--the point being to transmute the flow without breaking it).<br>
Logistics need to be mirror-smooth if you put a session in the middle.<br>
IDEA: a la carte pricing for the "donut" session(s). There are obvious<br>
risks here.<br>
<p>
Sessions which are designed to turn into seminars. "Donut" sessions can do<br>
this spontaneously, sometimes even when not designed to. :) Information<br>
capture can be a problem here, depending on several obvious factors. More<br>
microphones can help if protocol is well observed.<br>
<p>
Sessions which require all participants (including the "audience") to hand<br>
in something written (questionnaire, topic-relevant provocative (po)<br>
utterance on a 3x5 card, single OVERHEAD page(!), ???) for admission. This<br>
requires arbitration and/or split attention from someone who thinks fast on<br>
his feet during the session. This can be total chaos or really great<br>
(productive) fun, depending--it's kind of a cross between a seminar and a<br>
just-in-time version of Luke's advance email discussion idea--when it<br>
works, it can be like a really great jam session, but there has to be a<br>
"chart" or a smooth rhythm section (:)) or it devolves. And it helps if you<br>
have chops *and* the ability to sit in with the rhythm section when you're<br>
not flying.<br>
<p>
And of course multitracking. There are obvious risks and costs, but it's<br>
traditional. This should be enough for us to view it with suspicion. :)<br>
