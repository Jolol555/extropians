He didn't get too mad, anyway it's good for my profile right ;-)<br>
I'd like to explore this further but using my work as a lab might result in<br>
termination of my employement ;-)<br>

problem<br>

<i> &gt;&gt; I agree with you for the most part but something is nagging me about all</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; this.</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; Maybe it just takes some getting use to ;-)</i><br>

<i> &gt;a free market solution is ideal, but so far I have found more problems</i><br>
<i> &gt;on the non-profit side than the market side. Perhaps there is a third</i><br>
<i> &gt;way?</i><br>
<p>
The typical Dutch awnser would be 'the middle road' try to combine the best<br>
of both in a mixed model of free market (for efficient allocation of<br>
resources) and some centralised control (I'll refrain from using the G-word<br>
here ;-) to make sure everybody can have acces to a high standard of<br>
medical care.<br>
I think the addition of the right to sell your organs/tissue's, like Lee<br>
Daniel Crocker &lt;lee@piclab.com&gt; suggests (before or after you die) could be<br>
some improvement. It remains trick though, I don't think we want people<br>
having babies for the sole purpose of selling the parts (young/fetal<br>
nervetissue could be very valuable for Parkinsons Disease patients).<br>
The push for animal/artificial solutions is a nicely clean, technical,<br>
problem compared to this.<br>
<p>
 Just another thought:<br>
 "There is nothing in the middle of the road<br>
  besides yellow stripes and dead armadillo's" (anyone know who said this?)<br>
