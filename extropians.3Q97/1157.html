Unclear. Do these things exist or not, what does "exist" even mean?<br>

That's just passing the buck, you arbitrarily decree that one is in physical <br>
reality and one is not, but the very thing we're discussing is what physical <br>
reality is and is not. When I sit in a chair I can't detect it directly, only <br>
through the agency of nerve impulses from my ass. I can't see bacteria <br>
directly, only through a magnifying lens. I can't detect the Virgo cluster <br>
directly, only through a light gathering lens, and even then not as it is now, <br>
only as it was 2 billion years ago. I can't detect The Mandelbrot Set <br>
directly, only through the  "lens" of a computer, but at least it shows me <br>
the set as it is now.<br>
    <br>
Actually that's not quite true, if you're very good at mental arithmetic you <br>
could detect the Mandelbrot Set unaided. If you're correct about reality then  <br>
something is unreal if it can be detected directly OR with the use of external <br>
assistance and real if it can ONLY be detected with an external assistance.<br>
This is the exact opposite of the spirit (I don't have a definition) of the <br>
word "real", at least as I use it.<br>
