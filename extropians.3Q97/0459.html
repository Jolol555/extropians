     <br>
     While I enjoyed the excerpt I read (Scott's wit is amazing), I purpose <br>
     that the mass process of "getting a clue" may not be so unreasonable.  <br>
     Yes, we're our culture is rather tweaked but compared to our our <br>
     ancestors of just a few hundred years ago, nevermind a millenium or so <br>
     ago, we are demonstrably less savage (explicitly anyway), there is <br>
     more agreement, more focused devotion to progress and many levels.  <br>
     <br>
     Now, while wanton hedonism and narcissism still have negative impacts <br>
     on our culture, I rather like the notion of the "1% for Peace" <br>
     movement.  At least they have the intention that a critical mass <br>
     paradigm shift that elevates consciousness could occur.  It's rather <br>
     dismaying to hear people talk about great technological leaps where <br>
     they don't even include the possibility that we may become responsible <br>
     stewards of our creations and new illumination.<br>
     <br>
     I'm going to peak at the new Fox show "Roar" not for it's <br>
     entertainment value but because I find it curious that a network has <br>
     decided that serialization of (an interpretation of) 5th century <br>
     Celtic culture is something of broadband interest.  There is something <br>
     archetypal and possibly significant here.  To me, it's not just a <br>
     commercial whim that millions of dollars get pumped into these media <br>
     memes ($90US million for "Contact"!) and fed en masse to us.  We are <br>
     creating agreement and we all know that enough agreement becomes <br>
     truth, maybe not absolute truth (whatever THAT is) but accepted truth. <br>
     <br>
     The bulk of this century has been an interesting segment in our <br>
     gestation period as a species.  Like a human fetus, all our brain <br>
     cells are being developed and connected as we become more <br>
     interconnected, awash in boundless amounts of information and the <br>
     invisible waves on which it increasingly travels.  <br>
     <br>
     Something's cooking and it smells good.<br>
