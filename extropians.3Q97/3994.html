<i>&gt;&gt; There are much less complex (however still not simple) ways to create</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; physical immortality without requiring any genetic alterations (to </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the original code).</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Just restore all the cells back to their original situation at the age </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of 25 years (assumed they already have passed the age of 25 years). </i><br>
<i>&gt;Less would be best, it's better 19 years or the high of sexual</i><br>
<i>&gt;performance (for men, for women I would have to think about it). BTW,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm 19, see the smile in my face?</i><br>
OK, whatever age you prefer. <br>
<p>
However the body is required to have stopped growing. Otherwise <br>
you will also have to alter tissue structures (i.e. you will have to <br>
add (and/or remove) cells). This makes everything even more<br>
complicated. <br>
<p>
The question if you're a full-grown human (for every body-part) I'll <br>
leave for you to decide.    :-&gt;<br>
<p>
                        <br>
<i>&gt; How to do this : use cell-repair-machines as described by the molecular</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotechnology concept. These machines should be able to repair all</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible molecular damage created by aging (or diseases), by deducting </i><br>
<i>&gt; the original structure from the damaged structure left.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Damaged DNA can be repaired by comparing the DNA of several different </i><br>
<i>&gt; neighboring cells. Crossbonds can be repaired if detected. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Damaged proteins can be repaired because the cell repair machines </i><br>
<i>&gt; will have the programmed knowledge to detect damaged proteins </i><br>
<i>&gt; and to restore the original proteins. Etc.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Okay, here's my problem: if you don't change the DNA, after 19/20 years</i><br>
<i>&gt;(assuming the repair process to be perfect) you would have to do all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;same thing again.</i><br>
Indeed, naturally this was a simplified visualization. In reality <br>
the repair of the cells will continue for ever, and you won't <br>
age at all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Wouldn't it be easier to change the DNA errors?</i><br>
NO!!!<br>
DNA errors? I thought your claim was "For extending the human life <br>
it is required to rewrite the DNA." ? <br>
i.e. not just correcting the errors, but designing a completely <br>
new DNA. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's also not going to be cheap but at least it lasts more than</i><br>
<i>&gt;nanotechnology repair.</i><br>
As I said before, in reality the repair process will continue for ever. <br>
Just like the (much less perfect) biological repair processes that go on <br>
in our cells.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Overall, I think that we don't know if any of these processes will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible at accessible prices. </i><br>
One of the basic principles of Molecular Nanotechnology (MNT) is (self) <br>
reproduction (just like in biology). Therefore the costs for MNT<br>
products <br>
(like cell-repair-machines) will be very cheap. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;gene therapy is here, I know genetic engineering is here, I know the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Human Genome project will be completed in the near future </i><br>
Ok, we have read out all genes, but that doesn't mean that we understand <br>
the program that is written in the genes. I can print out the bits (or <br>
bytes) of a computer program. Everybody can read the ones and zero's,<br>
even<br>
copy them. But do they understand what they are reading, do they<br>
understand <br>
what the program will do? NO!!!<br>
<p>
Before we can start rewriting the humane genome to render an immortal<br>
human <br>
being we will have to understand completely how the program of the genes <br>
is working. The fact that the programming in the genes is a kind of <br>
feedback system makes it even more complicated. I personally think it's <br>
likely that this will take even longer than creating MNT.<br>
<p>
Furthermore you will have to design new molecular machines (i.e.<br>
proteins, <br>
enzymes) to make the cells repair themselves perfectly. And program the <br>
instructions for making these machines in the DNA!<br>
<p>
Actually we're both presenting the same method to reach immortality. <br>
We're both assuming the cell will have to be repaired continuously. <br>
Only you're counting on designing new biological machines <br>
to do the repairing, using the programming language of the DNA.<br>
While I'm counting on designing completely new artificial machines <br>
(which are much more capable and also easier to design!).<br>
<p>
Why do I think artificial MNT cell-repair machines are more capable?<br>
Because you're not limited using biological materials. Because you <br>
can build a computer in the cell-repair machine to control it. <br>
(They can have a database, they can move in an coordinated manner, <br>
etc...) This all, is totally out of reach for conventional <br>
biological repair machines.<br>
<p>
Why do I think artificial MNT cell-repair machines are easier to<br>
design? Because you don't have to use DNA gene programming !!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;but I don't know nothing of present or reliable near future technologies </i><br>
<i>&gt;to do what you propose. </i><br>
I could make an argument just as weak as yours, and tell you that <br>
at this moment we can already move separate atoms. Now, what is <br>
only left to do, is to find out how to grab them and put them <br>
together. (In reality, of course, there's a bit more to it.)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Perhaps is ignorance of mine but I think that genetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;transformation is the most likely choice for the future of life</i><br>
<i>&gt;extension.</i><br>
Ignorance? Probably.... ;-&gt;<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Such a procedure of using cell repair machines should also be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; repair damage created by cryonic preservation. Remember, damage is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the same as destruction. Most (if not all) damage, created by cryonics, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that will render a cell biologically non-functional, can still be </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; repaired by cell-repair machines because the original structure </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; can still be DEDUCTED. I might add that cell repair machines will </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be easily able to do that, because they will be controlled by </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; computers (with dimensions of cubic micrometers).</i><br>
<i>&gt;where did you come up with the ideas that the original neurons will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;deducted and that cell repair machines will be able to do that? </i><br>
<p>
Actually I was referring to deduction of the original internal structure <br>
of a cell (a neuron in this case) from the damaged structures still <br>
present inside that cell. (I was talking about A cell, not tissues.)<br>
<p>
Almost al damage created by cryonic suspension still leaves the cell's <br>
in place. (Read the cryonics articles I've mentioned below.)<br>
<p>
However if the cell's are not in place, because the tissue was <br>
teared apart by cracking at low temperatures, even then, in most <br>
cases the original structure can still be deducted. Because the tissue <br>
was already frozen when the cracking occurred, the separate <br>
peace's will fit together. (i.e. see it like a jigsaw puzzle, if <br>
you scramble all the peace's, you're still able to restore the <br>
original structure.)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't know much of nanotechnology but, from what I know, I think </i><br>
<i>&gt;it has some interesting applications, including computers and </i><br>
<i>&gt;repair of cells, but from there to deduct, repair and/or rebuild a </i><br>
<i>&gt;neuron goes a long way.</i><br>
You, guessed it, I'm betting quite a lot on nanotech. However I'm <br>
still interested in other scientific fields.<br>
(And I also want to see an end to aging, just like you.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; read some information concerning molecular </i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotechnology, to start with the books "Engines of Creation" and </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Unbounding the Future", which are both available online! Many </i><br>
<i>&gt; articles written by Ralph C. Merkle should also prove interesting.</i><br>
It's important to understand Nanotech because then you will look at<br>
(especially biological) issues from a different perspective.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Probably, the only extropian area where I feel comfortable is life</i><br>
<i>&gt;extension.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'll try to find the books you recommend.</i><br>
 <br>

Have fun reading!!!<br>
<p>
If, after reading these, you still have arguments against cryonics <br>
and/or nanotech (MNT) I will be happy to see them posted on this list.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Natural selection, selects the genes that can produce the higher numbers</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;of the most fit offspring whereas fitness is defined as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;capacity to produce fit offspring.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Shouldn't that be:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Natural selection, selects the genes that can produce the highest</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; numbers PER UNIT OF TIME of most fit offspring .</i><br>
<i>&gt;Let's suppose 2 organisms with a reproduction cycle of 1 year, one of</i><br>
<i>&gt;them has an offspring of 100 in the first year and an offspring of 150</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the second year and then dies. The other organism has an offspring of</i><br>
<i>&gt;200 in the first year and then dies. </i><br>
For simplicity I was assuming a constant number of offspring per unit <br>
of time. (Not a varying one as in this last example.) And I also was <br>
assuming an equal period of time to reach the reproduction age.<br>
(Sorry, I should've added all these assumptions.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Indeed, the human brain is more complex than that of a frog (or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; mouse). But </i><br>
<i>&gt;Let me see, important, vital organs, the endocrine system is more</i><br>
<i>&gt;complex, presumably (I'm not sure) the immune system is more complex,</i><br>
<i>&gt;perhaps the digestive system and the circulatory system too and probably</i><br>
<i>&gt;others that my (very) limited knowledge of frog biology don't know.</i><br>
Yeah, OK. Actually I was having the comparison between a mouse and a<br>
human in mind. You're probably right about the frog-human comparison. <br>
Maybe it should be an amphibian-mammal comparison.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, like Geoff noticed, not only we are more complex but we are</i><br>
<i>&gt;different and it is this differences (is our circulatory, respiratory,</i><br>
<i>&gt;digestive system, etc) that might create incompatibilities between us</i><br>
<i>&gt;and the frog's antifreeze.</i><br>
That's a point.<br>
