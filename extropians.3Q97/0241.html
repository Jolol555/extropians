In a message dated 97-07-09 09:05:44 EDT, I said<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; Doesn't (mumble mumble)'s Law indicate that there has already been time<br>
<i>  &gt; enough for the entire galaxy to have been colonized?</i><br>
 <br>
and then you said<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Well, I've been trying to look into this, although I'm hampered by my lack</i><br>
     of expertise in astrophysics....... &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The (mumble Mumble)'s law is that of some guy who formulated an explanation<br>
for what you go on to describe...only trouble is i don't remember his<br>
name...I do recal that it was mentioned  by Sagan some years back...either in<br>
one of his non-fiction books or his TV series...likely booth.<br>
<p>
Anyway the law...or equation or whatever....factors in all kinds of<br>
things....Age of Universe...rate of expansion of colonization....average age<br>
of civilization...formation heavy elements from novas...hell I don't know<br>
what all....maybe even propensity towdard watching soap operas...it was a<br>
HAIRY equation....that I do remember.<br>
<p>
But to cut to the chase...the conclusion was that given a worst case<br>
analysis....we should have been visited quiet some time ago....many times<br>
over....hence ther term....Paradox.<br>
