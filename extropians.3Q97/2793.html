Nicholas Bostrom:<br>
Our discussion about the strategic situation after and during the<br>
development of nanotechnology has gone on for a while, and there is<br>
still disagreement on several [issues]. But perhaps we reached a near<br>
consensus on the following non-trivial points?<br>
===================================================<br>
<p>
1. Provided that technological research continues, nanotechnology will<br>
eventually be developed.<br>
<p>
CarlF:<br>
Agreed.<br>
<p>
Curt Adams:<br>
Molecular based self-replicators better than current bioforms will be<br>
developed: agreed.<br>
These forms will be machine phase: Not agreed (unproven, open question)<br>
<p>
Forrest:<br>
'Nanotechnology' is a suitcase word, much of current tech falls within the <br>
definition. I agree with Curt, with the extension that self-rep goo may also take<br>
on a 'mixed mode' (bio/mech++) form, or a form we have not even discussed yet.<br>
===================================================<br>
<p>
2. An immune system wouldn't work unless it was global.<br>
<p>
CarlF:<br>
Let's say that no large areas of the earth should be left unsupervised [by] an<br>
immune system.  No need to assume that only one immune system exists; I can<br>
easily imagine multiple, overlapping ones.<br>
<p>
Curt  Adams:<br>
Disagreed.  Mine works quite nicely.  Any immune system will be defeated at<br>
some point; if it's global then it's all over.  Successful nanodefense will<br>
rely on multiple local systems or it will fail.<br>
<p>
Forrest:<br>
Just so on both C's. Some of the black goo scenarios have devolved into <br>
fantasy, IMO.<br>
===================================================<br>
<p>
3. In the absence of a global immune system, if everybody could make<br>
their own nanotech machines then all life on earth would soon become<br>
extinct.<br>
<p>
CarlF:<br>
All human life, anyway.  Subterranean bacteria may hang on, if only because<br>
nobody bothers to try to exterminate them.  <br>
<p>
Curt  Adams:<br>
Current life: agreed.  Life as modified in the age of nanotech: disagreed.<br>
<p>
Forrest:<br>
I consider goo to be a lifeform in its own right. If 'everybody' makes their<br>
own new life (goo), the  result could just as easily be a New Cambrian <br>
Explosion. Calling goo a machine is correct, but insufficient. We are also <br>
machines, powered by quintillions of rotating motors.<br>
===================================================<br>
<p>
4. In the absence of ethical motives, the benefits would outweigh the<br>
costs for a nanotech power that chose to eliminate the competition or<br>
prevent it from arising, provided it had the ability to do so.<br>
<p>
CarlF:<br>
I utterly disagree.  .. I haven't been posting with my usual vigor, <br>
but my silence does not indicate<br>
that I have come to agree with you on this point!<br>
<p>
Curt  Adams:<br>
Two powers: agreed.  Multiple powers: disagreed.<br>
<p>
Hal Finney:<br>
Although several people have expressed disagreement with this, I think<br>
Nicholas has a point.<br>
In particular, the doctrine of comparative advantage doesn't seem<br>
relevant.  You aren't going to lose access to the resources represented<br>
by the competition; rather, you are going to subsume those resources<br>
and gain greater control over them.<br>
The only real objection I can see to this is that the takeover process will<br>
involve some destruction.  This could mean the permanent loss of useful<br>
information..<br>
<p>
Forrest:<br>
Strongly disagree. To Hal's point- you _do_ lose irreplaceable resources, <br>
namely the information stored in the patterns of atoms that made up your <br>
opponent.<br>
===================================================<br>
<p>
Hall Finney:<br>
It may be that a super-mind does find it convenient or necessary to give<br>
its sub-parts a certain amount of autonomy, similar to Minsky's model<br>
of our minds as a society of interacting subsystems.  There could still<br>
be disagreement or conflict among the parts as to the best division of<br>
resources, just as we in our own minds sometimes have trouble making<br>
choices between conflicting possibilities.<br>
<p>
Forrest:<br>
    I am not convinced that a Jupiter Brain style SI can retain a single identity<br>
over its extended structure. If its 'seat of consciousness' is distributed over<br>
a volume of space (perhaps in the interest of redundancy), a 'center' (C1) at one<br>
point will diverge by deltaC in time deltaT from a 'center' (C2) at another point. <br>
If the signal propagation delay (deltaT) is long enough, C2 might have evolved <br>
a will and outlook too different from C1's to be considered the same SI.<br>
    I think this effect make the development of a planet-wide, single identity <br>
SI very complicated, a Solar System-wide SI very unlikely, and a star-spanning <br>
SI impossible.<br>
<p>
