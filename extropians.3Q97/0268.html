GAUSSIAN HUMANS:<br>
  Neutral Terminology for the 21st Century.<br>
       )1997 by Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.<br>
<p>
Fairly soon, our society is going to be faced with altered humans.  Some<br>
naturally altered humans already exist.  Proposals for deliberately<br>
altering humans exist.  Now would be a good time to start defusing the<br>
panic that will result when the issue becomes popular.<br>
<p>
This article deals with the subject of what to call unaltered humans. <br>
I feel strongly that the term chosen should be neutral and should remain<br>
so, more for the altereds' sake than to spare the unaltereds'<br>
feelings.  While there's no need to deliberately promote a sense of<br>
class distinction that will retard research or spread fear, megalomania<br>
has always been the great cliche danger of mind-tampering.<br>
<p>
Bear in mind also, as you read this, that you are almost certainly an<br>
unaltered human; as you review the appellations, reject any you feel<br>
would be insulting if applied to you.  If you are, or plan to be, an<br>
altered human, reject any terms which make you feel megalomaniacal when<br>
used to refer to others.<br>
<p>
----<br>
<p>
Historically, terms used to denote unaltered humans include "normals",<br>
"mundanes", "ordinary humans", "humans"/"mere humans", "mortals", and so<br>
on.  I feel all of these are insulting.<br>
<p>
"Normals", as used on Babylon 5 and many novels, seems slightly<br>
derogatory; "mundane" is even worse.  In both cases the implication is<br>
that the person is flat/dull/obsolete.  Few people become famous or<br>
admired for being "normal" or "ordinary".  For that matter, how many<br>
"normal" people are there on this list?  Your chances of being "normal"<br>
aren't much better than your chance of being "modified".<br>
<p>
Calling unaltered humans "humans" is worse still; the implication is<br>
that the altered are a new species.  Taxonomically, and ethically, this<br>
will not be the case.  Human/nonhuman distinctions should be reserved<br>
for human-computer distinctions, or humans who have been neurally<br>
reprogrammed to the point that they have entirely different cognitive<br>
architectures and are essentially neurally based computers.<br>
<p>
"Mortals" is worse still.  Mortal/nonmortal distinctions should be<br>
reserved for {humans, AIs} vs. {Vingean Powers, Singularity Children}. <br>
Using the term to refer to others, if meant seriously, is a short step<br>
from megalomania.  There may be some slight justification for medical<br>
immortals using this term, but even these long-lived folk could fall<br>
prey to a nova and are thus mortal.<br>
<p>
----<br>
<p>
I therefore propose the phrase "Gaussian", as in "Gaussian<br>
distribution", also known as a bell curve.  A Gaussian can be anywhere<br>
on the curve.  A Gaussian can be an idiot or a genius or an average<br>
fellow.  No geis of normality or uninterestingness is implied.<br>
<p>
The implication is that the person is a legitimate part of that curve,<br>
which an altered human is not.  Let's say we implant 1,000 people with<br>
neural interfaces to pocket calculators.  If we now look at the total<br>
bell curve for all human calculating ability, we'll find an ordinary<br>
looking curve with a huge spike way off on the right.  Moreover, the<br>
curve and the spike will have been produced by entirely different<br>
internal models, one natural, the other artificial.<br>
<p>
Of course, that's a best-case scenario (for the altered humans).  Other<br>
alterations (such as those I've proposed in "Algernon's Law") would<br>
produce somewhat odder disturbances in the bell curve.  In addition to<br>
spikes on the right, there'd be spikes on the left, flat areas in the<br>
middle, broken correspondences, and all sorts of statistical havoc.  I<br>
daresay that cognitive scientists of the future will have to exclude<br>
altered humans from the sample of any study not specifically geared to<br>
them.<br>
<p>
Which is the general idea.  You have Gaussian humans, who tend to be<br>
distributed smoothly and statistically, with most in the middle and a<br>
few on the edges.  Then there are altered humans, whose curves come in<br>
all sorts of odd shapes and sizes - not necessarily with any net trend<br>
towards the right.  (In other words, the altered will be weird but not<br>
necessarily superior.)<br>
<p>
(Picky readers may note that many altereds' curves will be Gaussian in<br>
their own right; however, the mean will probably be different, which<br>
would distort the unaltereds' curve if factored in.  And since an<br>
altered human is likely to be the product of a single disturbance<br>
rather than a large set of environmental and genetic variations, the<br>
curves *are* less likely to be Gaussian.)<br>
<p>
Finally, the phrase "Gaussian" has never been used in any science<br>
fiction novel (that I am aware of) to refer to a group of humans.  It<br>
will therefore have only whatever connotations we choose to give it, and<br>
will initially evoke no prejudices.<br>
<p>
Do any of you deem this phrase insulting?<br>
Would it make you feel megalomaniacal if you used it to refer to others?<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.<br>
