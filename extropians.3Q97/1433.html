Apparently you missed the aerobot thread. There are now few-10 g<br>
semiautonomous microremotes in development (quite recently there has been<br>
a conference on them -- military recog missions (even within buildings)<br>
and antipersonnel being obvious applications). According to web lore<br>
(truly fascinating, btw) a number of hobbyists are building quite powerful<br>
jet turbines from simple ICE turboloaders, a recent article has shown that<br>
gas turbines scale down very well, predicting quite ridiculous weight/lift<br>
ratios. Using lithography on SOS (silicon on sapphire) wafers, I guess an<br>
array of microturbines cum according fuel lines/pumps and steering logic<br>
can be built. Unidentified flying wafers, so to speak. Inertial guidance,<br>
CCD and GPS are more than sufficient for navigation. <br>
<p>

<p>
Molecular system autotreplication by means of machine-phase chemistry <br>
might well be impossible. Don't hold your breath yet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; processors be small/powerful enough? What effect, if any, does the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Beckenstein bound have on this?</i><br>
<p>
None. Bekenstein bound predicts the upper achievable limits of computation<br>
a given material system is capable of. Which are ridiculously high. Real<br>
systems only survive tiny amounts/velocities of bit tweaking before<br>
turning into plasma. A recent article I've read predicts several TBit<br>
storage (currently 4 GBit, NEC). Professor Hartnagel's QM devices (100x100<br>
quantum well array on few nm^2) could lead to 10^4 bit/1 um^2 storage<br>
density in 10/15 years. This is the end of the line for flat circuits at<br>
RT (but this still a lot higher than I expected). Above processes are <br>
implementable in diverse III-V, and plain SiGe. Ebeam and AFM litho as <br>
well as heavy ion track etching are being proposed.<br>
