     Sarrah Marr wrote in response to Tony Hollick's rant:<br>
     <br>
     To most people, and most dictionaries, 'sexual' means 'of or <br>
     concerning sex'. And sex does not mean making babies. I find it hard <br>
     to agree that heterosexual people having penetrative intercourse <br>
     without a condom are engaging in sexual activity, whilst those having <br>
     penetrative sex with a condom are not. "Making babies" is a subset of <br>
     sex, not vice-versa.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     A practical and sober response Sarah.  I'm of the mind that in this <br>
     particular instance, any other attempts to reason in this arena would <br>
     be like beating one's head against a brick wall &lt;G&gt;.<br>
     <br>
     I asked my partner about this whole teacher-lover-mother situation <br>
     with Mary Kay whoever.  He was actively pursued by a father figure man <br>
     when he was 13 and they had an affair.  It went on for the summer.  It <br>
     ended up being a big public court mess of course when the parents <br>
     found out.  The guy was in his late 20s and had used guilt and other <br>
     adult-honed forms of manipulation to make his boy-lover more mailable. <br>
     <br>
     Regardless of the information-richness of our society, the exceptions <br>
     we may deem appropriate or inappropriate in the realm of love/sex, <br>
     this woman was the boy's teacher, she was entrusted in a relationship <br>
     of propriety.  The boy would only naturally follow his impulses (like <br>
     boys his age will whether it's an unrequited crush or having one's <br>
     first hump or blow job in some private stolen moment).  I regard the <br>
     teacher (as does my partner) as an emotional child.  She has <br>
     sacrificed a great deal because of a howling error in judgment.  While <br>
     there may be volumes of extenuating circumstances Mr. Hollick can <br>
     dredge up to garner sympathy for the woman, fact of the matter is <br>
     doing what she did in our culture is no more appropriate than when <br>
     Ethiopian immigrants try to continue the tradition of female <br>
     "circumcision" in this country and think it's not a crime.  We as a <br>
     culture have deemed it so.  <br>
     <br>
     Until such time where children are somehow imbued with experience, <br>
     wisdom and discernment, they are not appropriate sexual partners for <br>
     adults.  The chasm is too wide (although considering the lame-brained <br>
     folly of Mary Kay, maybe they were closer, emotional maturity-wise, <br>
     than one may think! &lt;G&gt;).<br>
     <br>
