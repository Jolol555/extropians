Also, shipbuilding was pretty well advanced in the Eastern Mediterranean<br>
by then, and (as far as I remember) there was active marine trade between<br>
Crete and Egypt during the height of Minoan civilization.<br>
<p>
It makes sense that Plato and Solon would have heard this story from the<br>
Egyptians, too, and not from their own ancestors, since their own ancestors<br>
were of the illiterates who finished off what was left of Minoan civilization<br>
after Thera. As far as I'm concerned, civilization means a society that is<br>
capable of producing and preserving literature, not just urban society.<br>
That's why Sumer and Egypt are conventionally listed as the "first<br>
civilizations", even though Neolithic urbanization in Palestine and <br>
Anatolia precedes Sumerian and Egyptian urbanization. The Sumerians and<br>
the Egyptians learned to write before the Anatolians and Palestinians<br>
did.<br>
<p>
(I'm using "literature" in the widest possible sense, a sense that would<br>
include modern cinematic works and physics textbooks, for instance.)<br>
