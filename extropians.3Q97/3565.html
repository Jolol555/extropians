Quite so, Chris. I've had a couple of experiences of this in Europe lately.<br>
I just got back from Austria where I spoke at a seminar and was slandered<br>
from the audience by Geert Lovink, an "activist" left, and self-avowed<br>
nihilist (his own presentation was illustrated by numerous photos of broken<br>
and decaying objects -- he was practically a Randian villain stereotype!).<br>
This fellow, during the question period of my talk, got up and referred to<br>
extropians as a cult. I pointed out to the audience how this was a great<br>
way of trying to prevent people from rationally considering a point of<br>
view. He actually started his question by saying something like "It would<br>
be easy for me to suggest that you are a Social Darwinist, but I won't." So<br>
he smeared me in a sneaky way. I was pleased that a number of people<br>
afterwards showed they were wise to his ways.<br>
<p>
I was also called a fascist when speaking in Germany for daring to suggest<br>
that we use technology to continually improve ourselves!<br>
<p>
I had given absolutely no cause for such an attribute, and of course we<br>
extropians have nothing remotely like a cult. Chris is exactly right that<br>
the misperception is hardly our fault. I do think we should give increased<br>
awareness to how we present our ideas. But I give zero credit to those who<br>
use terms like "social Darwinist", "Nazi", or "fascist."<br>
