: Poor Jim Legg.<br>
<p>
Poor, poor pitiful Jim.<br>
<p>
: He and his buddies (and perhaps some of his tentacles too?)<br>
<p>
And is Ingrid a buddy or a tentacle?<br>
<p>
: rudely conspire to barrage the extropians list with their<br>
: little meme-bombs,<br>
<p>
It's for your own good!<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
: reacted by squawking about "police" and being repressed,<br>
: censored, etc. (when in fact, you have been merely rerouted around),<br>
	[...]<br>
<p>
"rerouted around" sounds as if a public highway has been deliberately<br>
planned to keep him from going shopping.  Say rather that the (latest)<br>
Neo-Jargon gang have inspired others to ignore them ... and those<br>
coordinating the effort to ignore them have as much right to be<br>
heard on this list as the ignorees have.<br>
<p>
But I gather Legg has gone off in a huff already.  Maybe<br>
he'll spread a rumor that Extropians are shut-mind wankers.<br>
Let's just hope he tells it to enough of HIS friends.<br>
<p>
(Has FM told about the offensive man in Luxemburg, yet?)<br>
<p>
I ask myself whether these guys would get a better reception if they<br>
adopted a style more like (oh, let's pick an example at random) mine:<br>
no long eye-glazing general expositions, just concise illustrations<br>
of how the general theory applies to the matter under discussion,<br>
with occasionally an exposition of a few paragraphs.  (And then I<br>
ask myself whether I'm just rationalizing because I'm too lazy<br>
and/or scatterbrained to write long general expositions, and/or<br>
too empty-headed to have anything to expound.)<br>
