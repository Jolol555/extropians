John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt;,<br>
<p>
	We're starting to repeat ourselves.  It is my feeling that you<br>
are still entirely missing the point I am trying to make as indicated<br>
here:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You can't use your consciousness theory because that's what you're</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to test and the only feeling I can objectively observe is my</i><br>
<i>&gt; own, so how could I ever objectively prove you're conscious?</i><br>
<p>
	"the only feelings I can objectively observe is my own" is<br>
precisely the point.  We will so thoroughly understand the laws of<br>
physical consciousness and how they correspond and predict what WE<br>
feel as we observe, manipulate and stimulate our own brain that there<br>
will be no other possibility but that others with similar neural<br>
correlates are experiencing similar sensations.<br>
<p>
	Also, just as our brain integrates many sense representations<br>
into one single conscious world, eventually we'll be able to integrate<br>
multiple conscious brains into single conscious worlds.  Just like we<br>
know in our own minds that a red sensation is not anything like a<br>
salty sensation, or just like we know that red produced by one eye is<br>
the same as red produced by the other eye, we will be able to design<br>
ways to experience, first hand, what other minds are experiencing.<br>
<p>
	These are only two possible techniques to accomplish what you,<br>
for some unknown reason, apparently claim will be forever impossible.<br>
I'm sure if one is creative enough one can think of many other ways to<br>
do this kind of stuff.  Once we understand how to manipulate,<br>
engineer, improve, and upload minds and all that, all this kind of<br>
understanding and proof must come to pass just like we know that the<br>
earth is not the center of the universe because we are finally dancing<br>
around in our heliocentric solar system and beyond.<br>
