Mark Grant:<br>
<i>&gt;As I said, most people who hold this belief seem caught up in the myth of</i><br>
<i>&gt;"childhood innocence". </i><br>
<p>
I don't make statements of belief on this list, and I never trade in <br>
myth.  My post was based on the basic textbook theory found in the <br>
fields of childhood psychology, early socialization theory, and group <br>
dynamics.  The literature in these fields gives short shrift to the <br>
subjective concept of "innocence".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You seem to be under the impression that kids are</i><br>
<i>&gt;somehow rational, civilised people with whom you can "negotiate</i><br>
<i>&gt;disputes", and ignore the rather obvious fact that most kids are far more</i><br>
<i>&gt;vicious and irrational than most adults. </i><br>
<p>
Again, I am sorry for your bad experiences as a child, and I think <br>
that most of us can share the same type of story.  I do not, however, <br>
equate that experience with general childhood disputes.  The learning<br>
of basic negotiation skills is a vital component to any child's <br>
development, to the extent that most childhood development books will <br>
devote at least a chapter to it.  As for your 'obvious fact' above, I <br>
would ask that you provide some definite support for that statement, <br>
outside of your personal experience, in order to consider it a <br>
general truism.  <br>
