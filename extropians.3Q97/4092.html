Thank you Amara and Forrest for responding with such full-bodied facts and<br>
information from both sides of the issue. My head is still spinning from<br>
your immediate and excellent handiwork.  It is really amazing that the<br>
Cassini dispute has gone this far.  My mind keeps pulling up a scene from<br>
"Contact" where the fanatics are flag-waving their "cause."  I'm very<br>
concerned about this mission and what will happen not only with Cassini, but<br>
future missions.  If the adversaries are inaccurate in their facts and their<br>
holler is inauthentic -- and it doesn't now get dealt with now, I think<br>
about consequences of such interference with future missions.  Especially<br>
since the theme of space has come full circle (so to speak) and the<br>
enthusiasm that we once enjoyed in the 1970s has returned anew.<br>
