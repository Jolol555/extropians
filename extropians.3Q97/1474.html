I think the best approach would be something 'ala Atlas Shrugged, where <br>
important people disappear, one by one. Somehow, one of them slips and<br>
reveals their influence in the real world. They are of course, being<br>
uploaded.<br>
One of the uploads could be someone who is somehow strategically important<br>
to something, be it a military, scientific or what have you situation, and<br>
is the<br>
McGuffin for the hero. At the end, the hero saves the world somehow,<br>
without<br>
betraying the uploads or letting the rest of the world know what has<br>
happened. At <br>
the very end, a newscast plays out, telling the world that the now-famous<br>
hero has disappeared mysteriously...<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; I've been trying to do the exact same thing.  The problems I find</i><br>
are:<br>
<i>&gt; trying</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; to be optimistic and still hold the attention of todays audience</i><br>
(who<br>
<i>&gt; have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; been made to believe genetic engineering will create mosters and</i><br>
AI's<br>
<i>&gt; will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; eat their children) and trying to present highly complex, world</i><br>
changing<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; technologies in a way the audience would understand. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Exactly. Tonight the Lawnmover Man will air on swedish television. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  like the film, it contains several transhuman themes and the graphics</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  from Xaos Inc was brilliant when it was made. Still, to tell the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  story the movie *needs* something gone wrong (at least they did not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  use the silly Star Trek idea that superintelligence always leads to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  amoralit - the nasty men in suits wrecked the whole experiment).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Try to avoid The Lawnmower Man 2, they decided to go down the route of</i><br>
"VR's<br>
<i>&gt; now so good it looks just like real life" and the whole film consists of</i><br>
kids<br>
<i>&gt; pretending to fly in front of a blue screen.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Maybe one way of getting tension into a basically transhuman movie</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  may be to have a conflict between two reasonable points of view,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  instead of "good guys vs. villains", like (say) transhumanists</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  wishing to expand human potential and bring life to the universe, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  environmentalists who want to heal the world and live in harmony with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  nauture (the movie could end with the transhumans moving off-planet</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  as "Children of the Sun", leaving it for the "Children of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Earth"), but I think most companies would prefer the tried and tested</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  black vs. white theme. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The best way to get a point across is to ignore black and white, and go</i><br>
for a<br>
<i>&gt; nice fuzzy grey.  Several themes have crossed my mind:  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1.  A rebellion against all these 'American President saves the world'</i><br>
<i>&gt; movies.  Instead have a time travelling assassin download himself into</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone's body with the mission of killing the president because of his</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposition to anarchy.  This could lead to a great opportunity of showing</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; government through the eyes of someone who's seen better.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2.  Have a couple of people thaw out of cryonic suspension and go on to</i><br>
<i>&gt; explore the wonderful possibilities of the posthuman world.  Keep the</i><br>
<i>&gt; audience in awe of the possibilities and they might not notice the lack</i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt; good vs. evil.  And then, just when they think it's all over interrupt</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; credits with scientific news on actually progress towards these</i><br>
possibilities<br>
<i>&gt; (You could also throw in a natural disaster, get them all working towards</i><br>
a<br>
<i>&gt; goal).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Another way of showing transhuman themes in an interesting way is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  look at their human consequences. What about a movie about a family</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  where a daughter is uploaded after an accident, something like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  typical movie where the daughter is handicapped and people struggle</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  to adapt and understand the situation? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not exactly the kind of groundbreaking film to alter the perception of</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; world though (which I think is what we're aiming for here).</i><br>
