<i>&gt; Nicholas Bostrom, &lt;bostrom@mail.ndirect.co.uk&gt;, writes:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Apart from the staggering ontological implications, there is one </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; objection that many philosophers of physics consider fatal: The </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Everett theory fails to make sense of the probabilities. For </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; instance, take a particle that can undergo either of two processes, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and say that according to quantum mechanics the first event (A) has </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; an 80% chance of occuring, and the second (B) 20%. Now, according to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the Everett interpretation what happens (basically)  is that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; universe splits into two universes; and there is one copy of me in </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; each of these universes. But if this were the case, then there should </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be a 50% chance for me (i.e. *this* copy of Nicholas Bostrom)  to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; find that A had happened and a 50% chance that B had happened; which </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; we know from experiment is not true.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I don't know of any good reply to this objection that would save the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Everett interpretation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, Everett spent considerable effort in his original paper to</i><br>
<i>&gt; address this issue.  (Later authors have muddied the waters, though,</i><br>
<i>&gt; particularly DeWitt's claim that the probabilities follow from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; formalism itself, which no one takes seriously today.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The idea is that as the state function evolves into a mixture of</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-coherent states, a measure function can be applied to the various</i><br>
<i>&gt; components of the mixture, based on the probability amplitudes.  Everett</i><br>
<i>&gt; shows that, in the limit, the probability results observed from a series</i><br>
<i>&gt; of measurements will match the squared-amplitude of the relative state,</i><br>
<i>&gt; exactly as required by conventional QM; this is true except in a set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; branches of total measure zero.  So you then only have to assume that</i><br>
<i>&gt; branches with amplitude zero never exist, and you derive that observed</i><br>
<i>&gt; probabilities will follow the predictions of conventional QM.  (This is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the basis for DeWitt's claim, since he takes the premise as obvious.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Other authors have suggested that this solution is not quite enough, since</i><br>
<i>&gt; it only applies in the limit of an infinite series of measurements.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggest that a more powerful assumption is needed, namely that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; measure of a branch, defined as amplitude-squared, determines the subjective</i><br>
<i>&gt; likelihood of a conscious observer finding himself in the branch.</i><br>
<p>
Yes this is what they say. The problem is that the measure doesn't <br>
seem to correctly represent probabilities, if the world is as the <br>
Everett interpretation says it is. If there is exactly one version of <br>
me in a world where I measure Spin up, say, and exactly one version <br>
of me in a world where I measure Spin down (and no other versions of <br>
me, in this simplified example), then why is it that *this* <br>
version of me usually ends up being the version of me that obtains <br>
the outcome that quantum mechanics says is the most probable one? <br>
Imagine that at each point of time t we define the set Ct as <br>
containing all time slices of minds that exist at t. Then, as time <br>
goes by, the proportion of mind slices in Ct that would see quantum <br>
mechanical predictions verified experimentally would quickly become <br>
completely negligable; and yet, miraculously,  it constantly turns <br>
out that I am in Ct! The improbabiliy that this should happen is the <br>
improbability that the Everett interpretation is true, if there is no <br>
way to escape this conclusion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (You might think of this as indicating that the "degree of reality" of</i><br>
<i>&gt; a branch is proportional to the square of the amplitude.)</i><br>
<p>
But then I want the follower of Everett to explain to me what a <br>
degree of reality is, and more particularly why there is a greater <br>
probability that I should find myself in the world with the higher <br>
"degree of reality", when there are two real worlds and there is one <br>
version of me in one of them and one in the other.<br>
<p>
If sense cannot be made of "degrees of reality" (I'm not convinced it <br>
can't, but it's a very deep issue) then, it has been proposed, <br>
perhaps we should say that there are a greater *number* of worlds <br>
associated with more probable outcomes. This would solve the problem <br>
of probabilities, but now look at the ontology you have bought into. <br>
You have commited yourself to an *uncountable infinity* of worlds <br>
existing side by side, many of them identical! (Is it even meaningful <br>
to postulate two distinct worlds that are *exactly* similar.) All <br>
simplicity and plausibility seem to have been lost at this stage.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The bigger problem with the conventional interpretation IMO is that it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; inconsistent; the two different processes produce different results, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is not clear exactly when we should use one or the other.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure exactly what you referes to as the "conventional <br>
interpretation". Personally, I (also?) am unhappy with  <br>
interpretations that appeal to the notion of measurement at a <br>
fundamental level. But we must not forget the possibility that <br>
something like the GRW interpretation turns out to be correct, so it <br>
would be all too hasty to jump to something really weird, especially <br>
if it doesn't even work.<br>
