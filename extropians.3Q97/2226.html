<p>
Alcor provides a Bracelet or Pendant (you choose) and a wallet card. I<br>
have augmented this with a money sized bright red folder saying "READ IN<br>
EMERGENCY" with a fold out sheet inside detailing several scenarios from<br>
death to mere arrest to be followed by whoever sees it.<br>
<p>
About 80% of deaths are anticipated, and such patients do usually become<br>
suspended. I don't have stats for the other situations. EMTs will follow<br>
instructions provided 1) they are aware of them 2) said instructions do<br>
not interfere with the EMT procedures and life saving mandates.<br>

SF Bay Area has many cryonicists, and IMHO is also a reasonable place.<br>

<i>&gt; The the development of a (there you have it!) *deathwatch*. You know, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; device that's been discussed here before (or was it on CryoNet?)</i><br>
<p>
Cryonet, about a year ago. <br>
<p>
I've looked into this quite a lot. Basically the technology for this<br>
will appear in about 2 years as part of the medical monitoring/telemetry<br>
market which is currently the focus of a lot of R&amp;D. The cryo folk are<br>
such a minute market it is senseless to try commercial development<br>
directly. I had lunch with a CEO of a wireless company at Extro-3, his<br>
estimate of development costs was about $250K and 1-2 years. I agree.<br>
<p>
Yes, it could be done as a labor of love, but the result would be kludgy<br>
and requires the full dedication of someone indefinitely. Developing the<br>
right sensor technology is a non-trivial problem!!!<br>
<p>
Those seriously interested please email me and I will send you some<br>
memos I wrote last year on this topic.<br>

<i>&gt; It could be</i><br>

<p>
It happened already, two years ago. 6 days in summer heat made the brain<br>
total soup, poured down the drain....<br>
<p>
&lt;list of features&gt;<br>
<p>
Yah. Let alone the silent "I'm being mugged" alert. Making it reliable,<br>
ie few undetected situations and NO false alarms is a serious challenge.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Getting rich, safe *and* better preserved...what more could you possibly</i><br>
<i>&gt; want</i><br>
<i>&gt; (ok, a lot).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
So, are you signed up??<br>
