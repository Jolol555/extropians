<p>
Presuming the Big Bang is true, the mass of the Universe is around 10^80<br>
protons. This limits the largest Preal string to 10^80 characters or so,<br>
certainly less than 10^100, the googol. Forget the virtual particles, I<br>
am just suggesting a number which is large, fits in the Universe and<br>
very very definitely NOT infinite.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyway, I don't know if there's a genuine upper bound on the amount of</i><br>
<i>&gt; information the Universe can store.  Unless the Universe is quantized, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; amount is equal to - at least - aleph-2.  (All those fields of real</i><br>
<i>&gt; numbers...)  Even supposing the Bekenstein Bound - what about all the digits</i><br>
<i>&gt; of pi?  Even excluding "Platonic" information, what about virtual particles</i><br>
<i>&gt; and negative matter?  Would there still be some physical bound on the number</i><br>
<i>&gt; of positive and negative "particles"?  I sure don't know.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Ok, to get really gritty - the maximum amount of bits storable if you<br>
converted the entire universe into data storage using nanotechnology. 1<br>
bit<br>
per proton.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And - out of curiosity - there can't possible be a sharp distinction between</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Preal" things and "Punreal" things.</i><br>
Prove this. There are many infinite objects, all of which are Punreal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even if there is a sharp physical</i><br>
<i>&gt; bound... wouldn't it be essentially arbitrary in some way?</i><br>
<p>
Yes it is arbitrary. My real interest is in the limits of what is<br>
physically representable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I cannot see any</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason why there would be a limit on how much information can be "real".  At</i><br>
<i>&gt; worst, we might be ontologically restricted to some low number or ordinal of</i><br>
<i>&gt; aleph-infinity.</i><br>
<p>
A googol will do just fine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So if Preal and Punreal don't describe any testable or</i><br>
<i>&gt; fundamental quality of a string... what's the point?</i><br>
<p>
If length(string) &gt; googol, string = Punreal<br>
<p>
I think that is testable.<br>
