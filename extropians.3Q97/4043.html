If it's so clear, please explain to those of us who are ignorant<br>
in such matters what "day" means in the original Hebrew and in<br>
the other references to that word in the Bible.  Some scholars<br>
say that some terms in the Bible are symbolic or metaphors, so<br>
explain why this incorrect, since it should be clear.<br>
