<p>
 The advantages of such contracts are obvious enough to academics that<br>
you wouldn't accomplish a lot by making a big project out of this -<br>
unless you try to spread this idea to the medical profession. I suspect<br>
you are more suited to swaying academics than hospital managers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2) "Explaining Product Bans" (<a href="http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/whyban.ps">http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/whyban.ps</a>)</i><br>
<p>
 If you can succeed turning this into a sufficiently convincing<br>
argument that you sway a significant number of academics, then you<br>
would certainly accomplish much more with this project than with<br>
the others, both in terms of promoting freedom and your reputation.<br>
But I'm not convinced you have the beginnings of a powerfull argument<br>
here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3) "Why Do We Disagree?" (<a href="http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/calibration.ps">http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/calibration.ps</a>)</i><br>
<p>
 Probably the safest of the 3 projects. You would probably turn this into<br>
a convincing argument. However, it isn't clear that that would accomplish<br>
a lot.<br>

 I find it hard to understand why people would be more afraid of this<br>
when the life insurance is $100,000 than they are with the current life<br>
insurance level of $0.<br>
 Most people seem to have some awareness that HMOs are currently making<br>
this kind of tradeoff.<br>
