This is going to be a buzzword used to milk New Age suckers of their money.<br>
 "Eiditic" is really a type of memory - a perfect memory of all sensory<br>
information, kind of an upgrade from photographic.  Pretty much only children<br>
have it - they lose it by adulthood.  Actually it's not perfect, although<br>
that's its reputation; just very good.<br>

Absolutely nothing will get you to Pluto (which is 8 light-hours away) in 9<br>
minutes.  They have anitmatter in the lab, yes, but as individual atoms,<br>
which is about 10e26th of what you need for a drive.  Don't buy any tickets<br>
yet.<br>
