<i>&gt; &gt; cosmological disaster ("But your immune system can't stand a supernova!").</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This exercise is trying to look at defenses against gray goo, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is the real problem, not macro-level warfare.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But you *do* need an invulnerable system, or at least one that is invulnerable</i><br>
<i>&gt; to goo.  I can reasonably invoke any forces modern technology is capable of</i><br>

<i>&gt; defenses are!  I am darn well entitled to demand that your immune system stand</i><br>
<i>&gt; up against nuclear weapons, because in practice, that's what going to be used!</i><br>
<p>
That's right.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not impossible.  Not at all impossible.  If you have a layered defense system,</i><br>
<i>&gt; a diamond shell, and Fog seat belts, the city might be perfectly capable of</i><br>
<i>&gt; withstanding a nuclear attack.  It would lose a layer of defense, but might</i><br>
<i>&gt; well be capable of rebuilding it before more black goo crossed the radioactive</i><br>
<i>&gt; zone.  In addition, as I pointed out, the city might gain more than it lost.</i><br>
<p>
Does this mean that yoo are no longer confident in you "destruction <br>
by induction" argument?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even so, it's entirely possible that, on any planet, the black goo wins.  All</i><br>
<i>&gt; the time.  Every time.  The Universe is under no obligation to make things</i><br>
<i>&gt; easy for us.  Hence the proposed Directive of Evacuation:  "Get everyone off</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Earth, into partitioned space colonies, before releasing nanotechnology to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world."</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it is remarable how many people are stuck with the idea that an <br>
effective defense *must* be possible. That's blind faith. And even if <br>
effective defense is possible, there is still the genesis problem; <br>
but by another leap of faith, that problem *must* be soluble too, <br>
even within an unregulated mulipolar world order. I suspect there is <br>
some ideological prejudice at the bottom of this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My mental picture of these conflicts is partially drawn from Conway's Game of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Life, in which a single particle can destroy an enormous, complex structure. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Things on the molecular level will almost certainly be different.  Even so, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; know of no better image.</i><br>
<p>
An interesting way of looking at it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Try this tactic.  First, the goo hits the city with a vaporize-one-layer</i><br>
<i>&gt; attack, even though this also vaporizes a layer of goo.  Then it detonates a</i><br>
<i>&gt; nuclear weapon next to the city.  This pushes the city into the goo,</i><br>
<p>
Do you literally mean "push"? That would seem like fantasy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The gray goo problem is overrated; it's black goo we need to worry about.</i><br>
<p>
I agree. As I think is clear from my postings, goo designed to <br>
destruct is what I meant by grey goo, but from now on I will call it <br>
black goo.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; You assume that the destroyed cell will no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; longer be a problem. But what if it turned into a cube of inert diamondoid?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Then it would also be a hinder, and give me even more time to develop</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; countermeasures.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If it is inert diamondoid, is that more of a hindrance than the outer shell?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Besides, this whole discussion is looking obsolete anyway.  Any rigid outer</i><br>
<i>&gt; defense is toast.  It has to be surrounded by explosive-equipped soft 'mune. </i><br>
<i>&gt; At most, you can have a rigid outer defense as a pretty shell.</i><br>
<p>
I agree.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Note that they would be produced faster than the goo since the goo would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have to both reproduce, breach security and defend itself while the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; antibodies and macrophages would just be produced (although a goo-like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; macrophage is an interesting and dangerous concept) and sent on their way.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;if the goo has so much as a cubic millimeter to</i><br>
<i>&gt; call its own, it can keep its queen reproducers in the center while</i><br>
<i>&gt; surrounding itself with warrior goo, just like the city.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why can't the goo use antibodies and macrophages against the 'mune?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The tactical symmetry remains unbroken.</i><br>
<p>
Soo it seems.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;  The goo simply makes repeated</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; attacks, and each time, the city shrinks a little.  We won't even speak of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; such horrors as cutting off that city's solar power.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; An isolated immune system in a world where nobody else has immune systems</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is weaker than a system in a world where nanodefenses are common. The ultimate</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; defense would of course be to have immune systems everywhere, defending</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not just the transhumans but the himalayas, squirrels and grass. A bit like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the current state in biology, really.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If nanotechnology was released on Earth, the 'munes would have to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; EVERYWHERE.  The air.  The water.  Earth's molten core.  Otherwise, the goo</i><br>
<i>&gt; could gain a foothold.</i><br>
<p>
Right. An infallible global immune system would be reguired. A local <br>
immune system wouldn't stand a chance against black goo.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Nanosystems are always faced with "destruction by induction".  That is, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; can always destroy one cell; therefore you can destroy the whole thing.  To</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; defend against this, it is required that the system expand faster than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; destruction OR that it be impossible to destroy one cell.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Or that you can make the loss of a finite number of cells bearable. If their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; loss removes the threat (for example by forming a nanoscar), then the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; defense side will win.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I disagree with the whole concept of a nanoscar.  If there is such a thing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you turn it into your first line of defense, not wait until after you've been invaded.</i><br>
<p>
Right.<br>
