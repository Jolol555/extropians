One would expect so.  On the other hand, an interesting probe into that<br>
contention is Samuel R. Delany's 1976 science fiction novel TRITON (now<br>
republished in the USA as TROUBLE ON TRITON in order to convey a certain<br>
`pulp sf' flavour, a regrettable move).  The protagonist is a misogynistic<br>
and self-destructive son of a bitch in a heterotopic or `ambiguous' future<br>
utopia, who tries to solve his problem by changing sex.  He ends up as a...<br>
what? a miserable female son of a bitch.  Dem memes, dem memes, dem dry memes.<br>
<p>
Chip Delany, BTW, is a black, gay, upper-middle class writer who lives with<br>
a white former street person.  (You can read about him and his fiction and<br>
theories of textuality in my book READING BY STARLIGHT:  POSTMODERN SCIENCE<br>
FICTION.)  His skin is not that dark, and his features would perhaps allow<br>
him to `pass' if he wished to do so.  These days he's pretty hefty and<br>
heroically bearded and wears fearsome tats, and would probably find EvMICK<br>
in all his leather-&amp;-chains-glory *just* the kind of white meat he'd<br>
fancy...  Boo!  (Gotta watch that give-away unconscious, old son, thrum<br>
thrum the gears, screech the brakes.)  <br>
