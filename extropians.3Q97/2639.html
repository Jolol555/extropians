 Obviously, EvMick never knew Harry Truman.<br>
 If he had ever met him, and got to know him the way I did, he would know<br>
 that he was a mench and a great humanitarian. As far as I'm concerned, he<br>
 was the last real human being in the White House. <br>
 <br>

<p>
Well...no ...I never did.  And I might have to agree with your assesment<br>
concerning him being " the last real human being in the White House."  I sure<br>
don't think much of who's in there now.<br>
<p>
How ever, with all due respect, you might take note that I was DEFENDING Mr.<br>
Truman...in however a left-handed way.  Examine the quotes please.<br>
