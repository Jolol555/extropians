<p>
Lee, please don't judge &lt;who?&gt; so quickly:  I don't think that &lt;who?&gt;<br>
was claiming that you were interested (having curiosity, fascination, or<br>
concern) in the TEFLON TOPIC, but only that you have an interest (right,<br>
claim, share, involvement, or participation) in it.  I probably have an<br>
interest in _lots_ of things that I'm not interested in, including<br>
(perhaps to my detriment) the TEFLON TOPIC, whatever that is.<br>
<p>
&lt;who?&gt;, this may point out that a *brief* message pointing out to people<br>
what their interest is in the TEFLON TOPIC may generate more interest in<br>
it.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
