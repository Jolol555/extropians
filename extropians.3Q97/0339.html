In a message dated 97-07-11 22:50:18 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  My<br>
 only guess is that there are more efficient ways to get energy and matter<br>
 to convert to mind than paving the universe.  I do not have suggestions as<br>
 to what those are.  It's just that after a billion years, it would seem<br>
 intelligence would discover some physics we do not have an inkling of now &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
So true...and for enquireing minds who want to know...and have a well<br>
developed BS filter...there's a lot going on in the "overunity" and "cold<br>
fusion" sector of the web right now....also the "Aether" is enjoying a<br>
revival....and it all relates (more or less) to quantum mechanics.<br>
<p>
In response to my statement:As the level of affluence goes up....the<br>
birthrate goes down....<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
 The only reason that the U.S.'s population is going up is<br>
  immigration....the"natives" are below ZPG. As is true in other<br>
industrialized nations.<br>
<p>
<p>
you said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Irrelevant.  We have to take care of our young.   </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Naww... we don't GOTTA do anything....there is a very large sector of our<br>
population which is "Self Raised" so to speak....I seem to remember hearing<br>
that white female illigitamate births is at 16% and rising...while that of<br>
blacks is at 70% and holding stable...and all the dads are just wandering<br>
around looking for more girls.<br>
<p>
But that wasn't my point...I'm a parent...hell I'm a grandparent...and over<br>
the several generations of which I am intimately familar...family size is<br>
decreasing....so sometime in the decernible pressure population pressure will<br>
be less of a reason for expansion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Human beings are a badmodel for the far future of intelligence.</i><br>
<p>
And why are "Human beings a bad model"...I think we're doing pretty damn<br>
good...<br>
<p>
Look at the alternative....no other species can AFFORD to exhibit compassion.<br>
<p>
Look at current research into other primates..gorillas, chimps...they're not<br>
very nice people.	<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Virtual reality maybe fun but it does not get much accomplished.  You</i><br>
<i>&gt;cannot explore new physics without a connection to the outside world.  You</i><br>
<i>&gt;also cannot avoid dangers.  Those entities that concentrated their efforts</i><br>
<i>&gt;on avoiding real threats would be more successful than those that divided</i><br>
<i>&gt;their time between the real world and artificial worlds.  Survival (of</i><br>
<i>&gt;replicators) is the name of the game.  If it doesn't help survival, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;useless (evolutionarily speaking).</i><br>
<p>
au contrair.<br>
<p>
There are several versions of "virtual reality" of which I am aware...one<br>
"Augmented Reality" coupled with "Telepresence" would (and is..I'm sure) very<br>
useful in the exploration of new physics..biology..astrophysics...etc.<br>
<p>
And as far as threats and dangers?<br>
    "As I walk thru the valley of the shadow of death...I shall fear no<br>
evil..<br>
           Because I'm the meanest SOB in the valley"<br>
<p>
I'm sorry...It appears that you are fixated on classical pre-sentient,<br>
pre-technological evolution...perhaps not such a good model<br>
anymore....humanity is less and less subject to evolution...in fact the time<br>
will come..may already have come when we can direct our own<br>
development...(hmmmm ....isn't there a group somewhere on the net that talks<br>
about that a lot...?...things like Boundless Expansion..?)<br>
<p>
Lets see if I can hit this at a different angle..<br>
<p>
Remember Maslow?  He of the hierachy of needs? (warmth,<br>
food,..etc..etc...self actulazation)...we're talking about self actualization<br>
here...if all my fundamental needs are seen too I can explore new<br>
worlds...(for real or in cyberspace)...If a majority of a population feels<br>
that way...the population will not increase so rapidly...may even stabilize<br>
or decrease...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You might also want to chose a better metaphor.  I find "Expanding into</i><br>
<i>&gt;Cyberspace at many hundred multiples of lightspeed..." to be so vague</i><br>
(&gt;using c to measure distance through ideaspace, where there is no light) as<br>
<i>&gt;to be meaningless.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
picky...picky...picky...but ok...I grant you that.<br>
<p>
What I was trying to so ineloquently illustrate is the notion that with<br>
really advanced telepresence into cyberspace a civilization might be more<br>
inwardly focused...if all their material needs are taken care of by<br>
technology...if they no longer even have any material needs to speak of<br>
(uploaded )...then cyberspace would definitely be the thing. And is there a<br>
limit as to how far cyberspace can expand?  I can spend hours and hours just<br>
surfing the net...and the net is still young..<br>
