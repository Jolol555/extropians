<i>&gt;Excellent post!  I would also add that when people whinge about</i><br>
<i>&gt;'marketing' they forget that included in the price they pay is how </i><br>
<i>&gt;much it cost the company to bring the product to their attention and </i><br>
<i>&gt;make it easy to buy. In fact, when you hear those stories about the </i><br>
<i>&gt;poor widdle company that had a great product but got beaten by the </i><br>
<i>&gt;bastards that had better marketing, what is being blanked out is &gt;that, </i><br>
since advertising is part of the company's job and part of what &gt;you <br>
actually pay for, the poor widdle company was just crap at doing &gt;its <br>
job.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;i.e. the physical or conceptual item bought may have been ok, so the</i><br>
<i>&gt;poor widdle company did half their job well, but they didn't do the</i><br>
<i>&gt;other half very well: making it easy for you to buy it, so you knew it</i><br>
<i>&gt;was available and easy to buy when you needed it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Your observations are interesting and accurate.  The way John Clarke and <br>
yourself have presented it, Free-Market Economics seems to favor <br>
Marketing excellence over Technological superiority.<br>
<p>
As an Extropian, this is disconcerting to say the least!<br>
