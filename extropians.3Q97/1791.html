     <br>
     Referencing "Men and Marriage" by George Gilder, a not unrespected <br>
     writer, he indicates that no Matriarchial Society has been successful <br>
     due to terrorism by gangs of teenage boys...He cites present day <br>
     Ghetto Blacks as an example...among many examples...<br>
     <br>
     The cause of this appears to be deeply rooted.<br>
     <br>
     Rick responds:<br>
     <br>
     "not unrespected"? Is that like respected or almost respected? &lt;G&gt;<br>
     <br>
     So it's those nasty teenage boys (glad I had a girl...most of the <br>
     time) who are the impetus for all this eh?  I can see where that holds <br>
     true in Inner City situations.  But does not poverty factor in and <br>
     undermine matriarchal influence?  Poverty tends to numb one to the <br>
     hardships of day-to-day living.  That disempowerment of the women due <br>
     to poverty (particularly in regards to an ostensibly disempowered <br>
     cultural set due to racial inequality) could very well just open the <br>
     space for rampant teenage mayhem.<br>
     <br>
     Are there any examples where survival issues aren't weighing heavily <br>
     on the scenario so that teenage boys don't just "revert to type" (now <br>
     THAT'S a generalization! Woo-doggie!)?  Sorry, teenage boys tended to <br>
     make this former wimp's growing up life rather hellish at times &lt;G&gt;.<br>
     <br>
     I was rather focused on the cultural set that emerges out of the <br>
     high-tech embracing adherents which, if they are clever and somber <br>
     enough, could end up being atop the cultural food chain as far as <br>
     available choices go. (Would that make Bill Gates the King of Beasts?)<br>
