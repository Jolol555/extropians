<i>&gt; The flammability limits of hydrogen in AIR are 4.0 to 18.2 and again above</i><br>
<i>&gt; detonation limits at from 58.9 to 75%  with the 18.2 to 58.9% by volume zone</i><br>
<i>&gt; between the detonation limits this is a fuel it has to burn to work. Propane</i><br>
<i>&gt; in use everywhere with hardly anyone objecting has DETONATION limits from 2.1</i><br>
<i>&gt; to 9.5 in AIR! (would prefer to use hydrogen)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Sorry about that. I was responding with a recollection<br>
of hearsay instead of checking some sources. Thanks for the<br>
correction. However, I still seem to recall that the big concern<br>
with hydrogen included the risks of explosion when transported<br>
in pipelines. Does anyone have a reference for this?<br>
<p>
Note that there is a lot less hydrogen in a bettery-type fuel cell<br>
(i.e., one in which consumes electricity to produec hydrogen, then<br>
later used the hydrogen to produce electricity) than there is in<br>
a pipeline, so the safety engineering is probably more tractable.<br>
