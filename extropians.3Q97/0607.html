He is very involved in the Los Angeles spirituality community.  I'm not<br>
saying this is good or bad.  It is merely a fact.  Much of what he says I<br>
respect, he is fluid and writes in a comely manner.  Although he is listed<br>
as an associated on the masthead of spiritual organizations, I have yet to<br>
hear of him in more pragmatic future-oriented organizations.  If I am<br>
incorrect, enlighten me.<br>
