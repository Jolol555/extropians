I have heard ignorant people say that blacks must be closer to apes than <br>
white people because their nose looks more like an ape's. I point out that <br>
apes have thin lips just like white people and white's have more hair than <br>
blacks and their straight hair is similar to that of apes and no ape has <br>
anything like the kinky hair of blacks and if you shave off all that hair on <br>
a ape you will see a white skin. Does this mean that blacks are more highly <br>
evolved than whites?<br>
