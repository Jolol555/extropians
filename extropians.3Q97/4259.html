Well... you can "protest", but if you deduct from your taxes the<br>
guys with the guns and truncheons will come to take you away.<br>

<p>
Yep.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm being made to pay for a welfare system that anyone but a single</i><br>
<i>&gt; white straight educated male can get benefits from (I know, I tried</i><br>

<i>&gt; said I "deserved" and was "entitled to").</i><br>
<p>
Yep.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm being made to pay for research into and measures to reduce the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "greenhouse affect" that as far as anyone can tell isn't now and won't</i><br>
<i>&gt; anytime in the near future centuries be anywhere near the outside bounds</i><br>
<i>&gt; of normal terran climate variation. For all we know, our pollution is</i><br>
<i>&gt; protecting us from an ice age right now, and we don't even know it. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; solar flux and atmospheric data support this theory as much as they</i><br>
<i>&gt; support the theory that manmade pollution is causing a "greenhouse</i><br>
<i>&gt; effect".</i><br>
<p>
While I may be more concerned about possible man-made climate change than<br>
you, I essentially agree that there is no evidence that big government<br>
"solutions" are desirable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The two things I want the overwhelming majority of my tax money to go</i><br>
<i>&gt; to: space exploration and space technology/ifrastructure development are</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely atrophied. </i><br>
<p>
I would say that 4 (or N) wrongs don't make a right.  Statism is the<br>
problem, not the solution.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I accept as a given that if Cassini provides any data at all, it will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; benefit the human race.  However, although governments are good at quick</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and dirty projects and sometimes fund useful science, for the most part</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; politics governs decisions.  Science, by its nature, must be free and open</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; but even the most benign government bureaucracies tend toward their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; opposite.  "Big" science as practiced by government bureaucracies is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; wasteful and inflexible.  It is true that planetary exploration is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; CURRENTLY expensive and it APPEARS that only a government can fund it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But, if there is ever going to be an expansion of humanity beyond the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Earth, we will have to get the government out of the picture -- market</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; forces will yield solutions that will reduce costs and open up</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; possibilities for exploration and exploitation that will dwarf anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that government bureaucracies are likely to produce.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; So, the Cassini opponents, in their neo-Luddite way, actually have an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; important point to make and it behooves us to give it due consideration.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think the issue should be how government can effectively privatize space</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; -- in other words, how quickly government can get out of the picture.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True, but government should not get totally out of the picture until the</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological and infrastructure base is sufficient to be economical,</i><br>
<i>&gt; with growth, not just self sufficiency.</i><br>
<p>
This may be -- let's say I'm somewhat agnostic on the subject of whether<br>
or not a government needs to "prime the pump".  But, assuming that such<br>
may be necessary, I would want government involvement to be minimal,<br>
indirect, and of limited duration.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As seen in other posts on this subject, the human race is far far more</i><br>
<i>&gt; risk averse than they were back in the age of exploration, or even in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the earlier part of this century.</i><br>
<p>
I'd say we're more bureaucratized -- which produces the same effect.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; -- </i><br>

<p>
Yep.<br>
