I had this idea about 5 minutes ago, so forgive me if I've overlooked<br>
something embarrassingly obvious, made any number of grammatical errors, or<br>
it's just crap...<br>
<p>
I recently noticed that things like sound, graphics, 3D, etc. are migrating<br>
in to a single chip on new computers (Intel and MS have rival solutions for<br>
this!).  And also the release of the software modem, eventually we could have<br>
software soundcards, graphics adapters, etc. all running on a universal<br>
architecture.  After all this you end up with computers consisting of a<br>
processor and some memory.  But that's two thing, wouldn't it be better to<br>
have only one?<br>
<p>
A British company called _Division_ uses memory chips as processors, each<br>
chip contains lots of virtual processors (one per pixel) which are used for<br>
creating 3D graphics in Divisions VR simulators.  The _University Of North<br>
Carolina_ originally conceived the idea.  A central processor controls the<br>
array of memory chips; I don't know how it functions exactly so my idea is a<br>
bit speculative.  Here it is anyway:<br>
<p>
Move some of the CPU processing power on to the memory chips, just enough so<br>
they can take care of themselves and communicate with each other.  What you<br>
get is a Versatile Processing Unit (VPU) that can switch between the<br>
functions of RAM, ROM, Flash RAM and Processor.  Put a thousand of these<br>
chips in parallel and you get a Distributed Processing Array (DPA).  It has<br>
no CPU, no FPU, no graphics card, and no sound card - just a bunch of similar<br>
chips.<br>
<p>
Why?<br>
<p>
Many reasons (other than I'm obsessed with the notion of distribution):<br>
<p>
Economies of Scale - A VPU will never be as powerful as purpose built<br>
silicon, but it could be cheaper.  If you're mass-producing the same chip in<br>
thousands per system then the cost will keep falling.  Eventually you could<br>
end up with a higher price/performance ration than custom hardware.<br>
<p>
Security - How about duplicating calculations across two processors at any<br>
one time, on the fly backup of not only information but of actually<br>
processing.  The two processors could then compare results for error<br>
checking.  You could also have two processors doing the same calculation in<br>
different ways and then crosscheck them to make sure all areas are function<br>
correctly.  And then there's redundancy; one chip goes down another takes<br>
over.<br>
<p>
Economics - If you have custom hardware for graphics and you're not using it,<br>
it goes to waste.  If you're using VPU's nothing goes to waste.  You're using<br>
all the hardware all the time.<br>
<p>
Obviously there would have to be built-in security against people turning ROM<br>
into RAM and deleting its contents (and I'm sure you could come up with some<br>
great viruses for this architecture!).  And you would need an OS that could<br>
abstract the system so programmers don't have to worry about all those<br>
parallel VPU's (Taos?).<br>
<p>
Now I need to know:<br>
<p>
Has it been done before? <br>
And will it work?<br>
