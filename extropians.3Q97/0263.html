Joshua F. McMichael:<br>
<i>&gt;Why do you shy away from ranking philosophies? </i><br>
<p>
Every human is in part a product of their culture and environment, <br>
and each human has developed a particular perspective based on that.  <br>
We can learn to break out of that and learn to appreciate other <br>
perspectives, but ranking our modes of thought as better than other <br>
modes would necessarily create a barrier to broadening experience and <br>
learning. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Obviously some philosophies are better than others. </i><br>
<p>
This is not obvious to me, because you have not defined the ranking <br>
factors you have subsumed into the term 'better'.  I would critique a <br>
philosophy based on whether it takes an open-ended approach to <br>
important questions, whether it is internally consistent, etc.  These <br>
are the types of factors that mean 'useful' to me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You also state that "I prefer to think of it in terms:  'this set of </i><br>
<i>&gt;thinking is most useful to me in my life'.  If I cannot find a useful </i><br>
<i>&gt;philosphy, I would develop one!" Aren't you simply then *judging </i><br>
<i>&gt;(ranking)* a philosophy by how it makes you *feel* at any particular </i><br>
<i>&gt;moment?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think that the usefulness of a philsophy depends on how it <br>
makes me 'feel.'  To the contrary, I find useful those philosophies <br>
that force me out of comfortable modes of thought.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What's scary about Richter's "position" of no-positions is that after </i><br>
<i>&gt;discarding all the abstract concepts that philosophy contains - </i><br>
<i>&gt;principles, values, ethics, etc. - the only thing Richter will have left </i><br>
<i>&gt;to decide and judge his actions will be *feelings*.</i><br>
<p>
Let's be very careful here--Richter said nothing about discarding <br>
philsophy in general and focused entirely on ideology.  Philosphy is a <br>
mental discipline that encourages questioning and rigorous <br>
examination;  ideology discourages critical thinking and relies on <br>
emotions such as fear and insecurity, and as such it is used as a <br>
tool by those who would control others.  Richter had first-hand <br>
experirence in his own life of how ideology is used to control and <br>
imprison other humans, and I greatly admire him for standing up <br>
against it.<br>
