   Dear Extropians, <br>
<p>
   I am on of you.  I am intelligent, hard working and in my deepest <br>
   yearnings an extropian to the core.  Despite this I am falling behind. <br>
I am <br>
   dying (slowly).  Despite my best efforts at maintaining a healthy body, <br>
   quick mind, balanced diet, and adequate regiment of exercise, <br>
   anti-ozidants and smart drugs - I AM BURNING OUT.  I am hitting, like a<br>
brick <br>
   wall, the limits of my biology and psychology/neurology.  I can no<br>
longer <br>
   keep up with the demands the free-market is placing on me.  At the rate <br>
   everything is accelerating, things can only get worse for me.  I will be<br>
<p>
   lucky to be alive in 5 years - I will run out of energy far sooner.<br>
<p>
I reply:<br>
<p>
Please explain this.  I know it's not considered polite to ask, but just<br>
how old are you?<br>
<p>
Holly continues:<br>
<p>
   Despite working over 50 hours per week and spending another 10 keeping <br>
   up with science &amp; technology trends, I am still falling behind <br>
   economically.  I expect the skills I have now will be obsolete by the<br>
end of 98. <br>
<p>
Falling behind what?  If you are intelligent and hard-working, you probably<br>
have many skills.  I seriously doubt that all of them will be obsolete by<br>
the end of '98.  What do you do professionally?<br>
<p>
Holly continues:<br>
<p>
   I no longer have the time nor energy to gain new skills at the rate <br>
   required by todays free-market.  <br>
<p>
Explain for me, if you will, exactly what rate is "required" by the<br>
free-market.  Required for what?  To be wealthy?  To maintain an income of<br>
X dollars per year?  To service your current debt?  To live in the style to<br>
which you've become accustomed?<br>
<p>
One of many solutions to being overworked in order to maintain your<br>
lifestyle is to change your lifestyle.  If it's too hard for you, it might<br>
be time to simplify.  There are *many* ways to simplify without dying.  And<br>
there are many ways to continue to use the skills you already have without<br>
allowing yourself to become completely obsolete.<br>
<p>
Holly continues:<br>
<p>
   I will probably be obsolete within 2 <br>
   years and dead with 5 unless something very *fundamental* changes from<br>
the <br>
   free-market hell which is killing me.<br>
<p>
Even before hearing more details about your situation, I simply can't<br>
believe that obsoletion and death are the only alternatives on the horizon<br>
for you without a huge change in the "free-market hell."  What about the<br>
things you have the power to change?  (And I'm not talking about improving<br>
your skills.)<br>
<p>
Holly continues:<br>
<p>
   Now this is pretty sad when I share your extropian dreams of a better <br>
   future while at the same time being increasingly being denied <br>
   opportunity from achieving them.  <br>
<p>
You have yet to demonstrate that the free-market is denying you anything. <br>
We are all (more or less) in the same boat right now with regard to<br>
immortality, uploading, nanotechnology, and a host of other expected future<br>
changes.  I.e., right now, *none* of us has the wealth (individually or<br>
collectively) to make them happen.  In the meantime, although acquiring<br>
increasing wealth is certainly a good strategy for positioning yourself to<br>
take advantage of those changes as they become available, it is not the<br>
only strategy.<br>
<p>
In particular, the most important aspect to *any* plan for getting there is<br>
simply to *stay alive*.  If your lifestyle is driving you into the grave,<br>
then it's time to change your lifestyle.  (I hope that any of the many<br>
people on this list who have looked into simplified lifestyles -- such as<br>
self-contained van/home units -- will pipe in with some information about<br>
how it is possible to live more simply, cheaply, and happily.)  If you are<br>
over the age of 50 (40 for men, I'd say), then you should give serious<br>
consideration to diverting some of your money to making cryonics<br>
arrangements for yourself.  (Folks in those age groups run a significant<br>
risk of missing the advent of nanotech and biological immortality no matter<br>
HOW wealthy they are.)<br>
<p>
Holly continues:<br>
<p>
    I am a human being and I am an extropian.<br>
<p>
These are both heavily in your favor, but no guarantees of success<br>
whatsoever, free market or no.<br>
<p>
Holly continues:<br>
<p>
		I DESERVE TO LIVE!<br>
<p>
		I DESERVE TO THRIVE!<br>
<p>
    ...and so does every other human on this planet who wants to live and <br>
    have a better future.<br>
<p>
I will leave to others to address the usage of the word "deserve" here. <br>
Meanwhile, let me just say that, semantics aside, I generally agree with<br>
you.  You SHOULD be able to make it, and I want you to.  I don't know if I<br>
want EVERY human to make it, but certainly the vast majority of them.  You<br>
have a chance to make it, still, and it will probably be the free market<br>
that makes it possible for you to get there.<br>
<p>
Holly continues:<br>
<p>
   Look, I want to evolve as much as the next person - but I should have <br>
   the right to grow at *my* pace.  <br>
<p>
It is not a "right." Nevertheless, you are free to grow at your own pace. <br>
Everyone is free in this way, and in fact if you look around you will see 5<br>
billion examples of people growing at their own pace.<br>
<p>
Holly continues:<br>
<p>
   Dont you get it?  I am evolving as <br>
   fast as I can!  But the free-market (an autoevolutionary and human <br>
   invention if there ever was one - and one which almost everyone on this<br>
list <br>
   praises) <br>
<p>
It's not an invention any more than evolution is an invention.  Spontaneous<br>
order is just that -- spontaneous.<br>
<p>
Holly continues:<br>
 <br>
   doesnt give a DAMN about *my* pace.  EITHER I ADAPT TO *ITS* PACE <br>
   OR DIE!   <br>
<p>
This is not so.  There is not one pace which doesn't lead to death.  More<br>
positively, there are many, many paces which can lead to living and<br>
thriving.<br>
<p>
Holly continues:<br>
<p>
   As the Bionomics Institute as so poignantly pointed out The <br>
   free-market follows the dictates of biological evolution where the <br>
   strongest, smartest and fittest survive(end quote).  <br>
<p>
I've never like the phrase "survival of the fittest," and in fact I think<br>
it is downright wrong.  A better phrase would be "survival of the FIT." <br>
Watch "Wild Discovery" on the Discovery Channel sometime and you will see<br>
that there are many, many strategies which lead to survival of a species. <br>
One of the keys is strength, but there are many types of strength.  Ability<br>
to adapt to an environment is the main one.  If your environment is too<br>
harsh, remaining FIT means finding a way to adapt to it.  Whether you do<br>
this through the Carniverous Teeth and Claws strategy, or by burrowing<br>
yourself a little cave in the side of a mountain and eating berries, the<br>
point is to adapt.  For you, that may or may not mean acquiring new skills.<br>
 It may mean nothing more than changing your focus.<br>
<p>
Holly continues:<br>
<p>
   Now if that is not a Fascist dictate what the fuck is?!<br>
<p>
I reproduce part of Greg Burch's excellent post:<br>
<p>
      Unless one is discussing a party of armed psychopathic bigots <br>
      intent on world-scale violence with a program of pseudoscientific <br>
      eugenics, the word "Nazi" is hyperbole of a sort that does no <br>
      credit to a writer.<br>
<p>
Holly continues:<br>
<p>
   Again, help - I want to live!  I want to live in the amazing future <br>
   that is unfolding.  Shouldnt everyone get an *EQUAL* chance to live<br>
well <br>
   in the future? <br>
<p>
Wow, that's quite a question.  <br>
<p>
Should?  If I were George Carlin, I'd say should is a BAD word.  At the<br>
very least, it's not very useful, and doesn't add much information due to<br>
the incredible number of questions it begs.<br>
<p>
Everyone?  No.  Not all humans are good and worthy by my standards.  Are<br>
you forlorn that Hitler didn't make it, and doesn't have the opportunity to<br>
see this bright future?  To me, most humans are worth saving, but certainly<br>
not all of them.<br>
<p>
Equal?  Depending on you define it, total equality of opportunity is either<br>
impossible, or already the case.  <br>
<p>
Live?  I'd like to see biological immortality be a given, but we are far<br>
from that.  I can't think of a faster way to get us there than a thriving<br>
free-market economy.  <br>
<p>
Live Well?  Define "well."  If you mean, be biologically immortal and have<br>
enough to eat, then yes, I'd sure like to see that be a guarantee in the<br>
future, but again, we're not there yet, and you haven't shown that a more<br>
centrally organized economy will make it more likely.<br>
<p>
Holly continues:<br>
<p>
   Otherwise arent extropians nazis - either by choice or by default?<br>
<p>
   Sincerely,<br>
<p>
   Holly Pearson<br>
<p>
No, no, and no.  Again, see Greg Burch's excellent post for more insight<br>
into this question.<br>
<p>
I don't know you, Holly, but it sure sounds like you're engaging in<br>
personal disasturbation here.  Is it really that bad?  If so, remember in<br>
all your railings against the "tyranny" of the free-market that we really<br>
*don't* live in a totally free-market economy yet.  If you've got problems<br>
you can't handle, there are governmental handouts and concessions to be<br>
had.  Even if that were not the case, I think most free-market proponents<br>
here still see value in charity, and believe that you would have many<br>
options for obtaining charity even if there were no government or church to<br>
get it from.<br>
<p>
I sincerely hope your world brightens up for you.<br>
<p>
