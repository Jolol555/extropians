<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What will you change?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think I'll be changing anything -- or rather, I suspect I'll<br>
be changing everything. The question is much like someone in 1850<br>
asking "given that some time soon we will be able to build large<br>
steam driven wheeled tractors shaped like horses to pull around our<br>
carriages, what color are you going to paint yours?"<br>
<p>
The human body is all fine and well for its purpose, and has lots of<br>
neato design elements, but frankly, I don't see much of a point in<br>
retaining a body if V.R. gets good enought that one can transfer one's<br>
locus to a large well constructed and much more survivable computer<br>
system. If you need to walk around and for nostalgia reasons you want<br>
the vehicle to look like a human body, you can operate or teleoperate<br>
a robotic simulacrum of one that will likely be far stronger and more<br>
capable anyway.<br>
<p>
I'm sure there will be those who for whatever reason who simply make<br>
minor modifications to their bodies or no changes at all -- just as<br>
there are those who, to this day, use horse drawn carriages as a<br>
primary means of transportation. The species is likely to fragment and<br>
differentiate into a thousand directions, and it would be surprising<br>
if some people didn't retain "ordinary" human bodies. However, the<br>
advantages of switching to a substrate where I am no longer<br>
constrained by current limits on mental power, memory, sensory inputs<br>
and such seems to be way too compelling.<br>
<p>
I may (for at least a time) prefer to spend some CPU cycles convincing<br>
my own "virtual senses" that I am in fact sitting inside an ordinary<br>
body still surrounded by a "virtual world", (one has speculative and<br>
possibly unlikely visions of doing one's work on the veranda of a<br>
pretty estate in perfect spring weather, visiting friends in their<br>
"houses", etc.), but in reality I might be instantiated in a giant<br>
nanocomputer floating out in space somewhere, surrounded by a cloud of<br>
defensive systems, construction nanobots, nanofactories, etc.<br>
<p>
Of course, this is all speculation. Five seconds in to a<br>
trillion-times-faster life/thoughtstyle, I might discover something<br>
far more interesting than being a giant nanocomputer. Indeed, I almost<br>
certainly will. However, from my current perspective, that is one<br>
possible short term destination. (Necessarily a very limited<br>
perspective, too -- who can even envision the changes in question at<br>
more than the crudest level?  This is far, far worse than a Roman<br>
philosopher speculating on the nature of 20th century life... -- it is<br>
even far worse than a cat speculating about what a human's life is<br>
like...)<br>
