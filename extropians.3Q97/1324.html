Stumbled across this the other day...  It's the best search engine I've<br>
seen yet.  It uses a system which it calls "Hyperlink Vector Voting" to<br>
rank the sites through which it crawls, using the anchored descriptions as<br>
the criteria, rather than the site itself.  I'd love to see AltaVista,<br>
HotBot, or one of the other large crawlers implement something like this.<br>
<p>
"The crucial innovation of Hyperlink Vector Voting is to collect anchor<br>
descriptions as the content of a searchable database.=A0 Each description is<br>
associated in the database with the referenced site, not the site where the<br>
link appeared.=A0 In this way, the descriptions constitute "votes" as to the<br>
subject of the referenced site.=A0 Counting these votes provides a<br>
decentralized and democratic way to identify what each web site is about.=A0<br>
The "vector" in Hyperlink Vector Voting refers to the mathematics used for<br>
weighting the votes according to frequency. [...]<br>
<p>
"We think the best way to evaluate the Hyperlink Search Engine is as<br>
follows.=A0 Ask it about subjects for which you already know the strongest<br>
web sites.=A0 For example, if your hobby is raising guinea pigs, and you kno=<br>
w<br>
the major guinea pig web sites, then search on guinea pigs, and see which<br>
sites it returns among those you would rate as the top ones.=A0 Then submit<br>
the same query to other search engines and let us know how the results<br>
compare!"<br>
