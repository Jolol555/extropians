There are a great many examples of such phenomena described in section 5 of<br>
<a href="http://wcl-l.bham.ac.uk/origins/faqs/faq-speciation.html">http://wcl-l.bham.ac.uk/origins/faqs/faq-speciation.html</a>.<br>
<p>
Here's a famous (and ironic) story:<br>
<p>
In 1927, the Soviet cytologist Karpchenko crossed the radish, Raphanus<br>
sativus, with the cabbage, Brassica oleracea, trying to produce a plant with<br>
the leaves of a cabbage and the roots of a radish. Despite the fact that the<br>
plants were in different genera, he got a viable hybrid.  The hybrids were<br>
interfertile with each other, but not interfertile with either parental<br>
species. Unfortunately the new plant (genus Raphanobrassica) had the foliage<br>
of a radish and the root of a cabbage.  It is not recorded whether Stalin<br>
had him shot for his failure.<br>
<p>
Topic change:<br>
<p>
I found document this by recalling that I had once heard of such a case,<br>
years ago, and the organism's name was raphanobrassica.  That made it easy<br>
to find this document through Alta Vista.  Perhaps in the age of search<br>
engines, the best way to learn information is to assosciate a few bizarre<br>
buzzwords with any topic, just as I assosciated 'speciation through<br>
hybridization' with 'raphanobrassica'.  Then it will be easy to pull up the<br>
actual information when you need it.  <br>
<p>
This might be called the 'hapax legomena strategy'.  (A hapax legomena is a<br>
word or phrase that occurs only once in a given corpus).<br>
<p>
It occurs to me that I have been using this strategy unconsciously.  Rather<br>
than keep bookmarks to some topics, when I need to know about technical<br>
diving, I look for articles containing 'trimix', and when I need to know<br>
about stellar nucleosynthesis, I look for 'helium flash'.  Who needs a<br>
bookmark file when you've got a vocabulary?<br>
