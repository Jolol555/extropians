<i>&gt; I'm not sure that your low end number is literally true. I'm going to</i><br>

<i>&gt; for the low end. It may (in fact, I expect it will) depend on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; timescale you measure.</i><br>
<p>
The low end number applies to several WW I &amp; II military craft that were<br>
rugged and reliable. Most of their additional maintenance had to do with<br>
battle damage.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;higher maintenance requirements, with the exception of some of our new</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;military planes like the F-22, but vehicles like the space shuttle and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the stealth bomber are still way up above the top of the range.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Bzzzt! Have you further considered that that's because they're absurdly</i><br>
<i>&gt; specified and designed, by political and pocket-lining</i><br>
<i>&gt; creatures? </i><br>
<p>
By what basis do you make this assertion? There is no politics in<br>
engineering. The more complex a device, and the more severe its<br>
operating environment, the greater its maintenance requirements.<br>
<p>
You do know the story of the B-1 and of F-111s, right?<br>
<i>&gt; To take the latter example, suppose I insisted on fielding a full</i><br>
<i>&gt; complement of F-111s (the B variant, I think) fully loaded with Phoenix</i><br>
<i>&gt; on an aircraft carrier. You're going to have hella high maintenance</i><br>
<i>&gt; if you really want to keep everything flying; in fact the carrier may</i><br>
<i>&gt; never be the same, either:). Those tubs land *hard*.</i><br>
<p>
F-111s have been flown on carriers, and were originally supposed to be a<br>
multiservice platform. The naval version was going to have several more<br>
struts in the fuselage, a sturdier wing, and heftier landing gear.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; MTBF very much depends on how rich you are, how carefree you are (i.e.</i><br>
<i>&gt; "what's a failure?"), and how superior your tech is to the requirements.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I suspect strongly that the maint-to-flight hours ratio (whatever that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; called in aero, I forget) is, too.</i><br>
<p>
No matter how steep a difference between tech level and operating<br>
regieme, higher tech always has higher maint time. There is a difference<br>
between tech level and the quality of construction. A crappy Edsel of a<br>
flying saucer will still be more likely to crash than a hot air balloon.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The long term data isn't in for things like composites and the Zoche</i><br>
<i>&gt; turbo diesel, but I suspect they, or what comes after them, will</i><br>
<i>&gt; start stretching those numbers out into the sub-1 range.</i><br>
<p>
The trouble with failures in composites is that there is not usually a<br>
soft failure. You can't detect cracks until it gives way under strain,<br>
and when it does, it shatters. This is why new composite wings are<br>
stress tested on the ground far in excess of their operating margins.<br>
This does not mean that they will not fail over time.<br>
<p>
You think that there will be less than 1 maint hour per flight hour? It<br>
hasn't happened yet, and the curve averages upward over time, so I doubt<br>
that it will happen for anything but the most low stress flight regeimes<br>
for quite a while.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;As for your assertion of any visitors not being detected, this goes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;against logic. Given that some group, corporation, or government on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;another planet would have shelled out billions if not trillions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;EBE-bucks for such an expedition, the idea that they would not try to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;wring out the maximum PR, scientific, or economic value from that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;investment is ludicrous.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ah, but why is this a given at all? And who says they'd derive any</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefit from being seen? How can you (or Hara Ra) be sure you know</i><br>
<i>&gt; what their payoff matrix is for be3ing seen? What if their motto</i><br>
<i>&gt; really is "Primum non nocere (at least at first...)"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
So your beleive in alien abductions?<br>
<p>
Because Occams razor tells me if screwed up creatures like us with our<br>
screwed up ways of doing things can make it, then any visitors are just<br>
as likely to come from screwed up planets as well, and just as likely to<br>
have short sighted, self centered, idiotic politicians and bureaucrats<br>
in charge of things on their home planet. The ideas that people get from<br>
Star Trek  are much more unlikely than things continuing much as they<br>
are now.<br>
<p>
Read Scott Adams new book, Dilbert Futures, in which he states "The<br>
future will NOT be like Star Trek." because people will still be as<br>
screwed up as they are now, they'll just have cooler high tech toys to<br>
be screwed up with.<br>
