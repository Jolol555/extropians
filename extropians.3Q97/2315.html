Hmm...<br>
<p>
If we want to use the immune system analogy, the term "active <br>
shield" is perhaps a little misleading. One thinks of some kind of <br>
spherical wall, but is what you have in mind somthing that would <br>
permeate the whole domain? If it's just a wall, might it not be much<br>
cheaper to blow a hole in it (with (nuclear?) explosives) than to <br>
rebuild it? Then nanites could be sent in and devastate the <br>
unprotected interior.<br>
<p>
If it's not just a wall then there is still the question of power <br>
balance. I agree with you that biology gives us hope in this respect: <br>
higher organisms can and do survive in an environment with naturally <br>
evolved viruses and bacteria. We need to consider:<br>
<p>
(1) What if the parasites were designed instead of evolved? (Design <br>
is better than sex. Remember, just because we might think sex is <br>
more interesting doesn't mean it's more plausible!) Perhaps the fact <br>
that the defence would also be designed would conterbalance this <br>
factor. <br>
<p>
(2) What if new chemical reactions are introduced? Will complicated <br>
higher organisms still be viable? Exactly what properties of the <br>
system does this depend on? Does anybody have any idea of how to get <br>
a handle on this problem?<br>
