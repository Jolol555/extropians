Yes, I have heard this story (there are several cases like this,<br>
usually involving people born with cataracts). Since their visual<br>
cortices didn't get any input during the critical periods of early<br>
childhood, they didn't organize properly and when they could see they<br>
had no working three-dimensional perception. I'm not sure how well<br>
they learned to handle it, as far as I know no amount of spiritual<br>
preparation can organize a working visual cortex. On the other hand,<br>
I think that training could help, at least partially (the brain is<br>
amazingly flexible), but if the low-level functions have noot been<br>
developed during the critical periods normal perception may be<br>
possible. <br>
