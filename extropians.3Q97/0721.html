In a message dated 97-07-16 09:34:50 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Besides, isn't savannahs (or coastal areas if you believe in the<br>
 aquatic ape theory)  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I'm unfamiliar with the "aquatic ape theory"...apes appear unsuited to an<br>
aquatic enviroment.<br>
<p>
One "theory" which I read once (Analog SF/SF...back in the 70's or 80's I<br>
think, fact Article) dealt with cursorial hunters and the origin of man.<br>
<p>
A cursorial hunter being defined as a pack hunter, like wolves.  Early man<br>
would chase his intended prey until it collapsed...then feast.<br>
<p>
Supportive physiological facts include man's exceptionally high leg length to<br>
body height ratio (relative to other primates) exceptional cooling system<br>
(."....only mad dogs and englishmen..) (I know from personal and tragic<br>
experience that I can endure a great deal more heat than a dog), and<br>
exceptional endurance (as late as the latter part of the last<br>
century...calvary was being snookered by Apache Braves on foot...in the<br>
desert southwest....not far from where I am now...(El Paso))<br>
<p>
Co-incidental with this new lifestyle...man's brain size enlarged.  (read a<br>
book...can't think of title...get back to you on this...it's at the<br>
house...i'm not)  not in response to a need for greater cognitive<br>
capacity....but in response to a need to maintain a thermal balance.  (large<br>
percentage of blood flows thru brain....large amount of heat is radiated from<br>
head.)  Intelligence was a "target of opportunity" because even mother nature<br>
" can't do just one thing)<br>
<p>
And sometime later....all that available gray matter become Memetically<br>
Infected..one of which was the Meme of "consciousness".<br>
