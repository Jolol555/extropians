That is an interesting question.  The interesting part is about<br>
the "rays" being gamma, meaning they are above the threshold for<br>
conversions into e+e- pairs.<br>
<p>
To partially answer your question, light does travel "slower than<br>
light" in interstellar space because it is not travelling through<br>
a perfect vacuum, but rather through a diluted gas, mostly hydrogen.<br>
In engineering terms, that gas has a dielectric constant slightly<br>
different from 1, so the speed of light changes accordingly<br>
(c=sqrt(epsilon*mu)).  Since the cross-sections for various<br>
scattering processes change with wavelength, so does the dielectric<br>
constant (i.e. if you hit an absorption line, tough luck).  I<br>
vaguely remember a discussion about estimating the density of<br>
interstellar matter by measuring the delay between the arrival of<br>
neutrinos and visible light from a supernova, neutrinos being the<br>
"control sample" since they don't significantly interact with matter.<br>
<p>
Now to the interesting part.  I admit I've never given any thought<br>
to what happens as you cross the e+e- threshold.  A back of the<br>
proverbial envelope calculation tells me that the elastic<br>
cross-section goes down with energy so the velocity of wavefront<br>
propagation goes to c, but you get conversions which snatch photons<br>
from the beam and so reduce intensity.  Therefore, to first<br>
approximation gammas travel at c, and lose intensity; visible<br>
light (and infrared, etc.) travels at c minus epsilon and doesn't<br>
get much dimmer unless it matches an absorption line of whatever<br>
it goes through.  Corrections anyone?<br>
<p>
