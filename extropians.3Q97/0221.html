Well, I've been trying to look into this, although I'm hampered by my lack<br>
of expertise in astrophysics. The Solar system formed about five billion<br>
years ago. One of the reasons that life could form here is that the cloud<br>
from which it formed was already enriched with oxygen and carbon. The Big<br>
Bang (if that's what happened) produced only hydrogen and helium, and <br>
happened only some seven to thirteen billion years before the formation of<br>
the Solar system. It would take a certain amount of time for enough large<br>
stars to form and go supernova to enrich the interstellar clouds of our<br>
galaxy with the oxygen and carbon that were available at the time the Solar<br>
system formed. When I try to answer the question "How much time at a<br>
minimum would be required to form and disperse the necessary amount of<br>
heavier elements?" I find I get led into astrophysics textbooks and papers<br>
that are too hairy for me to understand without devoting a lot of time to<br>
it, and they don't present "the Answer" to this question in the abstracts<br>
or conclusions from which a layperson could easily grab it. So to me, it<br>
seems like an open queston. If anyone can close it for me, I'd appreciate<br>
it.<br>
<p>
In the meantime, though, it seems entirely possible to me that we just <br>
happen to be the first on the block, and that's my hypothesis (shared by<br>
several others, some of whom suggested it to me) about Fermi's Paradox.<br>
