<p>
<i>&gt;From what i remember reading from Bouchard, Segal, Mc Gue, (can't remember</i><br>
the title exactly) they were using their research data to support their<br>
views about the influence of ones genetic coding being an 'ignorable'<br>
factor. In the book i (quickly) read through, they were holding a strong<br>
position against the new right ideas in biology, probably in an attempt to<br>
counter racial prejudice. I could have taken their ideas to heart, if their<br>
ethics had left some more room for individual capacities.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From what i've gathered, Bouchard, Segal etc are representing left wing</i><br>
political ethics in biology, Dawkins probably a right wing. I've read<br>
material from both, and find both their writings contradicting at times,<br>
and straying too much from the scientific into other fields (whether<br>
ethical or layman), to take the explanations of their data 100% seriously.<br>
I prefer people like Raup, who are not affraid to take up controversial<br>
issues, but don't soke their pages with their personal opinions, or tie<br>
every remotely relevant finding to their conclusion every other line, which<br>
IMO shows uncertainty.   <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;From my absolute layman experience with genetics in animals, i  noticed</i><br>
that intelligence is linked to countless factors, with probably as many<br>
exceptions as there are rules, yet that it was definitely genetic.<br>
Overestimating the influence of genetic factors, or concentrating attention<br>
on one, or a few of those factors is what feeds prejudice. Denying genetic<br>
factors have an influence, or that their influence is 'ignorable' is just<br>
being unrealistic.  <br>
