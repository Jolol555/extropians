I'd be more sanguine about that if "sending in the troops"<br>
had a better record.  Politicians do the sending, after all.<br>

I left something out.  The Weavers, as far as I know, did not<br>
advocate forcible separation of the races (that's a lost cause).<br>
They just separated themselves, taking a voluntary action<br>
at great inconvenience to themselves.  But one can't expect a<br>
statist like Harlan Ellison to grasp the distinction between<br>
adopting a solution for oneself and forcing it on others.<br>

Have I finished now?  I think so.<br>
