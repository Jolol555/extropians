I think what's going on is practice at argument with others, not just<br>
practice at thinking.  The more convinced you are, the more convincing<br>
you can be.  Committment--cutting one's retreat--makes one<br>
harder to intimidate with threats.  In fact seeming crazy helps, too.<br>
<p>
I guess that arguing without commitment is a more complicated skill than<br>
committing to harmless beliefs.  If it's less complicated, committing to<br>
trivia would leave more of your brain for actual arguing--giving you better<br>
practice--and would also be an easier skill to discover by unconscious<br>
learning or evolution.<br>
<p>
A slight variation: maybe being consciously in doubt puts you at a<br>
disadvantage in an argument, so it's better not to consciously<br>
doubt your "beliefs," at least not while you're arguing them.  Plus,<br>
they have to be consistent from argument to argument.<br>
<p>
Gregory Bateson says that dogs know the difference between play fighting<br>
and real fighting.  But they have to get into a fight to know which they're<br>
doing.  I don't think dogs have an *idea* of play, or pretend.  They have<br>
something like a sense of fun, a sense that they're stretching their<br>
abilities without getting hurt.  Argument could have evolved from<br>
unthinking play-fighting.<br>
