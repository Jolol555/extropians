<i>&gt; Beliefs are also both functional and social...</i><br>
<p>
Good essay.  I have often thought that the very institutions of belief<br>
I despise in most contexts may serve important social goals that it<br>
would be dangerous not to replace; thus I have suggested creating new<br>
mythologies, holidays, gathering functions, etc.  Perhaps even the<br>
irrational beliefs themselves serve some of those functions.  I would<br>
not hesitate to create church-like or state-like social systems by<br>
voluntary association to fill some of those roles.<br>
<p>
Although I think you ignore what to me seems like an equally likely--<br>
and more cynical--posibility: that people associtate with belief-<br>
based social groups specifically to /hide/ their true beliefs.  That<br>
people may be active Democrats, for example, to make people think they<br>
care about the less fortunate without having to actually do any of the<br>
hard work of genuinely caring.<br>
