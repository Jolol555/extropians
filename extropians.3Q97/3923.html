Yes, indeed. The IRS is (as the French say) fucked. But they knew about<br>
this computer deficiency as early as 1985. I took a quick look at the<br>
Congressional Record, and found this:<br>
<p>
Congressional Record -- Senate<br>
Thursday, December 12, 1985; <br>
(Legislative day of Monday, December 9, 1985)<br>
99th Cong. 1st Sess.<br>
131 Cong Rec S 17495<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; SEN. ARLEN SPECTER: </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; My own concern on this subject arose </i><br>
<i>&gt; in January 1985 when I wrote to Commissioner Egger regarding </i><br>
<i>&gt; the computer breakdown at the Philadelphia Center in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; fall of 1984. This unprecedented breakdown resulted in </i><br>
<i>&gt; thousands of threatening letters erroneously being generated </i><br>
<i>&gt; to area businesses which had, in fact, obeyed the law and </i><br>
<i>&gt; did not deserve such warnings of imminent property and bank </i><br>
<i>&gt; account seizure.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, following this unhappy event, circumstances </i><br>
<i>&gt; went from bad to worse at the Philadelphia IRS Service Center, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and apparently, at centers throughout the country. My office </i><br>
<i>&gt; was deluged by telephone calls and letters from Pennsylvanians </i><br>
<i>&gt; who were awaiting refunds, and who were unable even to establish </i><br>
<i>&gt; contact with the service center due to inadequate phone lines </i><br>
<i>&gt; to service these rightfully irate taxpayers.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;SNIP&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This reluctance on the part of Commissioner Egger and the IRS </i><br>
<i>&gt; to face squarely the issues and problems raised during the past </i><br>
<i>&gt; year is deeply disturbing. A totally candid confrontation is </i><br>
<i>&gt; necessary in order to organize future operations and to arrange </i><br>
<i>&gt; for contingency plans. This type of candid awareness is now </i><br>
<i>&gt; absent in the IRS. Commissioner Egger's responses to questions </i><br>
<i>&gt; posed at the November 19, 1985 Washington hearing further </i><br>
<i>&gt; indicate that such an awareness has long been absent from </i><br>
<i>&gt; collective IRS thinking. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; One example of this is shown by the Commissioner's repeated </i><br>
<i>&gt; unwillingness to acknowledge the severe plight of the computer </i><br>
<i>&gt; operation in all 10 service centers for the 1985 season, </i><br>
<i>&gt; despite the fact that testimony shows notification by his staff, </i><br>
<i>&gt; almost 1 full year in advance, that "massive backlogs" could </i><br>
<i>&gt; result. Yet even during the midst of this crisis, Commissioner </i><br>
<i>&gt; Egger reassured the House Ways and Means Committee on March 11, </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1985, that these were "transitional problems," a "shakedown period" </i><br>
<i>&gt; of "working out the bugs in the equipment." A definite change of </i><br>
<i>&gt; approach and attitude by the IRS is needed if such problems are </i><br>
<i>&gt; to be avoided in the future. </i><br>
<p>
Of course these computer problems were put on the back burner. <br>
<p>
Now look at this:<br>
<p>
<p>
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- EXTENSIONS<br>
Friday, August 1, 1997<br>
105th Congress, 1st Session<br>
143 Cong Rec E 1605<br>
REFERENCE: Vol. 143, No. 112 <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; REP. ROBERT PORTMAN (OH): Congress created the National Commission </i><br>
<i>&gt; on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service in response to mounting </i><br>
<i>&gt; public concerns about the performance of the IRS.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;SNIP&gt; <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The commission found a serious lack of expertise, continuity and </i><br>
<i>&gt; accountability in the management structure of the IRS. Over the </i><br>
<i>&gt; years, IRS has developed an insular culture that is often resistant </i><br>
<i>&gt; to input and ideas from outside the agency--preventing leaders at </i><br>
<i>&gt; the top of the organization from effecting real changes. When things </i><br>
<i>&gt; go wrong, such as the $4 billion computer modernization failure, </i><br>
<i>&gt; no one is clearly responsible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Billions of taxpayer dollars were wasted on the tax systems </i><br>
<i>&gt; modernization program "due to pervasive management and technical </i><br>
<i>&gt; weaknesses" according to GAO. In 1995, the GAO described the same </i><br>
<i>&gt; efforts as "chaotic" and "ad hoc." </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The IRS has failed a number of recent audits by the General Accounting </i><br>
<i>&gt; Office and is unable to balance its own books. At the same time, </i><br>
<i>&gt; we're spending more on the IRS than ever--the IRS budget has almost </i><br>
<i>&gt; tripled since the Carter administration and now stands at $7.3 billion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And, the Department of Treasury has not demonstrated a historic pattern</i><br>
<i>&gt; of effective oversight of the IRS--often ignoring problems until they </i><br>
<i>&gt; have reached crisis proportions. There are no clear lines of </i><br>
<i>&gt; accountability and responsibility in the current IRS-Treasury </i><br>
<i>&gt; relationship. And, Treasury often advocates tax policy goals that </i><br>
<i>&gt; create administrative nightmares for the IRS. </i><br>
<p>
A few observations:<br>
<p>
Congress has known of the computer deficiency since the 1984 tax season.<br>
Yet nothing was done about it. Business as usual, you might say, but<br>
this becomes interesting when one considers that also in 1985, it was<br>
known that "[candid] awareness has long been absent from collective IRS<br>
thinking." You'd think that someone would at that point step in with a<br>
plan to revamp the system. Instead, Congress waits until 1997 to make<br>
the same useless observation, "Over the years, IRS has developed an<br>
insular culture that is often resistant to input and ideas from outside<br>
the agency--preventing leaders at the top of the organization from<br>
effecting real changes."<br>
<p>
Does the Honorable Robert Portman feel that this absolves Congress of<br>
accountability in the matter? I should say it most definitely does not.<br>
<p>
Where are the voters now? How can my vote change this? I don't think it<br>
can. If the issue is swept under the rug for 12 years, no voter has any<br>
power over it. What made Specter make his point in 1985? Letters. Enough<br>
letters to make him a bit jumpy as to his chances of reelection. "I did<br>
my part. I made a speech."<br>
<p>
Now it's a crisis and of course the politicans will capitalize on it.<br>
"We must beat this crisis! If I am elected, I will do my very best to<br>
see it through!" etc. <br>
<p>
And why can't the IRS balance its own books if they expect me to?<br>
<p>
I'm not anti-government. But this is bullshit.<br>
<p>
Let me rephrase: I'm not anti-government YET.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
<p>
