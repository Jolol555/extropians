<i> &gt; The point is you shouldn't be happy to absorb wisdom from some black</i><br>

<p>
First let me say that I misunderstood your original post, and I<br>
mostly agree with you, though I'm not sure that you're expressing<br>
your ideas in the most effective possible way (and there's nothing<br>
wrong with that, because these are inherently difficult things to<br>
talk about).<br>
<p>
But since you seem to have developed some method of judging the merit<br>
of someone's wisdom *prior* to absorbing that wisdom, I'd be *very*<br>
interested to learn of your methods, since I'm sure I could benefit<br>
tremendously from the application of these new techniques.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; It's time we simply stopped programming.</i><br>
<p>
I think we're designed to program. We can hardly help it. But we can<br>
start doing it deliberately instead of just automatically passing along<br>
whichever programs happen to have gotten their hooks into our brains<br>
before we woke up. In Leary's terminology, we can start<br>
programming and metaprogramming ourselves.<br>
<p>
And besides, programming is fun! Especially when it's collaborative<br>
and interactive.  In that form, it's often called "conversation". I<br>
dig it. It seems to be a positive-sum game.<br>
