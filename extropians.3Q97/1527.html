Not necessarily.  This fact is stated often in the press here, and stating<br>
*that fact* will make only very few call you racist.  It's the conclusions<br>
drawn from it that may draw accusations of "racist".  Yes, it could<br>
hypothetically be due to genetic differences, but it could also be due to<br>
cultural differences, or to racist behavior on the part of the criminal<br>
justice system.  <br>
<p>
You said that blacks were genetically inferior, on the basis of<br>
known-to-be-flaky IQ scores, without even citing this.  You didn't address<br>
the equally significant facts that middle-class blacks have far lower rates<br>
of violent crime and incarceration than ghetto blacks.  You didn't explain<br>
why immigrants from West Africa are indistinguishable from legal immigrants<br>
in general in terms of crime rates or income.  Nor did you address the<br>
serious research showing that the US justice system does discriminate against<br>
blacks in sentencing, particularly with respect to drug possession and petty<br>
drug dealing.  <br>

<i>&gt;What I meant was that primitive man, only just separated from the other</i><br>

<p>
If you're going to cite science to support your claims, you should do more<br>
careful research.  The first plausible hominid hunter is Homo Erectus,<br>
millions of years after the first hominid; prior hominids were<br>
(almost-?)vegetarians or scavengers.  Also, there's no evidence that any<br>
hominid prior to us hunted predators.  Some of the hypotheses for hominid<br>
hunting paint it as not too fearsome either - they hold that erectus might<br>
have just "run down" small game like antelopes by virtue of superior<br>
endurance and then clubbed them to death in their exhaustion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A theory (can't remember right now who developed it) which I</i><br>
<i>&gt;find very plausible is that certain groups of people moved for</i><br>
<i>&gt;reasons unknown out of Africa, </i><br>
<p>
The current, popular, and logical hypothesis for that is - because they<br>
could; there's a nice climactic window about 90,000 years ago.  Since we're a<br>
young species this was probably our first chance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;which at that time had a much</i><br>
<i>&gt;more pleasant climate than today, and slowly colonized the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Euro-Asian regions. They were faced by the extreme conditions</i><br>
<i>&gt;of an ice age (or several?) and had to drastically adapt in order</i><br>
<i>&gt;to survive. Only the smartest and the healthiest made it, and this</i><br>
<i>&gt;(or several) "natural selection(s)" gave the later relatives (fair skinned</i><br>
<i>&gt;etc. as an adaptation to the "polar" environment) an edge, it was</i><br>
<i>&gt;a unique evolutional boost whose fruits we still pluck today.</i><br>
<p>
OK, I'll bite.  We have lots of information on genetic differences between<br>
human population (they are small, BTW).  What are these genetic changes<br>
you're hypothesizing, and how do they affect our sociability and<br>
intelligence?  Also, what evidence do you have that Africans, evolving to<br>
deal with equally hostile environments like jungles and desert, and also the<br>
most complex, intelligence-demanding environment of all (other humans) didn't<br>
evolve improvements of their own?<br>
