In a message dated 97-07-06 18:13:07 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; in rural Washington State, every county<br>
 but I beleive King, Thurston, Pierce, and Snohomish have passed in the<br>
 past three years county ordinances requiring every homeowner to posess a<br>
 gun and ammunition. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
No kidding?  Not suprised...also not suprised I never heard about over the<br>
National media...I did hear that there was a town in Georgia that did<br>
something similar years ago...with similar results..<br>
<p>
Also heard about a study that indicated that states with "right to carry"<br>
laws had rapidly declineing violence....the predators just couldn't see<br>
attacking someone who "Might" be armed....<br>
<p>
Maybe that's the reason for the increase in violence against tourists in<br>
Florida a few years ago...Florida had recently passed a right to carry<br>
bill...Florida residents then became too risky a target...so tourists (mostly<br>
from Yankee states with restrictive gun laws) were a much safer target.<br>
