<i>&gt; Dear Michael and other fellow Extropians,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This dialogue, although quite enjoyable, seems to be going off on tangents</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the hypothetical extremes. This is not that bad, nor is it that good.</i><br>
<p>
What tangents? Every argument you have made without substantiation has<br>
been countered with statistical evidence, which you continue to ignore<br>
or constest. Is this an admittance of error or merely an aversion to<br>
confrontation?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I suspect, however, that some of us -- myself included -- might be getting</i><br>
<i>&gt; too emotionally involved and loosing our objectivity on the issue of gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; control by becoming involved in somewhat questionable exegesis.</i><br>
<p>
I'm always completely objective when it comes to free exercise of my 2nd<br>
amendment rights.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Possibly, we should further consider what is in the best interest of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; continuing  evolution of humankind and its cultures. We should consider in</i><br>
<i>&gt; this context the need for greater altruism in an enhanced humanistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; environment.</i><br>
<p>
In an enhanced humanistic environment, the sanctity of the individual<br>
would be of paramount importance. Violation of this sanctity should be<br>
met with deadly force to ensure a proper level of memetic and<br>
psychological deterrence against further encroachment by individuals,<br>
groups, and nations with little respect for the sanctity of the<br>
individual.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The political context of our dialogue as well should be strongly</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered if we are to believe that we are all capable of care and</i><br>
<i>&gt; concern for our fellow humans and respectful of their their right to seek</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual freedoms without the imposition of their personal constraints</i><br>
<i>&gt; and and other emotional burdens on other members of society.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly. The irrational fears of emotionally undeveloped individuals<br>
should not justify the imposition of constraints upon my or anyone elses<br>
freedoms, including, most importantly, the right to defend oneself<br>
against the constraints or impositions of others.<br>
<p>
<p>
