I think it would be more correct to say that the act of measuring causes<br>
the wave function collapse.  I don't think the Copenhagen interpretation<br>
itself says anything specific about consciousness.  Neither is any attempt<br>
made to define what exactly an act of measurement is.<br>
<p>
Some other physicists (I think Eugene Wigner is one of the main ones) have<br>
suggested the idea that consciousness is primary in inducing collapse.<br>
<p>
A good experiment to keep in mind is the two slit interference experiment,<br>
where measures are added to see which slot the particle goes through.<br>
When this is done, coherence is lost and the interference pattern goes<br>
away.  This happens independent of whether or not anybody actually looks<br>
at the measurements of which slit was used.  This seems inconsistent with<br>
the notion that consciousness collapses the wave function.<br>
