<i>&gt; &gt; What was a Dragon Rapide?</i><br>

<i>&gt; Ancient biplane used for some of the earliest commercial flights. I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; it was the first biplane with an enclosed cabin for passengers.</i><br>
<p>
As an indication of a plane truly mature for its flight regieme, take<br>
any of the cessna singles for their maintenance requirements.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; True commercial aircraft are extremely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reliable, but they hardly operate in a harsh flight regieme, and they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are highly overbuilt for the job.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And the 'saucers' reported by Roswell 'witnesses' aren't? (But odd that</i><br>
<i>&gt; this material which is supposedly so indestructable could be torn into</i><br>
<i>&gt; little pieces in a crash).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Still, a plane with 20,000 flight</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hours at an average of 450 mph is still brand new compared to an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; interstellar flight of 20 light years at .98 C with no maintenance</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; stops. Its a whole different universe of operation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, it is. Cruising at 0.98c is hardly a harsh flight regime if you have</i><br>
<i>&gt; a shield ahead to catch debris impacts.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, the hard radiation of impacts and dopplershift would embrittle<br>
the materials to a large extent.<br>
<p>
 After your engines shut down<br>
<i>&gt; you're simply cruising for years until you reach your destination. Landing</i><br>
<i>&gt; and take-off are also the most extreme parts of an airliner's flight</i><br>
<i>&gt; regime, but they still have to keep their engines running for the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt; trip. And, of course, the crew can't maintain the plane as it's flying,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which alien astronauts could.</i><br>
<p>
How do you stop? SOrry, you've got to turn that mutha around and brake<br>
for as long as you've been accelerating. That puts your ass end open to<br>
reentry through an alien solar systems Oort cloud.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Let's compare this to shuttle maintenance, qualitatively the closest</i><br>
<i>&gt; current approximation: the effort required to overhaul a shuttle is almost</i><br>
<i>&gt; fixed regardless of whether it's in space for two days or two weeks. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; vast majority of maintenance is related to launch and landing, which both</i><br>
<i>&gt; happen precisely once per flight. Longer flights merely require more minor</i><br>
<i>&gt; maintenance like removing more garbage, adding more fuel for the fuel</i><br>
<i>&gt; cells, greater chance of having to replace a window damaged by debris etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The second the shuttle engines ignite you're up for thousands of man-hours</i><br>
<i>&gt; of work, even if it doesn't launch.</i><br>
<p>
For starters, the shuttle orbits at a mere 17,000 mph, and it still<br>
breaks down half the time, causing the mission to be cut in half. You<br>
can't do that on an interstellar mission. "Oops, Snorf, we busted the<br>
toilet, we've gotta turn around...."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Finally, I find it highly unlikely that aliens as technologically backward</i><br>
<i>&gt; as the Roswell reports imply could travel interstellar distances in their</i><br>
<i>&gt; little saucers. Far more likely they'd be simple planetary transports</i><br>
<i>&gt; which would have been in storage until they reached Earth, then serviced</i><br>
<i>&gt; thoroughly before flight.</i><br>
<p>
Sure, so to "ensure" that they would not be worn out, an alien<br>
bureaucrat supposes, they'd be brand new. And sitting in a hanger at a<br>
standstill for several years enduring hard radiation wouldn't harm it a<br>
bit. Buddy, you are talking to someone who has worked on the best we've<br>
got, and they still wear out, and still crash. Expecting your godlike<br>
aliens to be any different is pure delusion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Well, one could say that the skunk works guys were the ones who built</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it, so that may be an advantage over using high school graduates or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; dropouts who were drafted. Plus Kelly Johnson never liked having people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; who just did heavy looking on, like so much military work is.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Precisely; and how much of the increase in maintenance on modern military</i><br>
<i>&gt; aircraft is simply an increase in the amount of 'heavy looking on', or</i><br>
<i>&gt; badly-designed maintenance programs?</i><br>
<p>
There is nothing badly designed about them. They are doing their best<br>
with what they can get. Lockheeds skunk works had a few dozen geniuses<br>
who made things work right the first time. That kind of skill is a wee<br>
precious commodity that regualr service cannot afford in any but<br>
extremely special circumstances.<br>
<p>
My first squadron, the 318th FIS in Tacoma, had 350 people covering all<br>
jobs related to running a fleet of 24 F-15A and B, except for base<br>
logistics. Of those, 30 were pilot officers, and 6 others were admin<br>
officers. The remainder were all enlisted personnel, half of which had<br>
not graduated high school before basic training (the older guys). We had<br>
the highest utilization rate in the USAF TAC the first year I was there,<br>
and had not lost a plane in over ten years (we had lost an F-106 a few<br>
months before they were retired in 1979). Our unit was deactivated in<br>
January of 1990.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ben Rich mentioned that the massive Air Force oversight to ensure that</i><br>
<i>&gt; they didn't charge for any $600 hammers greatly increased the cost of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stealth (not-)Fighter, probably by far more than corruption in the company</i><br>
<i>&gt; could have done. NASA have on occasion found tools inside a shuttle after it</i><br>
<i>&gt; returned and discovered that three inspectors all signed off the forms to</i><br>
<i>&gt; say that those tools were removed. This is why I was concentrating on</i><br>
<i>&gt; commercial aviation, where there's a great incentive to minimize the</i><br>
<i>&gt; required maintenance and oversight.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Additionally, the CIA got a new plane, while the USAF got a well used</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; plane. Maintenance time goes up with airframe age.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; AFAIK the CIA started out with the original single-seat A-12, but the USAF</i><br>
<i>&gt; bought two-seat SR-71s from Lockheed instead; I don't think that any</i><br>
<i>&gt; aircraft were transferred over, but I don't have my books handy to check.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Also, AFAIK NASA were maintaining their SR-71s with a CIA-sized crew, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; those aircraft were around twenty-five years old (although I don't think</i><br>
<i>&gt; they flew as often).</i><br>
<p>
Neither did the CIA operate the A-12 at the level the USAF did the<br>
SR-71, and half of the SRs WERE operated by the CIA prior to USAF<br>
takeover. If you'll recall, the reason they were turned over was because<br>
LBJ had announced the plane's existence (and incidentally screwing up<br>
the plane's designation), and it wouldn't look good having the CIA with<br>
its own publicly known air force.<br>
<p>
The CIA also did not have the operating environment militarily that the<br>
USAF did. By the time the USAF took over, the Soviets had developed<br>
missiles capable of catching the plane, which required the development<br>
of EW units for the plane.<br>
