I suppose that we have to be very careful with the religious, <br>
particularly christians in general,  because they really believe.. <br>
and love.. myths like Jesus, saints, angels... and also they have <br>
been thaught (programmed), counciously or not, for not liking enough <br>
the real world. Even Jesus said: "My kingdom is not in this <br>
world" and "The world will hate you and you will hate the world... " <br>
Just God or Jesus would "save" them ( from what???)  - terrible words <br>
but coherent with the judaic-chistian doctrine that assumes the <br>
existence of another world, a heaven, all happiness and good, where <br>
they were promised to go with the supposed "Good Boy"of "God Father" <br>
and...obviously no working and nothing to do ( very interesting for a <br>
lot of people  - hehehe ) excepting adoring Jesus (or God, etc.) !!! <br>
&lt; secretly: I think it is a little homossexual ... hihihi <br>
...blasphemous, impious and profane!! joking ...&gt;  Ah! and no sex : <br>
terrible... in this particular aspect I would prefer the hell, <br>
obviouoly having an important political position there...<br>
<p>
For this, they can feel sad and even get offended with the <br>
answers we give them. And we can loose the colaboration of important <br>
people... what we do not want... <br>
<p>
I have observed that there is always a diplomatic way to separating <br>
the social, etc,  from religious subjects (at least on the <br>
intelectual level of this list, obviously...). <br>
<p>
If reason marries emotion, with love, they will change lots of good<br>
experiences and effects, I observe...  (Note that we will never <br>
loose the reason...but feel better the effects of the emotional <br>
fluxes... At the end, the reason will become stronger, and the <br>
emotion kinder and better conducted, like a musical instrument, when  <br>
well played...)<br>
<p>
I think it is really better putting  the religious interpretations <br>
aside. So, the religious and believers also must try to reflect a <br>
little more and give sociological or psychological or <br>
anthropological, etc. basements  for their thoughts... <br>
since our minds are already "very grown up" and free from  <br>
impositive, superficial or just emotive "reasons" .. (not emotional, <br>
which we try to understand, explain and...feel as real "lords"), <br>
even when these reasons seem "good" (but  are "pseudogoods", we are <br>
already tired to know...). Or so, the believers will be gotten as <br>
being wrong and will not get to trasmit their   good (and really <br>
useful) messages "ocult" in their minds. Really this i's not a <br>
religion list... (Convert yourselves !!!...hehehe)<br>
<p>
Indeed, if I were from Human Sciences, I would better explore the <br>
rich experiences of mankind, developped, obviously with little or no <br>
global surety and  real basis, by religions...and try to transforming <br>
such experiences in more useful and real effects...<br>
<p>
Please let's not talk using religions....(although it is useful to <br>
analyse them, taking what is good and thashing what is bad...(and not <br>
for recycling..hehehe)).<br>
