I think that's a most important point! The idea that teaching is an<br>
effective way to learn was embodied in many private schools for the poor in<br>
19th century England. (Without digging out a copy of E.G. West's books on<br>
the history of non-government education, I don't remember the name of the<br>
schools and their founder.) Despite the poor being much poorer than today's<br>
poor, private schools were able to educate large numbers of children<br>
apparently often more effectively than today. Older children, having<br>
learned some things, would teach younger children. A chain of such<br>
instruction from most learned to least allowed a small staff of "real"<br>
teachers to instruct a large number of children. Anyone of us who have<br>
taught classes knows very well how teaching strongly encourages you to<br>
learn your topic better than you ever knew it before.<br>
<p>
I don't expect ever to see this method of learning-by-teaching used in<br>
state schools. Perhaps it will come back in a new form if the current<br>
experiments with vouchers continue to show excellent results and spread.<br>
(Note: I would prefer tax credits for education over vouchers, but the<br>
latter is still *much* better than a state monopoly.)<br>
