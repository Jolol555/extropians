I did a 1-hour show-and-tell 2 years ago when #2 kid was in<br>
5th grade. I took an old 8088-based PC in, and we demolished it.<br>
We took the disk apart ot expose the platters, pulled the cards,<br>
took chips out of sockets, and popped the chips apart to look<br>
at the silicon wafers inside. The kids loved it. That type<br>
of demolition  really apeals to 5th graders. Of course, I<br>
explained that this old computer was worthless because it<br>
was ten years old. I got in a simple explanation of<br>
exponential improvement, (Moore's Law), and I had the kids<br>
extrapolate the curve for me. I also got in a good deal of<br>
computer architecture. The teacher, and the kids, told me it<br>
was the best parent presentation of the year.<br>

Moral: you don't have to be a scientist to do this stuff.<br>
