&lt; It is funny to notice that the idea of holism is in some sense<br>

I think that second sentence, especially the "WITHOUT looking at the<br>
parts" is a VERY extreme position (what Damien Broderick recently<br>
called ‘Black Holism’).  It also seems to be the position of some<br>
mystically-inclined practitioners of systems science (c.f., the<br>
International Society for the Systems Sciences and Thomas Mandel’s<br>
essay at <a href="ftp://lumina.ucsd.edu/pub/.../lst_dir/TMandel.GenSys">ftp://lumina.ucsd.edu/pub/.../lst_dir/TMandel.GenSys</a> ).<br>
<p>
But, I also think that ‘bottom-up reductionism’ ONLY is also a fairly<br>
extreme position.  The self-organizing properties of interacting<br>
components (especially functional rather than structural aspects), the<br>
emergent "complex and abstract properties’, are not always apparent<br>
when one deals with individual components IN ISOLATION from a<br>
bottom-up approach.  It is only over time, as the models for<br>
individual components are linked and the ‘whole system’ becomes<br>
approachable that some of the more ‘global’ characteristics become<br>
visible.<br>
<p>
But maybe we’re just mixing up the empircal and theoretical approaches<br>
here.  As I quoted Peter Cariani recently: "Keep your hands wet but<br>
your mind dry".<br>
