THE "ROYALTY" ILLUSION<br>
<p>
My intention is to introduce a number of political<br>
illusions, one at a time, over a period, allowing<br>
some time between illusions for debate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From time to time I also plan to introduce other topics</i><br>
relevant to the debate.<br>
<p>
The "Royalty" Illusion refers to the illusion that certain<br>
people (sometimes said to have "blue blood") belong to a<br>
"special" class variously called "royalty," "aristocracy,"<br>
or "nobilty."<br>
<p>
"My name is Alice, so please your Majesty," said Alice very<br>
politely; but she added to herself, "Why, *they're only a<br>
pack of cards*, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!"<br>
[emphasis added]<br>
<p>
...The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring<br>
at her for a moment like a wild beast, began screaming,<br>
"Off with her head!  Off with--"<br>
<p>
"Nonsense!" said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the<br>
Queen was silent."<br>
<p>
-- Lewis Carroll, 'Alice in Wonderland'<br>
<p>
These people are supposed by some to be "royal," "noble,"<br>
or "aristocratic" because they're the offspring of a supposed<br>
"royal" or because they received a "royalty title" from a<br>
supposed "royal." <br>
<p>
In "England" (so-called) they have a "Royal Parasite List"<br>
they call the "Civil List," which is a list of the "royal"<br>
parasites and how much each gets from the "public treasury"<br>
every year.<br>
<p>
"When *I* use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather<br>
scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean --<br>
neither more nor less."<br>
<p>
"The question is," said Alice, "whether you *can* make<br>
words mean so many different things."<br>
<p>
"The question is," said Humpty Dumpty, "***which is to be<br>
master -- that's all***."  [***emphasis added]<br>
<p>
-- Lewis Carroll, 'Through the Looking-Glass'<br>
<p>
<p>
The following story may assist you to transcend this<br>
"royalty" illusion:<br>
<p>
<p>
Two Tribes<br>
----------<br>
<p>
Consider two different isolated tribes somewhere in the jungles of South<br>
America.  Call them Tribe 1 and Tribe 2.  Each has its unique language<br>
with its own structure.  The language of Tribe 1 (Language 1) tends to be<br>
very literal.  A man who fishes, for example, is called "man-who-fishes."<br>
The same man, while sleeping, is called "man-who-sleeps"; while talking,<br>
"man-who-talks"; while running, "man-who-runs"; while eating,<br>
man-who-eats"; while writing, "man-who-writes"; while making a chair,<br>
"man-who-makes-chair"; while giving orders, "man-who-gives-orders"; etc.<br>
In Language 1, distinctions are made between different kinds of words:<br>
"Thing-words," "Do-words," "How-words," "Story-words," "Funny-words,"<br>
"Order-words," "Panic-words," "What-words," "Who-words," "Why-words,"<br>
"When-words," "Where-words," etc.  High-level abstractions are rare in<br>
language 1.  To the people of Tribe 1, any word that doesn't refer to<br>
something physically perceivable, is highly suspect.  Their test for<br>
reality is *physical*.<br>
<p>
The language of Tribe 2 (Language 2) is very different.  A man who obtains<br>
his wherewithal mostly by fishing, is called "fisherman."  (This system of<br>
nomenclature would seem absurd to the people of Tribe 1 -- how can you<br>
call someone a "fisherman" when he is not fishing, but sleeping?)<br>
Language 2 contains many high-level abstractions -- like "happiness." <br>
People from Tribe 2 can talk for hours about "happiness."  (To someone<br>
from Tribe 1, this would be incomprehensible -- they only talk about<br>
"woman-who-is-happy" while she is happy, and "woman-who-is-sad" while<br>
she is sad.  The notion that you could separate "happiness" from a real <br>
person being happy, and talk about "happiness" as if it existed by itself,<br>
would be completely unthinkable to someone from Tribe 1.)<br>
<p>
To the people from Tribe 2, any word being used is automatically assumed<br>
to be part of existence, otherwise people wouldn't use it.  (To someone<br>
from Tribe 1, the word "existence" would be a meaningless absurdity,<br>
because in their mentality only particular objects exist.)  In Tribe 2,<br>
the test for reality is *agreement*.  If other people agree with a word<br>
and the way it seems to be used, then that word is automatically accepted<br>
as valid and useful.<br>
<p>
One day a strange man arrives at the place where the people of Tribe 1<br>
live.  They ask him: "Who you?"  He: "I King."  They: "Your name King?"<br>
He: "No; my name John."  They: "Why call self King if name John?"  He: "I<br>
special person, agent of God."  They: "You look different but not special;<br>
who God?"  He: "God creator of world."  They: "Where God?; How create<br>
world?"  He: "God everywhere; God all-powerful."  They: "How we see God?"<br>
He: "Can't see God."  They: "You speak crazy."  He: "No; I special; I show<br>
you."  Whereupon the stranger performs various tricks like apparently<br>
making objects appear and disappear.  They: "You clever man-who-tricks."<br>
He: "I special; I King."  They: "You speak funny; you clever John-who-tricks."<br>
He: "I King; my word law."  They: "What law? -- special word?"  He: "Yes;<br>
my word law -- you must obey."  They: "Ah!  You mean order-word!"  He:<br>
"Yes; I King; I make law."  They: "No; you speak order-word?"  He: "Yes;<br>
I special."  They: "What special? -- Anybody speak order-word?"  He:<br>
"You not understand."  They: "No."<br>
<p>
Eventually John-the-stranger gives up trying to convince the people of<br>
Tribe 1 that he has a "special status" and that his words are different<br>
from the words of anyone else -- so he leaves, to search for more gullible<br>
and impressionable victims elsewhere...<br>
<p>
For many days and nights he trudges through the jungle before discovering<br>
the people of Tribe 2.  They: "Who you?"  He: "I King."  They: "Your name<br>
King?"  He: "No, my name John."  They: "Why call self King if name John?"<br>
He: "I special person, agent of God."  They: "You look different; what<br>
God?"  He: "God creator of world."  They: Where God?; How create world?"<br>
He "God everywhere; God all-powerful."  They: "Show special?"  Whereupon<br>
the stranger performs various tricks like apparently making objects appear<br>
and disappear.  They: "You King, agent of God."  He: "Yes, my word law."<br>
They: "What law?"  He: "Law special word of God through me; you must<br>
obey."  Whereupon the people of Tribe 2 bow down and kiss the feet of John<br>
-- they do not habitually test abstractions against reality, so they<br>
readily accept John-the-stranger as their "King" and his word as "law."<br>
Thereafter all he has to do to subjugate, control, and dominate them, is<br>
open his mouth...<br>
<p>
"Language creates spooks that get into our heads and hypnotize us."<br>
<p>
-- Robert Anton Wilson , Introduction to 'The Tree of Lies'<br>
(by Christopher S. Hyatt. Ph.D.)<br>
<p>
The people from Tribe 1 reject the Slavespeak words of John the<br>
would-be-terrocrat -- making them impossible to subjugate, control, and<br>
dominate.  To them the terrocrat is merely a clever liar and trickster.<br>
<p>
The Tribe 2 people accept John's word "King" to describe himself.  They<br>
believe that "King" John has special powers because of the tricks he<br>
performs and because of his connection to "God."  By accepting John's<br>
terrocrat words they automatically place him in a superior position and<br>
themselves in inferior positions.  Just by accepting, believing, and using<br>
the terrocrat word "King," they yield their power to the terrocrat -- they<br>
subjugate themselves.<br>
<p>
It's worth emphasizing that just by accepting the concepts/words of the<br>
would-be tyrant, you place yourself at a huge disadvantage.  By doing so,<br>
you relinquish your power, enabling the would-be tyrant to become an<br>
actual tyrant.  Instead of laughing at his silly notions, you'll probably<br>
end up begging him to "change the law" so you can be free.  And guess who<br>
has the last laugh!<br>
<p>
""What's the use of their having names," the Gnat said, "if they won't<br>
answer to them?"<br>
<p>
"No use to them," said Alice; "but it's useful to the people that name<br>
them, I suppose.  If not, why do things have names at all?""<br>
<p>
-- Lewis Carroll, 'Through the Looking-Glass'<br>
<p>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Recently, on another list someone posted a message on<br>
"branding" -- a marketing term for creating and spreading<br>
an image of a person or product.  Branding is a synonym<br>
for "positioning" yourself or your product in the prospect's<br>
mind.<br>
<p>
The post on "branding" spurred me to think some new thoughts.<br>
I realized that when "royal" or "aristocratic" cheaters call<br>
themselves "king," "queen," "prince," "princess," "His/Her<br>
Royal Highness," "duke," "duchess," "lord," "earl," "lady,"<br>
etc., they're engaging in a form of "branding." Part of the<br>
brand ploy is to brand those not "royal" or "aristocratic"<br>
or "noble" (those with red blood as opposed to blue blood!)<br>
as "commonors."  So this branding ploy makes an unwarranted<br>
distinction between "aristocrats" (the supposed "nobility")<br>
and "commoners" (supposedly "common" people) and elevates<br>
"aristocrats" above "commoners" in the minds of those who<br>
"buy the brand."<br>
<p>
This branding ploy succeeds because of the gullibility<br>
of the naive who allow themselves to be branded as<br>
"commoners."  Another factor in maintaining the ploy<br>
is that most people, feeling that they lack personal<br>
exellence (maybe including the inability to think<br>
original thoughts), have to create the illusion of<br>
"special" people to put on pedestals, through which<br>
they can vicariously enjoy something "special."<br>
<p>
"She looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly<br>
wrapped herself up in wool.  Alice rubbed her eyes,<br>
and looked again.  She couldn't make out what had<br>
happened at all.  Was she in a shop?  And was that<br>
really -- was it really a sheep that was sitting on<br>
the other side of the counter?"<br>
<p>
-- Lewis Carroll, 'Through the Looking Glass'<br>
<p>
(In other words, the person you've been "illusioning"<br>
as a "Queen" is really a sheep! -- a major theme of<br>
the 'Alice Books.')<br>
<p>
A most important factor in maintaing the "nobility"<br>
branding ploy is the "quest for external authority."<br>
See 'The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown<br>
of the Bicameral Mind' by Julian Jaynes.  People<br>
who've not yet become the authorities of their own<br>
lives "need" the illusion of "external authorities."<br>
They "need" to brand themselves as "lowly commoners"<br>
who look up to and bow down to "elevated royals."<br>
<p>
The main reason for the "royal" and "aristocratic"<br>
and "noble" cheaters to practice this brand ploy is<br>
that it enables them to live like parasites off the<br>
production of others; they live in great splendour<br>
and wealth, enjoying fame and fortune, without having<br>
to work and produce for a living.<br>
<p>
I have long recognized the "royal"/"aristocratic"/<br>
"noble" illusion, though I've never cut a supposed<br>
"noble" to see whether his or her blood is blue or<br>
red.  My common sense tells me that it's extremely<br>
unlikely that these pretended "nobles" have blue<br>
blood or that they're particularly "special" or<br>
"elevated" people.<br>
<p>
But it was only after reading the branding article<br>
that I integrated the "nobility" illusion and the<br>
branding phenomenon.<br>
<p>
How difficult is it for people who unwittingly brand<br>
themselves as "commoners" to "unbrand" themselves<br>
and cure themselves from the need to vicariously<br>
experience "excellence" by branding rather common<br>
imposters, pretenders, parasites, and adulterers<br>
(even though some do perform actions of excellence<br>
from time to time) as "kings," "queens," "princes,"<br>
"princesses," etc.?<br>
<p>
The Diana phenomenon bears witness to the power of<br>
combining the "nobility" illusion with branding.<br>
Diana's brand owes its power to three further important<br>
factors: beauty, empathy, and martyrdom.  During her<br>
life she openly shared her trials and tribulations,<br>
causing people to feel empathy for her.  She also<br>
demonstrated genuine empathy for the poor, sick,<br>
and disabled.  She "touched" many people deeply.<br>
<p>
Mother Teresa also had a strong empathy brand,<br>
but she had neither the "nobility" illusion nor<br>
the beauty of Diana.  She's also not considered<br>
a martyr.<br>
<p>
In terms of attention, Diana is 100 to 1,000<br>
times as powerful as Mother Teresa.  Diana's<br>
combination of the "nobility" illusion, beauty,<br>
and empathy made her the most photographed person<br>
in life.  In death, martyrdom has added further<br>
to the attention lavished on her image (brand).<br>
<p>

PS. I would appreciate any suggestions as to what<br>
can be done to make it easier for people to grasp<br>
and overcome the "royalty" illusion.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, what can be done so that people who<br>
do grasp and overcome the "royalty" ilusion can<br>
use what they did as a model and then utilize the<br>
same model to grasp and overcome other political<br>
illusions?<br>
