<i>&gt;	The offended parties in the post human world could link up, each</i><br>
<i>&gt;contributing resources in proportion to the offense given.  They could then</i><br>
<i>&gt;reduce the offending party to raw materials.  That is unless the offending</i><br>
<i>&gt;party also had friends.  Obviously, violence is not going to work in every</i><br>
<i>&gt;case.  Therefore, polycentric law will be applied.  It will actually be the</i><br>
<i>&gt;only law that can be applied because data flow between entities is so high,</i><br>
<i>&gt;they cannot help but know what each one's goals are (probably survival and</i><br>
<i>&gt;therefore expansion, most everything else would probably be tossed).  This</i><br>
<i>&gt;means that polycentric law will actually be more like agoric computing. </i><br>
<i>&gt;One would not consider the relegation of a computer program hogging more</i><br>
<i>&gt;resources than its worth to a lower priority slot, or even deleting it, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;"capital punishment."  Executions, more properly prunings, in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;post-biological world will probably be as dramatic, and necessary, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;cutting one's toenails. </i><br>
<p>
An interesting notion. It's true, I don't wonder if my toenails have rights, <br>
nor even if an astrocytoma has rights. But astrocytomas are considered <br>
inoperable.<br>
<p>
I'm confused, though--you use the term "polycentric law" as if it had a <br>
fixed meaning, then announce what it will be "more like". Help me out, <br>
here: what are you on about? How is "polycentric law" any more principled <br>
than a kangaroo court?<br>
<p>
Apart from that, where does the notion of property rights go? "Hogging more <br>
resources than its worth"[sic]? To whom? Than whom? Them Injuns weren't <br>
*using* the prairie, they was jest a-*sittin'* on it. Pass the smallpox-<br>
infected blankets. Sarge.<br>
<p>
Sounds about as ethical as Salmonella in a petri dish.<br>
