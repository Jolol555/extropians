     Holly Pearson posed the question:<br>
     <br>
      So, are you an extro-nazi or an extro-saint?<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     My largest incongruity with the classic Extropian viewpoint (as <br>
     expressed on this digest) is a seeming lack of humanity and <br>
     connectedness.  <br>
     <br>
     Although your post has some rather intense, preachy moments and is <br>
     easily viewed as flaming by anyone with a defensive posture (and will <br>
     likely be intellecutally torn to shreads if this thread has any <br>
     staying power), I would have to agree that something will have to give <br>
     soon.<br>
     <br>
     I would like to see our combined intelligence and illumination <br>
     distributed among the masses, however unworthy or illogical that may <br>
     seem to some, rather than hoarded among the privileged few.  <br>
     <br>
     As I said to EvMick after he said he was essentially not his brother's <br>
     keeper, if someone is suffering, I am suffering.  I didn't get this <br>
     for a long time.  I'm sure many people still don't.  But we need to <br>
     start getting it in a collective way if we wish for the localized <br>
     "cancer" of our indifference not to spread to the entire global host.<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
