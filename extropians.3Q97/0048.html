<i>&gt; Or the old Procter and Gamble "moon and stars" logo, which they</i><br>

<p>
About the same time as the memestorm surrounding backward-masking of<br>
Satanic messages in popular music lyrics, and the corresponding parade<br>
of horribles marching into the minds of America's youth as a result.<br>
Additionally, Dungeons and Dragons was also the "Devil's Tool," and even<br>
Mighty Mouse was villified for "snorting" a magic "powder" that gave him<br>
super-rodential "strength." <br>
<p>
Wasn't it also about this time that Reagan proclaimed "The Year of the<br>
Bible?" <br>

<i>&gt; States.</i><br>
<p>
I'd rather it wasn't. There's nothing quite like seeing esoterica while<br>
in the shower at 6 am.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I think the ExI logo looks more like a sports franchise than a<br>
cult -- the Maelstroms or something.<br>
