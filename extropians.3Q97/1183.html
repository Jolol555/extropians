In a message dated 97-07-26 20:31:33 EDT, you write:<br>
Speaking to a  retired Guv.  (ahem) employee<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; See, the trouble with your position is this.  The money you use to do<br>
  your thing has been taken from people.  (In the best possible cases) the<br>
 thing you've done seems to have had some visible benefit; but what is<br>
 invisible is the other stuff people could have done with the money you<br>
 took off them in taxes.  Think about it. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
&lt;breaking in rudely&gt;<br>
<p>
I've thought about it.  I do think about it... I am thinking aboutl it...a<br>
lot.<br>
<p>
The guv. takes over %50 percent of my income.<br>
The guv.  restricts entry into busines by regulation.<br>
The guv thereby chokes off new jobs and increases the cost of living.<br>
<p>
At a minimium, were there no guv. meddling, I would have a minimium of<br>
four<br>
times the disposable income that I now have......I "guesstimate" that it<br>
would in reality be closer to ten times.<br>
<p>
The reasoning follows.  The industry in the US (world) which has the least<br>
amount of  Guv. meddling is the computer industry.  Ref: Moores law...You<br>
get<br>
Twice the computer for half the money every 18 months.  I take that to be<br>
the<br>
NORMAL course of events absent guv meddling.<br>
<p>
It is the birthright of everyone to acheive millionaire (billionaire)<br>
status<br>
by middle age...given a free economy.The guv ...by meddling ...is stealing<br>
our birthright and only a few manage to acheive it.<br>
<p>
<p>
Or as the guy drinking coffee two tables over said (no doubt regarding<br>
something else...but entirely appropriate none the less)..."Another<br>
Government Screw-up"....<br>

Dear EvMick and other fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
Despite my advancing years, my wrinkles, arthritis, failing eyesight and<br>
the length and whiteness of my beard, I have not yet retired from service<br>
to the the people of the State of New York and the United States. My wife<br>
has advised me that I can retire from my present position on August 2,<br>
1999. At that time I will accept an offered position and begin to teach<br>
public administration and public policy in one of the graduate schools of<br>
one of our fine regional colleges.<br>
<p>
I quite agree with you when you complain that our governmental systems are<br>
far from perfect. The number of policy statements and governmental reform<br>
legislation that I have been involved in producing to improve government<br>
operations never seems to end. That has not yet stopped me from trying to<br>
overcome the numerous constraints that are thrown in my way. <br>
<p>
I also agree with you that some of the money that goes to provide<br>
necessary government services is wasted. I don't think that taxation is<br>
extortion, however. I firmly believe that government does a lot of good<br>
and is quite capable of doing a lot more good than it does. It would<br>
certainly work a lot better if we would all put our egos in our back<br>
pockets and let those of us who have spent a lifetime studying and working<br>
at our chosen careers in professional government service trying to do our<br>
jobs despite the continuous interference of well meaning dilettants and a<br>
herd of politically and ideologically fixated ignoramusus who know little<br>
or nothing about governmental operations except how to gum up the works<br>
with unnecessary regulations and other bothersome clap-trap. <br>
<p>
For those of you who have wonderful theories on how to improve government<br>
let us see how they can be implimented for the broad common good. I've<br>
heard a good deal of criticism of government during my pre-government<br>
education and continuously during my attempts to serve the citizens who<br>
pay me a wage that is far less than I would have earned in the private<br>
sector. <br>
<p>
I have no complaints, however, about what I have been permitted to do in<br>
service for humanity, although there are many who would second guess my<br>
methods until the cows come home.      <br>
<p>
It's quite possible that some day, long after I'm gone, someone, somewhere<br>
will come up with a better and more equitable system. <br>
<p>
I'd like to be around to see that happen but although I'm optimistic about<br>
the human condition, I do not perceive any great change in the near<br>
future.<br>
<p>
Flame away to your hearts content.<br>
<p>
Enjoy!!!<br>
<p>
