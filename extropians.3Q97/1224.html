Well, I have never thought of it that way. Although I would likely be<br>
less enthusiastic about them if they were a staple (in old contracts<br>
for handymen in northern sweden there were sometimes a paragraph that<br>
saved them from having to eat salmon more than five days a week), I<br>
think the basic taste (lightly salted, with some garlic and onions,<br>
served on roast bread...) is valuable in itself. <br>
<p>
Pleasures should not be overdone, since we become habituated to them,<br>
but I prefere the possibility of indulging in them when we want (and<br>
at a reasonable price) instead of when we happen to stumble across a<br>
mushroom patch in the forest. <br>
