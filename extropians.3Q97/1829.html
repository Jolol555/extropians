That may depend on the pay-offs: is it more efficient to be darwinian<br>
than to develop using other evolutionary systems (say, cooperative<br>
lamarkianism), and does the Red Queen Hypothesis hold (if you are not<br>
developing, you will become obsolete and raw materials)?<br>
<p>
I think we can look at nature to get a first suggestion: yes, it is<br>
dawrinian (what else is new?), but that may be due to the complexity<br>
of implementing something else (Kelly suggests that evolution is also<br>
evolving). Evolution becomes nastier if the resources are more<br>
scarce. And does species compete? Yes, but only when they share the<br>
same ecological niches, otherwise they are independent or form<br>
dependency chains. So the question boils down to: will there be<br>
different ecological niches after the Singularity?<br>
<p>
I think there will be unless something goes very wrong. It may turn<br>
out that a few kinds of nanodevices are enough to turn the physical<br>
universe into a posthuman computational playground, but in the<br>
virtual world running on them new ecologies of infomorphs can<br>
develop. <br>
<p>
Resources can of course become scarce (replicators filling memory<br>
space, limited attention etc), but if we suppose that intelligent<br>
beings are responsible for setting up the basic template of the<br>
posthuman evolution it is not inconceivable that they would add some<br>
allowances to make resources grow faster than they are utilized (like<br>
the uploads did in Egan's _Permutation City_: they let their universe<br>
expand and adjusted their clock-cycles so that the amount of<br>
computing power grew quite quickly to them). <br>
<p>
Are there other ways of looking at this problem?<br>
