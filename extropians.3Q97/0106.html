<p>
Gary Kleck's study, School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Florida<br>
State University. I find that study a little dubious, but the *lowest*<br>
figure ever produced has been 60,000 crimes prevented each year. AFAIR<br>
Kleck's figure includes any instance in which the individual believed that<br>
their firearm prevented a crime, whereas the 60,000 figure was for cases<br>
where their firearm could be proven to have definitely stopped a crime. <br>
<p>
There are good reasons to believe that the true figure is somewhere in<br>
between, since individuals are likely to be overoptimistic, while the low<br>
figure was the result of a government survey and hence inevitably<br>
inaccurate since so many defensive gun uses are in themselves illegal and<br>
would not be reported. I'd be surprised if the true figure was much under <br>
a million.<br>
