Danny, work with us here, huh?  <br>
<p>
I made the original posting.  <br>
<p>
In it, I reported that an episode of the cult TV show `Millennium' had<br>
claimed that a fantastically infrequent linear alignment of seven planets<br>
would occur at that date (and dramatised the claim, allegedly showing us<br>
viewers its truth on a Net-accessed orrery).  I made my posting for two<br>
reasons:<br>
<p>
1)  While I found it extremely unlikely that such a coincidence would occur<br>
shortly, I didn't have access to any astronomical database that would help<br>
me test my doubt.  Luckily, a number of extropians did indeed provide the<br>
answer - which was, not surprisingly, that any `alignment' was so diffuse<br>
and impressionistic that the image of a string of planets stretching<br>
outward from the sun on 5/5/2000 was a blatant and misleading invention of<br>
the scriptwriters.  (Yes, it's fiction, but there's a dangerous DMZ between<br>
willing-suspension-of-disbelief and misinformation.)<br>
<p>
2)  I knew that all manner of boneheads are concocting and promulgating all<br>
manner of truly stupid memes linked to a year 2000/2001 `apocalypse'.<br>
Among these is the good old Theosophical standby about polar flipflops, but<br>
I didn't need to spell this out because everyone here is aware of the<br>
deluge of crap washing back and forth through the badly trained brains of<br>
many of the world's literate and semi-literate but essentially uneducated<br>
people.<br>
<p>
I was initially concerned, therefore, that if an astronomical coincidence<br>
of this kind was indeed due - as, it turns out, it isn't - we would be in<br>
for a rough time as the boneheads ran around in circles squealing and<br>
pointing at the sky.  Hale-Bopp beam-me-up Redivivus, big time.<br>
<p>
I did not anticipate that my sceptical scientific inquiry would start the<br>
squealing here and now *on the extropian list*.  That is, my post was not a<br>
troll.  But by golly it certainly chased some funny looking critters out<br>
from the undergrowth.  :(<br>
