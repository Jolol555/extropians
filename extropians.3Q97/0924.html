<p>
I've never worked at a company that had everything right, but a few came<br>
close.  Most of the companies that had dynamic payscales were small<br>
consulting groups and the like.  In these cases, it is actually rather<br>
obvious since the client companies can be billed for each type of task as a<br>
separate line item and rated according to market.  This makes it easier for<br>
the payroll system to reflect these changes for both direct and indirect<br>
costs.  The only negative side is that these companies tended to have a<br>
more rigid management structure and technique.<br>
<p>
One notable company for which I have worked a relatively lengthy time is<br>
Sesame Software, Inc. out of Scotts Valley, CA.  In this company the rate<br>
is usually fixed (although not always) per project and not per task.  You<br>
work when you want to and can work on pretty much any open task you want<br>
to.  Most employees can get medical and 401k, etc. even if they work on a<br>
somewhat transient basis.  Telecommuting is generally the rule.  They will<br>
gladly teach you new skills "on-the-job" if it is within the scope of what<br>
they are currently doing.  A pretty good company overall with virtually no<br>
bureaucratic heirarchy, although lately the company has been waffling a bit<br>
IMO.  I still work for them on a part-time basis.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And how was the type of work and market value determined?</i><br>
<p>
The types of work were broken down by significant category.  The software<br>
business has numerous obvious divisions.  (Java programmer, Oracle<br>
programmer, Oracle DBA, Unix C/C++, SAP programmer, NT applications, Web<br>
design, Unix TCP/IP apps, etc. )<br>
<p>
The breakdown for various projects and market value is usually negotiated<br>
between the client, the management, and the employees.  These keep the<br>
figures at a level that is somewhat average for Silicon Valley.  Most of<br>
the basic market values are arrived at over time and are adjusted<br>
occasionally to reflect the changing market for that skill.  It isn't<br>
something that changes on a weekly basis.  Usually if one asks around, they<br>
can get a feel for the going price for a particular skill.<br>
