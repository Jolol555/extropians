<p>
OK, a clarification. What you refer to is likely Tierra, where long <br>
initial organisms evolve into shorter organisms due to competition for<br>
scarce memory. I was referring to commonly used GA algorithms (the<br>
Lisp-like trees invented by Koza), where there usually are no size<br>
constraints. <br>
<p>
If you make small programs more fit, small programs will evolve, but<br>
if you keep the size contraint they will not evolve well (that needs<br>
a large genome/code). So a better solution is to first evolve big and<br>
baroque programs, and then make size more and more relevant, creating<br>
shorter, less correct but more efficient programs. I read<br>
some amazing results where they got 2-3 instruction programs that solved<br>
a myoelectrical pattern recognition problem rather well this way! Of<br>
course, in the case of immune systems you would not care much about the<br>
code size. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Building a nuke: you need around 10 kilograms of uranium 235 (or whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; isotope it was). There is around 2 grams uranium / tonne in the crust of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; earth, of which 0.72% is U235, so to get 10 kg you need to process around</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 7000 tonnes of crust. I'm not sure how much energy is required to reduce</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the UO2 to pure U, but it is a noticeable amount (are there a chemist</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in the house?). Assuming the nanites cover a large patch with solar</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; collectors, they can get around 500 W/m^2, which has to cover their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; replication, search through the crust, reduction, isotope separation and return</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to the "base"; how much energy this is is a bit hard to tell right now</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (it is 1.30 in the morning here :-), but it looks like it will take</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a while for the bomb-mold to blow up. A wild guess would be around a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; week.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, there's a couple of questions I'd pose about nuclear nanotech:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1)  Can mini-assemblers build mini-thermonuclear devices?  If you have 10</i><br>
<i>&gt; grams instead of kilograms, but you still put the deuterium at the center and</i><br>
<i>&gt; jacket with U-238, could you get the same effect?  What about custom-assembled</i><br>
<i>&gt; crystals that will collapse easily and tightly... maybe laced with water to</i><br>
<i>&gt; slow neutrons down?</i><br>
<p>
No. A fission bomb is based on the creation of a critical mass, where the<br>
growth of neutron flux due to fission is larger than the loss into the <br>
surroundings. Unless nanotech could build a neutron reflector (which I<br>
doubt is physically possible?) it would still need several kilograms of<br>
fissible material. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2)  What about direct fusion devices?  Inertial confinement would be my guess.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Take the deuterium and imprison it inside a fullerene-bracketed block of</i><br>
<i>&gt; diamond, then apply a large energy pulse, perhaps from an enormously efficient</i><br>
<i>&gt; quantum-well laser.</i><br>
<p>
Doesn't sound very likely, although I'm more iffy on the physics here. First,<br>
the entire structure would have to be macroscopic in order to do any damage,<br>
so there is no real need to use fancy fullerenes to keep the hydrogen in.<br>
And you would need to store enough energy for the laser, and somehow compress<br>
almost all of the hydrogen, not just a small pellet (ah, thats the problem!)<br>
which seems to be nearly impossible to do using laser light. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3)  Given either of the two above, could you build a REALLY HUGE thermonuclear</i><br>
<i>&gt; bomb, perhaps by surrounding the item with a huge U-238 crystal?  Direct the</i><br>
<i>&gt; blast in a specific direction using the properties of crystals, maybe with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bit of quantum mechanics mixed in?  Use the blast to pump a graser?</i><br>
<p>
Well, you could always pile up as much U and deuterium as you wanted around<br>
it. The extra U would not really do much except make it dirtier (it will<br>
mainly be blown away by the explosion instead of fissioned), but the<br>
deuterium would add to the blast (that is why you can make fusion bombs<br>
as large as you want). <br>
<p>
Directed nuclear explosions doesn't sound likely, since at present we<br>
are relying on random nuclear fission with no preferred direction. If<br>
we could make neutron mirrors things might get different. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In other words, nanotechnology operates as close to the level of nuclear</i><br>
<i>&gt; reactions as we operate to the level of chemical explosives.  I can't help but</i><br>
<i>&gt; think that there will be similar improvements in technology.</i><br>
<p>
That is likely, if there is an interest. But remember that nanotech isn't<br>
much closer to the nuclear level than we are - it still cannot interface<br>
directly with it, just move the atoms around. There are fundamental<br>
physical problems here we need to look into to get the nano-nukes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Doing the same work as a nuke with nanites (i.e. disassembling everything</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; within a few hundred meters and blasting everything within a few kilometers)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is rather tricky, since it is extremely energy intensive. You need plenty</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of energy to do the disassembly (essentially you have to break most molecular</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bonds), and nanites are bad at making blast waves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't see why.  First of all, they'll be able to construct explosives</i><br>
<i>&gt; completely to order.</i><br>
<p>
But where does the energy in the explosives come from? Remember conservation<br>
of energy - when you make explosives you have to add energy beside the<br>
chemical energy of the raw material to make the energetic but unstable<br>
TNT molecules (electrical energy -&gt; chemical energy). The same is true for<br>
the nanites - if they want to turn a lawn into a bomb, they need more<br>
energy than will be released in the eventual blast. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm far from an expert on explosives... but couldn't you get a bit of an</i><br>
<i>&gt; improvement by detonating the ENTIRE bomb with electronic synchronization, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the entire blast arrives time-on-target?  A shock wave is just that, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; wave.  So modern TNT is a huge splash made up a lot of little uncoordinated</i><br>
<i>&gt; splashes, while nanotech TNT is the precisely synchronized sum of all those</i><br>
<i>&gt; splashes.  Almost exactly like the distinction between a light bulb and a laser.</i><br>
<p>
I think something like this is done already, although not with the nano<br>
precision you suggest. You might improve the current state a bit, but it<br>
is likely not a quantum leap. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Again, I'm trying to point out that a bit of</i><br>
<i>&gt; imagination is necessary to see the enormous destructive potentials here.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think we can safely extrapolate a *little* bit beyond current capabilities. </i><br>
<p>
What I am trying to do is theoretical applied science - using known laws<br>
of physics to discuss what can and cannot be done. You can always say that<br>
unknown quantum effects will circumvent all that, but it is an empty<br>
speculation until you show that these unknown effects really do exist. <br>
Note that we should speculate beyond current *capabilities*, not current<br>
*physics*. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Most of what you're saying has nanotech being less dangerous than modern</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology.  I can't help but compare this to the old saw about "Atomic</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology may someday equal the capabilities of present bombs, but it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; unlikely to produce anything more dangerous."  [Paraphrase.]</i><br>
<p>
Well, if that turns out to be history's judgement on my part in this thread,<br>
so be it. But remember, there were people expecting a cure for the common<br>
cold in the early 70's too...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Ever thought about the fact that the immune system isn't mutually supporting?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is rather a balance of predators which do not predate on each other since</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that destroys their fitness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Interrogative?  Expand, please.</i><br>
<p>
I would like to get some expert in on this, since my medical knowledge is<br>
more neuroscientific than immunological (I'm not an immunologist, I just<br>
pretend on the net :-). Basically, the immune system is programmed to<br>
destroy, destroy, destroy - everything. But during the complex process<br>
where white blood cells are bred the cells that would kill unsuitable<br>
things (like each other, the body etc) are weeded out, as are the "meek"<br>
cells. The rest are just barely tamed, and will with no hesitation destroy<br>
any cell that doesn't show the right antigens, and everything in the<br>
vicinity. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Good guys will be motivated to contemplate directed evolution since the bad guys</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; do it; and they tend to have more brainpower and money on their side. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; think the weapon of openness is important here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It could go either way.  Maybe the bad guys kidnap all the scientists and then</i><br>
<i>&gt; use pain-center stimulation to achieve faster results.  Idealism may win</i><br>
<i>&gt; battles and break ties, but it is not a defense to be trusted.</i><br>
<p>
Or maybe the good guys spread a nanite which give all bad guys migraine<br>
when they think evil thoughts. Get real, this sort of unrealistic Hollywood<br>
speculations is the last thing we need ("... if you do that, I'll send in<br>
my *dragons*!" "Ha! I have an army of invisible pink unicorns that will<br>
eat your dragons!").<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Alternatively, it might only have to take over a single power base.  Your</i><br>
<i>&gt; question assumes that the goo, once detected, is doomed.  My version assumes</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the goo, once established, is undefeatable.  This is pretty much what</i><br>
<i>&gt; we're arguing.</i><br>
<p>
It seems so. But as others have pointed out, your claim that destruction is<br>
fundamentally more efficient than creation suggests that if I know about<br>
your goo I can destroy it. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How can I make quantitative comparisions between systems that don't exist? </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm just trying to point out the qualitative causal forces at work.  When</i><br>
<i>&gt; we're finished cataloguing, we could try to set up a quantitative comparision,</i><br>
<i>&gt; bearing in mind that it would be utterly false-to-fact and useful only for</i><br>
<i>&gt; speculative purposes.</i><br>
<p>
We can't do any cataloguing based on a priori ideas (qualitative causal forces),<br>
we need something more solid than that. I prefer theoretical applied science,<br>
it allows us to compare not-yet-existing systems. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The body is surrounded by an inert skin (say diamond);</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Isn't diamond something that can be set on fire at sufficient temperatures? </i><br>
<p>
Yes, but so is almost everything. I never said I would sketch an <br>
*invulnerable* system, just a sufficiently strong system. For any immense<br>
shielding I can come up with you could always invoke an even greater <br>
cosmological disaster ("But your immune system can't stand a supernova!").<br>
This exercise is trying to look at defenses against gray goo, which<br>
is the real problem, not macro-level warfare. <br>
<p>
Diamond is an useful start, but as an outer skin I would actually use something<br>
more inert.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Isn't the crystal fragile when properly angled forces are directed against it?</i><br>
<p>
This is a mere matter of design, I don't think diamond crystal is the best<br>
way to go, more likely a flexible matrix of jointed diamondoids. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  How much of an insulator is it for temperature?  What about gamma rays?</i><br>
<p>
It conducts heat well, and as far as I know is transparent for gamma rays.<br>
But you are not seriously suggesting grey goo radiating gamma rays?<br>
(that would BTW be very bad for the goo too, since nanites are radiation<br>
sensitive; and I could have radiation shielding in the skin while the<br>
goo would be unprotected (since grey goo carrying around lead is easy<br>
to find and exterminate by taking it away)).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; attempts to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; physically breach it can be detected from the inside and the surrounding</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; region sealed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sealed by what?  If it's better than diamond, why not surround the whole body</i><br>
<i>&gt; with it?  If the sealant is worse than diamond, or is diamond, why wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything capable of penetrating the external wall go right through the sealant?</i><br>
<p>
Diamond does quite nicely here, although even more inert materials would<br>
do better. The breaches can be of two kinds, a strong<br>
external force making its way in, and in that case we are talking about<br>
macro level defense and offense again, or nanites forcing their way through<br>
the walls. In the later case, they would need energy to breach the<br>
walls if they are inert, and it would be exothermic for the defenders to<br>
thicken their walls. If they turned the surrounding compartments into<br>
a "diamondoid scar" the energy in the infected compartment would not<br>
be enough to breach the barrier, and the whole infection would require<br>
a lot of external support (which could be broken). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What detector mechanism are you using?  Can I falsely trigger it over the</i><br>
<i>&gt; entire body, thus making the "detector" useless and redundant?</i><br>
<p>
I have been thinking of having nanometer "pipes" criss-crossing the barrier, <br>
containing linear molecules which break or vibrate when interfered with. You <br>
cannot detect them from the outside (just diamond, and then an opening - <br>
oops!), and the signal into the compartment will give information about <br>
where something is going on. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If sealed-off</i><br>
<i>&gt; areas are easier to attack, wouldn't the false alarm let me peel off an entire</i><br>
<i>&gt; layer?  And why couldn't I just repeat the action until you were the size of</i><br>
<i>&gt; an apple core?</i><br>
<p>
Sounds like something that could be designed away. OK, I haven't yet<br>
tried to sketch how the control systems ought to look (I haven't got the<br>
time even for doing this discussion properly! :-( ). The software<br>
part is of course even more important than the hardware part.<br>
<p>
But basically, if you trigger all the surface cells, don't you think the<br>
system will immediately (assuming some intelligence somewhere) guess<br>
the strategy? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The rest of the organism (could be a transhuman, factory</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; or a city) is compartmentalized with similar walls; infected sections</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; can be isolated.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Okay, so you've made the problem of immunity recursive on immunity for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; single section.  This may actually be an excellent plan of defense, allowing</i><br>
<i>&gt; for partial breaches and reserves.  But a design for an immune system it's not.</i><br>
<p>
It is a partial solution, and makes the problem more manageable. The body<br>
uses something fairly similar with its internal barriers (it is surprising<br>
how strong the blood-brain barrier is, even adrenaline can't get through!).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Okay, I see a trend developing in your plan.  Detection is the important</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing; it's assumed that pockets of infection, once detected, can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; obliterated.  Very much like the human immune system.  But if viruses could</i><br>
<i>&gt; outfight white blood cells, we'd be dead.  I'll conceed that fooling detection</i><br>
<i>&gt; might be made difficult, almost impossible, through the use of digital</i><br>
<i>&gt; signatures.  But again - how do you keep a single cell from being penetrated? </i><br>
<i>&gt; Once a cell is penetrated, you destroy it - but does the destruction keep the</i><br>
<i>&gt; infection from spreading?  A single spore might be defeated by this strategy. </i><br>
<i>&gt; A sea of gray goo won't be.</i><br>
<p>
A sea of gray goo is also a macro-level problem. It is obvious, it can<br>
be fought on the macro level (meaning that human or transhuman intelligence<br>
have the time and space to implement defenses not just based on what their<br>
ordinary immune systems can do, but also their other available resources). <br>
For example, it wouldn't appear impossible to nanofacture "antibodies",<br>
very simple nanites which disrupt the goo nanites, en masse once the goo<br>
is understood. <br>
<p>
I have noticed that your approach seems to be that when subtle attacks<br>
doesn't work, you invoke maximum overkill instead. But that takes a lot<br>
of resources, and can often be disrupted more easily than a subtle attack<br>
(compare "AAARGH! The goo has my password!" to "Ouch, this goo is corrosive,<br>
let's wash it away in a shower of hydrogen peroxide"). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No comment.  Part of it isn't very complicated, given digital signatures. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nor, as far as I know, can a nanotech penetrate a wall invisibly.  I'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; concede you perfect detection.  For this discussion, it's the fight I care about.</i><br>
<p>
Thank you. Let's go down to the real battle - dismantling nanites. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  As far as I can tell, your strategy simply lets</i><br>
<i>&gt; me destroy your entire complex cell by cell.  Penetrate a cell, watch it go up</i><br>
<i>&gt; in flame... repeat.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, like Stalingrad? ;-) You assume that the destroyed cell will no<br>
longer be a problem. But what if it turned into a cube of inert diamondoid?<br>
Then it would also be a hinder, and give me even more time to develop<br>
countermeasures. <br>
<p>
I see that I have been a bit too defensive (I usually am in strategy),<br>
since you are right in that just slowing the advance of the goo won't<br>
win the fight. So, to get back to how the body works, I'll better<br>
develop antibodies and macrophages. <br>
<p>
An antibody would be a very simple device that sabotages a certain nanite.<br>
It could be a molecule that binds and then tends to stick to other<br>
antibodies, trapping the goo nanites as dimers or polymers. A macrophage is<br>
simply a selective disassebler, which destroys a certain kind of nanite<br>
or structure. Assuming I have detected the infection the next step would<br>
be to make antibodies and macrophages against it, and start spreading them.<br>
Note that they would be produced faster than the goo since the goo would<br>
have to both reproduce, breach security and defend itself while the <br>
antibodies and macrophages would just be produced (although a goo-like<br>
macrophage is an interesting and dangerous concept) and sent on their way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The real obvious one is this.  Your immune system - any immune system</i><br>
<i>&gt; conceived along these lines - requires that two nanosystems fight each other</i><br>
<i>&gt; to a standstill.  If two nanosystems fight and destroy each other, then any</i><br>
<i>&gt; city in an island of gray goo is doomed.</i><br>
<p>
I think you are thinking too much of ants fighting here. I see it more<br>
as chemistry, especially protein interactions. It is much easier to make<br>
something which binds goo into an inert mass than to build a goo eater.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The goo simply makes repeated</i><br>
<i>&gt; attacks, and each time, the city shrinks a little.  We won't even speak of</i><br>
<i>&gt; such horrors as cutting off that city's solar power.</i><br>
<p>
An isolated immune system in a world where nobody else has immune systems<br>
is weaker than a system in a world where nanodefenses are common. The ultimate<br>
defense would of course be to have immune systems everywhere, defending<br>
not just the transhumans but the himalayas, squirrels and grass. A bit like<br>
the current state in biology, really.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; In short, the immune system requires that *defense* have an advantage over</i><br>
<i>&gt; *offense*.  I can conceive of any number of ways that this could happen.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; shall now proceed to list them.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, this is the crux. I contend that defense is easier. <br>
<p>
[Some good examples deleted for brevity; I get the impression we are<br>
discussing nano-sized knights fighting on the battlements of a transhuman<br>
city :-)]<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Moravec has a great discussion of exotic forms of matter(1).  "Higgsium" is</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1e18 times as dense as water; "Monopolium" is 1e25 times as dense.  My</i><br>
<i>&gt; impression was that Higgsium might be hard to penetrate, even using Higgsium</i><br>
<i>&gt; projectiles; only Monopolium would suffice.  With Higgsium and without</i><br>
<i>&gt; Monopolium, then, any area taken might be easy to hold onto.  With Monopolium,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the reverse is true.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Similarly - and here I speculate without knowledge - there might be a way to</i><br>
<i>&gt; give a material an unbreakable "quantum surface tension".  Or subbaryonic</i><br>
<i>&gt; picotechnology - "chromatic technology" - might use "quark barriers", surfaces</i><br>
<i>&gt; as unbreakable as a proton.  (From what I know of quantum chromodynamics, this</i><br>
<i>&gt; is incredibly unlikely.  The bubble would have to be pushed out by truly</i><br>
<i>&gt; inconceivable forces; pre-Plank-time Big-Bang-type forces.  But hey, what do I know?)</i><br>
<p>
OK, but at this level I simply escape into my own basement universe (Mitch<br>
suggested that you could even hide backdoor wormholes inside atoms for <br>
unexpected ambushes). Dragons vs. invisible pink unicorns again? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Then there's the simple possibility, dependent on molecular details of which I</i><br>
<i>&gt; know nothing, that defense on the molecular level has an innate advantage over</i><br>
<i>&gt; offense.  Certain molecules or nano-screens might simply be easier to form</i><br>
<i>&gt; than to break, just like atoms or quarks.</i><br>
<p>
Good point. There are certainly some molecules which are much easier to<br>
break than to form, and hence allows me to make good detection systems or<br>
nanites whose programming is erased if they are opened. I think there might<br>
be some structures which are very troublesome to destroy on the nano level.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nanosystems are always faced with "destruction by induction".  That is, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; can always destroy one cell; therefore you can destroy the whole thing.  To</i><br>
<i>&gt; defend against this, it is required that the system expand faster than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; destruction OR that it be impossible to destroy one cell.</i><br>
<p>
Or that you can make the loss of a finite number of cells bearable. If their<br>
loss removes the threat (for example by forming a nanoscar), then the<br>
defense side will win. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Speaking of escape, there's another workaround for "destruction by induction".</i><br>
<i>&gt;  If you run into space, the gray goo might hurl itself after you, but it won't</i><br>
<i>&gt; have the overwhelming resources required for "destruction by induction".  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; addition, the effort of destruction might simply provide the city with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; velocity boost.  Certainly things in space will be different than on the ground.</i><br>
<p>
Another good point. While I believe in active shields, space is IMHO the only<br>
really proven form of defense against goo. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So there are a lot of immune systems, just as there are many forms of attack. </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's just that defense being favored over attack requires too much exotic</i><br>

Hmm, we still disagree. I don't see why you have to invoke exotic technology<br>
for this. But I think we have touched on some of the most important<br>

to get some real nanotechnologists, immunologists and strategists into<br>
this discussion. <br>
