<i>&gt; &gt;EvMick, the claim "I don't know where to find it" on the internet is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;about the most lame excuse an individual can make in this life. About as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;bad as claiming to not know how to wipe one's own nose, or other bodily</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;parts. I'll bet you that there isn't one subject that is on the web that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I can't find with a search engine of my choice.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I assume that everyone is intelligent.  If they're ignorant, I teach</i><br>
<i>&gt; them.  If they're afraid, I encourage them.  If they're lazy, I hang</i><br>
<i>&gt; out a carrot if I care, and ignore them if I don't.  In no case do I</i><br>
<i>&gt; insult them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Here's my "one-stop shop" of choice:  <a href="http://www.albany.net/allinone/">http://www.albany.net/allinone/</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; Unlike the Yellow Pages, if you can't find it there, maybe it really</i><br>
<i>&gt; _doesn't_ exist.</i><br>
<p>
Joao deserves insults.  He is not merely ignorant, he is willfully<br>
ignorant; he /has/ been pointed to sources of information (I pointed<br>
to some myself), and he chose to waste our time instead.  That's not<br>
just ignorant, that's rude.  I can respect someone who has spent<br>
some time studying and thinking about an issue who then argues with<br>
me, but not someone who doesn't want to learn, and who just wants to<br>
hear his prejudices validated.<br>
<p>
For the record, I find that "HotBot" generally provides better hits<br>
on general searches, but fewer of them (which is good), so I use it<br>
most of the time.  But following links from related pages is even<br>
better when you have a good starting point, like extropy.org.<br>
