Remember what the first step must accomplish.  It must lift the NSPIC from<br>
<p>
the minds of those who enforce the NSPIC.  It's slow work!<br>
<p>
<p>
Almost everybody enforces NSPIC.  I find it really amazing that most people<br>
don't realize they're doing it.  That makes NSPIC self-enforcing.  It's not a<br>
matter of people at the top of a heiarchy enforcing it, but a matter of<br>
everybody doing it to each other.<br>
<p>
I agree. I think this is even more important when you consider<br>
<p>
how many "adults" have the intellectual capacity of a 10-year old.<br>
<p>
If we want civilization to *seriously* extropically evolve, it will require<br>
<p>
having a larger number of people (dare I say "mainstream populace?")<br>
<p>
gaining a greater understanding of the types of things discussed on this<br>
list.<br>

How many people on this list saw the episode of "King of the Hill" where<br>
Peggy has to teach a sex-ed class?  What amazed me about this episode was the<br>
topic of the average person's ignorance was explored on a mainstream<br>
television show.<br>
<p>
If this can't be done the destruction of Ingrid will cause terrible loss<br>
<p>
and retribution.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you are implying that this list isn't up to communicating</i><br>
<p>
through my<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;AI, called Ingrid, then I would really appreciate being put in</i><br>
<p>
touch<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;with one that could.</i><br>
<p>
What is "Ingrid"?<br>
<p>
<p>
The time required to implement AND to identify the barriers to<br>
<p>
understanding NSPIC AND <br>
<p>
to outline the benefits gained from understanding and transcending NSPIC<br>
<p>
IS BEST <br>
<p>
SERVED BY identification of a series of steps to transcend NSPIC USING<br>
<p>
the Freeware <br>
<p>
called The Ingrid Thought Processor. <br>
<p>
Again, what the hell is Ingrid?  Someone also briefly mentioned that it<br>
wasn't available for the Mac.  Why are a lot of people on this list so<br>
wrapped up with it?<br>
<p>
We have a list policy against debating "the basics", and it sounds like<br>
<p>
Legg and Burt are interested in supporting government intervention in<br>
<p>
private business relationships.  We just got finished with a round of this<br>
<p>
with our Dutch friends, but at least they were reasonably open-minded.<br>
<p>
Reading the rants of Burt and Legg makes me doubt that there is much<br>
<p>
chance of a satisfactory outcome.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>

<p>
So far, the debate seems to be getting off track.  I'm beginning to wonder if<br>
something useful will come out of it.<br>
