<i>&gt;</i><br>
I didn't say I don't believe them - I haven't really made up my mind on<br>
the matter.  I used to believe it more than I do now.  But lately, I<br>
have come to believe that psychedelics just give you a whole load of<br>
what I call 'meaning hallucinations' - i.e. under their influence, your<br>
brain generates all kinds of significances, meanings, etc., to try and<br>
explain to itself what the fuck is going on.  Now perhaps *some* of<br>
those meanings have some basis in reality, and perhaps even point to<br>
some weird shit's being true.  But there's nothing in the experience<br>
itself - nothing in *any* experience -  it seems to me, that guarantees<br>
its own truth, that wears its truth on it's face, so to speak. <br>
Experiences must be matched against each other, tested against each<br>
other, before you can hope to come close to the truth.<br>
<p>
Now, I enjoy my experiences as a kind of 'trip', really just a sort of<br>
roller coaster ride, in which I get all sorts of notions.  I don't take<br>
any of them seriously *at the time*; if any of them stand out, I note<br>
them for when I'm straight, and test them when I'm straight, against my<br>
accumulated experience, and the accumulated, tested  experience of<br>
humanity in general (science).<br>
<p>
I'm not totally hostile to such notions as you put forth.  In fact, one<br>
of my favourites (going back to the McKenna thing) is the notion that<br>
psylocybin mushrooms are a kind of travelling alien entity.  It kind of<br>
makes sense in an Extropian context, that genuine ETs might not look at<br>
all like what we would expect them to look like, and their technology<br>
might appear incomprehensible to us.  In an Extropian context, you could<br>
say that perhaps psychedelic mushrooms are a Power!<br>
<p>
My worry was that you just seem to be a wee bit hostile to, and<br>
uncomprehending of, science.  You see, it's not that scientists are<br>
trying to spoil anything or get one over on you, it's that they want to<br>
get things right, and the best way to do that is to test, criticise, and<br>
test again. This may *seem* destructive, but in the end, it is<br>
destructive only of falsehood. <br>
