EvMick (quoting a website):<br>
<i>&gt;Socialization, in this respect, becomes submitting one's will to that of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the group (or person in charge).</i><br>
<p>
Socialization never becomes anything other than what it is:  a form <br>
of conditioning into the cultural norms of a given society.  One can <br>
be socialized into the cultural norm of a respect for authority, but <br>
this occurs both within families and within schools simultaneously.  <br>
If anything, the family unit utilizes a more authoritarian structure of <br>
authority than the school environment as a whole.  Children spend <br>
much of their early lives being socialized into heirarchical<br>
structures, of which the school is only one.<br>
<p>
I do not have an opinion for or against home schooling, but I hope that <br>
this discussion of it will involve a clear understanding of the <br>
social phenonemons involved.<br>
