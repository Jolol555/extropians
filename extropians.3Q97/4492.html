Dear Bates,<br>
<p>
I was delighted with your piece on Lord Rees-Mogg and his American associate,<br>
James Dale Davidson, which you posted today to list prj@mail.msen.com.  Keep<br>
on digging, and eventually you and Lloyd Miller will understand what I am<br>
talking about.<br>
<p>
Their book, "The Great Awakening," contains the only up to date profile of<br>
the U.S. and U.K. price indexes that I have seen since the October 1966 issue<br>
of FORTUNE magazine put the U.S. Consumer Price Index (!889 to 1966) on a<br>
center-fold page of an article on inflation by Glbert Burck.  That great<br>
macro-indicator of national progress (the CPI), together with the writings of<br>
Sidney Fine 1956, Lady Rhys Williams 1943, Bertrand Russell 1915, and Henry<br>
Carter Adams 1887 persuaded me in 1969 that every principle on which the<br>
United States was founded is being willfully, deliberately, and<br>
systematically destroyed by the combined effects of the selfish public<br>
policies enforced by businessmen of the John D. Rockefeller generation, and,<br>
the ideologies of refugees from Central Europe, excepting only W. Ropke.  The<br>
trouble is, that the distruction begins at the bottom of society and works<br>
its way up, so the trends remain transparent to the intellectually gifted<br>
members of society, until it is too late.<br>
<p>
My Not So Humble Opinion, NSHO, of the only proper opinion for a WASP, or any<br>
other human being who does not regard humanity as his natural prey.<br>
