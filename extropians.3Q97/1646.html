Great thread; we should all be able to share some positive actions<br>
we can take in our lives.<br>
<p>
On the intellectual side, I left my job as a computer programmer to start<br>
my own business<br>
as a web developer and tech writer. There was nothing "extropic" about<br>
my job, except the fact that I would never break more than around $100000<br>
a year...being on my own has brought in a lot less money in the short term<br>
but I am hopeful that it will pay off in the long run. It has also allowed<br>
me to <br>
go all around the world (speaking at Internet World) and expose myself<br>
(ahem)<br>
to a lot of new ideas and cultures. I've studied a number of mnemonics; one<br>
in <br>
particular is very useful for memorizing long strings of numbers (oxymoron<br>
there). <br>
I've also studied (legitimate) lightning math methods to increase my<br>
calculation speed.<br>
<p>
On the physical side, I began a workout regimen working out three times a<br>
week<br>
and inline skating every night. I have found this to reduce the amount of<br>
sleep I need<br>
and greatly improve my awareness and lucidity in the morning. I've shifted<br>
the meat<br>
portion of my diet down to about 10%, which I feel is good enough for jazz.<br>
I've also <br>
been practicing a breathing exercise designed to increase lung capacity.<br>
It's a very <br>
unscientific test, but the best evidence of its success was a trip to<br>
Colorado. On a previous<br>
visit, I was left wheezing and light headed at the top of Pike's Peak. This<br>
time, I felt almost<br>
no effects. I've studied the martial arts, in the form of Kenpo, a Chinese<br>
rooted art with <br>
some American accents. I still have a long way to go towards the physical<br>
condition that <br>
is my goal, but I feel that I'm headed in the right direction.<br>
<p>
On the spiritual (or, if you prefer, emotional) side, I've made it a point<br>
to carefully balance<br>
my work life with my personal life. I am driven to an almost manic degree,<br>
like many people<br>
in my generation. I can easily code for 18 hours straight without looking<br>
up. This lead to <br>
poor diet, little exercise, and my 18 month old son hardly recognizing me<br>
when I came through<br>
the door. While this might benefit my professional life in the short term,<br>
it destroys me in the <br>
long term, in every way. I've had to come to two realizations: sometimes<br>
somebody else has<br>
to get the work done, and sometimes the work just has to wait.<br>
<p>
If anyone has some input, here are some of the things (self-extropy wise)<br>
that I'm researching:<br>
<p>
sensory enhancement (visual, auditory, etc.)<br>
memory enhancement (always)<br>
<p>
meditiation - I should say that I've looked a little at the psychophysical<br>
side of Hinduism. One of the principles of meditation (at least as it has<br>
been explained to this novice) is locking out sensory inputs one by one,<br>
and then locking out internal sensory inputs until there is utter silence<br>
"in your head". I've never been able to experience anything remotely<br>
approaching silence in that manner. It seems that that would be something<br>
useful to have to "purge the buffer", so to speak.<br>
<p>
Anyway, enough rambling on this end.<br>

<i>&gt; I've been self-reflecting a lot lately (summer job lifeguarding -- lotsa</i><br>
<i>&gt; time to think) and I have a "simple" question for all extropians:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What changes in your personal lifestyle have you taken to increase the</i><br>
<i>&gt; amount of extropy therein (changes = mental, physical, social, etc.)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or if not changes, per se, what have you always been doing to effect the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same end?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm most interested in ideas and insight into self-improvement from list</i><br>
<i>&gt; members' personal experiences.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thanks,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
