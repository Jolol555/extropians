Ok, here's Brazel's original testimony (for those who've avoided the issue<br>
so far, Brazel is the rancher who found the 'alien debris') from the<br>
Roswell Daily Record archive at:<br>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.sierra-vista.com/roswell/rancher.html">http://www.sierra-vista.com/roswell/rancher.html</a><br>
<p>
Now remember, this is testimony direct from another of the Roswell<br>
Industry's main witnesses... without Brazel and Marcel (the Air Force<br>
officer who later collected the 'alien debris') there would be no story. <br>

                         Harassed Rancher Who Located 'Saucer' Sorry He Told<br>
                                  About It<br>
<p>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
W. W. Brazel, 48, Lincoln county rancher living 30 miles south of Corona,<br>
today told his story of finding what the army at first described as a flying<br>
disk, but the publicity which attended his find caused him to add that if he<br>
ever found anything else short of a bomb, he sure wasn't going to say<br>
anything about it.<br>
<p>
Brazel was brought here late yesterday by W. E. Whitmore, of radio station<br>
KGFL, had his picture taken and gave an interview to the Record and Jason<br>
Kellahin, sent here from the Albuquerque bureau of the Associated Press to<br>
cover the story. The picture he posed for was sent out over AP telephoto<br>
wire sending machine specially set up in the Record office by R. D. Adair,<br>
AP wire chief sent here from Albuquerque for the sole purpose of getting out<br>
his picture and that of sheriff George Wilcox, to whom Brazel originally<br>
gave the information of his find.<br>
<p>
Brazel related that on June 14 he and an 8-year old son, Vernon, were about<br>
7 or 8 miles from the ranch house of the J. B. Foster ranch, which he<br>
operates, when they came upon a large area of bright wreckage made up on<br>
rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks.<br>
<p>
At the time Brazel was in a hurry to get his round made and he did not pay<br>
much attention to it. But he did remark about what he had seen and on July 4<br>
he, his wife, Vernon and a daughter, Betty, age 14, went back to the spot<br>
and gathered up quite a bit of the debris.<br>
<p>
The next day he first heard about the flying disks, and he wondered if what<br>
he had found might be the remnants of one of these.<br>
<p>
Monday he came to town to sell some wool and while here he went to see<br>
sheriff George Wilcox and "whispered kinda confidential like" that he might<br>
have found a flying disk.<br>
<p>
Wilcox got in touch with the Roswell Army Air Field and Maj. Jesse A. Marcel<br>
and a man in plain clothes accompanied him home, where they picked up the<br>
rest of the pieces of the "disk" and went to his home to try to reconstruct<br>
it.<br>
<p>
According to Brazel they simply could not reconstruct it at all. They tried<br>
to make a kite out of it, but could not do that and could not find any way<br>
to put it back together so that it could fit.<br>
<p>
Then Major Marcel brought it to Roswell and that was the last he heard of it<br>
until the story broke that he had found a flying disk.<br>
<p>
Brazel said that he did not see it fall from the sky and did not see it<br>
before it was torn up, so he did not know the size or shape it might have<br>
been, but he thought it might have been about as large as a table top. The<br>
balloon which held it up, if that was how it worked, must have been about 12<br>
feet long, he felt, measuring the distance by the size of the room in which<br>
he sat. The rubber was smoky gray in color and scattered over an area about<br>
200 yards in diameter.<br>
<p>
When the debris was gathered up the tinfoil, paper, tape, and sticks made a<br>
bundle about three feet long and 7 or 8 inches thick, while the rubber made<br>
a bundle about 18 or 20 inches long and about 8 inches thick. In all, he<br>
estimated, the entire lot would have weighed maybe five pounds.<br>
<p>
There was no sign of any metal in the area which might have been used for an<br>
engine and no sign of any propellers of any kind, although at least one<br>
paper fin had been glued onto some of the tinfoil.<br>
<p>
There were no words to be found anywhere on the instrument, although there<br>
were letters on some of the parts. Considerable scotch tape and some tape<br>
with flowers printed upon it had been used in the construction.<br>
 <br>
No strings or wire were to be found but there were some eyelets in the paper<br>
to indicate that some sort of attachment may have been used.<br>
<p>
Brazel said that he had previously found two weather observation balloons on<br>
the ranch, but that what he found this time did not in any way resemble<br>
either of these.<br>
<p>
"I am sure that what I found was not any weather observation balloon," he<br>
said. "But if I find anything else besides a bomb they are going to have a<br>
hard time getting me to say anything about it."<br>

<p>
So, in other words, the famous 'flying disk' was made from "rubber strips,<br>
tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks", held together by "considerable<br>
scotch tape and some tape with flowers printed upon it" (the latter oddly<br>
reminiscent of the flowery tape which was used on the Mogul balloons) and<br>
"there were letters on some of the parts". The only debatable section is<br>
at the very end; I'm not sure how similar the Mogul balloons were to a<br>
standard weather balloon. <br>
<p>
Now, tell me how many self-respecting aliens are going to fly across the<br>
galaxy in a 'flying disk' held together by *scotch tape*? And when did <br>
they build a scotch tape factory on Zeta Reticuli?<br>
<p>
Note that most of the Roswell Industry's later reports claim the 'alien<br>
wreckage' crashed between July 2nd and July 4th. Brazel's find occured on<br>
*June 14th* ... and was so unremarkable that they didn't bother going back<br>
to look at it for *three weeks*!!!!! Clearly Brazel's find, *the only<br>
documented find at Roswell* could not be related to those reported crashes<br>
unless the saucer hovered around for three weeks before finally crashing. <br>
<p>
BTW, the infamous picture of Marcel with the debris he recovered from <br>
the ranch is available at:<br>

Unfortunately the link for the full-size image doesn't work; I've mailed <br>
them about it so hopefully they'll fix it soon.<br>
