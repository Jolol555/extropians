I'm noticing an upsurge of this kind of questioning lately -- perhaps a<br>
consequence of X3, which reminded folks that transhumanism is as much like<br>
a fledgling community as it is a conversation.  Nicholas Bostrom's<br>
question as to whether it is an occupational hazard of extropianism to<br>
expect the future to be interesting in ways we like is another variant.  I<br>
think there are lots of folks at present who expect a strange future on<br>
the horizon, and lots of kindred spirits among those who relish the<br>
unexpected strangenesses of the present-day.  Of these people I have in<br>
mind the folks who litter the hallways of my Department at Berkeley, the<br>
queer theorists, multiculturalists, poststructuralists, and the like (I<br>
think Nietzsche was the first serious theorist of the singularity). <br>
Despite rough affinities, though, there is definitely a difference that<br>
makes a difference.  The spirit of rolling up shirtsleeves and grappling<br>
with problems and possibilities, perhaps?  I am loath to think of<br>
extropianism as a "movement" (movements don't have a particularly<br>
attractive track record in the twentieth century really), but there is a<br>
flavor to conversation in these fora that you simply can't find anywhere<br>
else.  I wonder, is extropianism just libertarian-inflected technophilia,<br>
or more?  Is it a foretaste of what societies may come to look like once<br>
the specters of death and conspicuous scarcities are finally trashed for<br>
good?  Is this just a place where likeminded folks come for the waters? <br>
Discussions of the desirability of an extropian political party a few<br>
weeks back had me wondering just what kind of agenda could a group like<br>
this intelligibly agree to.  Expedite the arrival of the singularity<br>
(whatever that might be)?  Bring on the demise of the nation-state? <br>
Frustrate the surge of religious fundamentalisms?  What?  Best, Dale<br>
