I'm not entirely sure what you mean here, but I don't consider filtering<br>
rude at all; this is why I've tried to ensure that the Roswell posts were<br>
clearly marked so that people could filter them out. <br>
<p>
As for requesting that people end threads, that doesn't seem like a bad<br>
idea if it isn't of general interest; I don't plan to continue discussing<br>
the Roswell crash both because of that and because I've said just about<br>
everything I have to say (though I may comment some more on the<br>
interstellar travel subthread). <br>
