<i>&gt; This is the current state of affairs (by the Sandberg Invisible</i><br>
<i>&gt; Meta-Hand Theory of Political Economy):</i><br>
<p>
[YES! I finally got a theory named after myself! :-)]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now we find ourselves deep in modernist political thought. You left open</i><br>
<i>&gt; the possibility that maximal economic growth may indeed be the same as</i><br>
<i>&gt; maximal human happiness.</i><br>
<p>
In fact, if one considers economic growth as the growth of information<br>
(since economics is essentially information processing, as argued by<br>
Tipler and others), then we might have a maximum of information production<br>
too. So it seems that it at least leaves room for growth and diversity<br>
of happiness, seen from a suffiently long distance. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Will there come a point in time when owning property becomes obsolete</i><br>
<i>&gt; and there is not even a perceived link between wealth and happiness?</i><br>
<p>
Owning property, at least in the material sense, will become obsolete<br>
once it can be manufactured or emulated so easily that there is no<br>
point in hoarding it. Just look at how ordinary pens tend to wander around,<br>
they are so cheap that nobody cares if I happen to take one with me<br>
(ah, I see I have a DoubleTree Hotel pen on my desk! I wonder how it<br>
got here...?). People only get irritated when they need their pens or<br>
when the acto of taking them clearly infringes on their territoriality.<br>
Now imagine the same thing with other material stuff in a nanotech <br>
economy. Still, rare or necessary stuff will likely remain in the<br>
ownership sphere. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is there one thing that will make everyone happy, and if so, how do we</i><br>
<i>&gt; maximize it? </i><br>
<p>
I'm not even sure there is a single way to make a person happy by <br>
activating parts of the brain, let alone by outside acts and objects.<br>
I think the answer to this is question is no, but maybe it is because<br>
we have not yet discovered the tribbles. <br>
