But they essentially eliminate property by making it sentient; anyone in<br>
the Culture can own anything non-sentient if they persuade something to<br>
make it for them. As I see it, they're just less attached to property,<br>
since they know that they can always build a replacement for anything they<br>
lose or give away. <br>

His latest Culture novel ('Excession') is based around this; a Culture<br>
scout-ship discovers an alien artifact which is doing things which Culture<br>
science believes to be impossible... what happens in such a 'nice'<br>
conflict-free, society where anyone can have anything they want when they<br>
suddenly have a unique object to fight over? <br>
<p>
It's not as much fun as some of his other books and far less coherent, <br>
but it's the first to concentrate on the AIs rather than organics, touches <br>
on the Culture's decision to avoid the Singularity, and shows that he <br>
understands the issues. Plus he includes uploading, identity transfer,<br>
backups etc for the first time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Culture books are not hard SF, and don't try to be. </i><br>
<p>
But OTOH it's not soggy SF; it does stay within its own rules. I think his<br>
main attraction is that he understands the potential power of advanced<br>
technologies. 'The State Of The Art' -- in which a Culture scout-ship<br>
discovers Earth in 1977 -- blows away most other alien contact stories,<br>
particularly movies like 'Independence Day', or, god forbid, Star Trek;<br>
the question is not whether the Culture can come in and take over -- the<br>
scout-ship alone could easily defeat the combined military might of Earth<br>
-- but whether they have the moral right to do so... <br>
<p>
Or, in other words, I think he's well worth reading, even if you don't think <br>
the Culture is a plausible society 8-).<br>
