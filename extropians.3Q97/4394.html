Dear Friends on Burt's List<br>
<p>
I have been known to make sport of juvenile smart-asses who use their quick<br>
wit, extensive vocabulary, and advanced education to blow smoke in the<br>
public's eyes about the general welfare of my country.  But that is a<br>
counter-productive activity which tends to make a gentleman mean.  Better to<br>
leave the bastards twisting in the wind of the public opinion they stir up,<br>
until they learn how to play with a full deck.<br>
<p>
Every mail list I have visited since joining AOL in December 1994 has had a<br>
small contingent of regular posters who began their two-phase human<br>
life-cycle as fully developed consenting adults, know only their "present<br>
condition," and worry only about how well off they will be in the retirement<br>
phase of their life-cycle.  This contingent appears to be oblivious of the<br>
fact that the great majority of the population begin their three-phase<br>
life-cycle as helpless dependents of their parents and their community and<br>
continue in that helpless dependent mode for 15 to 27 years, depending on<br>
whether they drop out of school or go on to get their Ph. D. in<br>
psycho-babble.  The fact that a 15 to 27 year period of sustained investment<br>
in each person is required before that person enters the productive phase of<br>
the human life-cycle is never acknowledged by the gay, lesbian, celibate,<br>
elderly, and wealthy members of the fortunate contingent who arrived at their<br>
"present condition" as fully developed consenting adults, secure in their<br>
belief that "Do what thou wilt is the whole of the law."<br>
<p>
Among the 59 posts in my 97-09-25 mail box at 10:46 hours, the 35 posts from<br>
list extropians@extropy.org included two useful posts from Anders Sandberg<br>
and Keith M. Elis on sigmoid curves, which Keith Elis knows as "S" curves<br>
representing a "mere step in the evolution of technology," while Anders<br>
Sandberg made the point "that technological development as a whole also<br>
likely forms a sigmoid."  Now that's a smart Swede!  Both points of view are<br>
useful for defining what in hell is being debated under that teflon topic<br>
that Mr. F. Mann called NSPIC, which I understand is concerned with the<br>
causes of a decline in the "state of the art" of a technology, a corporation,<br>
or a society after the sigmoid curve has reached its highest value and the<br>
next sigmoid curve fails to appear on time.  <br>
<p>
A recent thread on one of the lists, I forget which one, discussed "Memory<br>
Loss" or the mechanism of LOSING GROUND , as Charles Murray might have put<br>
it, which could have been linked to NSPIC but the authors did not make the<br>
connection, unfortunately.  <br>
<p>
My contribution, if any, to this debate reflects the fact that I am a 73 year<br>
old Life Member of the IEEE with a BSME from a co-op college and issued<br>
patents in electronic circuits, cosine-correction of photo-cell surfaces, and<br>
geographically distributed computing-control systems, and that I had never<br>
heard of a sigmoid curve until Mr. Sandberg mentioned it.  I knew them as<br>
"bumpless transitions," or "S" paths between two conditions of a<br>
servo-mechanism, as in gun-fire control and other forms of automation, or as<br>
THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION, as Karl Polanyi described the advent of market<br>
capitalism in his 1944 book of that title.<br>
<p>
In a few more years I won't give a rat's ass whether Americans were able to<br>
change course by open public debate or needed a reign of terror.  The fact<br>
remains that the sigmoid curve for the United Kingdom topped out around 1914<br>
and the sigmoid curve (measured as GNP/capita) for the United States topped<br>
our at 171% of Swiss around 1949 and has since declined to 70% of the Swiss<br>
GNP/capita.  Where will our next sigmoid curve come from?  Wanna try New Age<br>
Science Fiction psycho-babble and oil lamps, instead of electric power?<br>
<p>
If we think of HISTORY AS A SYSTEM, following the concepts of Jose' Ortega y<br>
Gasset's 1940 book of that title, human development is one long string of<br>
sigmoid curves separated occasionally by dark ages of one kind or another<br>
when mankind forgot the "Laws of Nature and of Nature's God."  Of course<br>
there are always those people who didn't get the word, and never got out of<br>
the dark ages.  We call them third world countries.<br>
<p>
If we could only discuss the problem in open public debate, that would be<br>
"bootstrapping at its finest," according to Keith Elis.  Let's try again!<br>
