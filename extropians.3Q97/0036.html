John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt; continued:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; All models are abstract.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, in a way I agree with you.  But your missing the real<br>
issue I'm trying to point out.  If one set of physical phenomenon,<br>
like transistors, magnetic memory, wires, and such are organized in<br>
such a way that they model 700 nm light reflecting off a surface it is<br>
not identically and fundamentally "like" the actual physical<br>
phenomenon.  Another set of identical physical phenomenon is much more<br>
like it than something that is merely abstractly like it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What about the difference between reading text on my cathode ray</i><br>
<i>&gt; tube and reading it on yours, would that make it different text and</i><br>
<i>&gt; a different post?</i><br>
<p>
	If we had identical CRTs and computers, and our brains used<br>
the same qualia to represent the information being displayed, our<br>
subjective experiences would be much more alike than if you or I used<br>
a different quale to represent the text that was being displayed on<br>
our screens.  If my brain used a different color quale to represent<br>
the text it would be a different experience, though the behavior and<br>
understanding about the contents of the text may be the same.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My post does not need to be precisely the same for it to be my</i><br>
<i>&gt; post. My uploaded brain would not need to be precisely the same for</i><br>
<i>&gt; it to be me, some aspects of my brain are not important, like its</i><br>
<i>&gt; color or taste or the sound it would make when dropped from a 5</i><br>
<i>&gt; story building.</i><br>
<p>
	Abstractly or behaviorally speaking, yes.  But if you are<br>
interested in the precise subjective experience and what it is really<br>
consciously like, the particular qualia used, and what it is like,<br>
does make a difference.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If the value of a bit was determined by the way it was represented</i><br>
<i>&gt; then the concept of "bit" would be completely useless. The computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; revelation started when people discovered this is not true and</i><br>
<i>&gt; information exists independent of the thing that represents it.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes!  Abstraction and independence of the particular physical<br>
representation are very powerful computational and modeling notions.<br>
But this has become one of the issues that is blinding us from being<br>
able to discover precisely what consciousness is and what it is made<br>
of.  It is blinding us to the important issue of what consciousness is<br>
fundamentally like, as opposed to what it merely represents.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When we look at a color we feel a lot of pleasure or a little</i><br>
<i>&gt; pleasure or no pleasure at all. I don't know how many levels the</i><br>
<i>&gt; human mind needs but I'll bet a 32 bit number could cover it.</i><br>
<p>
	No disagreement here.  Color detecting machines are much<br>
better than we are at detecting and representing what color things<br>
are.  I completely agree that all emotions can also be accurately<br>
represented by sufficiently complex abstract machines.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't see how any sensation can be anything but " completely</i><br>
<i>&gt; abstract"</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, red is not physically anything like 700 nm wavelength<br>
electromagnetic radiation.  It only abstractly represents it.  But<br>
then 700 nm light, or an abstract 32 bit number stored in an array of<br>
transistors, isn't anything like red either.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm totally confused why you equate abstract with valueless.</i><br>
<p>
	Phenomenal joys have intrinsic value.  They are what give<br>
things value in life.  Actually experiencing a stunning sunrise has<br>
much more value than just abstractly reading about it or representing<br>
such in an abstract virtual reality computer.  Until it is represented<br>
and experienced by phenomenal and glorious qualia it has no real<br>
intrinsic value.  That is why computer motivation has to be<br>
laboriously and complexly programmed while our representations give us<br>
simple, direct, intrinsic, natural, and much more robust motivations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I discovered a new color then my understanding of red would</i><br>
<i>&gt; change too, into something much richer.</i><br>
<p>
	I simply don't agree with you here.  Red is and always will be<br>
red.  Just like gold will always be gold and always has been gold no<br>
matter how many more elements we have and will discover and/or<br>
synthetically produce.  Discovering or producing a new element has no<br>
effect on what gold is like.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Are you claiming that your subjective experience would be identical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; since your behavior could be identical whether you wear color</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; inverting glasses or not?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes, if I wore the glasses from birth. I can't prove it but I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; convinced that's true.</i><br>
<p>
	You can't YET prove it.  When we achieve the ability to freely<br>
manipulate significant portions of the brain and thereby the resulting<br>
consciousness this kind of understanding will become inevitable.  We<br>
will know for sure who's theories more closely predict what we will be<br>
able to do and understand.  One of us will eventually be convinced<br>
that we were wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Then I don't have knowledge of anything. I thought I "knew" that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; earth went around the sun and the moon went around the earth but I</i><br>
<i>&gt; am not the earth, I am not the sun and I am not the moon.</i><br>
<p>
	Your still missing the point.  You have phenomenal models in<br>
your consciousness that are little round phenomenal earths, suns, and<br>
moons that go around each other in your brain.  But again, that real<br>
moon up in the sky and beyond your senses is not fundamentally like<br>
your subjective and phenomenal representation of that moon that is<br>
produced by your optic neurons, in your consciousness, when you look<br>
at it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do you just mean subjective experience? If not can you give me a</i><br>
<i>&gt; specific example of "non abstract knowledge"?</i><br>
<p>
	If there is precisely the same subjective qualia representing<br>
text on a cathode ray tube in my consciousness to that which is<br>
representing the same text in your consciousness then we have more<br>
than "abstract" knowledge about what that qualia is consciously like.<br>
Your and my experience would be the same, not merely an abstract model<br>
of each other.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Because the only tool we have to investigate consciousness, or even</i><br>
<i>&gt; determine that any exists other than our own, is behavior, if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; reject that you have nothing left.</i><br>
<p>
	No, we have much more than that.  All I must do is reproduce<br>
the same sensations in your consciousness in order for me to "eff"<br>
them.  I will say: "Feel this, this is what salt tastes like to me."<br>
Once you feel how salt tastes like to me you will know how it is and<br>
isn't like what you use to represent a salty taste just as you know<br>
salt doesn't taste anything like sugar or any other sensation.  Since<br>
your understanding of the physics will be so thorough and reproducible<br>
in your own mind, you will know that there is no other possibility but<br>
that that is how salt tastes for me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If it accurately predicts behavior that would be good enough for me,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but not you, you want more proof but you will never get it. How will</i><br>
<i>&gt; you ever know if your theory accurately predicts subjective</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience when you have no way of independently knowing what that</i><br>
<i>&gt; subjective experience is?</i><br>
<p>
	and<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How on Earth could we ever know that?</i><br>
<p>
	When we thoroughly understand the physics involved and<br>
objectively watch the neural corelate in our own brain and see how<br>
they precisely map to and predict the feelings we feel, the subjective<br>
will be objectively verified and we will have effing capability.  It's<br>
simply a matter of self calibration, and eventual expansion of our<br>
conscious worlds using these new laws of phenomenally conscious<br>
physics.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If true then you can be certain it is NOT the same sensation because</i><br>
<i>&gt; it can not possibly be the identical neural correlate, they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; different brains, and in your same post you said " Only identical</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical phenomenon can perfectly model every single quality and</i><br>
<i>&gt; attribute of another."</i><br>
<p>
	I admit that sensations are complex and intermixed with and<br>
interdependent of each other in the spirit world of our consciousness.<br>
This is one of the problems with understanding all this.  But, my<br>
theory or prediction is, that there are some fundamental physical<br>
phenomenon that each of our brains use, possibly in subtly and even<br>
occasionally grossly different ways, to build our conscious worlds of<br>
awareness just as the complex and diverse world beyond our senses is<br>
constructed of the basic physical elements in the periodic table.  Red<br>
is forever red and no other sensation is like it just like gold is<br>
forever gold and no other element is like it.<br>
