You could also kidnap poor folks, check their health and bloodgroup<br>
(throw the sick ones away), and keep them locked up with good wholesome<br>
food to eat and enough exercise etc, and when you find a<br>
customer, you select the closest match from your collection and harvest<br>
the organ(s) of choice. Ideally you could time it so that as many organs<br>
as possible can be sold from one person (for example the liver, kidneys<br>
and heart), although this is unlikely. The rest could be used for other<br>
purposes, like dog food. If your clients are rich and desperate enough,<br>
this *might* be a profitable business ;))<br>
