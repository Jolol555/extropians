<i>&gt;We have never had the chance to live in an anarchy, just varying</i><br>
<i>&gt;levels of authoritarianism, monarchy, and mass tyranny. That the</i><br>
<i>&gt;majority seem to prefer to live as cattle is disturbing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Well said. In a sense, what I was saying is that we are living in <br>
anarchy right now. It's just that <br>
'those-group-of-people-who-armed-themselves' have taken over everything <br>
in the intervening 6-10,000 yrs.  But as YakWax pointed out in a recent <br>
post, if we can achieve true anarchy today, we are better equipped to <br>
sustain it than previous generations.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Curious.  Tell me how a small-time operator in 1919, when there was</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; little or no access to telephones, radio, TV or big-town newspapers,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; would find the time take on the herculean task of mounting a public</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; opinion campaign against Rockefeller?  He would surely go out of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; business in the process.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You don't seem to know much about the period. Phones were widespread</i><br>
<i>&gt;(and there was even competition in that market!) and every town had a</i><br>
<i>&gt;newspaper that was the primary source of information, not nationwide</i><br>
<i>&gt;talkshows or corporate faux journalism like most people waste their </i><br>
time<br>
<i>&gt;on today.</i><br>
<p>
I'll just say here, that although phones were available they were not <br>
widespread.  It wasn't until after WWII that phones saturated the middle <br>
and lower income households.  Yes, they didn't have mainstream media (a <br>
blessing in many ways), but a necessary evil I think, in order to reach <br>
a wide-enough audience sufficient to take on Rockefeller...<br>
<p>
I have learned a lot on this thread from yourself and others.  Your <br>
arguments have been appreciated!  Thanks.<br>
<p>
