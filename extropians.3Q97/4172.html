Hi everyone,<br>
<p>
Sorry for dropping-out on all the threads like that, some family and other<br>
personal business has come up so I won't be able to participate in the<br>
contructive thread Anders started (I am by now several days minus on<br>
sleep). I've glanced over the replies and so far I think that we maybe much<br>
more in agreement than I previously thought, we just label things differently.<br>
We want the same. We just differ a bit about the road to take, we'll work<br>
it out.<br>
Thanks Anders.<br>
<p>
And thankyou all for your patience with my somewhat off-topis posts, and<br>
for all the new knowledge that has come my way in the last 2 months.<br>
<p>
I'll be back on the list actively in 10-14 planetary rotations (I hope).<br>
<p>
Warm regards to you all,<br>
<p>
Arjen<br>

                      intelligent people and the affection of children,<br>
