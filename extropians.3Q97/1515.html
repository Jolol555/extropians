Wasn't it he who first pointed out that memetics was a meme too? <br>

<p>
Counterexample: Kilroy was here. Was started by some soldiers, and<br>
was so efficient that it spread across most of the western culture.<br>
<p>
There are plenty of memes not invented by the rich and powerful which<br>
spread well, but the rich and powerful can of course support memes<br>
more effectively (broadcasting is very useful). <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Contrary to popular Extropian thought, then, the meme's</i><br>

<i>&gt; resources available for propagating the new meme. </i><br>
<p>
No. Let's make a BOTE mathematical model for memetic spread in a very<br>
large population (assumed infinite in this case). Let x(t) be the<br>
number of people infected with the meme at time t. They infect other<br>
people at a constant rate k. There is also some agency which spreads<br>
the meme deliberately, infecting new hosts at a rate l. Assume that<br>
infections last for life. Then we get the differential equation:<br>
<p>
x'(t)= kx(t)+l<br>
<p>
This has the solution x(t)=c exp(kt) + (l/k). Note that the first<br>
term, corresponding to the exponential spread of the meme<br>
person-to-person will overrun the second corresponding to outside<br>
insertion quite quickly. <br>
