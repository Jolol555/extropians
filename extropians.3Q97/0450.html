No, it just makes it somewhat less likely. See below.<br>

The problem is that to build a matter compiler you will likely need<br>
self replication. I'm not 100% sure it is mentioned in Stephenson's<br>
book (likely at the scene where Hackworth makes the Primer), but to<br>
build a macro-object you need a large field of nanoassemblers (which<br>
likely put it together using recursive assembly). How do you build<br>
such a field? The most likely explanation is that it is built by<br>
nanodevices; by assumption the assemblers are able to build most<br>
molecular structures, nanodevices included, and would hence be a<br>
cost-effective method of making assembler-fields; making each<br>
assembler-field using bulk technology would make MCs prohibitively<br>
expensive.<br>
<p>
So, we have self-replicating nanodevices (assembler-fields) anyway.<br>
In the book is it very likely that the designs for them are not in<br>
the public domain and only used by the manufacturers of MCs, but it<br>
is not a perfect protection against runaway replicators. Stephenson<br>
simply ignores this problem, but it is clear that in order to get a<br>
widely usable, cheap nanotechnology you need replicating assemblers<br>
if only in the factory. <br>
