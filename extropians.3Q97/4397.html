In chapter 2, the recruiting sargent makes it quite clear that all<br>
service is military and all recruits are subject to military<br>
discipline. Non-combat jobs are specifically described as messy,<br>
dangerous, and boring. Later, they mention that since absolutely<br>
every mentally competent person can volunteer and must be accepted for<br>
service, they will create an appropriately messy, dangerous and<br>
boring job if necessary. The example was of a blind parapelegic<br>
being given the job of serving as an experimental subject for<br>
drugs, as I recall. In Carls. case Military R&amp;D on Pluto was<br>
considered dangerous. Carl was eventually killed in a bug raid on<br>
the lab, but the inference was that the labe was a harsh boring<br>
environment with few amenities.<br>
