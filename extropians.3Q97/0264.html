<i>       &gt;One can observe one's own  feelings, but one cannot do so objectively         </i><br>
                              <br>
<p>
If "Objective" means independent of any observer, then feelings can never be  <br>
objective or even exist. If "objective" means the way things really are, <br>
then I can observe feelings objectively because MY feeling can never be <br>
anything but the way they seem to me. I would even say that if I can observe <br>
a  being's feelings objectively then I am that being, and if I can't then <br>
I'm not. That's not to say that my idea about why I have the emotion I do is  <br>
objective, it's not, and is in fact very often wrong.<br>
<p>
Some drugs have the embarrassing side affect of making us irritable. I take  <br>
such a drug and am now filled with anger. My brain needs to find a reason,  <br>
any reason, to explain this anger. Well... it must be because you're looking  <br>
at me funny, yeah that's it! At the time It seems to make perfect sense, <br>
after all, I am angry and I think you did glance at me once. I think it was  <br>
you.<br>
<p>
In this example my theory on the fundamental cause of my anger was untrue and  <br>
not objective in the slightest, but of one thing I was objective about,  <br>
the fact that I was angry, no doubt about it.<br>

And you say I'm being too pessimistic. Science is logical, if consciousness <br>
is not then Science can't help us understand it. I also don't see how <br>
consciousness could help us understand Science, yet it does. I think.        <br>

DNA is a Digital code of base 4, if it has the knowledge to produce  <br>
consciousness then it must be a Digital phenomenon.<br>
