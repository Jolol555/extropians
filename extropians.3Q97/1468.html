Many writers of the secular/humanist variety are dedicated to such<br>
conventional ideals as unselfishness and sacrifice.  In some cases,<br>
that may be why they are able to devote so much energy to the efforts<br>
which have brought them to your attention.  Of course, they are "only<br>
human", and so they have more personal goals as well, but they often<br>
view these as flaws, and aspire to identify more with the group's goals<br>
than with their own individual ones.  To them, cryonics is a crime of<br>
the highest order.  By striving to avoid death, the great leveler,<br>
practitioners are in effect setting themselves above the rest of human<br>
society.<br>
<p>
The result is that the typical secular humanist is one of the least likely<br>
candidates for cryonics.  This would apply to Asimov and Sagan in the<br>
list above.  I seem to recall some claims that Feynman was skeptical about<br>
the workability of the idea.  (If true, as one of the founders of the idea<br>
of nanotechnology this should give us all pause.)  Clarke does not come<br>
across as a bleeding-heart liberal like Asimov, so I don't know what his<br>
thoughts would be about it.<br>
