<i> &gt; Discrimination 2---comparing looks and memes and concluding that</i><br>
<i> &gt; they're different, and depending on the standards you use, that</i><br>
<i> &gt; some are better than others (superior/inferior if you will). It</i><br>
<i> &gt; can sometimes be observed that a certain meme occurs more frequently</i><br>
<i> &gt; in (a) certain group(s) of people who clearly (looks, geography</i><br>
<i> &gt; etc) share the same genetic background. Now if this meme happens</i><br>
<i> &gt; to be bad by the particular standards that you use this means that</i><br>
<i> &gt; in this field at least certain (genetic) groups as a whole will</i><br>
<i> &gt; rank lower on your scale than certain other (genetic) groups. This</i><br>
<i> &gt; could be called "scientifically based racism".</i><br>
<p>
No, it could not. There's nothing even remotely scientific about<br>
pretending to be able to "measure" the quality of a meme or a<br>
meme-complex. You think people are getting angry with you because<br>
you are espousing unpopular political opinions, but what's making<br>
me angry with you is that you are dressing up your political opinions<br>
as if they were somehow "scientific". If you start talking about<br>
"if this meme happens to be bad by the particular standards that<br>
you use", then you are no longer talking about science. Heck, just<br>
talking about correlations between meme-tag Y and gene-tag X is<br>
getting you into shaky territory as far as statistical methodology<br>
is concerned. These are fertile fields for personal opinion and<br>
individual action, but to pretend that this is presently a domain<br>
of science is just symptomatic of your attempt to hitch your memes<br>
onto the coattails of science, the better to market them to others.<br>
I'm not buying.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Of course, in everyday interaction each person should be judged</i><br>
<i> &gt; seperately, and not be unduely stereotyped, yet this is exactly</i><br>
<i> &gt; what those (alledgedly) well-meaning anti-racists ("equalists")</i><br>
<i> &gt; are doing; if you're branded a racist (iow *dared* to say something</i><br>
<i> &gt; negative about a race (other than Caucasians) and negroes in</i><br>
<i> &gt; particular than automatically everything you say (on whatever topic)</i><br>
<i> &gt; will be deemed crap and those kind, peaceful and tolerant people</i><br>
<i> &gt; all of a sudden turn out to be not-so-kind, tolerant &amp; peaceful at</i><br>
<i> &gt; all. It appears they have plenty of exceptions to their general</i><br>
<i> &gt; "humanistic" rule...</i><br>
<p>
People get to use their own filters on what other people have to<br>
say. Why you think that this is somehow "unhumanist" I don't know.<br>
Do you think we should each keep our ears constantly tuned to the<br>
voices of all six billion human beings? (Not as if this is possible<br>
or anything.) You're peddling a simplified meme-filter, and yet<br>
you whine and complain about how other people are filtering out<br>
*your* memes in a simplified fashion.<br>
<p>
Kindness is necessarily limited: you can't be kind to six billion<br>
people at once (most of the time). There's nothing unpeaceful about<br>
people not wanting to listen to what you have to say. There's<br>
nothing intolerant about it either. No one here is trying to shut<br>
you up, so stop trying to present yourself as more persecuted than<br>
you are. This is exactly the sort of self-presentation as a "victim"<br>
that I'd expect someone espousing the views you are espousing to<br>
shun.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; All very understandable of course. Man, having evolved from an</i><br>
<i> &gt; upright killer ape, couldn't have lost his violent primal urges</i><br>
<i> &gt; overnight (on an evolutionary timescale). They're still in there,</i><br>
<i> &gt; often well hidden and carefully suppressed, but there nonetheless.</i><br>
<i> &gt; The "peaceful" hippy/liberal/humanist way is probably a very</i><br>
<i> &gt; unnatural state of being for an originally agressive and opportu-</i><br>
<i> &gt; nistic creature like man. That's why communes etc. seldom work.</i><br>
<p>
Communes seldom work because communes frequently attempt to do<br>
away with private property, an institution which is far more<br>
useful as a means of social organization than most people<br>
realize. I'm skeptical of your claim that "peacefulness" is one<br>
of the *reasons* why communes seldom work.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Btw, you should see the movie "The Forbidden Planet" (60's I reckon).</i><br>
<i> &gt; It shows what could happen to a (extropian-esque) society when it</i><br>
<i> &gt; loses touch with (or: denies) it's more primitive side. Although</i><br>
<i> &gt; the movie isn't much as a whole (though mildly entertaining), the</i><br>
<i> &gt; point is clear for those who want to see it.  Denial killed the</i><br>
<i> &gt; cat.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, yes, collectivism was at one point in human cultural<br>
evolution a good computational shortcut. That's why there is so<br>
much collectivism to be found in many of the older cultures. But<br>
I just don't think you're going to have much success peddling<br>
your updated "scientific" groupthink on this list. And I'm not<br>
sure why you're trying. What exactly are you trying to<br>
accomplish with this line of argument? What changes would you<br>
like to bring about by presenting this information?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Your black neigbor may very well be your mental equal/superior,</i><br>
<i> &gt; but the culture linked to his forefathers is inferior to the culture</i><br>
<i> &gt; linked to *your* forefathers if you measure by things like</i><br>
<i> &gt; technological advancement, personal safety and possibilities for</i><br>
<i> &gt; growth (although *both* sets of cultures were and are highly</i><br>
<i> &gt; inadequate by transhuman standards).</i><br>
<p>
Interesting: here we have an individual ape presuming to pass<br>
judgement on the relative quality of vast collections of millions<br>
of apes lasting over centuries or millenia. I wonder how he manages<br>
such a feat? Of course, we each have to do the best we can in this<br>
department to make choices for our own self-education, but surely<br>
it's a mistake to think that such judgements are even remotely<br>
scientific.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; rationality).  Every person should only be accountable for eir</i><br>
<i> &gt; actions unless party in an "agreement" that states otherwise. Right?</i><br>
<p>
In general, yes. "Possession is nine-tenths of the law" is<br>
economically efficient, to be sure, but I'm not quite sure yet<br>
if economic efficiency means the same thing as justice. Perhaps<br>
our perceptions of instances of justice is just our cultural<br>
"first-take" on the spontaneous emergence of structures that<br>
promote economic efficiency, and that later we find out that<br>
what we had thought was justice was just the invisible hand at<br>
work, and that there is no justice. Perhaps you are right about<br>
this. I don't know.<br>
