	Paul Hughes...<br>
<i>	&gt; I had</i><br>
<i>	&gt; no idea how much value and *virtue* people on this list have</i><br>
put on<br>
<i>	&gt; *hard* work. </i><br>
<p>
	What is *hard* work?  Is the alternative *soft* work, *easy*<br>
work, or *no* work?<br>
<p>
<i>	&gt; I would have thought, being</i><br>
<i>	&gt; extropians you would have the wisdom to see the value and</i><br>
<i>	&gt; *limitations* of hard work have. </i><br>
<p>
	What *limitations*?  The time spent earning a living?<br>
<p>
<i>	&gt; I would much rather spend my time transforming my self,</i><br>
<i>	&gt; creating art and having fun. </i><br>
<p>
	I would also if someone else gave me housing, food, equipment,<br>
etc at my whim.  But then *THEY* would be doing that which I<br>
abhor...i.e.: not spending all their time transforming themselves,<br>
creating art, and having fun.<br>
<p>
<p>
	Then Mark Grant...<br>
<i>	&gt;&gt;Can you point out *one* great work of art that didn't require</i><br>
a great deal <br>
	of hard work? <br>
<p>
	Can he also point out how extropians would share their ideas<br>
without some poor *hard* working hateful non-extropian  running the<br>
list, news groups, and web sites, the machines they run on, the network<br>
they connect to, the power system that enables them, etc...<br>
<p>
	Not to mention the unmentionables *hard* at work publishing the<br>
Extropy periodical...<br>
<p>
	Ad infinitum...<br>
<p>
	*Hard* work has nothing to do being a 'wage slave'.  I have<br>
chosen a career  I enjoy.  I basically get paid for creating, playing,<br>
and exploring.  I am actually amused I get paid for it.  I even enjoyed<br>
the *hard* work I put into my education to obtain this.  I have as much<br>
sympathy for anyone who wastes their learning years NOT preparing for<br>
life as I do for someone who knowing builds their house on a flood plain<br>
and then cries 'UNFAIR!' when the waters wash it away.<br>
