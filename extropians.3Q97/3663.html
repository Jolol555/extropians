This is a public apology to Eliezer:<br>
<p>
Eliezer said: I'm sorry, Pearson.<br>
<p>
Me:  You shouldn't be sorry - your anger was heartfelt and <br>
understandable.  I'm am the one who is sorry.<br>
<p>
<p>
Eliezer siad: But please, PLEASE stop the *lighthearted* references to <br>
the Holocaust. I visited the Holocaust Museum less than a month ago and <br>
I can't take this. Your casual comparisions are a thousand times more <br>
obscene than any swear words that ever existed. <br>
<p>
I still can't write that or read it without tears coming to my eyes.<br>
<p>
Please stop the Holocaust references.  PLEASE.<br>
<p>
<p>
Me:  I very, VERY sorry Eleizer for what I have unintentional wrought <br>
here.  My heart goes out to you and I feel for you.  I assure you I was <br>
using the word 'nazi' in *whay I thought* was a sterile, objective <br>
manner.  As several have eloquenty pointed out I used it without forethought. <br>
 I have learned something here.  I ill not use it again except in the <br>
most objective of contexts.<br>
<p>
Very Warmly,<br>
<p>
Holly Pearson<br>
