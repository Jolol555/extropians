I have heard it, and there seems to be some neuropsychology to<br>
support it (but this is of course still speculative) :-)<br>
<p>
Seriously, I think both are parallel systems. Pain is quite well<br>
understood (OK, I'm lying - but it is much better understood than<br>
pleasure) and seems to involve a series of spinal regulatory systems<br>
(the pain gates of the zona gelatinosa) sending signals up to the<br>
periaqueductal gray matter (seems to control it), the activation<br>
systems of the brainstem (esp. the locus ceruleus) and the thalamus,<br>
where it sends both "sharp" signals to the sensory cortices ("WHERE<br>
is the pain?") and diffuse signals to all of the brain ("THERE IS<br>
PAIN!"). <br>
<p>
Pleasure seems to be based in the basal forebrain (the septal region,<br>
esp. nucleus accumbens), closely linked to the serotenergic systems,<br>
the limbic system, hypothalamus and the medial forebrain bundle. <br>
<p>
Note that pleasure seems to come from inside the brain, while pain<br>
seems to come from the outside. They are also independent, you can<br>
have great pleasure while having great pain. So my guess is that<br>
since pain is very activating, it might enhance the pleasure<br>
experience besides adding another "bouquet" to it; a wild speculation<br>
might be that it makes the usual almost epileptic limbic activity<br>
during intense pleasure even wilder.<br>
<p>
Who said neuroscience only had medical uses? I think it can be<br>
applied with some success in the bedroom... :-)<br>
