I would love some feedback--the following is being published in this<br>
months Evolutionary Theory. Sorry for cross-postings. <br>
<p>
[[The abstract or the entire paper?]]<br>

Thanks!<br>

                                Abstract<br>
<p>
Hyperthesis: a new classification for qualitative scientific concepts<br>
that are supported by overwhelming evidence <br>
<p>
<p>
        Scientific concepts are arranged within a flexible hierarchy <br>
and<br>
rigidly evaluated via the scientific method. The three main classes for<br>
scientific explanations are hypotheses, theories, and laws. Although <br>
all<br>
scientific concepts are accepted on a provisional basis, the theory of<br>
natural selection via differential reproduction is the highest regarded<br>
concept in the life sciences because so many lines of modern evidence<br>
support it. In fact, the revised, neodarwinian theory of natural<br>
selection provides the intellectual backdrop for current biological<br>
thought and research. <br>
<p>
[[[You might mention that subsets of the Modern Synthesis <br>
(neodarwinism)<br>
fuel or contribute to several rapidly growing hard engineering <br>
fields,e.g. <br>
evolveable hardware/software, memetics,distributed computation and <br>
networking.]]<br>
<p>
Unlike physics, scientific laws are rare in<br>
biology because the complexities of living systems are not easily<br>
reduced into simple rules or elegant formulas; therefore, qualitative<br>
concepts like natural selection will never be replaced by any general,<br>
mathematical Law of Evolution.<br>
<p>
[[Um, isn’t  *Evolutionary Therory* a journal with mathematical models <br>
of various life system processes? Perhaps a general model is not <br>
possible, <br>
but the restricted problems might deserve mention.]]<br>
<p>
 Unfortunately, the term "theory" in<br>
colloquial English also refers to an unproved idea that is likely wild<br>
speculation, false conjecture, or pure fantasy. As a result, many<br>
non-scientists, laypeople, and creationists misuse the word "theory" to<br>
suggest that natural selection and other valid concepts might be<br>
scientifically unsound. <br>
<p>
[[Just so. The Third International list “imaginative contemplation”<br>
and “belief” as first and second definitions of “theory”. Only in #3 <br>
and #4<br>
are scientific definitions aired, which incidentally take up 2/3 of the <br>
text<br>
and require much more dedication to fathom.<br>
Definition #5 is ...”something taken for granted esp. on trivial or <br>
inadequate grounds...”.]]<br>
<p>
Since the theory of natural selection is the<br>
keystone principle of biology, there should be no discrepancy between<br>
the general public and the scientific community on how important and<br>
useful the concept of natural selection actually is.<br>
<p>
[[This presumes a sanity and competency of the GP.]]<br>
<p>
Therefore, I<br>
propose the hyperthesis (Gr. hyper, above + tithenai, to put), a new<br>
classification for scientific concepts which would currently be ranked<br>
as well supported, qualitative theories. <br>
<p>
[[A fair enough neologism, but it may lack market appeal (cf memetic <br>
engineering).<br>
Do you have a list of snappier alternatives? <br>
