In message &lt;3.0.1.32.19970804184323.0085b5d0@pop.dial.pipex.com&gt;, Sarah<br>
Marr &lt;sarah.marr@dial.pipex.com&gt; writes<br>
<i>&gt;Has anybody read any well though out, cogently argued and evidentially</i><br>
<i>&gt;supported theories as to why technology, commerce, exploration, science,</i><br>
<i>&gt;etc. developed in the West (and East) whilst the African sub-continent</i><br>
<i>&gt;remained isolated and communites there relied on gatherer-hunter activities</i><br>
<i>&gt;and basic agriculture?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm sure I read somewhere that the Christian concept of God had a lot to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;with it, since it includes the concept of free agency of the individual: a</i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom for self-achievement which is itself a form of worship. But then,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Chinese invented gunpowder, etc. without Christianity. Equally, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;civilizations of the Roman and Greek empires were founded before Christianity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It strikes me that the rapid pace of Western development must have had a</i><br>
<i>&gt;certain spark, and that once it started it snowballed (from spark to</i><br>
<i>&gt;snowball, hmmm). So why didn't that spark occur in Africa, or amongst</i><br>
<i>&gt;tribes in Indonesia, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I want to try to get a grasp on this issue, because it seems so similar to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the one we face now, as Extropians. What is it that sparks us to desire</i><br>
<i>&gt;technological progression, whilst others are happy with the status quo, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;fearful of development?</i><br>

There is a huge body of literature in the field of the philosophy of<br>
history that deals with this, some of it from a broadly classical<br>
liberal orientation:<br>
<p>
* Firstly, there are racist explanations. I do not believe that these<br>
should be rejected apriori.  Amongst the many works one should consult<br>
are:<br>
<p>
John A. Baker, Race, Oxford University Press, 1974/Foundation for Human<br>
Understanding, Athens, Georgia, 1995<br>
<p>
J. Phillip Rushton, Race, Evolution and Behavior: A Life History<br>
Perspective, Transcation Books, New Brinswick, New Jersey, 1994<br>
<p>
Nathaniel Weyl, The Creative Elite in America, Public Affairs Press,<br>
Washington, DC, 1966<br>
&amp; Steffan T. Possony, The Geography of Intellect, Regnery, Chicago, 1963<br>
<p>
* There are environmental/geographic explanations.  Henry Thomas Buckle,<br>
a great classical liberal, in his famous work The History of<br>
Civilization in England (1857), Grant Richards, London, 1904/D.<br>
Appleton, New York, 1895, discusses both geographical determinants,<br>
economic determinants and the role of ideas.<br>
<p>
My hero the great liberal J. M. Robertson deals very well with Buckle in<br>
his Buckle and His Critics: A Study in Sociology, Swan Sonnenschein,<br>
London, 1895<br>
<p>
* Frederick J. Teggart, who was classical liberal in his orientation,<br>
and is now almost totally forgotten, offered a very interesting broad<br>
philosophical approach to human social evolution based on "external"<br>
stimulative forces. His major works The Processes of History, Yale<br>
University Press, 1910 and Theory of History, Yale University Press,<br>
1925 can be found in a one-volume reprint as Theory and Processes of<br>
History, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1978<br>
<p>
* There is a huge literature on the causes of capitalism and the causes<br>
of the "rise of the West". There are many conflicting views of the<br>
impact of Christianity in its various versions (eg the Weber-Protestant<br>
Ethic  thesis).  Many recent works, informed by a fairly positive view<br>
of the nature of free markets and of individual liberty, ascribe much<br>
influence to the "anarchic"/polycentric nature of European civilisation<br>
(ie a lack of a continent-wide monopoly state). See, for example:<br>
<p>
Douglas North &amp; Robert P. Thomas, The Rise of the Western World: A New<br>
Economic History, Cambridge University Press, 1973<br>
<p>
Mancur Olson, The Rise and Decline of Nations, Yale University Press,<br>
New Haven, Conn., 1982<br>
<p>
Gerard Radnitzky (1987), "A Economic Theory of the Rise of Civilization<br>
and Its Policy Implications", Ordo, Vol. 30, pp. 47-90<br>
<p>
John A. Hall, Powers and Liberties: An Account of the Causes and<br>
Consequences of the Rise of the West, Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1985<br>
<p>
E. L. Jones, The European Miracle: Environments, Economics and<br>
Geopolitics in the History of Europe and asia, Cambridge University<br>
Press, 1981/2nd edn, 1987<br>
<p>
Nathan Rosenberg &amp; L. E. Birdzell, How the West Grew Rich, Basic Books,<br>
New York/I. VB. Tauris, London, 1986 <br>
<p>
*An interesting discussion of the influence of different types of family<br>
structures, their differing "ethos" and apparent poltical consequences<br>
can be found in the works of the French anthropologist Emmanuel Todd:<br>
The Explanation of Ideology: Family Structures and Social Systems, Basil<br>
Blackwell, Oxford, 1985<br>
The Causes of Progress: Culture, Authority and Change, Basil Blackwell,<br>
Oxford, 1987 <br>
<p>
* A recent book addressing the whole question is Jared Diamond, Guns,<br>
Germs and Steel: The Types of Human Societies, Jonathan Cape, London,<br>
1997 (sorry, don't have the details of the US edn). William McNeil<br>
critically reviews it The New York Review of Books, 15 May 1997, and<br>
there is an exchange between them in the 26 June 1997 edn, pp. 69-70<br>
<p>
This is only a taster to some of the fascinating work that exists<br>
addressing the general topic.  My own view is that the ultimate answer<br>
will lay in a "multi-factorial" (ugh!) answer that integrates external/<br>
geographic/climactic/environmental factors, sheer historical contingency<br>
(ie luck and accident), psychological factors, the role of ideas, and<br>
the influence of differing political structures (ie how far they can<br>
cripple market forces or not).<br>
<p>
Yes, I am working on a long work on this subject - but don't ask me when<br>
I'll have it finished! <br>
