The theory is that blacks were placed at a substantial disadvantage<br>
by a couple of centuries of legal (i.e. government-sponsored)<br>
discrimination. Thus, we need to give blacks preferential treatment<br>
to compensate. Frankly, this has always seemed reasonable to me<br>
both in theory and in practice, but just as the earlier discrimination<br>
hurt most blacks and some whites, the current situation hurts some<br>
whites and some blacks, while helping some blacks. Since I'm a<br>
white upper-income male, I'm not usually directly affected, so the<br>
current situation, though clearly not perfect, is good enough that<br>
it's not high on my list of things to think about.<br>
<p>
I want to live in a world where each individual is evaluated and<br>
treated as an individual. I would like government policy to be<br>
directed toward that goal. I would like to see a gradual elimination<br>
of preferential treatment for blacks over a period of decades. I<br>
believe that this is exactly what we are seeing. I would also like<br>
to see us work our way out of some of the nasty effects of our<br>
current welfare system. We seem to be making progress with this, too.<br>
these subjects are correlated because, due to our history, many<br>
blacks are poor and became part of the welfare system. Note that<br>
many poor whites who are part of an equivalent but distinct<br>
welfare subculture. We cannot eliminate these subcultures overnight<br>
simply by waving our hands and trotting out our high-falutin'<br>
principles. Those are real black and white people.<br>
