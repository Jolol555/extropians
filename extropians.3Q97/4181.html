<p>
I don't think that the million-to-one estimate refers to a generic<br>
malfunction of the probe.  I think that it refers to the specific<br>
malfunction of a course error during a specific time window of the<br>
mission.  That estimate, for example, explicitly does *not*<br>
include launch failure, where re-entry friction does not represent<br>
a factor.<br>
<p>
A course error during that specific window-of-vulnerability would<br>
represent a malfunction, while only a very small set of possible<br>
course errors would result in a high-speed re-entry.  From space,<br>
the earth is a very small target.  The velocities involved exceed<br>
earth escape velocity, and so "decaying orbit" considerations<br>
don't enter into the calculations.<br>
<p>
I don't know the algorithm or the data used to calculate the<br>
million-to-one estimate.  The "roundness" of the number (a million<br>
and not 500,000 or 2 million) leads me to suspect that the<br>
algorithm involved inequalities, and represents a "not to exceed"<br>
value rather than an exact value.  When considered from the<br>
perspective of the entire mission profile, it sounds pessimistic,<br>
and not optimistic, to me.<br>
