Kauffman nets (randomly wired graphs) show a very interesting<br>
property: if the ratio of edges/nodes goes over the threshold<br>
of 0.5, most nodes crystallize into one giant, interconnected<br>
domain. A classical phase transition, obviously: gradual<br>
change, before, gradual change, after; a very rapid change,<br>
interim.<br>
<p>
This has some impacts onto the grassroot nets I've been<br>
proposing for years (seasoned denizens will probably remember.<br>
Several people came up with related schemes, it is probably a<br>
FAQ item somewhere). But let's describe the status quo first, to<br>
learn what exactly what, if anything, is amiss with the way we<br>
are accustomed to do things just now.<br>
<p>
Currently, there is a sharp boundary between the consumer and<br>
the provider. Single users have to pay the telcos for use of<br>
their comm lines, the providers for bandwidth and computational<br>
resource. In some, less advanced regions of the world, a telco<br>
monopoly still prevails. Behind it, hides the ISP semimonopoly,<br>
attempting to maximize profits by keeping newcomers out. It<br>
won't hold for long for sure, but damage's done, already.<br>
<p>
On the other side of the spectrum, bottom-up networking has<br>
begun. We have the CAN bus on the side of the microcomputer<br>
embeddeds, IBM's PAN via the "handshake" protocol, ethernet<br>
networking in the flat; between home PCs, IrDA (now extended to<br>
4 MBit/s) to talk to the portable, wireless modems, and the<br>
like. With the recent advent of cheap multiport cards, 10/100<br>
switches, GBit ethernet, and plastic fiber optics relatively<br>
impressive hardware will become available to the home user.<br>
<p>
In a very real sense, random interlinking has already begun. It<br>
is possibly only a question of time, before adjacent domains<br>
crosslink and coalesce, resulting in a larger nucleus. Its<br>
participants profit mutually, as a linkup has emergent<br>
properties (distributed storage, resource sharing, etc.) If we<br>
extrapolate this way into the future, we'll get a global<br>
grassroot net.<br>
<p>
A quick sketch, how this can be possibly accomplished.<br>
<p>
Birds of a feather flock together. This also applies to likewise<br>
minded individuals. In some regions the critical potential user<br>
density is already reached. A (possibly boosted) IrDA module, a<br>
pair of magnifying bathroom mirrors (to collimate the 30 deg<br>
beam), and a PPP infrared link across the street is in place.<br>
Links along the street may form a pretty good backbone, ranging<br>
for many 100 m even with primitive optics. There are few<br>
problems assotiated with a twisted pair network in the house<br>
(current loops), put galvanic potential-separating cheap optical<br>
fiber is around the corner. Using laser diodes and directed<br>
microwave links will be the next step.<br>
<p>
Many users object to let their machines run 24 h/day, also most<br>
OSses show too limited performance and availability (two<br>
free Unix users won't probably find any of this very demanding).<br>
A hardware solution is in order, which may well be based on a<br>
dedicated embedded solution, or on embedded PCs running Linux,<br>
or, possibly, (embedded) Java in the near future. A low-cost<br>
solution would use (optocoupled, or optical (IrDA)) RS232, a<br>
more expensive one, ethernet. The system must be performant<br>
enough to be able to handle several channels simultaneously (in<br>
some cases a simple crossbar may already suffice, in some<br>
interim storage and packet checking might be mandatory). The<br>
system must come in a rugged, atmosphere-proof case, large<br>
enough to contain a buffering battery (in case the system is<br>
powered by a solar cell, crucial for a standalone relais).<br>
The basic idea here is that users own the hardware, and do some<br>
very limited maintance.<br>
<p>
There are several things to tackle: nanocash packet accounting<br>
(to prevent network abuse), firewalling (agents should be able<br>
to live in the boxes, but not to enter your home machine &amp; to<br>
do some havoc there), and a geodetic routing design.<br>
<p>
The latter point is tough. Ubiquitous networking will need a<br>
very different routing scheme than current TCP/IP. Constraints<br>
like visibility demand such a scheme (tesselating space in<br>
addressable voxels, which can be occupied by a hardware box).<br>
The latter demands a huge address space. If you can imagine a<br>
mm^3 voxel sphere ranging to beyond GEO, you might notice that<br>
IPng has got a problem (the raw address space would suffice).<br>
In the routing scheme there should be no difference between<br>
routing and switching. Boxes, knowing their spatial address<br>
(from GPS, and/ultrasonic, or vis LPS), can select the nearest<br>
one. The benefits are twofold: you can't fake your address,<br>
since your neighbouring boxes would notice the tampering, and<br>
won't route your packet. Additionally, this gives a great means<br>
for automated traffic routing, whether for humans, or agents.<br>
(Remember a recent aerobot thread).<br>
<p>
This could go on for hours, I obviously have to truncate. Such a<br>
routing scheme appears devisable, using orthogonized hypercubes:<br>
hypergrids, or, lattices. Their capability to handle wraparound<br>
at address space boundaries fits nicely with curved spheres,<br>
both of surface, and orbital configurations. With some effort, a<br>
fuzzy routing scheme probably could be devised, which derives<br>
fuzzy addresses from wiring constraints.<br>
<p>
Comments?<br>
<p>
ciao,<br>
'gene<br>
<p>
P.S. I've got a related problem: I'd like to wire up with<br>
friends of mine living in the vicinity to share an ISP backlink<br>
to be able to use cable modems, which are unidirectional (all<br>
thanks to my favourite monopoly (Telekomiker)).<br>
<p>
P.P.S Just hooked up a tiny PC keyboard to my Newt130. The Newt<br>
(especially the Newt2000) is imo a pretty interesting minimal<br>
wearable platform, since both offering computational oomph (the<br>
NTK, a sofware developer set is available for free for download,<br>
and comes bundled with many Newton developer books, it allows<br>
the use of NewtonScript, reminiscent of Java, and native code<br>
as well), and is not too demanding in terms of power burned).<br>
Of course the peculiar demands of a wearable (which are weird,<br>
and many) demand a hackbox. <br>
