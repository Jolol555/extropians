There's satire, and there's dumb satire.  I haven' read RAW myself, so<br>
I'm not expressing an opinion on him.  But...<br>

...this is not a recommendation.  It's funny how pseudo-quantum newagers<br>
who decry the close-mindedness of "The Establishment" (not necessarily<br>
including RAW this bunch of newage) overlook the fact that the<br>
Establishment accepted quantum mechanics in the first place.  Einstein<br>
didn't, but he's notable for being an exception.  And of course the<br>
Establishment had accepted _his_ crazy ideas about relativity a few<br>
years before -- I mean, throwing out absolute space and time ain't<br>
trivial, folks.<br>
<p>
} establishment uses the Infallible Method: They only believe that which<br>

} their reason only that which they are willing to believe.   <br>
 <br>
And then there's continental drift.  A crazy idea Wegener came up with<br>
which no one listened to because they couldn't think of a mechanism.<br>
Also, apparently, because the evidence wasn't strong enough, because<br>
around 1968 oceanic floor magnetic studies came in which in a few years<br>
convinced many if not most geologists.  Know what?  They still didn't<br>
have a mechanism (got one a few years later, but not straight off) for<br>
how these continents were plowing through rock, but they couldn't ignore<br>
the data.<br>
<p>
If there were anyone who stepped forward and could read random numbers<br>
out of James Randi's mind, I'm sure CSICOP would disband.<br>
<p>
The point?  "RAW argues that... " is crap.  I'm sure sometimes a good<br>
idea has been hindered because someone influential had blinders against<br>
it.  But the history of the "Establishment" can also be told as a<br>
sequence of running off in very strange directions.  Saying scientists<br>
are too hidebound to do so isn't satire, it's wrong.  Unless you've<br>
utterly failed to do him justice.<br>
