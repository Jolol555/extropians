<p>
And which (AFAIK) was never mentioned until the 1980 book (Berlitz?),<br>
*thirty-three years* after the supposed crash, and even then there were<br>
no first-hand accounts. Yet from the number of supposed 'witnesses' crawling <br>
out of the woodwork most of the population of New Mexico seems to have seen <br>
the crash site, shaken hands with the aliens, bought the T-shirt and taken <br>
souvenirs which miraculously disappeared later on. How come not one of these <br>
people spoke about it to a UFO investigator for over thirty-three years? <br>
<p>
And if it really happened and the USAF managed to cover it up for<br>
thirty-three years, how come they came up with such a supposedly lame<br>
cover story? Why would a super-powerful Air Force which could keep an<br>
alien saucer crash secret for a third of a century suddenly turn around<br>
and say that their communication records were destroyed, rather than<br>
creating a bulletproof cover story from scratch? Would that have convinced<br>
any of the saucer-freaks anyway? (note that it's not just the "Roswell<br>
incident" records which are missing, it's most of the records from March<br>
1945 to December 1949 and this was apparently common practice at the time; <br>
how long do you expect the Air Force to keep records about crashed <br>
balloons?). <br>
<p>
Note also that Marcel, one of the primary 'witnesses for the prosecution'<br>
was reported in the 1980 book as stating that the photographs showing him<br>
with the debris did in fact show the materials he found at the ranch;<br>
debris which appears to be a 1940s-era radar reflector as used on the<br>
Mogul balloons. So it would seem that either he found a radar reflector or<br>
his testimony is suspect; either way the Roswell myth starts to fall apart<br>
merely on that count. <br>
<p>
The evidence from the time supports the balloon theory. Everything else is<br>
merely hearsay more than a third of a century after the fact. There is<br>
*not one piece* of physical evidence for the crash theory, otherwise the<br>
vast majority of us would be convinced. <br>

P.S. Odd, isn't it, that there are so many Roswell believers on a list <br>
which rails against Velikovsky for lack of evidence?<br>
