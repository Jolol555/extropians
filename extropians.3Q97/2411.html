I'll just give you the left-wing, Dutch pinko view on this stuff and if you<br>
want to flame me to crisp ... that is your right as a free entity.<br>
Maybe it would be worthwhile to try to break the armrace between a number<br>
of citizens and American law-enforcement agencies.<br>
If everybody can (and does) own guns, policing becomes dangerous as hell,<br>
cops want bigger guns and more of them, and they will use them more often.<br>
In Holland NOBODY get's to own a gun unless there are special circumstances.<br>
our murder-rate is about 15 (fifteen!!) times as low as the US (per capita).<br>
Now, there could also be other reasons for this but IM(very)HO the private<br>
ownership of (hundreds?)of millions of handguns, shotguns and such has<br>
something to do with it. I onze read somewhere that between 1965 and 1975<br>
more than 500.000 US citizens where shot in the US (10 for every American<br>
killed in 'nam).<br>
For their sake, please consider a society without (to much) guns and a<br>
governement that you at least trust a little bit.<br>
Seems to work out more or less here ...<br>
<p>
If the US governement is as F*%$#-up as you seem to believe (I woulnd't<br>
know, being on this side of the atlantic), why not get a new one? Last time<br>
I heard the US was a democracy.<br>
<p>
Mick, in spite of the fact that I don't always agree with you, I find you<br>
down-to-earth remarks very refreshing (and fun!).<br>
