I wonder, what exactly is extropian?  And to be extropian, do you have to<br>
know what an extropian is or does, or do you just have to want to increase<br>
your personal extropy?  And if that is so, then surely everyone is extropian,<br>
someone with a defeatist attitude has just built that attitude on top of a<br>
nice clean extropian foundation.  After all, if we didn't want to improve<br>
ourselves we'd all be primates.<br>
