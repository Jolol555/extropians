Hello Extropian Lunatics (and I mean this in the *best* possible use of the<br>
word:))<br>
<p>
Does anyone know how to contact Arthur C. Clark?  He is still my favorite<br>
Sci-Fi Author, and I would like to let him know about the ALCOR cryonics<br>
option.   If there is any chance of saving this forward thinking brain we<br>
should do so, IMO.<br>
<p>
We have already lost Sagan, Feynman, and Asimov to entropy and heat death.<br>
 These promulgators of extropian and scientific memes should have been<br>
preserved for possible reanimation, dammit!  <br>
<p>
Especially Sagan...what a wonderful mind...I am in awe of his intellect and<br>
ability to express and popularize science and scientific thinking every time<br>
I read another of his books.  <br>
<p>
And what of Gene Roddenberry, Father of Star Trek?  I saw him in person at<br>
Ball State U. in IN about a zillion years ago.  While S T may be bogus as<br>
"Hard" Sci Fi, the Humanist and Secular  future Roddenberry envisioned was<br>
way ahead of his time.  And his brain is toast!  <br>
<p>
Does this tick anyone else off?  The leading skeptics, agnostics, forward<br>
thinking minds of our age have not chosen the possibility of cryonic<br>
suspension.  <br>
<p>
SO,  HERE IS MY CAMPAIGN.... LET'S FREEZE CLARK!  <br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
Rudi Hoffman<br>
