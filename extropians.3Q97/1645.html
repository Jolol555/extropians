About Ms. Hagbard's: <br>
 <br>
For me, in personal, are not just the ideas "per se" on the list,  <br>
that principally improve myself. See what I mean: The ideas here <br>
exposed and developped are a consequence of  the very good and  <br>
developped intelectual "cyber" companies to talk the list<br>
provides... individually and in group. (It functions like a <br>
ressonator or a chain-reaction knowledge chamber...) and the list <br>
definition topics are in  very good agreement with this... <br>
<p>
(I have already entered in a disc. list - which I will not mention <br>
the name... - which was intended to be of philosophy but was  <br>
full of religious and believers, some of them with not even <br>
philosophical (and questionable) minds... Imagine now an atheist and <br>
objective scientist (and masterate level teacher, so with no fear to <br>
talk about certain subjects...hehehe) in the discussions: I felt <br>
myself the own Hell's King ... hehehe... but very stressant...Know <br>
you (if already don't..) that, worse than Hell of Ignorance is that <br>
of those who "do not want to know...") <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I've been self-reflecting a lot lately (summer job lifeguarding -- lotsa</i><br>
<i>&gt; time to think) and I have a "simple" question for all extropians:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What changes in your personal lifestyle have you taken to increase the</i><br>
<i>&gt; amount of extropy therein (changes = mental, physical, social, etc.)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or if not changes, per se, what have you always been doing to effect the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same end?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm most interested in ideas and insight into self-improvement from list</i><br>
<i>&gt; members' personal experiences.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thanks,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hagbard</i><br>
