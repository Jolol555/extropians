: [...]  I firmly believe that government does a lot of good<br>
<p>
(we're still waiting for a specific example)<br>
<p>
: and is quite capable of doing a lot more good than it does. It would<br>
: certainly work a lot better if we would all put our egos in our back<br>
: pockets and let those of us who have spent a lifetime studying and working<br>
: at our chosen careers in professional government service trying to do our<br>
: jobs despite the continuous interference of well meaning dilettants and a<br>
: herd of politically and ideologically fixated ignoramusus who know little<br>
: or nothing about governmental operations except how to gum up the works<br>
: with unnecessary regulations and other bothersome clap-trap.<br>
<p>
The private sector does a lot of good - some say literally all the good<br>
in the world.  It could do a lot more good if it weren't hobbled at<br>
every turn by the (let's charitably assume) well-meaning interference<br>
of the professional busybodies who claim to know our jobs (and our needs)<br>
better than we do, though they never in their lives have to face a paying<br>
customer who can say no.<br>
<p>
The people who criticize government are not "interfering", we're the<br>
boss - or so we were taught in public school.  We're not "dilettanti",<br>
we're the ones whose livelihoods keep being whittled away by professionals<br>
like you (more deserving of the title "dilettanti", because you'll never<br>
feel the effects of your interference).  We're the ones who pay for your<br>
COLA and your pension (before we're allowed to try to provide for<br>
ourselves).  We're the ones whose presumed consent gives the whole<br>
house of cards its legitimacy - or so we were taught in public school.<br>
We're the "ignoramus" who get blamed for voting, by an exquisite chain<br>
of indirection, for the policies you enact.<br>
<p>
: For those of you who have wonderful theories on how to improve government<br>
: let us see how they can be implimented for the broad common good. ...<br>

Perhaps you haven't heard that there used to be a country called<br>
the United States of America, whose Constitution contained a clause<br>
limiting its powers to a short list explicitly delegated to it.<br>
It's said to have worked pretty well overall, so well that it<br>
attracted millions of immigrants from countries whose governments<br>
took a more active interest in all those things you say a government<br>
should.<br>
<p>
Or at least that's what I was told in public school.<br>
No doubt you have more advanced information.<br>

A government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough<br>
to take everything you have.  -- Barry Goldwater<br>
<p>
A government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the<br>
support of Paul. -- George Bernard Shaw<br>
<p>
A legal order that is subject to the influence of public opinion, and<br>
that evolves according to the application of the liberal principles of<br>
openness to human interaction, can be said to be democratic, no matter<br>
what its form of government.  Democracy should not privilege what<br>
people *say* they want in the very imperfect mode of communication we<br>
call voting, over what they indicate they want in other ways, by their<br>
actions and their other communicative efforts. It should not privilege<br>
explicit, conscious action by a single institution that is supposed to<br>
`speak for' the public, over the tacit, distributed wisdom that is<br>
embedded in our evolved legal rules.  -- Don Lavoie 1992<br>
<p>
A politician normally prospers under democracy in proportion ... as he<br>
excels in the invention of imaginary perils and imaginary defenses<br>
against them.  ---H L Mencken 1918<br>
<p>
A world which is perfectly safe for the stupidest imaginable wanker is<br>
a damned annoying place in which to live for anyone else.  -- Douglas<br>
G. Henke &lt;henke@netcom.com&gt; in alt.peeves<br>
<p>
After every revolution there is an interregnum, in which communities<br>
run themselves and all is well, and then the new regime comes in and<br>
screws things up.  ---Desmond Hawkins in _Blue Mars_ (Kim Stanley<br>
Robinson 1995)<br>
<p>
Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution<br>
will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious<br>
interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes<br>
which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence<br>
of the offices they hold under the State establishments . . . .  --<br>
Publius : Federalist 01<br>
<p>
An expert is someone who articulates the needs of those in power.  --<br>
Henry Kissinger<br>
<p>
Anarchy is bad *because* somebody might die or get hurt. But statism is<br>
good *even though* many, many people die and get hurt.  ---Ken Hooper<br>
&lt;khooper@wsp1.wspice.com&gt;<br>
<p>
As a rule, if you want people to love you, you shouldn't lie to them,<br>
steal their property, corrupt their children, and drive their<br>
businesses into the ground.  ---Lew Rockwell: "Love the Strangler?",<br>
RRR 95/7<br>
<p>
But extremism is such FUN!  -- Lizard<br>
<p>
Capitalism undoubtedly has certain boils and blotches upon it, but has<br>
it as many as government? Has it as many as marriage? Has it as many as<br>
religion? I doubt it. It is the only basic institution of modern man<br>
that shows any genuine health and vigor .... the only serious criticism<br>
of capitalism comes from ladies and gentlemen who are palpably somewhat<br>
balmy.  The trouble with all of them is that they are constructive<br>
critics: not content to tear down, they try to build up. It is a fatal<br>
error ...  ---H L Mencken<br>
<p>
Common sense is the most evenly distributed quantity in the world.<br>
Everyone thinks he has enough.  ---Ren Descartes 1637<br>
<p>
Disobedience, in the eyes of anyone who has read history, is man's<br>
original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been<br>
made, through disobedience and through rebellion.  ---Oscar Wilde<br>
<p>
Everything government touches turns to crap.  ---Ringo Starr<br>
<p>
Experience without theory teaches nothing.  In fact, experience can not<br>
even be recorded unless there is some theory, however crude, that leads<br>
to an hypothesis and a system by which to catalog observations.<br>
Sometimes only a hunch, right or wrong, is sufficient theory to lead to<br>
useful observation.  -- Clarence Irving Lewis &amp; W. Edwards Deming<br>
<p>
Extreme law is often extreme injustice.  ---Terence, _Heauton<br>
Timoroumenos_<br>
<p>
Fear is the foundation of most governments.  ---John Adams<br>
<p>
For every complex problem, there is a solution that is simple, neat,<br>
and wrong.  ---H. L. Mencken<br>
<p>
For the sake of the achievement of a specific political goal, it is<br>
possible to sacrifice half mankind.  ---Mao Tse-Tung, November 1957<br>
<p>
Freedom means respecting the views of those who may disagree with the<br>
views of their government.  ---Hillary Rodham Clinton addressing the<br>
U.N.'s Women's Conference in Beijing, 5 Sept 1995.<br>
<p>
Freedom of the human personality cannot be given by society, and by its<br>
source and nature it cannot depend upon society -- it belongs to man<br>
himself, as a spiritual being.  And society, unless it makes<br>
totalitarian claims, can on recognize this freedom.  This basic truth<br>
about freedom was reflected in the doctrines of natural law, of the<br>
rights of man, independent of the state, of freedom, not only as<br>
freedom within society, but freedom from society with its limitless<br>
claims on man.  ---Nicholas Berdyaev<br>
<p>
Further, when those of a libertarian bent set out to make socialism<br>
work better, whether by managing the activity or by their endorsement<br>
of legislation which would modify the socialistic details, they tacitly<br>
approve the socialistic premise and thereby abandon their own case for<br>
the free market.  They forswear all fundamental argument against the<br>
socialistic premise because by their actions they acknowledge that it<br>
could be improved were they themselves framing or administering it.<br>
"Socialism, were I its manager, wouldn't be so bad."  That, I submit,<br>
is an emanation from the mind of a know-it-all, in words loud and clear<br>
. . . .<br>
The student of liberty, if he is not to get off the track, must hope<br>
and work for the restoration of the free market and a government<br>
restored to its principled role of keeping the peace.  Then let him<br>
peacefully keep in character by leaving socialistic activities to those<br>
who aren't yet aware of how little they know. Left to their own<br>
resources, the bungling of their schemes may become apparent even to<br>
themselves and, most certainly to libertarians who have not fallen into<br>
this trap.  Why should libertarians absolve the socialists by becoming<br>
a party to their unworkable measures?  ---Leonard Read, The Free Market<br>
and Its Enemy, 1965 [pp 43-44]<br>
<p>
Give me a fruitful error any time, full of seeds, bursting with its own<br>
corrections.  You can keep your sterile truth for yourself.<br>
---Vilfredo Pareto<br>
<p>
God grant me the company of those who seek the truth, and God deliver<br>
me from those who have found it.  -- Isaac Newton<br>
<p>
Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption of<br>
authority.  It is hardly too strong to say that the Constitution was<br>
made to guard the people against the dangers of good intentions.  There<br>
are men in all ages who mean to govern well, but they mean to govern.<br>
They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be masters. -- Daniel<br>
Webster<br>
<p>
Government is a broker in pillage, and every election is a sort of<br>
advance auction of the sale of stolen goods. -- H.L. Mencken<br>
<p>
Government is not reason; it is not eloquence; IT IS FORCE.  Like FIRE,<br>
it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.  -- George Washington<br>
<p>
Government is the agent of those who are too refined to do their own<br>
mugging.  ---Joseph Sobran<br>
<p>
Government officials frequently view the taxpayer as a kind of<br>
productive herd to be milked and controlled just as the ancient<br>
slave-master presumed to control the person of his slave.  -- LeFevre,<br>
Robert<br>
<p>
Half the people in America work for a living; the other half vote for<br>
it. ---William E. Simon<br>
<p>
He alone is great and happy who requires neither to command nor to obey<br>
in order to secure his being of some importance in the world.  ---J.W.<br>
Von Goethe (1749-1832)<br>
<p>
He that would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy<br>
from oppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a<br>
precedent that will reach to himself.  -- Thomas Paine<br>
<p>
He who does not bellow the truth when he knows the truth makes himself<br>
the accomplice of liars and forgers.  ---Charles Peguy<br>
<p>
He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my<br>
contempt.  He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him<br>
the spinal cord would fully suffice.  ---Albert Einstein<br>
<p>
I am interested in politics so that one day I will not have to be<br>
interested in politics.  ---Ayn Rand<br>
<p>
I am of the opinion that anyone in politics can rise very quickly to<br>
the top if they are not weighed down by talent or integrity . . .  -- R<br>
Chetwynd-Hayes<br>
<p>
If government is legitimate, why does it need guns?  Mathematicians<br>
don't need guns. We think *they're* legitimate. Physicists don't need<br>
guns. Biologists don't need guns. Musicians don't need guns. Tool and<br>
die makers don't need guns. Copy editors don't need guns.  ---Ken<br>
Hooper &lt;khooper@wsp1.wspice.com&gt;<br>
<p>
I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who endowed us with<br>
sense, reason, and intellect had intended for us to forgo their use.<br>
---Galileo<br>
<p>
I don't practice what I preach, because I'm not the kind of person I'm<br>
preaching to.  -- J R "Bob" Dobbs<br>
<p>
I have little interest in streamlining government or in making it more<br>
efficient, for I mean to reduce its size.  I do not undertake to<br>
promote welfare, for I propose to extend freedom. My aim is not to pass<br>
laws, but to repeal them.  It is not to inaugurate new programs, but to<br>
cancel old ones that do violence to the Constitution, or that have<br>
failed in their purpose, or that impose on the people an unwarranted<br>
financial burden.  I will not attempt to discover whether legislation<br>
is `needed' before I have first determined whether it is<br>
constitutionally permissible.  And if I should later be attacked for<br>
neglecting my constituents' `interests,' I shall reply that I was<br>
informed their main interest is liberty and that in that cause I am<br>
doing the very best that I can.  -- Barry Goldwater : 1960<br>
<p>
I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any<br>
party of men whatever, in religion, in philosophy, in politics or in<br>
anything else, where I was capable of thinking for myself. Such an<br>
addiction is the last degradation of a free and moral agent. If I could<br>
not go to Heaven but with a party, I would not go there at all.<br>
---Thomas Jefferson<br>
<p>
I sit on a man's back, choking him and making him carry me and yet<br>
assure others that I am sorry for him and wish to ease his lot by all<br>
possible means--except by getting off his back.  ---Leo Tolstoy<br>
<p>
I want no heaven for which I must give my reason; No happiness in<br>
exchange for my liberty; and no immortality that demands the surrender<br>
of my individuality.  ---Ingersoll<br>
<p>
I will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice.  On this<br>
subject I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation.<br>
No!  No!  Tell a man whose house is on fire to give a moderate alarm;<br>
tell him to moderately rescue his wife from the hands of the ravisher;<br>
tell the mother to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into<br>
which it has fallen; but urge me not to use moderation.  ---William<br>
Lloyd Garrison: The Liberator, 1831<br>
<p>
I would rather live in a society which treated children as adults than<br>
one which treated adults as children.  ---Lizard<br>
<p>
If all else fails, immortality can always be assured by spectacular<br>
error.  -- John Kenneth Galbraith<br>
<p>
If Big Brother comes to America, he will not be a fearsome, foreboding<br>
figure with a heart-chilling, omnipresent glare as in _1984_.  He will<br>
come with a smile on his face, a quip on his lips, a wave to the crowd,<br>
and a press that (a) dutifully reports the suppressive measures he is<br>
taking to save the nation from internal chaos and foreign threat; and<br>
(b) gingerly questions whether he will be able to succeed.  ---Michael<br>
Parenti, _Inventing_Reality_ (1986)<br>
<p>
If by `anarchy' you mean chaos and disorder, that's the exact opposite<br>
of what I want.  I'm for self-government, which means people  governing<br>
their own lives and not trying to govern yours, and  everyone taking<br>
more responsibility for themselves.  It's been shown time and time<br>
again that that's the way to have the maximum of harmony and abundance<br>
in society.  Actually, it is those who call for more political<br>
government - with all its violence and coercion - who are leading us in<br>
the direction of chaos and disorder.  -- Steve Smith<br>
<p>
If everything had gone as planned, everything would have been perfect.<br>

Texas<br>
<p>
If I am to study Russian Roulette, let me start with blanks. -- Hara Ra<br>
<p>
If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the<br>
conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my life as from<br>
that dry and parching wind of the African deserts called the simoom,<br>
which fills the mouth and nose and ears and eyes with dust till you are<br>
suffocated, for fear I should get some his good done to me, some of its<br>
virus mingled with my blood.  ---Henry Thoreau "Walden" Chapter 1<br>
<p>
If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as<br>
a nail.  -- Abraham Maslow<br>
<p>
If we look at the black record of mass murder, exploitation, and<br>
tyranny levied on society by governments over the ages, we need not be<br>
loath to abandon the Leviathan State and . . . try freedom.  -- Murray<br>
Rothbard, _For a New Liberty_<br>
<p>
If we were directed from Washington when to sow and when to reap, we<br>
should soon want bread.  -- Thomas Jefferson<br>
<p>
If, from the more wretched parts of the Old World, we look at those<br>
which are in an advanced stage in improvement, we still find the greedy<br>
hand of government thrusting itself into every corner &amp; crevice of<br>
industry &amp; grasping the spoil of the multitude.  Invention is<br>
continually exercised to furnish new pretenses for revenue &amp; taxation.<br>
It watches prosperity as its prey &amp; permits none to escape without<br>
tribute.  -- Thomas Paine : 1792 February<br>
<p>
In any free society, the conflict between social conformity and<br>
individual liberty is permanent, unresolvable, and necessary.<br>
---Kathleen Norris<br>
<p>
In politics, the middle way is none at all.  ---John Adams<br>
<p>
It has been experimentally proved, that if a plot of ground be sown<br>
with one species of grass, and a similar plot be sown with several<br>
distinct genera of grasses, a greater number of plants and a greater<br>
weight of dry herbage can be raised in the latter than in the former<br>
case.  The same has been found to hold good when one variety and<br>
several mixed varieties of wheat have been grown on equal spaces of<br>
ground.  ---Charles Darwin: The Origin of Species, chapter IV<br>
<p>
It is bad to be oppressed by a minority, but it is worse to be<br>
oppressed by a majority.  For there is a reserve of latent power in the<br>
masses which, if it is called into play, the minority can seldom<br>
resist.  But from the absolute will of an entire people there is no<br>
appeal, no redemption, no refuge . . . -- Lord Acton<br>
<p>
It is error alone that needs government support, truth can stand by<br>
itself.  ---Thomas Jefferson, "Notes on Virginia" 1785<br>
<p>
It stands to reason that where there's sacrifice, there's someone<br>
collecting sacrificial offerings. Where there is service, there is<br>
someone being served. The man who speaks to you of sacrifice speaks of<br>
slaves and masters. And intends to be master.  ---Ayn Rand<br>
<p>
It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men<br>
of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be<br>
read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be<br>
repealed or revised before they are promulged, or undergo such<br>
incessant changes that no man who knows what the law is to-day can<br>
guess what it will be tomorrow.  Law is defined to be a rule of action;<br>
but how can that be a rule, which is little known and less fixed?<br>
---James Madison, Federalist #62 (27-Feb-1788)<br>
<p>
Laws do not persuade just because they threaten.  ---Seneca: Epistulae<br>
morales ad Lucilum<br>
<p>
Let your voice be heard, whether or not it is to the taste of every<br>
jack-in-office who may be obstructing the traffic. By all means, render<br>
unto Caesar that which is Caesar's-- but this does not necessarily<br>

Liberty means responsibility; that is why most men dread it.  ---George<br>

Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they<br>

No man's life, liberty, or property is safe while the legislature is in<br>
session.  -- Judge Gideon J. Tucker: 1866<br>

Nothing is more dangerous than an idea, when you only have one idea.<br>
---Emile-Auguste Chartier<br>
<p>
Nothing so needs reforming as other people's habits.  -- Mark Twain<br>
<p>
Of all tyrannies a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be<br>
the most oppressive.  It may be better to live under robber barons than<br>
under omnipotent moral busybodies.  The robber baron's cruelty may<br>
sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those<br>
who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do<br>
so with the approval of their own conscience. . . . To be `cured'<br>
against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as<br>
disease is to be put on a level with those who have not yet reached the<br>
age of reason . . . You start being `kind' to people before you have<br>
considered their rights, and then force upon them supposed kindnesses<br>
which they in fact had a right to refuse, and finally kindnesses which<br>
no one but you will recognize as kindnesses and which the recipient<br>
will feel as abominable cruelties.  ---C S Lewis (1898-1963)<br>
<p>
Of course they beat up people.  The whole point of government is that<br>
it does things that you're not allowed to do, like beat people, kill<br>
people, steal their property, kidnap and imprison them, etc.  If they<br>
couldn't do things you couldn't do, why would you need them?  ---Phil<br>
Ngai<br>
<p>
Omnipotent psychotic businessmen are the downfall of every Libertarian<br>
scheme, as well as every other scheme.  Real psychotics are poor and<br>
therefore not omnipotent.  Scenarios with omnipotent psychotic<br>

politicians and their bureaucratic appointees are much like bomber<br>
crews:  They wreak much havoc, but seldom experience first hand the<br>

Remember that a government big enough to give you everything you want<br>
is also big enough to take away everything you have.  -- Col. Davy<br>
Crockett<br>
<p>
See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and gives<br>
it to other persons to whom it does not belong.  See if the law<br>
benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the<br>
citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime.  -- Frederic<br>
Bastiat<br>
<p>
See, when the GOVERNMENT spends money, it creates jobs; whereas when<br>
the money is left in the hands of TAXPAYERS, God only knows what they<br>
do with it.  Bake it into pies, probably.  Anything to avoid creating<br>
jobs.  ---Dave Barry<br>
<p>
Seek simplicity, and distrust it.  -- Alfred North Whitehead<br>
<p>
Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live; it is asking others to<br>

<p>
Sharing is to taxation as sex is to rape.  -- Jan Wasilewski<br>
<p>
Social justice should not contradict individual justice, either in<br>
theory or in practice .... It's pretty callous to forcibly deprive me<br>
of the fruit of my labour for the benefit of some other individual who<br>
didn't sweat my sweat.  I don't consider that social justice.  --<br>
Walter Williams: 1982<br>

Socialism will never succeed: it takes up too many evenings.  ---Oscar<br>

Some of the worst tyrannies of our day are pledged to the service of<br>

Some writers have so confounded society with government, as to leave<br>
little or no distinction between them; whereas they are not only<br>
different, but have different origins . . .Society is in every state a<br>
blessing, but Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary<br>
evil; in its worst state, an intolerable one.  ---Thomas Paine: Common<br>
Sense (1776)<br>
<p>
Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of<br>

have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?  Let history<br>
