<i>&gt;        Likewise.  I figure that since a goodly portion (if not most) of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the attendees will be staying at The Doubletree on Friday evening, it might</i><br>
<i>&gt;be nice to congregate somewhere and meet during the day (as in for lunch,</i><br>
<i>&gt;dinner etc.).  Undoubtedly most of us are bound to bump into and "meet"</i><br>
<i>&gt;each other at the hotel, but if anyone knows of any good places to gather</i><br>
<i>&gt;during the day in the vicinity, that would be nice also.</i><br>
<p>
In the evening, if you can get in, a nice, decadent place to eat is Menara,<br>
at First and Gish.  You sit on a cushion on the floor, eat yummy foods<br>
(they have a limited menu, but it does have a vegetarian option) with your<br>
hands, which are washed by pouring lemon-scented water (yes, real lemons)<br>
over them, and watch the belly dancer (quite good -- they used to have both<br>
genders on weekend nights, but I'm not sure if they do any more).<br>
<p>
If you go, plan to be there from about 7:30 or 8 to 9:30 or 10, and bring<br>
some singles to put in the belly-dancer's outfit.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Kennita<br>
