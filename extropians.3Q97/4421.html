I'm not terribly surprised.  There's an alt.books.iain-banks which is<br>
about as noisy as alt.extropians; this list may explain why.  But<br>
there's been activity occasionally, and I was underwhelmed by, say, the<br>
basic economic knowledge of the participants, or at least the louder<br>
ones.  On the other hand, if they're actually statist, that's kind of<br>
sad, considering that Banks, or at least the Culture, is rather<br>
anarchist.  Anarchist without a specified economy, yes, but anarchist.<br>
<p>
Well, anarchy of socialisms.  Banks feels that governing a collection of<br>
mostly self-sufficient spaceships and mobile habitats is pretty<br>
difficult, if not impossible.  We'd agree, but Banks also feels that the<br>
closeness and smallness of a ship or habitat would require a _sort of_<br>
socialism within the ship.  (Trick question: in an anarcho-capitalist<br>
O'Neill cylinder, how do you decide where the can goes?)  But that's<br>
what the Culture evolved from (all detailed in "A Few Notes on the<br>
Culture"): a bunch of ships and habitats running away from the<br>
nation-states on their home planets.  <br>
<p>
} Culture' is an amazing vision of the future.  Does anybody think that <br>
} 'The Culture' and extropiansm are compatible or incompatible, and why?<br>
 <br>
Obviously I think the Culture is extropian... more or less.  It depends<br>
on what you think of, though.  Dynamically optimistic?  Yep.  Boundless<br>
expansion?  Sort of; they do think it's gauche to terraform or break up<br>
planets.  Intelligent technology?  Gods, yes.  Self-transformation? Ok.<br>
Spontaneous Order/Self-ownership... pretty much, but the Culture doesn't<br>
have property.  How does that work?  I don't know.<br>
<p>
It'd be hard to have a productive argument without specifying various<br>
details, however.  As they aren't specified in the books, they'd have to<br>
be assumed explicitly at the begining of an argument.  Otherwise you'd<br>
be throwing, say, European left-anarchist values at American<br>
right-anarchist values, and making a mess.<br>
<p>
The Culture books are not hard SF, and don't try to be.  Weak economics;<br>
FTL (2 or 3 kinde); lots of humanoid races (which Banks acknowledges as<br>
odd, at least.)  However, I find that unlike Brin's Uplift Universe the<br>
whole thing is scalable into plausible imaginings: a bunch of ships and<br>
habitats careening around the solar system, with friendly AI, lots of<br>
automation, lots of power from solar panels, and a flattish generous <br>
distribution of wealth among the humans.<br>
<p>
} Then and only then will the 'Culture' become attainable - not through <br>

} its members.<br>
 <br>
See my second paragraph.<br>
