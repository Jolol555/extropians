<p>
The thought is that both groups migrated from a common origin in Central<br>
Asia, which seems to generate invading cultures, (Athabascans, Aryans, Turks,<br>
others of varying success).  The Athabascans were unusual in that they were<br>
able to get to North America as well.  It's thought that there was cultural<br>
diffusion along the way - but the remains have been exterminated by susequent<br>
invasions along more-or-less the same routes.<br>
<p>
The Iceland route requires serious deep sea vessels, which (probably) weren't<br>
available.  Also, the Athabascans are in northwestern North America, although<br>
they made it as far south as the Mexican border; the Navajo are Athabascan.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Is there evidence that they crossed Asia to reach western</i><br>
<i>&gt;europe? Is this archeologically prior to the aryan migration?</i><br>
<p>
No evidence I'm aware of, other than easier travel via the land route and the<br>
remaining language isolates in Siberia.  Yes, it's thousands of years prior<br>
to the Aryan migration - something like 6000 or 8000 BC.<br>
