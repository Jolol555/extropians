<p>
Lowering taxes ??? <br>
<p>
National and Income taxes have been lowered but at the same time govt<br>
spending has increased. The way the Netherlands has been able to do this:<br>
<p>
-Privatizing govt owned services/industries. (=basically selling to its<br>
population what they already payed for)   <br>
-Raising special taxes &amp; fines. (using health and environment as an<br>
excuse), and focussing police effort on fining petty violations of the law<br>
that generate income, while real crimes are left unpunished, as they know<br>
the violators can't *pay* for their crimes anyway. (local corps commanders<br>
get a percentage on speeding/parking tickets...) <br>
-Increasing local taxes, local govt's need to increasingly fund their own<br>
areas expenses.<br>
<p>
So no real tax decrease, just a shift in how state income is generated. <br>
<p>
With any gov't wether it has a more social or a more economically liberal<br>
policy, it's what they do with the money they take from its people, for its<br>
people. <br>
<p>
What the netherlands last governement has done is take away more from its<br>
people (higher fines for petty law violations without an increase in crime<br>
prevention, higher special taxes, higher local taxes, lowering the<br>
healthcare budget, lowering the education budget) while expanding its power<br>
over those people (more governement jobs).    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That they do, average-income maybe lower than in the US. But it's not like</i><br>
<i>&gt;we're poor.</i><br>
<p>
No that is true, but we also have no "filthy rich" because they're smart<br>
enough to move to tax paradises. Even higher middle class people are off<br>
better living in neighbouring countries, which is why the netherlands has<br>
such a high tax refugee rate. (talk about solidarity). All kinds of<br>
obligated social security laws, have led to firms paying even their<br>
admistrative employees through all kind of benefits, to keep the taxable<br>
income as low as possible. (more solidarity ?) <br>
<p>
The people who pay for the countries solidarity are the working man, and<br>
the lower middle class, as they do not have a tax advisor who can decrease<br>
their taxable income, and don't pay enough of their income to make it<br>
economically interesting to live accross the border. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I realize that it's not a good thing to say 'It's so great here' </i><br>
<p>
Every country is a great country to live in if you're the average citizen<br>
in everything (Aristotle already said this for most societies). The<br>
Netherlands maybe the most averaged out country in europe, no extremes in<br>
wealth and poverty, no extremes in political opinion, no extremes<br>
whatsoever in anything. Yet if you compare every european country to the<br>
'big brother' visions, it may be the country that comes closest to it.<br>
Criticism of the gov't/state must be near zero on a european index of 100,<br>
voting participation one of the lowest. Public opinion is controlled by two<br>
major publishers, and the gov't media. People look to the state to fix all<br>
their petty problems for them, while having no insight or interest<br>
whatsoever in real issues.   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;- You can never find a parking space (I hear - I do not own a car yet ;-)</i><br>
<p>
Which isn't so strange, if you realize that parking tickets  finance our<br>
police depts, and most parking spaces are gov't property. It's like this<br>
town here in Belgium who's major owns most of the parking spaces in the<br>
town... <br>
(btw, i don't own a car either, it's not the car that costs money, it's the<br>
outrageous taxes on fuel, car taxes &amp; the obligated insurance fees, ...but<br>
also the repair costs ;) )<br>
<p>
btw. It's not such a bad idea to start your own company in European<br>
countries, where luxury tax is around 20% on everything you buy as a<br>
consumer. (I would have, if i could only explain to the tax inspector that<br>
i need food, coffee and cigarettes to work... ;) ) <br>
