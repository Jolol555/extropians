I really laughed.... that's funny... and  very lucrative...( I say this<br>
'cause I know you're kidding...)<br>
But, being a little luciferian (I found this in my "New Michaellis"<br>
dictionary, just knew it in portuguese and archaic latin... hehehe) :<br>
wouldn't you buy some hearts or kidneys and keep them on your freezer, just<br>
for guarantee... ??? <br>
Of course it was a joke, but why not each person having a pretty and frozen<br>
heart of a dead dear friend in a hired organs bank's shelf,  just waiting<br>
for the day......&gt;&gt;&gt; Ans: Because of Global Ignorance (~= Religion &lt;with<br>
death...&gt; ) ...  What about a "Post Modern Anti Inquisition", with torches<br>
and all, burning some religious...(of course,  taking off their good organs,<br>
before ... the brains, if found, may  let to burn, nor even like dog food<br>
they are useful... hehe) ?  &lt;just joking, for not crying..&gt; Note: I'm not<br>
even considering cryogeny... it's very modern...<br>
