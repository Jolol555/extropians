Right.  It's getting that free market to exist, and stay extant, and not<br>
get taken over by organized crime, that's the tricky part.  <br>

Uh... If we were all equal in productive power there would be no<br>
diversity in productive power, yes.  Nothing obviously wrong with that,<br>
as far as I can tell.  In fact, some nanotech visions involve exactly<br>
that: equal wealth because everyone has a totipotent general assembler.<br>
Equality of wealth in the past has been correlated with poverty or the<br>
specialized wealth of hunter-gatherers.  This could change.<br>
