I think the best historical model is Japan, but the French<br>
and Russian revolutions seem to follow this model also.<br>

<i>&gt; corporations adapt fast enough, or will the break up?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Corporate adaptivity is an enormous problem. If corporations<br>
cannot adapt quickly enough, the economy could fail<br>
catastrophically. However, I believe that the financial system<br>
is even more vulnerable to rapid change, and that most individual<br>
humans are more vulnerable still. In particular, until quite<br>
recently, an individual who learned his or her parent's skills<br>
could find a job. Today, I would be unemployable if my skill set<br>
was limited to the skills I had ten years ago. Thus, historical<br>
analogy is of limited usefulness here.<br>
<p>
If there is any interest in this subject, perhaps we could set<br>
up an outline and decide what subtopics should be investigated.<br>
Alternatively, we can just free-flow as we usually do, but in<br>
about a week we can summarize and then fill in the gaps.<br>
individual humans. for most<br>
