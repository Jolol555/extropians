Anton Sherwood:<br>

<i>&gt;: Again, I am sorry for your bad experiences as a child, and I think </i><br>
<i>&gt;: that most of us can share the same type of story.  I do not, however, </i><br>
<i>&gt;: equate that experience with general childhood disputes. </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Can it be separated from them?</i><br>
<p>
Definitely the skill bases to deal with both levels of confrontation <br>
overlap, and a child more skilled in basic assertiveness and <br>
negotiation may deal more effectively with a bully.  I used to do <br>
trainings in peacekeeping skills, and many persons (including myself) <br>
have been able to apply those skills in dangerous or threatening <br>
situations.  <br>
<p>
I wouldn't claim that you can always bargain your way <br>
out of every bad situation, but my original point didn't require me <br>
to claim that.  There is a vast difference between ordinary <br>
socialization into cultural dispute resolution mechanisms and facing <br>
a gang attack.  If anything, the gang members and bullies are the ones <br>
who missed out on part of that socialization process, and they don't feel <br>
subject to school authority anyway, as evidenced by their blatant <br>
behavior.  I would not agree that they are produced by the school <br>
environment as part of some "submission to authority" process--their <br>
problems were probably formed in the home environment.<br>
