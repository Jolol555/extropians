If I didn't say, I should have said: the figures I saw were in the AU<br>
range; Earth's orbit, or maybe Jupiter's.  Carl also noted that his GRB<br>
energies were less than that of supernovae, although the numbers below<br>
look bigger.<br>
<p>
No, they use ergs, and I think Carl used watts.  Or Joules.  I forget.<br>
<p>
In other words, we should be grateful if most of a supernova's energy<br>
goes into neutrinos.  But I'm not sure what "most" means.  50%?  90%?<br>
99%?  A factor of 2 or 3 isn't that much, and implies that GRB's aren't<br>
galactically deadly, since their gamma output would be equivalent to a<br>
supernova, and we've had lots of those in this galaxy.  Not near by, but<br>
they haven't sterilized everything.  (Unless that's the Filter, and<br>
we're the lucky ones.)<br>
<p>
Guessing wildly that a supernova is deadly within 100 ly, if a GRB had<br>
100 times the gamma output that would give 1000 ly killing radius.  (I'm<br>
assuming inverse square applies.)<br>
<p>
Urrrn.  If supernovae are deadly in 100 ly, shouldn't Sirius be frying<br>
us in a few million years?<br>
<p>
Perspective: the main shock seems to be that we see these GRBs from<br>
across the universe.  But I've heard that supernovae can outshine their<br>
host galaxy.  If a galaxy is visible from across the universe then so<br>
are supernovae, and these GRBs aren't that big a deal.  They're just<br>
different and purer.<br>
<p>
Or perhaps more frequent, since I haven't heard of a supernova every<br>
week.<br>

16 billion light years!  Do Hubble constant calculations agree with<br>
this?  Not to mention cosmo-evolutionary models?  Although the stars<br>
that form neutron stars and black holes don't last very long, once<br>
formed.<br>
<p>
Hypothesis: massive first generation of stars.  All go supernova and<br>
make neutron stars.  Sometime later, neutron stars run into each other.<br>
Boom.  If we'd been earlier we'd have seen lots of supernovae scattered<br>
around the universe; we're later, so we see the second movement of the<br>
death-dance.  Happily surrounded by red dwarfs ourselves.<br>

Cross-posted to extropians for maximum criticism.<br>

Reliability: low.  I trust the supernova-neutrino calculations.  I<br>
careened on the comparisons.<br>

"The really ironic issue of late has been supercomputer exports. We now<br>
have the spectacle of William Reinsch saying that export restrictions<br>
on supercomputer *hardware* are unworkable because the technology is<br>
available all around the world.<br>
<p>
This is the very same Commerce official who still says with a straight<br>
face that export controls on encryption *software* are workable and<br>
desirable."<br>
