I've been trying to do the exact same thing.  The problems I find are: trying<br>
to be optimistic and still hold the attention of todays audience (who have<br>
been made to believe genetic engineering will create mosters and AI's will<br>
eat their children) and trying to present highly complex, world changing<br>
technologies in a way the audience would understand.  For instance, how do<br>
you show nano-technology or uploading in a movie (without resorting to "I can<br>
feel something... something strange... entering... my... body... something<br>
small... almost nanoscopical in size" or "as you can see, virtual reality<br>
technology has progressed so far that everything in here looks _exactly_ like<br>
it does in the real world!").<br>
