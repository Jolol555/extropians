In a message dated 97-07-12 17:59:26 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; A true anarcho-libertarian society wouldn't have corporations, since<br>
 they are products of the state, chartered and protected by them. True<br>
 capitalism is one without corporations. Abolish the laws that establish<br>
 corporations and even though you may still get big powerful companies,<br>
 its owners would be directly responsible for their actions.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
correct me if I'm wrong but isn't this the situation which existed prior to<br>
the "Trust Busters" of the Teddy Roosevelt era?  I always thought that<br>
corporations were creatures of the U.S. Tax code...which effectively<br>
eliminated the ability of INDIVIDUALS to accumulate the amounts of wealth<br>
necessary for industrial applications.<br>
<p>
And another thing...what's WRONG with the concept of a corporation...why<br>
would anarchists not like it?<br>
