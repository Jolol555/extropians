Subject: Opening Volley fired on "Good Morning America" by anti-Cassini <br>
forces<br>
<p>
<p>
FYI -- The first volley was fired in the mainstream media during one of <br>
the<br>
morning news programs.<br>
<p>
During today's segment of "Good Morning America,"  Dr. Michio Kaku from <br>
the<br>
City University of New York debated Beverly Cook from the Department of<br>
Energy over the merits of launching Cassini next month.  Charlie Gibson<br>
served as moderator between the two.<br>
<p>
Dr. Kaku, a nuclear physicist, is an opponent of Cassini, favoring a <br>
solar<br>
power redesign, arguing that "Saturn will still be there, it was there <br>
for<br>
Galileo (the man, not the probe, I presume)."  He also managed to <br>
mention his<br>
recently published book in the first thirty seconds of his opening <br>
comments.<br>
<p>
Beverly Cook held her own during her comments, although Dr. Kaku was <br>
given<br>
the opening and closing statements.<br>
<p>
Charlie Gibson appeared a bit skeptical regarding Dr. Kaku's comments.  <br>
He<br>
even got a concession out of Dr. Kaku that despite his claim "Titan IV's <br>
have<br>
a 1 in 20 failure rate" (never mind that the Titan IVB to be used is<br>
different from all previous vehicles), it didn't mean that the RTG would <br>
be<br>
destroyed in an explosion.<br>
<p>
In the meantime, here's the latest out of Russell Hoffman's "Stop <br>
Cassini"<br>
Newsletter that you might want to review.<br>

Hi!<br>
<p>
In the last two weeks I have heard the phrase "I think we actually have <br>
a<br>
chance of stopping Cassini" a number of times.  I had never heard that<br>
before -- sometimes I thought only I believed it!  But now I hear it <br>
over<br>
and over.  Something's changing in the wind.  America the giant is <br>
waking<br>
up.  Many Americans now oppose Cassini, Republicans and Democrats, <br>
Leftists<br>
and Conservatives, well-educated Americans, smart Americans, and, <br>
uh...me.<br>
<p>
Folks, we really have a movement going!  It is dreadfully disorganized, <br>
with<br>
many isolated individuals and small groups acting alone, but it is<br>
definitely a movement!  And the pro-nuclear Cassini people are getting <br>
vocal<br>
as well.  Congressman Dave Weldon is the representative from the Cape<br>
Canaveral district.  Not surprisingly, he has recently sent a letter to <br>
his<br>
colleagues "explaining" how safe Cassini is and how unconcerned he is <br>
with<br>
the dangers.<br>
<p>
In this issue we answer that letter and give other current news items <br>
about<br>
the STOP CASSINI MOVEMENT!<br>
<p>
Sincerely, Russell D. Hoffman, Editor, STOP CASSINI newsletter.<br>

We are in a lot of grapevines these days regarding Cassini, and several <br>
of<br>

U.S. REPRESENTATIVE DAVE WELDON<br>

<p>
NASA's CASSINI MISSION TO SATURN IS SAFE<br>
<p>
Dear Colleague:<br>
<p>
Undoubtedly you have heard about NASA's upcoming Cassini mission to<br>
Saturn, which is scheduled to be launched in October.  It is an unmanned<br>
probe that will explore Saturn and its mysterious moon, Titan, in<br>
greater detail than ever before possible.  Cassini is an international<br>
project that is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California<br>
and will be launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, which is the in the<br>
heart of my district.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, the news reports that you have heard about Cassini<br>
probably did not focus on its ambitious scientific objectives, or the<br>
international cooperation, or the engineering genius behind a probe that<br>
will be operating nearly autonomously 1.4 billion kilometers away from<br>
Earth.  Instead, there are some fringe organizations that are opposing<br>
the use of nuclear power for Cassini's on-board equipment.<br>
<p>
Cassini does not use a nuclear reactor, but rather a set of special<br>
generators that take the heat given off by the natural decay of small<br>
pellets of plutonium-238 and convert it to electricity.  This is similar<br>
to the system used by previous deep-space probes.  Additionally, all of<br>
the radioactive material on board will be used essentially as batteries,<br>
not for propulsion.  The propulsion system is ordinary chemical rockets<br>
that have been used for decades.<br>
<p>
If there were any significant public threats posed by this mission, you<br>
can be certain that I would be the first to protest it.  I have family<br>
and friends that live and work near the launch site, and I would never<br>
allow their lives to be endangered.<br>
<p>
There are many arguments used by Cassiniÿs opponents, all of which can<br>
be quickly and accurately refuted by NASA.  In fact, opponents have<br>
planned events in Washington over the next few weeks to pressure elected<br>
officials to oppose Cassini, and I would encourage you to get the facts<br>
about the mission before drawing any premature conclusions.  NASA's<br>
Legislative Affairs office (358-1055) can provide you or your staff with<br>
detailed data, or you can visit the Cassini World Wide Web site at<br>
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini">http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini</a>.<br>
<p>
Cassini is an exciting deep-space exploration mission, and I hope you<br>
will join me in supporting this important NASA program.<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
<p>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; END OF EMAIL TO US SHOWING REP. DAVE WELDON'S EMAIL &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MY RESPONSE: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
Hi!<br>
<p>
Thanks for sending me this piece of pro-nuclear Cassini propaganda <br>
(shown<br>
above).<br>
<p>
Fringe?  This Congressman needs an education in who is really opposing<br>
Cassini!  Or does he actually dare to call Dr. John Gofman or Dr. Michio<br>
Kaku "fringe"?  These men are among the world's leading nuclear <br>
scientists!<br>
Fringe?  It is a sad day for science when a congressman such as Dave <br>
Weldon<br>
would speak ill of scientists like these gentleman.  I dare Dave Weldon <br>
to<br>
read aloud before the public the biographies of John Gofman or Michio <br>
Kaku<br>
and then call them "fringe".  They are pillars of scientific reason and <br>
true<br>
American icons.<br>
<p>
And as for getting the facts from an organization that won't argue the<br>
facts, won't link to the opposition, and won't tell the truth, how can <br>
one<br>
claim that NASA presents a fair opposition to Cassini?  They cannot even<br>
keep their own "facts" straight from one report to another, let alone<br>
actually tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.<br>
<p>
NASA has not "quickly and accurately refuted" the charges we have <br>
brought<br>
against it.  Not nearly. Not even close.<br>
<p>
Thanks again for sending me this,<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Russell Hoffman<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; END OF MY RESPONSE TO REP. DAVE WELDON'S EMAIL &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>

*** NPR Science Friday Gangs up Against Michio Kaku<br>
*****************************************************<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS JUST IN FROM MARK ELSIS &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The NPR Science Friday segment was an 18:10 minute segment.  After a <br>
brief<br>
introduction by Ira Flatow, Beverly Cook from DOE talked for 2:35 then<br>
another guy on that side (a biophysicist from the University of <br>
California<br>
at Davis) talked from 2:35 to 4:15.  Michio Kaku then talked from 4:15 <br>
to<br>
7:25, then BC 7:25 to 9:25 again, then about a 5 second break, then 9:30 <br>
to<br>
11:00 MK again, BC 11:00 to 11:45 (MK  broke in for one comment for <br>
about 3<br>
or 4 seconds during this period) then the other guy from 11:45 to 13:30 <br>
(MK<br>
broke in once more for a 3 to 4 second comment).  Then Ira Flatow spoke <br>
from<br>
13:30 to 14:10 then BC again from 14:10 to 15:20, then MK complained <br>
about<br>
not being able to present his side and talked from 15:20 to 16:10 then <br>
BC<br>
broke in from 16:10 to 16:25, then MK from 16:25 to 16:40. Michio Kaku <br>
was<br>
saying that NASA is living in a fantasy land when they say that <br>
plutonium is<br>
not such a terribly toxic substance.  He said what he is trying to do is<br>
save NASA from NASA's own administrators. At 16:40 the other guy comes <br>
in<br>
until 17:10, then ALL THREE talk over each other from 17:10 to 17:50, <br>
they<br>
jab back and forth, then Ira breaks in and says that's the end of the <br>
show.<br>
THEN HE LETS BEVERLY COOK speak for 20 more seconds and then they played <br>
an<br>
extended musical interlude for several minutes, when Michio Kaku could <br>
have<br>
refuted the corporate/government line that the others were presenting.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; END ANALYSIS FROM MARK ELSIS &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
Three cheers for Kaku!  <br>
<p>
NPR has some serious questions to answer about how it could possibly<br>
consider itself an alternative voice of the people. This was without<br>
question the most controversial news item of the week and Kaku was given<br>
less than half the time that NASA's proponents got.  He was not allowed <br>
a<br>
summation, the show was cut short for no known reason, and there were of<br>
course, two (or was it three) to one...  Doesn't NASA get enough <br>
unedited<br>
press coverage from CNN and all the others?  Does NPR have to bow to the<br>
corporate/government line too?  <br>
<p>
This week, following a week when the worst elements of the press are <br>
being<br>
condemned around the world for their role in chasing down Princess Diana <br>
one<br>
final time, the rest of the press should step back and ask themselves:  <br>
Have<br>
I reported fairly on the most important topics the world faced this <br>
week?<br>
Have I done my share to teach the world the truth, to present to them <br>
all<br>
legitimate arguments of both sides, and to see that justice in the court <br>
of<br>
public opinion can be done?  Have I helped give the public the facts it<br>
needs to decide?  Have I done this today?<br>
<p>
News is what the public needs to know, nothing more, and nothing less.<br>

*** An Introduction To Horst A. Poehler, Ph. D.<br>
*****************************************************<br>
<p>
Dr. Horst Poehler has written an exellent article about Cassini Cancers<br>
which we have posted at the web site at this URL:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.animatedsoftware.com/cassini/hp9708ps.htm">http://www.animatedsoftware.com/cassini/hp9708ps.htm</a><br>
<p>
Here is a brief biography of Dr. Poehler.  As you can see he is (yet<br>
another!) scientist opposed to Cassini who SHOULD know what he is <br>
talking<br>
about, and certainly, it appears to me that he DOES know what he is <br>
talking<br>
about.<br>
<p>

*** Media Book Recently Distributed <br>
*****************************************************<br>
<p>
We recently created a book which is a sample of our STOP CASSINI web <br>
site,<br>
and a description of the webmaster.  Although the book only contains <br>
perhaps<br>
5% of the entire web site, it was still nearly 100 pages long!<br>
<p>
We distributed 50 copies to media and to the Congresspeople whom we have<br>
heard are helping us call for Congressional hearings -- Lynn Woosley, <br>
Pete<br>
Stark, Ron Dellums, George Miller, and Bernard Sanders.  We sent each of<br>
these Congresspersons two copies -- one to give to a colleague.  The <br>
cost of<br>
sending the entire web site to each Congressperson appears prohibitive.<br>
Fortunately they can, if they care to, read it online (where it is <br>
better<br>
organized anyway than a printed version could ever be) and we sincerely <br>
hope<br>
some of them will.<br>
<p>
Congresspeople need to hear from their constituents, not some "fringe<br>
activist" from outside their district!  We encourage everyone to print <br>
out<br>
anything from our web site or from other STOP CASSINI web sites and send<br>
that in, along with their own comments.  We will of course cheerfully<br>
attempt to answer any Congressperson's questions or direct them to <br>
documents<br>
and/or experts which can answer their questions.  But in any case the <br>
first<br>
steps need to come from voters in their own districts and states.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TEXT OF COVER LETTER FOR MEDIA BOOK &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
STOP CASSINI WEB SITE<br>
<p>
NEWS MEDIA TOUR GUIDE<br>
<p>
The STOP CASSINI WEB SITE was started in January, 1997 and has grown to<br>
nearly 100 articles and newsletters, and numerous scanned GIF images of <br>
NASA<br>
documentation.  It was created by computer programmer Russell Hoffman, <br>
and<br>
represents thousands of hours of research time and effort. <br>
<p>
As word spread around the globe, the web site became noticed by the<br>
pro-nuclear Cassini side and a number of debates ensued which were <br>
carried<br>
on in the web site's newsletter (now in its 37th issue).  These debates<br>
argue the logic of NASA's decisions regarding the use of plutonium "RTG"<br>
power sources.  In virtually all cases the pro-nuclear sides' arguments <br>
are<br>
presented in their entirety, including a long-running debate with Louis<br>
Friedman, Executive Director of the Planetary Society, and with Jim<br>
Spellman, President, California Space Development Council and Executive<br>
Director, NSS/Western Spaceport Chapter, as well as many others. <br>
<p>
The crux of the debate is not whether NASA is right or wrong or the<br>
anti-nuclear Cassini people are right or wrong, because in fact, right <br>
now<br>
we have little way of telling if either side's "worst-case predictions" <br>
are<br>
correct!  What is argued instead in the newsletters and at the web site <br>
is:<br>
First, that NASA cannot possibly KNOW FOR CERTAIN which of the many<br>
statements which they present as fact, are in fact, facts.  Second, <br>
NASA's<br>
own statements often are contradictory, misleading, or patently false <br>
when<br>
compared to their own literature.  This is unscientific and profoundly<br>
disturbing behavior on NASA's part. <br>
<p>
The web site contains articles by Karl Grossman, Michio Kaku, Ross <br>
McCluney,<br>
Ross Wilcock, Perry Keidel, Chris Bryson, Michael Bein and others and<br>
transcripts of speeches by Michio Kaku and Alan Kohn, as well as remarks <br>
by<br>
John Gofman, Ernest Sternglass, Jay Gould, Helen Caldicott, and Karl Z.<br>
Morgan and others.  Protest schedules and launch schedules are published <br>
at<br>
the web site, petitions are presented for signatures, and letters which <br>
can<br>
be sent to President Clinton, Al Gore, and others are also presented.  <br>
Much<br>
of this material has since been republished elsewhere and some of the<br>
material was originally published elsewhere, but most of the web site is<br>
comprised of original essays published directly on the web.  The <br>
webmaster<br>
admits to being outspoken, feisty, and passionate about the cause - and<br>
occasionally wrong as well, but he has done his best to present <br>
everything<br>
he can about the issues involved.<br>
<p>
In this printed book is a very small sample of the STOP CASSINI web site <br>
-<br>
about 5% of the total.  The items include the official communication <br>
with<br>
NASA regarding their EIS reports.  NASA has not officially commented on <br>
the<br>
web site to the webmaster, but he has heard from several sources that <br>
they<br>
have spoken disparagingly of it to others and are "reluctant" to appear <br>
in a<br>
debate with the webmaster.  We are not, however, calling on NASA to <br>
debate<br>
or respond to the web site.  We are calling for Congressional Hearings <br>
so<br>
that any and all statements made by both sides will be the sworn truth <br>
as<br>
they see it.  At the same time, we call on all America, from schools and<br>
colleges to workplace lunch cafeterias to CSPAN and all the news media <br>
to<br>
debate this issue.  Not just Cassini, which is NASA's great new folly, <br>
but<br>
the entire cost of the nuclear nightmare the world faces on Earth and <br>
now in<br>
space as well. <br>
<p>
At the end of the book  is some information about the professional work <br>
of<br>
STOP CASSINI webmaster and newsletter editor, Russell D. Hoffman. <br>
Although<br>
Mr. Hoffman has reduced his workload in other projects this year to do <br>
the<br>
STOP CASSINI project (for the first time in about 18 years) he feels <br>
that<br>
the learning experience of how to use the World Wide Web to disseminate<br>
information will result in better and more exciting future educational<br>
projects for him to work on. The web is wonderful and must remain a <br>
place<br>
for the free and proper discourse of important public policy decisions <br>
such<br>
as CASSINI.<br>
