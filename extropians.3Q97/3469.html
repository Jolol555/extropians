Quick note....very interesting topic...<br>
<p>
It seems to me that once again the problem is government..(standard EvMick<br>
Mantra)...if "hard" money instead of fiat money were in operation then all<br>
the abovementioned problems would take care of themselves. The relative<br>
values of goods and services would automatically shift and compensate<br>
dynamically.  Course no one would be in Control...and if you screwed up you<br>
GET screwed...(mother nature is a bitch)..but the Fed hasn't impressed<br>
me...seems like they cause more problems than they cure...just skew the cause<br>
and effect relationship so NOONE knows what's going on.  <br>
<p>
And using fisical policy for social engineering purposess sucks.<br>
<p>
I'm really intrigued  with the concept that "money"( as well as "language"<br>
and everything else that people have and animals don't have) is an<br>
invention....would be interested in discussion on this.<br>
