GREAT NEW FREEDOM LIST<br>
<p>
My apologies to everyone on the Extropy list<br>
for attempting to launch the NSPIC debate on<br>
your list.  I apologize for wasting your time<br>
and any discomfort, irritation, or resentment<br>
that may have resulted.<br>
<p>
Though the "debate" would have been a disaster<br>
in any case, when Jim Legg tried to hijack it,<br>
it became a double disaster.  And when WesBurt<br>
tried to jump on the "non-bandwagon," it became<br>
a triple disaster.<br>
<p>
Nevertheless, in a sense, it was a great success<br>
because it led to my realization that an e-mail<br>
list tends to form a kind of "intellectual space."<br>
And some may have perceived my attempted debate<br>
as an "invasion."  I apologize for this.  However,<br>
the greatest benefit of my "abject failure" is<br>
that it inspired the design of the Advanced<br>
Freedom Solutions list.<br>
<p>
Anyone interested in continuing the NSPIC debate<br>
is welcome to subscribe to the Advanced Freedom<br>
Solutions List.  Someone who has spent 50 years<br>
studying the effects of language has indicated<br>
that he will participate in the NSPIC debate.<br>
<p>
You may also find some other "goodies" on the<br>
AFS list.<br>

ADVANCED FREEDOM SOLUTIONS LIST<br>
-------------------------------<br>
<p>
The Advanced Freedom Solutions List has been<br>
created for those interested in creative,<br>
innovative, and poweful ways to enjoy more<br>
freedom and to turn their freedom expertise<br>
into advantages in all areas of life.<br>
<p>
The list has several "discussion categories":<br>
<p>
* Practical Freedom (how to live as free as<br>
	possible in an unfree world; how to<br>
	outwit freedom-violators).<br>
<p>
* Fiscal Freedom (practical ways to deal with<br>
	taxes and social security).<br>
<p>
* Economic Means to Freedom (how freedom-lovers<br>
	can increase their wealth and use their<br>
	economic power to expand freedom).<br>
<p>
* Freedom Business Networking (link up with<br>
	freedom-oriented people and businesses;<br>
	free website listing in Directory of<br>
	Freedom Businesses).<br>
<p>
* Expert Solutions Support (submit any problem<br>
	to receive expert advice).<br>
<p>
* Language of Freedom (how to use language to<br>
	increase your own freedom and assist<br>
	others to do the same).<br>
<p>
* Health Freedom &amp; Life Extension (it would be<br>
	advantageous for freedom-lovers to lead<br>
	very healthy and very long lives).<br>
<p>
* Freedom Psychology (improving thinking skills<br>
	and increasing intelligence; removing<br>
	psychological and emotional barriers to<br>
	freedom, success, wealth, and happiness).<br>
<p>
* Personal Power and Influence (how to expand<br>
	to new levels of power and influence).<br>
<p>
* Marketing Freedom (powerful ways to spread<br>
	freedom more rapidly).<br>
<p>
* Freedom Advantages (how to apply freedom<br>
	expertise to give you advantages in all<br>
	areas of life).<br>
