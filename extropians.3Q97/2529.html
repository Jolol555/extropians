In a message dated 97-08-24 20:48:11 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; There was a letter to Nature a few months ago that discussed the<br>
possiblity<br>
 of life spreading throughout the galaxy via the spread of spores. The idea<br>
 was that a sizeable impact with Earth, or like body, would put some spores<br>
 into space. I can't remember the details, but the idea was that if you<br>
 assume a small piece of soot with spores inside you could expect them to<br>
 survive millions of years. Once in space they would slowly spread outwards<br>
 from the sun under the pressure of solar radiation until they perhaps<br>
 reached another solar system and fell to a planet with suitable conditions;<br>
 where they could start the process of life all over, or perhaps out compete<br>
 whatever organisms had evolved separately.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
Terence McKenna uses that argument to suggest that intelligence was<br>
transported to this earth via psychedelic mushroom spores.<br>
