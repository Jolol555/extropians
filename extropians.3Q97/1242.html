I read an interesting science fiction short story last year about<br>
an old man, of our generation, struggling to deal with the changes in<br>
technology which had occured during his lifetime.  In their society they<br>
had established a way to access parallel worlds to a limited extent.<br>
This had opened up a lot of technologies, including a virtually unlimited<br>
source of energy based on some kind of differential between the universes.<br>
<p>
Current QM models say it will be impossible to access the parallel Everett<br>
universes, but if non-linearities are ever introduced it might become<br>
theoretically possible.  I don't know about the energy part, but it would<br>
certainly be of tremendous philosophical impact to learn that parallel<br>
worlds are real, and perhaps even to be able to communicate with them.<br>
<p>
You could conceivably talk to dead relatives, you could see how your<br>
life might have been different if you had taken other choices, you could<br>
get the effects of quantum computing, access works of art by people who<br>
never succeeded in this universe.  It would truly turn things upside down.<br>
(Larry Niven had a story in which such a discovery led to nihilism and<br>
depression, but I think the consequences would be more complex.)<br>
