Yes, I mean thousands of years of work by good scientists and engineers.<br>

Boy, you must be a philosopher or something.  It's clear you've never done<br>
any engineering (:-).  I will respond with three points: (1)<br>
self-reproducing machines are comarable in difficulty to other technologies<br>
that required thousands of genius-years to develop, (2) simulation is not<br>
enough, and (3) Drexler hasn't done much.<br>
<p>
(1) The minimum self-reproducing device (mycoplasma genitalium) seems to<br>
require about a million bits of information.  I don't think we'll be able to<br>
get much smaller than that with our artificial equivalents.  That's about as<br>
much information as is embodied in a car or medium-size piece of software.<br>
To develop from having no experience in automotive technology whatever to<br>
the point where you can build a reasonably effective car took at least<br>
thousands of genius-years.  Ditto software.  The first piece of software<br>
that I'm aware of that was over a million bits long was OS/360, developed in<br>
1964, at a cost of 5000 man-years, to say nothing of all the research that<br>
it took to bring software technology to the point where they could even<br>
start the project. <br>
<p>
(2) Simulation doesn't solve the problem, because reality always holds<br>
surprises.  In the software business, any piece of software can be simulated<br>
with arbitrary precision, because to run it is to simulate it.  Does this<br>
imply software can be made perfect?  No, because the world around the<br>
software is incapable of being precisely simulated.  I just checked, and 26%<br>
of the software project I'm currently working on is test code, essentially<br>
designed to simulate the loads the real users will put on the system.  And<br>
will that make our product bug-free?  Fat chance!  You have to put it out in<br>
the world, watch it break, figure out what happened, and redesign it.  All<br>
these steps are hard.<br>
<p>
(3) Drexler and Merkle are two very (very!) smart guys.  They have labored<br>
for years, and designed what?  Some bearings, a transmission, a PLA, and a<br>
Stewart platform?  And you claim this shows how easy it is?  I'd hate to see<br>
an engineering task you considered hard!  If we keep working at this rate,<br>
we should see a complete assembler in around a millenium.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	As you point out, each partial achievment would bring great benefits </i><br>
<i>&gt;to the power that makes it, so wouldn't this mean that it would have </i><br>
<i>&gt;a good chance of pushing further ahead, leaving the competition </i><br>
<i>&gt;behind?</i><br>
<p>
This assumes that it is possible to acquire the massive resources needed to<br>
develop the next generation without letting anyone know how the current<br>
generation works, or even that it works.  I would suggest that this is<br>
impossible, since the resources have to be gathered either by selling<br>
products or extortion by threats of violence.  Both of these are highly<br>
visible activities.  As soon as the world realizes that there is massive<br>
power to be had, everyone will work like crazy to catch up.  Companies other<br>
than Ford make cars, and countries other than Britain use railroads.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	If superinelligence (that could perform a thousand genius years in a </i><br>
<i>&gt;short time) comes before nanotech, or is developed at an early stage </i><br>
<i>&gt;of nanotech, then the bottle neck would almost certainly be the </i><br>
<i>&gt;hardware, the molecular tools, and in such a case the maturation </i><br>
<i>&gt;process would be almost instantaneous.</i><br>
<p>
I entirely agree.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(2), given slow </i><br>
<i>&gt;maturation, will that mean that a multipolar world order can remain </i><br>
<i>&gt;stable?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(2)</i><br>
<i>&gt;I believe the answer to the second question is No. I think there </i><br>
<i>&gt;would either be a negotiated merger, or the stronger power would </i><br>
<i>&gt;obliterate the weaker, and then immediately rebuild itself, and then </i><br>
<i>&gt;expand spherically at a good fraction of the light speed.</i><br>
<p>
There is at least one other possibility, and it is the one that keeps the<br>
world system stable: the cost of subduing the smaller power is more than the<br>
profit obtained from its submission.  Please explain why an imbalance in<br>
nanotech is more likely to make this solution infeasible than does an<br>
imbalance in e.g. nuclear missiles, or iron swords.  Nanotech makes the cost<br>
of conquest smaller, but also reduces the profit of conquest, since<br>
everything gets so much cheaper with nanotech.  What are you going to get<br>
from your conquered enemies?  Natuaral resources?  Go to the asteroid belt!<br>
Lebensraum?  Well, that's OK if you like scorched earth.  I'd rather have my<br>
own O'Niell colony.  A nation of slaves?  Oh boy, they'll sure be an<br>
economic bonanza.  <br>
<p>
I'm being sarcastic here, perhaps more than I should be, but I genuinely<br>
don't see the payoff to instantaneous extermination of foriegners through<br>
nanotech, espescially when your enemies will have at least nuclear weapons<br>
and at best nanotech only one generation behind your own.  <br>
