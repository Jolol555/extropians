To be technical, Medline provides the abstracts from journals rather than<br>
being a journal itself.  Your proposal is for the Journal of Futuristic<br>
Hypotheses.<br>

I don't think scientific journals are run as profit centers.  Primarily, they<br>
serve for information exchange amongst people who need that information to do<br>
their jobs.  Readers pay enough to get the things published because they need<br>
that information so badly.  People participate for the prestige, for<br>
"publish-or-perish", and out of the desire to spread their ideas.<br>
<p>
The discussions on this list often reasonably approximate peer review.<br>
 Getting reviewers wouldn't be a problem.  My question is what would people<br>
use such a resource for?  I can't see much use for it myself other than my<br>
own personal enjoyment, and the model of scientific journals indicates you<br>
need more use than that to get the thing going.<br>
