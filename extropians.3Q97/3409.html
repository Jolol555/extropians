I tried to point out to Holly that extropy is not a secret. We are not<br>
hoarding arcane wisdom from the Ancients. There is no system of degrees<br>
or initiation. ExI is a public organization. This is a public list. Some<br>
people are not cut out for distributing memes among the masses. But some<br>
people are. Rick, you happen to have not only a tactful diplomatic<br>
manner, but also a desire to see the meme propogate. I think you would<br>
be a good apologist for extropian transhumanism in the mainstream. <br>
<p>
I've made this point a million times, but I'll make it again. Idealism<br>
without praxis is non-utilitarian. Given that I agree the meme should<br>
propogate, what do we do? Start an organization? Done. Print a magazine?<br>
Done. Stand on the streetcorner and shout loudly? You see my point? Many<br>
list members write books, articles, and web pages. What else should be<br>
done? Maybe a lot more of the same.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I understand your concern. But extropy is new, and different,<br>
and maybe scary to some. It needs to be absorbed over time.<br>
Unfortunately, time may not be what we have given the projected pace of<br>
change.<br>
<p>
