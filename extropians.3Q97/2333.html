        The crucial element that separates those who worship and those who<br>
welcome the singularity is that it takes people to make it happen.  If<br>
everyone were to stop what they were doing, to sit back and worship the<br>
singularity, there would be no singularity.  It takes all technical people<br>
in their respective trades to create such a singularity; if that is<br>
forgotten, the singularity may as well be some deity that is expected to<br>
provide salvation upon such and such a date.  If you want to explain the<br>
concept of the singularity, first start with telling the person or people<br>
*how* a singularity can be created.  Without the human element, it appears<br>
(and is) a totally foreign entity.  Show how such a singularity is the<br>
summation of man's potential.  That is what it is.<br>
