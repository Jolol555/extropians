For the record, I was never worried it was just me, from the instant I noticed<br>
a LONG post under the title Neuro-Selectric Psionical Intrusion Comdex.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The only plausible theory that I have come up with, is that the NSPIC</i><br>
<i>&gt; posts are being run through a rule-based grammar translater that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; generating obtuse sentence structures.  It reminds me of a program that</i><br>
<i>&gt; will take massive quantities of writing and generate random sentences by</i><br>
<i>&gt; looking for phrases and stringing them together.  By hooking together</i><br>
<i>&gt; phrases that overlap by one word, it simulates a continuity of verbage,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but the complete sentences don't convey any real meaning.</i><br>
<p>
As repeated experiments have shown, humans can (accidentally) imitate a<br>
Comskian random generator so well that professors can't tell the difference. <br>
There have been several instances of this, but the one I recall was that<br>
professors of communications theory visited the (randomly generated) "Online<br>
Archive of Semiotics(*)" and couldn't tell the difference.<br>
<p>
Occam's Razor does not force us to postulate random generation.<br>
<p>
(*) = I'm not sure it's "Semiotics".<br>
