Err, I think protecting children from their physical environment is<br>
probably the smaller part of parenting, at least by the time they're age<br>
7 or so.  The main function of raising kids is teaching them, and while<br>
part of that is physically practical stuff, a very large part of<br>
parenting is (or should be) civilizing the brats.  Children do not raise<br>
themselves well.  _Lord of the Flies_ and gangs and all that.  Our<br>
progress in manipulating the physical environment has been coupled with<br>
progress in learning how to get along with each other in pleasant ways,<br>
and a pack of kids isn't going to recapitulate thousands of years of<br>
development in either field without substantial guidance.<br>
