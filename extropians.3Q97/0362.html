Speaking of mythology.... ;)<br>
<p>
This sounds good, but you are forgetting a few key problems with that<br>
scenario:<br>
<p>
1) what's its power source? I suppose it could have a catalytic cold<br>
fusion crystal in it that ran on atmospheric moisture, but we are<br>
talking still about one major problem that even that kind of power<br>
source would not be able to solve:<br>
<p>
COMMUNICATION<br>
<p>
You are expecting a probe the size of a grain of sand to be stealthed,<br>
yet pump out enough power to run a communications device that can<br>
communicate at interstellar distances? Oh PLEASE. The sort of power<br>
density that would demand is huge, millions of years beyond  our<br>
greatest hopes. At that level, such a grain of sand would stick out on a<br>
beach like a spotlight, would probably melt its surrounding material to<br>
glass, and start a fire... hardly a stealthy behavior.<br>
<p>
Here's a fantastic scenario to go with that:<br>
<p>
The grains of sand come down in bunches over an area of a few miles<br>
wide. They survey, store up information, and wait for a storm system to<br>
swing overhead. They use the storm's electrical potential to trigger<br>
lightning strikes that they use to send a tightbeam burst message using<br>
the earths atmosphere as a highpower radio transmitter. The power demand<br>
to accomplish this naturally causes a forest fire that destroys the<br>
probe,and the fire is blamed on lightning.<br>
<p>
WHile this sounds like a fanciful SF story, I think your guys are<br>
thinking too far ahead. Any civilizations first interstellar missions<br>
will not be that much different from our existing space program, i.e.<br>
hiding is not a priority. you think that any aliens must be some<br>
superbeings because in your heart you think that humanity is too stupid<br>
to ever reach other star systems, so if they can get here, they must be<br>
so much better than we are. BS. They will put their pants on pretty much<br>
the same way as we do, and will be just as messed up as individuals as<br>
we are.<br>
