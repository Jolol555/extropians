might be a good place to start (I haven't gone to the lynx, but there seem<br>
to be some good essays there, and useful book titles).  SFWA is Science<br>
Fiction (and Fantasy) Writers of America.<br>
<p>
Really, though, the way to *get it* is just to read lots of good sf - and<br>
good fiction in general - with your pores open.  `Good' has an ostensive<br>
definition, alas, and is not always met by following the common awards such<br>
as the Hugo or even the Nebula.  The John Campbell Memorial Award backlist<br>
is pretty reliable (but not entirely; Gregory Benford beat me by one vote<br>
in 1980, damn it).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And it remains possible to read the Doc Smith operas. </i><br>
<p>
Really?  Whatever contortions you place yourself in, you are stuck with<br>
this kind of sub-literacy (I quote without permission, cringing as I type,<br>
from FIRST LENSMAN, page 1:<br>
<p>
`Blonde, blue-eyed Dr. Nels Bergenholm, completely undisturbed by the<br>
passage of the stream of bullets through his head amd body, turned and<br>
waved one huge hand at the stool beside his own.<br>
	`"But those were not ordinary projectiles!" the visitor protested.  [...]<br>
"They should have volatilized that form of flesh - should at least have<br>
blown you back to Arisia, where you belong."<br>
	`"Ordinary or extraordinary, what matter?  As you, in the guise of Gray<br>
Roger, told Conway Costigan a short time ago...'  [snip as brain frays]<br>
	`"Think you so?" Gharlane sneered.  "You, who have been so afraid of us<br>
for over two thousand million Tellurian years that you dared not let us<br>
even learn of you?..."  [and so on endlessly]<br>
<p>
*Cordwainer* Smith, on the other hand... Ah!  Arthur C. Clarke in the good<br>
old days.  Joanna Russ.  Ursula Le Guin.  Thomas M. Disch.  Gene Wolfe.<br>
Samuel R. Delany.  Roger Zelazny, before he debased himself in silly<br>
costume dramas. Not all of these writers sparkle - Le Guin is rather too<br>
grand and grey and solemn and ethically wonderful - and not all are easy to<br>
read - Chip Delany is increasingly poststructural and ponderous, and<br>
Wolfe's richly arcane vocabulary will drive even the logocentric repeatedly<br>
to the dictionary...  The old literate guys from the 1950s when they<br>
weren't just cranking it out for a penny a word: Theodore Sturgeon, Alfred<br>
Bester, James Blish, Damon Knight.  Such pleasure in their intelligence,<br>
their grace, their disciplined imaginations, their *style*.<br>
