You should have known better.<br>
<p>
I once came up with an entirely reasonable (and experimentally testable)<br>
explanation of astrology - simply to prove to myself that I could prove<br>
anything.  I don't DARE publish it even in the pages of the Skeptical<br>
Inquirer.  Not only would it become the standard explanation, but my mailbox<br>
would be flooded and my phone would be tied up and my life made unlivable by<br>
the National Enquirer and people who simply can't understand the concept of "I<br>
made this up".<br>
<p>
But, you ask, what possible explanation can there be for remote stellar bodies<br>
influencing our personalities?<br>
<p>
And the answer is - that the explanation is completely obvious, and that the<br>
astrologers haven't already thought of it demonstrates how silly they are, and<br>
that I won't tell you.<br>
<p>
But to show I can, I shall now prove four related propositions:<br>
1)  The sky is green.<br>
2)  The sky is purple.<br>
3)  The sky has red polka-dots.<br>
4)  (Generalized:)  The sky is any color.<br>
<p>
1)  Sun is yellow.  Sky is blue.  Yellow + blue = green.<br>
2)  The sky is purple, at night.<br>
3)  The stars are polka-dots.  Some of them are red giants.<br>
4)  There are many planets in the Universe.  Some of them will have skies of<br>
any given color.<br>
<p>
I did not make up the explanations first.  First I made up the propositions,<br>
then I proved them.  Note that every explanation is *true*.  No matter how<br>
ridiculous the propositions may seem, they are quite correct.  If I'd shown<br>
you those propositions and told you I was going to prove them, you would have<br>
laughed.  Instead you are now placed in the position of asserting that they<br>
are sober fact.<br>
<p>
Which they aren't.  Three are flawed.  You see, given my enormous talent in<br>
the area of rationalization, I have become *very* good at detecting incorrect<br>
ones.  But can you find the flaws?<br>
<p>
If I gave my explanation of astrology, sober scientists would actually try the<br>
experiment (it would fail, because astrology DOESN'T work), and my explanation<br>
would be enshrined in the hearts of New Agers forever and ever.  It wouldn't<br>
matter what I said.<br>
