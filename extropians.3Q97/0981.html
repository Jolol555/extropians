     The tropical variety of psychedlelic mushroom is very brightly colored <br>
     (red cap with white spots---Alice was quite taken with them).<br>

     Hara Ra pointed out:<br>
     <br>
     I think not. Not as described in McKenna's tapes of his Amazon<br>
     adventures. And Amanita Muscara has NO psilocybin in them, and grows <br>
     under birch and pine trees, not often encountered in the tropics.<br>
     <br>
     I respond:<br>
     <br>
     I'm no botanist.  I've seen pictures (the cover of my psylocibin <br>
     grower's book has one) and I was making a literary connection with <br>
     Lewis Carroll's fanciful tale and the use of psychedelics.<br>
     <br>
     Regarding the use of psylocibin, I have to share an experience I had <br>
     where I began with a THC cookie and then took mushrooms.  I have no <br>
     prolfic interest in mathematics and prefer more audio-visual art <br>
     forms.  I laid in my dark bedroom to trip (it's more reverent and <br>
     you're not distracted by visual sensory stuff--you go deeper).<br>
     <br>
     I hallucinated (eyes closed) an extremely elaborate and intricate <br>
     picture, on the order of something M.C. Escher might have attempted.  <br>
     It was multi-dimensional and incredible to observe.  I thought that it <br>
     would be neat to observe it more up close.  As soon as that "wish" <br>
     occurred, I "zoomed in" on on of the tiniest connecting lines of the <br>
     picture and discovered that it was a veritable "interstate" of <br>
     mathematical equations moving back and forth along the "line".  It was <br>
     incredible.<br>
     <br>
     Coming out of that trip, I had a newfound appreciation for the impact <br>
     of math (particularly geometry) on the advancement of civilization.  I <br>
     can rarely look at anything now without appreciating the lines and <br>
     arcs of its make up.<br>
     <br>
