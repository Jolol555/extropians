In his last published work, _The_Contest_of_the_Faculties_, Kant famously<br>
enthused that there is no sweeter occupation than the planning of state<br>
constitutions.  I expect we will live to see the day when these<br>
foundational documents will be as obsolete as Kant's other occupation,<br>
foundational Philosophy, is in our own day.  I for one expect polity to<br>
disjoin geography to such an extent (this is already happening) that the<br>
traditional role of constitutions as a check on abuses and guarantor of<br>
sociocultural continuities will be better provided by the reflective<br>
equilibrium generated among the arrangements and expectations of<br>
autonomous but cooperating social agencies with which we will contract for<br>
services presently offered willy-nilly by nation-state agencies.  As it<br>
happens, I am deeply fond of the United States Constitution and don't<br>
trust my fellow-citizens *qua* architects to produce a better document,<br>
though I scarcely doubt their ability to junk the present one.  Like most<br>
of my fellow-citizens, I have lots of pet suggestions for tinkering with<br>
the thing, but nothing so sweeping as would deserve the moniker "v2.0". <br>
I'll leave it to ongoing and upcoming exigencies of a technoconstituted<br>
future to bring on changes of that drastic a character...  after all, they<br>
usually do anyway.  Best, Dale<br>
