Its even worse. If we assume that people can act in one of three ways in<br>
an economy of either money or politics: 1) as a producer, 2) as a<br>
consumer, or 3) as a manager of capital, we can see that both the<br>
concept of government and the concept of the corporation are flawed in<br>
practice, biasing "control" to one of the three groups while often<br>
pretending to give it to another or the others.<br>
<p>
Many current liberals decry that the corporations major flaw is that the<br>
workers do not give sufficient input or have control over management,<br>
while proponents of capital say that anyone can have control and input<br>
by buying or earning stock in a corporation that is publicly traded.<br>
Thus capital blames labor when company performance is down, while labor<br>
blames capital when capitals natural risk aversion impedes the<br>
corporations ability to respond to the market. Both groups claim that<br>
the consumers only rightful mode of input or control is via the "market<br>
signals", yet how often is poor corporate performance because either<br>
capital or labor or both ignored the "market signals" that consumers<br>
were trying so desperately to gain the corporations attention with? How<br>
often is the cost of the predatory self interest of capital or labor or <br>
both simply paid for by consumers, either in money or in choice (the<br>
same thing, really), when the consumer's ability to input or make<br>
choices is impeded by capital or labor?<br>
<p>
Government, on the other hand, deals in an economy of power, or freedom.<br>
Capital is represented by whoever is legally the source of power. In<br>
feudal and other authoritarian systems, power trickles down from the<br>
Monarch, while democratic systems purport that power is vested in the<br>
people, and only flows to a greater concentration or potential by the<br>
work and consent of the people, via the sacrosanct "natural law". If,<br>
however, we recognise the real validity of Mao's maxim "Justice comes<br>
from the barrel of a gun", those with control of the guns are the ones<br>
who control the "means of production" or the capital of an economy of<br>
political power. The players are the bureaucracy, the politicians (often<br>
also the aristocracy), and the citizenry. How these correlate to the<br>
consumer/producer/capital manager triad varies under different systems,<br>
and to different degrees.<br>
<p>
For example, nihilists and extreme anarchists are singularly fanatical<br>
about the "noble savage" concept, that the production, consumption, and<br>
management of one's own political capital and product rest solely in the<br>
individual. Libertarians go more for free and voluntary association (or<br>
lack thereof) among rationally self interested Baysians. Communists bias<br>
completely in favor of power being vested in those who represent or<br>
control labor, while Western Democrats are aristocrats who con the<br>
plebes with the "I feel your pain" rap. Conservative Republicans go for<br>
the "If you can't be just like us, its no wonder you're a piece of shit,<br>
but there's no reason why in this great country you can't be just like<br>
us, Gawd Bless Uhmerica, and BTW, you can't eat in here." Democrats know<br>
much better than you how to best spend your money, while Republicans<br>
know much better than you how behave in your own home, and communists<br>
not only know much better than you how to do both, but also how to earn<br>
your money and own your house. Socialists, well they're just communists<br>
who haven't got the guts, or the political capital, to fully act on<br>
their convictions.<br>
<p>
<p>
Any comments? Yeah I know it kind of degenerated, but what the hell....<br>
