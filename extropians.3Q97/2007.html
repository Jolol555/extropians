While I haven't the poetic ability...I would like to commend the poet...and<br>
comment that similar problems occur in my industry as well (trucking).<br>
  Outrageous expectations...little respect for drivers....negligent attitude<br>
regarding the reality of  the situation..."but it's only THAT FAR on the<br>
map!"...<br>
<p>
I couldna said it any better<br>
