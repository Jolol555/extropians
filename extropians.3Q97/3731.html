<i>&gt; On the other hand, I cannot help but</i><br>
<i>&gt; disagree with your assertion that a *desire* to end suffering is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; prerequisite of acting to end it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I see too many counter-examples where actions taken from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; desire to end suffering tend to increase what I see as suffering,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and where actions apparently based on an indifference to suffering</i><br>
<i>&gt; have, as a part-consequence, a reduction in suffering.</i><br>
<p>
Quite true; I could have worded that better.  I still think, though,<br>
that while desire to end suffering is neither a necessary nor sufficient<br>
condition to actually ending it, it /is/ more likely to achieve that<br>
result in rational minds.  Rational minds are persuaded by results, and<br>
if they see their actions increasing suffering, their desire to end<br>
it will encourage them to act differently.  It is unfortunate that<br>
there are also large numbers of irrational minds who create suffering<br>
and refuse to acknowledge that, and keep creating more while protesting<br>
their desire to end it and calling us names when we point to facts.<br>
<p>
I point this out because I don't want to confuse what I am calling<br>
"compassion" with mere benevolence, as Rand used the term.  The former<br>
is a choice I make freely, and that I would not criticize others for<br>
not making; the latter is a moral imperative.<br>
