<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To some extent, sex isn't something subject to a market.  To me, a great part</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the sexual experience is being desired and valued.  Really, I can't buy</i><br>
<i>&gt;that.  Sure I could hire somebody who might even do a good act, but the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;that I would have to pay them would always remain as proof that it's just an</i><br>
<i>&gt;act.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm not amongst the "starving" at present, nor do I anticipate being so in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the foreseeable future.  I do like participating in and reading discussion of</i><br>
<i>&gt;sexual issues as I find that enables me to improve on a good thing; it can</i><br>
<i>&gt;always be better :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Note I'm not proposing to ban such discussions.  I'm just describing a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;reason for my unease.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yet discussing sexual matters is, I think, a good way to improve one's sexual</i><br>
<i>&gt;desirability and confidence.  For those who think they are unattractive, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;helps show that non-physical elements are far more important than the media</i><br>
<i>&gt;lets on, and that the range of "desired" is much broader in real life than in</i><br>
<i>&gt;modeling, acting, and pornography.  For anybody, knowledge of psychology,</i><br>
<i>&gt;goals, and techniques of sex and sexual attraction allow one to make oneself</i><br>
<i>&gt;more desirable, to more precisely target those who would desire you, and to</i><br>
<i>&gt;make oneself more of a value to one's partner(s).</i><br>
<p>
I am in the habit of being circumspect about this for the reasons Robin<br>
describes, yet he and others make a good point that it can be a valuable<br>
thing to discuss. Extropians use subject lines better than most people in<br>
general; I find that on other lists there is an explicit policy of putting<br>
certain topics in the subject line like this: [sexuality], so they are easy<br>
to sort out. I think it might be a good time for me in particular to be<br>
able to winnow the sexuality posts from the other gender posts...I just<br>
mention this as a counter data point, because other posters described<br>
themselves as "not 'starving'", and therefore not needing the kind of<br>
consideration Robin was mentioning.<br>
