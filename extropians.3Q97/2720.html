In a message dated 97-09-01 04:02:15 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; "Blue<br>
 goo" initially sounds like "cold goo", and in this sense "red goo" would<br>
make<br>
 a nice opposite.  The police-protection sense, I think, is confined to<br>
America<br>
 and a few other countries.  (Is it an international symbol?)  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Interesting.  I might mention that while I was on the Isle of Crete a few<br>
years ago I read a book concerning the paintings (murals...fresco?) in King<br>
Minos Palace....It has lots of Blue and depictions of Dolphin...  At first<br>
people (victorian england) considered it a cheerful depiction...later however<br>
it was found that for the Minoans blue was not a happy color...rather it<br>
depicted oncoming death and dolphins were their equivalent of the Grim<br>
Reaper...<br>
<p>
For what it's worth.<br>
