Rick! Death is emancipatory? You have thrown off your shackles and can<br>
run off into the wild, blue yonder? I can't help but think that death is<br>
the final chaining of my personal evolution. I view death as a<br>
challenge. If not overcomeable (though this remains to be seen), then at<br>
the very least an impetus to personal action today -- not now, but right<br>
now. Okay, so you are right in a way. Death is indeed emancipatory -- it<br>
frees you from the obligation to grow more complex. <br>
<p>
My attitude is not a blind middle-finger to the Grim Reaper. More like<br>
an arrogant smirk. ;-)<br>
