Who put you in charge? Since you didn't mention my name specifically, I <br>
cannot assume you were referring to me.  However, if you believe any of <br>
my posts have been lacking in critical thinking, please point them out.  <br>
I agree with you that there is a lack of reasoning among some who make <br>
posts on this list.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
I too enjoy hearing Carl Feynman's posts. And yes, I prefer to hear more <br>
established scientific extroplations on this list. I must say however, <br>
that it is people like you that give me the creeps! As we approach the <br>
singularity, I hope that those ahead will have more tolerance of those <br>
behind, than you do.  Otherwise I fear, we will end up with some nasty <br>
form of nanotechnological ubergoo from the likes of you!<br>
<p>
By the way, its going to take a lot more than elitist posts such as <br>
yours to get me off this list.  In fact, just on principle I feel like <br>
posting all sorts of pseudo-scientific and non-sensical drivel. But <br>
lucky for you I have better manners and will spare you such agony.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
