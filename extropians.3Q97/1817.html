<i>&gt; I'm charmed by the idea that I might now have been reading extropian and</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanist posts long enough to have settled down out of my instinctive</i><br>
<i>&gt; terror of, like, you know, *really scary futuristic ideas*.  I suppose I</i><br>

<i>&gt; about extreme technologies since... well, since Eliezer was minus 17 years</i><br>
<i>&gt; old.</i><br>
<p>
For the record, I didn't know that... and didn't have to.  I did know that<br>
you'd been writing articulate and non-shocked posts for the few months I'd<br>
been here.  Ergo, you either lost the instinctive terror/technophobia or were<br>
perfectly capable of keeping it out of writing... far more likely the former,<br>
given the Laws governing novelty, focus of attention, and emotional reaction. <br>
Anyway, as I said and you admit, you indeed faked the shock:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That biographical detail aside, it's true that I've chosen in this</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-specialist book to adopt something of Ed Regis's faux-shocked tone in</i><br>
<i>&gt; easing into some of these topics.  It's my experience that while this can</i><br>
<i>&gt; grate on us old troupers/troopers, it's just what the doctor ordered for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the many readers (the thousands and millions of them out there) who start</i><br>
<i>&gt; off wanting to know... what kinds of fashions we'll be wearing in 2050.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;shrug&gt;.  Bear in mind that from my perspective, we all occupy a point on that<br>
continuum.  Wanting to know what kinds of bodies we'll be wearing in 2050 -<br>
how we'll eat, how we'll amuse ourselves, how we'll communicate, whether we'll<br>
be exploring the galaxy... from my perspective, there's not much of a<br>
difference between that and asking about fashion styles.<br>
<p>
You don't care about fashion styles because you've been steeped in science<br>
fiction so long that you've caught a glimpse of far stranger things to come. <br>
And I... who've been involuntarily caught up in the Singularity's shadow as<br>
far back as I can remember... what bodies we'll be wearing?  I can't make<br>
myself care.  You may have been "making a living writing about extreme<br>
technologies", but I've been writing about living it.  By any reasonable<br>
standards, I am a character in a science fiction novel.<br>
<p>
In a few years, with luck, most of what I said will be a commonplace of<br>
science fiction, and my "Staring Into The Singularity" will seem quaint and<br>
conservative.  That's what happened to "True Names", after all.  Everything<br>
that gets written about the future seems quaint and conservative eventually. <br>
Is my page going to be the sole exception, the one document that really *was*<br>
Too Far Out?<br>
<p>
What can I say?  I've lost my suspension of disbelief in this mortal Universe.<br>
