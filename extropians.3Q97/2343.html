     <br>
     When listing the USA maybe they were referring to the 3million<br>
     or so unborn children who are executed every year.?.....nawwwwwww..<br>

     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     Me thinks a nerve is thus exposed in our traveling Texan.  "Execution" <br>
     in terms of abortion is a horse of a different color with gobs of <br>
     offshoots that I'm sure have their Extropian angle but you'd have to <br>
     carefully position it so.  Otherwise, it's the same ol' debate.<br>
     <br>
     BTW, for the record, I am anti-abortion *and* pro-choice.  It's weird <br>
     but I've wedged it into my belief system in a way where I'm comfy.  I <br>
     used "acocuntability" as my wrench to tighten it in.  I've already had <br>
     to deal with abortion and it was anything BUT comfy.  I can tell you <br>
     that the sanctity one holds for a gestating human life can be quickly <br>
     comprimised by the threat of someone outside your family carelessly <br>
     destroying the relations of those within it.  To have chosen the life <br>
     of that unborn would've been to have sealed that connection <br>
     biologically or socially...neither of which was acceptable. <br>
     <br>
     The decision to abort a child brings up feelings akin to racism, <br>
     classism, and negative emotions you didn't even know could manifest.  <br>
     It was a purging but growing experience for me as a passive <br>
     participant (the somewhat unwilling support person).  But it is not a <br>
     simple issue and certainly not easily clumped together with the <br>
     execution of capital criminals.<br>
