Speaking of waistlines...I've finally got mine out there where I can keep an<br>
eye on it.<br>
<p>
Seriously though...something's gotta be done...  and I've been thinking about<br>
it for some time...unfortunately thinking doesn't accomplish much...my job is<br>
(mostly) sedantary....and the possible exercise in which I might engage is<br>
insufferably boring....(weight lifting...dumbells)....or dangerous..(walking<br>
after a day of driving...thru warehouse districts...docks....etc....or thru<br>
truckstops...dodging SUPER-TRUCKER!!!  90mph inna parking lot)<br>
<p>
So...I have come up with an alternative...which I would like critiqued.<br>
<p>
I was in the same room with a TV a week or so ago...rare occurence....The Tv<br>
was on to an "infomercial"....one of those (you guessed it) exercise<br>
machines.  This particular one was something called (I think) the Western<br>
Flyer.(it said something about a web-site?)  It was billed as an alternative<br>
to the Health Rider ..."why ride when you can FLY!!"  Naturally all the<br>
models were in wonderful shape ...mostly female...and incredibly sexy.<br>
<p>
But I keep thinking about it. &lt;infectous memes&gt;<br>
<p>
Some time in the not too distant future I'm going to "remodel" my truck.<br>
 Probably put a big horse under the hood and get a custom sleeper. (at that<br>
it'll still cost between a quarter and a half of what a new truck would<br>
cost...$120K or so...for what I'd get).. In that sleeper why not have an<br>
exercise machine?  Some guys do....I've heard of Nordic Tracks and various<br>
weight machines...<br>
<p>
My thought is a variation on that theme....virtual reality.  <br>
<p>
The Western Flyer provides a "full body workout" with a motion not unlike<br>
cross country skiing or skating. (and it folds up relatively small) Now<br>
suppose that various sensors were attached to the machine(duration,speed,etc<br>
equivalents.) ...and the user..(heart rate..blood pressure)..and fed to a<br>
computer which controls a VR setup...taking appropriate scenes from a CD-rom<br>
no doubt....or developed according to some program.  The user would ...via<br>
head-mounted display and audio...experience something similar to roller<br>
blading or skiing....or whatever...variable scenery...controll of direction<br>
and speed...maybe even some kind of game or competition &lt;roller blade thru<br>
the valley of EEEE Gog....look out for trolls, dragons...and naked water<br>
sprites....be sure you laser bolt ...and other weapons..are fully charged!&gt;<br>
<p>
At least it would releive the deadly boredom of monotonous...repetitive<br>
exercise...and if it's fun...it won't be a chore to do it often enough to be<br>
useful.<br>
<p>
The exercise machine in question costs about $200...i-glasses cost about<br>
$500...that leaves a computer...would a general purpose one work...like my<br>
pentium laptop?  or would it need a dedicated chip...and the engineering...or<br>
is plug-in play (with a few mods) possible? and the programming....(I<br>
particularly like the part about chasing the scantily-clad nympth down the<br>
long winding grassy lane thru the forest.......&lt;computer monitors<br>
heartbeat...once "training effect " is acheived and maintained for given<br>
period of time..."trainee" gets a reward......gains on nympth<br>
or...!!!!!!!!!!&gt;<br>
