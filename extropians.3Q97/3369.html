<i>&gt;  &gt; I have perused the extro list for over 2 years now, and I have yet</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt; to hear any reasonable talk about compassion or building livingry</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt; for the majority o humanity that is becoming increasingly unnecessary</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt; in the free-market.</i><br>

 There are always some people who equate free market libertarian politics<br>
with a "I got mine" mentality, and there are a few of those rampant types<br>
about. Hey, listen most of us are much more intersted in finding a new<br>
paradigm that solves the problem, not ignores it.  Sanctioning victim<br>
mentality is not going to solve a thing. It hasn't in the past and it isn't<br>
likely to in the future.<br>
<p>
You yourself stated that you didnt have a solution. Asking questions is much<br>
more productive than brandishing insults. Obviously you read this for a<br>
reason. Maybe there is value in this philosophy for you.  I value compassion,<br>
some do not. A small percentage of people actually think it is EVIL... most<br>
have an understanding of when it is appropriate and when it is damaging.<br>
