Neanderthals lived from 300,000 to 30,000 years ago, fully modern humans came <br>
along about 120,00 years ago, so they coexisted for about 90 thousand years. <br>
Neanderthals had brains at least as large as modern humans and they made <br>
tools almost as sophisticated, the main difference in culture was that Humans<br>
produced Art and Neanderthals did not. That's probably significant but I <br>
confess I don't quite know what to make of it.<br>
<p>
One of the great mysteries was whether there was any interbreeding between <br>
these two groups, it looks like the question has been settled. In today's <br>
issue of Cell Dr. Svante Paabo of the University of Munich reports that he<br>
has discovered mitochondrial DNA in a Neanderthal bone and found no evidence<br>
of any interbreeding with modern humans, no Neanderthals genes in the Human <br>
gene pool.  He also found that the 2 groups were not as closely related as <br>
thought, the last common ancestor to Humans and Neanderthals lived between <br>
550 and 690 thousand years ago.<br>
<p>
I have a hunch that this may have something to say about Robin Hanson's great <br>
filter, but again I'm not quite sure what. On the one hand a big brain was <br>
produced in 2 independent ways, on the other hand one of those ways did not <br>
work out in the long term.<br>
<p>
Speaking of Robin Hanson, I want to congratulate him on his new Ph.D., not  <br>
that I'm surprised, I already knew he was smart as hell.<br>
                                                  <br>
