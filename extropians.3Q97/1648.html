     Hagbard Celine posed:<br>
     <br>
     "What changes in your personal lifestyle have you taken to increase <br>
     the amount of extropy therein (mental, physical, social, etc.)? Or if <br>
     not changes, per se, what have you always been doing to effect the <br>
     same end?"<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight adds:<br>
     <br>
     I too have been wondering about that particularly in the relationship <br>
     between the quest for physical life extension through cryonics and <br>
     uploading which are, albeit gaining some measure of scientific <br>
     consideration, still rather lofty notions.  However, there is the more <br>
     concrete and pragmatic pursuit of nutrition.  I'm wondering about how <br>
     many extropians filter their water, pursue either vegetarian diets or <br>
     thoughtfully chosen carnivorous diets (i.e., small quantities from <br>
     reliable sources, not regular mindless grabbing of the package of <br>
     Foster Farms chicken at Safeway.) How many supplement their diets with <br>
     a designed mineral and vitamin regimen?  How many wear sun block or <br>
     otherwise fortify their skin to help it maintain it's younger appeal. <br>
     How many smoke, drink substantial amounts of alcohol, eat a majority <br>
     of refined foods.  <br>
     <br>
     Why the questions?  To me, there is a relationship between the pitch <br>
     and the substance.  The walk and the talk.  I look for it everywhere <br>
     (including in myself).  Not expecting perfection, just ongoing <br>
     awareness and a concerted effort.  <br>
     <br>
     Just how sacred is the Extropian body in these days where we can only <br>
     extend part scientific confidence and part good ol' faith in the life <br>
     extension capabilities fashioned for immortality?<br>
