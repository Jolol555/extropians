Nobody denies that they lie. But they don't *always* lie, and not<br>
*everything* they say is intended to fool you. That makes it harder.<br>
One should not trust them, but listening to them might sometimes be<br>
useful (especially by discovering what they are not telling). <br>

that &gt; papers are submitted to the above mentioned Journals....and<br>

<p>
Well, the review process is rather cumbersome for everyone and most<br>
papers are rejected at the first (and second, and tenth...)  attempt<br>
to get them published. Scientists just have to go on submitting them,<br>
trying to find a journal with sympathetic reviewers (or bad quality<br>
:-( ).  There are issues which tend to get rejected more easily than<br>
others, that is unfortunately true, but it would be amazing if a well<br>
researched if controversial experiment couldn't get published<br>
*anywhere*. Remember that even the infamous and subsequently debunked<br>
"water memory" paper was published in Nature.<br>
<p>
The scientific process is tricky and occasionally irritatingly<br>
conservative, but there is no need for evil conspiracies suppressing<br>
ideas (they have so little to gain). <br>
<p>
Apropos pseudoscience, I got an email today which quite well<br>
illustrates the typical way pesudoscientists concentrate on how<br>
oppressed they are instead of finding evidence for their views; it is<br>
somewhat morbid, but quite revealing (I have no idea of if Marinov<br>
actually did useful research, and do not make any claims about it,<br>
it is the rhetoric which is so typical):<br>

Subject: Stefan Marinov 'successful'<br>
<p>
World-friend,<br>
<p>
I received word today, from Francisco Muller, that Stefan Marinov -- to<br>
my regret -- successfully suicided this week.<br>
<p>
I never met Marinov, but had read of his previous self-immolation<br>
threats or attempts.  All for the purpose of bringing the truth to<br>
light; of the covert nature of world physics, and the truth of free<br>
'energy', aenertia or aether.<br>
<p>
Isn't it time we wiped the slate clean -- of the ruling mindset of<br>
deliberate lies, conformist media, selfish misdirection and criminal<br>
destruction?<br>
<p>
We have precious little time,<br>
