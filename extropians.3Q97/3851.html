     Look, Rick, I'm willing to try to understand your language;<br>
     I'm willing to try to explain when my language leaves you<br>
     scratching your head -- but I'm not going to abandon my kind<br>
     of clarity for a clumsy imitation of your kind of warmth.<br>
     Don't assume, because of that, that I am ignorant of ethics.<br>
     <br>
     But if I do lack compassion, well - tough shit.  I'm not<br>
     going to acquire it just because you tell me I ought to.<br>
     Does that mean we can't work together?<br>
     <br>

     <br>
     Well, let's see.  I'd need to know what action is behind "willing to <br>
     try to understand my language" given the rather adamant "won'ts" you <br>
     further decree in your statement.<br>
     <br>
     I tend to synergize most intimately with those more on my wavelength <br>
     but I can learn from those who aren't.  The appearance of impatience <br>
     and intolerance have a high charge for me.  For instance, what does <br>
     "tough shit" mean to someone with whom you are attempting to establish <br>
     cooperation and combine talents/efforts?  <br>
     <br>
     I would say that we could likely contribute different perspectives to <br>
     a joint effort but not on any intimate scale (in other words, there's <br>
     a likelihood that the personality clash would get in the way of the <br>
     work).  Still, there is something very valuable for the individual in <br>
     the discipline of putting ones preferences/expectations aside for the <br>
     greater good/ultimate goal.<br>
