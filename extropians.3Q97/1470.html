Do you get the same result if you only send one photon through one slot?  Or<br>
do you have to send two photons through both the slots at different times?<br>
 Also, surely there are more than two probabilities (the two slots) there are<br>
near-infinite probabilities (going through the slot at different angles,<br>
hitting the thing with the slots in, going in the opposite direction...).<br>
 All of these seem just as likely as the photon going through one slot or the<br>
other.  So then, we only get new worlds from possibilities we measure.  But<br>
to measure our photon in this world surely the photon must be in this world<br>
(or can photons and electrons pass between worlds?).  If I happen to move a<br>
piece of film in the way of one of the many (possibly infinite) paths of the<br>
photon I'll measure it and therefore create a new universe.  Now with all<br>
these phantom photons floating about, sooner or later a large majority of<br>
them are going to get measured in some way (Which could lead you to the<br>
conclusion that a single photon radiates in a sphere but is only detectable<br>
by measurement).  We whould be getting a  rate of millions of worlds per<br>
photon (anyone want to estimate the amount of photons, the amount of<br>
directions each could move in and how likely they are to be measured given<br>
the size of space and the number of possible measuring devices within it?).<br>
