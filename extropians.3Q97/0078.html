                   <br>
<p>
True, and a bunch of neurons and the strength of their interconnections is <br>
not identical or even similar to 700 nm light either.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If my brain used a different color quale to represent the text it         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;would be a different experience, though the behavior and          </i><br>
<i>        &gt;understanding about the contents of the text may be the same.</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
If your subjective experience was different but your behavior was the same <br>
then consciousness would be useless as far as Evolution was concerned and <br>
would have never bothered to produce it. To my mind this is one of the <br>
strongest indications that you're wrong about behavior being unrelated to <br>
consciousness.<br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;some aspects of my brain are not important, like its  color or taste         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;or the sound it would make when dropped from a 5  story building.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Abstractly or behaviorally speaking, yes.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Agreed, except I still don't understand the A word.             <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;But if you are interested in the precise subjective experience and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;what it is really consciously like, the particular qualia used, and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;what it is like, does make a difference.</i><br>
        <br>
<p>
When you drink a cup of coffee not only do some of these silly irrelevant <br>
qualities chance but your behavior does too. Are you the same person after  <br>
you drink a cup of coffee?<br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>      &gt;Abstraction and independence of the particular physical representation       </i><br>
<i>      &gt;are very powerful computational and modeling notions. But this has       </i><br>
<i>      &gt;become one of the issues that is blinding us from being  able to       </i><br>
<i>      &gt;discover precisely what consciousness is and what it is made of.       </i><br>
<i>      &gt;It is blinding us to the important issue of what consciousness is      </i><br>
<i>      &gt;fundamentally like, as opposed to what it merely represents.</i><br>
        <br>
<p>
You want to understand the mind but you don't want to use  behavior and now <br>
you don't want to use the only thing that can explain it, information theory.  <br>
I wish you good luck, you'll need it.<br>
        <br>

<i>        &gt;red is not physically anything like 700 nm wavelength </i><br>
<i>        &gt;electromagnetic radiation.  </i><br>
       <br>
Agreed.<br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;It only abstractly represents it.          </i><br>
        <br>
There's that A word again.<br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;But then 700 nm light, or an abstract 32 bit number stored in an         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;array of transistors, isn't anything like red either.</i><br>
        <br>
Slice open a brain and look at it, not only will you not find any 700 nm <br>
light in it you will not find red either, it's gray. Open up a racing car, <br>
you will not find speed inside. I think you're confusing levels.<br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Phenomenal joys have intrinsic value.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The only thing that has intrinsic value is consciousness, by that I mean the <br>
thing itself thinks it is valuable. If something is not conscious then it <br>
doesn't think so it has no intrinsic value, although of course it could have <br>
extrinsic value. Anyway, that's what I think.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Actually experiencing a stunning sunrise has much more value than         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;just abstractly reading about it or representing such in an abstract         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;virtual reality computer.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's because with our current technology the real sunset is much more <br>
information rich than any produced in a computer. I see no reason why the <br>
reverse couldn't be true someday<br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;If I discovered a new color then my understanding of red would        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;change too, into something much richer.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I simply don't agree with you here.  Red is and always will be red</i><br>
                       <br>
<p>
Looking at an object made of a new color against a red background would give <br>
meaning to both colors they didn't have before.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Just like gold will always be gold and always has been gold no        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;matter how many more elements we have and will discover </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's because an element does not derive its meaning from the presence or  <br>
absence of another element, color is different. Without contrast color is <br>
meaningless.<br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;that real moon up in the sky and beyond your senses is not         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;fundamentally like your subjective and phenomenal representation of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that moon that is produced by your optic neurons          </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
Again, I agree but I don't see the relevance. Neither I nor an upload would  <br>
have an understanding of what deep reality is all about. So what? Appearances <br>
are  what's important, ultimate reality is for philosophers.  As long as I <br>
can get the universe to SEEM to obey me and operate in a way that pleases me, <br>
that's good enough and I'll be a happy man. That's not asking too much, <br>
now is it?<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;if you  reject that [behavior] you have nothing left.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;No, we have much more than that.  All I must do is reproduce the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;same sensations in your consciousness in order for me to "eff" them. </i><br>
           <br>
<p>
You may indeed be able to find the correct theory of consciousness, but there <br>
is no way you could ever know it was correct or in any way better than the <br>
other infinite number of consciousness theories. Maybe you do taste salt just <br>
like I do, but there is no way to know it for sure.<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I will say: "Feel this, this is what salt tastes like to me."</i><br>
           <br>
<p>
And I will say I don't believe you. How do you know that the sensation I'm <br>
feeling is anything like the one you are, and if you reject behavior,  how do <br>
you know I'm feeling anything at all?<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Since your understanding of the physics will be so thorough and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;reproducible in your own mind, you will know that there is no other         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;possibility but that that is how salt tastes for me.</i><br>
           <br>
<p>
If you come up with a new theory of Physics the only way to test it is by <br>
observation. Actually  that's not just true of physics but of all Science. <br>
If you come up with a new theory of consciousness there is no observation to <br>
test it on, there are no facts it must explain, that's why you could crank out <br>
an infinite number of such theories with no way of knowing which one is <br>
correct.<br>
<p>
Science should investigate consciousness, and Science means observation. <br>
I read  Crick's book, I agree completely with him, and he realizes he will <br>
get nowhere without studying behavior. It's difficult enough as it is,  <br>
why throw away your only tool?<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;When we thoroughly understand the physics involved and objectively         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;watch the neural corelate in our own brain and see how they precisely         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;map to and predict the feelings we feel</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You can't use your consciousness theory because that's what you're trying to <br>
test and the only feeling I can objectively observe is my own, so how could I <br>
ever objectively prove you're conscious? This doesn't bother me much because <br>
I take it as an axiom of existence that intelligent behavior means <br>
consciousness.<br>
           <br>
<i>        &gt;my theory or prediction is, that there are some fundamental physical        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;phenomenon that each of our brains use, possibly in subtly and even        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;occasionally grossly different ways</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree, I don't believe in the soul, I think consciousness is indeed a <br>
physical phenomenon. However, you can never learn anything about any physical <br>
phenomena unless you observe the way it behaves. I am also convinced that if <br>
you ignore information theory and assume that the value of a bit depends on <br>
the way it is stored you're taking a huge step backward into the 19'th <br>
century.                                    <br>
