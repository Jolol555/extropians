: I've done little legislative history concerning the 2nd, but an educated<br>
: guess would be that to get it ratified, the delegates made both of those<br>
: arguments, and more. Hunting for meat and/or the skins trade was pretty<br>
: important both economically and also for an individual's livelihood.<br>
<p>
(there's a difference?)<br>
<p>
:  And self-defense has always been offered as a valid reason for weapons<br>
: proliferation. Unfortunately, the Congress was secret and the only notes<br>
: made were Madison's and Jefferson's (?) so we have a tough time knowing<br>
: what they were really trying to do.<br>
<p>
The Convention of 1787 was secret (and Madison took notes).<br>
This is the first I've heard that the First Congress of 1789,<br>
in which the Bill of Rights was drafted, was also secret.<br>
<p>
Article One, Section Five, third paragraph:<br>
	Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from<br>
	time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in<br>
	their Judgement require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the<br>
	Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of<br>
	one fifth of the present, be entered on the Journal.<br>
<p>
Is it recorded why the drafting of the Bill of Rights was so sensitive?<br>
