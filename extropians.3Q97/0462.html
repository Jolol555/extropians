Sure.  In any signaling process, a variety of types of people are<br>
pooled together with each possible signal.  The signal reciever can at<br>
best only respond to a signaler based on some average type of senders<br>
of such signals.  So the type of an individual who differs from that<br>
average is not fully revealed.  See standard signaling game lit.<br>

<p>
Responding to a post like yours with a quick comment like this can<br>
also be a way to cozy up to the poster.  Of course it helps to say<br>
something like "Oh yes I agree", even if you wouldn't otherwise want<br>
to believe something that strong. :-)<br>

<i>&gt;Robin, I can't help think your analysis is wrong to omit some analysis of</i><br>
<i>&gt;communication and interaction in its discussion of belief (and, indeed, of</i><br>
<i>&gt;clothes.) Without the communication of your belief to another through some</i><br>
<i>&gt;form of interaction, vocal or otherwise, it does not serve a social</i><br>
<i>&gt;purpose. Moreover, since this interaction is a choice, it is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;manifestation of the functionality of the belief system, within your model.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The dichotomy between functional and social roles of belief is therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt;blurred: one function of belief is social differentiation.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that the social role of beliefs is also in a sense<br>
"functional", which is why I put this word in quotes in my first<br>
usage.  Perhaps it would have been better to say "social" vs. "non-social"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Beliefs about small military missions or small engineering</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;projects come to mind.  ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That assumes that the social role is less important than the functional</i><br>
<i>&gt;role merely because of the size of the 'society' involved.  ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps the key here is your phrase 'with little social monitoring':</i><br>
<p>
I guess I meant "small" not just in terms of total number of people<br>
involved, but also in terms of its relative importance in your social<br>
life.  But I hadn't thought it through very well, I agree.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If your implication is that the wearing of bikinis would allow the</i><br>
<i>&gt;people of the Artic to fulfil a further social role, then I think it</i><br>
<i>&gt;is based on very Claifornia-centric cultural beliefs: attraction is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;very culturally-relative thing, and I'm sure the people of the Artic</i><br>
<i>&gt;have there own 'bikini-substitute'.</i><br>
<p>
I must be showing my Califonia bias, but I can't help but believe that<br>
Arctic bikini-substitues just aren't as good.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Consciously it is very easy to say one thing and believe another; in ones</i><br>
<i>&gt;everyday actions and interactions it may be more difficult. But does that</i><br>
<i>&gt;mean that the functional and social roles of beliefs conflict? I don't see</i><br>
<i>&gt;why that should follow. As I argue above, the social role of belief is one</i><br>
<i>&gt;of its non-reflexive functions. Furthermore, whilst belief may drive social</i><br>
<i>&gt;interaction, so may social interaction drive belief; Saul becomes Paul on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the road to Damascus. If one has a belief and acts upon it, where is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;conflict? If one wishes to act in a certain way but is prevented from doing</i><br>
<i>&gt;so by ones own belief system then one has a choice to make between amending</i><br>
<i>&gt;ones belief system or not acting in that way. But that is a choice to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;made, and, more likely than not, is one which will be made within the</i><br>
<i>&gt;context of the pre-existing belief system: belief system therefore informs</i><br>
<i>&gt;social action, and vice-versa. There is a dialogue between the two, not a</i><br>
<i>&gt;conflict.</i><br>
<p>
I'm afraid you've completely lost me here.  I was making an analogy to<br>
clothes, where one might have to trade off functionality, such as<br>
tennis shoes might provide, with social roles such as fashion, such as<br>
high heels might provide.  There can be similar tradeoffs in choosing beliefs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;espcially the academically-neglected social role of beliefs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is an area in which that are huge amounts of anthropological</i><br>
<i>&gt;literature available. Indeed, given the nature of ethnographic study, one</i><br>
<i>&gt;is almost forced to construct any paper on the basis of social role.</i><br>
<p>
I was referring primarily to the academic disciplines I am most<br>
familiar with: philosophy, economics, and political science.  I am<br>
aware of some anthro/ethno stuff, and want to read more.  But what<br>
I've seen of that literature seems to suffer rather weak and poorly<br>
considered analysis of the nature of beliefs.  The usual story really:<br>
theorists neglect data and empiricists neglect theory.<br>
