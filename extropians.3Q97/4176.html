<p>
Sorry, Anders, I like Invisible Meta-Hand better. :-) <br>

Accepting Kauffman. . . <br>
<p>
X &lt;--- Y ---&gt; Z<br>
<p>
This is the current state of affairs (by the Sandberg Invisible<br>
Meta-Hand Theory of Political Economy):<br>
<p>
     X is the free market.<br>
     Y is the locus of maximal policy fitness (in the U.S. system --<br>
maximal economic growth).<br>
     Z is central economic planning.<br>
<p>

<p>
The problem, as you've lucidly framed it, is choosing a new X and a new<br>
Z such that Y's maximization of policy fitness yields a corresponding<br>
maximization of human happiness.<br>
<p>
Now we find ourselves deep in modernist political thought. You left open<br>
the possibility that maximal economic growth may indeed be the same as<br>
maximal human happiness.<br>
<p>
Let's juxtapose a couple of quotations from people who are not list<br>
members:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; . . . it is not without reason that [man] seeks out and is willing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; join in society with others who are already united, or have a mind to </i><br>
<i>&gt; unite for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties and estates,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which I call by the general name- property. </i><br>
<p>
--John Locke: The Second Treatise on Government, ch 9.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, </i><br>
<i>&gt; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, </i><br>
<i>&gt; that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.</i><br>
<p>
--Thomas Jefferson: The U.S. Declaration of Independence, July 4,<br>
1776.     <br>
<p>
<p>
Notice how the three most important things to Locke are life, liberty,<br>
and property. Notice how Jefferson borrows the phrase but changes it<br>
into "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." This is pretty<br>
telling commentary on how modern capitalist political economy is<br>
justified. That is, one of the core documents in the democratic<br>
capitalist tradition equates property with happiness.<br>
<p>
So in maximizing economic growth some apparently believe the system<br>
maximizes human happiness. Is this flawed in some way? Yes, to a certain<br>
degree since abundant wealth only allows one more time and resources to<br>
*pursue* happiness. This doesn't mean one will find it. Moreover, in<br>
balancing the free market/government tension, the same system often<br>
allows regulation of certain drugs that have the capacity to make people<br>
happy right at the source, their biological substrate.<br>
<p>
Questions: <br>
<p>
Can there be a direct link between people and happiness, or is some kind<br>
of interposing simplestraction (Yudkowsky, 1997) necessary to make the<br>
link?<br>
<p>
Will there come a point in time when owning property becomes obsolete<br>
and there is not even a perceived link between wealth and happiness?<br>
<p>
Is there one thing that will make everyone happy, and if so, how do we<br>
maximize it? <br>
<p>
<p>
Regards,<br>
