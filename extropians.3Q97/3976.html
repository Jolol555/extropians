   Evolution is not kind to the elderly.  Evolution encourages as many<br>
generations as possible and the most offspring as practical.  Evolution<br>
favors traits that improve the chance of the young growing to reproductive<br>
age at the expense of early death after replication has been successful.<br>
Our cells contain instructions which limit the speed of division more and<br>
more with passing years.  Anytime cells divide there is a chance of<br>
cancer, which can eliminate the young and fertile just as well as the<br>
aged.  Curiously enough, sharks don't get cancer, and they don't die of<br>
natural causes.   For all we know there could be thousand year old sharks<br>
swimming around in the Atlantic.  If we could genetically engineer humans<br>
to not get cancer and then released them in a pastoral world, eventually<br>
they would likely evolve to have greatly increased lifespans, since there<br>
would no longer be any evolutionary pressure against the maintanence<br>
functions which would eliminate aging.  Aging really isn't a flaw, it is<br>
just that genes don't have the same motives as single organisms do.  It is<br>
similar to the way that my body as a whole will set immune system<br>
defenses off to kill a precancerous cell, even though that cell is a part<br>
of me and "wants" to keep living and dividing.  <br>
