response to what he said to me.<br>

Since others of you will no doubt come across Ian Cruikshank, I'm going to<br>
paste in bits of some of his letters. Since he continued to send me abuse<br>
after I asked him to cease communicating, I have no compunction about<br>
posting this drivel publically:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To: coward &lt;MAXMORE@primenet.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So, I suppose you have fatedly been required to ignore me, and sit seething</i><br>
<i>&gt;by your selfish, egotistical lonesome. Have enough ideas in your head to</i><br>
<i>&gt;respond, for a change? p u s s y</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Fuck you, eternally, you intolerant, stubborn, decadent, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;utterly dogmatic capitalist bigot. You have demonstrated in</i><br>
<i>&gt;numerous insults and attacks just how STUCK you are in your</i><br>
<i>&gt;current views, how dogmatically your closed mind rejects new</i><br>
<i>&gt;ideas and information, how utterly selfish and thereby stupid</i><br>
<i>&gt;and non-holistic, doomed to fail, your ideas are.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Might I congratulate you on the excellent manner in which you have</i><br>
<i>&gt;integrated your Extropian Principles into your own life? I mean,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you have just exceeded all expectations of mine, in terms of your</i><br>
<i>&gt;self-transformation and adaption... You communicate so freely and</i><br>
<i>&gt;spontaneously, I just WISH I could be so smooth as you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;NOT!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-iAN cRUIKSHANK</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;P.S. While you're looking me up, look up my buddy Jim Legg,</i><br>
<i>&gt;who helped construct my homepages. You might remember him</i><br>
<i>&gt;from the Extropy Mailing list--you know, the guy you tried</i><br>
<i>&gt;to tamper with his messages, masquerade as him and make him</i><br>
<i>&gt;look bad, destroy his threads, and slowly, systematically</i><br>
<i>&gt;DELETE his posts from your self-centered Extropy mailing</i><br>
<i>&gt;list? Your own behavior and the actions of those you call</i><br>
<i>&gt;your friends is what will bring you and your mission down.</i><br>
<i>&gt;We are keeping track of it all. Just look at Jim's bookmarks</i><br>
<i>&gt;page and you'll see the evidence arranged for all to see.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your actions and attitutes are self-defeating and eventually</i><br>
<i>&gt;self-destructive. We'll be waiting. Count on it, Min Less.</i><br>
<p>
["Min Less"?! How old is this fellow? I did contact Jim. He turned out to<br>
be reasonable and disapproving of Cruikshank's tactics. In discussion with<br>
him it turned out that he recognized that he was in error and that his<br>
posts had *not* been tampered with. Cruikshank's comments were<br>
irresponsible slander.]<br>
<p>
Just to show that he doesn't reserve all his nastiness for me:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now, without any further ado, just listen to the extropians discuss this </i><br>
<i>&gt;topic, in their own inimitable scuzzy manner. The following passages come</i><br>
from <br>
<i>&gt;"If Uploads Come First: The Crack of a Future Dawn", by Robin Hanson.</i><br>
