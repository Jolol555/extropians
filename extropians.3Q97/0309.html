<i>&gt; &gt;Let's not pretend that the enemies of "ideology" don't mean</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;what they say; they do, and should be held accountable for their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;beliefs.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, I'm not sure what you mean by 'what they say', and your use of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the term 'enemy' seems to cast anyone who does not agree with you as </i><br>
<i>&gt; someone who is somehow against you personally.  I think that this </i><br>
<i>&gt; approach to dialogue or debate is one of the facets of ideology that </i><br>
<i>&gt; drove me away from those particular systems of thought--I might relate </i><br>
<i>&gt; to the actual system, but I don't find the conflict created by </i><br>
<i>&gt; statements such as the above productive to the kinds of exploration I </i><br>
<i>&gt; favor.</i><br>
<p>
The first personalization in this discussion was yours above, not mine.<br>
I have said many times, loudly, that I don't and never will give a damn<br>
about the personalities involved in a rational discussion, and my<br>
record on that is very clear.  I am responding to the words printed,<br>
and only those.  I merely suggest that when someone says he is opposed<br>
to ideology, that we ought to believe that he is opposed to ideology,<br>
not that we misunderstand him.  To me, that very statement itself is<br>
evidence that I am attacking the words, not the man.<br>
<p>
The word "enemy" is simply the word that fits the structure of the<br>
sentence I chose, and it means precisely what the dictionary says it<br>
means, not what you might psychologize about my motives.  Personally,<br>
I value quite highly those who disagree with me--especially those<br>
capable of doing so with rational argument.<br>
