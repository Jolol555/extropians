I found Flynn's papers at the library, and they are quite interesting.<br>
"The Mean IQ of Americans: Massive Gains 1932 to 1978", Psychological<br>
Bulletin 1984, Vol. 95, No. 1, 29-51.  Abstract:<br>
<p>
"This study shows that every Stanford-Binet and Wechsler standardization<br>
sample from 1932 to 1978 established norms of a higher standard than its<br>
predecessor.  The obvious interpretation of this pattern is that<br>
representative samples of Americans did better and better on IQ tests<br>
over a period of 46 years, the total gain amounting to a rise in mean IQ<br>
of 13.8 points.  The implications of this finding are developed:  The<br>
combination of IQ gains and the decline in Scholastic Aptitude Test<br>
scores seems almost inexplicable; obsolete norms have acted as an<br>
unrecognized confounding variable in hundreds of studies; and IQ gains of<br>
this magnitude pose a serious problem of causal explanation."<br>
<p>
By the time of a later paper he has an explanation of a sort.<br>
"Massive IQ Gains in 14 Nations: What IQ Tests Really Measure",<br>
Psychological Bulletin 1987, Vol. 101, No. 2, 171-191.  From page 187:<br>
<p>
"The literature makes clear what real-world behavior we have a right to<br>
expect from those at various high IQ levels:  Above 130 they find<br>
school easy and can succeed in virtually any occupation; above 140<br>
their adult achievements are so clear that they fill the pages of<br>
American Men of Science and Who's Who; above 150 they begin to<br>
duplicate the life histories of the famous geniuses who have made<br>
creative contributions to our civilization."   Flynn then goes on to<br>
estimate that the percentage of the Dutch population who would have<br>
scored at 150 or above in 1952 was .04%, but if people today took those<br>
same tests the percentage who would achieve that score would be 2.27%,<br>
an increase by a factor of almost 60, "which means that the Netherlands<br>
alone has over 300,000 people who qualify as potential geniuses.  The<br>
result should be a cultural renaissance too great to be overlooked."<br>
<p>
Flynn then commisioned a study of a variety of European newspapers and<br>
magazines to see if there had been any reports about a dramatic<br>
increase in genius and mathematical and scientific discovery, but there<br>
were none.  (This surprises me, because comments about the<br>
ever-increasing pace of science and human knowledge are something of a<br>
cliche, but perhaps this is never expressed in terms of increased<br>
quality of scientists, rather a matter of quantity.)<br>
<p>
"The only hypothesis that can cover the facts is that the Ravens test<br>
does not measure intelligence but rather a correlate with a weak causal<br>
link to intelligence....  The Ravens test measures a correlate of<br>
intelligence that ranks people sensibly for both 1952 and 1982, but whose<br>
causal link is too weak to rank generations over time."  Flynn proposes<br>
therefore that such tests do not measure intelligence but what he calls<br>
for lack of a better term "abstract problem-solving ability (APSA)".<br>
<p>
He goes on to explain the fall in SAT scores in the face of increases in<br>
abstract IQ test scores as an indication that SAT tests do not measure<br>
APSA.  Rather, they rely more heavily on concrete knowledge at a high<br>
school level.  APSA may be helpful in some parts of the test but<br>
deterioration in the quality of education is a larger effect.<br>
<p>
<p>
I have not yet read these papers in detail, but I don't find Flynn's<br>
arguments completely convincing.  It's not clear that he is justified in<br>
taking his Netherlands data and concluding that 2% of people today would<br>
score at 150 on a 1950's IQ test.  The data from 1950 were not that<br>
complete and he had to put a few different studies together to estimate<br>
the distribution.  Also, by 1982 enough people were getting close to a<br>
perfect score that the distribution was becoming non-normal and that had<br>
to be corrected for as well.<br>
<p>
As for the claim that we should notice if we were living in a society<br>
full of people who would have been considered geniuses in the past,<br>
that's not so clear.  Maybe it is partially a matter of competition -<br>
success in life is not so much a matter of how smart you are, but of<br>
how much smarter you are than everyone else.  And as I mentioned above,<br>
actually it does seem like progress in some areas has accelerated.<br>
Maybe people have moved into fields where individual achievement is<br>
less obvious.  Thousands of anonymous programmers and chemists toil<br>
away in industrial settings for good salaries rather than writing<br>
papers and becoming famous.  There are just so many cultural variables<br>
that I would hesitate to rule out the possibility that people really<br>
are more intelligent on average today.  Checking the newspapers hardly<br>
seems like the right way to answer the question.<br>
