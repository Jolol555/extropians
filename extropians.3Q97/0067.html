	For terminology, I find I prefer "transference" to "uploading"<br>
to denote that ultimate self-upgrading by extending our consciousness<br>
onto/into a computer, a radically different substrate than our own<br>
aging-susceptible human bodies.<br>
<p>
	What I want is not just a facsimile program of my self running<br>
in a computer.  As far as I'm concerned, that would not be<br>
immortality.  What I want is the essentials of my selfhood, whatever I<br>
experience that to be -- not just "copied" or "uploaded" -- but<br>
*transferred* inside a machine -- and literally shuffle off this<br>
mortal coil of my human body.  I believe most Extropians want this as<br>
well, or at least find it to be a very intruiging prospect.<br>
<p>
	I grant that anybody who knows about computers can grasp the<br>
concept of "uploading," but it's still a misleading term, because<br>
transference is more daunting than either the problem of AI (your<br>
transferred self will be an AI; we had better know how to run such<br>
programs) or uploading (transmitting a digital copy of yourself to a<br>
computer; we would need to understand the brain) -- both of which are<br>
necessary *but not sufficient* to effect transference, which much<br>
include a sense of continuity of self.<br>
<p>
	Also, I find I prefer transference's connotations.  Uploading<br>
has computer geeky, science-fictiony connotations.  Transference<br>
connotes better with a "philosophy of transhumanism."<br>
<p>
	What do other list members think?<br>
