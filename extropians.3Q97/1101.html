<p>
Pre-rant:  Of course humans can't "effect" "what is going on" -- there's<br>
too much of it, and it's already going on!  Maybe when we can make our<br>
own pocket universes, or live in virtual realities, we can "effect" what<br>
goes on in them.  However, we _can_ "affect" what is going on now, or<br>
"have an effect on" it.  Look them up.  (Grammatical/semantic pre-rant<br>
complete -- we now return you to our regularly scheduled discussion.)<br>
<p>
Fear.<br>
<p>
Fear of the unknown.  Fear of failure and fear of success (both are forms<br>
of fear of not living up to expectations, the first now and the second in<br>
the future).  Fear of rejection.  Fear of ridicule.  Fear of pain.  Fear<br>
of loss.  Fear of abandonment.  Fear of attack.  Fear of change.<br>
<p>
I think fear helped keep our ancestors alive thousands and millions of<br>
years ago, but I think that its survival value has diminished greatly given<br>
how small the chances are that any given thing will kill us.  As a matter<br>
of fact, when I feel a twinge of fear at (say) talking to a crowd, I say to<br>
myself "You know, all they can do is hiss and boo -- they're not allowed to<br>
gun me down.".  That helps me -- your mileage may vary.<br>
<p>
Hopelessness.<br>
<p>
A feeling that there's nothing they can do about all the wrongs that are<br>
going on in the world (death, taxes, hunger, violence, corruption, etc.).<br>
This is often compounded with guilt -- a sense that they _should_ do<br>
something.<br>
<p>
I may think more about this today, but I have to go to work.  Ciao.<br>
<p>
Join the fight against death and taxes!,<br>
