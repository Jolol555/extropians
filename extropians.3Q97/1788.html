     We used to be a partnership society, before we got corrupted (the fall <br>
     of Adam and Eve), the Minoans were the last partnership society, and I <br>
     think we will go back to it, although it may feel like matriarchal, <br>
     because we have been so used to the patriarchal.<br>

     <br>
     Are you regarding the Adam and Eve story as literal or archetypal.  <br>
     Although I think the staying power of suchs myths implies that they <br>
     have archetypal significance, any other conveyance seems to be <br>
     completely illogical (like Santa, tooth fairy, the Easter bunny).<br>
     <br>
     I am not suggesting a matriarchal dominance or hard-line rule but more <br>
     of an influence.  Considering the density of novelty and innovation <br>
     that this and the following generation will encounter, the <br>
     traditional, epoch-long pendulum swings of power may be rendered moot <br>
     by advances of reproduction, mortality extension and a reassessment of <br>
     existing cultural "norms" between the "sexes".<br>
