<p>
No. Scientifically there is no way the copy could obtain the information that <br>
he was a "copy", you'd have to invoke religious mumbo jumbo.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;the copy is not you.  Unless you have some way of superimposing the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;copy onto the original, the copy will be in a different location         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;than the originial. This fact, in itself, is a fundamental         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;difference. </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
You're in a different position than you were 5 minutes ago, does that make <br>
you a different person?<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>      &gt;For  example...  say in a galaxy far, far away there is a planet that      </i><br>
<i>      &gt;developed life exactly like ours.  On this planet, by pure coincidence,      </i><br>
<i>      &gt;there just happens to be a human being *exactly* like you,      </i><br>
<i>      &gt;sub-atomic-particle by sub-atomic-particle. Is this person you? I would      </i><br>
<i>      &gt;say not, even though he has exactly the same structure as you.</i><br>
             <br>
<p>
OK, Suppose an exact duplicate of the earth, and it's entire ecosystem, were <br>
made a billion light years away. The duplicate world would need some sort of <br>
feedback mechanism to keep the worlds in synchronization, non linear effects <br>
would amplify tiny variations, even quantum fluctuations, into big <br>
differences, but this is a thought experiment so who cares. In the first two<br>
cases below the results would vary according to personalities, remember <br>
there's a lot of illogic even in the best of us.<br>
             <br>
1) I know all about the duplicate world and you put a 44 magnum to my head <br>
   and tell me in ten seconds you will blow my brains out, am I concerned ? <br>
   You bet I am because I know that your double is holding an identical gun <br>
   to the head of my double and making an identical threat.<br>
             <br>
2) I find out that for the first time since the Big Bang the worlds will <br>
   diverge, in 10 seconds you will put a bullet in my head but my double will <br>
   be spared, am I concerned ? Yes, and angry as well, in times of intense <br>
   stress nobody is very logical. My double is no longer exact because I am <br>
   going through a traumatic experience and my double is not. I'd be looking <br>
   at that huge gun and wondering what it will be like when it goes off and <br>
   if death will really be instantaneous. I'd be wondering if my philosophy <br>
   was really as sound as I thought it was and I'd also be wondering why I <br>
   get the bullet and not my double and cursing the unfairness of it all. <br>
   My (semi) double would be thinking "it's a shame about that other fellow <br>
   but I'm glad it's not me".<br>
             <br>
3) I know nothing about the duplicate world, a gun is at both our heads and <br>
   are both convinced we're going to die. One gun goes off, making a hell of <br>
   a mess, but the other gun, for inexplicable reasons misfires. In this case <br>
   NOBODY died and except for undergoing a terrifying experience I am <br>
   completely unharmed.   <br>
             <br>
The bottom line is that I don't think we have thoughts and emotions, I think <br>
we are thoughts and emotions, and the idea that the particular hardware that <br>
is rendering them changes their meaning is as crazy as my computer making the <br>
meaning of your post different from what it was on yours.<br>
