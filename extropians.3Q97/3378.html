Um, do you mean Michigan?  Or Minnesota?  Do you know there's a labor<br>
shortage in areas of Minnesota?  Or Wisconsin, where my in-laws live<br>
happily in their own house on one blue-collar salary?<br>
<p>
The poverty I worry about in the US is not your fuzzy, angst-driven<br>
complaints about long hours and insecurity (especially because I could dig<br>
up recent surveys that show these trends as very different this year).  I<br>
worry about the people who are completely excluded in participating in our<br>
economy by drug laws, sub-standard education, and welfare traps.  Fix those<br>
problems and I bet we could handle your hard cases.<br>
<p>
You seem to think that there's a fixed size of an economy, and when all the<br>
current goods are produced by robots there will be nothing for the average<br>
person to do.  Nonsense.  When everything I buy now is cheap, I'll spend<br>
money on something that hasn't been created yet.  The economy *expands*.<br>

p.s. Why does raising kinds mean I can't use a computer?<br>
<p>
p.p.s. Did you know that 65% of part-time workers don't want full-time work?<br>
<p>
p.p.p.s What does this question of your's mean, any way?<br>
