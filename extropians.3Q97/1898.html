<p>
Too bad you weren't there!  What great questions you have!  I would have<br>
loved you to be at the discussion.  This is the type of input and thinking I<br>
was looking forward to.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;1.  Emotional differences between genders arise from differing evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt;cost-benefit ratios.  Given certain new methods of reproduction, what would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;the corresponding emotional changes?  </i><br>
<p>
One concept I am interested in is autosexual or the advanced asexual.  It<br>
seems that if we had a "switch" to turn on and off sex, then we would not<br>
have the emotional preoccupations about same.  Sex, although centered in the<br>
brain, is emotional and conjures up emotions in the dance and in the act.  A<br>
choice that many may make presently and in the near future would be not<br>
eliminate sex which would affect gender.  I wonder if these non or<br>
negsexuals will be genders or species.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Given a new "gender" which reproduced</i><br>
<i>&gt;its ideas into the child's mind, would any new evolved emotions arise?  What</i><br>
<i>&gt;about triple sexuality?</i><br>
<p>
We already witness triple sexuality.  One may be take on a male disposition<br>
one day and a female disposition another day, and then on the third day be<br>
neither - androgynous or asexual.  Or, one could be a combination of all<br>
three, or something different.  These will be more defined in the near<br>
future, again.  As far as genitals, one could have both male and female<br>
genitals and then a third structure for a different type of pleasure or<br>
stimulation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2.  What if we're not evolving emotions?  If we design them ourselves, would</i><br>
<i>&gt;we want to invent any new emotions?  How would this affect social interaction?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Suppose parents are required by law to be incapable, emotionally, of harming</i><br>
<i>&gt;their child... how would this affect dating?  Might not both partners circle</i><br>
<i>&gt;cautiously to ensure a potential child would not be harmed by the other?</i><br>
<p>
This is an important issue.  As we become less and less biological, we will<br>
be shedding aspects of our biology.  Nerves will eventually start to be come<br>
eliminated.  In doing so, we will decide what sensations, feelings, we will<br>
want to maintain.  We may decide that we only want pleasurable feelings, and<br>
just a smidgen of pain -- as a reminder or red flag. <br>
<p>
As we grow more extropic as transhumans, we will also be shedding emotions<br>
that do not serve our needs.  We will be develop our emotions as "refined<br>
emotions."  We can start doing that now by raising our EI (emotional<br>
intelligence).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3.  How would thoughtsharing of various types affect sexual mores?  Define an</i><br>
<i>&gt;Augmented human as a "primary" human supported by several other experts</i><br>
<i>&gt;sharing the world through virtual reality and communicating continuously,</i><br>
<i>&gt;waking and sleeping, on subvocal/subconscious/hypnotic channels.  (Augmented</i><br>
<i>&gt;humans are addressed as "Augmented Sally" to emphasize that you're talking to</i><br>
<i>&gt;everyone, not just Sally.)  If Augmented Sally and Augmented Fred have sex,</i><br>
<i>&gt;how would this affect the Augmentations, which could be of mixed genders?\</i><br>
<p>
This scenario is a good example of the possibilities that lay ahead.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Note that none of these questions address uploading.</i><br>
<i>&gt;You all know why...</i><br>
<p>
Yet, an upload inhabit any shape or form.  What if an upload wanted to<br>
explore "early transhuman" sexuality? <br>
