Nathan Myhrvold founded and manages the Microsoft research lab.  He gave a<br>
speech at the ACM97 conference which was held March 3-5 1997 in which he<br>
discussed the "future of software". The most interesting part of the<br>
speech was about "uploading" or "humans as software". This idea is<br>
commonplace for extropians but unknown to many and dismissed by many. <br>
Myhrvold appeared to take the possibility of "uploading" seriously and<br>
suggested he might want to do it himself.  I was not at ACM97 but was able<br>
to watch Myhrvold's speech by using streaming video on the web with a<br>
Vxtreme plug-in.<br>

can be used to access the speech.<br>

<a href="http://www.vxtreme.com/live/acm97/live.html">http://www.vxtreme.com/live/acm97/live.html</a> <br>
can be used to access other speeches from ACM97 by, for example, Gordon<br>
Bell, Carver Mead, Bruce Sterling.<br>
<p>
The Vxtreme streaming video worked fine for me when I watched these talks<br>
several months ago. I suspect it is still operative, but I can not check<br>
now because my windows machine is crashed.  Hope that does not happen<br>
often to future uploads.<br>
