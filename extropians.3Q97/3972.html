Sorry Max, my granfathers ghost will come and haunt me if I don't do this...<br>

<p>
Ahem, that's not precisely what I said I: (check the post if you want)<br>
<p>
 -&gt;Holland is now the most healty economy of the EC, and one of the<br>
 -&gt;best coutry's in the world to invest in, because of it's,<br>
 -&gt;stability according to a recent survey.<br>
<p>
Performance (growth) is one of the measuraments of an economy. As I also<br>
stated in the same mail that we sometimes lack a bit in innovation (here we<br>
can learn from the US). If you want raw growth: go to some Asian country,<br>
or Ukraine.<br>
be ready to pull out fast though, if something goes wrong. If you want<br>
stable, sustainable, long term growth; then look to us. It's a matter of<br>
priority.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;One of the most important statistics that</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;government's publish is the unemployment</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;rate. Many in and out of government use it</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;to determine how well the government is</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;doing, an economic feedback loop of sorts.</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;Just like many statistics, however, this statistic</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;can be manipulated as easily as play-doh.</i><br>
<p>
I can't argue here in as there are three kind of lies:<br>
nasty lies, sweet lies and statistics ;-)<br>
This works both ways of course.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;Due to its rather low official unemployment rate,</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;Continental European statesmen are looking</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;towards the Netherlands for guidance on how</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;to achieve social security and economic growth</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;at the same time. Hans Tietmeyer, President of</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;Bundesbank calls the Netherlands, "the model</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;country, the example of the continent."</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;Wolfgang Schauble, the parliamentary leader</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;of the German Christian Democrats says that,</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;"the Dutch appear, after 15 years, to have largely</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;succeeded in reforming their economic system</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;without forfeiting the solidarity which is</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;characteristic of their society."</i><br>
<p>
This method of cooperation between workers and employers is reffered to as<br>
the "Polder model". A 'polder' is an area of land gained by putting a dike<br>
around it and pumping all the water out. About 60% of Dutch landsurface is<br>
polder (below sea-level). Solidarity has been one af the cornerstones of<br>
all our social and economic policy-making for 50 years. It is supported by<br>
the vast majority of the population.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;Sorry Wolfgang, but appearances are often deceiving.</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;The wage bargaining system created 15 years</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;ago in the Netherlands has created relative</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;labor peace -- proportionally the Netherlands</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;loses less days each year to strikes than any</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;other Western country -- but what it hasn't achieved</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;is economic growth. Don't get us wrong, the</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;thought of workers and managers holding hands</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;and going shoulder to shoulder towards</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;economic growth is an appealing idea, especially</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;after the major hassles created by the UPS strike.</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;The Dutch model, however, simply doesn't work. </i><br>
<p>
It doesn't? Jeez. Then why is the current governement able to lower defecit<br>
spending, reduce the national debt, raise expenditure on health- and<br>
elderlycare, environment and various other fields and *still* able to lower<br>
taxes by a significant margin *in the same year* (!!).<br>
If this is 'not working', then I'll have a 'not working' system any day of<br>
the week. ;-) thankyouverymuch.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;According to the OECD, the broad unemployment</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;rate in the Netherlands is 27.1% of the people who</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;are of working age. Broad unemployment is defined</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;as people of working age who live off welfare benefits</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;or receive some subsidized employment. The</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;number of people who are officially ill and drawing</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;disability benefit or are on sick leave outnumber those</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;that are officially unemployed. The Dutch labor</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;participation rate is only 62.4%, as compared to</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;68.8% in Germany, 73.7% in the UK, and 77.3% in</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;the US. Dick Horringa, a Dutch consultant, compares</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;this phenomenon with what happened in the former</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;Communist states, which also had low official</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;unemployment yet high broad unemployment.</i><br>
<p>
Being called Dick in holland can be bad, being called 'Dick' an<br>
english-speaking country must be horrible ;-)  <br>
(sorry that's just for the 'commie' reference)<br>
<p>
Seriouly though: FACT is that Holland is, at this point, the *only* country<br>
(aside from Luxemburg) that can live up to the economic demands to<br>
participate in a common Eropean currency. The UK can't, Germany can't,<br>
France is in big trouble. Note that the demands were agreed on by *all*<br>
EC-country's.<br>
<p>
We have a relative low work-participation, this is true. As the article<br>
states however the 27.1% figure includes anyone who has a subsidized job.<br>
What's a subsidized job? All civil servants? People receiving an small<br>
income for doing governement-subsidized socialwork? Maybe the entire Dutch<br>
agricultural sector, that's as heavely subsidised as anywhere in Europe. Or<br>
the Dutch avaition-industry, also heavily supported by the state through<br>
special tax-laws (just like in most country's BTW).<br>
<p>
About 3.3 million people do paid-work in Holland (if we convert eveything<br>
to 40hrs/week), out of 15 million. The rest of the population is in<br>
school/university, retired and not working for medical reasons (we have<br>
very strict laws on that). About 300.000 are unemployed in the classical<br>
sense, this figure is dropping.<br>
<p>
Since solidarity is so important here it's not a problem if few people work<br>
as long as those few people generate sufficiant means for everybody to live<br>
on.<br>
That they do, average-income maybe lower than in the US. But it's not like<br>
we're poor.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;Perhaps Continental policy-makers should stop</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;looking for some hybrid "third way" that allows them</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;to avoid free-market reforms and simply do what</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;needs to be done to promote long-term economic</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;growth. Not using fake numbers would be a good start.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah yeah! That's it! stop looking for alternative solutions! that'll never<br>
get us anywhere! Just run along with some other economic model that<br>
messed-up most the *other* European economies! Privitase everything like<br>
they did in England. God beware if we ever have to acknowledge that maybe<br>
there are workable alternatives to a total free market, that'll be the day.<br>
No, we'll just say some stuff about unemployment and deny any other<br>
inconvienient economic indicators (such as defecit spending, national debt,<br>
inflation, interest-rates and average income).<br>
<p>
I realize that it's not a good thing to say 'It's so great here' 'bout your<br>
own country all the time so after having corrected some *factually* wrong<br>
statements I'll do some 'ol fashion complaing:<br>
- There's a lot of dog-crap everywhere, I step in it all the time. It's a<br>
mess.<br>
- You can never find a parking space (I hear - I do not own a car yet ;-)<br>
- It's too crowded! 1000 persons per sq Km (average).<br>
- The trains are often late, and the cofee they serve sucks too!<br>
- And we still have slow Net-connections...<br>
<p>
So you see: it ain't paradise (we'll keep trying though).<br>
<p>
Back to work on the Dutch Alcor branch.<br>
