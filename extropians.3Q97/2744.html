<i>&gt;self-replicators we are trying to build need not be optimised in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;sense that cars need to be, if they are to be acceptable to car </i><br>

<i>&gt;steerable automobiles on four wheels or something like that; not to </i><br>
<i>&gt;car that could be sold today.</i><br>
<p>
Any self-replicator has a much harder job than a steerable car.  Based on Von<br>
Neumann's estimates, even in a tank with semi-processed raw materials, you'll<br>
need about 250,000 parts in a sophisticated (i.e., well-designed ) system.<br>
 Carl's point (I think) was that that is roughly comparable to a modern car -<br>
an early car is much simpler.  The analogy "simple car"="simple replicator"<br>
is not correct, in the same way that "simple cart"!="simple car".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;To build an optimised nano </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;self-reproducing device would be much harder than simply to make </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;something useful that can replicate. For example, a universal Turing </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;machine has been constructed in Conway's Life world. The entity is </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;very big and it was hard, but nothing near a thousands of genius-year </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;task, to do it. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Nobody has presented a self-replicating Life system.  All Conway did</i><br>
was<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; produce a feasibility proof, so you know it *can* be done.  Actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; designing such a system is still considered not yet possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Really? I thought I've heard that the Universal Turing machine was </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;actually designed, with streams of gliders serving as tape etc. But I </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;may be wrong, in which case I'm glad you pointed it out. Do you have </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;any references?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "The Recursive Universe" by William Poundstone.  It has a good layman's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; description of Conway's proof, and some guesstimates of what it would take</i><br>
to<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; actually make a self-replicating Life computer (conclusion: no time soon).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't have that book handy, but now I'm beginning to suspect that </i><br>
<i>&gt;what Poundstond makes guesstimates about is constructing such a </i><br>
<i>&gt;gadget in the real world. What we were talking about was Conway's </i><br>
<i>&gt;universal Turing machine in the Life world (a mathematical model). </i><br>
<i>&gt;I think Carl Feynman said that he was aquainted with Conway's proof </i><br>
<i>&gt;and thought that going to the detailed design was only a matter of </i><br>
<i>&gt;filling in some details. </i><br>
<p>
No.  Poundstone was talking about programming a self-replicating Life system<br>
in your typical Life simulator.  He concluded that actually designing the<br>
system - without even implementing it on a simulator - would be a whopper of<br>
a task.  Roughly speaking, the life computer has to generate billions of<br>
precisely timed and spaced gliders at arbitrary times, places (within the<br>
computer), and directions.  It is a truly monumental task.  Yes, it's all<br>
details, but soooooo many ...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(Did you really think that I believed that </i><br>
<i>&gt;somebody had built a Life world replicator in the real world out of </i><br>
<i>&gt;cogwheels or whatever?)</i><br>
<p>
No.  I thought you thought that somebody had programmed a self-replicating<br>
Life entity.<br>
