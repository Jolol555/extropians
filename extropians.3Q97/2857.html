I have recently read the autobiography of Alan Watts (IN MY OWN WAY) who<br>
was an interpreter of Zen Buddhism to the hippie generation of the 60s.<br>
I find his concept of the self to be similar to Marvin Minsky's SOCIETY<br>
OF MIND in which the self is illusory.<br>
<p>
Watts on page 47 states " the ego named Alan Watts is an illusion, a<br>
social institution, a fabrication of words and symbols without the<br>
slightest substantial reality; that is it will be utterly forgotten<br>
within five hundred years, any that my physical organism will shortly<br>
pass off into dust and ashes.  And I have no illusions that some sort of<br>
proprietary and individual soul, spook, or ghost will outlast it."<br>
<p>
and on page 197: " Christians hardly ever consider changing<br>
consciousness itself, but assume that the usual feeling of "I" is our<br>
sensation of the soul and not a socially sanctioned hallucination. "<br>
<p>
Now if I am interpreting what I read of Minsky's view of an illusory<br>
protagonist that we call our self and Watts view that there is no sort<br>
of "proprietary" and individual soul, spook, or ghost, what would be the<br>
sense of thinking of uploading our wetware to have eternal existence?  I<br>
mean,  that which  is in our brains, that we identify as our proprietary<br>
selves is illusory, consisting of data input over our lifetimes.<br>
According to Minsky and Watts there is no "you".<br>
<p>
Perhaps Extropians should be thinking of Moravec's mind children and<br>
instead of seeking eternal individual existence, just merge into the<br>
Matrix what we can contribute.<br>
<p>
I found Watts to be prescient on many issues relating to the Cyber<br>
Culture.  On page 98 of his autobiography, IN MY OWN WAY,  he states<br>
"Chinese is a far better language for mind-training than Latin or Greek<br>
because it is the most highly evolved and sophisticated language least<br>
like our own.  Thus the patterns of thought upon which it is based bring<br>
out, by contrast, the implicit and largely unrecognized patterns of<br>
thought which underlie our own tongue-as that "events&lt;" represented by<br>
verbs, must be set in motion by "things," represented by nouns.<br>
Furthermore, anything said in English may be said in half the time in<br>
Chinese, while German and Japanese take twice the time.  Some form of<br>
written Chinese would also be a marvelous language for computers,<br>
because it can be read at high speed, and because each character, or<br>
ideogram, is a nonlinear Gestalt, or configuration."  Alan Watts wrote<br>
that back in 1972.<br>
