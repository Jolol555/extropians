        I'm working on a morning flight to _anywhere_ but here<br>
        <br>
        I'm watching this evening fire burn away my tears<br>
<p>
        All my life I've left my troubles by the door<br>
<p>
        Leaving is all I've ever known before<br>
<p>
<p>
        It's not the way you hold me when the sun goes down<br>
<p>
        It's not the way you called my name that left me<br>
<p>
        Stranded on the ground<br>
<p>
        It's not the way you say you hear my heart when the music ends<br>
<p>
        I am just learning how to fly away again<br>
<p>
<p>
        And maybe you were thinkin' that you thought you knew me well<br>
<p>
        But, no-one ever knows the heart of anyone else<br>
<p>
        I feel like Garbo in this late night grande hotel<br>
<p>
        Cause living alone is all I've ever done well<br>
<p>

             ... I'll survive this -- if I'm alone<br>
<p>
            I'm a survivor, but you will be gone   <br>

"The circumstances rendered the NVA vulnerable to the b-52s at a moment in <br>
the war when experience and technology had perfected the employment of the <br>
bombers.  The strategic air command had learned during the siege of khe <br>
Sanh that three B-52s provided enough destructive effect to satisfy most <br>
ground commanders.  SAC now launched the planes in flights of three rather <br>
than the original six in order to duoble the number of Arc Lights.  A new <br>
radar system named Combat Skyspot made it possible to place the strikes <br>
within five-eighths of a mile of friendly positions. (Rhotenberry and Ba <br>
did not hesitate to call a strike within 700 yards.)  The location of the <br>
'box', the target zone that was five-eighths of a mile wide by <br>
approximately two miles long, could be changed up to three hours before <br>
the bombs were scheduled to fall.  Rhotenberry kept a list of every B-52 <br>
strike allocated to the battle with the drop time and change time marked <br>
in order to switch the box to a new location and catch the NVA in it when <br>
an assault was imminent or underway against a sector of the perimeter...<br>
<p>
<p>
Ba was able to give the tank-killer teams he formed some psychological <br>
preparation by having them practice firing the M-72 LAW at junked aRVN <br>
tank hulls.  The Pentagon had time to respond to an appeal from Abrams and <br>
rush out an experimental helicopter-mounted system for the American <br>
wire-guided anti-tank missile, called the TOW for tube-launched <br>
optically-tracked, wire-guided....<br>
<p>
Larry Stern of the _Washington Post_ had met Vann in the mid-1960s throgh <br>
Frank Scotton.  He came to pleiku to interview him and was astonished by <br>
the man he found.  He had never seen a person so suffused with rage and <br>
exhaltation.  Stern remembered the wasy Vann's eyes 'burned' as he <br>
described how he was wielding the B-52 bombers...<br>
<p>
<p>
Vann's friend, George Jacobson, stayed until the end.  He left on a <br>
helicopter from the roof of the embassy not long before dawn on April 30, <br>
1975, to take refuge aboard a Seventh Fleet ship off Vung Tau an the nVA <br>
tanks were preparing to move into Saigon.  John Vann was not meant to flee <br>
to a ship at sea, and he did not miss his exit.  <br>
<p>
He died believing that he had won his war.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;From Neil Sheehan, "A Bright Shining Lie", [1988].</i><br>
<p>
John Paul Vann was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery, where two <br>
of my relatives were also laid to rest.<br>
