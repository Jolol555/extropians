A couple of weeks ago someone was asking about the Earth passing through <br>
dust clouds in space. Here's the Risks article I mentioned (from Risks <br>
Digest 19.23)... should be exciting:<br>

Subject: 1998-1999 Leonids may damage satellites<br>
<p>
An article in the 9 Jun 1997 issue of *Science News* warned that the Leonid<br>
meteor showers in 1998 and 1999 may damage satellites.  The Leonid meteor<br>
shower occurs around the middle of November and usually 100 meteors an hour<br>
may be visible. In the Far East in 1998, 100,000 meteors an hour may be<br>
visible. In 1999 there will also be a very heavy Leonid shower in Western<br>
Europe.<br>
<p>
"A Leonid storm occurs every 33 years, when Earth passes through the<br>
meteoroid storm shortly after Temple-Tuttle has neared the sun and spewed<br>
fresh particles. On 17 Nov 1998, Earth will hit the Leonid stream just 9<br>
months after the comet has passed closet to the sun.  In that short<br>
interval, the torrent of new meteoroids won't have had time to spread out.<br>
Our planet will encounter a dense swath of debris, creating a veritable<br>
tempest.<br>
<p>
"The dust particles are tiny, so chance collisions with spacecraft aren't<br>
the prime worry of scientists. Rather, researchers express concern about the<br>
potential of these particles to create localized clouds of electric charge,<br>
or plasma, that can penetrate satellites and short-circuit equipment.<br>
<p>
"The high speed of a Leonid meteoroid - about 72 kilometers per second, more<br>
than three times that of an average meteoroid - favors the production of<br>
clouds of charged material, notes Brown. These can generate lightninglike<br>
discharges inside satellites, zapping fragile electric components.<br>
<p>
"Another meteor storm, this one associated with a swath of cometary debris<br>
known as the Perseids, is credited with taking a satellite out of commission<br>
in 1993 (SN: 2 Oct 1993, p. 217). However, the potential for damage is highly<br>
uncertain...  Come 1998, 'everyone is going to go through this test, whether<br>
they like it or not.'"<br>
