Lots of stuff I've picked up here and there- especially the physiologically<br>
oriented research on myelinisation of the infant brain towards the end<br>
of pregnancy being sufficient to mediate some emotional responses. Also<br>
cognitive psychology as a whole, which suggests the general pattern that<br>
the brain works that way (lock/key) - e.g. Dennet, Edelman. Also Oliver<br>
Sacks' book on deaf people learning language (was it? - my memory is<br>
really pretty crap, so I'm the wrong person to ask for precise details<br>
about anything!)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Artificial wombs would have many positive benefits, for sure, but I</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; infant shifts position, mother shifts position, stuff like that).  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That ought to be noticeable in the sheep that are brought up this way</i><br>

<i>&gt;important with a more natural artificial womb the lambs ought to show</i><br>
<i>&gt;averse emotional reactions when brought up. </i><br>
<p>
Hmm - would we recognise what a disturbed lamb would be like?  That sort<br>
of thing requires a bit of the old *verstehen* I think, and I'm not so<br>
confident that the kinds of researchers involved in these projects would<br>
notice - not that they're bad of course (it's not their speciality), but<br>
I would be more confident if they recognised the importance of the kind<br>
of point I am making, and had (say) some cognitive psychologists or<br>
maybe even psychotherapists along for the ride, looking out for just<br>
this sort of problem.  I do think it's extremely important to check this<br>
out before we create a generation of psychos by accident or oversight.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My personal main worry about the procedure (as shown in the brief</i><br>
<i>&gt;film clip I saw) was that the womb was transparent and in a lighted</i><br>
<i>&gt;room. I'm not certain, but this *could* affect the development of</i><br>
<i>&gt;vision (both positively and negatively). </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We'll see when the data is published. </i><br>
<p>
I hope so - as I say, I'm not that confident that the kind of scientist<br>
involved in this kind of research is competent to notice the kind of<br>
problems we're talking about.<br>
