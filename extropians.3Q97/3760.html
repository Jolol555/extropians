"Schaffer Library of Drug Policy" has some interesting information on <br>
this subject-<a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/basicfax.htm#q3">http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/basicfax.htm#q3</a><br>

            How many people are actually killed by drugs?<br>
<p>
<p>
The number of drug deaths in the US in a typical year is as follows: <br>
<p>
<p>
               Tobacco kills about 390,000. <br>
               Alcohol kills about 80,000. <br>
               Sidestream smoke from tobacco kills about 50,000. <br>
               Cocaine kills about 2,200. <br>
               Heroin kills about 2,000. <br>
               Aspirin kills about 2,000. <br>
               Marijuana kills 0. There has never been a recorded death <br>
               due to marijuana at any time in US history. <br>
   <br>
      All illegal drugs combined kill about 4,500 people per year, or   <br>
      about one percent of the number killed by alcohol and tobacco.    <br>
      Tobacco kills more people each year than all of the people killed <br>
      by all of the illegal drugs in the last century. <br>

I have a gut-level feeling that even though Eliezer S. Yudkowsky is <br>
"convinced that drugs are evil", he doesn't include "aspirin" in his <br>
definition---even though "aspirin kills about 2,000" individuals a year <br>
and it is a drug. Yet I'd bet he includes marijuana in his definition, <br>
even though marijuana kills 0 and the hemp plant has mind-numbing <br>
industrial uses. Indeed, using an "evolved virus" for such purposes <br>
would be truly evil.<br>
