Some thoughts prompted by Max's talk Saturday.<br>
<p>
Max mentioned one or more of Greg Egan's stories about artificial<br>
personality.  I'd add to the list George Alec Effinger's Arab trilogy:<br>
When Gravity Fails, A Fire in the Sun, third title forgotten.<br>
<p>
I thought for a moment that I might like a treatment to help me purge<br>
myself of hypocrisy.  ("If your beliefs don't make you a little bit<br>
uncomfortable, they're not radical enough." -LNS)  But on second thought<br>
it wouldn't sell.<br>
<p>
An immaterial mind might make its avatar literally "all ears" to<br>
indicate polite attention.  Even better would be the ability to<br>
reassign part of one's processing power from a function not being<br>
used at the moment to processing and understanding voices.<br>
<p>
What parts of us are most important to other people's view of our<br>
identity?  Values, ethics?  Conversational style?<br>
<p>
There's room for a short story about strange attractors in personality<br>
space.  Suppose I want to be more like Alice, but one of Alice's deep<br>
traits is that she wants to be more like Bob, but Bob ...<br>
<p>
For a biographical encyclopedia of the far future, birth/death dates<br>
will not be the most useful.  Maybe it will give only a floruit ("known<br>
to be active at date X"); where someone's life is well known, it might<br>
be meaningful to state a period during which the personality's similarity<br>
to that of the floruit is over a threshold.<br>
