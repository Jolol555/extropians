In a message dated 97-07-17 16:47:52 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; t's these kinds of contradictions, inconsistencies in people's beliefs<br>
that<br>
 lead to the bad memes responsible for a declining society &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
An excellent post.  But I have a nit to pick.  I think the concept of<br>
"declining society" is itself a meme....and a very debiliting one.  To my<br>
understanding relegions derive much of their power from guilt.  That guilt is<br>
based upon "fall from grace".  Or a prior "Golden Age".  I don't buy it.  <br>
<p>
Reading the works of Julian Simon is one of the reasons I don't buy it.<br>
<p>
I'm just a dumb truck driver.  But I assisted my wife in raising a son.  He's<br>
OK. And his wife and he are raising my GrandKids.  Doing a good job best I<br>
can tell.  They, as did I and my wife, have a PRIME TENET of child raising.<br>
<p>
"NEVER LIE TO THE KID"<br>
<p>
If you don't know....tell him.<br>
If you don't want him to know..tell him.<br>
<p>
but never lie<br>
<p>
Santa claus...the tooth fairy....relegion...and other modern fantasies<br>
qualify as lies.<br>
<p>
Cynicysm is a virtue....as is paranoia....(when my boy was a lad...going door<br>
to door on Halloween nite...the first thing he would do upon returning home<br>
was to inspect the loot...(his idea..not ours)..on the kitchen table each<br>
piece was critically examined....anything  that appeared that it may have<br>
been tampered with was sumarilly rejected...right into the trash....really<br>
not interested in eating apples with needles in the or candy with dope...<br>
<p>
He...and I...continue with this mindset.<br>
<p>
Be interesting to continue this topic...but I gota go<br>
