I've heard even more bizarre stories (a friend of mine was actually <br>
arrested in a similar situation but a pocket knife was found on him during <br>
the search...$200 fine and 1 year probation for carrying a concealed weapon <br>
on top of the 'interference'.  It would have taken an additional $500 in <br>
lawyer fees (on top of the $500 he paid) to appeal the sentence (with the <br>
additional hazard of possible jail time if the case was lost).  His lawyer <br>
quipped something about the judge 'must be having marital problems again'. <br>
 My friend thought the lawyer was joking but apparently sentences DO depend <br>
somewhat on the mental state of the presiding judge at the moment of <br>
sentencing.<br>
<p>
(Yes I know, rare isolated cases....that is, until it happens to YOU.)<br>
<p>
We've discussed what would have happened if it was a journalist as the <br>
'interferer'.  We concluded there would be no arrest and all information <br>
would have been given (especially if it was a TV crew).  Kinda sad.<br>
<p>
I understand that police are now living in paranoia what with all the cop <br>
killings going on.  I do not understand the blatant hostility that police <br>
seem to exhibit more and more frequently.  I use to think that the 'Protect <br>
and Serve' posted on police vehicles was directed toward ME.  I now know it <br>
means to protect and serve the state (community), individuals are dangerous <br>
and untrustworthy.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately humans do live in societies with laws and regulations <br>
enforced by a system in which they have next to no control over.<br>
<p>
I wonder how such things as a life sentence would be determined/carried out <br>
IF in the future a consciousness could be uploaded into a matrix or <br>
biotechnology allowed a cybernetic life extension of century+.  It may be <br>
better to have a society in place able to deal with such things before such <br>
technology makes it possible.<br>
<p>
It scares me at some of the things I've found out are 'illegal', and even <br>
more scared at what additional things you can be charged with.  'Ignorance <br>
of the law is no excuse'.  I wonder where that came from.  Of course it's <br>
an excuse!  If you'd known it was illegal you probably wouldn't have done <br>
it.  Blind justice doesn't mean reasonless justice.  (I wonder how many <br>
judges know ALL the laws in the jurisdiction they preside over...including <br>
those silly ones left over from over a hundred years ago that were never <br>
taken off the books?  I just saw a documentary where it once was illegal to <br>
take a bath in Boston.  The puritanical ethics there at the time determined <br>
one should concern oneself with spiritual purity and taking a bath was <br>
considered a concentration on matters of the flesh.  Funny, but the <br>
documentary never divulged if the law ever expired or was revoked.)<br>
