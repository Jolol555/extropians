<i>&gt;Huh? How does this follow? We have had the technology to alter the</i><br>
<i>&gt;human germ line for several years by now as far as I know (the point</i><br>
<i>&gt;is that nobody did it/was allowed to), but that doesn't mean we know</i><br>
<i>&gt;how to do many useful alterations. </i><br>
<p>
Aging also involves macroscopice changes in various tissues. The cornea<br>
has to keep growing in order to remain transparent, cartilage of the <br>
ears and nose continously grow throughout life, and so on.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Adding antioxidant genes might be a good start. Another is promoting</i><br>
<i>&gt;more DNA repair (expensive in nature, we can afford it), which would</i><br>
<i>&gt;decrease the risk for cancer. </i><br>
<p>
This sounds plausible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;More in the future things like (say) </i><br>
<i>&gt;linking the telomerase gene with an artificial promotor so that you</i><br>
<i>&gt;can activate it by an injection of a drug, lengthening your telomeres</i><br>
<i>&gt;under medical supervision. </i><br>
<p>
Lengthening telomeres doesn't look as promising as it did a year ago.<br>
Apparently it can decrease cell division life or not affect it at all,<br>
depending on still unknown factors.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Not only that, but as our knowledge grows to gradually create</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; completely new species of humans. Yet no-one seems interested about</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; this.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;New species are not a goal per se; what would we (or they) use them</i><br>
<i>&gt;for?</i><br>
<p>
Other environments.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Perhaps Perry M. is right and this list has declined to the point</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that people are so inward looking that they can't even notice</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; history marching past outside. </i><br>
<p>
Just because you don't get a response posted to the list does not<br>
mean that people didn't read it and think about it. It is not<br>
possible to keep up with everything. I only read maybe 30% of the<br>
messages, and reply to maybe 1%.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Perhaps. But it might also be that we are so used to dramatic</i><br>
<i>&gt;revolutions every week... </i><br>
<p>
Yah!! Very tough to stay on top of it all.<br>
