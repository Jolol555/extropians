<i>&gt; &gt;You must be joking!  Isn't one of the great whinges of our time how</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;terribly difficult it is to cope with progress and competition in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;computers?  Continuous upgrading seems to be the norm.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think the progress on the hardware side has been great. However, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; there wasn't continuous upgrading then Microsoft and Intel (Wintel)</i><br>
<i>&gt; would go out of business.  Microsoft comes out with a new, more bloated</i><br>
<i>&gt; version of their software, and Intel in turn has to come out with a new</i><br>
<i>&gt; and faster chip for it to run on.  Have you ever noticed that it takes</i><br>
<i>&gt; Windows 95 longer to load on a Pentium than Win 3.1 on a early version</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the 486?  If you consider Windows 95 progress then you haven't really</i><br>
<i>&gt; fathomed the potential software that could really be done on these</i><br>
<i>&gt; supercomputer chips we now posses. Microsoft and Intel are in bed</i><br>
<i>&gt; together to insure future business and market share. If you have not</i><br>
<i>&gt; noticed this, then you must be kidding!</i><br>
<p>
1) hardware advances are expanding faster than OS advances. Evidence:<br>
Prices for then year standard configurations are lower, allowing one to<br>
buy more than the minimum necessary for even the "bloated" new system.<br>
<p>
2)Granted bloat is a problem, and the fact that so many businesses are<br>
not upgrading their systems as fast as MS thought they would is causing<br>
them to make some changes in their priorities for their newer versions<br>
yet to come out. However, much of the bloat is unavoidable as new<br>
systems need to be able to be compatible with all of the older versions,<br>
etc., so as time goes on, there are more and more filters, links, calls,<br>
etc. that an OS must handle.<br>
<p>
3)the base PC systems offered by the big names that many people buy<br>
because they are so affordable are absolute crap. They are extremely<br>
detuned versions, like HP's initial pentium offering of a 75MHz system<br>
with only 8 megs of ram, when responsible people were using a minimum of<br>
100 MHz chips to run Win95.<br>
<p>
It really shouldn't matter how long it takes Win95 to start up. For<br>
starters, it still starts faster than a Mac, and secondly, if you had<br>
sufficient RAM it actually starts faster than Win 3.1 (its 32 bits mean<br>
that its processing twice as much information as well). THirdly and<br>
finally, what IS important is how fast applications run on the OS, and I<br>
can say that any application will run faster on 95 than on 3.1 (because<br>
the same version of Word, for example is 16 bits, it will run<br>
approximately twice as fast on a 32 bit OS as on a 16 bit OS.<br>
<p>
Also, if you are running on an ISA bus, it is no wonder, as the ISA bus<br>
was not built to handle 32 bit processing.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The only way corporations can possibly coerce is by means of</i><br>
<i>&gt; government.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;When people say 'corporate coercion' in the usual sense, it's just</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;another whine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I definitly have to disagree here.  Lets me diverge for a moment.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; consider myself an anarchist.  A "true" anarchy is where individuals can</i><br>
<i>&gt; do anything they want as long as it dosen't interfere with anothers</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom.  If an individual or group of individuals grabs a bunch of arms</i><br>
<i>&gt; and starts terrorizing the rest of the people in this "anarchy" into</i><br>
<i>&gt; submission, then we no longer have "anarchy" but a new form of</i><br>
<i>&gt; authoritarianism..  Now back to corporations...</i><br>
<p>
In an anarchy, every citizen will understand that their own self defense<br>
is their own responsibility. THose that don't deserve their fate.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's corporations that are increasingly requiring piss tests to get a</i><br>
<i>&gt; job.  Imagine if you had to take a random piss test from the government</i><br>
<i>&gt; just to stay in "good citizen" status and not be thrown in jail!  Please</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't misunderstand me, I'm not defending government in any way.  What I</i><br>
<i>&gt; am saying however, is that a corpocracy is not a free-market.  A good</i><br>
<i>&gt; example was in the early part of this century when Rockefeller would</i><br>
<i>&gt; open up a new gas stations next to small independent operators.  When</i><br>
<i>&gt; one of his stations first opened they would charge less then wholsale</i><br>
<i>&gt; prices until the other guy COULD NO LONGER COMPETE and go out of</i><br>
<i>&gt; business.  As soon as the small-time operator went out of business,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rockefeller would raise the price of gas higher than the small-time guy</i><br>
<i>&gt; was originally operating at.  If you consider this practice fair-game in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a Free-Market economy, then I will have to take serious odds with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; whole concept of a "Free-Market" as you are presenting it.</i><br>
<p>
As I recall, the government can revoke your drivers license, pilots<br>
license, as well as many other "licenses" to practice simple tasks if<br>
you refuse to accede to their authroity to demand you take their piss,<br>
blood or breath tests. THey can even judge you impaired if you "fail" a<br>
simple physical dexterity test (a freind of mine who has an inner ear<br>
impairment has lost her license on site over a dozen times in the last 6<br>
years. If thats not harassment, I don't know what is). Corporations do<br>
not have the same authority.<br>
<p>
ALso, if you are an employee and are not an operating owner or partner<br>
in the firm, you have no vested interest in the company, so if you don't<br>
conform to their standards, they have every right to ask you to leave.<br>
You are not owed a job.<br>
<p>
As for the gas station monopolist, those are the breaks. If the gas<br>
station owners did not utilize public opinion to force a curtailment or<br>
accomodation, its their own damn fault. I have seen numerous communities<br>
across the country successfully fight big corporations like Walmart and<br>
Costco who wanted to come into their communities.<br>
<p>
My own town here just lost such a battle due to sheer stupidity. They<br>
had succeeded in keeping Costco out last year, but this year, Walmart<br>
dug up an old plan permit without an expiration date in the city records<br>
for the property they want to build on. They bought the permit from the<br>
guy who received it, and are now going to build a store. The local<br>
yokels were stupid in that they 1) didn't have expiration dates on<br>
building permits, and 2) they didn't buy that permit from the owner<br>
first, and 3) didn't pass an ordinance mandating a maximum square<br>
footage any retail or wholesale space can operate on.<br>
<p>
For those of you in foreign countries where Walmart and Costco have not<br>
spread the gospel of "everything for less", they are a chain of stores<br>
that typically cover at least several football fields in indoor area,<br>
you need a map to get around in, and can find just about anything you<br>
could possibly need at typcially less than half the price you will find<br>
anywhere else. Also, unlike most other retail operations, employees have<br>
an active program of freindliness and helpfulness (I think its something<br>
they put in the water) that can be disconcerting to begin with, but once<br>
you get used to it, you start to resent the rude way you are treated<br>
anywhere else.<br>
<p>
Note: This is probably why EuroDisney is so unpopular....its like an<br>
alien planet to be treated like a human being rather than a number in a<br>
socialist "paradise".<br>
