Dear Sarah, etc.<br>
<p>
Yes, I am on the leading edge of technology...<br>
<p>
....For maybe 20 minutes or so..:)<br>
<p>
But I intend to enjoy it while it lasts...<br>
<p>
And the 233 is definately better than the DX4 100 mgh....<br>
<p>
Re: Negriponti... and "Being Digital".  I usually read the book. This was a<br>
tape I listened to, probably expurgated, that was read enthusiastically by<br>
one of my favorite Athiest/ Skeptics Penn Jillette.  <br>
<p>
The book/tape is not trying to be as cutting edge as Drexler, IMHO.  <br>
<p>
More along the lines of Bill Gates' "The Road Ahead" without quite as much<br>
clarity of thought and details.<br>
<p>
In another thread, I just finished "WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A LIBERTARIAN, A<br>
Personal View" by Charles Murray.<br>
<p>
Wonderful, clear thinking, well expressed fundamentals of personal<br>
responsibility and freedom.<br>
This is the guy that wrote the controversial "The Bell Curve", which I have<br>
and intend to wade thru and skim.  It is about 2 cm thick, and I am trying to<br>
average 3 books a week and still have a life and become a millionaire, so I<br>
have learned the art of skimming.<br>
<p>
Anyway, thanks for your congrats on my 'Puter, named C3PO by my wife.  I<br>
can't wait for the voice interface module that must be on the horizon!<br>
<p>
I did see a IBM/ Microsoft product that was only $50 that claimed you could<br>
speak and have the machine type your words.  ANYONE HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH<br>
THIS OR SIMILAR PROGRAM?<br>
<p>
Warmest Regards to all,<br>
<p>
Rudi ( I need to develop a more creative screen name... this happens to be my<br>
*real* one!)<br>
