<p>
Obviously, you are an intelligent person.  More intelligent, lets say,<br>
than the average Joe and Jane.  Yet average Joes and Janes are adapting to<br>
changing work conditions right now!  Look at your country's unemployment<br>
rate-- people are working at every point in the spectrum.  How old are you<br>
that you can no longer adapt?  I hope I never reach this age.<br>
=09As for your skills becoming obsolete in 2 years, this seems like a<br>
blessing to me.  The rapidly-changing workplace is providing incentive for<br>
workers to continually educate themselves.<br>
       What event gave you this pessimistic attitude about your own<br>
abilities?  Instead of wasting time asking "why is the free market so hard<br>
to keep up with?", why don't you ask "where can I find the educational<br>
resources to make myself marketable?"  Right now, there is a MASSIVE<br>
shortage of computer programmers.  Do you think you could learn this<br>
skill?<br>
<p>
I find pessimism to be a waste of valuable time.  If you think you only<br>
have 5 years to live, why spend it being miserable?<br>
=20<br>
<i>&gt; Now this is pretty sad when I share your extropian dreams of a better=20</i><br>
<i>&gt; future while at the same time being increasingly being denied=20</i><br>
<i>&gt; opportunity from achieving them.  I am a human being and I am an extropia=</i><br>

<i>&gt; =09=09I DESERVE TO LIVE!</i><br>
<i>&gt;=20</i><br>
<i>&gt; =09=09I DESERVE TO THRIVE!</i><br>
<p>
I don't think being a human being and an extropian give you any special<br>
privileges.  I think they are a privilege in themselves.<br>
=20<br>
<i>&gt; ...and so does every other human on this planet who wants to live and=20</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a better future.</i><br>
<i>&gt;=20</i><br>
<i>&gt; Look, I want to evolve as much as the next person - but I should have=20</i><br>
<i>&gt; the right to grow at *my* pace.  Don=92t you get it?  I am evolving as=20</i><br>
<i>&gt; fast as I can!  But the free-market (an autoevolutionary and human=20</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention if there ever was one - and one which almost everyone on this l=</i><br>
ist=20<br>
<i>&gt; praises) doesn=92t give a DAMN about *my* pace.  EITHER I ADAPT TO *ITS* =</i><br>
PACE=20<br>
<i>&gt; OR DIE!   As the Bionomics Institute as so poignantly pointed out =91The=</i><br>

<i>&gt; free-market follows the dictates of biological evolution where the=20</i><br>
<i>&gt; strongest, smartest and fittest survive=92(end quote).  Now if that is no=</i><br>
t a=20<br>
<i>&gt; Fascist dictate what the fuck is?!</i><br>
<p>
The Bionomics Institute has made an observation, not a mandate.  Sometimes<br>
survival means be in alliance or even leaching off of someone who is<br>
strong and fit.  Parasites and symbiotes are an important part of<br>
evoltion.  I wouldn't say viruses are very smart, yet they seem to be<br>
doing fairly well.<br>
  Yet, you have stated that you are intelligent, and are working, so maybe<br>
some smart parasites should be leaching off you.<br>
=20<br>
<i>&gt; Again, help - I want to live!  I want to live in the amazing future=20</i><br>
<i>&gt; that is unfolding.  Shouldn=92t everyone get an *EQUAL* chance to live we=</i><br>
ll=20<br>
<i>&gt; in the future?=20</i><br>
<p>
It would be nice, but I cannot see how we can guarantee it without<br>
hindering the very progress that has increasing the standard of living.<br>
As someone said on another thread "the poor are richer"<br>
<p>
If you have the same quibble as Nadia, which was "how can the poor be<br>
rich?", I say: the same way my hand can be big and small.  My hand is big<br>
compared to my fingers, and small compard to my arm.  The poor are poor<br>
compared to the rich, but rich compared to the poor of yesterday.  These<br>
are relative terms.  By saying people are poor, you are making a<br>
normative statement.  Remember, the poverty line rises faster than<br>
inflation.  =20<br>
=20<br>
<i>&gt; Otherwise aren=92t extropians nazi=92s - either by choice or by default?</i><br>
<p>
The free market isn't a THING OUT TO GET YOU.  It's a word we use to<br>
describe a *lack* of THINGS OUT TO GET YOU.<br>
<p>
I find your nazi analogy completely ridiculous.<br>
=20<br>

Holly, I have assumed your are from the US because of the usa.net at the<br>
end of your e-mail address.  Was this a correct assumption?<br>
