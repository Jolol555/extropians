Hi!<br>
<p>
I have some questions about economical principles, some regarding<br>
free-markets and libertarian ideals and since many of you seem to<br>
support libertarianism, complete individual freedom, free-markets, etc,<br>
I wondered if you could answer my doubts.<br>
<p>
Let's start:<br>
Are most of you, extropians, libertarians?<br>
Why do you think free-markets are the best economical solution?<br>
In today's world, it's almost impossible to do something without<br>
affecting other persons, still why do you claim individual freedom and<br>
an almost cult of individual property so important?<br>
Complete freedom in economies will bring to the scene big corporations<br>
instead of small, local business. Won't this corporations have too much<br>
power and therefore harming everyone (the consumers and general public)<br>
but themselves? Do you think the economy should be based on small<br>
business or big corporations?<br>
What do you think of environmental issues? Do you think technology will<br>
always give us the solutions to all our problems?<br>
What do you think the intervention of government in economy should be?<br>
<p>
Guess that's all but I'm sure that whatever your answers will be, I'll<br>
have other questions waiting.<br>
<p>
Thanks in advance,<br>
<p>
