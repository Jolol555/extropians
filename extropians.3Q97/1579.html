Yeah, and it's even more interesting when you think of how Arab and Chinese<br>
cultures were far more technologically advanced than Europe for centuries.<br>
One theory-of-everything book that I found interesting was _Structure and<br>
Change in Economic History_, by Douglas North.  He's an economist (economic<br>
historian), and his take is that certain institutions of property were<br>
critical in allowing certain kinds of growth to occur.  Concepts like "my<br>
tribe owns this land" allowed for agriculture.  "I own this object" allowed<br>
for markets.  "I own this idea" allowed for science to create technology.<br>
As with any book like this, your milage may vary, but it's clearly written<br>
and makes for interesting thinking.<br>
<p>
And then there's David Friedman's argumen, which Dale alluded to, that<br>
small nation states created competition between nations, and nations<br>
competed to be succesful.<br>
<p>
I'm interested in this too, though my current search is for a basic book on<br>
African civilizations.<br>
<p>
Have fun,<br>
