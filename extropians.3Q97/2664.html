In a message dated 97-08-30 22:15:47 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; Actually about 30% are man made.  Theres a big difference between the<br>
two,<br>
<i> &gt; the alien ones have bent stalks, which are impossible to duplicate(the</i><br>
<i> &gt; chromosones are changed), and the man made ones are broken.  Also the real</i><br>
<i> &gt; ones are much more precise and sometimes the wheat is found braided.</i><br>
 Those<br>
<i> &gt; guys were paid to do that.</i><br>

 By whom, and for what purpose? your theory now includes:<br>
    1) Hoaxers,<br>
    2) aliens,<br>
    2) conspiracy,<br>
    4) an attempt by the aliens to communicate by essentially<br>
       the most ridiculous and difficult means possible, rather<br>
       than by some simpler means.<br>
 <br>
 The competing and simpler theory includes:<br>
    1) Hoaxers.<br>
 <br>
 Please note that crop circles have followed the usual path for<br>
 this sort of phenomenon: additional elaborations are "discovered"<br>
 only after the original incident is shown to have a natural explanation.<br>
 <br>
 The people who are initially fooled and go on record end up with<br>
 a huge psychological incentive to continue to believe, rather than<br>
 recanting and thereby looking foolish, so they selectively<br>
 grab at new observations and facts that support their position.<br>
 This is called "resolution of cognitive dissonance" and is a<br>
 well-known phenomenon.<br>
 <br>
 This will be my last post on this topic on this list, since<br>
 I feel that it is off-topic. I recommend you look into<br>
 The psychological phenomena of belief a bit. Try Sagan's<br>
 "the Demon-Haunted World" for starts.<br>
 <br>
 We investigate a lot of radical ideas on this list, but<br>
 we try to stay firmly grounded in science. The real universe<br>
 is so amazing that IMO pseudo-science trivializes it.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
You are going off on your own beliefs. It is scientifically proven that they<br>
have been changed molecularly(the chromosomes), and the hoaxers didnt do<br>
that.<br>
