<i> &gt; I'm not certain that "hardcoded into our brains by the genes" is</i><br>

<i> &gt; I'm not promoting a deterministic view), such as walking.  We have</i><br>

<i> &gt; utilize it.  There are some bodies of knowledge, however, that</i><br>
<i> &gt; arise in us naturally and not through sense data simply by the</i><br>
<i> &gt; "structure" of the brain.  Now given, the brain is determined by</i><br>
<i> &gt; biology, but the information that it percieves can in some instances</i><br>
<i> &gt; arise by the _very nature_ and structure of the brain, not by the</i><br>
<i> &gt; genetic information composing it.  Mathematics is one of these</i><br>
<i> &gt; bodies of knowledge, I don't believe that it was written in our</i><br>
<i> &gt; genes to discover mathematics, but rather it arose naturally as a</i><br>
<i> &gt; benefit of the way in which our minds percieve.  Seeing in three</i><br>
<i> &gt; dimensions is another example, if somewhat more "physical".  It</i><br>
<i> &gt; isn't "hardcoded", but rather is by the very structure of our eyes</i><br>
<i> &gt; and brain to percieve this way (imagine percieving naturally in</i><br>
<i> &gt; other dimensions...).</i><br>
<p>
"Hardcoded into our brains by the genes" was, perhaps, an overstatement.<br>
I certainly did *not* mean to imply that I think that the Human<br>
Genome Project is going to stumble across the genes for "structural<br>
perception of space". That's just barely possible, only because it<br>
seems we still know so little about human ontogenesis, but seems<br>
unlikely to me.<br>
<p>
But our brains do have a physical structure that allows for the<br>
development of a neurocomputational machine with properties similar<br>
to, but much more sophisticated (and kludge-ridden) than the<br>
artificial neural networks people have been playing with since the<br>
perceptrons, and much more since the late 1980s.  And I suspect<br>
that many of the "a priori" information structures are going to<br>
turn out to be implicit in that style of computation. What our<br>
genes code for is the production of tissue that can carry out that<br>
kind of signal analysis, computation, and output motor-vector<br>
generation. It codes for the neural architecture, indirectly, via<br>
the proteins and the control genes that determine the sequence in<br>
which proteins are constructed and the stimuli which will produce<br>
the construction of other proteins. And the neural architecture<br>
has certain "best ways" of dealing with the surrounding environment,<br>
many of which were probably "discovered" and propagated culturally,<br>
possibly even before the rise of language. Sorting out the genetic<br>
from the cultural takes us right into the messiest possible issues<br>
in animal ethology.<br>
 <br>
It's all a jolly mess, and I bet we're going to have a lot of<br>
fun sorting it all out.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; This is a very materialistic view, or perhaps I should say </i><br>
<i> &gt; biologically dependent view.  </i><br>
<p>
I guess I'm a methodological materialist. If something is to be<br>
explained by an information structure, I still want to have some<br>
clue about which atoms encode that information structure. In<br>
most philosophical questions, the atoms that encode the<br>
interesting information structure are in the human nervous system.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; A good deal of knowledge is not dependent upon the biological </i><br>
<i> &gt; entity percieving it.</i><br>
<p>
Well, remember what I was saying about how a posteriori<br>
knowledge can be seen as the fruit of perception by the<br>
organism, and a priori knowledge can be seen as the fruit of<br>
"perception" by the species gene-pool. It's a very odd way to<br>
use the word perception, certainly, and if I restricted myself<br>
only to standard usage, I'd have to agree with you. But given<br>
this genetic-algorithmish semantic extension of the word<br>
"perception" (which is due to evolutionary epistemologists such<br>
as Donald Campbell), I'd want to claim that all knowledge<br>
(actual physically encoded information structures in people's<br>
nervous systems that we use as knowledge) has its causal origins<br>
in "perception" either in the conventional "small" sense or in<br>
the new, unconventional "large" sense.<br>
<p>
I tend to be of the opinion that no knowledge existed at the<br>
time the first replicator spontaneously formed. Knowledge is<br>
what is left over after gross falsehood gets stomped by the<br>
environment. Or at least, that's a hypothesis I entertain from<br>
time to time.  ;)  Here I'm using a rather strict, small,<br>
physicalistic sense of "knowledge" as something that is encoded<br>
within or can be communicated into (as in, reading a book or<br>
something) a physical organism. I know it's odd for me to use<br>
such a restricted sense of the word knowledge when I've just<br>
gone and tried to drastically expand the sense of the word<br>
perception. But if epistemology were a done deal, it wouldn't be<br>
so interesting.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; But biological entities can have a priori knowledge of eternal</i><br>
<i> &gt; truths, eternal throughout our universe, not by genetic intent</i><br>
<i> &gt; (again, I'm not implying a telos) but by the very structure of</i><br>
<i> &gt; their percieving.  In other words, we can have knowledge of eternal</i><br>
<i> &gt; truths by virtue of having the structure that we have, the genes</i><br>
<i> &gt; evolutionary purpose isn't necessarily to enable an understanding</i><br>
<i> &gt; of these truths.</i><br>
<p>
I don't know what the phrase "evolutionary purpose" means. I'm not<br>
saying no such thing exists, I'm just saying I'm unfamiliar with<br>
it. The very structure of our perceiving is a causal consequence<br>
of our ontogenesis. Perhaps I'm being a "causality dogmatist"<br>
here... But purposes, it seems to me, are properties belonging to<br>
the individual organisms that arise within the Big Genetic Algorithm<br>
Soup, not properties of the Soup itself. I really am groping in<br>
the dark here and merely spouting the opinions that get past my<br>
filters, so don't make too much of this.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Indeed, there _must_ be some innate or a priori knowledge, </i><br>
<i> &gt; to enable initial perception.</i><br>
<p>
If you're talking about a human individual's perception, yes.  But<br>
if you're talking about the first physical event of perception in<br>
the cosmos, this doesn't square with our knowledge of biological<br>
evolution. At some point, the first animal perceived something.<br>
The "a priori" knowledge that it had at that time, which enable<br>
its individual perception, lay in the structure of its nervous<br>
system and its sense organs, which grew by an incredibly kludgy<br>
and delightful process from its genes and its encounters with its<br>
environment during its growth. Its genes evolved by a process of<br>
random mutation, accurate replication, and selective elimination,<br>
from those of the first (presumably "nonperceiving" in the narrow<br>
sense) replicators.  Again, the whole argument hinges on Campbell<br>
and Waechterhaueser's extension of the word "perception" to mean<br>
something that gene-pools can do to their environment over long<br>
periods of time too, and *not* *only* something that animals can do<br>
to their environment over short timespans.<br>
<p>
To take it further and make the metaphor more concrete, I'd have<br>
to have a lot more programming experience with genetic algorithms.<br>
But to someone trying to make a GA robot that can navigate an<br>
environment using a GA perceptual algorithm (I'm not sure whether<br>
anything like this has been attempted by anyone yet), I suspect<br>
that these ideas would seem quite concrete indeed.<br>
