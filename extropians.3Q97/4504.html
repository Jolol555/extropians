Yes, I think I have experienced this phenomenon first-hand. ;)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;The more people try to solve the aging problem, the</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Answering your question, if someone woke me up to ask me how to play a B</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; chord, I would be upset because that persons disturbed my sleep.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; As some people on this list are disturbed by the massive amount of mail in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; their box every day from people asking the same basics questions, over and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; over.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you want to compare the trouble of replying to a couple of messages</i><br>
<i>&gt; once in a while (which can be a matter of days, weeks or months but no</i><br>
<i>&gt; less than that) with the agony of not being able to sleep? It's two</i><br>
<i>&gt; completely things, the word "disturbed" has two different meanings in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the two sentences.</i><br>
<p>
I am not disturbed, but maybe some who are subscribed to multiple mailing<br>
lists are disturbed by the massive volume of repetitive e-mails they<br>
receive?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; A better example is my aging research,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the more people I can teach about aging, the more people will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; interested and start researching and the more people would try to solve</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the aging problem. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And so you must weigh the advantages of spending your time teaching others</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and spending your time actually doing research.  When you spend too much</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; time teaching others, you have to cut back so you can do more research.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This is all anyone on the list is saying: too much time is being spent on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; answering basic questions(as opposed to more complicated and unanswered</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; question), so people asking these questions are being discouraged in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; favour of going and reading a book.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I saved this reply for later, as a sort of finishing touch, I think that</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the amount of people asking this kind of questions (in the last</i><br>
<i>&gt; week I think that was just me, not too much), you don't have an arguing</i><br>
<i>&gt; base to complain. As I said before, I respect your positions and I shall</i><br>
<i>&gt; ask no more basic questions but I think that if you spent a few minutes</i><br>
<i>&gt; per week answering basic questions that wouldn't do you any harm, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't disturb you and in the end you would convert more persons to</i><br>
<i>&gt; your ideas.</i><br>
<p>
did you like my "start a new list" idea?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I told you "the A chord isn't actually an A, it's a B flat", you would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say I'm wrong.  What if I replied: "I don't believe you, but I don't want</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to read any books on subject... maybe I will eventually get around to it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the mean time, I don't believe you.  It's obvious that the A chord is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually B flat, I don't understand how you can even begin to think it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not."  Wouldn't that make you a little frustrated? (come on, be honest ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes but if you ask 100 guitar player what is an A chord, they will ALL</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; give you the same answer. However, if you ask 100 economists if</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; free-markets are the best solutions, they won't give you the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; answer.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I have yet to have an economics professor or teaching assistant who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; doesn't think a free-market is the best solution.  If you admit you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; haven't read any books on economics, how can you make this statement?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Personally I never had any teacher of economics because I never had to</i><br>
<i>&gt; learn economics in scholastic life but just because I don't read any</i><br>
<i>&gt; books that doesn't mean I don't know anything about it. I read the daily</i><br>
<i>&gt; newspaper, I watch TV, I read books that mention economical issues, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; talk with other persons about economics, I manage my own money, I buy</i><br>
<i>&gt; and sell things, I'm no ignorant and, fortunately, I have the ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt; think based on observations. Just because I don't have a Ph.D. in</i><br>
<i>&gt; economics that doesn't mean I don't have the ability to talk about</i><br>
<i>&gt; economical issues. And I do know economists that don't see free-markets</i><br>
<i>&gt; as the best solution.</i><br>
<p>
References?  Who are these economists and what have they written?  Maybe<br>
you are mistaking economists and political scientists?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Free-markets is not (at least for many people) the best</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; solution, it's not the ultimate truth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; No, but what is?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That is what I would like to find out. I asked my original questions</i><br>
<i>&gt; because I wanted to see if free-markets was a possible solution to many</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the world's problems.</i><br>
<p>
Which problems?<br>
 <br>
If you define your problems, it might be easier to solve them.<br>
<p>
I think the two major world problems are lack of freedom, and lack of<br>
productivity per capita.  If you study economics, you will instantly<br>
realize that the free market maximizes these two things.<br>
<p>
If your world problems are "too much freedom" and "too much productivity",<br>
then the free market is definitely not for you.  I hear there are still<br>
some communist countries accepting new residents ;)<br>
<p>
Also, if you world problem is "not enough equality", then again the free<br>
market is not for you.  If we were all equal, there would be no diversity.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; An A chord is always an A chord</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; and if anyone disagrees on that he is immediately wrong,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think you should go to your local library or even the internet, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; search for the word "epistemology" before you make a statement like that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What makes you so sure?   Why is he "immediately wrong"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Come on, a philosophical discussion now!? You know what I mean. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
nope.<br>
<p>
maybe the currrent A chord is actually out of tune with the original A<br>
chord, or theoretical A chord based on the other chords. hmmm.... that<br>
sounded ugly.  "you know what I mean"? <br>
<p>
how do you know when you have found the "truth"?<br>
<p>
how do you know when someone is "immediately wrong"?<br>
<p>
is it a warm, fuzzy feeling?<br>
<p>
<p>
(sorry to get philosophical on you...but since Science is a philosophy,<br>
you might want to get used to it)<br>
