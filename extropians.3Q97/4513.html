<i>&gt; Long time list members might remember the discussion of IQ and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Flynn effect". The Flynn effect refers to the widely observed</i><br>
<i>&gt; increase in average scores on IQ-type tests during the past several</i><br>
<i>&gt; decades (see abstract below.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The web adress:</i><br>

<i>&gt; points to an article that briefly discusses several possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; explanations for the Flynn effect.</i><br>
<p>
This is a good overview, but I don't think the proposed explanation is<br>
very convincing.  It's not clear to me how television and especially<br>
pictures can be said to enrich the viewing environment.  We see images<br>
every time we open our eyes which are every bit as rich as any picture,<br>
if less artistic.  And we certainly see things move for many hours every<br>
day, so old-fashioned television hardly adds much more stimulation.<br>
I could see the case with video games, but those are hardly more than<br>
a decade old.  Did we really think that young people were better at<br>
watching TV than grandpa?<br>
<p>
Even if TV could add stimulation, it only became popular in the 1950s, and<br>
the effect appears to go back at least to the 1930s or so.  I really can't<br>
buy the claim that people putting more pictures on the wall back then made<br>
a difference.<br>
<p>
Here are a couple of postings I made to the list when we first discussed<br>
this.  The first one was meant to be flippant but comes off a bit snide,<br>
I'm afraid.  I got carried away by my excitement at the discovery and its<br>
potential implications.  I have some other postings by other people on<br>
the topic, including Ian Goddard (who attributes it to Rupert Sheldrake's<br>
morphic resonance!), Robin Hanson, Marvin Minsky (who suggests family<br>
size changes), and Hara Ra, who produced an explanation in terms of<br>
sensory stimulation rather similar to that in the referenced article.<br>
