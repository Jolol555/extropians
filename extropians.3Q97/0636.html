Well, what about our culture since the Sixties, for a (not very<br>
rigorous!) kick off?  For example, I remember reading somewhere that the<br>
guy who thought up the idea of shareware (or was the first to put the<br>
idea into action?) got the idea while tripping!  Most computer nerds are<br>
at least stoners, are they not?  I bet you Gates and Jobs had a spliff<br>
or two in their day.<br>
<p>
Come to think of it, culture since the Sixties has been a veritable hot<br>
house of memes!  Another possible (and quite amusing) example: hands up<br>
any libertarians here who read Rand while stoned or tripping during the<br>
Sixties and really 'got it' (I mean really got what she had to offer<br>
that was good, without being sucked into her, as a recent ng correspondent<br>
of mine called it, 'glassy-eyed idealism')? There must have been a lot of<br>
those!<br>
