An excellent point.  Actually, if I may quibble, the 'secretary' role as<br>
we<br>
have thought of it over the last hundred years (post-typewriter) combined<br>
two jobs that were previously of substantially different nature: the<br>
secretary and the scrivener.  The 'secret'ary (pre-typewriter) was<br>
literally<br>
someone who was allowed access to the boss's secrets.  They were what we<br>
would today call an aide or assistant.  (Hence the title 'Secretary of the<br>
Treasury', etc.)  The scrivener was someone responsible for taking<br>
dictation, copying the boss's documents in nice handwriting, and making<br>
hand-copies if that was necessary.  The advent of the typewriter improved<br>
the efficiency of scrivening so much that it could be folded into the<br>
secretary job.  <br>
<p>
Scrivener was very much a lower-status job than secretary; when they got<br>
amalgamated the resulting job was still low-status, but it got the<br>
high-status name.  Now that the scrivener/typewriter job has been entirely<br>
taken over by machines, the remainder of the secretary job has been<br>
renamed<br>
'assistant' and has increased in status.<br>
<p>
I wonder what other jobs will have their drudgery automated away and will<br>
thus both decrease in number and increase in status?  Bank tellers?  <br>

To Carl and other fellow Extropians,<br>
<p>
There is far more to whay you are saying than you express.<br>
What you say, however, is well said.<br>
Interesting thought -- and worth pondering and expanding upon in the<br>
greater social context.<br>
<p>
Enjoy!!!<br>
