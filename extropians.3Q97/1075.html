<i>&gt;This is pretty hard to swallow (as it were).  There are scarabs everywhere.</i><br>
<i>&gt; *Macrocopris symbioticus*, according to the E.B., `lives in the anus of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the wallaby'.  *That's* specialisation for you - it reminds me strongly of</i><br>
<i>&gt;certain academics I've known - and not the kind of thing that evolves in</i><br>
<i>&gt;200 years...</i><br>
<p>
I think we are well out on a limb in regard to this list's focus, but just<br>
to be accurate dung beetles were released in Australia by CSIRO to deal<br>
with the millions of cow pats. The result was a huge success and its good<br>
to see a positive introduction of a species to Australia after all the<br>
negative ones (e.g. rabbit, fox, cat, buffulo, pig). Another useful<br>
introduction of a species was type of month introduced as a natural<br>
predator for prickly pear (another introduced species that went out of<br>
control once it was introduced).<br>
