I'm sorry, Pearson.  I probably shouldn't have said that.<br>
But please, PLEASE stop the lighthearted references to the Holocaust.  I<br>
visited the Holocaust Museum less than a month ago and I can't take this. <br>
Your casual comparisions are a thousand times more obscene than any swear<br>
words that ever existed.  Swear words are nothing, violated taboos that make<br>
people uncomfortable and can be used for shock value.  That is *nothing*.  The<br>
Holocaust is obscene.<br>
<p>
I'm sorry if I took out my anger on you, but it feels like you're mocking the<br>
memory of something horrible beyond description.  You were being more obscene<br>
than any oath in history, and you didn't even know it.<br>
<p>
That still doesn't excuse me trespassing whatever uncodified bounds of<br>
civility everybody thinks we're obeying.  So I apologize.<br>
<p>
But STOP it!  At least don't put it into the subject lines so I have to read<br>
it over and over!  However angry I got, I would never have sworn in the<br>
subject line!<br>

<p>
I still can't write that or read it without tears coming to my eyes.<br>
<p>
Please stop the Holocaust references.  PLEASE.<br>
