<i>&gt; &gt; "Money" is nothing more than an agreement among individuals to abstract</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; some valuable for convenience of trade.  Those who oppose the idea are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; just being stubbornly anti-social.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anybody who wants to continue using 'money' could do so under my new system,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which is a superset of the old.  More possibilities, not less.  Complex barter</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't have to be mandatory, just possible.  The situation for holdouts would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be loosely analogous to someone in our current society refusing to use money. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Holdouts will lose (money)/(resources) until they give up and join in.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not saying that complex barter is necessary for the common good, although</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is.  I'm saying that complex barter is as much an improvement over money,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as money is over simple barter.</i><br>
<p>
I can see the attraction of a system such as you propose, but even if we<br>
assume that you can make the transaction costs and accounting costs of<br>
a complex barter system so small that instantly trading any commodity<br>
is trivial, it's still not as useful as some forms of money.  For example,<br>
in your economy, there will be data somewhere on "things I want" and<br>
"things I have to trade".  What happens when I'm asleep?  Those things I<br>
have to trade are productive assets even in my absence, so I will likely<br>
contract with some other entity to trade them on my behalf so that I get<br>
maximum benefit.  I'll want to pick a trading proxy business (let's call<br>
it a "bank") that is most effective at producing more of what I want<br>
from what I have, and it needs some unit of measurement for its ads,<br>
because everyone wants different things.  Some common bartered item may<br>
serve adequately, but technology changes; yesterday's precious gems are<br>
tomorrows cheaply-manufactured diamondoid.  If I want to borrow some<br>
things from that bank because I have an interesting business idea, they<br>
will want me to pay them back with whatever they want /at the time of my<br>
repayment/, not at the time of the loan, so they'll have to contract for<br>
some measure of worth that won't risk being devalued by technological<br>
changes.  They'll probably issue their own "currency", which is just a<br>
promise that all dealings with this bank will be measured by these units<br>
whose value depends only on the reputation of the bank.  They may want to<br>
back it with named commodity bundles, but it would be even safer if it<br>
were backed by contracts that specified commodities and services with<br>
contingencies for technological change, or methods by which members<br>
can revalue it by later agreement.<br>
<p>
"Money" that is explicitly decoupled from actual valuable things--that is<br>
nothing but a relative measure of worth among traders who agree to use<br>
it for that purpose--is just too convenient for making long-term deals,<br>
financial deals with no specific commodities involved, and other free-<br>
trade uses, that I do not see even your instant-complex-barter being as<br>
useful or as productive.<br>
