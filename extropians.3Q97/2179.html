It really was from me, Robin Hanson.<br>

<p>
Huh?  If one has "obvious sexiness", then one is likely is demand.<br>
And one can easily be very frustrated if unable to participate for<br>
whatever reason.<br>

I meant "markets" to include non-monetary exchanges, such as in the <br>
"marriage market".<br>

<p>
Yes of course.  And if most people were physically starving, I<br>
wouldn't feel uncomfortable with talk of nutrition, and how to grow,<br>
transport, and preserve basic foodstuff.  <br>
<p>
I agree here with Steve who said:<br>
<i>&gt;things like embarrassment, rejection, disease, alienation,</i><br>
<i>&gt;psychological warfare within couples ...  If people talk about</i><br>
<i>&gt;variations on those things, I (e.g.) might overcome my squeemishness</i><br>
<i>&gt;and pay attention.</i><br>
