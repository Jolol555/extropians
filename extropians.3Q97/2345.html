     Tony Hollick requested:<br>
     <br>
     Rick, kindly cease from using provocative language: 'flame wars' are<br>
     'not on' hereabouts; and when I 'flame' people, they _burn_.  OK?<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     Rather than address this in a private e-mail, let me first say that it <br>
     wasn't my intention to start a flame war although your posts as a rule <br>
     do tend to find me patting my pockets for a lighter.  And speaking of <br>
     "lighter", please lighten up.  This is a digest of *ideas* and if you <br>
     don't like the ones I express, try to look at the source of that <br>
     dissatisfaction rather than as some guy (me) as your perceived enemy <br>
     which is *flaming* you in some personally damaging way.  <br>
     <br>
     A veiled threat such as your last statement prompts me to keep this <br>
     discussion public because if my credit goes whacko all of a sudden, <br>
     I'd like an audit trail of where that dysfunction may have originated. <br>
      <br>
     The moral of the story is that it is unwise to threaten people without <br>
     just cause.  It causes them to be defensive unnecessarily.  The verb <br>
     "burn" in conjunction with human beings is usually regarded as a bad <br>
     thing.  Unless I am to assume you are limiting your countermeasure to <br>
     verbal assaults (which I don't publically respond to and I have a very <br>
     thick skin), your response was inappropriate because the only thing I <br>
     might've said that could be remotely interpreted as hostile was to <br>
     refer to your post as a "rant".<br>
     <br>
     As for a response to your questions about the mating rituals of <br>
     American teachers and their students, Sarah pretty much covered the <br>
     topic adequately for me.  Thanks Sarah.  <br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
