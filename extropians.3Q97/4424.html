Oh, dear, yes, it is to laugh.  There seems to be a deeply embedded program<br>
in the brain that ensures that when we comment on the spelling or<br>
grammatical oddities perpetrated by other people we commit one of our own.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; many less educated English speakers</i><br>

<p>
In fact, the propositional structure of English and indeed every natural<br>
language is so flexible and open to arbitrary fashion that the real `error'<br>
or solecism in using `don't know nothing' is its class origins rather than<br>
anything to do with logic.  One is marking oneself as insufficiently<br>
middle-class, in reality or aspiration.  I suppose anarchists ought to be<br>
opposed to such controlling impositions.  On the other hand, normative<br>
English is deeply pleasurable for those of us who have spent many years<br>
learning its quirks and subtleties.  So, despite Steven Pinker's populist<br>
strictures in THE LANGUAGE INSTINCT, I can't help myself flying into a rage<br>
when Americans say with a shrug, `I could care less' when they plainly mean<br>
to convey that they could *not* care less, that is, that they already care<br>
nothing about the matter in question.  And then there's the errant<br>
apostrophe's that creep into the end's of word's...  Sigh. <br>
