     ...say those whose motto is to "protect and serve".<br>
     <br>
     Hegbard Celine's recounting of his "interference with police business" <br>
     pissed me off so royally.  Those types of situations really get my <br>
     activist ire up and I really need to get in touch with that.  For a <br>
     person who rather simplistically advoicates peace, all it takes for me <br>
     to say "screw that!" is one unreasonable asshole of a cop who, given <br>
     the lack of better psychological profiles that would otherwise screen <br>
     him out of such "service", is instead the one the limited mental <br>
     capacity, the gun, the billy club, the computer and radio and most <br>
     importantly the judicial power to screw up your life, whether for 24 <br>
     hours or 24 years.<br>
     <br>
     When I was speaking of "ego" earlier, I wasn't talking about the lay <br>
     usage.  Ego is a sense of self.  It is the skewed sense of self that <br>
     starts a slow drift towards sociopathy that I was speaking of.  <br>
     <br>
     This cop and his extraordinary lack of judgment exhibited what I <br>
     consider sociopathic tendancies, is not fit to wear a uniform of what <br>
     is euphemistically referred to as a "peace officer".  I wish there was <br>
     a way to realistically get through to people like that but <br>
     unfortunately, right now I can't think of any.  I'm too busy <br>
     fantasizing about a cyber scourge of this man's personal credit <br>
     profile which makes his daily life a real chore &lt;G&gt;.  I knew I <br>
     should've taken Hacking 101.<br>
     <br>
     Breathing deeply and coming back to nominal levels.<br>
     Rick<br>
