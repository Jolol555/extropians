quoth Abraham Moses Genen, evidently not a member of JPFO,<br>
: The claim that many people are being improperly denied the right to<br>
: bear arms seems more than slightly specious. The high court has ruled<br>
: on this issue as well in great detail. They have concluded that the<br>
: right to bear arms is not absolute and can be regulated by the Federal<br>
: government, the States and and political subdivisions thereof.<br>
<p>
Have they really?  So much for the myth that the Supreme Court has<br>
for generations avoided hearing any Second Amendment cases.<br>
<p>
Anyway, this element of the challenge to the Brady Act is not on Second <br>
Amendment grounds, but on the ground that the denials are capricious.  The <br>
authority to deny a license does not imply authority to deny it randomly.<br>
<p>
: The need for firearms in our society seem questionable as well in many<br>
: instances.<br>
: The arguements as to the need for self-defense against predators in our<br>
: society is best answered by having professionally trained law enforcement<br>
: officials in each community.<br>
<p>
I thought we had 'em.  They're the guys who broke down my friend's door<br>
and stole his merchandise and his computers (and his wife's gun).<br>
<p>
: I'm a bit dubious as to the need of hunters for many of the rapid fire<br>
: arms that are readily available<br>
<p>
De gustibus non disputandum!<br>
<p>
: as well as the need for handguns. The collected cumulitive evidence<br>
: indicates that most people who claim they need a handgun for self<br>
: defense are usually incapable of using one under siuations of stress.<br>
: They frequently end up shooting other family members or themselves.<br>
<p>
More often, they end up shooting nobody, because the aggressor flees<br>
on seeing the gun.  The professionally trained law enforcement officials <br>
are said to shoot the wrong person about eleven times as often as armed <br>
civilians do.  (I believe this ratio is normalized for total number of <br>
shootings.)  This suggests that delegating the power to shoot badguys <br>
was a bad idea.  If shooters are incompetent, some of the blame must <br>
go to city councils that drive out practice ranges for being icky.<br>
<p>
The claim frequently quoted that "a gun in the home is 43 times more <br>
likely to kill a family member than to kill an intruder" is, even if <br>
accurate, meaningless.  People defending themselves against violent mates <br>
are counted among the 43 -- is it better for husbands to strangle wives<br>
than for wives to shoot husbands?  The vast majority of armed encounters, <br>
in which nobody is killed, are ignored (though surely some would have <br>
been killed if unarmed).<br>
<p>
: It's possible that the issue of paranoia in our society is entering the<br>
: minds of some of you, as well as the numerous psycho-sexual implications<br>
: of gun collecting, so I'll let this issue ride while you digest and<br>
: consider the bigger picture.<br>
<p>
My sex-life is disappointing, and I own a great big pistol.<br>
I deny feeling particularly sexy when I fire it.<br>
<p>
: For those who are sceptical about my motives. Yes, I am an occasional<br>
: casual hunter. Yes, I use a single shot shotgun or a compound bow when<br>
: I hunt. Yes, I've had to use deadly weapons in the distant past. No, I<br>
: did not enjoy having to use them. The circumstances under which I was<br>
: required to use weapons I'll leave to your fertile imaginings.<br>
<p>
Why, don't the circumstances suit your rhetorical point?<br>
