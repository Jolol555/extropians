     There must be some serious cultural differences going on here...<br>
     <br>
     Prof. Gomes writes (and I have rephrased for clarity):<br>
     <br>
     I repeat that the psychological external factor is important and lots <br>
     of blacks will love themselves and their lives more when they can<br>
     make genetic skin-hair-eyes treatment...they already try to<br>
     straighten their hair...<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     Having been raised in the south with parents who were, at least, by <br>
     default, racist and also having to spend most of my life carefully <br>
     deprogramming myself and make the distinctions of whatever inate <br>
     aversion I still have towards certain groups of people (usually <br>
     class-based), it is quite a sensitive issue to hear such gross <br>
     generalization about race.  One such generalization is the assertion <br>
     that people of color "already try to straighten their hair".  Hello?  <br>
     Like we haven't been doing everything under the sun to our looks in <br>
     the predominantly white culture.  The thing is, the cosmetics industry <br>
     has been catering to that majority for much longer.  Only recently <br>
     have people of color had quality personal care products to alter their <br>
     appearance.<br>
     <br>
     The other statement that people of color will love themselves more <br>
     when they can alter their appearance also smacks of some programming.  <br>
     That notion spans the breadth of western culture in all races where <br>
     they don't have to spend each day worrying about survival issues.  If <br>
     those bases are covered, you start worrying about how to get <br>
     prettier/more noticeable/more clout.  (For the genuine geek, that <br>
     means: how to get more gear &lt;G&gt;).<br>
     <br>
     We're programmed to dislike our personal appearance in one capacity or <br>
     another.  Hair texture/color, eye color, skin w/ wrinkles, w/ acne, in <br>
     need of a tan, flat stomach, prominant chest, you name it!  That way, <br>
     a multi-billion dollar industry can keep its wheels spinning at a <br>
     feverish pitch.  <br>
     <br>
     And IF there are people of color who DO dislike themselves and the way <br>
     they look in this culture, it's likely because the majority has spent <br>
     several centuries chanting the mantra of them not being good enough in <br>
     some capacity.  It wouldn't be hard for me to draw the connection <br>
     between the way I looked and the availability of prosperity to the <br>
     group to which I resembled.<br>
     <br>
