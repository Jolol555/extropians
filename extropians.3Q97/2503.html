<p>
"Cool", what a word to describe blowing up the Sun. :)<br>
<p>
About fusing He-3 and N-15 in the core: haven't you just reinvented the<br>
"helium flash", a phase in the normal evolution of stars?  My<br>
recollection<br>
is that according to the accepted models of solar evolution there is a<br>
very brief phase when all the He-3 that accumulates in the core during<br>
the H-burning phase ignites, and the fusion rate goes as temperature to<br>
some obscene power, that's why they call it a "flash".  I'm a bit<br>
suspicious of your estimate of the time required for the sphere to reach <br>
the core, because the effect of the helium flash is supposed to<br>
propagate<br>
to the surface for thousands of years (i.e. nothing spectacular can be<br>
seen on the surface).  I understand that you're hoping to keep the bomb<br>
in solid state all the way, but so many orders of magnitude still make<br>
me<br>
nervous...  Also, even if it does reach the core and ignites, the output<br>
is still gaseous and has to travel upwards for ages.  (Unless you can <br>
collect neutrinos, of course.  :)<br>
