Pretty much the view I take in THE SPIKE.  After a while, if the minting<br>
(molecular nanotechnology) prospect turns out to be a goer, things will<br>
tend to work themselves out anyway - or blow all to grey hell.  What I<br>
didn't really address in the book, except by continue-sort-of-as-things-are<br>
implication, is how today's wealth might be potlatched in the least<br>
offensive manner.  Most people on this list clearly detest the idea of The<br>
Man taking and distributing a share of the community's productivity, but is<br>
there another way than an IRS to create and maintain a Guaranteed Income<br>
floor (which I recommend in the book, on the same grounds as Mr Willow)?<br>
Once it's in place, of course, there's the possibility of removing a lot of<br>
bureaucratic busybodying and logjamming and like that...<br>
