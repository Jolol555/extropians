Please pardon if I missinterpret you, but you seem to be giving individual<br>
consumers an unrealistic say in the out come of an unregulated economy.<br>
An unregulated system will behave on its own according to its own<br>
specifications, not by will of any given agent.  Of course all agents<br>
contribute to that behavior,  but when interacting with 100 millions or<br>
billions of other agents, the interactions can produce behaviors that have<br>
nothing in common with the intentions of the actions that produced them.<br>
The choices I freely make do not translate to a one to one correspondence<br>
between what I want the economy to do, and what kind of behaviors I end up<br>
contributing to.  There is too much interaction and feedback in the<br>
system.  If I buy products from an upstart hoping they will prosper and<br>
brinng me more self-enhancing tools, the opposite could happen.  Many<br>
other consumers who feel the same as me may give the suits of that firm<br>
reckless confidenc and cause them to ride a wave of inflated growth right<br>
into the ground.  (Woops.  When does Win98 come out?)  I do not mean to<br>
suggest that there should be state intervention, only that people aren't<br>
necessarily gonna get what the bargained for in a free economy.  People<br>
will have to have to adapt and be prepared for unfavorable conditions,<br>
however ones that are not enforced at gun point.  Imagine that...<br>
