Lisa asks Lachele:<br>
: As an anarchist, do you stay outside of<br>
: the society which is governed by our Constitution, or do you live in our<br>
: society but choose not to abide by the laws?  Or is your anarchy one of<br>
: philosophical belief and you do neither?  Or other?  I am curious.<br>
<p>
Our society is NOT "governed by our Constitution".  If it were,<br>
countries that copied their constitutions from ours would be culturally<br>
indistinguishable; they're not.  I think the people who ratified it<br>
would be horrified at the suggestion that a single brief document could<br>
define the essence of a society.  Limited government is another way of<br>
saying that MOST of society is and/or ought to be beyond the scope of<br>
the state's influence.<br>
<p>
In a sane society, most of what goes on can't be distinguished from<br>
anarchy.  We buy and sell, we love, we read and write - most of the<br>
time, the laws are (or ought to be) irrelevant to these activities.<br>
<p>
What does it mean to live as an anarchist in a state-ridden world?<br>
First of all, it means not to cooperate willingly with the state's<br>
arbitrary demands.  We don't help the cops against tax-dodgers,<br>
draft-dodgers, pot-smokers, wetbacks.  We don't volunteer private <br>
information to every noseyparker who feels entitled to it.  We <br>
don't mention "sales tax" at the flea market.  We don't vote to <br>
subsidize a new stadium for the Giants or the 49ers.  We don't <br>
apply for permits to exercise our natural right of self-defense.  <br>
We obey the prohibition of murder, theft, fraud-- but we'd do that <br>
anyway.  Among consenting adults, we make our own rules.<br>
<p>
It's impossible - some say by design - to obey all the laws.  <br>
So we try to behave ethically, and not get caught.  In that,<br>
we anarchists aren't much different from most of our neighbors,<br>
we're just more philosophical (read:wordy) about it.<br>
