[This message is actually not about drugs in spite of the opener.]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From: "Bobby Whalen" &lt;organix@hotmail.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On Sun, 20 Jul 1997 Geoff Smith wrties:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If psilocybin unlocks the power of 90% of our brain, why do we not see an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;academic elite of psychedelic drug-users? (not to suggest that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;there aren't any brilliant psychedelic drug-users!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Becasue its illegal!</i><br>
<p>
That wouldn't stop most of us. Hell, you can buy any sort of "illegal"<br>
drug you want on the free ("black" is a dirty word) market.<br>
<p>
The fact is that psychedelic drugs are (at very best) an aid to<br>
self-exploration, and have no other impact. They certainly don't open<br>
up some magical way to be far smarter than you already are.<br>
<p>
However, that's not what I'm here to post about.<br>
<p>
What I find really disturbing about this discussion is that we are<br>
having it at all.  Half the people posting here are, quite frankly,<br>
about as critical in their thinking as trepanned chihuahuas. This is<br>
not the Extropians list of yore, where polymaths gathered to swap<br>
INFORMED discussion.<br>
<p>
Danny (&lt;CALYX@aol.com&gt;) and the rest are astounding to me. The<br>
amount of junk they can post ("earth's polarity is going to reverse!<br>
drugs are the way to observe other physical dimensions! 50 pounds of<br>
raw meat are lodged in your stomach RIGHT NOW!") doesn't seem to have<br>
much of a bound. Stuff that wouldn't make it past the bullshit<br>
detector of a kid with high school chemistry, biology and physics is<br>
posted as though it were something worth discussing.<br>
<p>
Yes, I'm an elitist of sorts. I'd rather hear Carl Feynman woolgather<br>
about ways to build craft to explore the Sun's atmosphere than hear<br>
the empty-headed wannabes mumble along. Why? Because Carl is a better<br>
thinker and his speculations are thus far more interesting to read,<br>
that's why. I'd say that Carl is, in fact, "better" than "Danny", at<br>
least at informed speculation on scientific topics of interest to me.<br>
<p>
(And no, I wouldn't mind at all if the fuzzy-headed crowd felt<br>
insulted and left. In fact, I highly encourage them to do so.)<br>
