Damien Sullivan reports<br>
: Jacobs, in _The Economy of Cities_ plausibly reversed the usual<br>
: development process -- small trading cities developed first,<br>
: near unusual raw materials (obsidian, perhaps) and agriculture<br>
: and animal husbandry began by accident, due to the diversity and<br>
: large number of seeds and tamed animals brought in for trade.<br>
<p>
This is compatible with someone's suggestion (did I read it here?)<br>
that our ancestors' love of art was what did in poor old Neander.<br>
To recap: We have lots of Neanderthaler artifacts but they're all<br>
purely functional, nothing ornamental.  With low technology, there's<br>
little worth trading other than artwork, because apart from that<br>
everyone has pretty much the same stuff.  So the heavy-brow guys<br>
didn't trade, and so had no wide-range society; they might not even<br>
share language with neighboring bands.  That's a serious competitive<br>
disadvantage against folks whose favorite thing to do, when they<br>
meet strangers, is to ask "What's new and have you got anything<br>
pretty?"<br>
