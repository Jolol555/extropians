     Thanks Dan Fabulich for taking this request on.  I have one more <br>
     request and a confession to go with it and it sheds some light for me <br>
     on what may agenda may actually be...<br>
     <br>
     First, the request is that we separate the issues so that the thread <br>
     doesn't become congested with long posts with quotes within quotes.  <br>
     Also, when one is referring one to a URL, a brief (even one sentence) <br>
     synopsis of what the investigation may entail would be appreciated.<br>
     <br>
     Secondly, pleading "guilty" to my attraction toward intrigue, the <br>
     dramatic and the emotionally rippling threads of late.  My version of <br>
     a soap or a talk show one might say.  Doesn't get much done unless it <br>
     ultimately leads one to the conclusion that there is work to be done <br>
     and one must actively participate in it.<br>
     <br>
     My request, when seen in the light of my attraction towards drama, is <br>
     thus, a request to temporarily assist a mental handicap as I further <br>
     make the distinction between yattering and mattering.<br>
     <br>
     Peace<br>
     Rick<br>
