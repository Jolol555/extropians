<i>&gt;Saying that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the medical profession has a vested interest in preserving the</i><br>
<i>&gt;current state is a bit imprecise; &lt;snip&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;the society in general that opposes changes, the medical profession</i><br>
<i>&gt;is just the part which relates to this problem (sex change). So to</i><br>
<i>&gt;really deal with the problem we have to deal with social attitudes. </i><br>
<p>
Under your model, I suppose that follows, but I utilize Judith Lorber's <br>
paradigm of gender as a social institution in itself, a product of human <br>
invention adopted for its usefulness in allocating societal <br>
benefits and responsibilities.  The maintenance of constructed gender <br>
differences underlies most other societal institutions, most of which <br>
are constructed along the differentials in varying ways.<br>
<p>
Because gender-bending of any sort reveals the artificial<br>
constructions and learned behaviors that constitute the institution <br>
of gender, (however constructed in whatever society) it would <br>
therefore be in the best interest of all other societal institutions <br>
to constrain that behavior, to control who has access to it, to <br>
determine how much to marginalize or integrate it.  The medical <br>
profession, as part of both the social institutions of community <br>
service and academia, has developed its own methods to accomplish <br>
this.  <br>
