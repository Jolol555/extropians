&lt;&lt; That machine seemed very cool to me too. I asked the director of my health<br>
 center about it or anything like it, and she said that she goes to all the<br>
 conventions and seminars and so forth and has never seen anything like it.<br>
 But I decided I wanted to get it anyway and tried to find their website. It<br>
 didn't exist under anything like the name they mentioned, so I gave up on<br>
 it. But I look forward to a "flying" machine like this becoming available.<br>

Finally got to an internet plugin site....I've been able to discover some<br>
info...if you're interested...<br>

This is what I've come up with in the last few hrs....by themselves they're<br>
probably just another "infor-mercial" money-eater....but coupled with a VR<br>
set-up?  <br>
<p>
 Well....one day (soon?) I'd like to try it.<br>
