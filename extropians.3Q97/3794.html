Well, he wrote a VERY complex post, exactly the kind of response I was looking<br>
for.  I'm not quite sure I understood it.  I hope he will not hesitate to<br>
correct me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can see the attraction of a system such as you propose, but even if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; assume that you can make the transaction costs and accounting costs of</i><br>
<i>&gt; a complex barter system so small that instantly trading any commodity</i><br>
<i>&gt; is trivial, it's still not as useful as some forms of money.</i><br>
<p>
Money, here, is... what?  Not the government-issued green stuff, I assume.  A<br>
universal standard of exchange?  Somebody accepting, up front, something they<br>
don't need because they know they can trade it for something else, as opposed<br>
to running a hidden cyclic debt cancellation through the barter nexus?<br>
<p>
Well, I don't need any gold.  So if I (explicitly) trade X for gold, hold that<br>
gold, and trade the gold for Y - instead of trading X for Y directly with the<br>
gold transaction being hidden - then I suppose that's money.  But I'm still<br>
not quite sure that's what you mean.  Is it a necessary part of something<br>
being "money", the way you use the term, that it have value which is dependent<br>
on it being accepted as a unit of exchange, rather than its intrinsic value to<br>
someone else?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For example,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in your economy, there will be data somewhere on "things I want" and</i><br>
<i>&gt; "things I have to trade".  What happens when I'm asleep?  Those things I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to trade are productive assets even in my absence, so I will likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; contract with some other entity to trade them on my behalf so that I get</i><br>
<i>&gt; maximum benefit.</i><br>
<p>
As near as I can work this out, it means that I should invest in stocks, or<br>
(if I accumulate wealth) keep it in a form that can be used to create<br>
additional wealth, or rented out to others who will do so.  But then what was<br>
the line "there will be data" about?  How does buying and selling link to<br>
wealth accumulation and exponentiation?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'll want to pick a trading proxy business (let's call</i><br>
<i>&gt; it a "bank") that is most effective at producing more of what I want</i><br>
<i>&gt; from what I have, and it needs some unit of measurement for its ads,</i><br>
<i>&gt; because everyone wants different things.  Some common bartered item may</i><br>
<i>&gt; serve adequately, but technology changes; yesterday's precious gems are</i><br>
<i>&gt; tomorrows cheaply-manufactured diamondoid.</i><br>
<p>
Does the 'bank' find me maximally advantageous cyclic debt cancellations?  Or<br>
does it convert permanent wealth into wealth-producing format?  Or is it a<br>
middleman advertising the things I want?<br>
<p>
A brief note about precious gems - what do *I* want precious gems for in a<br>
complex barter economy?  They just sit around and do nothing!  If I want to<br>
wear them, then they're just as valuable *to* *me* regardless of what someone<br>
else is willing to pay for them, whether $10,000 (gems) or $5 (diamondoid). <br>
Maybe the fashion value will fluctuate, but such losses are part of fashion -<br>
whether you use money or barter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I want to borrow some</i><br>
<i>&gt; things from that bank because I have an interesting business idea, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; will want me to pay them back with whatever they want /at the time of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; repayment/, not at the time of the loan, so they'll have to contract for</i><br>
<i>&gt; some measure of worth that won't risk being devalued by technological</i><br>
<i>&gt; changes.</i><br>
<p>
The bank wants marble columns for their front, food for their employees (or,<br>
the cooperators forming the bank want food), programs for their computers,<br>
advertising space for their offers.  The advertisers want computer programs to<br>
track viewers.  The farmers want computer games to play.  The marble<br>
manufacturers also want computer software, or at least their employees do.  A<br>
complex barter contract could take place with any of these.  Admittedly, the<br>
problem of "loans" is not one I had considered.  I might get back to you on<br>
this one, because I'm not sure offhand how it would be handled.<br>
<p>
Maybe the problem is the existence of the 'bank' as a separate entity instead<br>
of a middleman.  The 'bank' acts as middleman for a farmer with surplus food,<br>
an advertiser with available space, and a landlord with office space, all of<br>
whom are willing to 'risk' their wealth, fractionated into 70 different<br>
business ventures, each with a 500% payoff and a 25% chance of failure. <br>
Alternatively, even if the landlord isn't willing to risk something, another<br>
person might trade for the space.  All of these people get paid off in<br>
whatever you produce at profit time, be it hamburgers or widgets, which they<br>
can then trade for whatever else they want.  If what you produce isn't<br>
profitable, then they lose their investment.<br>
<p>
This is just how it works now, in the sense that each failed loan decreases<br>
the interest on your account by a bit (or would if not for the buffer of the<br>
bank's profits, which insulates you from immediate fluctuations - but return<br>
on investment still determines the payable interest eventually).  And if all<br>
the bank loans fail, you lose whatever portion of your income the bank had invested.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They'll probably issue their own "currency", which is just a</i><br>
<i>&gt; promise that all dealings with this bank will be measured by these units</i><br>
<i>&gt; whose value depends only on the reputation of the bank.</i><br>
<p>
I sign a contract that says:  "If I give you 50 widgets to invest, and then I<br>
want them back, then you don't have to give me back 50 widgets, but however<br>
many widgets can be bought with the gold you bought with the original 50<br>
widgets."  Or suitably modified to account for returns on investment.<br>
<p>
With complex barter and complex investment, the contract would be for whatever<br>
I actually "invested" in someone.  Whether I sold the widgets and invested<br>
software, or invested widgets directly, I would still get back my contracted<br>
share of whatever the company produced.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They may want to</i><br>
<i>&gt; back it with named commodity bundles, but it would be even safer if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; were backed by contracts that specified commodities and services with</i><br>
<i>&gt; contingencies for technological change, or methods by which members</i><br>
<i>&gt; can revalue it by later agreement.</i><br>
<p>
At this point our realities have diverged too far for me to respond.  This<br>
bank is too centralized; CB (complex barter) investment may be<br>
controlled/advised from a centralized agency, but it is still distributed in<br>
terms of debt cancellation.  If you start bottlenecking everything through one<br>
institution, of course you're going to start needing money.  That is *exactly*<br>
the problem!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Money" that is explicitly decoupled from actual valuable things--that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing but a relative measure of worth among traders who agree to use</i><br>
<i>&gt; it for that purpose--is just too convenient for making long-term deals,</i><br>
<i>&gt; financial deals with no specific commodities involved, and other free-</i><br>
<i>&gt; trade uses, that I do not see even your instant-complex-barter being as</i><br>
<i>&gt; useful or as productive.</i><br>
<p>
Money is also decoupled from reality.  Which institutions will survive and<br>
prosper; the ones that actually invest X to produce Y, or the ones that take<br>
your money and promise you a 7% return?  At some point somebody has to use<br>
your widgets, or something you traded your widgets for, to produce additional<br>
wealth.  If widgets can't be used to produce wealth, then investing widgets<br>
will not produce a 7% return.  If widgets can be used to make hamburgers, why<br>
the whole fuss about units of exchange?  Send the guy widgets and trade your<br>
hamburgers to a doctor for medical care!<br>
<p>
As far as I can tell, what you're saying is:  "Well, if you abstract away the<br>
process of creating wealth into investing in a 'bank' and getting 7% back,<br>
then you need money."  But why abstract the process of wealth creation, with<br>
attendant inefficiency and information loss?  Getting *away* from that is what<br>
complex barter is all about!<br>
