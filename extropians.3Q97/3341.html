I like to believe that this is a question of where you put your priorities.<br>
Individuals can choose their place in society, (it takes effort, and<br>
realization of the choice) and exercise their influence on that part of<br>
life, which is beyond the control of other individuals. Likewise others<br>
excersise their influence on other parts of life.<br>
 <br>
You can influence the other parts of life by spending resources (not just<br>
money) on individuals or organisations which you believe support your<br>
interests in a certain part of your life which is beyond your direct<br>
control. In a free market solution, the individual decides where those<br>
resources go, rather than having someone (a state) decide it for you. <br>
<p>
The 50% of the gnp that the governement of the Netherlands (your country,<br>
my ex-country) spends for its subjects, may have a more positive influence<br>
on standards of living (for all), when it's left to the individuals to<br>
decide how to spend.      <br>
<p>
Free capitalism doesn't have a solution for everything, i personally<br>
believe it cannot work without an increase in education standards. But i<br>
see how one could trigger the other...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Of course in a true 'Darwinian Economy' optimising use of resources would</i><br>

<p>
I think the main difference between a Darwinian economy and a possible<br>
extropian or transhuman economy is the option for nearly limitless<br>
expansion, that technology offers (more efficient use etc). Where a<br>
Darwininian economy, like Malthus' for instance looks at resources with a<br>
strong limit to their nature, disregarding the human intellect.<br>
         <br>
Also, define a non-productive individual. If you don't look for food, you<br>
don't eat. If you can't find a way to get food yourself, you rely upon<br>
others to provide you with it. (children do, physically and mentally<br>
challenged do, the poor do). <br>
<p>
Who's judgement in reasons for providing someone in need do you trust more<br>
? The judgement of Individuals, or the judgement of a beurocratic, (rusty,<br>
deaf, blind, slow,) system that doen't *feel* it when parting with<br>
resources, when it has to judge the reason to provide others with it ?  <br>
<p>
Also who would eliminate non-productive individuals ? Those who are<br>
receiving benefits today justly, would surely find kind souls to provide<br>
them with resources in a free market society. Those who recieve it<br>
unjustly, would be smart enough to understand that they perish if they<br>
don't become productive. The opinions about justly and unjustly, differ<br>
from individual to individual. Let those individuals share their resources<br>
according to their own ethical values, not forced upon them by a state that<br>
uses the largest part of the money it takes (justified mainly by that<br>
redistribution of wealth, and some sort of mythical nationalist awareness<br>
btw...), for continuing its own inefficient powerstructure.<br>
<p>
The individual needs to take his own responsabilities. To insure ones<br>
security, there are many alternative voluntary ways (insurance companies,<br>
but also labor unions and non-profit organisations). Having a state decide,<br>
is an involuntary way.<br>
<p>
Resources make more resources, when combined with human<br>
information/knowledge/ intellect/technology, and if you extend that, you<br>
can see how this could work for everyone, and every part of society. And<br>
that rusty old powerstructures form more of an obstacle, than a possible<br>
conductor.<br>
