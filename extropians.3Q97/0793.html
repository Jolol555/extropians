Sigh. It seems like I'm constantly frustrated by linguistic problems<br>
of getting my point across in this debate. Well, labor improbus omnia<br>
vincit:<br>
<p>
We grow as humans by our various experiences. Some experiences are<br>
trivial and do not help much (e.g. making my bed this morning), some<br>
are slightly useful (e.g. I just learnt the hard way never to put a<br>
soft drink bottle in the fridge over a weekend), some are important<br>
to us (e.g. driving with my brother I learned this weekend that I<br>
actually *like* the northern swedish countryside) and some are truly<br>
transforming experiences (e.g. understanding and proving my first<br>
geometric theorem). <br>
<p>
Most of these experiences occur more or less by chance - I certainly<br>
didn't plan any of the above experiences except making my bed. Over<br>
our lifetimes we accumulate experience and hopefully develop into<br>
true humans (and transhumans); most of the truly well developed<br>
people I know or have read of have lived long and eventful lives,<br>
with both tragedies and triumphs.<br>
<p>
I don't think it is possible or desirable to remove this accumulation<br>
of experiences into personal growth, but it seems to me that at<br>
present we have not attempted to support it. Some people (IMHO far<br>
too few) seek out experiences since they know they will grow from<br>
them (this was one of the reasons I started with ninjutsu), but we do<br>
not yet have a "science/art of personal growth". This is what I want<br>
to look into.<br>
<p>
For example, I know I'm still fairly young and naive, and that my<br>
view of the world is likely a bit unrealistically positive. While<br>
I can intellectually understand this, it won't change my underlying<br>
mental structures, personality and behavior much. Many people learn<br>
this the hard way: personal disasters rob them of their naivity, and<br>
their over-optimistic views are destroyed by traumatic events;<br>
afterwards there is a complicated struggle to develop a more mature<br>
mental model of the world, which many people fail (becoming depressed<br>
or cynical). Is there really no better way than to experience painful<br>
loss to develop a more mature worldview, a lesson which ought to be<br>
among the earliest for a long lived transhuman? In what ways can we<br>
make the personal growth and maturation process more efficient, less<br>
painful and more transhuman?<br>
