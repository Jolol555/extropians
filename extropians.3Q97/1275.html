Both Church and State seem pretty real to me, unfortunately.<br>

Hmm, perhaps this Wilson fellow isn't such a fool after all.<br>

             <br>
I agree. The Physics of Immortality is a very fine book, but if Tipler had a <br>
good editor who dumped the historical religious mumbo jumbo, the result would <br>
be a great book that was 30% thinner.<br>

<i>        &gt;the proposition asserting the existence of the Mandelbrot set is not </i><br>

             <br>
<p>
In other words the Mandelbrot Set is consistent with the axioms of <br>
mathematics, the axioms themselves have no proof but they just seem so true <br>
they must be, I mean, they're really obvious, as obviously true as the nature <br>
of reality is transparent.<br>
<p>
I talked about consistency because that's as precise and objective a concept <br>
as any known, truth on the other hand is as murky as reality. I also find  <br>
there is very often a disturbing circular element. What is truth? That which <br>
is (exists). What is existence? That which is true.  <br>
<p>
I can't explain what truth is without using the idea of consistency, and <br>
I can't use the verb "to be" either because that implies existence and <br>
existence is what I'm trying to define. All these restrictions are too much <br>
for me, that's why I don't talk about truth.      <br>
