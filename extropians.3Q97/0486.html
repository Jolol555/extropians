No, from this information it's obviously 50%.<br>

Indeed.<br>

<p>
This is an interesting example. As far as I can see it doesn't <br>
involve the Doomsday argument, though. It is just standard induction:<br>
if more people have died than reached the moon, then, ceteris<br>
paribus, Neil shouldn't believe he will reach the moon. Of course,<br>
the cetera weren't paria in this case: he knew that he entered<br>
a space vehicle. This fact outweighs the priors created by induction.<br>
But in the same way, the DA can also be overridden if we have<br>
strong independent reason to believe that mankind will continue<br>
to exist a long time (which we havn't, of course).<br>
