I just received my November Scientific American, and found a fascinating<br>
article about the "Flynn effect" (page 12).  "In the early 1980s, while<br>
studying intelligence testing in the U.S. military, Flynn found that<br>
recruits who were merely average when compared with their contemporaries<br>
were above average when compared with recruites in a previous generation<br>
who had taken exactly the same test....  Flynn found that scores on<br>
virtually every type of IQ test - administered to military recruits and<br>
to students of all ages - had risen roughly three points per decade since<br>
they were first instituted in the U.S.  Flynn learned that 20 other<br>
countries for which sufficient data are available... showed similar<br>
increases.<br>
<p>
"The gains ranged from 10 points per generation, or 30 years, in Sweden<br>
and Denmark to 20 points per generation in Israel and Belgium.  The<br>
upward surges tended to be greatest for tests that minimize cultural or<br>
educational advantages by probing the ability to recognize abstract<br>
patterns or solve other non-verbal problems.  Flynn has recently analyzed<br>
scores from Raven's Progressive Matrices, which is considered to be one<br>
of the least 'culturally loaded' IQ tests.  The birth dates of those<br>
examined span a century, ranging from 1877 to 1977.  Flynn concluded that<br>
someone scoring in the 90th percentile 100 years ago would be in the<br>
fifth percentile today."<br>
<p>
That means that someone who was better on this test than 90% of people a<br>
century ago would be worse than 95% of people today!<br>
<p>
The article goes on to say that elderly people score poorly on IQ tests<br>
not because they've gotten dumber as they get old, but because everyone<br>
did so poorly on those tests when they were young.<br>
<p>
Several explanations are rejected, among them that people today are more<br>
experienced at test taking (fewer people take tests today than in some<br>
past days), that it is a matter of more education (education hours have<br>
fallen in some countries), that television is making people smarter (the<br>
phenomenon long predates television), and that better nutrition and<br>
medicine have improved health (studies have not found much correlation<br>
between nutrition and IQ).<br>
<p>
Flynn himself is apparently too old and hence stupid to believe his own data.<br>
"In fact, he even finds the notion that his generation is significantly<br>
more intelligent than that of his parents ludicrous - and yet that is the<br>
implication of his own research.  'You can see why I'm baffled,' he says<br>
with a sigh."  Well, maybe I am being a bit harsh on him.  Yet I don't<br>
see why the idea is ludicrous.<br>
<p>
I find this result fascinating for several reasons.  First, it is<br>
contrary to the conventional wisdom (hence poor Dr. Flynn's confusion)<br>
and that is always good.  Plus, this particular bit of conventional<br>
wisdom (that people are getting dumber) is particularly pernicious and<br>
anti-extropian.  I would argue that not only are people smarter but they<br>
are wiser and kinder as well.  The whole 20th century is like an<br>
awakening, a realization that the comforting lies of the past will not<br>
fit any more.  Civil rights, Vietnam, feminimism are just the most recent<br>
manifestations of the ethical progress we have seen.  It doesn't surprise<br>
me that people are thinking more these days - they didn't have to do so<br>
back when everything was taken care of for them and everyone knew his place.<br>
<p>
The general interconnectedness of the world has played a part as well,<br>
as has the increasing access to information.  100 years ago a lot of<br>
people were farmers living in little towns and never moving far from<br>
them.  I can just imagine how flustered they would be when faced with<br>
Raven's Progressive Matrices.  Where's the plow?  Those bumpkins were<br>
lucky if they could hold the right end of the pencil.  Today, people<br>
have to be ready for anything.  They are smart, alert, and flexible.<br>
It's not surprising that the occasional farm boy who could outperform<br>
90% of his contemporaries would be left in the dust by young people<br>
today.<br>
<p>
And it makes sense to me that the biggest difference is on the abstract<br>
tests.  Schooling in the old days consisted of rote memorization and<br>
learning of irrelevant data which could only dull the mind.  But they<br>
probably did great on the synonym, math and memory tests.  The abstract<br>
tests would show the least effect from the shorter school hours and<br>
simpler textbooks the schools use today.<br>
<p>
Apparently famous reputed racist Arthur Jensen is going to have a chapter<br>
on the Flynn effect in a new book on IQ.  I hope this phenomenon becomes<br>
more widely known.  In its own way it represents exactly the kind of<br>
thing that I think leads to the effect - a surprising result that is<br>
contrary to the easy and unthinking answers which people were contented<br>
with in the past.  People have to think, faced with this effect.  We've<br>
had a lot of surprises this century, and after a while thinking kind of<br>
gets to be a habit.<br>
<p>
Another interesting question is what the implications are for the future.<br>
Even without smart drugs people may be expected to get smarter in each<br>
generation.  Hopefully this result will deal another blow to the<br>
negativists with their illusions of deterioration.  It is an amazing<br>
effect and I hope we hear a lot more about it.<br>
