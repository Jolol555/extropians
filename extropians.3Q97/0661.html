Rick Knight wrote<br>
: &gt; I rather like Daniel Quinn's classification of "takers" and "leavers",<br>
: &gt; the classic agro-dominant vs. gathering/herding-passive cultures of<br>
: &gt; Earth.  Would a shepherd be a maker or a taker?  Perhaps this is of<br>
: &gt; no relevance to the more forward-thinking extropian mind except to<br>
: &gt; point out the need to define scope in any hard-wired classification<br>
: &gt; exercise. &lt;G&gt;<br>

Michael Lorrey responded<br>
: Such a two class system would describe pre-technological culture just<br>
: fine. When writing, permanent structures, and specialization began to<br>
: occur, the maker category became necessary to symbolize those who built<br>
: newness and were not tied to the wheel of life. THis is why the gods<br>
: were so pissed at Prometheus and stuck him on that rock. ;)<br>
<p>
In other news, Jane Jacobs' book SYSTEMS OF SURVIVAL (1993?) sets forth<br>
the idea that there are two ways to make a living: taking (from Nature<br>
or from other naked apes) and trading (with other naked apes), and that<br>
these two modes give rise to two strongly contrasting "moral syndromes"...<br>
Check it out.<br>
