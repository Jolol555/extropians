In a message dated 97-08-25 10:46:32 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Rant finished (for now). I hope y'all have a somewhat better understanding<br>
 of<br>
 my point of view after this. I still like Holland though, just hate the<br>
 political/<br>
 justice system. I've heard some countries want to copy our "model". My<br>
 advice:<br>
 *don't*. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I...I...don't know what to say..   But I'll say it anyway.<br>
<p>
This is all news to me ...but it really comes as no suprise...I mean...trends<br>
are trends...you guys are just a little bit further along the curve than we<br>
are.  Your turks and morrocans are our mexicans and assorted latinos..<br>
 except we've got a reserve of inner citty welfare already built up..<br>
<p>
The gun issue is no suprise...the areas in the US with the toughest<br>
guncontrol have the highest crime rates....DUH!<br>
<p>
Looks like our problem is government in general...internationally.<br>
<p>
I have a bumper sticker:<br>
<p>
"I love my country...I fear my government"....right next to fit is another<br>
one..." Don't steal..the government hates the competetion"<br>
<p>
Good Luck...we're all gonna need it.<br>
