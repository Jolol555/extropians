<i>        &gt;First off, could you define what this "conscious quantum computer"         </i><br>

         <br>
<p>
I've written several posts on quantum computers, if you can't find them in  <br>
the archives I'll re-post them.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Would the wave function of this event not collapse until I         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;consciously represented the event in my mind  many years in the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;future?  </i><br>
          <br>
<p>
That's the big question, it seems simple but it's extraordinarily difficult, <br>
but perhaps not impossible, to test experimentally. Everett would say that <br>
the  wave function doesn't collapse, the universe splits and consciousness <br>
has nothing to do with Quantum Mechanics. The Copenhagen interpretation says <br>
otherwise.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Can you see the problem I have with all this?          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Certainly, but there is no point in keep asking yourself, can things really  <br>
be this crazy, because the answer is yes.        <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I find such extreme enduring "superimposed states" all very absurd.</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
Well, it is all very absurd, but it's also true. Suppose the two slits are <br>
one light year away, a polarizer set to at 0 over one and 90 degrees over the  <br>
other. One year after they encounter the slits they fall on your film, there <br>
is no interference pattern and it's clear that each photon went through ONE  <br>
and only one slit a year ago. <br>
<p>
Now suppose that after traveling for one year after their encounter with the <br>
slits and one second before they hit the film you suddenly decide to hold up  <br>
a polarizer set to 45 degrees. This erases from the universe all information  <br>
on what photon went through what slit and so you see an interference pattern<br>
and it's clear that each photon went through BOTH slits a year ago.<br>
<p>
Backward causality? Splitting universes? Observer defined reality? I don't  <br>
know, I do know that something  very weird is going on. Bohr said "anybody <br>
who is not shocked by Quantum Mechanics does not understand it" another <br>
fellow said " I think it's safe to say nobody understands Quantum Mechanics" <br>
the fellow's name was Richard Feynman.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Surely any old physical "macro" event, any computer (quantum or not)         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that records and represents the information, or even the information         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;traveling up the optic nerve or a rod or cone neuronn in the retina        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;firring... can do just as much to "collapse" a wave as phenomenal         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;conscious representations can. </i><br>
          <br>
<p>
Maybe so, but it's hard as hell to prove. It's not Everett's fault we need a <br>
conscious computer, Everett says consciousness does not collapse a wave, but <br>
he'd need such a machine to prove it. The reason the computer must be a <br>
quantum one is that as part of the experiment we need to totally erase its <br>
memory at the lowest level and that means the quantum level.<br>
