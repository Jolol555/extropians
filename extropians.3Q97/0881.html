<p>
Most people's conception of what military accuracy is or should be is often<br>
seriously out of sorts with reality and economy.  The old Copperhead<br>
"smart" artillery rounds were about 20% accurate at hitting tanks at<br>
$25,000 a piece.  An equivalent "dumb" round costs ~$500 and on average<br>
requires 500 rounds expended per tank kill (most heavy armor today requires<br>
a direct artillery hit for a kill).  The $500 dumb rounds may sound cheap,<br>
but when multiplied by the number required for the same effect, they<br>
usually cost more.  In a battlefield environment it is absolutely amazing<br>
if you have 50% accuracy.<br>
<p>
But a more important factor is speed.  An artillery battery using "dumb"<br>
rounds requires approximately 30 minutes to fire 500 rounds.  5 "smart"<br>
rounds can be fired in less than a minute.  Since most battles are over in<br>
less than 30 minutes, it is well worth the extra money for the quick<br>
lethality of "smart" weapons.  This is especially true when you are going<br>
head-to-head against similar equipment.<br>
<p>
The 9000 small-arms rounds per kill sounds a little high, but if true<br>
wouldn't surprise me.  Rounds are usually expended for purposes *other*<br>
than killing people.  For example, suppressive fire isn't intended to kill<br>
anyone but uses up a lot of ammo.<br>
