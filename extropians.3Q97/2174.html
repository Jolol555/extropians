     Someone quoted Jodie Foster (er...Ellie Arroway, er...Robert <br>
     Zemeckis?...er,  Carl Sagan???) <br>

     This was one of the most egregious science blunders in<br>
     an otherwise scientifically excellent movie. I turned to<br>
     my daughter as we listened to this an said "the numbers don't<br>
     work!" She already had a grimace on her face.<br>

     Contact is the only film I've seen more than once this summer.  <br>
     Looking forward to seeing some other "blockbusters" for their mindless <br>
     entertainment value, I chose instead to see Contact again...and again <br>
     (just three times, I'm not nuts! &lt;G&gt;).  Anyway, not knowing anything <br>
     about the math or the astronomical accuracy (and personally not <br>
     caring), I still find the statement, regardless of its lack of <br>
     precision, awesome as merely a metaphor.  For what it's worth, I like <br>
     to think it opened up, a little further, the minds of a few people who <br>
     viewed it.  To use the basis of empirical truth against intuitive <br>
     faith was an ideal foundation for this film.  I don't know if it was <br>
     Sagan or Zemeckis or both who crafted the mentality of a child who, <br>
     having lost both parents, looks to the heavens for purpose and <br>
     meaning.  <br>
     <br>
     I remember thinking when she gave that line that "millions" was much <br>
     more than necessary for our purposes.  <br>
