-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>
<p>
So it's come to this, the once mighty Extropian list is reduced to debating <br>
the merits of Velikovsky, that's Velikovsky of the Jupiter spiting out a <br>
comet that causes miracles in the bible and then goes into a remarkably <br>
circular orbit and becomes the planet Venus fame. It's a sad day.<br>
<p>
When Sagan said he predicted the runaway greenhouse effect on Venus in 1960 <br>
he was being modest. 1960 was when his Ph.D thesis was published, he started <br>
writing it in 1957 and made no secret of his views on the subject before that.<br>
Apparently Carl felt that it didn't count until he spelled out every detail<br>
of his argument in great detail and made it available to anyone who wanted<br>
to read it. Most in the Scientific community thought he was wrong until<br>
Mariner 2 proved him correct in 1962. The idea that Carl Sagan could find <br>
anything of value in the ravings of a dim bulb like Velikovsky, let alone <br>
plagiarize it, is beyond idiotic.<br>
<p>
I read the quotation of Robert Anton Wilson that Mark posted, and perhaps<br>
I just have no sense of humor but I didn't think it was very funny. I didn't <br>
find an amusing satire, just a vicious attack by a man ignorant of Science. <br>
Personally I think Bozo The Clown is a better comedian, sometimes he's <br>
amusing when he's hit by a pie and at least his cruelty is not directed at a <br>
good man who did nothing to deserve such shabby treatment. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Mark Grant &lt;mark@unicorn.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>        &gt;perhaps Velikovsky was correct in some respects and wrong in others.</i><br>
                         <br>
<p>
Well, ... his spelling was correct most of the time.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Nuclear winter theory has little to do with the atmosphere and</i><br>
<i>        &gt;everything to do with choice of parameters in atmospheric models. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Obviously part of the art of making a good model is picking the correct<br>
parameters, and Sagan was one of the best in the world at it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;By choosing different parameters you could create anything from a </i><br>
<i>        &gt;'nuclear summer' to a 'nuclear absolute zero'. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Nuclear absolute zero? How?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Sagan was a big supporter of limiting the number of nuclear weapons </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I was too. Something wrong with that?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;when people actually did some experiments to determine the validity </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of the model the parameters were found to be dramatically </i><br>
<i>        &gt;overpessimistic. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Very fortunately the definitive experiment has not been performed, yet. Do<br>
you think that in a matter such as this it would be wise to error on the<br>
side of caution?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The same model predicted millions of dead in Asia after the Iraquis </i><br>
<i>        &gt;ignited the Kuwaiti oil-wells; the real effect was minimal. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's true it didn't work for oil fires, the model failed because the smoke <br>
didn't go as high as most predicted, but that doesn't make Sagan evil or <br>
stupid, just wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;If Dr. Sagan thought there was one chance in a thousand of being </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;correct it was his duty to shout it from the rooftops.</i><br>
       <br>
<i>        &gt;Really? </i><br>
<p>
Yes, really.<br>
       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Should he really have gone out to the mass media </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, really. This was a matter that could effect every person on Earth, not<br>
just Scientists.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;rather than suggesting the possibility to the atmospheric physics </i><br>
<i>        &gt;community for them to review? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
He did BOTH! I challenge you to find one scrap of evidence that he ever<br>
did anything but urge FAR more study about this. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Why was Sagan more concerned with publicity than truth? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Sagan never said he had proven that Nuclear Winter would happen, only that<br>
it was a disturbing possibility that needed further research. I challenge you<br>
to find one case where he even hinted otherwise!<br>
