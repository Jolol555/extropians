Okay, tell me your algorithm for storing all the information describing a<br>
object in one bit, the world needs to know!<br>
                            <br>
<i>&gt;  I can say it, we won't need that level of detail or anything close to it.</i><br>
 <br>

time <br>

<p>
Your physical state is destroyed and replaced for every quantum uncertainty,<br>
and many times when drinking a cup of coffee.  But it isn't physical state<br>
we're trying to preserve, it's consciousness.<br>
                                 <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;at the exact moment you're cloned the two of you start recieving</i><br>
   <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;different input.  You can't occupy the same space, so you can't</i><br>
       <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;share the same input, </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Only the position of your senses is important the position of your brain</i><br>
is <br>
<i>&gt;  irrelevant, unless it's so far away you get a bad time lag due to the</i><br>
speed <br>
<i>&gt;  of light. No reason 2 brains couldn't receive exactly the same input, just</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  put a split on the line.</i><br>
<p>
Since a quantum uncertainty can destroy and replace you, then it can also<br>
change the input between two instances of the same object.  Input goes beyond<br>
your senses, the entire arrangement of the universe and every particle in it<br>
contributes.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;we would have to simulate that input to introduce your</i><br>
consciousness         <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;to your new software existence.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  You could but you wouldn't have to, you could get input from meatspace</i><br>
just  <br>
<i>&gt;  as you do now, and incidentally you and I already have a software</i><br>
existence, <br>
<i>&gt;  but we need new hardware.                                </i><br>
<p>
I agree that we do have a software existence, and that's the basis of my<br>
argument.  The point is, consciousness does not exist as one point in time,<br>
it exists across time.  It is created by past experience and fueled by future<br>
experience, if there exists a lapse in logic between these, (being destroyed<br>
at one point in time and recreated in another place/time, not to mention<br>
another hardware system constitutes as a lapse in logic) then the conscious<br>
thread is terminated.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  In these thought experiments people always look at it from the point of</i><br>
view <br>
<i>&gt;  of the "original", change gears and think about the "impostor" . Suppose I</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  came to you and proved to you that Mr. YakWaxx died last week, I used my  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Nano Robots to  take him apart atom by atom before he knew what hit him,</i><br>
they <br>
<i>&gt;  carefully recorded the position of every atom, then just 5 minutes ago my</i><br>
<i>&gt;  robots used this information to make a "copy" from different atoms that</i><br>
were <br>
<i>&gt;  handy.  Do you think Yakwaxx is really dead, is there any reason to grieve</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  for him? What has been lost? Morally do you think you have any claim to </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Yakwaxx's money and possessions? Would you feel you were suffering</i><br>
unjustly <br>
<i>&gt;  if all your friends and family started to ignore you because you were a </i><br>
<i>&gt;  "stranger"? Is there any logical reason you should be more unhappy now</i><br>
than <br>
<i>&gt;  one minute before I told you? </i><br>
<p>
The "original" is me, it's this instance of me.  Whoever went before me<br>
doesn't matter and doesn't stop that fact that I want to carry on this<br>
perticular instance of me.  You may not care what instances of me you're<br>
dealing with, but I do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  One last question, is there any way you can know that my little story is</i><br>
not <br>
<i>&gt;  true? </i><br>
<p>
It's irrelevant.<br>
