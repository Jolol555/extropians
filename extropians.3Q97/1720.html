[I said:]<br>
<i>        &gt;Switch the legislative branch to an at-large system.  This amounts </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to setting up a 121 (1-to-1 correspondence) between voter and </i><br>
<i>        &gt;congressbeing.</i><br>

[John K. Clark replied:]<br>
[Not in &gt;&gt; because of damn Netscape 4.0.]<br>
"Everybody can't vote for 500 people so somebody would have to decide what<br>
citizen gets to vote for what congress critter, and this is a huge area for<br>
potential monkey business."<br>
<p>
Whoa!  Each person votes for 1 Legislator.  There aren't "races" of two<br>
alternatives; there are 500 alternatives and everybody votes for one.  Let's<br>
say you decide to run for Legislator - then everyone on the ExList could vote<br>
for you, forsaking our previous Legislators.<br>
<p>
"If a dam is built my constituents will get a lot of benefit out of it, but if <br>
I don't vote for it then they get it for free and in gratitude reelect me in<br>
the next election. The constituents of the moron who did vote for it have to<br>
pay for the damn thing and this makes them very unhappy so they vote the<br>
idiot out as soon as they can."<br>
<p>
Exactly!  Except that there are no more "constituents", only people who did<br>
vote for you.  See above.  So nobody ever pays for anything involuntarily;<br>
someone they voted for has to vote to pay for it.  And yes, if a Legislator<br>
votes to build gratis dams for some area, people will vote him out of office. <br>
So no more pork; if something ought to be done, people will pay for it<br>
themselves and invoke the efficiencies of the private government.  The<br>
exception will be if an operation actually needs governmental authority; then<br>
it will have that authority if a majority approves, but will be funded by<br>
exactly the same people.<br>
