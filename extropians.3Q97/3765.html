When I said that hard work sucks and that all attempts should be made<br>
to obliterate it from ones life, I was using it in a very<br>
*context-specific* way. I have no slick clear-cut defintion only a<br>
fast and hard working one. Anything one does willingly and not out of<br>
neccessity or force is not work.<br>
<p>
Hard work is not:<br>
<p>
*Spending 120hrs/week producing Babylon 5.<br>
*Climbing up Mt Fuji.<br>
*Creating a work of art because you felt inspired - even if this meant<br>
carrying 100lb cement bags to make it happpen.<br>
*Running a business that you at least have creative control over.<br>
<p>
I would consider all of these pursuits HARD FUN.<br>
<p>
Hard Work on the other hand, is anything one is forced to do out of<br>
necessity or force, especially if you would rather be doing something<br>
else.<br>
<p>
If someone can provide a more articulated definition, I'm all ears.<br>
