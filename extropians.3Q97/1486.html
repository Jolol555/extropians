<i>&gt; What about a movie version of Sterling's novel</i><br>
<i>&gt; _Schismatrix_...quite a few transhuman notions therein.</i><br>
<p>
Yes. But it would be a *huge* movie, something like Exodus or Dune.<br>
The book stretches over one century of accelerating change - hard to<br>
make a movie of. Although parts certainly would work (unfortunately<br>
it is the lowlife setting of the Zaibatsu in the first chapters that<br>
I think would work best, and that is nearly conventional cyberpunk). <br>
<p>
Chris Behrens &lt;cbehrens@deltav.net&gt;:<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I think the best approach would be something 'ala Atlas Shrugged,</i><br>
<i>&gt; where important people disappear, one by one. Somehow, one of them</i><br>
<i>&gt; slips and reveals their influence in the real world. They are of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course, being uploaded. </i><br>
<p>
Hmm, something like the Copies in Greg Egan's _Permuation City_?<br>
Although these uploads were public and had some PR problems (some of<br>
the rich uploads even tried to improve the image of uploads by<br>
memetic engineering through a sitcom :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At the very end, a newscast plays out, telling the world that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; now-famous hero has disappeared mysteriously... </i><br>
 <br>
Not bad, would likely work as a novel too. Not 100% original, but<br>
workable. <br>

Sorry, your warning is too late. I saw it... it took me several days<br>
to recover. The *only* thing I liked (and I mean it literally) was<br>
the decorations made of mathematical symbols on the bridge in the<br>
dome. The rest was [breaks out in a long and inventive rant about<br>
the lack of creativity in Hollywood]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The best way to get a point across is to ignore black and white, and go for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; nice fuzzy grey.  Several themes have crossed my mind:  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1.  A rebellion against all these 'American President saves the world'</i><br>
<i>&gt; movies.  Instead have a time travelling assassin download himself into</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone's body with the mission of killing the president because of his</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposition to anarchy.  This could lead to a great opportunity of showing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government through the eyes of someone who's seen better.</i><br>
<p>
Fun. But not likely to work well. Maybe it would be better to film _V<br>
for Vendetta_? That novel would certainly work as a film; putting an<br>
anarchist assassin as the protagonist might be too hard to deal with<br>
for most.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2.  Have a couple of people thaw out of cryonic suspension and go on to</i><br>
<i>&gt; explore the wonderful possibilities of the posthuman world.  Keep the</i><br>
<i>&gt; audience in awe of the possibilities and they might not notice the lack of</i><br>
<i>&gt; good vs. evil.  And then, just when they think it's all over interrupt the</i><br>
<i>&gt; credits with scientific news on actually progress towards these possibilities</i><br>
<i>&gt; (You could also throw in a natural disaster, get them all working towards a</i><br>
<i>&gt; goal).</i><br>
<p>
Hard to make interesting - utopias are boring, and a more realistic<br>
posthuman world would be fairly incomprehensible, needing a lot of<br>
tedious explanations. <br>
<p>
Maybe one could run it as a confrontation/contrast between a<br>
posthuman society and mehuman society? In the future there is a<br>
schism between the transhumans and normals, and most of the<br>
transhumans move into space (something like Schismatrix); in time two<br>
different societies develop. The chrononauts awaken to find that the<br>
posthumans in space have sent down a small nanite swarm to awaken<br>
them since their cryonic suspensions will decay in time without<br>
anyone to tend them (and the posthumans might feel grateful to their<br>
forerunners). In doing so the posthumans have actually broken the<br>
rules, and the mehums will be *very* angry if they find out. So the<br>
posthumans can't give them any direct help, but either they will have<br>
to adapt to the mehuman society, or find a way to get into space.<br>
Could be interesting to show the choice between a normal, limited but<br>
basically understandable human existence, and an incomprehensible<br>
posthuman world - some of the people might choose one over the<br>
another, and it is uncertain if anyone is wrong. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Another way of showing transhuman themes in an interesting way is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  look at their human consequences. What about a movie about a family</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  where a daughter is uploaded after an accident, something like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  typical movie where the daughter is handicapped and people struggle</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  to adapt and understand the situation? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not exactly the kind of groundbreaking film to alter the perception of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; world though (which I think is what we're aiming for here).</i><br>
<p>
Hard to do that in one sweep. Few films ever does that (some books<br>
do, however). I think it is a good idea to make transhuman memes leak<br>
into the mainstream, that is where we want them. <br>
