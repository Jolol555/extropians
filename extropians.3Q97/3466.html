What I am interested in is not  bragging that I "know" everything there is to<br>
know about the motives that cause this kind of thinking... we have our<br>
opinions, sure... and some very valid theory about why that stuff is<br>
destructive. Answers are not always the answer. ; )<br>
<p>
Look,  I have long ago labeled all of that  as hogwash and "crap". But my<br>
labeling it does not do one damn bit of good.  People still believe in it.<br>
Everyone is so quick to criticize, but we are back to the compassion issue<br>
again. If people are to change, they need to feel safe and able to listen to<br>
what we have to say. Communication begins with listening and empathizing.<br>
<p>
No one will respond to that blatant denial of other's reality that i have<br>
been harping about. Telling a poor person they are richer than the poor peole<br>
before them denies them their feelings. Deny a person that, they won't hear<br>
you.<br>
( please note: We are not talking about external, immutable raelity. We are<br>
talking about an "internal", imagined, reality-not the natural, physical<br>
mechanical one. Not that it is a good or a bad  thing, but most people enjoy<br>
THAT part of their life experience and have no interst in denying it's<br>
existance.It is our imaginings, filters, feelings, reactions, muse-ings etc.<br>
it very much affects how efficacious we are  the world. Optimism is one such<br>
subjective trait.) <br>
<p>
This is the problem with original Randian objectivism, it tries to negate<br>
that rather than change people's "subjective" experience. No wonder it is<br>
unpopular, only a small percentage of the population wants to live without<br>
that! <br>
Also, IMO,   it condones and rationalizes an outrageous amount of  meanness<br>
and enforces a stubborn passive message: " I cannot, will not, change,<br>
emotionally".  Even more importantly,  I find it boring. It must be repeated<br>
endlessly, because it is a justification. It is not colored with the richness<br>
of life’s most precious gifts. <br>
Perhaps it is nothing but a dangerous and costly mental game, a<br>
self-righteous way to explain and exalt a sad lack of empathy and emotional<br>
depth. Studies show that empathy and an ability to deeply identify with<br>
other’s suffering (compassion) is a "hardwired"  human trait, but  some<br>
people seem to be born without it, or lose it because of neglect or abuse.<br>
 However it is an emotional skill that can be developed with practice. It's<br>
guru suggests we don’t need it, that we are above it. How pathetic an example<br>
of this theory she presents by her life example.<br>
