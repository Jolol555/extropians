No, that is not the question. Not many would say that <br>
consistency guarantees existence (apart from David Lewis). The <br>
snowman is a logically consistent notion but that does not mean that <br>
the snowman exists.<br>
<p>
Now, obviously, if something is asserted to exist by a logically true <br>
proposition, then it exists. So the questions are (1) Is the <br>
proposition that the Mandelbrot exists logically true? (which boils <br>
down to whether the notion of "logical truth" in the traditional <br>
way really makes sense), and (2) Is this kind of existence somehow <br>
fundamentally different from the existence of objects which cannot be <br>
claimed to exist by any logically true proposition.  <br>
<p>

You don't need to accept Russell's theory of types to be a fan of <br>
Logical positivism.<br>

<p>
Sure.<br>
<p>
Now, I don't know whether I basically disagree with you or I am just <br>
playing the devils advocate. But I do think that the question "Does <br>
the Mandelbrot set exist?" needs to be specified and refined. I mean <br>
there is the logical notion of existence, and then the answer is <br>
obviously Yes. But you seem to have a thicker notion of existence in <br>
mind, and until you have explained what that notion is, your question <br>
appears rather meaningless to me. (I mean, if somebody told me "Yes, <br>
the Mandelbrot set does exist.", how much wiser would I be if I <br>
didn't know what this thicker notion of existence is supposed to be?)<br>
