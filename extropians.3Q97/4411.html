<i>&gt; Yes but if you ask 100 guitar player what is an A chord, they will ALL</i><br>
<i>&gt; give you the same answer. However, if you ask 100 economists if</i><br>
<i>&gt; free-markets are the best solutions, they won't give you the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; answer. Free-markets is not (at least for many people) the best</i><br>
<i>&gt; solution, it's not the ultimate truth. An A chord is always an A chord</i><br>
<i>&gt; and if anyone disagrees on that he is immediately wrong, if someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; disagrees with free-markets he is not necessarily wrong. </i><br>
<p>
If you ask /anyone/ such ambiguous, badly-defined questions, you'll<br>
get ambiguous answers.  The question of "best economic system" isn't<br>
even a valid question.  Define your terms and your standard of<br>
measurement, and then you'll get consistent answers.  If you ask<br>
economists something clear, for example "among these X economic<br>
systems (list them) which has historically produced prosperity for<br>
the most people, measured as (state standard of measurement)?"  Then<br>
you'll get pretty consistent answers, even from those who think<br>
your stadard of measurement is the wrong one, or that your list<br>
excludes eir pet idea.<br>
<p>
The free market is not "best" for a large number of possible definitions<br>
of "best"; for example, any definition that includes stability, or<br>
equitability.  None of us argue that; we argue that those definitions<br>
of best are less important than others.  If you want to argue that it<br>
performs badly, then you must specifically define your criteria of<br>
judgment, otherwise, you're not saying anything meaningful.<br>
<p>
My own personal definition has only one criterion: morality. Since the<br>
free market is the only possible just and moral system, the only one that<br>
does not require theft, it is the only one I can support, regardless<br>
of how it performs.  Fortunately, it performs well on other criteria as<br>
well, like general prosperity, and those criteria it performs badly in,<br>
like stability, I don't care about.<br>
