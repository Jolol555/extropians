Sorry you hate mall's (they're a relativly new phenomenon over here so I<br>
guess we're still slightly awed ;-). I was merely indicating the<br>
comfort-level as compared to a Boeing 747.<br>

<p>
I believe there are now plans underway to create an nation-wide subway<br>
system under Switserland (just 'ol fashion drilling, no nano involded).<br>
Once completed passenger and cargo 'trains' could move trough these tunnels<br>
at 400 Km/hr or more. This kind of solution to traffic problems is of<br>
course *very* expensive and could never be afforded by most other country's<br>
(even western ones).<br>
<p>
By the time nanotechnology becomes practical I think the best solution will<br>
be to produce anything as locally as possible, thereby greatly reducing the<br>
need for transport in the first place. Hopefully we wil also have a more<br>
'knowledge oriented' economy (we're moving into that right now) so that<br>
there'll be a lot more 'working where you want' and less obligatory commuting.<br>
<p>
The strong points of airships are (IMHO):<br>
- No new technologies required, can be implemented *today*<br>
- Require little or no ground infrastructure, ideal for developing <br>
  country's and 'neck-of-the-woods-operations'.<br>
- Can handle any size/wheight cargo, as opposed to underground <br>
  tunnelsystems. A complete factory or offshore rigg would pose no <br>
  problem for a large airship.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; A question I have about the lumbering airships. Could they capably </i><br>
<i> &gt; share the airspace with the prop and turbine powered craft already up </i><br>
<i> &gt; there?</i><br>
<p>
This should not be a problem since airships can fly at much lower altitudes<br>
(a typical jet cruises at 30.000 ft). Because of their low-noise propulsion<br>
this should not bother anyone. They could even be made partially<br>
transparant so as not to cause shades in anybody's garden on sunny days ;-)<br>
Also, with a touristic application you might not want to fly in a straight<br>
line but instead follow a coast-line or something like that, quite<br>
different from planes. Besides all that the idea is that they replace at<br>
least some airplanes (lower operating cost, less noise, less pollution...)<br>
