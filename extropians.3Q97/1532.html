Just as in computing there is a tradeoff between what's in RAM and<br>
what's on the<br>
disk, I expect extended external storage with a good interface might<br>
resolve<br>
this concern. I don't expect this can be done with brains as is, and<br>
that some<br>
serious structural modifications are needed. Alternately, the processes<br>
used<br>
for cryonic restoration might allow periodic "sweeping" through the<br>
brain,<br>
relegating less important memories to the external storage, creating<br>
room<br>
for new memories. In AI, this is known as "garbage collection".<br>
