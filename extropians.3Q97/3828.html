     Eliezer stated:<br>
     <br>
     People who study science are artists; people who study art are not.<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight adds:<br>
     <br>
     The key distinction is the verb "study".  Some people are naturally <br>
     inclined towards science and mathematics, some others make music, draw <br>
     pictures, write stories.  Each entails the other.  However, there is <br>
     likely a trait within each type of person that has them flow <br>
     predominantly one way and not the other.  Asimov and Clarke come to <br>
     mind as talented writers with very scientific minds.  They had <br>
     wonderfully imaginative stories steeped in (what some may regard as) <br>
     serious science.  And yet, The Star Wars Trilogy still packs 'em in.<br>
     <br>
     There is no superiority here much as one may attempt to contrive it. <br>
     There is just predisposition of certain gifts and perspectives and a <br>
     interpolation of those diverse talents.  Each shows its vulnerability <br>
     and incompleteness without the influence of the other.<br>
     <br>
     Case in point, from Dr. More:<br>
     <br>
     "I'm disapointed at how few of the [philosophy?] students have any <br>
     background in biology and any comprehension of evolution."<br>
     <br>
     <br>
