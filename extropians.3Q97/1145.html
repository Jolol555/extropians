<i>&gt;This quote says only that gender *is* constructed, which I have not</i><br>
<i>&gt;disputed.  It does not address my question, which is why social</i><br>
<i>&gt;institutions would want to hide the fact of that construction. </i><br>
<p>
I would not say that they 'want' to hide the fact of the <br>
construction, I would say that it runs contrary to the interests of <br>
social institutions to reveal the mechanics of their own <br>
constructions to the individuals that are affected by them.  Every <br>
social institution develops its own methods of ascribing status and <br>
responsibility, with attendant mechanisms for reprimanding or ousting <br>
those who do not comply.  Iconoclastic individuals can be dealt with <br>
through ouster, marginalization, violence, or education.  <br>
<p>
Lorber posits gender as a social institution;  by extension, utilizing <br>
the writing of Bornstein and others on trangressive acts, I can say that <br>
a gender-bending individual, in revealing the constructed nature of <br>
gender to others around them, will provoke enforcement reactions from <br>
those fully conditioned into the norms and rules of any social <br>
institution that intersects with the social institution of gender.  <br>
The individuals may not conciously realize the source of their anger <br>
or negative reaction, and they may believe that they have been <br>
wronged in some manner.  The personalization of their feelings masks <br>
their status as an agent of the social institutions within which they <br>
live.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
