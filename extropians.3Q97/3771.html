Hi!<br>

I find that hard to believe but carry on.<br>
 <br>

Less would be best, it's better 19 years or the high of sexual<br>
performance (for men, for women I would have to think about it). BTW,<br>
I'm 19, see the smile in my face?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How to do this : use cell-repair-machines as described by the molecular</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotechnology concept. These machines should be able to repair all</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible molecular damage created by aging (or deseases), by deducting </i><br>
<i>&gt; the original structure from the damaged structure left.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Damaged DNA can be repaired by comparing the DNA of several different </i><br>
<i>&gt; neighbouring cells. Crossbonds can be repaired if detected. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Damaged proteines can be repaired because the cell repair machines </i><br>
<i>&gt; will have the programmed knowledge to detect damaged proteins </i><br>
<i>&gt; and to restore the original proteines. Etc.</i><br>
<p>
Okay, here's my problem: if you don't change the DNA, after 19/20 years<br>
(assuming the repair process to be perfect) you would have to do all the<br>
same thing again. Nanotechnology is not my area of expertise but I don't<br>
expect it to come cheap. Wouldn't it be easier to change the DNA errors?<br>
It's also not going to be cheap but at least it lasts more than<br>
nanotechnology repair.<br>
Overall, I think that we don't know if any of these processes will be<br>
possible at accessible prices. I'm graduating in Microbiology, I know<br>
gene therapy is here, I know genetic engineering is here, I know the<br>
Human Genome project will be completed in the near future but I don't<br>
know nothing of present or reliable near future technologies to do what<br>
you propose. Perhaps is ignorance of mine but I think that genetic<br>
transformation is the most likely choice for the future of life<br>
extension.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Such a procedure of using cell repair machines should also be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; repair damage created by cryonic preservation. Remember, damage is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same as destruction. Most (if not all) damage, created by cryonics, </i><br>
<i>&gt; that will render a cell biologically non-functional, can still be </i><br>
<i>&gt; repaired by cell-repair machines because the original structure </i><br>
<i>&gt; can still be DEDUCTED. I might add that cell repair machines will </i><br>
<i>&gt; be easily able to do that, because they will be controlled by </i><br>
<i>&gt; computers (with dimensions of cubic micrometers).</i><br>
<p>
I don't want to be rude, being you new to the list and everything, but,<br>
where did you come up with the ideas that the original neurons will be<br>
deducted and that cell repair machines will be able to do that? I don't<br>
know much of nanotechnology but, from what I know, I think it has some<br>
interesting applications, including computers and repair of cells, but<br>
from there to deduct, repair and/or rebuild a neuron goes a long way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Joa Pedro seems to have a misconception about cryonics.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I sugest Joao Pedro to read some information concerning molecular </i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotechnology, to start with the books "Engines of Creation" and </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Unbounding the Future", which are both available online! Many </i><br>
<i>&gt; articles written by Ralph C. Merkle should also prove interesting.</i><br>
<p>
Probably, the only extropian area where I feel comfortable is life<br>
extension.<br>
I'll try to find the books you recommend.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; What's the difference between altering you current brain and genome, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; transferring to a new one?  Is there something special about the neurons</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; that nature gave us?  And if they're so special, why don't you leave</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; them the way they are? I'm not so attached to them. As long as I can do</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; all the same things with my new consciousness-vehicle(or more things), why</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; should I care whether I've got organic axons or metal ones?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Joao Pedro then wrote:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Transferring? Transferring what? Your brain? Your 'soul'?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I never understood that uploading approach. Consciousness-vehicle? What</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is that? A machine with your thoughts? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Our brain is a network of neurons, the interactions between these</i><br>
<i>&gt; neurons </i><br>
<i>&gt; also generate our consciousness (or soul if you prefer). From</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiences </i><br>
<i>&gt; with artifcial neural networks and neurobiology it is known that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; behavior of the neural network is stored in it's structure (e.g. the </i><br>
<i>&gt; links between the neurons and the weight factors and switching values</i><br>
<i>&gt; (which are stored by proteins in the neurons) ). </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If we could emulate a biological neuron within certain limits, we could </i><br>
<i>&gt; in principle emulate the complete brain. (After scanning the existing </i><br>
<i>&gt; brain structure, which will be a bit tricky.) Research is </i><br>
<i>&gt; currently being done to exactly emulate single neurons using </i><br>
<i>&gt; conventional computer systems. However to upload a complete brain </i><br>
<i>&gt; such systems seem to be quite inadequate. More likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be used for this are networks of artificial neurons or neurons </i><br>
<i>&gt; emulated by cellular automa (in quantum dot electronics?).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (This is a bottom-up way of creating "artificial" intelligence.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; With the consciousness-vehicle is meant the physical system on which </i><br>
<i>&gt; the neural network is running, be it biological neurons, artificial </i><br>
<i>&gt; neurons, or an electronic system emulating neurons.</i><br>

<i>&gt; PER UNIT OF TIME of most fit offspring .</i><br>
<p>
No, I'll give you an example (note - fitness is the always the same):<br>
Let's suppose 2 organisms with a reproduction cycle of 1 year, one of<br>
them has an offspring of 100 in the first year and an offspring of 150<br>
in the second year and then dies. The other organism has an offspring of<br>
200 in the first year and then dies. The first organism had an offspring<br>
of 125 per year while the second had an offspring of 200 per year. By<br>
your assumption, the second organism would be favored by natural<br>
selection which is not the (usually) case. What if you have two<br>
organisms each of them with an offspring of 100 individuals per day but<br>
one of the organisms lives 10 days while the other lives 20, obviously,<br>
although both of them have the same offspring per day, the organism that<br>
lives longer has it's genes favored by natural selection.<br>
I understand, however, what are you trying to say. Say, two organisms<br>
capable of reproducing each day. If one of them has an offspring of 100<br>
in the first day and 150 in the second day and then dies while the other<br>
has an offspring of 200 in the first day and then dies. The second<br>
organism is favored by natural selection because he had an extra<br>
offspring in the first day of 100, if this offspring is ready for<br>
reproduction right away it will result in an extra 100*200 organisms.<br>
This is not the case in mammals, such as us, because we take several<br>
years before we reach sexual maturity. <br>
Anyway if I put something as "...can quickly produce..." is not wrong.<br>
Thanks for the tip.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Just our brain, is so much more advanced than a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; frog's that the possibilities of errors are incomparable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Indeed, the human brain is more complex than that of a frog (or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; mouse). But </i><br>
<i>&gt; I seem not to be able to think of any other organs (or parts) of a human</i><br>
<i>&gt; that are also much more complex.</i><br>
<p>
Let me see, important, vital organs, the endocrine system is more<br>
complex, presumably (I'm not sure) the immune system is more complex,<br>
perhaps the digestive system and the circulatory system too and probably<br>
others that my (very) limited knowledge of frog biology don't know.<br>
Also, like Geoff noticed, not only we are more complex but we are<br>
different and it is this differences (is our circulatory, respiratory,<br>
digestive system, etc) that might create incompatibilities between us<br>
and the frog's antifreeze.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Hkl</i><br>
<i>&gt; Because the future is where we will spend the rest of our lives ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; You see things and ask "Why?"  ;  I dream things and ask "Why not?"</i><br>
 <br>
That's nice, <br>
