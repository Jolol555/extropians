A.M.Genen asks<br>
: Wouldn't it make a lot more sense to eliminate the primary causes<br>
: of crime by eliminating poverty and deficient education? Wouldn't<br>
: it also cost less overall in both the short and long term?<br>
<p>
Well, yeah, separating state from economy and education would indeed<br>
have benefits we can't imagine.  But the statists are thoroughly<br>
entrenched in both areas, and won't be dislodged until the crash.<br>
Meanwhile, individuals can't do much about those evils, but we can <br>
do our bit about crime.  A year and a half ago I bought a pistol for<br>
$493 (including tax and licenses), and I spend less than $40 a month<br>
on target practice.  The welfare state costs half my earnings over<br>
most of my life, and achieves nothing.<br>
