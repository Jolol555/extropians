I'm currently teaching a Philosophy of Religion class. I'm about to examine<br>
the Design Argument which includes a discussion of evolution (where did all<br>
these complex creatures come from if not designed by a god...) Of course I<br>
have Dawkins The Blind Watchmaker at hand. But I'm hoping someone can<br>
suggest a really compact source of information on how evolutionary theory<br>
accounts for observations. I can already bring up examples such as how the<br>
theory explains maladjustments of structure -- insects that use wings to<br>
swim, the webbed feet of upland geese and of frigate birds which do not use<br>
them for paddling.<br>
<p>
Is there a compact source of such points that I can use, and perhaps copy<br>
for my students? There are a bunch of creationists in the classes, so the<br>
more solid examples I have at hand the better.<br>
<p>
I always use Dawkins' explanation of the evolution of the eye, but I want<br>
to improve on what I've done before. I'm disapointed at how few of the<br>
students have any background in biology and any comprehension of evolution.<br>
So, I'm trying to fit in a very brief but useful discussion of Darwin's<br>
ideas. It's been a while since I read The Blind Watchmaker, so perhaps I<br>
can find a few pages in there that do the job...<br>
<p>
BTW, a couple of weeks ago, after explaining humanism, I also explained<br>
extropianism to my 3 classes of 120 students. Getting *paid* to explain<br>
these ideas makes a nice change!<br>
<p>
Any suggestions appreciated.<br>
