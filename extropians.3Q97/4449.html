It's easy to dream up something better, the trouble is they're comparing the <br>
free market as it actually is, warts and all,  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Snip &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>

I fully share John K Clark's confidence in the reliability of the market<br>
mechanism when its technical requirements are satisfied, but we need to have<br>
more public discussion on the one big wart that is the mother of all the<br>
little warts attributed to the free market by its many opponents.  That big<br>
wart, IMHO, is the failure of corporations or governments to remove fixed and<br>
unavoidable costs from the variable cost data used by product lines or<br>
households to price their products and services in a competitive market.<br>
<p>
That big wart is very simple, a ten year old can understand it, but has been<br>
treated as an act of God in the media, in our schools, and on the internet;<br>
while the industrial nations have rested content with 5-25% unemployment and<br>
2-3% sustained inflation, since the 1890's.  I don't understand why!<br>
<p>
Let's talk about the warts.<br>
