<i>&gt;  The discussion about how to raise kids leads to the more general</i><br>

<p>
Many discussions eventually come down to the same thing - should freedom have<br>
limits? (duh?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Children are generally assumed to lack good judgement, especially when</i><br>
<i>&gt;  very young. But we all are like children in situations where we cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt;  know some or all of the important outcomes of our actions, or where we</i><br>
<i>&gt;  are aware of the outcomes but we attribute very different values to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  those outcomes than do others who care about the outcomes and/or us, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;  where we differ in the assessment of probabilities of various outcomes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  or all three.</i><br>
<p>
In the long-term we will have sensory-rich physically safe environments for<br>
both adults and children.  At present we do need some form of parenting and,<br>
yes, some form of government.  I believe in self-responsibility and<br>
spontaneous order, but currently the majority of individuals, like children,<br>
cannot support themselves.  Just as expect technology to increase the<br>
self-sufficiency and individuality of adults, I believe it will also have<br>
great affect on children.  If children are in an environment where they are<br>
physically safe there is no need for any such parenting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Who/what is going to act as the parent in such situations? Who gets to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  decide who is the child and who is the parent? Do "parents" have rights</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to impose their wills on "children?" I will take a Devil's Advocate</i><br>
<i>&gt;  position and say that (even in a post-human society) one of society's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  most important functions is to be the "meta-parent," deciding the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  policies that provide good answers to the above questions. As a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  meta-parent society must strike numerous balances among competing values</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and ignorance of outcomes. Else the resulting chaos and anarchy will</i><br>
<i>&gt;  reduce the society's potential to achieve win-win outcomes, and to avoid</i><br>
<i>&gt;  self-destruction (assuming self-destruction is something to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;  avoided!).</i><br>
<p>
Anarchy is not against supplying information (it's not _against_ anything).<br>
 The information to help you through life is there - at your fingertips - you<br>
can decide whether to listen and use that information without the need for<br>
coercion.  This can be done without government or parents.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Does this make me pro-government? No and Yes. Governments as we know</i><br>
<i>&gt;  them today by and large abdicate their responsibilities to be good</i><br>
<i>&gt;  meta-parents. But some form of self-regulating authority and enforcement</i><br>
<i>&gt;  is clearly needed, just as real parents are.</i><br>
<p>
Even a Child's mind can get by without government or parent coercion.<br>
 Animals, with far less intelligence, survive far harsher environments than<br>
any child does today (I'll admit the casualty rate is pretty high).  We are<br>
increasingly moving towards physically safer (but mentally challenging)<br>
environments.  We will still shape each other (even coerce each other) as<br>
individuals, without the need for any imposed hierarchical structure.<br>
<p>
Hierarchy          0<br>
Anarchy            1<br>
<p>
Next challenger please!<br>
<p>
--Wax<br>
<p>
If the government's granting you rights, there's something wrong.<br>
