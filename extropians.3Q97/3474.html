     Your very use of phrases like "YOUR reality" pegs the issue precisely: <br>
     there is only one reality.  Period.<br>

     Well that's absolutist enough to whet my appetite to engage.  Is this <br>
     something proveable or disproveable with empirical evidence or is it <br>
     something you have *decided* you believe?  <br>
     <br>
     For me, I believe there could be a singular and multiple realities in <br>
     conjunction.  Like there is a body and the cells that make it up.  A <br>
     holographic reality if you will.  But I'm going to stop there because <br>
     my thinking is "subjective", it's what I believe, and I personally <br>
     enjoy it.<br>
     <br>
     As was relayed to me in a psychedelic vision, "you put out in front of <br>
     you what you want to see because you are terrified of the void that <br>
     would be there were you not filling it with your own creative <br>
     efforts."<br>
     <br>
     Whether I imagined this or this is a universal truth is irrelevant to <br>
     me.  It could be both.  It could be neither.  What it is is *my* <br>
     reality.  My perspective.  My POV.  I have an angle of viewing the <br>
     universe that's unique to me.  Collectively we have a very animated <br>
     and interesting universe though.<br>
     <br>
     Anyone for pinball?<br>
