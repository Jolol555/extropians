: decide that "liberals" aren't human and thus without legal protection, or<br>
: perhaps that "bigots" aren't human and may therefore be "put down", etc.<br>
<p>
It is scary.  But distaste (or specious analogies to Nazism) is no<br>
reason to ignore the near certainty that our laws and customs will <br>
have to change to accommodate machine intelligence, enhanced animals, <br>
brainless human clones (organ banks), bio-gadgets using human brain <br>
tissue cultures, experimental human-animal chimeras, human minds <br>
copied into other media (and then altered or excerpted) ... or other <br>
innovations I can't yet imagine.<br>
<p>
If ever a bipedal animal that passes the Turing Test is denied human <br>
status, we can confidently say that the rule of law has thoroughly<br>
broken down, and people have other things than abortion (which is what<br>
started me on this tangent) to worry about.<br>
<p>
If nothing else, imagine the shopkeeper who, before accepting money for<br>
a box of crackers, must demand documentary evidence that the purchaser <br>
is "human" or risk prosecution (or forfeiture) for, in effect,<br>
receiving stolen money (because only a human is a moral agent capable<br>
of making a valid transaction).  I hope that merchants, at least, would<br>
insist on a broad definition of "human" rather than endure such hassles, <br>
even if they privately would be pleased to see the world rid of liberals <br>
or bigots or Jews.<br>
