<i>&gt; &gt;    2.0 John Gray (Mars/Venus): Interesting ideas, thin on facts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So John Gray is better than Hoagland? At least Hoagland gave us links to</i><br>
<i>&gt; his ideas. Well, I guess when we get to the bottom of the scale the</i><br>
<i>&gt; differences are negligible, but I must say, if I have to buy it, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; better be more than "thin on facts." Any gender stereotype is worthless</i><br>
<i>&gt; in my book, and stereotyping without facts is more than worthless, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; the memetic equivalent of entropy. And some guy is making beaucoup</i><br>
<i>&gt; d'argent off of it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; John Gray is definitely worse than an astrologer. He's predicting the</i><br>
<i>&gt; future of your relationship based upon not the heavens, but some</i><br>
<i>&gt; primordial fact sheet that only he has a copy of. No man is alike, no</i><br>
<i>&gt; woman is alike. And I leave it at that.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    1.0 ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    0.0 L. Ron Hubbard, Creationists, Astrologers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would add racists, misogynists, and relationahip experts to this as</i><br>
<i>&gt; well.</i><br>
<p>
Not if the particular racist, misogynist, or relationship expert has<br>
some respect for science.  Many call Teller a racist; he's still in<br>
the 8.0 - 10.0 range.  Einstein was a misogynist.  Political ideas<br>
and science are disjoint sets, and I for one refuse to allow my mind<br>
to be clouded by them.  This scale is about scientific integrity and<br>
only that, not about popularity.<br>
<p>
I gave Mr. Gray a 2.0, and astrologers a 0.0, because astrologers<br>
don't make any attempt whatsoever to test their ideas; many people<br>
have tested them, and they fail every time.  Mr. Gray may not have<br>
much of a scientific method, but he is /honest to his own observations/,<br>
and makes no apologies for them.  The fact that they are politically<br>
unpopular observations raises his score rather than lowering it,<br>
because he is showing that he doesn't give a damn what the popular<br>
egalitarian dogma of the country is.  What he sees is what he sees,<br>
and he refuses to change his observations from his own interpretation.<br>
<p>
The truth always matters, even if it's not pretty.  Those who hold<br>
on to the pretty-sounding bullshit of gender equality are willfully<br>
denying the plain evidence of their senses, and deserve scientific<br>
ridicule, even if they do happen to be nice guys.  Of course we want<br>
to grant equal rights under law, but that's a matter of law, not a<br>
matter of science.  There certainly are "stereotypes" based on<br>
ignorance and fear, and we should work to remove them.  But other<br>
generalizations based on the realities of human nature are valuable.<br>
Men and women have distinct natures, and studying those natures is<br>
good science; dismissing them all as "stereotypes" is dogmatic nonsense.<br>
