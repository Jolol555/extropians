I hope you cheer up, but it's not clear to me what you expect of us, how we <br>
could help or why you're worried. If it's just that the burdens of life are <br>
too great for you then you can always do what millions do, get the state to <br>
force us to carry them for you, in addition to the similar burdens we already <br>
have by virtue of also being alive just like you. Personally I think I could  <br>
handle the extra load and despite some intemperate remarks I have a hunch  <br>
you're a nice person so I wouldn't mind giving you a helping hand, although <br>
I'd resent like hell being forced to. But I don't think you're really worried <br>
about dying of starvation, I think you're worried of dying from despair<br>
because you'll feel worthless. If the root of your problem is not money, <br>
and I don't thing it is, then no economic system, not even the free market, <br>
can solve it. I sympathize, I don't want to sound callous and I really hope <br>
you don't die but nobody can give you self respect, regardless of how much <br>
money extorted from others by the state you receive each month.  You're going<br>
to have to find a reason to live from within yourself, the free market did <br>
not cause your problem nor can it solve it.<br>
I wish you a long and happy life. <br>
