<i>&gt; ...given the severity and irreversibility of the [sex change] operation</i><br>
<i>&gt; we are discussing, and the fact that many people asking for it have other</i><br>
<i>&gt; psychological problems, it doesn't seem inappropriate for the medical</i><br>
<i>&gt; profession to act as 'gatekeepers'... [to ensure that this]</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular, major, and undeniably medical, decision is not taken</i><br>
<i>&gt; mistakenly: and who better than the medical profession to do that? The</i><br>
<i>&gt; answer may come back, 'The individual concerned', but many such people are</i><br>
<i>&gt; not be in a suitable mental state to take such a decision: why should the</i><br>
<i>&gt; medical profession throw out its duty of patient care in these cases?</i><br>
<p>
If a person is mentally competent to engage in ordinary contracts, can<br>
hold a job, make decisions such concerning sexual relations, other<br>
medical procedures, and other important aspects of life, then any law<br>
or professional "standard" that interferes with that individual's<br>
decision is repugnant to individual sovereignty.<br>
<p>
Any doctor who dared to presume such a "responsibility" on my behalf<br>
I would fire on the spot.  I hire doctors for education and experience,<br>
so that they can advise me of all the options and risks; ALL decisions<br>
are mine, and mine alone, without exception.  Medicine is just a product<br>
like any other, and the doctor provides that product at my request and<br>
for my payment.  Any other "duty" he feels is only in his mind, and<br>
perhaps the legislature's.<br>
<p>
It is truly disheartening how many people mystify fields like<br>
medicine and law, treating their practitioners as something other<br>
than laborers no different from carpenters and plumbers, and somehow<br>
implying that they should be treated differently.  Well if I want<br>
green tile in my kitchen, I'm not going to listen to some builder<br>
telling me I'm not capable of that decision.  Why should I tolerate<br>
the same arrogance from a doctor or lawyer?<br>
