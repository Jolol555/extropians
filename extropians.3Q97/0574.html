Plan for what?  By anarchy, we are talking about spontaneous organization<br>
rather than forced organizations, not the absence of organization.  I will<br>
say that "creative collaboration" and decision by consensus is *not* the<br>
way to run an fast, flexible, and efficient business.  It may be more<br>
democratic, promote better communication, and possibly even be more<br>
intelligent, but it does not make good business sense in the majority of<br>
situations.  When was the last time you saw a committee do anything useful<br>
in a timely fashion?  Now would you really want to run an entire company<br>
that way?  I certainly wouldn't.  Strict heirarchies have their place.<br>
<p>
That said, though, I would like to say that I am generally very supportive<br>
of individual sovereignty in the work place.  Everyone has it, but most<br>
people don't realize it.  Most people seem to carry the perception that the<br>
heirarchy imposed in the workplace somehow carries over into the rest of<br>
their lives.  Subservience isn't necessary but sure is popular.  The<br>
receptionist is equal in all ways to the CEO, but with a different skill set.<br>
