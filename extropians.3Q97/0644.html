Antarctica reached the poles at least several tens of millions of years<br>
ago. Its rather dumb to assert that the presence of fossils proves that<br>
animals once lived at the poles, as they are most likely older than when<br>
the continent drifted that far south. THis is just like the dumb<br>
assertion of creationists who claim that the fact that there are<br>
shellfish fossils on Mount Ararat, this proves that the legend of Noah's<br>
Ark is true, as this shows that Mount Ararat was once under water.<br>
<p>
THis is always a great way to point out the contradictions in their<br>
idiotic theories. If they use this fossil evidence as fact, then the<br>
earth could not have been built in 4004 BC like they claim. They claim<br>
that older fossil evidence was created by God as a test of faith.... If<br>
so, then since the Ararat fossils are dated older than 4004 BC, then<br>
Ararat was never under water....<br>
<p>
The Poles were pretty much ice free somewhere around 6000 BC according<br>
to treee ring data. There were Alligators and hippos in the Thames at<br>
that time.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

Has anyone studied what the earth/moon system will do when disturbed by,<br>
say, a large meteor strike. Our own magnetic field and poles are<br>
generated by the rotational differential between the mantle and the<br>
core, caused by the tidal drag produced by the moon on the outer layers<br>
being greater than that at the core. If the moon is highly perturbed by<br>
another body, or disturbed by an impact, its whole orbital plane will<br>
change, which would then change the tidal drag vector it imposes on<br>
earth. If the earth is hit a glancing blow, it should be enough to put<br>
an even greater wobble in its attitude than that at present, or negate<br>
some of the present amount. These phenomenon might possibly be<br>
sufficient to cause the gyroscopic movement of our planetary dynamo to<br>
"tumble" as it were. Even then, it still wouldn't happen overnight.<br>
<p>
When these nuts talk about pole shift, it is the magnetic poles, not the<br>
rotational exis that they speak of. We know from astronomical evidence,<br>
and our own planet, that these two types of poles are not one and the<br>
same. As you can see by the scenarios above, it may take a much smaller<br>
astronomical event to cause a pole shift, if it occurs in just the right<br>
way.<br>
