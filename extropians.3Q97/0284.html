Thanks for the good wishes everyone!<br>
<p>
There are a lot of costs to going back to school when you're older,<br>
rather than just keeping on when you're younger, but I think one of the<br>
benefits is that it doesn't go to your head.<br>
<p>
I know I haven't changed that much; just learned the standards and<br>
literature of existing research in certain areas.  And I've had time<br>
to contribute my own research.  I also know full well there are lots<br>
of smart and interesting people without degrees.  And I know that if<br>
you want to directly attack the most interesting questions, you'll<br>
likely have to do that in your own spare time, whether you're an<br>
academic or not.<br>
<p>
There are lots of good reasons not to do what I've done, but "I<br>
couldn't do it" isn't one of them.  I'm pretty sure most of you could<br>
do this if you wanted, regardless of your age.  <br>
