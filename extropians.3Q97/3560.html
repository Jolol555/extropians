Um, no.  Actually, you would be simultaneously crushed and torn about.  As you<br>
got close to the singularity, assuming you headed in feet first, the atoms in<br>
your feet would be torn away and crushed into an infinitely dense point.  Then<br>
the atoms in your knees.  And so on.  You get torn apart from the feet up, but<br>
the loose parts get compacted again.<br>
<p>
Probably before that, your head and feet would get ripped off, heading in on<br>
their own time.  Before you start disintegrating, that is.  You're kind of<br>
being squeezed from one direction and torn apart from the other.  Drop a bit<br>
of liquid into a black hole and it assumes an egg shape that rapidly becomes<br>
very long and thin, until it finally becomes a cone of atoms and quarks<br>
funneling into a point.<br>
<p>
I also seem to recall that the tidal forces wouldn't become strong enough<br>
until the last 4 seconds or so... so enjoy the view.<br>
<p>
Got it?<br>
