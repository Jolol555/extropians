<p>
What was that? The reports of temporal dilation, unknown materials<br>
technology, and no discernable power source are all evidently beyond<br>
40's technology.<br>
<p>
There have been accounts by scientists who claimed to have inspected<br>
materials at Wright-Patt that the metals were nanoassembled, and that<br>
the bodies DNA had less than 10% of the amount of genetic info that<br>
humans have, indicating possible genetic engineering.<br>

<i>&gt; P.S. There have been some very good Roswell debunkings posted to</i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.alien.visitors lately. There is basically no first-hand evidence of</i><br>
<i>&gt; any of the major claims, and certainly nothing which can't be explained by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Mogul surveillance balloon theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Uh, Col. Corso, who just came out with a book, was on the recovery crew,<br>
supposedly, and was with the Joint Cheifs of Staff as well, so the claim<br>
of no first hand accounts is bogus. Of course, once all the alleged<br>
witnesses are dead, it will be easy to say, "well there are no first<br>
hand accounts, so its a fake". Marcel, Brazel, and the local funeral<br>
director (who delivered child sized coffins) have all made first hand<br>
accounts.<br>
<p>
Also, the Mogul balloon theory would fit thescattered materials found at<br>
the Brazel ranch, if the materials technology problem was not there.<br>
Additionally, vets who worked on that project said that balloon<br>
materials were not classified, as they were pretty basic stuff, only the<br>
purpose of the project was classfied. If this was so, why were the<br>
materials shipped on a priority flight to Wright-Patt under guard? This<br>
is a known fact that the GAO's report did disclose. THis incongruity in<br>
security  statuses rings bells in this veterans mind.<br>
<p>
Also, the Mogul theory does not fit the first hand reports of intact,<br>
damaged wreckage being recovered at another site closer to Roswell, the<br>
recovery of which by military personnell was witnessed by a number of<br>
people on a geological or archaeological expedition, several of whom<br>
have given first hand accounts.<br>
<p>
Personally, I don't know. I do know of the things I saw when I was in<br>
the Air Force that I still can't talk about. Given that all of the stars<br>
in our region of the galaxy are relatively the same age, I would give it<br>
a 50% chance that we've been visited in the past or will be visited<br>
within the next 100 years. The fact that we put out as much radio energy<br>
as a small star should ring some bells in some radio observatories on<br>
other planets when the c sphere reaches them. I think that most of the<br>
unexplained UFO sightings today are classified aircraft projects,<br>
something which I am involved in tracking with a private group I work<br>
with. I also think that most of the hysteria in the public these days is<br>
purposely generated disinformation put out by governments seeking to<br>
create a PR cover for their covert activites. This is something I was on<br>
the other side of once, so I know that this is true.<br>
<p>
I think that the surest sign that the occupants of UFOs are intelligent<br>
is the fact that they pointedly refuse to be interviewed by our press...<br>
