&lt;&lt;  I much  <br>
      prefer our research dollars going towards restoring and improving  <br>
      earth conditions and listening for "come back" signals from out there.<br>
<i> &gt;&gt; </i><br>
 <br>
I surprised to hear such a comment coming from the Extropian mailing list.<br>
 Why would we need to sink more research on Earth, where we already have<br>
billions sunk--for all of human history?  People in every country, without<br>
exception, have never had a better life.   Life on Earth has had a good run<br>
of research funding improving conditions.  It's about time we look out wards.<br>
  We have sunk enough money on this little planet.   "Come back" signals?<br>
 That would be fantastic too, even if it came from microscopic life forms.<br>
  Remember WE are also "microscopic life forms."  We are a colony of about a<br>
trillion cells who don't know they are part of us.  How do we know the<br>
microscopic life forms we find on other planets are not part of a larger<br>
organism?  Also, think of these hostile extra-Earthly environments and how<br>
the exobiological processes we discover will teach us how to adapt to those<br>
environments.  I want to get off this Earth as soon as possible.  Earth was a<br>
nice warm little nest for babies.  Now, sooner or later we should grow up,<br>
become adults, and leave the nest.<br>
