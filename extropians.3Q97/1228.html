Steve Witham:<br>
<i>&gt;Yes, but why?  "Want" is just a shorthand.  The question is, *why*, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;your opinion, it's in the interests of "social institutions" (and, as Robin</i><br>
<i>&gt;points out, you seem to mean *all* of them--baseball, trade, the word</i><br>
<i>&gt;"the," etc.)</i><br>
<p>
I do not think that Robin was asking me the question in these terms, <br>
as he understands that we are talking about social institutions in <br>
terms of sociology, which refers to specific complex structures that <br>
exist in a broader sense than those you mention.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;.. to conceal rather than reveal their own constructions? </i><br>
<p>
I already explained this, in a paragraph that I worried might offend <br>
Robin, as it explained Basics.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why don't they benefit by being up-front and above-board instead?  Why</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't they benefit by actively *encouraging* exploration of and challenge</i><br>
<i>&gt;to their constructions?  Isn't criticism helpful?  Isn't openness good</i><br>
<i>&gt;publicity?  At least in some cases?</i><br>
<p>
In comparing individual agents with the societal structures they live <br>
within, you miss the important factor that social institutions do not <br>
necessarily exist for the benefit of individual development and often <br>
work against it.  Social institutions exist to form order, and to <br>
allocate benefits and responsibilities.  This is not a personal <br>
argument, it is one of the beginning tenets of sociology, and also <br>
political science.  If this subject interests you, and from the <br>
questions you ask, I think that it does, I recommend looking up a <br>
good basic text.  Many libertarian writers get into these questions <br>
as well.<br>
