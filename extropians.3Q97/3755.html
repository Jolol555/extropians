James North quotes:<br>
<i> &gt; from Mouse Monitor, sept. 1997 by Robert E. Bauman:    "The US</i><br>
<i> &gt; Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)</i><br>
<i> &gt; on May 21, in a little-noticed rule proposal, began the government's</i><br>
<i> &gt; take-over of all forms of electronic and digital cash in America.</i><br>
<i> &gt; For the first time the US government asserted direct control over</i><br>
<i> &gt; all so-called financial "stored value systems," defined as "...funds</i><br>
<i> &gt; or monetary value represented in digital format (whether or not</i><br>
<i> &gt; encrypted) and stored, or capable of storage, on electronic media...as</i><br>
<i> &gt; to be retrievable and transferable electronically." (Official text</i><br>
<i> &gt; at <a href="http://www.moneylaundering.com">http://www.moneylaundering.com</a> ) This definition covers so-called</i><br>
<i> &gt; "smart cards", online Internet banking and any other cash transactions</i><br>
<i> &gt; in electronic form."</i><br>
<p>
"asserted direct control"?  Talk is cheap.  How do they intend<br>
to enforce this direct control?<br>
<p>
I guess they could do it if they repeal the First and Fourth<br>
Amendments to the US Constitution.<br>
<p>
Digital cash works like this: Alice escrows a stack of copper ingots<br>
with Trent, and they agree on a number.  Alice wants to be able to<br>
give the stack of copper ingots to some other party without having<br>
to fetch them back from Trent, so Trent and Alice agree that Trent<br>
will surrender the copper ingots to anyone who presents the number.<br>
<p>
Later on, Bob gives Alice several bushels of wheat, and in<br>
exchange Alice tells Bob the number.  Later on, Bob goes to<br>
Trent, shows him that he knows the number, and Trent gives him<br>
the copper ingots.<br>
<p>
This is the essentials, working on the honor system.  The rest of<br>
the complex details of digital cash are just mathematical arrangements<br>
to ensure that no one involved can cheat any of the other<br>
parties.  But if everyone were honest, then the above scenario<br>
would be fundamentally the same as any digital cash system.<br>
It's just barter with an added layer of written conversation.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I think that FINCEN's statement is just propagandistic<br>
talk intended to spread Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt, and to<br>
scare non-cryptologists away from using digital cash schemes<br>
that the government hasn't approved of.  And the US Federal<br>
government, so far, has shown no signs of approving any digital<br>
cash implementation that it can't break when it wants to cheat.<br>
<p>
Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, folks.<br>
