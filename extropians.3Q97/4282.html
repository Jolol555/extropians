Hi!<br>

Do you think I mention terms, of my area of expertise, without knowing<br>
what they mean? Like mention below, I couldn't apply the term to<br>
economic systems in the context in which EvMick applied the term. More,<br>
he wrote:<br>

<p>
I still, today, can't understand why do you (or some of you) think this<br>
would happen. And that certainly puzzled me up a bit. BTW, I still think<br>
monopolies happen in a free-market and I still can't understand why<br>
would negative feedback prevent this and the exploration of the<br>
population by any corp.<br>

<i>&gt; `Negative feedback' is *not* primarily an economics term, but derives from</i><br>

<i>&gt; least 50 years old, and is the basis of all advanced control systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps it is called something entirely different in your own language, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is defined in most English dictionaries.  I keep a dictionary on my</i><br>
<i>&gt; desk, and another on my kitchen table, and when I see a word I don't know I</i><br>
<i>&gt; look it up - I don't start by asking other people.  If it's not in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; dictionary, I look in the encyclopedia in my study, and if it's not there</i><br>
<i>&gt; *then* I have no hesitation in asking.  </i><br>
<p>
Like I mentioned before, I know the meaning of the word but I couldn't<br>
find an appropriate application for it in economy, in the context of our<br>
argument, in explaining to me the author's (EvMich) point of view. Like<br>
I said a thousand times, I don't know nothing of economics besides<br>
common sense and applying a term I know from biology (and don't use in<br>
my daily life) to economics and figuring out how things happen in<br>
economical systems according to EvMich's perspective was not up to my<br>
skills. Also, actually disagreeing with EvMick's point was not a good<br>
way to understand what he was trying to say.<br>
<p>
I hope this matter is dead and buried (Damien, I know your intention is<br>
good and I'm glad you cleared up some misunderstandings). Ironically<br>
speaking, I think I'm a much better human being now that I know the<br>
meaning of negative<br>
feedback and why corporations won't be able to be in a monopoly<br>
situation because of it.<br>

<p>
I was looking for information but even I wasn't sure about how serious<br>
this information would be.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you are really interested in learning about anything READ BOOKS!  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; you think book reading is "boring" you clearly have little interest in</i><br>
<i>&gt; acquiring knowledge.</i><br>
<p>
There are books that I find amusing to read, there are books I find<br>
interesting to read and there are books I find boring to read (and<br>
usually stop in the beginning). I read several books about aging, a<br>
subject I find most interesting and disturbing but I never read a book<br>
about economics and would probably be bored to death if I would. It's a<br>
matter or choice and personal taste.<br>
I might read a couple of articles on the net about economy, I still have<br>
some doubts I would like to clear out. Perhaps one day I even read a<br>
book about economy!<br>

Tell me something, wouldn't you like to see the extropian movement<br>
expand itself? Wouldn't you like to see more extropians than there are<br>
now? Presumably, the answer is yes. Do you think you teach other persons<br>
the extropian principles and thought by telling them to read books?<br>
Personally, I have a fame of being a good guitarist, do you think that<br>
when someone asks me how to do a A chord, I tell him/her that he/she is<br>
stupid and should go and look for it in a book? Even more time-taking<br>
questions, do you think I just say that people who ask me these<br>
questions are ignorant and shouldn't even deserve to be by my side? Of<br>
course not, I would like more and more persons to learn guitar and since<br>
I love it, I teach anyone who asks me to, within the limits of my<br>
knowledge, even that I have to give the same answer 10, 20, 100, 500<br>
times.<br>
Now, do you think that you spread the extropian movement by sitting<br>
around thinking: - I'm very smart, the others are ignorants and only<br>
when they, by their own means, know as much as I, will I then see them<br>
as my fellows. Honestly, this is how some of you acted when I asked my<br>
questions, if you really want to make the extropian movement (or any<br>
other ideology) grow, you have to teach people it's principles, many<br>
times. Do you think Jesus Christ (no matter your religion, you have to<br>
admit he was good at convincing people) just answered questions by<br>
saying: - Read it in the bible, it will be out in a decade or so.<br>
It's true that the subject I was asking questions about was not directly<br>
an extropian subject but, even so, you (I take this opportunity to say<br>
that when I say "you" I don't mean all of you but a few who certainly<br>
know that this message is directed at them) showed a lack of will to<br>
teach others that won't lead you nowhere in terms of spreading your<br>
ideas.<br>
Instead of being a small group of which no-one (at least in Portugal)<br>
has ever heard of, and taking 20, 50, 100 or 500 years to develop<br>
nanotech and life extension, if others would support "our" (this is a<br>
"our" between commas because I don't agree with all your principles)<br>
cause this objectives would much soon be achieved.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe people are glancing over your posts because you have obviously</i><br>
<i>&gt; glanced over the introductory message to this mailing list.  Joao, people</i><br>
<i>&gt; are not impressed with your posts because you have obviously not read any</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the suggested material in the introductory message to this mailing</i><br>
<i>&gt; list.  Your post is not uncommon; on the contrary, posts like yours are</i><br>
<i>&gt; bogging this list, and people are getting a little tired of answering the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same old questions, over and over.  I'm sure you can understand this.</i><br>
<p>
OK, I went over and read the introduction to the mailing list. First, I<br>
read Dawkin's books suggested in the introduction but that was it.<br>
Second, although there are a few suggestions to asking questions about<br>
anything, I found this:<br>
<i>&gt; The Extropian list is not meant to proselytize, to gain converts.</i><br>
<p>
Personally, like I mention above, I completely disagree.<br>
<p>
As a conclusion, like I mentioned in my last message, I won't bother you<br>
again about economics or any issues in which I don't have a good<br>
knowledge (great, I'll just write about aging, at least in that subject<br>
I can take on anyone). I would just like to express this last ideas and<br>
I hope that this matter is over (I'm not afraid to argue with anyone, if<br>
you want to continue, just mail me privatly). <br>
<p>
Even so, I think I learned much from this past discussion,<br>
