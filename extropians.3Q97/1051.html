<p>
Actually, it's worse than that.  The job itself can be a noisy signal,<br>
since people often mold a job around their skills.  If I find an applicant<br>
who's very good in one area but not great in another, I think about how I<br>
can adjust the job requirements to them.  And often I don't even have a<br>
perfect idea of the job I need done.  (Mind you, the solution is often to<br>
hire people who seem *really* smart, regardless of their background, and<br>
use them in what ever way works.)<br>
<p>
I find I'm bothered by the claim that interviews are not predictive, though<br>
I  have heard that in many places.  At a previous company, we gave a<br>
take-home programming test to the applicants that looked interesting.  At<br>
least once I chose a programmer who had a less impressive test but better<br>
people and verbal skills, because they would need to work in a team with<br>
non-programmers.  Some how I don't think IQ would have captured that<br>
difference.<br>
