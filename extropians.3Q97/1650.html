<i>&gt; Reference: Aristoi by Walter Jon Williams</i><br>
<i>&gt;                : Latest book by Louis McMaster BuJold (Mirror Dance?) about</i><br>
<i>&gt; Miles' Clone Brother</i><br>
<i>&gt;                : Society of the Mind by Marvin Minsky</i><br>
<i>&gt;                : a variety of "split brain" studies in patients in which the</i><br>
<i>&gt; corpus collusum was surgically severed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                : various "multiple personality disorder" cases</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How much of the brain does it take to support the personality? Surely the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Visual Cortex is not required for that function...nor are the areas of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain relating to the other senses (smell, taste, hearing, touch etc) nor</i><br>
<i>&gt; that which is required to support the metabolism.  (keep the heart pumping ,</i><br>
<i>&gt; liver, kidney...etc)...ignore all of that and what have we left? What per</i><br>
<i>&gt; centage of the brain relative to it's size?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now look at it from a different perspective.  How many personalities occupy</i><br>
<i>&gt; that space?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My understanding of the "Society of Mind" and other works is that there are a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bunch.  Operating sequentially and simultaneously.  Split Brain studies</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggest this as well.  In a well integrated "psyche" there appears to be only</i><br>
<i>&gt; one personality....not true....there are many personalities....each coming</i><br>
<i>&gt; "on line" as the situation warrants...and going dormant when not needed. All</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking it is the only one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Walter Jon Williams and Louis McMaster Bujold's works speculate as to what</i><br>
<i>&gt; would happen were this not the case.  Suppose you had multiple personalities,</i><br>
<i>&gt; a well integrated "team" of personalities.  I REALLY wish I did....have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; personallity who didn't find lifting weights to be unutterably boring....so I</i><br>
<i>&gt; could do something interesting while he was exercising the body.</i><br>

I consider that, an interesting way to understanding such subjetcs is <br>
using the informatic systems theory. Each "personality" (not yet <br>
individuallity...) would just be seen as a procedure (or a set of <br>
procedures). By hypothesis, there would be just one individuallity <br>
per human being  (the main operational system) but various possible <br>
sets of procedures (behaviour environments...) ( a supposed devil <br>
domination , f. ex., would be really impossible, inexistent, except <br>
as a set of procedures "uploaded" form an influenceable person's <br>
mind...Just go to any of these cults, if you're thinking I'm not <br>
talking about present facts...). When a "form" (menthal <br>
configuration) is still "coming to the mind screen" it is quickly <br>
associated with other related forms (rational and emotional, s tatic <br>
and dynamic) to make an associated work environment. Such <br>
associations do not necessarily correspond to reallity, but form a <br>
menthal environment... See, for ex., the believers when "think in <br>
God" (hehehe) or an Orson Wells' reader, when thinking about Mars...  <br>
That's a hypothesis... Another question is:  The individuallity <br>
minimum nucleus is just software or hardware too ??????<br>
