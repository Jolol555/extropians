Yeah, that's what they told me in public school, too.  Another reason for<br>
preserving the several States was to ensure that Washington was not the<br>
only power center.  Of course, highway taxes and the Supreme Court have<br>
buried that quaint notion.<br>

: the Constitution continues to operate perfectly against tyrants, other<br>
: menaces such as bureaucracy and paperwork are threatening to choke the<br>
: country, and might very well do just that, if continued unchecked.<br>
<p>
I wonder what Eliezer means by "tyrants", when Presidents routinely<br>
start wars without waiting for Constitutional formality, when the Supreme<br>
Court calls looting and extortion "essential police powers" ...<br>
