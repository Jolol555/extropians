should be the prime concern of all civilized beings. <br>
**************************************************************<br>
Dear fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
What the public has allowed to pass for leadership in our federal, state<br>
and local governments -- and out other social organizations as well -- has<br>
been, to an unfortunate extent, self-serving and egocentric rather than<br>
altruistic and humane. This might be due to the social orientation of our<br>
times. We have given a minority in our society excessive authority by<br>
default. As a consequence of our actions -- and inactions -- most of us<br>
have placed ourselves in a position where we choose to live our lives<br>
without much meaning, power and responsibility in a society lacking clear<br>
direction. <br>
<p>
We frequently focus on irrelevant headlines, superficial stories and<br>
emotion oriented sound bites designed to encourage the dreams and<br>
vicarious adventures many of us feel we need o fill the voids in our<br>
existence. The relative emptiness of our lives is rarely reflected in the<br>
pervasive simplistic content of the mass media. Any sensible person who<br>
has developed the ability to do their own thinking can probably draw that<br>
conclusion with minimal intellectual effort.<br>
<p>
Regrettably, most members of our society have not yet developed the<br>
capacity to transcend heir initial emotional reaction to the mass media<br>
and other social stimuli. Largely, this has been due to the hierarchical<br>
social orientation of our educational systems. Many of us have been<br>
trained to respect and be directed by symbols and figures of authority<br>
without much question.<br>
<p>
Our society is, however, undergoing increasing, and accelerating changes.<br>
These changes place an increased emphasis on a power shift toward ever<br>
greater self-determination and self-reliance in a non-hierarchical, team<br>
and group oriented community an work environment. In response, our<br>
educational systems are gradually being re-oriented with an increased<br>
emphasis on individual initiative and self-actualization. More and more of<br>
us are beginning to think for ourselves. As our social and educational<br>
evolution continues, our reliance and respect for most authority figures<br>
and symbols have -- and contunue to -- diminish.<br>
<p>
As we continue our progress through the post-industrial era, however, we<br>
are regularly confronted and assaulted by the obscurantist resistance of<br>
many of our traditional social and political structures and workplaces.<br>
Their wish is to prevent such changes and maintain their power and<br>
position in our society. By attempting to preserve a dubious status quo,<br>
such persons frequently use their authority to promote friction and<br>
conflicts between our many and diverse social, economic and cultural<br>
communities. By fractionalizing our society, these established powers and<br>
elites seeks to use our petty jealousies against ourselves.<br>
<p>
Those conservative elements in our society that fear such changes need to<br>
be confronted in a pro-active and progressive manner. All forms of social,<br>
culural, political and economic authority and administration need to be<br>
reformulated. An environment must be created where our increasing<br>
knowledge, skills and abilities rather than the social, political and<br>
economic influence and status in a hierarchy are the determining factors. <br>
<p>
As we develop and -- hopefully -- work to carry out an agenda based on<br>
respect for each individual and cooperation within our community, we must<br>
thoroughly consider the broader social and cultural implications of each<br>
of our initiatives. There is, for example, a substantial need to<br>
continuously involve each member of society in cooperatively deciding and<br>
carrying out the internal and external policies of their society, culture<br>
and workplace.<br>
<p>
Such changes require us to overcome our many preconceived political<br>
biases, fixations and hostilities. We must all work at creating a<br>
political and structural environment directed toward modifying and<br>
enhancing the political and bureaucratic structures we ar required to live<br>
in. Direct legislative and legal initiatives should therefore be given a<br>
much higher priority. A greater degree of public involvement must be<br>
achieved than has been the case in the past. <br>
<p>
There should be little doubt that there will be some within our society<br>
who will have great difficulty understanding these changes and the need<br>
for further, and continuous changes. Unfortunately, there will always be a<br>
few who, lacking vision, will continue their attempts to manipulate and<br>
undermine our social and cultural structures to gain greater personal<br>
power at the expense of others. There will also be those who will continue<br>
to consider themselves ahead of the legitimate needs of their fellow<br>
members of society and its constituents.<br>
<p>
To some extent, however, these contemporary social conflicts can be<br>
overcome through continuous and credible education and the re-orientation<br>
of our society into a broad-based, interactive, and ethical community.<br>
Credibility is based on sincerity. The needs of all of the members of<br>
society and the community must take precidence. A constructive dialogue<br>
among all members of a ommunity should be aimed at achieving greater<br>
social cohesion while while promoting cultural diversity. This is an<br>
achievable goal in a society that learns to see beyond itself.<br>
