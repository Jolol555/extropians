Neuro Semantic Political Illusion Complex (NSPIC)<br>
<p>
                                by Jim Legg <br>
<p>
Frederick Mann's NSPIC debate started on September 22, 1997 and promised<br>
to be the ultimate wait-and-see-pudding. However, as the extropy list<br>
short circuited basic discussion, I now cancel my subscription. I can be<br>
still contacted by email to review my following involvement.<br>
<p>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Unlike hierarchical rule based classic expert systems as criticized by<br>
Dreyfus and Winograd <br>
and Flores, my alternative amathematical contribution to consensus stems<br>
from the use of <br>
AI developed as The Ingrid Thought Processor. Ingrid descends indirectly<br>
from George <br>
Kelly's inquiry into human nature called Personal Construct Theory.<br>
During decades of time <br>
spent re-developing Ingrid, I discovered that patterns elevate into<br>
dominance sometimes <br>
discontinuously overturning established order. Nowadays my pet project<br>
for developing a <br>
continuously unfolding awareness has stalled awaiting the Internet's<br>
massive computing <br>
resources to handle the parallel and scalable patterns.  However, Ingrid<br>
is not a reductio ad <br>
absurdum as my hubris claims it is and it is now surfacing on the<br>
Internet as a result of the <br>
rubbishing and destruction of AI's other critical tools. <br>
<p>
Last December (as background to the NSPIC debate,) I created a<br>
juxtaposition and <br>
geometrical psychological spoof called Counter Capitalism R.I.P. adapted<br>
and edited from <br>
Bob Penny's critique of mind control. This is a project of mine that<br>
started out comparing <br>
web counters to capitalism. It has since developed into a computational<br>
inquiry of a social <br>
theory. In a website I examine and narrate elements of NSPIC and<br>
conclude there is an <br>
impossible transference between hierarchical plans vs chaotic<br>
permeability. I was so <br>
intrigued by Frederick Mann's request that today I quickly processed his<br>
seven purposes for <br>
debating NSPIC using The Ingrid Thought Processor and I thought the<br>
results good enough <br>
to make the freeware available here. <br>
<p>
Ingrid in its present form, as used in semantics (encompassing both the<br>
rational and <br>
irrational,) already gained for me a benefit in transcending this<br>
political illusion, namely that <br>
of metaphorically "having our cake and eating it too." <br>
<p>
Below is the raw data and explanations of the abbreviations I used (note<br>
that I inadvertently <br>
entered Purpose 5 &amp; 6 in reverse order.) This is followed by a textual<br>
analysis of a Decision <br>
Grid named "NSPIC Hierarchy Chaos Debate" completed by me on 09-18-1997.<br>
The grid <br>
was formed by evaluating 7 Purposes in terms of 7 considerations using a<br>
70 % significance <br>
factor. <br>
<p>
As the final picture represents a slice from my proprietary belief<br>
space, the analogy I use to <br>
explain this image is that of looking into the cross section of an<br>
inflated inner tube. My <br>
perspective flows in from the south east then up around the<br>
undifferentiated items in the <br>
middle and seeks a resolution in the north east. The analysis and<br>
synthesis of the character <br>
of this grid will develop in a tick-tock fashion by semantically<br>
wrapping a 'story like bandage' <br>
around this 'inner tube.' <br>
  <br>
The consensus raw material data is available as is the freeware  and the<br>
Ingrid Tutor. <br>
<p>
<p>
   TO MAINTAIN THE ILLUSION OF <br>
   FREE SPEECH THE EXTROPY LIST <br>
    PROCLAIMS ITSELF UNFIT TO <br>
        DISCUSS BASICS<br>
<p>
                 "youth and skill can always knock out old age and<br>
treachery"<br>

<p>
Frederick, please let me say how much I admire your revelations of what<br>
it took for you to <br>
bring this debate here. I'm a rejoined extropian list member and I came<br>
here specifically for <br>
this debate because I have something to offer.<br>
<p>

<p>
I don't yet understand where else you have debated NSPIC before now. I'm<br>
playing catch up <br>
with your mindset the best way I know how. I stress that there is a<br>
tacit understanding on my <br>
page whether you refuse to see it or not. At this stage of the debate my<br>
understanding of <br>
what you're doing with NSPIC is quid pro quo. I hope you're not<br>
deliberately being a evasive <br>
with your display of ignorance about my intentions. To which I will with<br>
tact rate the <br>
discontinuously significant barrier of you being a Judas Sheep in<br>
betraying others like me to <br>
the secret police of the META tag on the extropy list. <br>
<p>
I have the impression -- perhaps misguided on my part -- that you're on<br>
terms with <br>
"radically libertarian psychology," and a defender of price economics<br>
remaining in its <br>
current form. Please convince me otherwise or you will skeptically<br>
oppose me with your <br>
disbelief. Your decisions will force my loss of formulation as<br>
determined by Dramatica <br>
Theory. It's therefore important for this debate that you and the rest<br>
of the extropy list <br>
unconditionally surrender all ideas of having money and evaluate the<br>
replacement of belief <br>
in price in order to transcend the illusion of price. <br>
<p>
If this can't be done the destruction of Ingrid will cause terrible loss<br>
and retribution in the <br>
public exposing and overturning the terrorcrats. If such an entity<br>
exists (the extropy META <br>
police) it is to now cease tactless email hiccups during this debate, no<br>
one running <br>
interference - ok? Otherwise I hope you're prepared to declare this<br>
debate publicly exposed <br>
here on the family group known the extropian list. It is demonstrably<br>
important to realizing <br>
that forceful skill with Ingrid is my singularity's means to communicate<br>
to extropians about <br>
NSPIC. Are you aware that Tony Blair, Britain's new PM, is trained in<br>
and seems to approve <br>
of this repertory grid technique.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; impression -- perhaps misguided on my part -- that he thinks he</i><br>
already knows all the elements of NSPIC <br>
and has written them on his website. But I couldn't find there even one<br>
of the elements I think I've identified.<br>
<p>
Don't jump to conclusions, this is only the circumspection phase of the<br>
debate. Tell me <br>
what you think after you "See What You Think..." Feel free to send me an<br>
updated list of <br>
your elements and the related grid values. As yet I haven't seen any.<br>
Frederick, you may have <br>
an inventory of identified elements. As these become known from your<br>
email, they will add <br>
to my Ingrid program and the results will change on the website. It is<br>
empirically analytical <br>
and can show consensus.<br>
<p>
This is the list of elements that I have seen as this debate stands.<br>
Your seven purposes are <br>
starring at right you. If you don't think purposes are elements, then<br>
sorry to sound harsh but <br>
please back off your inappropriate use of the word 'element'. <br>

<p>
Initial cut &amp; paste interpretation:<br>
<p>
The consideration which discriminates most between the Purposes of<br>
Frederick <br>
Mann's proposed NSPIC debate is the The NSPIC debate itself followed by<br>
the difficulty of <br>
adapting existing belief systems &amp; the objections of the current form of<br>
Statism. Little <br>
discrimination between the Purposes was exhibited in terms of the<br>
Freeware called <br>
The Ingrid Thought Processor  &amp; the current style of the Extropy<br>
Institute. <br>
<p>
The Purposes for which the strongest responses were given in terms of <br>
considerations is to identify the barriers to understanding NSPIC ,<br>
followed by <br>
development of the means to communicate about NSPIC to extropians  &amp;<br>
identification of a series <br>
of steps to transcend NSPIC . This does not mean that these Purposes are<br>
necessarily <br>
the most important but they are the ones that Jim Legg feels most<br>
strongly <br>
about. <br>
<p>
The most highly positively related considerations are the current style<br>
of the <br>
Extropy Institute &amp; the difficulty of adapting existing belief systems <br>
. This means that <br>
the Purposes that are highly affected by the current style of the<br>
Extropy Institute are <br>
also highly affected by the difficulty of adapting existing belief<br>
systems  &amp; vice versa. <br>
The opposite condition applies to the objections of the current form of<br>
Statism &amp; the <br>
NSPIC debate itself. <br>
<p>
ANALYSIS: <br>
<p>
The NSPIC debate itself MAY NOT identify all the elements of NSPIC DUE<br>
TO the current <br>
style of the Extropy Institute AND the objections of the current form of<br>
Statism AGAINST <br>
developing the means to communicate about NSPIC to extropians. <br>
<p>
To improve the formulation of NSPIC WITHOUT the difficulty of adapting<br>
existing belief <br>
systems AND the need to obtain Consensus AI CAN identify the thinking<br>
skills needed to <br>
transcend NSPIC.  <br>
<p>
The time required to implement AND to identify the barriers to<br>
understanding NSPIC AND <br>
to outline the benefits gained from understanding and transcending NSPIC<br>
IS BEST <br>
SERVED BY identification of a series of steps to transcend NSPIC USING<br>
the Freeware <br>
called The Ingrid Thought Processor. <br>
<p>
                                                                                                     <br>
<p>
SYNTHESIS:<br>
<p>
By force of language, parasites can always be exposed and made to<br>
resign.<br>
