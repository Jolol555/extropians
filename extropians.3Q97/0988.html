<i>&gt; Cosmology aside, this is precisely what I never understood from _The</i><br>

<i>&gt; environmental input factors that conditioned that being?</i><br>
<p>
Generally, it does seem correct that in order to create a person who<br>
thinks he has experienced X, we have to have simulated X to at least<br>
the level of detail remembered by that person.  If you want to create<br>
someone with memories of combat in Vietnam, you will have to have created<br>
specific combat events for him to remember.<br>
<p>
It may not be necessary though to simulate every detail of the Vietnam<br>
experience down to the water droplets dripping from leaves in the jungle<br>
all around him.  According to some studies we've discussed here, the<br>
actual amount of data which goes into long term memory is very small on<br>
average, perhaps only one bit per second or so.  Naturally, some times<br>
are remembered much better than others, and even forgotten events can<br>
have a significant influence on future behavior.  But broadly speaking it<br>
may be possible to have a way to create a person with memories which<br>
realistically simulate a Vietnam experience without actually simulating<br>
every detail.<br>
<p>
Even if it turns out that detailed simulation is sometimes necessary,<br>
there can still be economies of scale.  There could be a generic<br>
20th century simulation which could be used as the basis for creating<br>
huge numbers of possible 20th-century citizens.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even if there are only x^y states of ~Qmatter~R possible and infinite</i><br>
<i>&gt; computational resources at Omega could compute all possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; combinations, how could ~QThe System~R ever *select* those</i><br>
<i>&gt; configurations that might have had some resemblance to actual history</i><br>
<i>&gt; (which would seem to be required in order to call this a</i><br>
<i>&gt; ~Qresurrection~R)?</i><br>
<p>
This reminds me of an interesting point raised by Hans Moravec here on<br>
this list once.  As Mark says, in some ways it seems that selection is an<br>
important step in giving "reality" to the simulated systems.  If you had<br>
infinite computer power, you could simulate every possible system in every<br>
possible sequence of states.  But this raises the question of whether<br>
you have actually accomplished anything in doing so.  In some sense,<br>
it seems like by generating every possible system, without actually<br>
selecting out those which are meaningful, you have blurred them all<br>
together and it is as though you haven't generated any systems.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure I agree with this; Moravec is a Platonist and believes that<br>
all these systems have reality independent of whether they are actually<br>
instantiated.  Simulating a hypothetical being merely gives us access to<br>
him; he exists independent of our efforts.<br>
<p>
A more materialistic view is that the only systems which can have reality,<br>
including awareness, are those which are actually implemented at some<br>
point in the real world.  In that case, simulating a system which<br>
represented a conscious being would in fact bring him into existence.<br>
This would be true even if his simulation was just one variant on an<br>
infinite number of themes, monkeys typing on infinite typewriters.<br>
