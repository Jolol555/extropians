<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Oh, come now, you should know better than that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"How many legs does a dog have, if you call a tail a leg?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"Four - calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If God exists, then a fully informed pancritical rationalist would have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;absolutely no choice but to believe in It.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you are using "faith" simply to mean the content of a belief system,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Eleizer, then your response is correct. However, I take faith to more</i><br>
<i>&gt; usually refer to the *way* in which a belief is held, i.e, not in</i><br>
<i>&gt; accordance with or sensitive to evidence and reasons. In that sense,</i><br>
<i>&gt; pancritical rationalism is *not* compatible with religious faith.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Max</i><br>
<p>
Although there are undoubtedly fundamentalists who would shriek that Faith<br>
must reign supreme over Reason, there are also sane people, some of them with<br>
doctorates in physics, who would insist that every word of the Old Testament<br>
is unvarnished and unmetaphorical fact.  Many would take offense if you<br>
suggested that their belief is not "in accordance with or sensitive to<br>
evidence and reasons".<br>
<p>
While it is not my intention to intervene in religious disputes at this time -<br>
I feel we'll all know who was right soon enough - I do feel it necessary to<br>
remind everyone that there are sincerely and unapologetically religious<br>
people, who are often involved with charitable issues and generally spread a<br>
little Light around, even if it is in the name of God.  If this seems odd or<br>
inconceivable to you, then treat them with the same respect you would accord<br>
an alien with an incomprehensible philosophy but benign deeds.  There are<br>
minds that think as well as you do, only differently.<br>
