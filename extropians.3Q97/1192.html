This really ignores the essentials of the argument I was making. <br>
<p>
"[A] lot more protection ... ", in comparison to the hegemonic ideas<br>
embodied in society and the judiciary, a la Britain in the 18th and 19th<br>
centuries?  You are not comparing like with like.  And, of course, it is<br>
quite clear that your constitution is NOT secure. Look at the twisted<br>
interpretations used to justify the abandonement of the clear intent of<br>
its Founders. Look at the gradual replacement of its ethos by by new<br>
ideologies, like health fascism (eg guns as an epidemic, victim<br>
disamament as a public health measure etc).   Pointing to the values of<br>
liberty, to common law, to the decisions of a libertarian-oriented<br>
judiciary, to the arguments of constitutional lawyers etc etc is<br>
arguably just as good a start as pointng to a written constitution.  In<br>
order to support your argument (a common one I've heard before from<br>
Americans) you would need to show some awareness of the constitutional<br>
and political history of other countries - something, alas, generally<br>
absent amongst Americans (as evidenced from the initial comments that<br>
started this thread).  <br>
<p>
British liberties were just as extensive and secure as American<br>
(arguably more so in many areas) when libertarian ideas had hegemony in<br>
theory and in social practice.  The US constition has been breached<br>
repeatedly from early times, although most signifcantly more recently.<br>
Once the predomininant beliefs and practices that produced a specific<br>
constitution are undermined or reversed then a constitution is nothing<br>
more than a piece of paper and worthless against either the mob - or the<br>
elite power seeker.  And, of course, a written constitution that isn't<br>
the product of the real forces of society is worthless from the start.<br>
Your constitutional safeguards have now been breached in countless areas<br>
and the likelihood of their virtually total disappearance is now high<br>
(in spite of the renaissance of libertarian ideas, which is probably too<br>
little too late in terms of the power of its intellectual and<br>
political/class enemies).  Indeed, ironically, the coming US statism<br>
which is the precise reverse of the intent of the US constitution will<br>
undoubedly be wrapped up in the forms and rhetoric of the old<br>
libertarian-oriented constitution, in order to preserve legitimacy and<br>
continuity - a sick joke of history.  <br>
<p>
Do read my article for a more complete exposition of this argument.<br>
