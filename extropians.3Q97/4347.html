Its mostly to do with the psychology of trade. Since the overriding<br>
interest of your average person is self interest, the more agressive one<br>
engages in trade, the more likely one is to be motivated by greed (but<br>
in a good way! ;) ). The smell of money tends to make people less<br>
cautious and more optimistic. "I'm going to make it THIS time." is what<br>
the little voice inside says.<br>
<p>
Given this behavior, in a market where parties are less free with<br>
information, more secretive, those without information either have to<br>
pass on a trade opportunity, pull out early, or make a leap, a gamble.<br>
So they either accept lower gains with lower risk, or with secrecy,<br>
accept greater risk for debatably greater gains. Markets fed on<br>
speculation tend to inflate in value beyond true market value if<br>
sufficient information is withheld from the negotiation. Witness the<br>
recent market performance that has accompanied a behavior by major<br>
corporations and trades to generate two sets of data: one for favored<br>
clients, and one for release to the masses. This sort of disinformation<br>
obviously biases the market. The market balloon swells to a point beyond<br>
the confidence of the investor on the street, which can either cause<br>
stagnation, or in a crisis of confidence, cause the balloon to burst,<br>
like the Japanese markets of the early 90's. The market then plunges far<br>
below prices that an informed investor would sell on, but a panicked<br>
uninformed speculator accepts just to escape from the trauma. This is<br>
the sort of positive feedback I speak of. Speculation cycles can occur<br>
in any market, and if enough cycles coincide so as to reinforce each<br>
other, a normally stable economy can be ruined.<br>
