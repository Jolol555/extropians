Dear Admiral Gayler,                      22 April 1997                                 22 April 1995<br>
<p>
<p>
    Thank you so much for speaking with me when I telephoned you from Bristol,<br>
England at your home in Alexandria a few weeks or so back.  I really enjoyed<br>
our conversation so much -- a dream come true; for me anyway!<br>
<p>
<p>
    [I enclose some papers to give you some idea as to 'who I am and where I'm<br>
at' right now; I'm happy to answer any enquiries you may have about me and my<br>
activities.  I promise to try not to inveigle you into my problems over here.<br>
&lt;smile&gt;]<br>
<p>
<p>
    A word on methodology: my approach to problem-solving is basically that of<br>
Karl Popper; and more particularly, Imre Lakatos' proposals in his "The<br>
Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes" (Cambridge, [1978]).  These are<br>
among the most powerful and effective instruments of intellectual weaponry I<br>
know of.  I enclose Bryan Magee's wonderful little book "Popper" as a gift from<br>
me to you; and to 'repay forward' the work you've done already for peace with<br>
freedom.<br>
<p>
    [ I have to admit to sometimes 'speaking through quotations': if others say<br>
what I want said better than I can say it, 'let them fly'! ]<br>
<p>
<p>
    I *don't* start from the problems of the _specific means of warfare_,<br>
important though these are (especially nuclear weapons).  With Heisenberg, I<br>
don't think these are the basic -- or even the worst -- problem:  My primary<br>
concern is with 'The Causes of War' (see Geoffrey Blainey's classic academic<br>
text of this name, publ. Sun Books, Melbourne). Blainey's view (following<br>
analysis of several hundred wars from 1700 to 1971) amounts to the conclusion<br>
that wars arise as a result of faulty intelligence evaluations of one's own or<br>
the other side's interests, aims, strengths and will to fight; wars "usually<br>
begin when two [or more] nations disagree on their relative strength, and wars<br>
usually cease when the fighting nations agree on their relative strength."<br>
<p>
    And I think the problems of disarmament can actually be more readily<br>
resolved long-term by something like the twelve-track strategy I outline here,<br>
with the tracks running separately yet simultaneously, more or less in parallel<br>
(an Integrated Operational Plan for worldwide peace with freedom, if you<br>
like!).  Such a plan incorporates specific advances to general nuclear<br>
disarmament, while (hopefully) avoiding the dangers of open-ended non-nuclear<br>
warfare.  Its central focus is upon what we're fighting for -- and against --<br>
and the means by which we fight; and upon the human and material costs.<br>
<p>
    Still, there are indeed 'no final moves'!<br>

TITLE: "William Hood on war"<br>
<p>
TEXT:  "Like war, spying is a dirty business.  Shed of its alleged glory, a<br>
soldier's job is to kill.  Peel away the claptrap of espionage and the spy's<br>
job is to betray trust.  The only justification a soldier or a spy can have is<br>
the moral worth of the cause he represents."<br>

Weidenfeld's [1982].<br>

<p>
[01] TITLE: 'Values as the expression of the central order'<br>
<p>
TEXT:  'The problem of values is nothing but the problems of our acts, goals<br>
and morals.  It concerns the compass by which we must steer our ship if we  <br>
are to set a true course through life. The compass itself has been given  <br>
different names by various religions and philosophies ... but I have a clear<br>
impression that all such formulations try to express man's relatedness to a<br>
central order.   In the final analysis the central order, or the 'One' as it<br>
used to be called with which we commune in the language of religion, must win<br>
out....<br>
<p>
  If we ask Western man what is good, what is worth striving for and what has<br>
to be rejected, we shall find time and again, that his answers reflect the<br>
ethical norms of Christianity even when he has long since lost all touch with<br>
christian images and parables. If the magnetic force which has guided this<br>
particular compass - and what  else was its source but the central order? -<br>
should ever become extinguished, terrible things may happen to mankind, far<br>
more terrible even than  concentration camps and atom bombs.'<br>
<p>
    Werner Heisenberg, [1971] 'Physics and beyond: encounters and<br>
conversations', published by George Allen and Unwin, London.<br>
<p>
<p>
    Thorpe is emphatic in asserting that we must never forget that such a<br>
conclusion must on no account be attributed solely to the Western insights<br>
stemming from the Christian revelation; he gives the following Admonitions as a<br>
further example, drawn from the Amerindian tribe of the Shawnees (who were<br>
dispossessed of their Oklahoma lands in 1839).<br>
<p>
<p>
TITLE: The Shawnee Admonitions:<br>
<p>
TEXT: (1)  "Do not kill or injure your neigbour, for it is not him you injure,<br>
you injure yourself."<br>
<p>
      (2)  "Do not wrong or hate your neighbour, for it is not him that you<br>
wrong, you wrong yourself.  Moneto, the Supreme Being. loves him also as she<br>
loves you."<br>
<p>
  Quoted from W.H. Thorpe, 'Purpose in a World of Chance' Oxford [1978].<br>
<p>
<p>
    This is clearly related via the central order to the (negative) Judaic<br>
injunction not to do unto one's neighbour that which one would not wish to<br>
befall one's self.  My own -- perhaps agnostic -- orientation is nearer Taoism;<br>
but these ethical principles are capable of reformulation for most spiritual --<br>
and even humanistic or atheistic -- contexts.<br>

[02] TITLE: "The Role of the Sciences"<br>
<p>
TEXT:  I am constantly reminded of the role of the Newtonian foundations in<br>
Kantian ethics.  I do think that the near-destruction of 'Classical Physics'<br>
was a tragedy that broke the self-confident -- Kantian -- foundations of 19th<br>
Century liberal optimism and rational expectations of a better future, and<br>
further opened the door to the barbarism of Prussian militarism, aggressive<br>
racial nationalism, Marxism and National Socialism in the 20th Century.<br>
<p>
    I've spent much of the last 10 years working on a Scentific Research<br>
Programme which is founded on an extended Classical Mechanics, which replaces<br>
SR/GR and QM with an intelligible and accurate integrated Scientific Research<br>
Programme -- Relational Mechanics -- which can be stated on a sheet of A4<br>
paper.  Here's the 'Core Programme' of Relational Mechanics:  There's an<br>
accompanying 120K file which closely argues for the programme on a positive<br>
'balance-sheet' heuristic of clarity, simplicity and accuracy in description,<br>
explanation and prediction.<br>
<p>
<p>
TITLE: A Scientific Research Programme of Relational Mechanics<br>
<p>
TEXT: The basis of Relational Mechanics is the single principle, that the laws<br>
of physics have the same form in all frames of reference in uniform<br>
translation, and are the same everywhere. It extends Classical Mechanics into<br>
the realms presently occupied by Special and General Relativity and Quantum<br>
Mechanics.<br>
<p>
 Dimensional Analysis of Measure Ratios: Mass = M.  Length = L.  Time = T.<br>
<p>
 [1] MATTER IN INFINITE SPACE: Material objects having extension exist in a<br>
space which is without intrinsic properties, and which exists to infinity in<br>
every direction.<br>
<p>
 [2] UNIFORM TIME WITH UNIVERSAL SIMULTANEITY: The elapsing of time is uniform<br>
and unidirectionally forward, with an instantaneous present time which occurs<br>
at the same time - simultaneously - everywhere.  Signal intervals can be<br>
calculated to achieve corrected accurate predictive and retrodictive data.<br>
<p>
 [3] EQUIVALENT GALILEAN RELATIVITY: All forces, material coordinate positions<br>
and velocities are relational; and all co-ordinate systems or frames of<br>
reference in uniform motion relative to one another are Galileian systems.<br>
There is no privileged or "absolute" reference frame.  There is full addition<br>
of velocities across co-ordinate systems or reference frames.<br>
<p>
 [4] GENERALIZATION OF THE LAWS OF MECHANICS: All the laws of mechanics have<br>
the same form in every inertial frame of reference or coordinate system.<br>
<p>
 [5] CLASSICAL MECHANICS: INERTIA: The stasis or movement of anything does not<br>
change unless and until a force acts upon it.<br>
<p>
 [6] CLASSICAL MECHANICS: ACTION: A change in movement of anything is<br>
proportional to the force acting upon it, and is made in the direction of the<br>
force which acts upon it.  (f = ma = ML/T^2; Force = mass times acceleration).<br>
<p>
 [7] CLASSICAL MECHANICS: REACTION: For every action, there is an equal<br>
reaction in the opposite direction.  (f1 = -f2).<br>
<p>
 [8] RELATIONAL GRAVITATIONAL FORCE: The relational gravitational attraction<br>
between massy objects is proportional to the sum of their masses, and is<br>
proportional to the inverse square of the distance between their centres of<br>
mass.  If gravitational force should prove to be propagated at a finite rate,<br>
and objects be moving radially relative to each other, then the additional<br>
velocity-dependent modification for propagated spherical forces, Woldemar<br>
Voight's [1887] equations (later known as "Lorentz Transformations") would be<br>
required, as a first approximation to non-linear equations for delayed<br>
interaction over a distance.<br>
<p>
 [9] RELATIONAL ELECTRIC FORCE: The relational electric attraction or repulsion<br>
between charged objects is inverse-square proportional to the distance between<br>
them.  If electric force proves to be propagated at a finite rate, and objects<br>
be moving relative to each other, then the additional velocity-dependent<br>
modification for propagated spherical forces, Woldemar Voight's [1887]<br>
equations (later known as "Lorentz Transformations") is required, as a first<br>
approximation to non-linear equations for delayed interaction over a distance.<br>
<p>
    Coulomb's Law and Voight's equations yield Maxwell's equations without<br>
further assumptions, as proved by Leigh Page, Yale Professor of Mathematical<br>
Physics [1912] and [1913].<br>

 [10] RELATIONAL MAGNETIC FORCE: The relational magnetic attraction or<br>
repulsion between north and south magnets is inverse-square proportional to the<br>
distance between them.  If magnetic force proves to be propagated at a finite<br>
rate, and objects be moving radially relative to each other, then the<br>
additional velocity-dependent modification for propagated spherical forces,<br>
Woldemar Voight's [1887] equations (later known as "Lorentz Transformations")<br>
would be required, as a first approximation to non-linear equations for delayed<br>
interaction over a distance.<br>
<p>
    The lines of magnetic force follow from the force interactions described by<br>
Poisson's equations.<br>

 [11] QUANTIZED MASS AND ENERGY VALUE OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION:<br>
Electromagnetic structures which are radiated and absorbed ('photons') have<br>
intrinsic mass, and this mass occurs in in multiples of a minimum mass.  This<br>
mass, when in linear translation and with up to three axes of classical<br>
rotation, ('spins') as well as three degrees of vibration, gives rise to<br>
quantum effects.  Such electromagnetic structures ('photons') are made from the<br>
same material as other forms of matter - negatively charged microparticles<br>
(which we can call electrinos); positively-charged microparticles, (which we<br>
may call positrinos).  There are also neutral microparticles, (presently called<br>
neutrinos).<br>
<p>
 In free space the velocity of emittance of a radiated photon _relative to its<br>
source_ is constant at L/T = 299,792.485 + or - .0012 km/second.<br>
<p>
 E = hv, where E is the energy value of the photon; v is its frequency; and h<br>
is Planck's constant, which has the measure-ratio of ML^2/T, and is presently<br>
calculated as 6.6262 x 10^-34 Joules/second.  There is accordingly a lower as<br>
well as an upper limit to photon size.  Relevant equations may be found in R.A.<br>
Waldron, [1977] and [1982].<br>
<p>
 These quantized electromagnetic structures, in conjunction with Beckmann's<br>
[1987] theory of electron orbits, provide the basis for developing the<br>
quantized dynamics of particle systems, including atoms and molecules.<br>

 [12] CONSERVATION LAWS: There is full conservation of mass; full conservation<br>
of energy over time; and full conservation of momentum.  Mass is invariant with<br>
respect to relative velocities, as are length and time.<br>

[03] TITLE: "The Role of Philosopy in the Furtherance of Open Societies"<br>
<p>
    Popper's "The Open Society and Its Enemies" is a basic text, as is his<br>
[1994] "The Myth Of the Framework."  Tarski's Correspondence theory of truth is<br>
central; and Lakatos and Musgrave [1976] is also 'essential reading', as is<br>
John Hospers' fine book 'An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis.  And even<br>
David Carradine's fine book 'The Spirit of Shaolin' &lt;smiles&gt;.<br>

[04] TITLE: "The Role of the Arts"<br>
<p>
TEXT: "They were wrong, and they will always be wrong, those prophets who say<br>
Art will degenerate, will exhaust all conceivable forms, will die.  It is we<br>
who will die; Art will remain.  And shall we -- before we perish -- manage to<br>
understand all its facets and all its purposes?<br>
<p>
    Not everything has a name.  Some things lead us into a realm beyond words. <br>
Art thaws even the frozen, darkened soul, opening it to lofty spiritual<br>
experience.  Through Art we are sometimes sent -- indistinctly, briefly --<br>
revelations not to be achieved by rational thought.<br>
<p>
    It is like that small mirror in the fairy-tales -- you glance in it, and<br>
what you see is not yourself: for an instant, you glimpse the Inaccessible,<br>
where no horse or magic carpet can take you.  And the soul cries out for it..."<br>

[05] TITLE: "Realizing Human Potential"<br>
<p>
TEXT:  I'm working intermittently on a -- shareware -- personal computer<br>
programme which offers some of the benefits of the Human Potential methods,<br>
inexpensively, on a more widespread basis.  There is quite a lot of interest in<br>
such technologies nowadays.  The work of LTC Jim Channon's 'First Earth<br>
Battalion Foundation' is also well worth a look; as is the generality of work<br>
done on the realization of Human Potential described in Pearson &amp; Shaw's book<br>
"Life Extension -- A Practical Scientific Approach"; and "MegaBrain" by Michael<br>
Hutchison.  [Also Jose Silva's 'Silva Mind Control Method.']<br>

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------<br>
<p>
[06] TITLE: "The Open Society and its Enemies"<br>
<p>
TEXT: Popper's work, again; I've developed a simple programme -- Democratic<br>
Agorism -- which aims to provide both assessment benchmarks and practical<br>
measures to achieve more fully free and open societies worldwide.  And Open<br>
Societies don't war with each other...<br>

<p>
[07] TITLE: "Wars of Ideas; Wars on Ideas"<br>
<p>
TEXT:  As Popper says (The Myth Of The Framework), civilization really started<br>
with the invention of swords.  Civilized and intelligent men then saw that<br>
fighting with words makes better sense, with bad ideas dying instead of people.<br>
<p>
    So I support wars of ideas waged on behalf of the ideas of the Open<br>
Society, backed with:<br>
<p>
    Triple-track diplomacy (positive, negative and covert-action);<br>
<p>
    Psychological warfare (viz. Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger's classic text of<br>
that name: did you ever meet him?);<br>
<p>
    Special Forces (viz. "Swords of Lightning" by Terry White; publ. Brassey's,<br>
[1992];<br>
<p>
    Reactive 'Antiweaponry' Defences (PGMs, conventional antiballistic missile<br>
systems -- viz. the _original_ "High Frontier" ideas in Dan Graham's Heritage<br>
Foundation Project Book of that name [1982], not the hyped-up SDI stuff that<br>
dissipated the money and the political support which could have built High<br>
Frontier's Layered Defense proposals.  <br>
<p>
    I would ask you to please consider the "High Frontier" proposals<br>
independently of your experience of Dan Graham:  I was impressed by the way he<br>
welcomed a visiting Soviet journalist to a High Frontier presentation in<br>
London, and emphasised how the US and the USSR could work together to block<br>
nuclear attack.  You and he do _seem_ to share many ideals, while differing<br>
profoundly over means.  And you're both feisty and combative people!<br>
<p>
    (Some of our MoD and conservative people were averse to Strategic Defense<br>
ideas because they feared the nullification of Britain's 'independent<br>
deterrent':  yet our Trident systems rely on American know-how for accuracy;<br>
and I'll not soon forget my Royal Navy friend Peter McManus -- later a 'Top<br>
Gun' trainer 'on loan' to RAF Valley in the late Sixties -- telling me of the<br>
terse reply they were given at their fighter-bomber mission briefing, when<br>
someone asked how they were supposed to get 'back home' again, when the nuclear<br>
targets were at the Scimitar's limits of range: "What do you think there will<br>
be to come home to"?).<br>
<p>
<p>
    The aim of this sort of twelve-part Integrated Operational Plan should be<br>
to fight and win the war of ideas *peacefully* for the Open Societies,<br>
transforming enemies into friends wherever this may be possible.<br>
<p>
                      ----------- * * * * * -----------<br>
<p>
[08] TITLE: "Horizontal Spontanous Social Orders"<br>
<p>
TEXT:  My preference is for the sorts of damage-resistant, adaptive and<br>
resilient 'horizontal' free and equalitarian social orders envisioned by (most<br>
of) the Lockean founders of the American Republic. (If a quiet patriotism is<br>
the love of the _idea_ of a country, I'm certainly a North American!  I'm<br>
applying for political refugee status in Canada right now -- see attached<br>
document).<br>
<p>
<p>
[09] TITLE: "Globalized Free Communications Networks"<br>
<p>
    Lots of Internets, with lots of alternative telecomms providers! <br>
Spontaneous orders then form from the free chices made by the individual<br>
telecommunicators.  David Andrews' book "The IRG Solution: Hierarchical<br>
Incompetence and How To Overcome It" (Souvenir Press, [1984]) gives good<br>
insights into these social processes.<br>

TEXT: In 1944, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation ran this magazine<br>
advertisement,showing a grim pilot, about to take on Zeros at twelve o'clock,<br>
imagining this staccato message to his wife:-<br>
<p>
    "I want to tell you what I'm fighting for.. it's you and our little house<br>
and the job I had before... and the chance I had, the fighting chance, to go<br>
ahead on my own.  That's what all of us want out here... to win this war... to<br>
get home... To go back to living our lives in a land -- and a world -- where<br>
*every* man is free to grow as great as he's a mind to be... where every man<br>
has an *unlimited* opportunity to be useful to himself and his fellow men...<br>
Tell 'em we'll be back... nothing can stop us... And tell 'em no matter what<br>
they say, no matter what they do... to stay *free*.. to keep America a land of<br>
*individual freedom*! That's what we're fighting for... That's what we're<br>
willing to die for... That's the America we want when we come home."<br>

    [a] Offices of Open Network (like Leif Smith's in Colorado - I have a copy<br>
of their interesting 60pp Operating Manual available).<br>
<p>
    [b] Information Exchanges (like CIX here in England - runs under COSY)<br>
<p>
<p>
    [c] Credit Unions (like Grameen Bank and North American CUs)<br>
<p>
<p>
    [d] Local Exchange Trading Systems (to 'kickstart' economic activity where<br>
people have little or no money).  Start-up books are available.<br>
<p>
<p>
    [e] WishCraft Centres:  Non-injurious 'wishes' are described on record<br>
cards or computer record entries in this simple format:<br>
<p>
    TITLE: &lt;five or six words&gt;;<br>
    TEXT: 50 to 100 word description;<br>
    CONTACT: preferred contact mode or address<br>
<p>
    Participants then work to realize the wishes for each other.<br>

[12] TITLE: "The Role Of Mythologies"<br>
<p>
    Science fiction has been aptly described as 'The Mythology of the 20th (and<br>
21st) Century.  Foremost among my favourites are Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings'<br>
(in which coercion is the main evil, and individual free will is the foundation<br>
of the principal virtues).  And Cordwainer Smith's incomparable stories (Dr.<br>
Paul Linebarger's nom de plume)<br>

    I hope you find these ideas worthy of your consideration and further<br>
discussion;  I'm really looking forward to hearing from you!  I'm entirely<br>
happy for you to discuss all this with others if you think it's worthwhile.  I<br>
have no secrets from the Puzzle Palace!! &lt;smile&gt;<br>

    All Best Wishes,<br>

POSTSCRIPT: On all this 'Rightist Kooks and Commies' 'n Stuff...  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
A senior professor at Bristol University says I'm quite sane, if a little <br>
over-stressed.<br>
<p>

Medical Council _at their request&gt;) tried to get me 'committeed' over the <br>
last fortninght.  Case number 1997/1227.<br>
<p>
My examining medics say I'm a nice guy ( &gt;:-} ) quite sane, and brilliantly <br>
intelligent, albeit a bit isolated. &gt;:-{<br>

PPS: True story...<br>
<p>
I was standing at my living-room window  a couple days back, reflecting with a focussed intensity on how to deal with the problems.<br>
<p>
 Suddenly, a brilliant blue-and-gold flash of lightning struck just 1000 <br>
 yards away, followed by an earth-shaking thunderclap.<br>

<p>
Then the sky suddely darkened, and a hard rain fell.<br>
