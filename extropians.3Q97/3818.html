<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I believe that the American Association of Independant Investors (I</i><br>
<i>&gt;*think* that's the name) can point you in the right direction.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I looked into investing directly not too long ago. <br>
<p>
In general, anyone with a clean background can get the licenses necessary to<br>
trade directly.  *However*, the SEC will not give you the licenses unless<br>
you can<br>
essentially guarantee the SEC that you (or your group) can attract a<br>
significant amount investment capital.  The<br>
exact amount is fuzzy, but I am told that it is generally in the $10<br>
million range.<br>
<p>
Therefore, it would theoretically be possible for several modestly wealthy<br>
individuals to pool enough investment<br>
capital to convince the SEC to let them trade as equals with the brokerage<br>
firms under some arbitrary nomer.<br>
<p>
<p>

<i>&gt;&gt;small chunks?  In other words, wouldn't it make more sense if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;economy wuld allow invesment in increments of penny's?  For example, I</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;non-fluid restriction and one that favors the rich investor over the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;poor one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is no way that I know of to buy sub-shares.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Merrill-Lynch used to let you buy sub-shares (in units of 1/10000 sh.) a<br>
long time back, but they<br>
ended the program several years ago.  Probably wasn't profitable for them.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The phenomenon you mention is exactly why stocks tend to rise after they</i><br>
<i>&gt;split: the split causes greater liquidity.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
My personal opinion is that the sudden growth in perceived value is<br>
partially due to the fact that <br>
the cheaper price creates an illusion of "a good deal".  Similar to the<br>
"$19.95" vs. "$20" phenomenon in stores.<br>
The small surge in demand for the "good deal" drives real value up.<br>
<p>
Also, some investors, especially amateurs, confuse "stock price" with<br>
"stock value".  Shares are infinitely divisible and the only implicit value<br>
they have is with respect to the total shares currently issued.<br>
