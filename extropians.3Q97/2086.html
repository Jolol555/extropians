I suspect that the available mass in the solar system is a<br>
constraint on the near-term complexity of our sucessor<br>
civilization, whether that's us, as transhumans, or some<br>
integrated SI. The Sun, of course, constitures nearly all<br>
of the available mass.<br>
<p>
I suspect that we can derive the greatest amount fo computational<br>
power per mass by converting as much mass as we can to neutonium.<br>
By the tine we know how to do that, we'll also know how to build<br>
nurtonium nanotech. The reason that neutronium computers are faster<br>
is that they are a lot smaller, so the internal signals don't<br>
have to travel as far. The speed-of light delay has always been<br>
an important constraint on supercomcuter speeds, and is now<br>
becoming important on workstations. Other things being equal(!)<br>
a neutonium computer should be thousands to millions of times<br>
faster than a computer of the same mass made of normal atoms.<br>
<p>
Of course, we still need to use some of the mass for power,<br>
and we'll want to minimize the wastage so as to maximize the<br>
amount of neutronium we'll have available, but these are<br>
trivial engineering details for our sucessor civilization<br>
to worry about.<br>
