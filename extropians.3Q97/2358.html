Quoth EvMick,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not that I'm expressing any value judgements...in fact I could argue that</i><br>
<i>&gt; children are the property of their parents until "coming of age"...to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; treated...disposed of ..or not as to the discrestion of the parent...in fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; it could be argued that that would have to be the libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; position...otherwise we're all slaves to the state.</i><br>
<p>
Lots of things can be argued, but the notion that children, arbitrarily<br>
defined, are either chattel of the parents or chattel of the state, and<br>
that the former view "would have to be the libertarian position" is <br>
seriously troubling to me.<br>
<p>
I'd like to believe that some system could come into being where a person<br>
of whatever age who demonstrates ability to self govern is invited to do<br>
so... but demonstrates to whom? and when? and how? ...with what appeal?<br>
<p>
The issue is one that I find very sticky. <br>
And I am no great lover of the State.<br>
<p>
It's a good thing you're not saying that. :)<br>

<i>&gt; But I'm not saying that....now.</i><br>
