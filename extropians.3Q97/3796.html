Re Eli/drugs:<br>
<p>
Justified or not, I have painted the following low-res picture of<br>
Eli's emotional landscape regarding this topic:  Concentration camps<br>
and crack neighborhoods are both horrifyingly ugly and disturbing.<br>
It's too late for me to do anything about the Holocaust, but I can<br>
and *will* do something about the crack neighborhoods.<br>
<p>
A worthwhile endeavor -- suffering and death are to be avoided and<br>
if possible eliminated.  I don't think destroying cocaine will work,<br>
though.  People suffering from withdrawal will find other drugs, and<br>
there are many to choose from.  Attempting to destroy them all seems<br>
the long way around at best.  Even making withdrawal painless may<br>
not help, because the drugs came in to fill a void.  Until the void<br>
is filled with knowledge, hope, and a feeling of self-worth, people<br>
will continue to fill it with less healthy things.<br>
