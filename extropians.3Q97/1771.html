The Mandelbrot Set never repeats itself exactly and it's been proven that  <br>
the boundary line of it is as convoluted and random as it is possible for a  <br>
line drawn on a flat surface to be.  We know for sure that the shape of <br>
The Mandelbrot Set is infinitely complex, we don't know for sure that <br>
anything about a grape is infinitely complex. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Going deeply into a grape, however, you run into, well, unknown         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;things. Who knows what's down in there? Superstrings? Membranes?        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;What? </i><br>
             <br>
<p>
But is complexity really the issue here?  You seem to be saying that  <br>
The Mandelbrot Set is not real because it's not complex enough, Hara was <br>
saying it's not real because it's too complex.<br>
