hmmm...should I be insulted?  Maybe you could elaborate on the statement :<br>
"the failure of corporations or governments to remove fixed and<br>
unaviodable costs from the variable cost data used by product lines or<br>
households to price their products and services in a competitive market"?<br>
I'm older than ten, and I don't know what you're saying.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; but has been</i><br>
<i>&gt; treated as an act of God in the media, in our schools, and on the internet;</i><br>
<i>&gt; while the industrial nations have rested content with 5-25% unemployment and</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2-3% sustained inflation, since the 1890's. </i><br>
<p>
Well, I'd say my country(Canada) is an industrial nation, and no one here<br>
is content with 5-25% unemployment(10% to be precise)  It has been one<br>
of the primary platform issues in the last two federal elections.<br>
