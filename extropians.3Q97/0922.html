<p>
The Extropian is IMO dedicated to the advancement of humanity, that<br>
is to the idea of improvement. Pseudo-science is a serious diversion,<br>
in several ways. It's perfectly acceptable to invoke new physics,<br>
but you must do so explicitly. Otherwise, you are simply exploring<br>
an alternate universe that has no relationship to the improvement<br>
of humanity.<br>
   Topics that I have no interest in include:<br>
 Roswell (would require an unrealistically large conspiracy)<br>
 Abrupt pole shift (violates law of conservation of angular momentum)<br>
<p>
In general, I simply skip this garbage without reading it.<br>
