Anton:<br>
: &gt; Wanna know what made me sick?  Seeing Harlan Ellison (a Jew) on<br>
: &gt; _Politically Incorrect_ defending one of the FBI's famous recent<br>
: &gt; slaughters of the differently-opinionated.<br>
<p>
Eliezer:<br>
: They violated the no-racial-hatred taboo.<br>
<p>
That fits if he was talking about the Weavers (though the Weavers <br>
were no threat to anybody); but after all this time I'm not sure <br>
he wasn't talking about the Branch Davidians, of whom only half <br>
were White.  But one can't expect an ordinary person like Harlan <br>
Ellison to know that inconvenient fact.<br>
<p>
And I'm not sure that the Weavers actually *hated* Blacks; one <br>
might have other (crackpot) reasons for believing that God wants <br>
the races to be separated.  But one can't expect an ordinary person <br>
like Harlan Ellison to grasp such a subtlety.<br>
<p>
Harlan's error was believing Morris Dees (a.k.a. Klanwatch).  <br>
Anybody that Morris Dees doesn't like is a Jew-hater, and it is <br>
righteous to slay Jew-haters even unto the least of them.<br>
<p>
Er, excuse me, I seem to have pushed my own button.<br>
