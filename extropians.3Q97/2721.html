In a message dated 97-09-01 10:03:56 EDT, in response to an earlier post of<br>
mine you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I'd love to play with this stuff with the goal of replacing the<br>
 electric pumps with rankin or stirling engines using a working<br>
 fluid with a vapor temp in the corrrect range, and using solar<br>
 boost. I suspect that this is feasible, but its not economical<br>
 for me: I work for a living. However, consider the implications<br>
 for when nanotech is available. You can get all the energy you<br>
 need for heating and cooling by running a closed-loop pipe in<br>
 the ground, horizontally or vertically, about 200 feet of pipe<br>
 per 1000 square feet of living space. A bit more pipe for<br>
 domestic water heating, maybe a bit more to power the system and<br>
 to boost for cooking. the remainder of your current domestic<br>
 power demand is near zero. So, nanotech frees you from the<br>
 power grid.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
All Right!!  So it IS possible?  Only minute amounts of power...but in<br>
principle it'spossible...<br>
<p>
It seems to me the problem is then to improve the effeciency of the<br>
mechanisms as much as possible...possibly as you implied...nanothech<br>
materials tech.<br>
<p>
I work for a living too....It sure would be nice though to have the<br>
disposable income...and the time...to fool around with stuff likethis.<br>
