I am absolutely delighted that finally, finally the acknowledgement<br>
"creativity" as an important component of our future is being recognized in<br>
more than one field. <br>
Dr Stephen Thaler's approach is a milestone in achieving strides in AI,<br>
however the article itself does make assumptions that are debatable.  <br>
<p>
It is my view that in the future, near and far, that "creativity" will be<br>
understood and appreciated more than ever.   This includes not only the<br>
psychological ramifications of creativity, but also the practical<br>
applications of creativity as being as vital in our thinking as intelligence<br>
is.  The "Creativity Augmentum" in the 21st Century, as I see it, will<br>
certainly be worth investing in.<br>
