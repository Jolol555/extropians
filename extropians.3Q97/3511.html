[This week I have read the threads generated by Holly Pearson's original post<br>
with great interest and, until they spawned such a large volume of<br>
discussion, the intent to make a detailed response and comment on the entire<br>
discussion.  At this point that volume has grown so large that detailed<br>
quoting would consume all of my available writing time, so please excuse the<br>
lack of attribution and inevitable redundancy . . .]<br>
<p>
First, a comment on nomenclature and rhetoric (and one I know others have<br>
made).  The misuse of the words "Nazi" and "fascist" is a pet peeve of mine.<br>
 The Nazis were near the bottom of any spectrum of morality one can distill<br>
from a study of human history.  Fascism has a specific meaning in a rigorous<br>
discussion of politics: Elitist -- usually ethnically based -- statist,<br>
nationalistic totalitarianism.  Applying those terms where they don't belong<br>
debases the currency of political and moral dialogue.  There is an undeniable<br>
tenancy in leftist rhetoric to apply the term "fascist" to any mode of<br>
thought or action that doesn't endorse coercive income redistribution.  That<br>
same school of rhetoric uses the inflammatory epithet "Nazi" somewhat less<br>
indiscriminately, but nonetheless almost uniformly in an unjustified manner.<br>
 Unless one is discussing a party of armed psychopathic bigots intent on<br>
world-scale violence with a program of pseudoscientific eugenics, the word<br>
"Nazi" is hyperbole of a sort that does no credit to a writer.<br>
<p>
Now, on to my two cents' worth.  Misperception of classical liberals,<br>
libertarians, anarcho-capitalists, transhumanists and extropians as<br>
myopically selfish and uncaring is a real threat to the power of our ideas.<br>
 One of the real contributions of extropian ethical thinking has been the<br>
melding of insights about the evolutionary value of cooperative<br>
life-strategies with classical capitalist values.  What distinguishes<br>
extropians from our classical liberal and anarchist intellectual forbearers<br>
is our realization that sentient beings must find a moral and ethical<br>
framework that can withstand the utter transformation of the material<br>
circumstances of human life and the complete mutability of the self.  <br>
<p>
To put it in game-theoretic terms, we are impressed by the apparent truth<br>
that reflexive defectors have low survival value in any social system<br>
requiring trade or in which cooperative action yields competitive advantage.<br>
 At the other end of the spectrum, we see that reflexive cooperators reap<br>
equally unsatisfactory results from any iterated interaction.  A middle<br>
strategy -- known by the charming schoolyard term, "tit-for-tat" -- appears<br>
to be the optimal strategy in essentially any social situation.<br>
<p>
This somewhat abstract realization bears out millennia of human wisdom and<br>
common sense: An ethic of transparent reciprocity seems to arise<br>
spontaneously from the very fabric of the natural world of actors in society.<br>
 It so happens -- not surprisingly -- that an open marketplace of maximally<br>
free individual actors is the ideally best structure for optimizing each<br>
individual's potential.  From this realizations, extropians come to endorse<br>
agoric systems wherever possible as not only the most efficient, but also the<br>
BEST way of life in any moral sense one can reconcile with a scientific view<br>
of reality.<br>
<p>
This leads to the question Holly Pearson poses: What place, in this world, do<br>
values of kindness and charity have?  One simple and direct answer is that a<br>
reputation for reciprocal kindness is very valuable to an individual.  Being<br>
good is good for you.  Or, to put it in terms of game theory, being KNOWN as<br>
good is good for you, in most instances -- the exception being that one<br>
should also be known to be FAIR and RECIPROCAL, i.e. a reputation for<br>
completely unqualified charity is ultimately bad for you.<br>
<p>
How do these ideas and values translate into the transhuman and posthuman<br>
world?  First, all but the most egocentric of us expect that we will continue<br>
to live our lives somewhere along a spectrum of capability, i.e. in at least<br>
some aspects of our lives -- no matter how long or augmented -- our<br>
individual power, wealth and knowledge will be greater than that of some<br>
individuals and less than others.  We will need to cooperate -- trade -- with<br>
moral entities both more and less powerful than ourselves, and we will need<br>
to do so on an ongoing basis.  In fact, as immortalists, we expect that we<br>
will do so on an indefinitely extended basis.  It will be a very long game,<br>
indeed.  And throughout this game, our moral reputations will be just as<br>
important as the specifics of any isolated trade within any such hierarchy of<br>
capabilities.<br>
<p>
When you interact with others over only the brief span of three score and ten<br>
years, and expect that only a very limited amount of movement through any<br>
hierarchy of capabilities will be possible over that time period, one may be<br>
unkind or "unreciprocal" ("defect", in game theoretic terms) quite a few<br>
times, and expect to get away with it over the anticipated term of the game.<br>
 But where the game may go on indefinitely and the weak may transcend to<br>
unimaginably higher powers in the future, one takes a somewhat different<br>
view: The disenfranchised person to whom I am cruel today may be the demi-god<br>
of next century, able to exact a revenge of proportions I cannot imagine now.<br>
 Even if the specific person to whom I am cruel now is extinguished, an<br>
immortal reputation for unkindness will be a significant handicap in<br>
transactions -- whether purely economic or not -- with entities who do<br>
persist and transcend.<br>
<p>
All of which leads to an idea I have been cultivating for some time and for<br>
which, I gladly admit, Anton Sherwood has found a term for which I have been<br>
looking: "Extrosattva".  The more I think about transhumanism and<br>
extropiansim, the more I am struck by the rich moral raw material to be found<br>
in classical Hinduism and Buddhism.  As we know, the boddisattva is, for want<br>
of a better term, the Buddhist "saint"; the transcended (or almost<br>
transcended) individual who "hangs back" from complete nirvana to assist<br>
others in the process of enlightenment and transcendence.  (If memory serves,<br>
the person of the boddisattva is the defining difference between classical<br>
hinayan and mahayana Buddhism, the former largely ignoring the possibility of<br>
assistance on the road to transcendence.)  Further, the classical Hindu<br>
concept of "karma" makes great sense as an encapsulation of the wisdom of an<br>
ethic of reciprocal kindness in an essentially eternally-iterated prisoner's<br>
dilemma game.  <br>
<p>
I have always imagined the boddisattva as one for whom kindness is no burden,<br>
because of the liberation of the enlightenment that she has experienced.<br>
 Freed from the illusion of the immutability of one's own consciousness, one<br>
is free to help others at little cost to one's self.  Consider how this image<br>
translates to a conception of a post-human "Power": With complete mastery<br>
over material reality through advanced nanotechnology and intelligence<br>
augmentation, how simple it becomes to help others.  Not every transcended<br>
Power would devote effort to such endeavors, just as every newly-enlightened<br>
buddha doesn't hang back from nirvana to assist others less enlightened.  But<br>
that some will seems inevitable.  For instance, the concept inherent in<br>
cryonics that the first-revived will devote themselves -- at least in part --<br>
to reviving the rest, is entirely consistent with this image of rational<br>
charity.  I hope that any here who may pass the threshold before me will<br>
remember this post.<br>
