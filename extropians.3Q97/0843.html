Yes, that's one of the peculiarities. We human apes seem rather<br>
better suited to an aquatic environment than most land mammals<br>
(look how much money Californians spend on swimming pools, for<br>
instance ;), and our closest relatives, the other apes, seem rather<br>
less well suited to an aquatic environment than most land mammals.<br>
Human beings also have a dive reflex built into the neurological<br>
wiring that controls our breathing, similar to the dive reflex<br>
found in pinnipeds, cetaceans, and other aquatic mammals. This dive<br>
reflex (and voluntary control of the breath) seems to be missing<br>
from our ape cousins, whose breathing seems to be as automatic and<br>
involuntary as their heartbeat.<br>
<p>
The Aquatic phase of human evolution, unfortunately, falls into<br>
the "Fossil Gap" that lies between Lucy (the first fully bipedal<br>
human ancestor, and apparently the immediate successor to the<br>
Aquatic Ape, if such a thing ever existed) and the earlier common<br>
ancestors of the modern pongid apes (including Homo), whose existence<br>
is almost as poorly documented in the fossil record as the existence<br>
of any hypothetical wading hominids is.<br>
<p>
FFI <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5168/aat.html">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5168/aat.html</a>, which is not<br>
very academically oriented, but has the best available (that I<br>
could find) single collection of links to a few sites and cites<br>
that are academically oriented.<br>
<p>
(And then there is the curious fact (?) that newborn human infants<br>
know how to swim, and can apparently keep themselves alive without<br>
difficulty in an aquatic environment, although the skill is lost<br>
-- unless practiced? -- within a few weeks. I'm looking for further<br>
recorded evidence of this.  I have seen video footage of swimming<br>
human infants, though.)<br>
