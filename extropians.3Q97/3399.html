     Death is emancipatory? You have thrown off your shackles and can<br>
     run off into the wild, blue yonder? I can't help but think that death <br>
     is the final chaining of my personal evolution. I view death as a<br>
     challenge. If not overcomeable (though this remains to be seen), then <br>
     at the very least an impetus to personal action today -- not now, but <br>
     right now. Okay, so you are right in a way. Death is indeed <br>
     emancipatory -- it frees you from the obligation to grow more complex.<br>

     <br>
     That is only true if one regards physicality as the only avenue down <br>
     which to evolve.  I regard physicality a conduit through which to <br>
     experience the physical world.  With all our talks about galaxy <br>
     brains, multiple dimensions, etc.., how could one not be considering <br>
     an existence far beyond that which is biological and physical?  The <br>
     parallel for me is a kindergartner talking about what they "want to <br>
     be" when they "grow up".  It's hard to be philosophic and extropian <br>
     and I'm decidedly the former...but I do enjoy the company and banter.<br>
