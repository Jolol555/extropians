     Unless you can demonstrate that your parents were forced to inhale the<br>
     noxious fumes of demon weed..(How Long was the literature available?  <br>
     Do YOU beleive everything an Advertiser says?).then I say it was their<br>
     choice...(kinda obvious?)..a BAD choice...but sometimes people make <br>
     bad decesions...and suffer because of it.<br>
     <br>
     Being free is tough...it means you have to be responsible for your own<br>
     actions.  And benifit or suffer because of them.<br>
     <br>
     You make good choices you might be another Bill Gates.<br>

     <br>
     Cars have been embraced culturally as a necessity, we blindly accept <br>
     the potential hazards (not only of the injury that can result while <br>
     traveling in them but the environmental hazards of the good ol' <br>
     internal combustion engine).  Obviously, car safety is on a lot of <br>
     peoples' minds these last couple of weeks due to the Princess Di thing <br>
     (at least in Northern California that seems to be the case...).  <br>
     Everything from photographers to drunk drivers to the lack of guard <br>
     rails in the tunnel has been attributed.  <br>
     <br>
     Cars are an excellent example of the personal and environmental hit <br>
     we're willing to take for the luxury of traveling faster than we can <br>
     go.  I always use cars as an example when people come up quivering <br>
     over progress (like biotech for example, that spooks folks) I ask them <br>
     "Did you walk to work today?"<br>
     <br>
     My parents fall into the intellectually and emotionally stunted group <br>
     of people if they were ongoingly willing to stay addicted to a toxic <br>
     substance.  But when you have a future governor/president touting <br>
     Chesterfield Kings and doctors saying it was good for you and EVERYONE <br>
     doing it, and that type of mentality went on for years and years, <br>
     well, I guess old habits die hard.  Even now when I see a "Got Milk?" <br>
     or a "Meat, it's what you want" or "Pork, the new white meat" ad, I <br>
     have to wonder how soon before those habits become associated only <br>
     with the ill-informed and uncaring for their own health and the <br>
     distribution of resources.<br>
     <br>
     And as far as being another Bill Gates, if *I* were worth that much <br>
     money, I'd look fabulous!  Give that man a makeover for Chrissake!  <br>
     Blech!<br>
     <br>
     My personal jury is still out on dying.  It would be a crushing blow <br>
     to those that know and love me (hard as that may be for one or two of <br>
     you to swallow) but I still regard it as emancipatory.  Guess that <br>
     "deathist" meme's still stuck in my old-fashioned head.  Until more <br>
     profund logic combined with instinctual knowing supersedes it, it's <br>
     staying there and no anxiety is attached to it these days.<br>
     <br>
