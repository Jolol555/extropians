Unfortunately, I don't think that there is any such generic law.<br>
There is a recent trend to use "graphology" as part of the<br>
hiring decision. Graphology is a pseudoscience whose practioners<br>
claim to be able to determine personality traits of the writer<br>
of a handwriting sample, based not on the words but on how the<br>
letters are formed. We also use lie detectors, even though<br>
studies have shown them to be completely unreliable.<br>
