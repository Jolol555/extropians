[Delayed by a couple of days by the NSI DNS disaster.]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From: Sarah Marr &lt;sarah.marr@dial.pipex.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There will, I believe, come a point in my life when I choose to raise a</i><br>
<i>&gt; child with a (female) partner of my choice; and it is highly likely that</i><br>
<i>&gt; she will bear the child. This being the case, and my being</i><br>
<i>&gt; spermatozoically-challenged (the current PC phrase, I suspect), does anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; have any hard facts about the possibility of my genes being used to replace</i><br>
<i>&gt; those in the sperm of an anonymous donor, resulting in a child of which I</i><br>
<i>&gt; am a true parent?</i><br>
<p>
I'd say that the odds are very high that, with enough investment, this<br>
would be possible without any massive technical breakthroughs.<br>
HOWEVER, at the moment it would be damned expensive. For more on that,<br>
see the bottom of the message.<br>
<p>
The usual concept -- that of fusing egg cells or at least their<br>
nucleii -- has been tried. It doesn't work.<br>
<p>
Howver, the recent Scottish sheep cloning work leads to some hope in<br>
this regard.<br>
<p>
There are two parts required here -- conducting some sort<br>
of artificial meiosis and recombination, and then getting the<br>
resultant set of recombined genes into an ovum in such a way that you<br>
start to get an embryo out of the process.<br>
<p>
Now, I'm not sure how to do both of these, but we now know how to do<br>
half of the problem for sure, and there is a possible way to do the<br>
other half.<br>
<p>
To do the recombination is fairly easy conceptually, although I don't<br>
believe anyone has actually tried it in practice.<br>
<p>
Although your chromosomes are usually floating about minding their own<br>
business in an unravelled state, mitosis causes your chromosomes to<br>
bunch up into nice easy parcels. With the aid of some fairly<br>
conventional tools, it should be possible to physically extract<br>
chromosome pairs from a cell in mid-mitosis, use enzymes to break<br>
the centromeres, and extract one chromosome from each pair of a cell.<br>
<p>
Then, given 23 chromosomes from you, and 23 from your partner, you<br>
could conduct mix and match in the laboratory. Admittedly you don't<br>
get crossover, but who cares? (As an aside, you could use this<br>
technique to have a child of more than two parents -- even fourty six<br>
parents.)<br>
<p>
Now, the chromsomes have to be re-implanted in an appropriate somatic<br>
cell so you can get growth and division so you have lots of cells for<br>
the next step. Unfortunately, the one problem is that what you end up<br>
with after nuclear reimplantation of the chromosomes isn't necessarily<br>
a viable cell. To my knowledge, the experiment hasn't yet been done<br>
(though it may have been). However, if you started with chromosomes<br>
from two individuals from the same kind of somatic cell -- say<br>
skeletal muscle cells -- and re-implanted into somatic cells of that<br>
type from one of the individuals -- a viable cell might<br>
result. Certainly getting this part to work is a matter for research,<br>
but it isn't entirely outlandish to think that it could work.<br>
<p>
Luckily, this is the only major problem. Given a cell of this type, we<br>
know what the rest of the procedure has to be.<br>
<p>
The other part of the problem is, of course, to turn the resultant<br>
recombined cell into a viable embryo. Luckily, we've had a<br>
breakthrough in this recently.  One could presumably use the Scottish<br>
method to induce a quiescent state in the somatic cells resulting from<br>
the previous step, and then use the resulting nucleii for nuclear<br>
implantation into an egg cell donated by either you or your partner.<br>
<p>
(I would suggest that you not use a third party's egg cell if you want<br>
for whatever reason to retain the "family mitochondrial<br>
DNA". Admittedly this is merely a sentimental consideration, but is<br>
that not, in fact, what this whole operation is -- a sentimentally<br>
based attachment to one's own DNA?)<br>
<p>
I'd say that none of this is beyond the realm of the near-term<br>
possible, but it is all, as I've noted, frightfully expensive. I would<br>
suggest, however, that as there are large numbers of women with<br>
similar desires, that large scale fundraising might be possible for a<br>
privately funded research and development effort on this, and that if<br>
the research properly funded and organized, solid results might be<br>
possible in only a few years.<br>
<p>
I would very seriously suggest that you might want to begin organizing<br>
in this regard before the idiots ban all research in this area --<br>
whether you have a partner in mind for this or not.<br>
<p>
