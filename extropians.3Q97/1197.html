Don't underestimate the normative weight of the "real."  Social<br>
institutions, vocabularies, scripts often best maintain themselves by<br>
relying on a fantasy of their necessity, inevitability, or self-evidence<br>
(the "given" as "taken", eh Steve?), etc.  The point is not that<br>
institutions deny the particular histories down the path of which they<br>
have been constructed, but to disavow their constructedness *as such*.  Am<br>
I the only one who remembers Adrienne Rich on "Compulsory<br>
Heterosexuality," for example?  I'm the last to deny that robust and<br>
attractive social institutions might could should and often have<br>
maintained themselves in other modes -- the openness you describe, for<br>
example -- but this simply doesn't apply to Western constructions like<br>
race, sex, gender, sexuality, beastliness, and the rest of that pesky<br>
constellation as they have come down to us here and now.  Some feminisms<br>
overestimate the strategic power of exposing the constructedness of<br>
gender, but it's surely just as wrong to underestimate the power of this<br>
exposure.  As for all the intention-speak shorthand happening in this<br>
discussion: *of course*, institutions, scripts and the like don't want to<br>
preserve and augment themselves so much as individuals do and it is by<br>
citing, performing, and otherwise making recourse to these institutions,<br>
vocabularies, scripts as they calculate and undertake actions to their<br>
best advantage, that self-interested individuals also happen to buttress<br>
and invigorate the social structures as well.  Correct?  <br>
Best, Dale<br>
