For a while, among my computer-literate friends, I've heard about this<br>
thing called the Year 2000 software crisis. Lately, it seems to be a<br>
pretty over-reported topic in not only investment and legal weeklies,<br>
but even in the mainstream media. Along with it goes, at one extreme,<br>
dramatic disasturbation, while at the same time, and on the opposite<br>
extreme, many seem complacent.<br>
<p>
The web is full of such conflicting reports. Are there any list members<br>
out there who can shed light on the problem (if it is a problem)? <br>
<p>
For those unfamiliar, dates are an important part of the software<br>
systems utilized by both government and industry. As far as I<br>
understand, the problem lies with the fact that most software developed<br>
during the past two decades for mainframes, client/server and personal<br>
computers recognizes years by only two digits ("96" for 1996) instead of<br>
four digits. When a date-senstive function requiring the year 2000<br>
("00") as operative input is performed, bad things *can* happen<br>
(crashes, silly results, inaccurate records, etc.) The problem interests<br>
me insofar as we have less than three years to solve it. Enough time? I<br>
don't know, and hence this post.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
<p>
