<i>&gt; 1)  Would an individual be uploaded to a centralized 'net' or a private</i><br>
<i>&gt; one?  Would there be a benefit in either?  If centralized how would</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'you' affect 'me'?</i><br>
<p>
I think that will depend on the available technology. At first, the <br>
computing demands of an upload would likely be rather extreme, and<br>
uploads would be run on special or general purpose supercomputers<br>
(likely blocks of massively parallel nanocomputers). These would<br>
likely be private, although I could envision an "upload hotel" where<br>
the uploads paid rent for computing resources. <br>
<p>
Running an uploaded mind over a net is trickier; as anybody trying<br>
to program distributed applications know, errors occur all the time,<br>
different parts may run att different speeds and so on. But it is<br>
also more resilent, you don't need to have a lot of resources in<br>
one place and it is probably cheaper than having a big computer<br>
somewhere. So in time uploads might be able to run on the net,<br>
like the Copies in Greg Egans seminal _Permutation City_ (IMHO<br>
the Big Uploading Novel to date). <br>
<p>
Interaction between uploads would depend on their user interfaces.<br>
My guess is that they would normally just interact by allowing some<br>
sharing between the virtual worlds they lived in, like allowing the<br>
other to visit with an avatar. Deeper contact may be possible, but<br>
would require some work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2)  Have security and backups been researched?  Could someone 'pull the</i><br>
<i>&gt; plug' and delete everyone?  Could a virus be introduced to</i><br>
<i>&gt; control/corrupt/erase an uploaded individual?</i><br>
<p>
Backups are one of the main selling points. Just make a backup (say)<br>
daily, and reboot it if you get killed. Backups may even be hidden<br>
("In the case of my untimely death, run this program").<br>
<p>
Security is essentially computer security, with some extra demands.<br>
You want to make it hard to hack the upload system (which encompasses<br>
more than the mind: the virtual environment, the body simulation,<br>
personal files, backups etc), make error recovery easy (if half of<br>
the computer memory is suddenly wiped by a disk-crash a RAID system<br>
might restore the upload without it noticing) and of course other<br>
forms of misuse (like pirate copies of people) must be prevented.<br>
Tricky, but not fundamentally different from ordinary computer<br>
security.<br>
<p>
It is likely hard to control people through a virus, since neural<br>
nets are messy and distributed; it is hard to tell where to strike<br>
to make an upload (say) vote in a certain way or sign over its<br>
money to the corrupter. Of course, if you have access to an<br>
upload, you have all the other possibilities full access to a brain<br>
could give you (shudder). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3)  Since 'thought' (as far as I can remember) is somewhat determined by</i><br>
<i>&gt; protein deposits at specific neurons (changing the course to the next</i><br>
<i>&gt; neuron I suppose) wouldn't everyone in a central 'net' then think alike?</i><br>
<p>
Not if they were different emulations. Connecting the neural nets<br>
of different uploads might be possible, but that will likely not make<br>
them identical unless they are very tightly connected (and then<br>
you will get a borganism, a collective mind, rather than a number<br>
of copies). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4)  Do emotion and the senses determine how one thinks?  I know my mood</i><br>
<i>&gt; affects my thought processes and certain smells or sounds do also.  How</i><br>
<i>&gt; will this be handled in a 'net'?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, emotions are integral to our cognitive processes (see Damasio's<br>
_Descartes' Error_), and they do affect our thinking (smells are especially<br>
powerful, they interface *directly* with our emotional systems). I<br>
don't see any reason why it would be different emulating the neural<br>
process of thinking from emotion, both are (from a computer perspective)<br>
neural interactions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 5)  If there would be no emotion I wouldn't 'care' if I were thinking or</i><br>
<i>&gt; not.  Would I cease to exist?  </i><br>
<p>
If you had no emotions, then your brain would be incomplete. Whether<br>
you would be you is a matter of definition. <br>
