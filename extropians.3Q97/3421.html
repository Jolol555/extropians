In a message dated 97-09-11 03:18:15 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; You missed my point about the farmers,<br>
 perhaps: One of the fundamental economic activities has been largely<br>
 automated (apart from luxury activites like berry-picking.)  Instread of<br>
 97% of the population it takes 3%.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
It might be appropriate to note that there were several reasons for the<br>
decrease in the number of Farmers.....not the least of which was government<br>
meddling in the labor process which increased the cost of labor...which made<br>
mechinization all the more attractive...<br>
<p>
The process is still continuing...if not accelerating..  Many small business<br>
make a concentrated effort to STAY small....  even to the point of NOT hiring<br>
any help...<br>
<p>
In my travels I constantly run across one man shows....I am one<br>
myself...wouldn't think of hiring anyone....the government hassel isn't worth<br>
it.<br>
<p>
So once again...government meddles....and increases the problem that it<br>
purported to solve...and caused numerous other problems in the process.<br>
