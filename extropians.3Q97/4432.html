So we all agree - the future is going to be weird, right?  But how weird?<br>
 Well we can't know, because it's a singularity.  Maybe the singularity is<br>
just an excuse for not making too many assumptions about our future - "it's<br>
just going to weird."  It saves us from making faulty predictions about<br>
flying cars, domed buildings and laser guns.  But is it going to be weird at<br>
all?<br>
<p>
No, it's going to be anything but weird.  Where we are today, our present<br>
state, is weird.  In the future, when we're in control, for the first time in<br>
history things will be normal.  I think people have confused the ideas of<br>
'weird' and 'different.'  The future will be different, very different, but<br>
it won't be weird.  The ability to change yourself into anything is not<br>
weird, we consider it everyday.  We look at ourselves and wish we could<br>
change things, the fact that we can is not weird, just different.  These<br>
limitations of the modern world may create boundaries on our imagination,<br>
they may stop us from exploring every possibility.  But once we destroy these<br>
boundaries, we set our imagination free.  This is not weird, we will change<br>
ourselves, and we will differentiates the boundless future from its<br>
asphyxiated past.<br>
<p>
You were born free, your imagination wondered about the infinite<br>
possibilities of the universe.  As you grew older you were crushed by a weird<br>
reality, a reality that didn't play by your rules.  Many people accepted this<br>
and gave up their childhood assumptions of immortality, boundless expansion<br>
and limitless possibilities.  But a few of us would not give in, we have<br>
taken arms against our boundaries and we ruthlessly crush them everyday.  The<br>
future will not be weird, it will be what you always assumed it to be.<br>
 Limitless.<br>
