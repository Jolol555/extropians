     What if aliens crashed in New Mexico 50 years ago and the govern=<br>

     What if in New Mexico 50 years ago there was an old lady who lived in <br>
     a shoe and she had so many children she didn't know what to do. How <br>
     would that alter your perception?<br>

     I'm not sure of the nature of your post.  It could a) be an unrealised <br>
     attempt at humor, b) a cynical yet cryptic way of making a point or c) <br>
     an evasive maneuver for the pragmatic mind gone 'tilt' &lt;G&gt;.  Perhaps <br>
     d) none of the above.  If d), please engage in the discussion for you <br>
     have had lucid posts of note in this digest in the past and I would so <br>
     welcome your opinions of merit.<br>
     <br>
     The nature of my questions is not to advocate believe in UFOs, <br>
     government conspiracy or anything else that has sensational zeal.  The <br>
     point is (I feel) these myths exist in our culture for a purpose, to <br>
     work out something that likely exists as an unrecognized undercurrent <br>
     within our culture.  Beliefs alter our perception.  The truth used to <br>
     be that the world was flat, the earth was the center of the universe, <br>
     epileptics were demon-posessed, that women who did not marry and lived <br>
     independently of men were dangerous witches, that homosexuals were <br>
     mentally ill.  I shall not presume to think that just because we've <br>
     presumably aced the laws of physics and come up with hundreds of other <br>
     technological marvels that we've got the schematic of the universe <br>
     down pat.  The next frontiers are much more vast than an ocean or a <br>
     continent.  They are the far reaches of space and the inner workings <br>
     of the mind. (cue music...)<br>
     <br>
     Incidentally, the nursery rhyme you dug up for reasons a or b (c <br>
     doesn't seem to apply) is in itself pertinent, albeit not to this <br>
     discussion.  However, I'm sure someone in the know will pipe up with <br>
     the likely political allegory tied to the woman in the shoe story, <br>
     although I don't think it's a cold war connection &lt;G&gt;.<br>
     <br>
