The biggest problem I can think of with Home tuition, is not the lack of<br>
association with other children, but the lack of freedom a child has in his<br>
or her own home.  When would the child unleash his or her anger?  When will<br>
they have the chance to learn the importance of rebellion?  And how can we<br>
stop a child's parents from imprinting dogmatic views?  Children are an<br>
important part of progress, and some of the thing's parents find wrong are<br>
the very things that aid that progress.<br>
<p>
Also, couldn't constant contact with adult's lead to an inferiority complex?<br>
 Isn't there something to be said for sharing discovery with others, rather<br>
than the "yes, yes I know" attitude of adults?<br>
