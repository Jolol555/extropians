<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Earlier you asserted that knowledge of the white dwarf Sirius B</i><br>
<i>&gt; went back thousands of years among the Dogon.  This is the part</i><br>
<i>&gt; of your claim that I take issue with.  When was it discovered</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the Dogon had this knowledge?  Who was the first non-Dogon</i><br>
<i>&gt; to publish about this knowledge, and when?  Were the Dogons a</i><br>
<i>&gt; literate people or was knowledge of Sirius's pup transmitted in</i><br>
<i>&gt; an oral tradition?  If it was transmitted in an oral tradition,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then what is the evidence that the knowledge is as old among</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Dogon as claimed?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; These questions matter because Europeans discovered Sirius's</i><br>
<i>&gt; pup late in the 19th century, and at the time of discovery,</i><br>
<i>&gt; this would have been widely discussed by scientifically-curious</i><br>
<i>&gt; literate people worldwide, not just astronomers.  Knowledge of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the white dwarf companion might have come to the Dogon at this</i><br>
<i>&gt; time, shortly after the discovery by the Europeans, and been</i><br>
<i>&gt; "rediscovered" among the Dogon by some cultural anthropologist</i><br>
<i>&gt; at few decades later.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know whether the claim about the Dogon is true, but I</i><br>
<i>&gt; do know what sort of information I'd need to see a lot more of</i><br>
<i>&gt; before I'd take this claim at face value.  Where do these</i><br>
<i>&gt; claims originate in the literature? is always a good start.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I've seen the claims. The "datedness" of the oral tradition has<br>
supposedly been verified by dating rock carvings depicting the minor<br>
stellar companion beside Sirius A in the proper orientation with respect<br>
to other stars. I forget the individuals involved in the "discovery", so<br>
I can't lend any support to it or against, but considering the Dogon<br>
proximity to arabic trading routes, would it be possible that early<br>
arabic spotting scopes may have found their way into the star<br>
worshipping Dogon Preisthood?<br>
<p>
It's one of those oddities of history that is difficult to reconcile<br>
with the historical "record". However, how much of real human history is<br>
either undiscovered or known but kept off the record for political<br>
reasons? This is not to say that it should be beleived, but possibly<br>
that it is odd enough to warrant more study than maybe it has received<br>
to date?<br>
