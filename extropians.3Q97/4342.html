In the book Heinlein is quite specific that the actual qualification<br>
is the willingness to risk your life to defend your civilization,<br>
not just to serve in any capacity.<br>
<p>
The quote from the book that sums this up comes in the letter<br>
to Juan gets at boot camp from his H&amp;MP teacher:<br>
   The Noblest fate that a man can endure is to place his own<br>
   mortal body between his loved home and the war's desolation.<br>
<p>
The teacher explains that these are not his own words, (That<br>
makes this a fourth-level of quoting) but that Juan would<br>
of course recognize them. I don't. Do you?<br>
<p>
A friend told me years ago that Heinlein was inspired about this<br>
form of government by an essay by Rudyard Kipling called<br>
(as I recall) "The Army of a Dream." I just attempted to<br>
validate this on alta vista and didn't get a hit, but the<br>
friend is a usually reliable source. There are Kipling<br>
quotes in "Starship Troopers."<br>
