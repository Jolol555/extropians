There is so much to learn to understand politics, that little room is left<br>
for understanding people (I'm sure even AMG would agree.)<br>
<p>
Besides, I have nothing against politics - in the words of Sun Tzu Wu, "know<br>
your enemy."<br>
<p>
    "The supreme excellence is not to win a hundred victories in a <br>
    hundred battles.  The supreme excellence is to subdue the <br>
    armies of your enemies without even having to fight them"<br>
<p>
But if you treat your enemy with divinity, you will find it hard to fight<br>
them.  Government's are the competition (the enemy) of all free market<br>
business, if you want to survive in the free market you must treat them as<br>
such.<br>
<p>
    "Amid the turmoil and turmult of battle, there may be seeming <br>
    disorder and yet no disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, <br>
    your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against <br>
    defeat."<br>
<p>
This is after all, an anarchy with a few gun-toating monoplies who suceed<br>
because of consumer ignorance.  And while you made some very good comments<br>
concerning the need for government intervention in other countries, I think<br>
there is a solution to be found amid the chaos.<br>
<p>
    "When in difficult country, do not encamp.  In country where high <br>
    roads intersect, join hands with your allies.  Do not linger in <br>
    dangerously isolated positions."<br>
<p>
There are billions of potential customers in China.  If getting to this<br>
lucrative market means crushing the competition (the government) then how<br>
many companies wouldn't take that chance?<br>
<p>
    "It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure <br>
    secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order... He must be <br>
    able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and <br>
    appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance."<br>
<p>
Authority requires disinformation, stay informed.<br>
