Rick Knight &lt;rknight@platinum.com&gt; responded:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I suppose it has a parallel to the modern Christian Scientists who</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been known, in certain devout situations, to withhold</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves (and their CHILDREN!) from practical and available</i><br>
<i>&gt; medical attention and instead chose prayer, laying on of hands etc..</i><br>
<p>
	Precisely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But I also chose to believe that if a divine influence was working</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the world, it didn't work exclusively in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; supernatural/miraculous way.</i><br>
<p>
	All of nature is divine and miraculous to me.  The fact that<br>
Force = Mass * Acceleration is a glorious miracle to me.  It's just<br>
that if there is some sentient and powerful being, unnaturally<br>
meddling in this glorious and divine system of ours, then this being<br>
is either necessarily not very powerful, not benevolent, or evil as we<br>
know it is necessary or else this being would remove it.  No matter<br>
how much evidence there is for such (and there is no rational evidence<br>
I can see), I'd still hope such hideousness might not be true.  I<br>
believe in miracles, I just don't believe in unnatural miracles.  I'm<br>
diabetic and the miracle of insulin has truly saved my life.  Back<br>
when they only had "laying on of hands" and didn't know about insulin,<br>
diabetics just died.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My stop gap is still not that I don't *care* whether I die, I just</i><br>
<i>&gt; have this very deep conviction, intuitively, that I am more than a</i><br>
<i>&gt; biological computer.</i><br>
<p>
	In my opinion your intuitions are right on!  To me the truth<br>
of such is obvious.  There is a phenomenally, feeling, spiritual us<br>
inside a glorious world made of qualia constructed by our brain that<br>
models what our senses sense.  The phenomenal nature of all this<br>
emotional stuff is much more than any old: "biological computer".  If<br>
abstract computers ever did become (or more likely when they become)<br>
smart enough to be somewhat intelligent and creative they will realize<br>
that their knowledge is mere abstract representations.  Like commander<br>
Data in Star Trek, they, too will seek the ability to really feel and<br>
experience joy and other spiritual things.<br>
<p>
	I certainly hope we can eventually discover and understand all<br>
this kind of stuff and what it is we are.  It would be so depressing<br>
if we couldn't understand ourselves enough to be able to take<br>
ourselves apart and put us back together again in a much improved<br>
state wouldn't it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This seems to be the "given" in embracing cryonics and I'm just not</i><br>
<i>&gt; there.</i><br>
<p>
	It's not a given for me!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Though that may defy logic in the eyes of some, I use more than one</i><br>
<i>&gt; internal organ to determine my actions (note to the left-brained:</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm being metaphorical).</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, a current, non biological computer's representations are<br>
not phenomenal in any way.  It doesn't matter what a computer uses to<br>
represent 700nm light.  But to me, it most definitely must be the<br>
glorious sensation which is red.  No mere abstract representation is<br>
anything like red.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At this point, cryonics is about as viable as Mormonism &lt;G&gt;.  </i><br>
<p>
	For me, Mormonism has lots of good ideas (or at least some<br>
good dreams or hopes of some 14 year old boy).  Like man may become<br>
God, Salvation and miracles are dependent on works, God is natural and<br>
part of the universe, the earth will be converted into heaven (rather<br>
than everyone going to some unnatural neither world heaven)...  "men<br>
are that they might have joy"...  If all the liberals didn't give up<br>
and leave, leaving all the fundamentalists in charge, I think it could<br>
eventually become not to different than extropianism and cryonics.<br>
(or at least tolerantly include members with extropian tendencies) My<br>
favorite Mormon article of faith says: "We believe all things, we hope<br>
all things..."  As the extropians believes, if it isn't yet the way<br>
everyone likes it there is simply (eternally?) more work to do right?<br>
And so on and so forth without bounds.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The logic of "even if it's not very likely (reanimation), it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; better than rotting in a grave" sounds suspiciously like "if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't accept Jesus, you'll burn in hell."</i><br>
<p>
	For me, it's infinitely more than this.  It may not be an<br>
absolute guarantee that cryonics will work for all this time around,<br>
but it seems to me that it is very likely a good chance that<br>
immortality is possible.  And if immortality is possible, some day,<br>
then can't we hope that some day we may discover or achieve the<br>
ability to do all things?  Ultimately faith is required and, until<br>
things are the way we like them (i.e. all are resurrected), we should<br>
never give up trying right?<br>
<p>
	If there is anyone in hell, sheo, the grave or whatever, and I<br>
am alive and able to do work in any way, I will forever be trying to<br>
figure out how to rescue them, since I hope to have perfect empathy,<br>
and thereby will suffer equally with them as long as they are in hell.<br>
We simply must never give up right?<br>
