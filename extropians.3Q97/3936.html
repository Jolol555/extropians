Er, no.  The tobacco companies aren't doing so well, for one.  No one<br>
owns the system; it's a mess of conflicting interests.  Old liberalism<br>
trusted no one with power, but recognized that power could not be<br>
abolished, so sought to multiply the sources of it and set them in<br>
opposition to each other.  The US Constitution may owe more to Newton<br>
than to Locke.  Set them all at loggerheads and let power cancel itself<br>
out.  Voters have power, and sitting politicians have power, and<br>
corporations have power, and celebrities have power, and judges have<br>
power... the balance shifts back and forth, but rarely is dominated by<br>
any one faction (and of course, none of the groups I just listed are<br>
monolithic entities.)<br>

<p>
Oy veh!  You expect us to write an introductory economics textbook for<br>
you?  Perhaps we should teach you what the periodic table is as well?<br>
Negative feedback is when a process generates other processes which act<br>
against it.  If the temperature in my house goes down the thermostat<br>
turns on the heater, raising the temperature back to the desired level.<br>
If a star collapsed a bit more, it would raise the core temperature,<br>
raising the rate of fusion, and thus raising the pressure keeping the<br>
star from collapsing any further.<br>
<p>
Positive feedback is when a process stimulates itself -- a clump of mass<br>
attracts more matter, and thus has more gravity with which to attract<br>
more matter, which brings more gravity...<br>

<p>
Hardly necessarily.  Alongside economies of scale are prices of scale.<br>
An insect can get its oxygen through simple diffusion.  Big things like<br>
us need hearts and blood vessels to move oxygen and food around.  A<br>
large corporation needs be more complex, and thus has slower response<br>
times, and administrative costs, etc.  It works well for mass producing<br>
standard products, poorly for high quality specialty goods.  Thus the<br>
failure of supermarkets to drive out all the small bread and cheese<br>
stores in a well-off city.<br>
<p>
"united we fall, when we make one dumb mistake which effects us all [see<br>
China]; divided we grow, as diversity explores many different ways of<br>
doing something, and keeps the effects of mistakes localized, and<br>
preserves healthy areas which can regenerate the loss."<br>

<p>
Well, that explains why the Western world rose up and banned CFCs.  Must<br>
have been those nasty Freon producing corporations who told their<br>
owned governments to...<br>
<p>
} EvMick says that free-market works, my question is for whom, for the<br>

<p>
The free market of cities has done more, over time, to turn poor people<br>
into well-off middle class citizen than anything else.  The Church did<br>
not raise the poor.  Welfare has not raised the poor.  Communism -- many<br>
attempts -- did not raise the poor.  It was the burgs which created the<br>
bourgeois, who'd once been poor.  All, of course, have had some sort of<br>
law-and-order government.<br>
<p>
Jane Jacobs argues that the most productive arrangement of humanity is<br>
in city-states with free trade.  The most military arrangement of<br>
humanity is, alas, in nation-states, and thus the current world.<br>
<p>
} ask you something, do you think that the poorer classes generated by<br>
} free-markets will stand still? My bet is that they'll riot and that is<br>
<p>
Poverty has no causes!  Only prosperity has causes.  Poverty and<br>
ignorance are the natural state of humanity, which we work to rise<br>
above.  The market does not generate poor people; it generates poor<br>
classes only insofar as it generates rich classes, creating a contrast<br>
with those who have not risen as far.<br>

On TWA 800<br>
"Also, if judged by past behavior, the US Navy does not lie about shooting<br>
down airliners. When the Vincennes downed the Airbus, the Navy admitted they<br>
did it, held an investigation, axed the skipper, and the US government<br>
ultimately made reparations to the families. I think we should give the navy<br>
the benefit of the doubt if they say they didn't do it."<br>
