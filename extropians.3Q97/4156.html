Dear Associates on list extropians,<br>
<p>
My first post to the list was a month old.  Today's post is only three days<br>
old.  In between, there were four other posts, as tabulated below, which<br>
approached the TEFLON TOPIC from several points of view.  This is one topic<br>
in which each of us has an interest.<br>
<p>
97-08-20, A Conceptual Framework For The TEFLON Topic (to list extropians<br>

97-08-27, "Our Global Neighborhood"<br>
97-08-29, A Flow Diagram to define THE TEFLON TOPIC<br>

Dear Proponents of Opposing Ideologies: Anarchy or World Government<br>
<p>
Neither faction had anything to say about the "present condition" of the<br>
United States regarding the six questions I asked in two previous posts.<br>
<p>
1,  Why does the U.S. economy use only $1,020 billion of M1, if the banking<br>
system controls the money supply?  Why not $2,040 billion with twice the<br>
interest?  <br>
<p>
2, Why are the U.K. and the U.S. withholding their capital investments?<br>
<p>
3, Why is this Nobel Prize winning work (INPUT/OUTPUT ECONOMICS, 1966 by<br>
Wassily Leontief) as seldom mentioned in the public dialogue as Thomas<br>
Paine's 1797 work, AGRARIAN JUSTICE?<br>
<p>
4, Who benefits from this mass of transactions in, this churning of, this<br>
buying and selling of our existing wealth?  A vital economic function?  Or, a<br>
wealthy person's sport?<br>
<p>
5, We can get serious about this TEFLON TOPIC by asking the members of the<br>
President's 1983 Commission on Entitlements what they intended to accomplish<br>
when they established the present Social Security Payroll Tax of 15% on<br>
earned income below $63,000/year, without any exemptions for dependents, and<br>
a zero% tax rate on all income above $63,000/year?<br>
<p>
6, I wonder who will be the first prominent American to address the topic<br>
since Henry Carter Adams last addressed it in his 1887 essay, RELATION OF THE<br>
STATE TO INDUSTRIAL ACTION?<br>
<p>
Here is a way of looking at the "present condition" of the United States in<br>
relation to the most important eleven other industrial nations in the world<br>
economy.  <br>

TOTAL GNP of Twelve Nations ----  $17,645 billion /year  -----------------<br>
<p>
Notice that the U.K and the U.S. are the engines of inflation in this<br>
laboratory of nations.<br>
<p>
If the U.K. and the U.S. reduced their inflation rate to the 0.6%/year rate<br>
that the Swiss have achieved, would that new condition reduce the Liberal<br>
establishment's drive toward world government?  I believe that such a new<br>
condition would enable the nations to find valid alternatives to world<br>
government, that is, nations could enjoy the benefits of a world economy<br>
without world government.  <br>
<p>
It seems that seven of the nine western nations have formulated and reduced<br>
to practice a "General Theory of Reproducible Productive Assets" that works<br>
for them and allows them to stabilize their money systems.  Remember, in 1949<br>
the U.S. GNP/capita was 171% of the Swiss GNP/capita.  Today, it is only 70%<br>
of the Swiss GNP/capita.<br>
<p>
As James Madison once said: "We have staked the whole future of American<br>
civilization, not upon the power of government, far from it. We have staked<br>
the future...upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to<br>
sustain ourselves, according to the Ten Commandments of God."  Ten<br>
commandments were adequate for the agrarian society that Madison lived in.<br>
 Today he would have to say "the Twelve Commandments of God" to keep the<br>
United States in step with the other seven industrial nations.<br>
<p>
We should think about it, or try to keep Russia, China, and India from<br>
thinking about it, or both.<br>
