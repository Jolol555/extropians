Sometimes I have to drive far into the night....if not all night.  When I do<br>
I listen to the Radio...notably Art Bell.  Many of his shows have a very high<br>
"giggle factor"...but some are thought provoking.  For example one night he<br>
interviewed the dude from "Nanothinc" I forget his name... concerning<br>
nanotechnology.(that interview was still available via archived "real audio"<br>
last I looked.)<br>
<p>
The other night I heard an extended interview with (Thread One:Roswell)<br>
retired Colonel Carauso.  The interview was conducted with great care.  The<br>
Colonel's credentials were presented and corrorborated by multiple<br>
sources...every contension was supported in great detail. The upshot of it<br>
was that since the 50's alien technology has been infused into our<br>
industry...hence Lasers, Night Vision, MicroChips, fiber optics, etc. etc.<br>
were derived.  The funny little aliens are actually "biots" (Arthur C. Clarke<br>
term..RAMA series...Caruso didn't use it but I felt it appropriate) and the<br>
US military has been at "war" with them for decades.<br>
<p>
Later I heard an interview with (Thread Two: Mars) Richard Hoagland.  It too<br>
was carefully presented.  There were multiple supporters to validate the<br>
concepts as they were presented...all had impressive<br>
credentials...exNASA.....a geologist...an electronics/acoustics expert... a<br>
telemetry expert...I think about 4 or 5 in all. Once again everything was<br>
nailed down tight...repeatedly. (The upshot being that somehow the Egyptian<br>
Pyramids, all other ancient earthly pyramids and the Martian "Ruins" were all<br>
connected...that Sojurner is investigating Martian ruins right now...that is<br>
the "Twin Peaks" mentioned in a NASA breifing...which are actually Martian<br>
Arcologies..one of which was badly damaged ,..both of which were mostly<br>
buried by sediments from  the flood which caused the floodplain where the<br>
rover landed.<br>

<p>
So where would these two (actually three or four...pyramids..two different<br>
flavors of aliens..UFO's..) ideas and the people who present them...fit on<br>
this chart? And why?<br>
<p>
Keeping in mind that :<br>
       all the participants are "experts" in their respective fields...that<br>
is they have        oodles of credentials, awards, and experience.  How is<br>
one expert to beleived and another one not?  Why or why not is one Ph.d more<br>
credible than another. <br>
<p>
        anything the government says is not to be trusted...the government<br>
being a pathological liar...( examples being:the challenger disaster, flight<br>
800, Ruby Ridge, Waco, Campaign Finance, The Kennedy Assasination...Plutonium<br>
injections...Syphiliss Experiments....the extent and danger of fallout from<br>
above ground nuclear testing in the 60s....."non existent "troops in<br>
Laos..the betrayal of Geronimo....ad nauseum...the list is probably infinite.<br>

the National Media tell it)Truck Driver Wants to Know.<br>
