<i>&gt; Dr Stephen Thaler's approach is a milestone in achieving strides in AI,</i><br>

<i>&gt; It is my view that in the future, near and far, that "creativity" will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; understood and appreciated more than ever.   This includes not only the</i><br>
<i>&gt; psychological ramifications of creativity, but also the practical</i><br>
<i>&gt; applications of creativity as being as vital in our thinking as intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt; is.  The "Creativity Augmentum" in the 21st Century, as I see it, will</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainly be worth investing in.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I don't think that technical creativity is a separate<br>
quality from artistic creativity or any other kind of<br>
creativity. I focus on technical creativity only because<br>
I'm interested in its effects on technically-augmented<br>
enhancement of intelligence.<br>
<p>
My 14-year-old is just starting high school at Thomas<br>
Jefferson High School of Science and Technology.<br>
TJHSST is arguably the best high school in the country.<br>
Interstingly, one of the major concerns that many students<br>
have before deciding to go there is that they will be<br>
required to be science nerds. A few of the students are<br>
in fact science nerds, but the percentage of students<br>
with strong interests and abilities in the arts appears<br>
to be much higher than in other high schools, and the<br>
students are encouraged to take courses and to participate.<br>
<p>
Interestingly, if in fact a post-human SI evolves to the<br>
point of being limited only by the laws of physics, then<br>
esthetics and creativity will be the only remaining<br>
determinates of the SI's actions. In effect, everything the<br>
SI does will be art.<br>
