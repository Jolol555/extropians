Hi!<br>

<i>&gt; Let us examine a specific case of genetic error, cancer:</i><br>

<i>&gt; Would you say that the reason sharks don't get cancer is because they</i><br>

<i>&gt; primitive.  I would, however, call a number of plants primitive, all of</i><br>
<i>&gt; which have been known to develop tumors.  As human beings, we have a more</i><br>
<i>&gt; complicated and prone-to-error genome, but we also have more</i><br>
<i>&gt; sophisticated ways of dealing with these errors-- apparently, so do</i><br>
<i>&gt; sharks. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have another quibble in the form of a question:  can you think of an</i><br>
<i>&gt; organism more primitive than a shark that DOES age?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; All this said, in principle, I agree with what you're trying to say.</i><br>
<p>
Thanks, obviously I was generalizing and there are many exceptions.<br>
IMHO, what happened was that some species evolved to correct their<br>
genetic errors while others evolved to become more complex and therefore<br>
having more errors (and, of course, some species evolved to become more<br>
complex and more perfect, others hardly evolved, etc). It can be argued<br>
that we correct more errors than sharks but since we are more complex,<br>
we have more errors and we will age while sharks don't.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;  IMHO,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; their evolution lead them to correct the errors in their genome while</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; our evolution made us consecutively more complex</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you saying their evolution *did not* make them consecutively more</i><br>
<i>&gt; complex?</i><br>
<p>
Not in the same way as us. Our species appeared about 100 000 years ago<br>
while other species (such as alligators, etc) appeared much before. Of<br>
course that evolution made them more complex but at a lower rate than us<br>
and made them more 'perfect'. BTW, sharks do get cancer, they get it a<br>
much lower rate than us but they naturally get it.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Transferring? Transferring what? Your brain? Your 'soul'?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The functioning and abilities of my brain.  I would call this</i><br>
<i>&gt; "consciousness"  Some might argue with my use of this word.</i><br>
<p>
I continue not understanding what are you trying to say.<br>
"consciousness", what is that? Is it something physical such as all your<br>
memory proteins (I remember reading somewhere about the existence of<br>
memory proteins but I'm not sure), the positions and connections between<br>
your neurons?<br>
Is it something spiritual?<br>
Is it something like, the design and constitution of your networks of<br>
neurons that can (or will) be duplicated on a computer to make it think<br>
like you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; One idea (that I already though about years ago) is to increase the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; viability of our neurons with metal or whatever but this is a continuos</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; process. Just like now, the atoms that compose my neurons are not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; same that were a few hours ago, exception made to some molecules such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; DNA, our neuron's atoms change continually and I don't complain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Connecting memory chips to our brain might not be a bad idea but that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a change and not a transfer. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If your brain ends up in the same state after a series of "changes" or one</i><br>
<i>&gt; single transfer, what, exactly, is the difference?</i><br>
<p>
It has to do with identity, singularity or individuality. I already<br>
discussed that a couple of messages ago.<br>
Say, let's suppose you suffer a terrible accident and lose a part of<br>
brain changing your personality. Are you the same person you were?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; This idea you "thought about years ago"</i><br>
<i>&gt; is called "nano-replacement"  Look it up.</i><br>
<p>
Really, I didn't knew that. For much you come up with weird ideas, there<br>
will always be someone out there thinking the same thing. I used to<br>
think I was the only crazy lunatic trying to fight aging! Well, I'm the<br>
only guy I know in Portugal who does.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Obviously, before uploading can be achieved, we have to understand all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; functioning of neurons that contribute to consciousness and then be able</i><br>
<i>&gt; ot duplicate those functions on another platform.</i><br>
<p>
Let's suppose that someone builds another platform thinking exactly like<br>
you. Say, a computer. Note that you are not dead, you are looking at a<br>
computer who thinks just like you, is this computer you? What if you're<br>
dead? What if your brain is destroyed while the computer is built?<br>
Let's suppose you build another platform, how do you transfer your<br>
"consciousness" to that platform? How would you know the platform would<br>
be you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What about when I bang my head on the door, is that aging?  I would say </i><br>
<i>&gt; no, yet my neurons die, never to grow back.</i><br>
<p>
Don't be provocative, you know what I mean. The great majority of<br>
neuronal loss, in normal persons, is aging.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Hey, if you have "good ideas" to stop aging, I'll be very receptive to</i><br>
<i>&gt; them.</i><br>
<p>
Give a laboratory so that I can try them out.<br>
As for the ideas, unfortunately my site is not working but there is a<br>
section called "Solutions and Problems" where I place "good ideas" to<br>
stop aging as well as several problems attached to them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even in birds, where the neurons do grow back, the information contained</i><br>
<i>&gt; within those neurons is lost forever. </i><br>
<p>
What a flaw in my culture, I didn't know neurons in birds grew back. I<br>
read that the axon of the neuron in some reptilians does grow back but<br>
not the neuron itself.<br>
Tell me more about this birds capacity, for example, what happens, does<br>
the neuron itself grow back or is it just the axon? If it is the neuron,<br>
how does it happen, are there any replicating neurological cells, I've<br>
never heard of any but who knows? What about regeneration of whole<br>
members such as a leg, it happens in reptilians, I don't remember<br>
happening in birds, is this true? How do you explain it? Do you have<br>
links for more information?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; If you have no evidence or proofs, what is the source of this "belief" of</i><br>
<i>&gt; yours.  Also, what purpose does this belief serve?  Are you afraid of</i><br>
<i>&gt; being "undecided"?</i><br>
<p>
I guess it's a bit irrational (when you don't have any evidences and<br>
need to draw conclusions, you use your balls right?), I lived with my<br>
brain all my life and so far I had no problems. That's probably why I<br>
feel so reluctant in changing my brain.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; What makes you think the brain is the only platform for consciouness?  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; sounds like a very religious and anthropocentric assumption.</i><br>
<p>
It's my only platform for intelligent (I don't like much the word<br>
"consciousness"), I think there is intelligent life in the universe<br>
besides ours, I think in the future we will built computers much more<br>
intelligent than us. For me, as an individual, my only platform is my<br>
brain.<br>
 <br>
See ya,<br>
