   At 11:58 24-08-97 -0400, I wrote<br>

And you wrote<br>
 <br>
 I'll just give you the left-wing, Dutch pinko view on this stuff and if you<br>
 want to flame me to crisp ... that is your right as a free entity.<br>
<p>
(Never...disagree &lt;violently...semantically speaking...perhaps&gt;)<br>
<p>
 Maybe it would be worthwhile to try to break the armrace between a number<br>
 of citizens and American law-enforcement agencies.<br>
 If everybody can (and does) own guns, policing becomes dangerous as hell,<br>
 cops want bigger guns and more of them, and they will use them more often.<br>
<p>
(Our second amendment to our constitution was intended as a last ditch<br>
defense against tyranny...if everyone owns guns...the government is a bit<br>
reluctant to get too uppity)<br>
<p>
 In Holland NOBODY get's to own a gun unless there are special circumstances.<br>
 our murder-rate is about 15 (fifteen!!) times as low as the US (per capita).<br>
 Now, there could also be other reasons for this but IM(very)HO the private<br>
 ownership of (hundreds?)of millions of handguns, shotguns and such has<br>
 something to do with it. I onze read somewhere that between 1965 and 1975<br>
 more than 500.000 US citizens where shot in the US (10 for every American<br>
 killed in 'nam).<br>
<p>
(Interesting fact...in the US...violence tends to vary by locale...more in<br>
inner cities than Rural and interestingly enough...less the closer to Canada<br>
and more the closer to Mexico...I dunno why...but I can guess...be<br>
politically incorrect and be "flamed to a crisp")  (And Mexico bans guns<br>
totally too...and has a VERY high rate of violence..higher than the US...but<br>
we'll blame that on "Poverty")<br>
<p>
 For their sake, please consider a society without (to much) guns and a<br>
 governement that you at least trust a little bit.<br>
<p>
(trust must be earned...in my lifetime it's been betrayed)<br>
<p>
 Seems to work out more or less here ...<br>
 <br>
 If the US governement is as F*%$#-up as you seem to believe (I woulnd't<br>
 know, being on this side of the atlantic), why not get a new one? Last time<br>
 I heard the US was a democracy.<br>
<p>
(I heard it was a democracy too...I'm beginning to doubt it...less than 15%<br>
of the populance voted for our current president...but there he is...some<br>
democracy...&lt;yeah...I know...voter apathy...more like voter disgust...&gt;)<br>
 <br>
 Mick, in spite of the fact that I don't always agree with you, I find you<br>
 down-to-earth remarks very refreshing (and fun!)....<br>
<p>
(Thank you...very flattering...and I DO many times agree with you....and<br>
didn't until this minute know you were in  (from) Holland....such a deal!!!)<br>
