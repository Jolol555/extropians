Please forgive me my english-grammar,<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
IMHO this is Not the issue:<br>
<p>
ME/YOU =  the "structure" ( atoms/quarks/light/energy....whatever !!)<br>
                  that holds my information, wich I consider as ME<br>
<p>
At the moment I don't care what it really is: just 2 things for the thought<br>
<p>
experiment:<br>
<p>
 1. you can freeze it TOTALY ,as in, no change what so ever<br>
     for a period of time.     <br>
<p>
 2. you can record it in a database PERFECT<br>
<p>
Then: you destroy the original ( in the same place )<br>
and you build it again perfect , according to the data base.<br>
Will it be the same !<br>
if Yes ?<br>
What is different when you copy the structure<br>
<p>
I could be wrong in saying that the matter wich holds my information,<br>
is not of any importance ! I'll accept it as a limit of the discussion.<br>
IMHO: atoms moving in a "reasonable" margin, who togheter form<br>
my brain, are togheter so complex, that it can hold ME, and I know it holds<br>
ME, but I can not really understand it, because my thoughts about<br>
this can't go beyond this structure. All the loose particels togheter<br>
form something so complex that they form randomly ME. But<br>
the particals self are very simple. Therefor you can copy/record<br>
them "exactly" enhough to copy/restore them as ME.<br>
This give's me the problem, that I could be ME twice !<br>
<p>
I hope this is of any use,<br>
else I will first read all the suggestions, and shut up for a while :-)<br>
<p>
Greetings,<br>
<p>
Berrie<br>
<p>
PS: IMHO if you reply with "read this first", how are you going to keep<br>
up with something. When I've read it, the discussion is gone......<br>
When do you have read enhough, to have a conversation ?<br>
