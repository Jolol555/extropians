No, as I said it can raise hackles.  I am an atheist. I consider all this<br>

leaves people more open to folly, but also to bizarre ideas... so sometimes I<br>
do not (most here may disagree with me) wish to devalue "spirituality's"<br>
function in cultures, but rather seek to find out about it, explore it, to<br>
find it's function and how we can find a rational alternative - a creative<br>
reformation.<br>
This way of viewing things is useful to me own imaginative/creative process. <br>

Humiliating people, so far,  is not.  If it becomes so, i will let you know ;<br>
