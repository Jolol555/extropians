In a message dated 97-09-21 14:46:40 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; But to show I can, I shall now prove four related propositions:<br>
  1)  The sky is green.<br>
  2)  The sky is purple.<br>
  3)  The sky has red polka-dots.<br>
  4)  (Generalized:)  The sky is any color.<br>
  <br>
  1)  Sun is yellow.  Sky is blue.  Yellow + blue = green.<br>
  2)  The sky is purple, at night.<br>
  3)  The stars are polka-dots.  Some of them are red giants.<br>
  4)  There are many planets in the Universe.  Some of them will have skies<br>
of<br>
  any given color.<br>
  <br>
  I did not make up the explanations first.  First I made up the<br>
propositions,<br>
  then I proved them.  Note that every explanation is *true*.  No matter how<br>
  ridiculous the propositions may seem, they are quite correct.  If I'd shown<br>
  you those propositions and told you I was going to prove them, you would<br>
 have<br>
  laughed.  Instead you are now placed in the position of asserting that they<br>
  are sober fact.<br>
  <br>
  Which they aren't.  Three are flawed.  You see, given my enormous talent in<br>
  the area of rationalization, I have become *very* good at detecting<br>
 incorrect<br>
  ones.  But can you find the flaws?<br>
<i>   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
 Hi,<br>
  they're all flaws,<br>
 <br>
 because <br>
 1) the sky is only blue and yellow, not green, but then again there are<br>
 sometimes tints of greens in storms and at sunsets<br>
 2)if the sky is purple it isnt fully night, but then again in cities that<br>
 have pollution the sky may look purple<br>
 3)stars are not polkadots, they're stars, but then again stars are just<br>
words<br>
 to define those bright round things in the sky, and they llok like points<br>
 rather than dots, or maybe just very small dots<br>
 4)you dont know for a fact about those planets, they could or couldnt, but<br>
 there's a high probability they could<br>
 <br>
 so they all can be explained either way, as a lot of things are that way, so<br>
 there's a mystery to it.<br>
 <br>
 The proof about astrology is that is that many if not all the predictions<br>
are<br>
 correct in some way.  Astrology is very old.  there's a tribe in africa (the<br>
 dogon tribe) who have known about the star sirius b (sirius a's companion,<br>
 the sirius constellation is what the pyramids of giza are aligned to)<br>
 thousands of years before we had the technology to discover it. It proves<br>
 theres a mysterious force, and the thing is there's SO many things like<br>
that.<br>

<p>
I forgot to ask, what were your explanations for how they were wrong?<br>
