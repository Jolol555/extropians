I've been following this Cassini debate very closely *. <br>
<p>
My personal opinion is that the antagonists are using this as a banner for<br>
their personal causes.  I honestly don't know why it has carried so far.<br>
My scientist friends are perplexed also. You may be interested<br>
in a "back-of-the-envelope" calculation that Jeff Cuzzi performed<br>
to demonstrate that the Plutonium risk is pretty small. <br>
I attach that below.<br>

Dust Detector instrument on Cassini, the Cassini Project at MPE-Garching <br>
is funding my PhD project, and I have many friends and colleagues <br>

Cassini Plutonium for the technically minded<br>
by Jeff Cuzzi<br>
<p>
I'm sure we will all have friends and relatives asking us what's up<br>
with the Cassini Plutonium issue as launch approaches in early<br>
October. Allegations of risk have arisen due to Cassini's onboard<br>
RTG's (Radioisotope Thermal Generators) which derive electricity from<br>
decay of 72 lb (33kg) of Plutonium dioxide fuel.<br>
<p>
In anticipation, I wanted to provide some "derived from basic<br>
principles" satisfaction that the Cassini health threat is negligibly<br>
small even in the extremely small chance that anything does go wrong<br>
with the mission (either at launch or at flyby). The Cassini project<br>
has devoted more than a million dollars to a thorough analysis of the<br>
problem, but the back-of-an-envelope analysis below is a little easier<br>
to grasp and serves as a calibration and sanity check.<br>
<p>
I am a Cassini scientist, and neither a health expert, nor a nuclear<br>
physicist.  I do care about the health of the people of the world.  I<br>
had several discussions with a physicist at the Nuclear Regulatory<br>
Commission (NRC) concerning decay rates and comparative relationships<br>
to health effects. I also had this reviewed by the President of the<br>
Health Physics Society, a 6500 member national organization (who has<br>
publicly stated that NASA has done a very good job and has, if<br>
anything, OVERestimated the health risks).<br>
<p>
For my initial health effect data I relied on Web sites maintained by<br>
the EPA and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry<br>
(ATSDR; part of the Center for Disease Control - see references<br>
below); my NRC and Davis contacts confirmed these values and<br>
identified their primary source (FGR-11, 1988).  I suspect anyone can<br>
reproduce the calculations below who can read a simple physics<br>
textbook and the World Wide Web.<br>
<p>
238-Pu decays by alpha-particle emission (like the longer-lived<br>
weapons grade isotope 239-Pu, but 250x faster).  The decay rate can be<br>
calculated from the half life (88 yrs) and the number of nuclei per<br>
gram, and is about 6E11 decays/sec/gm, defined as 17 Curie/gm. A Curie<br>
(Ci) of 238-Pu and a Ci of 239-Pu have the same radiation damage<br>
potential (they emit the same alpha particles).  Because 238 decays<br>
faster, it has a higher Ci/g rating by the ratio of half lives (about<br>
250). The convenient unit is pico-Curies (10^-12 Ci = pCi).<br>
<p>
Health standards are set by the International Commission on<br>
Radiological Protection (ICRP), and found in FGR-11 and the ATSDR web<br>
page.  The conversion factors between radioactivity (Ci) and potential<br>
tissue damage in rem (Roentgen Equivalent Measure, or more often<br>
millirem (mrem = 10^-3 rem) are from the FGR-11 (note 1). They can be<br>
derived from values on the ATSDR page as well. The ATSDR quoted Annual<br>
Limit on Intake (ALI) is 20000pCi/yr for "workers", and the<br>
corresponding dose limit is 5 rem/yr, giving a conversion factor of<br>
0.25 mrem/pCi (note 1), in good agreement with the standard value of<br>
0.29 mrem/pCi tabulated in FGR-11.<br>
<p>
Several expressions can be found for EPA-allowable levels of<br>
radioactivity. The ATSDR web page gives a mixture of recommended<br>
limits for the public and for "occuptional exposure" in rem, Annual<br>
Limits on Intake (ALI) in pCi/yr, and in Derived Air Concentration<br>
(DAC; pCi/m3) levels. These are generally consistent with a 10 times<br>
lower limit for the general public than for workers, but my NRC<br>
contact says the DAC's for the general public are maybe another 10<br>
times smaller than can be inferred from this web page (probably<br>
factors for time off-job as fraction of 24 hr, etc). <br>
<p>
Also, it appears that the 500 mrem annual limit for the public cited<br>
by ATSDR probably includes the unavoidable background level of 360<br>
mrem/yr from Radon gas, cosmic rays, the dentist, etc. My NRC contact<br>
thinks this would be consistent with his knowledge of an ICRP<br>
recommendation for the public of no more than 100 mrem annually above<br>
the annual background.<br>
<p>
Presume a worst case scenario involving vaporization of ALL the Pu-238<br>
that is in the RTG's. This 'astrophysical accuracy' calculation makes<br>
no allowance for removal of Pu into the ocean, by rainout, deposition<br>
onto uninhabited terrain, etc.  The 72lb of Cassini fuel is actually<br>
nearly 30% oxygen and less active Pu isotopes, so is only 50 lb Pu-238<br>
= 23 kg = 400,000 Ci (about 17 Ci/g). The volume of air in the<br>
Northern troposphere and stratosphere (which receive 99% of the Pu) =<br>
2 pi X (10 + 40) X 6000^2 km3  = 10^19 m3.<br>
<p>
Dispersion of all this vaporized Pu in the northern atmosphere gives a<br>
radiation density of about 0.04 pCi/m3, comparable to the allowable<br>
DAC. The ATSDR numbers imply that you breathe air at about 0.1<br>
liter/sec (plausible) so get 3000 m3/yr, or about 120pCi/yr. the<br>
conversion factor above (0.25) gives a 50 year dose of 30 mrem from<br>
each year of breathing this Plutonium - less than 10% of the annual<br>
background.  You'd need to breathe it for 10 years just to get the<br>
equivalent of one year of natural radiation. Meanwhile, of course, it<br>
is being lost from the system so the real numbers are far smaller. And<br>
this is using ALL the Plutonium.<br>
<p>
Looked at another way, all the Pu settles out eventually, providing<br>
2000 pCi/m2, probably over a few years. If a person has a cross<br>
section of 1 m2 and inhales ALL the fallout in this area, he gets a<br>
500 mrem 50 year dose. This is still considerably smaller than the<br>
18000 mrem we naturally receive over the same 50 year period.<br>
<p>
For comparison, 500 mrem total dose is about the same as one<br>
mammogram. Of course, most of this settling Pu misses people's noses<br>
and mouths, and if this amount of Plutonium were mixed into the top 1<br>
mm of soil, it could be shipped as non-radioactive material. And this<br>
is using ALL the Plutonium.<br>
<p>
No credible indication has ever been found of increased health risk<br>
even to the many people who worked milling Pu in the Hot and Cold War<br>
days. The only documented health effects I have been able to find are<br>
on the ATSDR web site (see references). Dogs (apparently beagles)<br>
inhaled Plutonium at a rate of 1400 - 100,000 pCi per kg body mass in<br>
a day, and suffered lung damage, even cancer, depending on dose, after<br>
several months to years.<br>
<p>
Allowing for 20 kg body mass, these dog martyrs consumed, in one DAY,<br>
amounts which would be 14 to 1000 times the average person's share of<br>
the entire Cassini Pu load as overestimated above.  The president of<br>
the Health Physics Society has himself done extensive research on mice<br>
that confirms these dog results.<br>
<p>
Vaporization of all the Plutonium is, of course, a gross overestimate.<br>
Forget (for a moment) the one-in-a-million probability that ANY kind<br>
of flyby mishap will even occur which leads to reentry and<br>
vaporization.  Even if a mishap does occur, only a tiny fraction of<br>
the Pu is able to end up in people (this is the analogue of the fact<br>
that there are enough germs in one sneeze to give a billion people a<br>
cold - it's the distribution problem that stops this from happening).<br>
<p>
The Cassini project and its consultants have done exhaustive analyses<br>
of this problem. Atmospheric incineration and ground impact have both<br>
been considered. The RTG housing itself probably does come apart under<br>
entry heating, but the triple-protected modules (2 layers of carbon<br>
composite, and an iridium cladding on each Plutonium golf ball) are<br>
extremely durable, and designed to withstand atmospheric deceleration<br>
and heating.  They hit the ground at terminal velocity - only 100-300<br>
feet/second, or one-tenth the speed of a rifle bullet.  Rifle bullets<br>
don't vaporize on impact. Neither do meteorites; they dig a little<br>
hole.  So the units might dent the hood of your car pretty badly, or<br>
make a hole in your yard, but won't spray pulverized plutonium all<br>
over your house.  All this has been tested. <br>
<p>
Factoring in these issues, the projects finds that the average<br>
expected dose (per person) is only 1 mrem over the entire 50 year<br>
lifespan of the at-risk population. Comparing this to the above upper<br>
limit of about 500 mrem/50 yr, one gets a distribution efficiency<br>
factor of about .002. If a sneeze had the same efficiency then each<br>
sneeze would give 2 million people a cold.  So the project's<br>
distribution efficiency factor, which includes the difficulty of<br>
burning through the carbon-composite and Iridium cladding of the fuel,<br>
is hardly unreasonable and actually seems quite conservative.<br>
<p>
Given the low distribution efficiency, the "average" person receives<br>
practically no Pu at all. So what's all the fuss about?  There is a<br>
very narrow range of "hot" particle sizes (about 6-10 micron radius)<br>
that is both large enough to have a significant radiation damage<br>
potential (in the range that damaged dogs' lungs) AND small enough to<br>
have any conceivable chance of being inhaled (but only a very, very<br>
small chance - see note 2).<br>
<p>
Because of the high density of the Pu (11 g/cm3), the aerodynamic<br>
radius is 11 times the actual radius. That is, cigarette smoke<br>
particles as large as 6-10 microns are inhalable with small<br>
probability (a percent or less), but Pu particles of the same size<br>
behave like 60-100 micron carbon grit. If ALL the Cassini Pu were in<br>
this 6-10 micron size range, there would be 5 E11 particles to<br>
distribute - "100 for each person" is what the critics might say.  But<br>
in reality there are enormous reduction factors that must be<br>
considered.<br>
<p>
For instance, the fraction of Pu fuel that is actually vaporized is<br>
probably less than 10%.  The fraction of all released particles that<br>
lie in the narrow hazardous size range is perhaps 1%. The fraction of<br>
Pu that ends up landing where people live (say, the 20 largest cities)<br>
is roughly their area fraction or say 0.0001. The fraction of these<br>
grit particles that are actually inhaled, because of their large<br>
aerodynamic size of about 100 microns, is also small  - surely less<br>
than 0.01 (note 2).  There is slop in these estimates, but they are<br>
plausible "delivery inefficiences" and lead to 500 inhaled "hazardous"<br>
particles worldwide, consistent with the Cassini project's far more<br>
careful estimate of 100 additional fatalities over a 50 year period.<br>
<p>
Recall that the probability of this happening in the first place is<br>
one in a million; another type of celestial mishap with the same<br>
probability, impact of a mile-wide asteroid, would kill over a billion<br>
people. Also recall that a billion people will die from cancer<br>
unrelated to Cassini during this same 50 years.<br>
<p>
The health hazard numbers are even smaller for a launch-related<br>
accident (even while it is perhaps 1000 times more "probable" at<br>
1/1500 chance of Pu-release related to launch accident), because a far<br>
smaller amount of Pu is vaporized and fewer people are exposed. The<br>
RTG's have been exhaustively tested under conditions comparable to<br>
such accidents; their Carbon-Iridium protection scheme is incredibly<br>
robust.<br>
<p>
Overall, I think the above simple arguments make the more exhaustive<br>
analysis done by the Cassini project very easy to understand and<br>
accept. The health hazard due to Cassini Plutonium really is<br>
negligible.  Statistics in the World Almanac verify that a person's<br>
risk of dying from Cassini is a million times smaller than his or her<br>
risk of a fatal auto accident while driving one mile.<br>
<p>
Notes:<br>
<p>
1) For the cognoscenti, all doses given here are effective (whole<br>
body), equivalent (radiation type independent), committed (50-year)<br>
doses (unless specified as annual). This is necessary to compare<br>
different sources of radioactivity. There are factor-of-2 or 3<br>
differences depending on how soluble the Plutonium is; the values on<br>
the web page are appropriate for "insoluble" Plutonium such as the<br>
Cassini ceramic form.  The basic constants are thus the 50-year<br>
integrated effective (whole body) damage-causing dose in mrem from a<br>
certain quantity of radioactivity in pCi.<br>
<p>
2) The human nose is 100% effective at filtering particles that are 10<br>
microns or greater and 95% effective at filtering particles over 5<br>
microns. These particles can then be excreted easily. The critical<br>
size for deposition in lung cells is 1-2 microns. Once inhaled, the<br>
material is subject to removal processes involving incoproration in<br>
mucous suspension and being swept out by the action of the cillia<br>
which line the portions of the lung which are exposed to air<br>
(Glasstone and Dolan 1977).<br>
