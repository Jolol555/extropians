Is there a compact source of such points that I can use,<br>

My reply:<br>
I don't have a specific suggestion for where to look in the literature,<br>
but concrete examples of observable evolution in action are easy to come<br>
up with on-the-fly.  Take something right out of the news today, say:<br>
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9709/16/antibiotics.ap/">http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9709/16/antibiotics.ap/</a><br>
<p>
The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a pretty clear-cut<br>
example of natural selection in action. All you need to get from there<br>
to proving that the theory of evolution *can* fully account for the<br>
diversity of life, is the occurrence of random mutations in the genetic<br>
code. Convincing the creationists that evolution *does in fact* account<br>
for the diversity of life on this rock is going to be a bit harder, but<br>
I am of the opinion that professors (especially those of philosophy)<br>
shouldn't be telling their students what is right, but instead should be<br>
teaching them the skills to critically analyze the ideas independently<br>
and decide for themselves which one is correct.<br>
<p>
I'm also curious about something--how can one justify having any sort of<br>
religious faith at all, if one takes a pancritical rationalist approach<br>
to existence?<br>
