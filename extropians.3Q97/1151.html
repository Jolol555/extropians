<i>&gt;The new York Times has</i><br>

Who needs psychedelics when things are moving this fast? There was a report<br>
in last week's New Scientist Magazine that we NOW have the ability to alter<br>
the HUMAN GERM LINE. As of last week. As I was reading the report I was<br>
sitting on the bus looking looking at out the window in a state of shock.<br>
And I couldn't tell anyone. People in general just don't get it. The report<br>
of course says that no one in their right mind would want to do it, but I<br>
guess that rules out the sanity of most of the participants on this list<br>
&lt;smile&gt;. Now that we can alter the germ line what genes would you add? Or<br>
remove? Obviously we only know a little as of yet, but there are still some<br>
interesting things we could try. Weren't their some interesting breeding<br>
experiments with fruit flies increasing the amount of an antioxidant they<br>
produced that dramatically increased their lifespans? Has this research<br>
been tried out in mammals? If you could dramatically increase the lifespan<br>
of your child wouldn't that be the trully ethical thing to do. To be frank<br>
my aliegnece is to kith-and-kin and not to  abitrary bodies whether this be<br>
governments or homo sapiens. Perhaps we really are in the last days of our<br>
race...<br>

A REAL CULTURE SHOCK<br>
Steven Dickman<br>
<p>
Human embryos carrying altered genes could become a<br>
possibility sooner than anyone thought. For the first time, a biologist<br>
claims to have grown long-lived cultures of human embryonic cells that<br>
have the capacity to develop into a wide range of tissues. The cells<br>
could find important medical applications. However, in theory, they<br>
could also be used to create genetically engineered humans.<br>
<p>
In mice, similar cultures have allowed scientists to make genetically<br>
engineered animals with unprecedented precision. The key is that the<br>
cells are "pluripotent"--they can divide and differentiate to form any<br>
tissue type. Working with a culture of these "embryonic stem cells" held<br>
in an undifferentiated state, geneticists can target genetic<br>
manipulations with much greater precision than would be possible by the<br>
haphazard injection of genes into newly fertilised mouse eggs. They can<br>
then inject the genetically engineered stem cells into an early mouse<br>
embryo. This develops into a "chimeric" mouse in which a proportion of<br>
cells in most or all of its tissues carry the altered genes.<br>
<p>
Because those tissues can include the cells that give rise to sperm and<br>
eggs, repeating these experiments in humans would break the biggest<br>
taboo in modern genetics: manipulating the human germline to induce<br>
genetic changes that can be passed down the generations.<br>
<p>
The researcher who created the human cell cultures, John Gearhart of<br>
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, stresses that altering<br>
the germline is not his goal. He hopes that the cells will find a use in<br>
conventional gene therapy, in which the altered genes cannot be<br>
inherited, or in creating tissues that could be used for grafts without<br>
the need for drugs to combat rejection. "I believe what comes out will<br>
be extremely beneficial," he says.<br>
<p>
Last week, at the 13th International Congress of Developmental Biology<br>
in Snowbird, Utah, Gearhart revealed that he now has seven separate cell<br>
lines growing in culture.<br>
<p>
To create the cultures, Gearhart took cells from fetuses roughly eight<br>
weeks into gestation, which had been aborted at a clinic in Baltimore.<br>
The cells came from a structure called the gonadal ridge, which would<br>
have developed into reproductive organs. As such, they are different<br>
from most of the embryonic stem cells used by mouse geneticists, which<br>
usually come from earlier embryos. However, Gearhart believes his cells<br>
have many of the same properties.<br>
<p>
One possibility, however, is that Gearhart's cells grow in culture in an<br>
undifferentiated state not because they are pluripotent, but because<br>
they are cancerous. But Gearhart notes that "marker" proteins carried on<br>
the surface of his cells suggest that they are pluripotent. They can<br>
also form clumps of cells that, in mouse cell cultures, are precursors<br>
to further development.<br>
<p>
The ultimate test of pluripotency would be to inject the cells into an<br>
early human embryo and show that a healthy human chimera develops--an<br>
experiment that few scientists would regard as ethical. In the absence<br>
of these data, however, other scientists say they are inclined to<br>
believe Gearhart's claim. "The science is solid and the chromosomes look<br>
fine," says Peter Gruss, a developmental biologist at the Max Planck<br>
Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen, Germany.<br>
<p>
Gearhart's cells could find applications in conventional gene therapy.<br>
Gruss says that experiments with mouse embryonic stem cells show that<br>
they can differentiate into the tissues that give rise to blood cells.<br>
If the same is true for Gearhart's human cells, it may be possible to<br>
use them to treat people with genetic diseases of the blood.<br>
<p>
Gearhart's main goal is to create cells that could be grown to form<br>
tissues suitable for grafts. If the cells were manipulated to remove<br>
genes of the major histocompatibility complex, which play a central role<br>
in the recognition of foreign tissue by the immune system, this would<br>
help solve the problem of rejection. "These cells would be the best<br>
donors," he claims. But at the back of people's minds is the possibility<br>
that human embryonic cells could be used to manipulate the germline.<br>
This would raise serious ethical concerns, says David Shapiro of the<br>
Nuffield Council on Bioethics in London, as genetic changes would be<br>
passed down to future generations without their consent.<br>
<p>
However, Anne McLaren of the Wellcome Cancer Research Campaign Institute<br>
in Cambridge, who attended the Utah meeting, questions whether anyone<br>
would attempt human germline manipulation. "No one in their right mind<br>
would want to do it," she says. McLaren notes that couples carrying<br>
genetic diseases can instead have their embryos screened through<br>
pre-implantation diagnosis and select a healthy embryo to take to term.<br>
<p>
Mario Capecchi of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, who<br>
pioneered the use of embryonic stem cells to create genetically<br>
engineered mice, says that using genetic manipulation to develop cells<br>
for transplantation would be acceptable. "But as soon as you do it to<br>
create a human being, you've crossed the line."<br>
