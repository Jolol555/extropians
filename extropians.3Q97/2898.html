<i>&gt; If we think of ethics as distilling our experience of the long-term</i><br>

<i>&gt; mistaken with the reasoning in favor of preemptive strikes.</i><br>
<p>
Well, the circumstances wherein our traditional ethical system was <br>
developed were very different from situation we will have when the <br>
first nanopower takes off. Also, I think it is unnecessary to concede <br>
too much wisdom to traditional ethical systems -- most of them are <br>
very bizzare: "Don't eat pork!", "Don't use condoms!" or rest on <br>
assumptions that most of us don't believe in (the avenging wrath of <br>
the gods).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A recent historical example would be the situation immediately after</i><br>
<i>&gt; WWII, when the U.S. had sole possession of the atomic bomb.  There was</i><br>
<i>&gt; undoubtedly debate about using this power preemptively against the USSR,</i><br>
<i>&gt; our allies during the war, but inherent ideological adversaries.</i><br>
<p>
von Neumann was in favour of a preemtive strike, and so was Bertrand <br>
Russell (who was otherwise a pacifist!) For my part, I am not sure <br>
what would have been best, given the knowledge that was available <br>
then, or even the knowledge that we have today. But an intereting <br>
fact is: it didn't happen. Perhaps it won't happen the next time <br>
either, even if that will predictably cause the end of the world.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Indeed, the cost of not conquering the Soviet Union was considerable:</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Cold War; years of mistreatment of its population and its ecology</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the Soviet government; justification of American excesses as necessary</i><br>
<i>&gt; to stop the Red menace.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, if the U.S. had preemptively attacked Russia after WWII,</i><br>
<i>&gt; destroyed it as a potential competitor for at least decades, things</i><br>
<i>&gt; might easily have been worse.  Certainly the U.S. would have been a less</i><br>
<i>&gt; trusted ally and partner in the world, more a heavy-handed, feared tyrant.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps it was just sheer luck that WWIII never happened. But <br>
somebody could argue that: "it is really only since the collapse of <br>
the Sovjet Union that USA has begun to behave virtuosly. Now it is <br>
the conscience of the world, leading the efforts to inhibit nuclear <br>
proliferation and of quenching aspiring tyrrants, like Saddam <br>
Hussein. Perhaps, if USSR had been defeated at an early stage, the <br>
USA could have been virtuous for 40 years by now, and thereby have <br>
earned the respect of the rest of the world." Who knows?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And as things turned out, the USSR eventually fell apart</i><br>
<p>
The best thing that has happened since the defeat of Hitler. I still <br>
feel joyful when I think of this event.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;, with its</i><br>
<i>&gt; countries haltingly moving towards democracy.  This is a victory for</i><br>
<i>&gt; our ethical standards, as the USSR learned that its policies were wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt; in an absolute sense, that is, they were not in accordance with nature.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Even with all the years of suffering caused by the existence of the USSR,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world is very likely a better place today than it would have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; after 50 years under a nuclear-enforced Pax Americana.</i><br>
<p>
Who knows?<br>
<p>
snip...<br>
<i>&gt; Another issue is less tangible.  It could be argued that by taking an</i><br>
<i>&gt; action which is evil, you make yourself more likely to take other evil</i><br>
<i>&gt; actions in the future.  In the nuclear American empire scenario, we can</i><br>
<i>&gt; easily imagine that after using nuclear weapons on first Japan and then</i><br>
<i>&gt; Russia, they might be used against China, Vietnam, Cuba, or any other</i><br>
<i>&gt; country which dares to resist.  It may be necessary to crack down on</i><br>
<i>&gt; dissent at home, as these outrageous actions lead to protests.  You could</i><br>
<i>&gt; end up with the worst tyranny imaginable.</i><br>
<p>
True.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Similarly, a nanotech power which is so paranoid and aggressive as to</i><br>
<i>&gt; take the step of eradicating everyone else on the planet may find it</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficult to survive on its own terms.  Paranoia would rule... snip...</i><br>
<i>&gt; The result would be a nightmare Borgism, a nearly mindless plague whose</i><br>
<i>&gt; only goal was conquest, spreading throughout the universe.  This would</i><br>
<i>&gt; all flow from that first step of destruction.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that would be a very bad outcome. In the EoC, Drexler mentions <br>
the possibility that a state choose to get rid of its people and <br>
replace them with obediant AIs. This is a real danger. -Another <br>
reason why we must make sure that no totalitarian state gets to the <br>
point where it can make a successful first strike.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Consider, in contrast, an entity which takes the harder road from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; beginning, seeking to embrace diversity and work with competitors who</i><br>
<i>&gt; are its equals.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, everybody that is willing to cooperate could be included in the <br>
dominating power. Hopefully, this would be most of the world, perhaps <br>
excluding some rogue states and possibly China. These nations would <br>
have to be forced to either cooperate or relinquish their military <br>
power. That would not mean exterminating their populations, but <br>
dissolving their military machines and doing whatever it takes to <br>
make sure they never obtain a dangerous level nanotechnology <br>
(relative to the defenses that the rest of the world has).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But the diversity which</i><br>
<i>&gt; results will be a positive benefit in and of itself.  And the need to</i><br>
<i>&gt; deal flexibly and creatively with competitors will arguably make it</i><br>
<i>&gt; better prepared to deal with surprises which the universe throws at it</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the future.</i><br>
<p>
I think this coalition would have enough diversity; but we must not <br>
forget that we can always afterward *design in* as much diversity <br>
as is desirable, whether by creating independent modules within the <br>
SI or by arranging for cultural differences in society. Diversity is <br>
something that can be manufactured. It is not something that a <br>
nanopower would need to risk its own existence to achive, or give up <br>
half of the universe for. <br>
