Well, I did write a long reply at work, but gave up after it bounced eight<br>
times. Can someone PLEASE fix the MX relay from pobox.com to extropy.org<br>
because currently any time there's no direct link to extropy.org mail<br>
bounces. Eliminating the pobox.com MX altogether would be an improvement. <br>

<p>
Hmm, I don't remember saying anything about the main features of<br>
Velikovsky's theory, other than that I don't believe it. But since you've<br>
brought this up, here's what he I understand he said, from the little of<br>
read and lots I've heard second-hand: <br>
<p>
	1. Jupiter threw out Venus<br>
<p>
Possible? Well, there could be some kind of unknown phenomenon which makes<br>
gas-giants occasionally do so; there's enough energy in the system.  So<br>
it's unlikely, but possible. <br>
<p>
	2. Venus then passed Earth several times<br>
<p>
Possible? I don't see why not if it could get into an appropriate orbit. <br>
So again, it's unlikely but possible. <br>
<p>
	3. Venus spewed out 'manna' which the Hebrews ate<br>
<p>
Possible? Maybe... a body of that size could potentially drop a lot of<br>
matter on Earth. <br>
<p>
	4. Venus caused other Biblical 'miracles'<br>
<p>
Possible? Don't know; I don't know which miracles he's talking about. <br>
 <br>
	5. Venus then settled into its current orbit.<br>
<p>
Possible? I don't see how without an interaction with a third body which<br>
was ejected from the system during that interaction. Again, possible but<br>
very unlikely. <br>
<p>
So why the hostility? I see no reason to believe Velikovsky's theory, but<br>
while it's highly improbable, it's certainly possible. Unlike, say, the<br>
perpetual motion folks, Velikovsky has claimed nothing that breaks any<br>
known law of science. So why is it that mention of him causes such a<br>
knee-jerk reaction from so many people? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I read the quotation of Robert Anton Wilson that Mark posted, and perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; I just have no sense of humor but I didn't think it was very funny.</i><br>
<p>
True; in retrospect it's lowered my opinion of Wilson a fair amount. <br>
<p>
[nuclear winter]<br>
<p>
As you say, there's nothing wrong with Sagan being wrong about nuclear<br>
winter. Equally, there's nothing wrong with desiring a nuclear freeze, but<br>
if someone wants one and produces and publicises a flawed study which<br>
supports that position you have to wonder whether their political<br>
ambitions have colored their models. See, for example, the Club of Rome. <br>
<p>
The problem is that he went out to the media and even published a book on<br>
the subject before his work had been evaluated by his peers. As a<br>
consequence even though he's wrong most people still believe what he said.<br>
Now with many people I could give them the benefit of the doubt, but Sagan<br>
was clearly smart enough and definitely media-savvy enough to understand<br>
that no later retraction could come close to matching the original<br>
sensational media coverage of his claims. Science is about truth, not<br>
popularity of ideas, and at least in this case Sagan put his desire to<br>
'spread the word' above truth. <br>
<p>
BTW, is the Paul Ehrlich who co-authored 'The cold and the dark' the same<br>
one who was predicting mass starvation in the seventies? If so, Sagan<br>
could clearly have picked better people to work with on his models. <br>
