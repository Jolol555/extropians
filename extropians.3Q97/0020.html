Yes... that is, after all, their job.<br>

You do have a cite for that, of course? I can't think of any supreme court<br>
decision which says that, except the sawn-off shotgun decision (Miller?),<br>
which seems to imply that citizen-units are allowed any weapon suitable<br>
for militia use. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The arguements as to the need for self-defense against predators in our</i><br>

enforcement<br>
<i>&gt; officials in each community. </i><br>
<p>
Even when US cops are twice as likely to kill innocent bystanders as<br>
civilians are, and when they sell guns to criminals (BATF study in<br>
Washington DC)? Even when studies have shown that legal concealed carry<br>
laws prevent crimes and save lives? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm a bit dubious as to the need of hunters for many of the rapid fire</i><br>
<i>&gt; arms that are readily available as well as the need for handguns. </i><br>
<p>
So? Where does the second amendment mention hunting? Where does it say <br>
that "the right to bear arms" doesn't include handguns?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The collected cumulitive evidence indicates that most people who claim</i><br>
<i>&gt; they need a handgun for self defense are usually incapable of using one</i><br>
<i>&gt; under siuations of stress.</i><br>
<p>
Indeed. Witness the (previously quoted) fact that US cops are twice as<br>
likely as a civilian to shoot an innocent bystander. Taking the cops' guns<br>
away would save a few hunded lives every year. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They frequently end up shooting other family</i><br>
<i>&gt; members or themselves. </i><br>
<p>
Indeed, US cops are notorious for killing themselves with their service<br>
weapons (hence the oft-quoted statistic that cops are far more likely to<br>
be shot with their own guns than by a criminal). But if you're referring<br>
to the notorious Kellerman 'study' I think you should read one of the<br>
numerous critiques. It doesn't say what you seem to think it says. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's possible that the issue of paranoia in our society is entering the</i><br>
<i>&gt; minds of some of you, as well as the numerous psycho-sexual implications</i><br>
<i>&gt; of gun collecting,</i><br>
<p>
You're really big on this "psycho-sexual" stuff, aren't you? Personally<br>
when I'm holding a gun sex is normally the last thing I'm thinking of; I'm<br>
much more concerned with safe gun-handling. Are you sure this isn't just<br>
something you're projecting on others? <br>
<p>
And you have read what Freud wrote about people who are afraid of guns,<br>
haven't you? <br>
<p>

Dear fellow extropians,<br>
<p>
I won't go into Marks highly questionable "facts" about misplaced shots by<br>
police officers. Particularly, when their is so much data about improper<br>
use of firearms under stress.<br>
I'm not particularly afraid of firearms. What I'm afraid of are all the<br>
fools who feel that they need them and who don't choose to understand what<br>
limited purposes firearms have.<br>
As far as I'm concerned, the less guns we have the better off we are.<br>
