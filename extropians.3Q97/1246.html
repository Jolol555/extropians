The Emulators<br>
<p>
<p>
Somewhere there is a world where conception and sin are intertwined,<br>
A world where each individual is forced to renounce his mind;<br>
In this world there are men who teach that novelty is a disease<br>
And that reason and logic should be controlled by authorities.<br>
Here there lay the meticulous machineries of mimicry--<br>
Tools of emulation that keep innovation from being free;<br>
In this world the machineries and tools are sanctioned by a state<br>
Whose controls are so convoluted that they bar those who create.<br>
Somewhere a world exists where intelligence is precious and rare--<br>
Where mediocrity is “freedom” and sacrifice: “debonair,”<br>
And in this world the scholars say that premises are just for fools--<br>
That order and liberty are maintained if one plays by the rules.<br>
The scariest thing is that this world is not too different from Earth<br>
Where most of the general populous has lost all sense of self-worth;<br>
Scarier still that so few see what we have the potential to be--<br>
Their sight is locked and the world must suffer until they find the key.<br>
