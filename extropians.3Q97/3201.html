<p>
&lt;&lt; That was cruel. Instead of a answer to dannys question, a slap in the<br>
 face, Ev that was not good form for a trucker, let alone a fellow<br>
 lister.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Yeah...I guess it was.. I suppose an apology is in order.<br>
<p>
Sorry about that Danny.  No excuses but.....I was irritated that day and<br>
"shot from the hip" when I saw the opportunity"....cheap shot at that.<br>
<p>
But actually it was pretty good form for a trucker....don't you listen to<br>
Barbara Walters, CRASH, Federal DOT, State DOT (particularly Tennesse and<br>
California).and all the other anti-trucking groups, government regulatory and<br>
taxing agencies?  To hear them tell it we're scum of the earth low-lifes who<br>
need to be watched every minute and regulated to the hilt...after being<br>
innundated with that type of propaganda for a while ......well.....<br>
<p>
But still....you have a point.  No promises...but I'll attempt to control<br>
myself in the future....or at least direct my remarks more appropriately.<br>
<p>
Consider it...."Evolution in Action".<br>
