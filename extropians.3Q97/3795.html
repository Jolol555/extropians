<p>
It's the pain and brain damage that are evil, not the drugs.  But I<br>
can't wave my magic wand and make the pain and brain damage go away while<br>
keeping the drugs.  There's a great deal of evil out there.  What you assign<br>
it to determines your attitude towards the drug problem, and that determines<br>
how you'll try and solve it.  If you decide that drug users are evil, you<br>
might well decide to let them all rot as long as they don't go after honest<br>
citizens ('As long as I'm not hurt...')<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;It's not my way in any case - if I go after drugs it will</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;be with bioengineered viruses,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I hope you will also take responsenbility incase of a mutation causing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; say, 11 million deaths? How will you control them from killing of humans,</i><br>
<i>&gt; livestock or crucial agricultural spiecies?</i><br>
<p>
Obviously I'm not going to take those kind of risks.  I don't see why having a<br>
virus that eats crack is any more dangerous than the common cold, which can<br>
already live in humans.  Just because I'm designing something deliberately<br>
doesn't make it more likely to get out of control.  If I started adding in<br>
immunity to penicillin, then would be a good time to start getting worried...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Have you ever read O'Rourke's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;description of a crack neighborhood?  It reads like a description of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Hell. In fact, as an SF reader, I have to say that there are quite a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;few Hells - and not lighthearted ones either - where I would rather be,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;as myself, than in a crack neighborhood as a denizen. Niven and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Pournelle's "Inferno" comes to mind, or the concentration camps of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Holocaust.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ???????? Wow... *this* from *you*</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  If I had to make a choice based on personal preference alone, and<br>
somebody said:  "You can go to a concentration camp or be addicted to crack. <br>
Choose." - then you know my choice.  I find the prospect of having my mind<br>
burnt out FAR more horrifying than being starved and tortured.  What can be<br>
done to the brain by torture and what can be done to the brain from the inside<br>
differ as much as watching something on TV and seeing it in person.  This I *know*.<br>
<p>
Frankly, I'd much rather die cleanly, and I'd be much more likely to be able<br>
to make (and carry out) that decision in a concentration camp than as a crack addict.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;I am a human first and a Libertarian second.  Would you, as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Libertarian, have kept the U.S. out of World War II, knowing that if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;did so the Holocaust would continue and Hitler would rule the world?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Why should your principles as a Libertarian stop at the U.S. border?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Don't the people ruled by dictators have rights too? Shouldn't they,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;too, be protected against their government?  Don't the Libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;principles - or any principles, taken to their logical extreme - demand</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;that one attempt to conquer the world?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In a very differnt way you seem to come to the same conclusion as I did</i><br>
<i>&gt; that any and all human-rights violations should be ended (by force if</i><br>
<i>&gt; neccecary) by a sort of world governement. Altough I would never use the</i><br>
<i>&gt; term conquer the world. Just remove the dictator and then organize</i><br>
<i>&gt; elections A.S.A.P and get out.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And I'd like their to be *lots* of controls on the UN.</i><br>
<p>
But I don't think that would work.  And no matter how urgent the ethical<br>
issue, "It wouldn't work" trumps any proposal...<br>
<p>
I simply don't think a U.N. world government would work.  Democracy has to<br>
spread a country at a time before all the democracies can be unified, and even<br>
then you'd run into trouble.  A world government is not escapable if things<br>
start going wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;So my ethical system (and, I admit, my morality) says that drugs are</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;evil,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm still confused how you came to conclude this in any rational manner.</i><br>
<p>
If we were sticking to objective ethical terms, then the pain and the<br>
burnt-out minds are what is 'evil'.  But what are you going to do about that? <br>
Be compassionate?  Anybody who considers the issue long enough will start<br>
assigning emotional-level evil and revulsion to something.  I prefer to make<br>
the choice deliberately so I can make sure I'm not targeting any human.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;it says that the crack neighborhoods are evil</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No not evil, Satan is evil, crack neighborhoods are highly undesirable</i><br>
<i>&gt; living envoronments for humans. Don't drag in all the mystical words, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; only clouds the discussion.</i><br>
<p>
If I thought I had a choice...<br>
Like it or not, humans are not completely rational.  The question is not<br>
whether you should call something evil.  The question is what.<br>
<p>
Mind you, I'm not relying on the emotional reaction for ethical justification.<br>
The pain is my justification.  What is 'evil' determines the attitude with<br>
which I approach the problem.  Previous approaches have targeted humans.  This<br>
didn't work.  Therefore, my decision is to target something else.  That's<br>
different, so it has a chance of working.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;The problem lies not within any humans but within the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;chemicals making up crack and the plants producing cocaine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If some humans want to smoke, snif or shoot-up with anything at all. You</i><br>
<i>&gt; have no right whatsoever to deny them this. If they commits crimes while</i><br>
<i>&gt; under influence, you can punish them for this. If they neglect their</i><br>
<i>&gt; children, they will lose their rights as parents. If you say crack should</i><br>
<i>&gt; remain illegal on the basis of its harmfull effect on heath you should also</i><br>
<i>&gt; prohibit:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Smoking, drinking, eating to much red-meat/fat/minerals/vitamine-C, riding</i><br>
<i>&gt; motorcycles-without-a-helmet, parachute jumping, mountain climbing, working</i><br>
<i>&gt; too hard....</i><br>
<p>
Practicality above all.  "It won't work" is sovereign.  You keep on thinking<br>
in terms of repressive governments.  I'm not blaming the humans who want to do<br>
crack.  I'm not saying that doing crack is wrong.  That approach has been<br>
tried.  I'm saying crack, and only crack, is wrong.  I am not conducting this<br>
as a paternalistic intervention to save people from themselves, which would be<br>
the default ethical-to-emotional conversion.  I am removing crack from<br>
existence.  There it ends.<br>
<p>
As for the spreading activation you describe - when there are alcohol ghettos,<br>
I'll do something about it.  There's a lot of pain in life and I can't target<br>
it all.  And mountain climbing would never be targeted, because death is not a<br>
problem in the way crack is.  Again, I am not targeting foolishness, and I am<br>
not targeting danger, and I am not targeting people doing things I don't like.<br>
I am targeting crack.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (Gosh, I'm beginning to sound like an honest-to-god-libertarian)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Consider crack to be a hostile government equipped with mind control.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Consider crack just another addictive drug whose negative effect and high</i><br>
<i>&gt; price are cause primarily by the fact that it is illegal, every time a</i><br>
<i>&gt; shipment of crack is intercepted by the governement the price goes up,</i><br>
<i>&gt; making the trade more interesting for people who have *nothing* to lose</i><br>
<i>&gt; anymore.</i><br>
<p>
I no longer care about how the crack ghettos came into existence, except to<br>
make sure it doesn't happen again.  It could be the government's fault, or the<br>
KGB's fault, or the fault of green beings from Pluto for all I care. <br>
Legalizing crack would not fix the problem, although needless to say it should<br>
be done in any case.  We must wipe crack out of existence, not just legalize it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I once saw an interview with a Colombian coke-farmer. He was asked whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; he was bothered by the fact that American teenagers die from drugs he</i><br>
<i>&gt; helped to produce. His answer: "My children are nearly starving, they could</i><br>
<i>&gt; never afford such an expensive way to die..."</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I would certainly have to consider how to support these people after<br>
depriving them of their livelihood.  It might be necessary to build a few<br>
arcologies, both to provide the ex-crack-addicts with living space and to<br>
house the farmers who have been adversely affected by my man-made natural disaster.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The people producing and distributing drugs have no reason to feel anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the western vicitms of 'their' drugs since they themselves are living</i><br>
<i>&gt; in their own hell. They will not stop producing something that has such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; profit-margin, why would they? They are taking care of themselves, just</i><br>
<i>&gt; like us.</i><br>
<p>
I don't blame them a bit!  They're people, right?  So I can't target them. <br>
And if I target their crops, then I have to compensate them for it.  They have rights.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As long as drugs remain illegal prices will remain high, trade will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting.</i><br>
<p>
"As long as drugs remain" was as far as I got in that sentence before agreeing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ask why people use drugs in the first place. The demand is the problem. Not</i><br>
<i>&gt; the supply. Addres that and you will be going some were.</i><br>
<p>
Rebuilding the economy and increasing human willpower will go a long way<br>
towards that... but it isn't enough.  The crack ghettos are now<br>
self-sustaining and no longer have root causes which I can attack indirectly. <br>
I still am not advocating a frontal attack in the current War-On-Drugs sense,<br>
but I can't use my usual elaborate indirect methods either.  There are no weak<br>
points in the cycle.  I still don't have to attack humans, either the users or<br>
growers (both of whom are my fellow humans), but I can attack the drugs, and<br>
do something about addiction.<br>
<p>
Obviously it does no good to bust up a crack ghetto at great cost, if they<br>
form again in a few weeks.<br>
<p>
Of all objections to my ideas, "It won't work" is always sovereign.  You are<br>
correct, I would need to bust up the root causes before bursting the ghetto. <br>
Like the difference between crushing an egg and a frozen egg.  But one still<br>
would need to bust the ghetto at one point or another.  As I said, it's self-sustaining.<br>
