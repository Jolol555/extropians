<i>&gt; This is a good overview, but I don't think the proposed explanation is</i><br>
<i>&gt; very convincing.  It's not clear to me how television and especially</i><br>
<i>&gt; pictures can be said to enrich the viewing environment.  We see images</i><br>
<i>&gt; every time we open our eyes which are every bit as rich as any picture,</i><br>
<i>&gt; if less artistic.  And we certainly see things move for many hours every</i><br>
<i>&gt; day, so old-fashioned television hardly adds much more stimulation.</i><br>
<p>
The key difference lies not in the richness of the pictures, nor in the<br>
fact that they are moving.  What is different is the rapidity with which a<br>
vast number of different *scenes* can be (and regularly are) thrown at the<br>
brain.  Humans are used to, say, watching the high speed chase of a lion<br>
running down a wildebeest.  Fine.  But TV lets you watch, say, a sprinting<br>
lion, then a sprinting wildebeest, then the legs of each, then a passing<br>
car, then an airplane, then a flock of birds, then the narrowing iris of a<br>
human eye, then an explosion, then a view of the earth from space, then a<br>
shot of a human sitting on a couch looking at all of this, all in a<br>
timeframe that is *amazingly* short (on the order of a couple of seconds).<br>
<p>
This is unprecedented in terms of available input to the human brain.  I<br>
don't know if this explains the Flynn Effect, but it is certainly a big<br>
difference.  I believe that if you took, say, a Bushman from the Outback of<br>
Australia, and sat him down in front of a good John Woo flick (Broken Arrow<br>
or Face/Off, for instance), there would be many scenes he simply would not<br>
be able to absorb, because he has no practice taking input at that rate.<br>
<p>
If you want an even better example, rent pretty much any Zucker Brothers<br>
Movie (Hot Shots: Deux, for instance) and any Mel Brooks movie (Robin Hood:<br>
Men in Tights, for instance), and then watch first the Zucker Brothers<br>
movie, followed by the Brooks movie.  I guarantee that you will feel the<br>
Brooks movie to be interminably slow, with punchlines coming at you only<br>
once every minute or so, rather than every few seconds, as in the Zucker<br>
Brothers movie.<br>
<p>
Probably, (wild speculation here), this trend can be traced back to before<br>
the advent of television.  Emerging forms of media have allowed us to speed<br>
up and vary our brain input in many ways, if you think about it.  Wouldn't<br>
you expect this training to have some effect on our intelligence?<br>
