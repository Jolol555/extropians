First of all, my initial post never cited the above text. I merely said,<br>
"For an interesting discussion of E-Prime see..."<br>
<p>
At the very least, I'm glad you found it interesting, if not amenable to<br>
your own views on discourse.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hmm... seems to me that the whole purpose of learning is to "immediately</i><br>
<i>&gt; produce high order abstractions". Are you against forming high order</i><br>
<i>&gt; abstractions?</i><br>
<p>
No, I agree that accurate meta-level abstractions are an important part<br>
of the learning process, not to mention the creative process. But, if<br>
they're inaccurate, I can't see how that helps you learn concrete facts,<br>
unless you ask someone about it and then they give you the correct<br>
answer. That of course assumes that there's someone around teaching you<br>
all the time. Regardless, premature judgements seem to be a bad thing<br>
for the most part. I can't say much more than that other than that what<br>
I originally wrote was: <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I must plead E-Prime on this one. To ask what man *is* suggests that man</i><br>
<i>&gt; does not *become*. Knowing one's nature and the nature of the universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; in which one exists is IMO the ultimate goal. If I can finally know what</i><br>
<i>&gt; I *am*, then I have stopped evolving. Since time doesn't stand still for</i><br>
<i>&gt; me, I become incorrect about what I *am* only a millisecond later.</i><br>
<p>
E-prime is useful in this situation only in that it avoids the incorrect<br>
meta-level abstraction that humanity *is* one thing or many things, and<br>
therefore the premature judgement that it *is* that thing forever. I<br>
don't think its possible, or even desirable to make e-prime a religion.<br>
