     After perusing Robin Hanson's work "If Uploads Come First" (and I do <br>
     plan to give it a more concerted read when it's not competing with my <br>
     first listen of Kenny Loggins' new CD &lt;G&gt;), I began doing some <br>
     surfing.  I'm planning to add "Escape Velocity" to my list of upcoming <br>
     reads (a speed reading course is starting to sound practical right <br>
     about now).<br>
     I came across a URL with an article by Andrew Brown entitled "How to <br>
     make a soul":<br>
     <br>
     "There is no doubt that the process of learning from the outside is <br>
     getting better and better. You can use a brain scanner to look inside <br>
     someone's head while he learns a poem or recites one back. You can see <br>
     which parts of the brain are working, and how hard. But even if these<br>
     scanners could track each signal in each of the brain's billions of <br>
     cells, they would still not explain why that activity should feel the <br>
     way it does. People may, someday, be able to find which pattern of <br>
     neurons firing makes up a thought. But what does that tell you about   <br>
     consciousness, about the feeling of the thought? "<br>
     <br>
     I think that the last statement is definitely the rub for me and my <br>
     particular hold out in jumping on the pro-popcicle brigade <br>
     (condescension would be interpreted, just being whimsical).  I don't <br>
     particularly desire being convinced and I don't mind being regarded as <br>
     a foolish traditionalist who blithely accepts the fate dealt to the <br>
     billions before this generation with its potentially life-extending <br>
     technologies: the uploading of consciousness, the cryogenic suspension <br>
     of physical matter, etc..  <br>
     <br>
     Are thoughts just states and balances of chemicals, suspended neurons <br>
     who are firing at a precise frequency and/or wattage.  I don't have <br>
     scientific terms to offer here.  But I am left cold (no pun intended, <br>
     well, yes, now that I think of it, it works...&lt;G&gt;) by the notion that <br>
     any part of me could be reanimated and the "me" that commanded the <br>
     body would just return to a conscious state.  Presumably, "I" would <br>
     have the same lack of awareness of time passing as when I hit my <br>
     snooze for a few extra minutes of pre-awakening bliss only to hear the <br>
     radio blast after what seems like a few seconds.<br>
     <br>
     Perhaps these topics have been ground down to their banal fundamentals <br>
     in this digest and maybe I have some more research to do before I so <br>
     casually dismiss the fervor of the life extension proponents.  <br>
     <br>
     Rick  <br>
