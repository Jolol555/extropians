Kathryn Aegis and ard-AGAPE discuss the demarcation of Eros, Agape, <br>
sexualitiy, coercion and consent, and the intimate interactive exchange of <br>
conscious contact -- and shared sensual experience -- and intelligent <br>
interconsciousness betwwen people.<br>
<p>
Here are some case histories:<br>
<p>
Avedon Carol was discussing her being molested, raped and beaten, and her <br>
discovery of the joys of discovering the joys of masturbation for herself <br>
at the age of six.<br>
<p>
<p>
Avedon; &gt; I will admit that I cannot honestly say I gained nothing from <br>
<i>&gt; being raped.  I did learn things about myself that I now consider to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; valuable.</i><br>
<p>
Anduril &gt; Ferinstance?<br>
<p>
Avedon &gt; I do think it is a mistake to assume that a person is "ruined for<br>
<i>&gt;life" as the result of a sexual assault/abuse.</i><br>
<p>
To which I responded: (All of the following is true, BTW)<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
Anduril &gt;Well, Avedon, I was subjected to a sexual assault as a child, in our<br>
local woods where I was playing, by a youth who was later given a custodial<br>
sentence for the offence.  I don't remember much, except that I hated running<br>
home over sharp stones on unpaved roads with no shoes and socks on (the guy<br>
had taken them away to slow me down).  I learned (again) that people can do<br>
things to you if they're bigger and stronger than you are.  'Ruined'?  Nope.<br>
<p>
<p>
    I was much more upset by having creosote thrown in my face (blinding <br>
me for three days) when I was 9 or 10.  The attacker was never identified. <br>
But 'ruined'?  Nope.  Unless I'd been permanently blinded, as they feared <br>
I might have been.<br>
<p>
<p>
    I was even more upset by being repeatedly and viciously caned on the<br>
outstretched fingers of my left hand at primary school (making it impossible<br>
to write or play the piano for days at a time), in a -- failed -- attempt to<br>
make me right-handed.  Every time i involuntarily moved my outstretched <br>
hand, 'that stroke didn't count.' I don't recall anyone suggesting <br>
prosecuting the headmaster who did it.  'Ruined'?  Nope.  He did die soon after, ISTR...<br>
<i>&gt;:-}</i><br>
<p>
At Dulwich College, aged 11 and 12, we had to swim naked (for unexplained <br>
reasons), while the prefects 'talent-spotted' from the balcony.<br>
<p>
<p>
    I was even less pleased when, at Dulwich College, we were subjected to<br>
what I guess we'd have to call two-hour sessions of protracted ritual <br>
torture, for the sexual gratification of the prefects who were doing it to <br>
us, with other prefects looking on, doing things under the newspapers <br>
covering their laps.  Some of the better-looking kids were tortured until <br>
they agreed to provide passive and active sexual services to the prefects. <br>
I'm a bit upset that these same prefects have gone on to 'run the country' <br>
now.  But 'ruined' by it? Nope.  Killing them, OTOH...<br>
<p>
<p>
    I was really angry when, at Geelong Grammar School in Australia, aged 16,<br>
the school authorities set out to destroy my (non-physical) emotional<br>
relationship with a younger boy, aged 14, who had become fond of me.  They<br>
leaned heavily on me, which was totally unproductive, so they set to<br>
repeatedly caning _him_, until he became physically incapable of even talking<br>
to me.  This I consider _unforgiveable_.<br>
<p>
<p>
I was given a three-day ultimatum a fortninght before my University <br>
entance exams, that I should submit to being beaten by Robin Gorton and <br>
his house prefects in the _showers_ (not, note carefully, in his study...)<br>
<p>
I'm writing a (screen)play on this.<br>
<p>
    I was more worried by what 'the authorities' were doing to kids all the<br>
while; personality-ablation electroshock; psychosurgery; drug 'treatments';<br>
incarceration in 'institutions'; kidnapping them into 'care' institutions<br>
then shipping them off to the middle of nowhere in Canada and Australia to<br>
build the 'White Commonwealth' (this until the mid-Sixties!).  These things<br>
could have ruined my life (they did for tens of thousands).<br>
<p>
    And all the while, I was growing up under the shadow of military<br>
conscription ('National Service'!) where the military could (try to) destroy<br>
your very identity by gross coercion.  I might have volunteered to be a RAF<br>
pilot, but I'd have killed to avoid conscription.  This could have 'ruined my<br>
life', I guess.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe it just goes a long way in helping to evade the issues that</i><br>
<i>&gt; were raised by the rape/abuse in the first place.</i><br>
<p>
    All too true.<br>
<p>
Tony<br>
