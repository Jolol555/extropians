	perhaps ... like i said, life contains bad experiences and<br>
	they can help mold you in a positive way ... i wouldnt want<br>
	to change anything thats happened to me thusfar in life,<br>
	even though i've experienced things that i wouldn't wish<br>
	on anybody.<br>
<p>
	as far as "getting used to bullies" and whatnot, i simply removed<br>
	myself from all those idiots when i graduated from high school<br>
	here in rural Pennsyltucky and haven't had to deal with many of<br>
	those issues since.  i would rather that my children not deal<br>
	with them at all.  <br>
<p>
	i mean, lets face it ... my children are not going to be all like<br>
	me, regardless of how i raise them or would like them to become.<br>
	time, location, technology, weather, political environment, etc.<br>
	etc. will always have their impact.  the less bullshit that lies<br>
	between them and the goal of thoughtful, caring, intuitive,<br>
	strong, extropian human beings the better.<br>
<p>
	there are definitely better ways to learn courage than the often<br>
	times alarming and coercive environment of (American) public<br>
	schools.<br>
<p>
	ah, we could go back and forth like this 'till we go blue in the<br>
	face!<br>
<p>
		take care,<br>
