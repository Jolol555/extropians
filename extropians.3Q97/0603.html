Much of which (according to articles I've read by pilots) is imposed by<br>
the government and not really neccesary for safe operation. Even then,<br>
from reading some of Richard Bach's books, the amount of maintenance<br>
required to keep his biplane operational was far higher than that required<br>
for his jets, *and* it crashed more often. <br>

Isn't that what you have a shield there for? I mean, do you really believe<br>
that any alien race is going to travel from system to system in a<br>
spacecraft that will be considerably damaged by the mere act of travel? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How do you stop? SOrry, you've got to turn that mutha around and brake</i><br>
<i>&gt; for as long as you've been accelerating. That puts your ass end open to</i><br>
<i>&gt; reentry through an alien solar systems Oort cloud.</i><br>
<p>
Uh, yes. Just like reentry with the shuttle, only worse. This is why I <br>
think your figure of 0.98c is much higher than they're really use (and <br>
way off the scale for the kind of early mission they talked about).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For starters, the shuttle orbits at a mere 17,000 mph, and it still</i><br>
<i>&gt; breaks down half the time, causing the mission to be cut in half.</i><br>
<p>
Firstly, note I said 'qualitatively', not 'quantitatively'. We all know<br>
that the shuttle is a massive boondoggle full of cut-price engineering and<br>
frankly I'm surprised it works at all. Even then it's only been called<br>
back early two or three times (not the 50% you mentioned) and the first<br>
time was an early test flight when things were expected to go wrong. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't do that on an interstellar mission. "Oops, Snorf, we busted the</i><br>
<i>&gt; toilet, we've gotta turn around...."</i><br>
<p>
When have NASA ever brought the shuttle back because of a broken toilet? <br>
AFAIR all those aborts were due to broken fuel cells, and the mission<br>
could have happily continued without them were it not for NASA's paranoia. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Buddy, you are talking to someone who has worked on the best we've</i><br>
<i>&gt; got, and they still wear out, and still crash. Expecting your godlike</i><br>
<i>&gt; aliens to be any different is pure delusion.</i><br>
<p>
But you're still talking about military aircraft, not commercial (and I'd<br>
agree that if this were the first flight that might be a valid comparison,<br>
I just don't think that it would be). And you're talking to someone who<br>
worked as a military avionics designer, so I know more than a little about<br>
the badly designed military maintenance programs that I talked about. I'll<br>
just get into trouble if I *do* talk about them. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is nothing badly designed about them. They are doing their best</i><br>
<i>&gt; with what they can get.</i><br>
<p>
Precisely; and they could get a lot better for the same price, if they <br>
speced it right in the first place.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Lockheeds skunk works had a few dozen geniuses</i><br>
<i>&gt; who made things work right the first time. That kind of skill is a wee</i><br>
<i>&gt; precious commodity that regualr service cannot afford in any but</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely special circumstances.</i><br>
<p>
However, the people who were looking after the Blackbirds weren't those<br>
geniuses, they were just normal Lockheed technicians. The main differences<br>
(from what I've been told) were in training, motivation and longevity; <br>
the Lockheed crew were there *because* they wanted to work on those planes<br>
and stayed with them for years whereas the Air Force crew were just posted<br>
there and moved on a couple of years later. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We had</i><br>
<i>&gt; the highest utilization rate in the USAF TAC the first year I was there,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and had not lost a plane in over ten years (we had lost an F-106 a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; months before they were retired in 1979). Our unit was deactivated in</i><br>
<i>&gt; January of 1990.</i><br>
<p>
An impressive record!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The CIA also did not have the operating environment militarily that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; USAF did. By the time the USAF took over, the Soviets had developed</i><br>
<i>&gt; missiles capable of catching the plane, which required the development</i><br>
<i>&gt; of EW units for the plane.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, the CIA were using EW units on their U2s, so I don't see why they'd<br>
have any great problems using them on the Blackbirds. I don't know whether<br>
they were using them prior to the handover and can't check at the moment. <br>
