<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it would be cool for someone at extropy.org to set up</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; an email alias for this. If our team were to crack it, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I can contribute the use of 5 Pentiums (from 90 to 266Mhz).</i><br>
<p>
You can add four of mine, but I think we can do even better.<br>
Rather than settling for $1,000 from Bovine, why not go after<br>
the $10,000 directly?  I realize that would take writing our<br>
own software, and duplicating effort with them a bit, but we've<br>
got lots of cypherpunks here too and might be able to write<br>
better software.<br>
<p>
If that's too much trouble or less likely to produce the result,<br>
then getting in on Bovine's deal isn't so bad (for those who<br>
haven't or cannot check out the page referred to, Bovine is a<br>
group that wrote software and is coordinating an effort to win<br>
the $10,000 offered for cracking RSA.  For their efforts, they<br>
will keep $1,000, give $1,000 to the fellow that actually finds<br>
to contest key (which we are proposing here to donate to Max),<br>
and the remaining $8,000 to Project Gutenberg).<br>
