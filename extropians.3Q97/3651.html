Frederick Mann:<br>
<i>&gt;"I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the </i><br>
<i>&gt;sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine." </i><br>
<i>&gt;John Galt in 'Atlas Shrugged' by Ayn Rand</i><br>
<p>
Is John Galt really talking about benevolence here?  This passage seems to <br>
refer to values of loyalty or subservience.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That someone says, "I have no obligation to help another," says </i><br>
<i>&gt;absolutely nothing about whether that person has compassion or not.</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  In fact, social scientists who study benevolence rarely link <br>
the two, because a new view of benevolence is emerging.  Within the <br>
context of the set of personal or group relationships affected by it, <br>
an act of benevolence can be viewed as an investment with a <br>
future return, as a method of cementing community relationships, or <br>
as a method of expressing one's social status.  One could go so far <br>
as to state that no one gives anyone anything without some <br>
expectation of some sort of tangible or intangible future return, <br>
thus calling into question the entire concept of compassion.  The <br>
idea of compassion may be a holdover from earlier times when we <br>
humans did not fully understand (or want to face!) our own <br>
motivations for acting in a benevolent manner.  <br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
