<i>&gt;&gt;The gay</i><br>

individualism.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm sorry, Natasha, but all current evidence runs against your </i><br>
<i>&gt;statement.</i><br>
<p>
Your current evidence takes the slant of making a living in society where I<br>
was referring to social acceptance of gays.  Surely there are those who are<br>
pigeon holed in unprogressive thinking, but on a whole progress happens<br>
regardless of those who are antagonistical to it.<br>
<p>
There is evidence to show discrimination against many areas of professional<br>
society especially in work-related areas.  Regardless of this fact, the gay<br>
community has created a voice for itself and that voice is surely being heard. <br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The staff of national gay organizations, which I interact with </i><br>
<i>&gt;on a regular basis, would dearly like to take a break and would give </i><br>
<i>&gt;almost anything to have the kind of power and influence you mention.  </i><br>
<p>
Is is beginning to and will continue to.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Violence and social approbabation, losing one's job and housing are </i><br>
<i>&gt;the daily realities for gay persons all over the globe.  Yes we have </i><br>
<i>&gt;made progress, but it is slow, hard-won, and easily lost.  Even in </i><br>
<i>&gt;the field of the arts, which I assume you may be using as an example, </i><br>
<i>&gt;gay art is often ghettoized, and many remain in the closet to keep </i><br>
<i>&gt;their jobs.</i><br>
<p>
However true, these are concerns for many areas of discrimination.  The<br>
field of arts didn't play a part in my thinking probably because the "arts"<br>
are basically less gender conscious than most fields.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Yes, I see much hope ahead, also a lot of work, but </i><br>
<i>&gt;work that none of us would take on if we didn't see the chance to </i><br>
<i>&gt;make a better life.  </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am sorry that this does not sound as </i><br>
<i>&gt;optimistic as your above statement, but I would rather develop an </i><br>
<i>&gt;optimism that deals with things as they really are and where we have </i><br>
<i>&gt;the most chance of making a better life.</i><br>
<p>
No one is assuming that in order to look ahead one needs to be unrealistic.<br>
<p>
The basic facts are that the gay community is more widely known, heard and<br>
understood than 10 years ago.  Twenty years from now, it a lot of the social<br>
problems will be non-issues.  There may be other problems, just as in other<br>
areas of society, and these will be dealt with in time.<br>
<p>
I understand your concern and dismay at chipping away at a seemingly<br>
impenetrable wall. <br>
