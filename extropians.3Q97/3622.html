<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; You cannot justify your statement about the nature of the pace of change</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; simply by saying it a fact of life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Huh? I wasn't justifying anything.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's my point. The latter sentence appears to be readable as both a</i><br>
<i>&gt; corollary and explanation of the former sentence. But, whether or not that</i><br>
<i>&gt; is your intention, these statements lack justification, and that's not</i><br>
<i>&gt; something that sits well on this list: people tend to like 'I think...' to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be followed by 'because...'</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Cancer is a fact of life. Death is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; fact of life. Bigotry is a fact of life. They are all problems and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; believe they all need to be solved. I'm not necessarily disagreeing with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; you, just asking you for a cogent argument.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If you don't disagree then you don't need any argument, cogent or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I didn't say that I agreed or disagreed: I'm trying to decide whether or</i><br>
<i>&gt; not I agree, and it would help me in doing that to know the reasoning</i><br>
<i>&gt; behind your statement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Anyway, sorry for being pedantic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't be, it is oftn the essence of good argument :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The problems you cite are indeed problems. They are also facts of life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The pace of change is not a problem, but it is a fact of life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I must be missing your point because if you don't disagree then what are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you doing?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; See above. You have not convinced me that the pace of change is not a problem.</i><br>
<p>
Oh. I hadn't tried to do that. <br>
<p>
My reason for concluding that the pace of change is not a problem is<br>
that it will lead directly to a singularity (see Dan's or Eliezer's web<br>
pages for arguments concerning this). If you believe the singularity is<br>
a problem too, then you will probably be in favor of slowing the pace a<br>
bit. Now whether a singularity is problematic is difficult to predict.<br>
One thing is likely, and it is from this that I have decided to accept<br>
the singularity as a subjective "good thing," the world will probably be<br>
more extropic afterwards. For an example, one need only look at the<br>
possible applications of nanotech. I'm not a scientist but massive<br>
increases in computing power, super-high bandwidth data transfer,<br>
possible augmentation of humans, possible AI sentience, etc., seem<br>
possible. None of these post-singularity applications are guaranteed,<br>
and most are damn scary to me. However, since I value extropy, I also<br>
value complexity, intelligence, information, capacity for improvement,<br>
etc. I think that a post-singularity world will find these have<br>
increased dramatically.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I say speed them up so I can augment my inefficent physical form with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;something more capable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; It seems a little naive to assume that increases in the pace of change, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; even continued change should allow you to do anything at all about your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; form. Will you be able to afford it? Will you have access to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; technology? Will you even hear of the developments?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Ancillary questions, don't you think?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Whether I can opt for augmentation or not is irrelevant to the question</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of whether augmentation is available, no? If the pace of change is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;slowed, then I might not have even the option, never mind how much it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;costs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, not ancillary in the slightest. Indeed, since your standpoint is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; such developments are inevitable, your access to them should be your</i><br>
<i>&gt; _primary_ question.</i><br>
<p>
Not if I'm dead before we get them.<br>
<p>
You're putting a new (practical) spin on this. I thought the original<br>
thread was concerning the pace of change in the marketplace and its<br>
effect on people such as Holly Pearson. My point was, the pace of change<br>
that is killing her, is also the pace of change that will save her.<br>
<p>
So, it would be nice to slow things down (somehow -- government<br>
regulation?) and give everyone breather. But as Dan Clemmenson points<br>
out on his web page, that would deny the benefits of new technologies to<br>
those who die in the interim.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;You are insignificant. So am I.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; This is not a very Extropian attitude.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I nearly became sarcastic. I wonder why you think so? Oh, wait, here's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the reason:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; We may not be owed anything by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; anyone but that does not have the corollary of insignificance. And if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; truly desire change, insignificant is one thing we cannot _afford_ to be,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; either as individuals or as a group.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This doesn't tell me anything about whether we are insignificant or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Whether I can afford to be insignificant in the face of the universe is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;not the question I was addressing. If I am significant, then express</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not trying to tell you whether or not you are significant now. What I</i><br>
<i>&gt; am saying is that, if we are insignificant, we cannot afford to remain so,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Your phrasing had rather fatalistic overtones, which conveyed a feeling</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we are insignificant and that's that.</i><br>
<p>
You are significant to your pets. You are significant in your home,<br>
neighborhood, maybe town, possibly even in your country. In fact a<br>
limited number of people are significant to the world. But in the long<br>
history of your universe, you are insignificant. It's tough to swallow<br>
sometimes. One thing is likely though, slowing the pace of change will<br>
almost certainly not help you become more significant in this universe.<br>
For the reasons I suggested above, it seems that slowing the pace is<br>
less extropic than accelerating it. The more extropic you are, I tend to<br>
think, the more significant you are to the universe. <br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; The tools for my survival are on their way.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; To people with money, and friends in high places, and influence, of whom</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; you and I have probably never heard. Unless we do something to involve</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; ourselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The tools for *MY* survival are on their way. I didn't include anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;but me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Are they? It would be in the spirit of the list if you told us what they</i><br>
<i>&gt; were, how they operate and how you propose to obtain them.</i><br>
<p>
You've been on this list longer than I have. Af for the first two<br>
questions the ExI page goes into some aspects of intelligent technology.<br>
As for how they would work, I haven't the faintest. Science is a hobby,<br>
but I'm not the one who's going to build the first assembler.<br>
<p>
As for how I propose to obtain them, my initial concern is that they<br>
exist before I die. I can only do those things that are within my power<br>
at this point. As a law student, I'm beginning to carve my<br>
interdisciplinary academic niche within law and technology, with my<br>
first project on the legal implications of nanotech. We must not impede<br>
the pace of progress in these technological areas.<br>
<p>
As for after they exist, who knows how any of us are going to get them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Actually,</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps this is a sterling test for the disposition of Extropians. Is it</i><br>
<i>&gt; every person for him/herself, or will we share our knowledge even in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; face of potential competition?</i><br>
<p>
Extropy is not a secret. I'd be willing to bet you won't be the one who<br>
builds the first assembler either. You better hope someone shares their<br>
knowledge.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;No one has any better chance than any other. All your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;money, all your resources may be rendered worthless at the Singularity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Hmmm. 'And He shall judge them one and all at the great Singularity, when</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; all shall be equal.' Om.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Well said.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Notice my use of the construction "may be".</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Are you arguing with me, or just being clever?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, I would hope both. Perhaps I missed the subtlety of 'may be'; it just</i><br>
<i>&gt; seemed that your were undermining your own statements with a final, "In the</i><br>
<i>&gt; end it doesn't matter what we do, because the singularity is going to 'get</i><br>
<i>&gt; us all'."</i><br>
<p>
I wasn't.<br>
