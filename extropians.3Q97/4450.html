This, of course, begs the question.  The anarcho-(socialist,<br>
syndicalist, communist) claim is that property, such as owning a car<br>
which isn't used 90% of the time, or land you've never even visited when<br>
there are landless peasants starving in megacity slums, is theft and<br>
coercion.  So they would say "the 'right' wouldn't survive without<br>
utilizing coercion (oxymoron!), or adapting socialist techniques."<br>
Socialist techniques such as<br>

I've noticed that when I run into The Usenet Libertarianism Thread (pick<br>
a newsgroup, any newsgroup) I reliably find a bunch of ranting<br>
libertarians and a bunch of ranting statists.  Sometimes there are some<br>
sophisticated libertarians, and/or sophisticated statists.  And<br>
sometimes there'll be one old libertarian, a 19th century propertyless<br>
anarchist, and he always seems quite sophisticated.  Still can't explain<br>
how his economy is supposed to work, but his criticisms of reality and<br>
everyone else are usually cogent.  Usually far too cogent for the<br>
ranters; they don't even perceive that they're being hit.  A good old<br>
anarchist arguing with your typical Econ 101 libertarian or Randroid is<br>
like a biologist and the typical fundamentalist arguing over evolution;<br>
the latter just doesn't get it.<br>
<p>
I agree with the biologist more than I do with the anarcho-socialist,<br>
but a simplistic defense of libertarianism serves no good purpose.<br>
