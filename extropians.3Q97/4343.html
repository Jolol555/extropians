Hi!<br>
<p>
Probably you've noticed I already commented on some issues you focused<br>
in your post but I only had time to reply to the rest now (and I still<br>
think it's much incomplete). Also, I saw that you already replied to my<br>
yesterday's message but I don't have the time to read it right now (I've<br>
seen it's pretty long) and will therefore reply to you on a later<br>
occasion (tomorrow or Friday). This applies a few other messages to<br>
which I wish to reply to.<br>
<p>
Let's kick off, you wrote:<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Hi!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;</i><br>
<p>
What does this mean (just for curiosity)?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You think our gene pool is roughly the same as France centuries ago?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously you haven't been here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; People of Euro-descent are a minority at my university.</i><br>
<p>
Actually I have been in Canada, I've been in Toronto, Montreal, Quebec,<br>
the east coast of Canada and they seemed pretty European to me. Anyway,<br>
does that really matters? What if they're from Mexico, remember the<br>
bloodlust of the Mexican - many - revolutions? What if they're from<br>
Africa, have you read the latest events in Africa, do you think it's a<br>
peaceful continent? What if they're from China, do you know what<br>
happened to approximately 500'000 orphans in China in the past few<br>
decades? Is it really that important to know where your gene pool comes<br>
from? I used Canada like I could have used Japan (I don't need to write<br>
any examples, you surely studied History) or any other peaceful (I mean<br>
by peaceful, in this context, a low crime rate) country.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sorry, this comparison doesn't work.  The Napoleonic Code is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; father-document of modern law.  Napoleon's empire was far from</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarianism/anarcho-capitalism.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps I was wrong when I said you studied History. I remember reading<br>
a few soldier's stories of the battle of Austerlitz (one of Napoleon's<br>
biggest victories), when the French army advanced to the main hill, the<br>
order was to take no prisoners, all enemy soldiers were killed, that<br>
included wounded and mutilated enemy soldiers. I can try to find a few<br>
other macabre stories of the Russia campaign. Other thing, this<br>
comparison was meant to try to explain my views over human nature and<br>
not economical issues.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I find your statement that violence is human nature completely ridiculous.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Europe is a bad example because it has always been violent.  Instead, look</i><br>
<i>&gt; at a place like Tibet.  In the far distant past, they were considered the</i><br>
<i>&gt; most violent civilization on earth.  They were bloodthirsty and militant.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They would kill their own warriors on a dime for discipline.  Overnight,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they became what I would call the most peaceful civilisation on earth.  No</i><br>
<i>&gt; government brought around this change, nor was their any great amount of</i><br>
<i>&gt; education available(beside the teaching of Buddha)  Certainly, their</i><br>
<i>&gt; education was of a lesser quality than many of the violent countries that</i><br>
<i>&gt; exist today.  What does this say about human nature?</i><br>
<p>
It says that through education you can turn a wild beast like the<br>
ancient Tibet into a peaceful, lovely pussy cat. You are making a huge<br>
mistake by underestimating the religious principles and education that<br>
made this change possible. Things don't usually happen for no reason,<br>
and it Tibet's case, religion, that so many wars and violence has<br>
caused, was the key to the change. This was not overnight, it took some<br>
time.<br>
<p>
One more thing, Europe has always been violent?!?! You've got to be<br>
kidding, the quality of life and safety of countries such as Sweden,<br>
Norway, Finland, Denmark, even France and Germany (if you exclude some<br>
of the bigger cities), amongst others, are at the top of the world. You<br>
can argue that if their life quality decreased, violence would happen<br>
but then you would be agreeing with me because you would have to agree<br>
that education and prosperity are the cause for peace and not human<br>
nature.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think it says that human nature is a very illusive thing, soon to</i><br>
<i>&gt; eradicated entirely.  Some people live to eat other human beings, some</i><br>
<i>&gt; people live to serve other human beings(not for dinner!)  What is natural?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is a beaver's dam natural?  Is the Hoover Dam natural?  Does it even</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter?  We're all in the same universe, why do we need a nature, and how</i><br>
<i>&gt; can you see it so clearly? </i><br>
<p>
A nature is, like the name says, a natural state. IMHO (as well as many<br>
psychologists), there is a great diversity in human mentalities but this<br>
is due to environmental factors, namely, education. No-one knows for<br>
sure how is the human nature, all we can do is extrapolate from the<br>
reality we have. That is what I do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; People will do bad things, and intrude on others freedoms.  The question</i><br>
<i>&gt; is, do you think it is justified for a governing agency to impede on</i><br>
<i>&gt; EVERYONE'S freedom, to stop these "bad" people?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I do. A friend of mine was telling me the other day about the lack<br>
of individual privacy in our society (have you read Gianni Vattimo's<br>
"The Transparent Society"?) and how that worried him because when<br>
searching for a job the employer could find things about his privacy,<br>
like his health, that would prevent him to get the job. I don't agree<br>
with him, I fear no-one and the more the employer knows about me, the<br>
more certain will I get the job (yes, I'm incredibly optimist, some call<br>
it boast). I have nothing to hide and an institution needs to interfere<br>
with my freedom to prevent crime, fine with me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How bad do you think people really are?</i><br>
<p>
OK, I'll give some good arguments so that you stand a chance in this<br>
debate. During world war 2, many (I don't remember exactly but it was<br>
about 50%) American soldiers never fired a shot at the enemy, they would<br>
fire to the air or would just do behind the front works. Incidentally<br>
this percentage dramatically decreased in Vietnam because of the<br>
exhaustive psychological training the US army gave to the soldiers.<br>
Another beautiful story was one of some 17th or 18th century battle (I<br>
also don't remember exactly, I can look for it, if you want) in which<br>
many muskets were found, after the battle, to be loaded dozens of times.<br>
Which means soldiers would load up their muskets but wouldn't fire at<br>
the enemy. I think this shows what is usually called humanity, the<br>
question is, is it natural (part of the human nature) or is it<br>
environmental (through education)? Unfortunately for your line of<br>
reasoning, I don't know of any stories of such kind happening in the old<br>
anarchy of the barbarians but, you can still argue that education made<br>
this violent men, in this case, through a terrible childhood. Have you<br>
ever heard of the Romanian orphans that were taken to the army, they<br>
were ruthlessly educated and would then become beasts to serve the army<br>
in some "bad moments". Another example is the city of Sparta. Well, you<br>
should be the one telling me this arguments and not the other way<br>
around, dig it up yourself, this is just to show you that I don't talk<br>
without any base knowledge and that I try not to have a manichaean<br>
position.<br>
<p>
Answering your question, I find people are as bad as society let's them<br>
be.<br>
<p>
Now it's your turn, what do you think about human nature? What do you<br>
think human nature is? Do you think our personalities are genetic or<br>
shaped by the years? <br>
<p>
Well, I'm not saying everything I should, I think there are a few points<br>
in my argument which I haven't explained very well but we'll continue<br>
another day, I'm tired, I had classes all day, soccer in the late<br>
afternoon (yes, lost more neurons) and you're probably fed up with me<br>
anyway. See ya jovem,<br>
