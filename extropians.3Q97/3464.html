<p>
Or maybe there are a lot of working definitions of 'Facism' around.<br>
Facism does not mean Nazism, it's about putting the interests of the group<br>
(fasci - Italian word) ahead of the individual. Also in such an arangement<br>
stronger individuals often have more rights than weaker ones.<br>
Thing are further complicated by the fact that there's no 'manual' on<br>
facism as there is on communism (you know, the one by Marx)<br>
<p>
But I'm not even saying these persons would be right, that's not the point.<br>
<p>
The point I was trying to make (but maybe not vey clearly) is that there is<br>
no clear border of criminal behaviour and acting as a free entity in a free<br>
market.<br>
(This in reply to your discussion with somebody about the accountability of<br>
the tobacco-industry for the health-effect of smoking)<br>
<p>
There's just the effect of culture, situation and upbringing. We all draw<br>
al arbritrary line in the sand and then one side represents the rights of<br>
an individual and the other side is labeled as criminal behaviour.<br>
<p>
There is *no* fundamental good or evil, just a lot of cultural conventions.<br>
<p>
Example: euthanasia is illegal in most country's, but is becoming accepted<br>
in some and has been practised by the Eskimo's for thousands of years.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I think you're sitting up a straw man...naming it "Free Market</i><br>
<i> &gt;Economy"...ascribing all kinds of terrible things to it...and saying it</i><br>
won't<br>
<i> &gt;work.</i><br>
<p>
With a Darwinian Economy I meant an economy without any ethical rules or<br>
law-enforcing organisation (like a state). I'm not saying it won't work, I<br>
think it would work very well (that was what the post was all about). But I<br>
find the side-effect of such a system much too high.<br>
<p>
This week has been most interesting, funny to see how my (in retrospect<br>
rather naive) post about the kidney-nappers exploded into a whole series of<br>
political threads ;-)<br>
