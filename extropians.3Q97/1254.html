Hmm... perhaps I'm dull, but I thought that Darrow and Tipler had<br>
built up a fairly convincing explanatory answer to these questions<br>
in their book THE ANTHROPIC COSMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE. I mean, it may<br>
not be very satisfying to learn that these things are the way they<br>
are because of a selection effect (I think the Anthropic Principle<br>
dovetails quite beautifully with the Many Worlds interpretation,<br>
though), but even if I wasn't rock-bottom convinced (and I wasn't),<br>
these questions became far less interesting to me after I had read<br>
the book.<br>
<p>
(There's also a neat little chart on the web, pointed out here<br>
recently by Steve Witham, at <a href="http://www.sns.ias.edu/~max/toe.html">http://www.sns.ias.edu/~max/toe.html</a><br>
that makes things a bit more concrete.  "The figure below illustrates<br>
how little one needs to change some aspects of our world to make<br>
it hostile to life...")<br>
<p>
(Note: just because I like the Anthropic Principle doesn't mean I<br>
entirely approve of Tipler's more recent plucking at Tommaso Aquino's<br>
laurels.  I can't imagine why Tipler's going into competition with<br>
a rationalizer of witchburning.)<br>
