Robin Hanson:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;This quote says only that gender *is* constructed, which I have not</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;disputed.  It does not address my question, which is why social</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;institutions would want to hide the fact of that construction. </i><br>
<p>
Kathryn Aegis responds:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;a gender-bending individual, in revealing the constructed nature of </i><br>
<i>&gt;gender to others around them, will provoke enforcement reactions from </i><br>
<i>&gt;those fully conditioned into the norms and rules of any social </i><br>
<i>&gt;institution that intersects with the social institution of gender.  </i><br>
<p>
In the coming years, we will witness innovations in our current fields,<br>
social institutions and otherwise,  which are not only central to sex<br>
changes and gender differentiation, but also satellite disciplines.<br>
<p>
Today, in order to have a surgical sex change, an individual must have two<br>
favorable psychological tests.  This testing is comprised on one licensed<br>
psychiatrist and a certified psychologist or sex therapist or another<br>
psychiatrist. (The second such testing is the choice of the patient.)  The<br>
well-known "Harry Benjamin International Gender Criteria" test is used as a<br>
standard.<br>
<p>
Regardless of the lagging personal views of social structures, they will<br>
have to leap ahead because the cross-over of sex and genders isn't going to<br>
stop. It will only become even more complex.  Thus, new fields will develop<br>
and many of them will be sponsored, headed, financed and supported by the<br>
communities who need their expertise and good common sense.  The gay<br>
community has become quite recognized and powerful in many segments of<br>
society.  It is not longer considered a handicap, but a voice of individualism.<br>
<p>
Just as the gay community scientists, psychologists and innovative thinkers<br>
will soars ahead in designing regulations for aiding its own community, it<br>
will also become even more authenticated in making reasonable decisions<br>
about the perplexities of sex changes.  Also, the more we virtualize<br>
genders, the more switching over, and back and forth, emotionally and<br>
sexually, will become a party of culture.<br>
