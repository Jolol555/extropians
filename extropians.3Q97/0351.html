<i>&gt;requirement</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;that the PC ought to be operatable by even relatively stupid people. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;This last requirement is never quite fulfillable, of course, precisely</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;because it requires a bloated, complex program that is prone to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;occasional problem! :-)</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Another part of the bloating and stability problem is most of the major OS<br>
vendors try to make their product a "do-everything" OS.  I think the<br>
biggest failure on the part of the OS vendors is to try and make their OS<br>
like everyone else's.  What they should be doing is differentiating<br>
themselves by focusing more on their core competencies.<br>
<p>
Mac-based platforms are unsophisticated simple-to-use, single user systems<br>
that excel at realtime things like digital audio and video processing.<br>
This is their core technology and they do it well.  Yet they have been<br>
spending lots of money trying to market the concept that the MacOS is a<br>
great network machine and makes a great server, both of which are blatantly<br>
untrue.  The simplicity that is normally associated with the MacOS is due<br>
in part because many of the components that would make it a truly powerful<br>
OS never existed.  I suspect that re-designing the MacOS to include NT and<br>
UNIX-like technologies will do little to actually improve the market for<br>
MacOS, seeing as how that market is already filled.<br>
<p>
Windows NT is Microsoft's wannabe UNIX, but has neither the power nor<br>
flexibility of UNIX.  However, it is a great desktop OS and works great for<br>
peer-to-peer and workgroup networking.  What Microsoft *should've* done is<br>
lighten up NT by removing all the wannabe enterprise, Unix, and other<br>
generally useless components, and sold it as the ultimate business OS and<br>
forgotten about Windows 95.  NT is more stable than MacOS, fairly easy to<br>
use, far more powerful than MacOS in the networking department, but it is<br>
no substitute for the MacOS's core competencies.  NT is more stable than<br>
Win95 because it is a "from the ground up" OS and prefers stability to<br>
backward compatibility.<br>
<p>
Unix is irreplaceable as a server and network OS, and makes a pretty good<br>
research and development environment, but I seriously doubt its place as a<br>
user OS for numerous reasons (sorry Linux people!).  The learning curve is<br>
far too steep, and the interface is unintuitive and complex.  This is its<br>
power, but it is not for the masses.  With the exception of the Free Unix<br>
crowd, I don't think too many people had any illusions about this though.<br>
Can't beat the rock solid stability and (in most but not all cases) speed,<br>
though.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I've been using both Windows and Mac-Based platforms for years.  During </i><br>
<i>&gt;a 2 month period my company kept track of productivity comparisions </i><br>
<i>&gt;between the two platforms.  The results were devastating to the Wintel </i><br>
<i>&gt;Platform - every time a Mac crashed, the Wintel equivalent crashed 6 </i><br>
<i>&gt;times!</i><br>
<p>
I have a MacOS, NT, and Unix box at home and I use all 3 regularly.  Unix<br>
is by far the most stable.  I run Unix under heavy loads for months on end<br>
and it never crashes or even hiccups.  NT is definitely less stable than<br>
Unix, but crashes less often than the MacOS and is way faster than the<br>
MacOS system even though NT is running on significantly slower hardware.<br>
Windows 95 is simply too dirty an OS to be particularly stable.  I never<br>
use it on my own machines.  However, it is more stable than the old Win 3.1<br>
environment that I use to use in days of yore.<br>
<p>
"Productivity" is a slippery definition.  A software developer would find<br>
Unix, NT, and too a lesser extent Windows 95 to be more "productive" than<br>
MacOS.  The marketing department may beg to differ.  For many applications<br>
a command line interface is faster than a GUI, but may or may not be more<br>
productive depending on who you ask.  I have MacOS, NT, and Unix systems<br>
because I recognize the fact that some OSs are significantly more<br>
productive and efficient for certain tasks than others.  Instead of trying<br>
to fight the weakness of one system, I utilize the strengths of all of them.<br>
<p>
What would really be cool is an OS that could radically reconfigure and<br>
optimize itself on the fly to support multiple models... <br>
