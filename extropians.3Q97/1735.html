"Remote Licking Fyborgs"<br>
   - Today, we heard Sasha Chislenko elegantly abstract the functional<br>
system from its physical substrate. True freedom requires a life without<br>
boundaries, and Sasha played dextrously with those boundaries as freely as<br>
his charming 20Hz voice drifted through one's ears. If you haven't already<br>
read his masterly publications, read them now. Sasha went on to discuss the<br>
concept of remote licking, an extension of the virtual reality theme, to<br>
roars of enthusiasm, which mostly, I noted, came from females. He further<br>
demonstrated how we ourselves have become "fyborgs", most of our function<br>
residing outside our biological bodies.<br>
<p>
     Sasha warned the wary to be on the look-out for flying assassin<br>
automatons. The encryption of cellular telephone calls in the US was<br>
delayed by the legal system's attempt to prevent snooping. As Mark Miller<br>
reminded us, technology is so often superior to the law. Then Sasha<br>
announced that flying, navigating robots are easier to build than mobile<br>
ground-based ones. With the anonymity and strong security promised by Mark<br>
Miller, malicious agents might release automatons in the near future which<br>
could whizz around and shoot anyone they don't like. I always wanted to<br>
build a model aircraft, and now I have an incentive.<br>
<p>
<p>
"Anders' Mind Gets Bigger"<br>
   - Yesterday, we had seen evidence that Anders Sandberg uses his computer<br>
to help him think. He showed us that, whilst he was writing his notes for<br>
his presentation, his word processor was delivering up suggestions on what<br>
to write based upon a database of previous correspondence both to and from<br>
others. He feels that his material is improved by this process, and<br>
suddenly I wonder how I can ever compete with such a powerful recall system.<br>
<p>
     If Sasha can abstract the human thinking system from its physical<br>
substrate (and we hope that he can, for that is what mind uploading is all<br>
about), and if Anders uses his computer to help him think, does that not<br>
mean that Anders' thinking system extends beyond his physical being? Sasha<br>
might draw the boundary around Anders' thinking system to include his head,<br>
arms and computer. Has Anders' artificial computer contributed to his<br>
apparent intelligence, and thus become in a way, a part of that<br>
intelligence? And would Anders pass the Turing test? (Perhaps we should<br>
make him take it?)<br>
<p>
<p>
"AI Researchers Make No Progress (again)"<br>
   - The AI Panel was chaired by (we're not worthy) Prof. Marvin Minsky. I<br>
felt a sharp contrast between his vast experience on the one hand and the<br>
quick wits of Anders and Sasha on the other. The main thrust of the panel<br>
seemed to be: "We're not getting anywhere", so that contrast is perhaps<br>
encouraging. Prof. Minsky argued that the technological singularity will<br>
happen once a machine can design (and presumably build) a better machine<br>
with similar properties to itself faster than humans could do it, and<br>
although Dr. Robin Hanson disagreed, such a time can hardly be far off<br>
considering the power of modern CAE tools. Computers are already designed<br>
and built largely by computers faster than humans could do it on their own.<br>
Dr. Ralph Merkle proposed that we solve the problem with ...<br>
nanotechnology. I wasn't sure if it was serious or a joke, but Robert<br>
Bradbury informed us later that work was in progress to deliver a newspaper<br>
headline-class supercomputer around 2007 designed specifically to help<br>
Drexler and Merkle with their research. <br>
<p>
<p>
"On Your Bike"<br>
   - The "Investing in the Future" planel was, er, varied. I felt that<br>
Peter Voss had the best angle on it. If you're going to invest in the<br>
future, it might as well be your own, so start your own company. This suits<br>
me, more the entrepreneur than team player, but other more co-operatist<br>
Extropians might disagree.<br>
<p>
     Chris Peterson and her forsighted colleagues made an entertaining and<br>
lively presentation, widely enjoyed, covering environmental issues.<br>
<p>
     It was good that Robert Bradbury named names on who is actually doing<br>
the medical research now, and he made sure that we all know about life<br>
extension, the limits imposed by accidents, Jupiter Brains and the Fermi<br>
Paradox. His delivery was fast and effective.<br>
<p>
<p>
"Cryopreservation in 20 Years"<br>
   - The Prometheus Project is attempting to raise the necessary funds to<br>
conduct the proper research to perfect the techniques for placing a human<br>
in suspended animation AND bringing them out again. Once the project kicks<br>
off, founders hope that after twenty years, suspension will be an option<br>
available to all whose animation unexepectedly deserts them due to accident<br>
or disease. Paramedics, doctors and hospitals around the globe will all<br>
have the facility as standard. Somehow, I doubt that this can be achieved<br>
in a 20-year timetable, but the goal is surely honourable, and deserves our<br>
best wishes, not mention our money.<br>
<p>
<p>
An entertaining weekend. But now I really must go back to sleep. Time<br>
Zones. Who'd have them?<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
Darren<br>
