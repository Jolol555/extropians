To make a promise is to voluntarily restrict one's future actions. But <br>
there's nothing about making promises that violates one's own self-<br>
ownership. (Heck, one could even posit that a defining characteristic<br>
of self-ownership is the ability to make promises, because those who<br>
do not own themselves simply cannot make promises... they might be able<br>
to mouth them, but they cannot make them.)<br>

<i> &gt; extent of this contract, but I'm the only one that seems to think </i><br>
<i> &gt; that this is government any way you slice it.</i><br>
<p>
So have you gotten around to reading Friedman's The Machinery of Freedom,<br>
Benson's The Enterprise of Law, or Tom Morrow's essay presented at Extro-1<br>
(now available on the web) yet? The existence of these works is the primary<br>
reason why no one on the list has yet bothered to explain to you in <br>
intricate detail why they disagree with you about this.<br>
