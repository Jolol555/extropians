<p>
I think the progress on the hardware side has been great. However, if <br>
there wasn't continuous upgrading then Microsoft and Intel (Wintel) <br>
would go out of business.  Microsoft comes out with a new, more bloated <br>
version of their software, and Intel in turn has to come out with a new <br>
and faster chip for it to run on.  Have you ever noticed that it takes <br>
Windows 95 longer to load on a Pentium than Win 3.1 on a early version <br>
of the 486?  If you consider Windows 95 progress then you haven't really <br>
fathomed the potential software that could really be done on these <br>
supercomputer chips we now posses. Microsoft and Intel are in bed <br>
together to insure future business and market share. If you have not <br>
noticed this, then you must be kidding!<br>

government.<br>
<i>&gt;When people say 'corporate coercion' in the usual sense, it's just</i><br>
<i>&gt;another whine.</i><br>
<p>
I definitly have to disagree here.  Lets me diverge for a moment.  I <br>
consider myself an anarchist.  A "true" anarchy is where individuals can <br>
do anything they want as long as it dosen't interfere with anothers <br>
freedom.  If an individual or group of individuals grabs a bunch of arms <br>
and starts terrorizing the rest of the people in this "anarchy" into <br>
submission, then we no longer have "anarchy" but a new form of <br>
authoritarianism..  Now back to corporations... <br>
<p>
It's corporations that are increasingly requiring piss tests to get a <br>
job.  Imagine if you had to take a random piss test from the government <br>
just to stay in "good citizen" status and not be thrown in jail!  Please <br>
don't misunderstand me, I'm not defending government in any way.  What I <br>
am saying however, is that a corpocracy is not a free-market.  A good <br>
example was in the early part of this century when Rockefeller would <br>
open up a new gas stations next to small independent operators.  When <br>
one of his stations first opened they would charge less then wholsale <br>
prices until the other guy COULD NO LONGER COMPETE and go out of <br>
business.  As soon as the small-time operator went out of business, <br>
Rockefeller would raise the price of gas higher than the small-time guy <br>
was originally operating at.  If you consider this practice fair-game in <br>
a Free-Market economy, then I will have to take serious odds with the <br>
whole concept of a "Free-Market" as you are presenting it.<br>
