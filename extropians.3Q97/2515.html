You seem to have utterly missed my point.  A nanite invading an organism<br>
is a machine floating in an aqueous environment being glommed by<br>
antibodies as well as swallowed and exposed to highly oxidizing<br>
chemicals.  "It's easier to destroy than create."<br>
<p>
Actually, as I remember, the original gray goo scenario was of nanites<br>
spreading and gobbling whatever they could, starving the biosphere by<br>
grabbing all of the biomass.  That's where the concern about<br>
indigestability comes into play; bacteria may not be able to usefully<br>
eat nanites.  White blood cells don't have to eat nanites, they just<br>
have to destroy them.  I think pre-empting the biosphere is a somewhat<br>
more realistic threat than eating it directly.<br>
  <br>
} Yes, but even that would not save you long. You would run out of <br>
} resourses. The only way is to go out there and conquer the world <br>
<p>
Again, where did this sea of nanites come from?  Yeah, invading one<br>
would be bad, but how is the current world going to turn into isolated<br>
castles in a sea of goo?<br>
<p>

No, you need artillery.<br>

"I think it's amazing that 39 members of the Heaven's Gate cult thought<br>
they would beam up to space ships if they killed themselves.  Any<br>
reasonable person knows that in reality they will be reincarnated as<br>
animals.  You might not agree with my belief in reincarnation, but a lot<br>
of people do, so it's not a cult.  There's certainly no evidence that<br>
larger groups of people have ever believed anything stupid.  So once the<br>
number of believers exceeds a certain level, say 40, you have to think<br>
there's something to it.<br>
<p>
Unlike those "cultists" I wasn't brainwashed into my beliefs.  I simply<br>
had a huge painful void in my life that I filled with the first thing<br>
that came along.  You have to respect that. I'm not as gullible as those<br>
poor saps.  That's probably because I was born in June, which makes me<br>
a Gemini.  We're naturally skeptical." -- Scott Adams<br>
