<p>
This should test the many-worlds hypothesis vs the Copenhagen interpretation<br>
that it's a *concious* observer that collapses the wave function.  However,<br>
it does not test many-worlds against other theories in which someting other<br>
than a concious observer collapses the wave function.  In those cases whether<br>
the plate shows interference will depend on whether the quantum observer<br>
causes a wave function collapse.<br>
<p>
I'll throw in my own personal (and unsubstantiated) hypothesis for wave<br>
function collapse as an example.  I believe that wave function collapse<br>
occurs when the quantum wave function would create a paradox.  Some<br>
calculations for quantum behavior include considering particles travelling<br>
backwards in time (Hawking's black hole radiation).  With time travel,<br>
paradoxes are easy to cook up, so this is plausible to me.  As to why the<br>
wave function collapses in a particular way, I have no idea.<br>
<p>
Anyway, by this hypothesis, conciousness does not by definition require the<br>
ability to collapse wave functions.  Perhaps conciousness involves so much<br>
feedback that a conciousness cannot observe without collapsing a waveform.<br>
 In this case the quantum conciousness would not be able to perform the<br>
required action of observing and signing while remaining in superimposed<br>
states.  If it were capable, then after erasure the photon would remain<br>
un"observed" and you would indeed still see an interference pattern.  So in<br>
this case at least my hypothesis produces the same prediction as many-worlds.<br>
<p>
P.S. I'm sure somebody else has published on this hypothesis.  I seem unable<br>
to come up with genuinely new ideas, although I frequently develop the same<br>
ideas as other people without seeing their work.  Chalk it up to the theory<br>
that memes are formed mostly by the chance interaction of other memes rather<br>
than by directed search on the part of human minds.<br>
