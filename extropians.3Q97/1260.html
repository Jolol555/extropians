You're right.  Two and a half millenia ago, the Buddha's answers<br>
to these questions was to refrain from answering them, and to point<br>
out that they are profitless.  In a few more decades or centuries,<br>
though, they may become very practical questions indeed.  (At the<br>
moment, I still find myself trapped in a gravity well, which is<br>
perhaps the real reason why I found the AP a "good enough" answer<br>
to allow me to move on to other questions.)<br>
<p>
The problem is that whenever I try to think really hard about<br>
multiple universes devoid of life, whether or not they exist, and<br>
what to do about them, I always get distracted by thoughts of<br>
multiple celestial bodies, which certainly exist and are certainly<br>
devoid of life (some of them, anyway), and what to do about them.<br>
Also I read too much Hume and Nietzsche when I was young enough to<br>
be impressionable (gullible?) and so metaphysics makes me more<br>
nervous than other areas of philosophical inquiry do.  I tend to<br>
think of metaphysics as a scratchpad theoretical area of the brain<br>
where people keep their "overarching" paradigms.  Everyone has<br>
these, including me, and most of them are not worth much.  (I think<br>
all theories are fallible, but metaphyscial theories even more so<br>
than usual.)  The useful paradigms are usually more concrete, and<br>
have specific areas of applicability and inapplicability that we've<br>
learned to recognize.  Metaphysical paradigms are supposed to<br>
encompass everything; I don't know if ape brains are capable of<br>
hosting computational structures that can encompass everything.<br>
Perhaps they are, perhaps not: if the latter, then probably we<br>
can become something better than ape brains in a little while<br>
longer.<br>
<p>
What keeps metaphysics interesting to me is the fuzziness of its<br>
boundary with neighboring subjects.  In fact, Tipler and Barrow<br>
did a lot to make these sorts of questions more interesting to me<br>
just by yanking them out of the heart of metaphysics and dragging<br>
them over to the boundary area with mathematical cosmology.  Perhaps<br>
the real philosophers will shake their heads knowingly, but I just<br>
can't get into Nozick's and Heidegger's long rambles about why<br>
there is something rather than nothing.  I'm not really sure what<br>
the paying market is for such works.  Reading that sort of thing<br>
always leaves me feeling that I might just as well be counting a<br>
rosary or spinning a prayer wheel.<br>
