Hmm, for concretness, let's assue you are the size of a house. With <br>
nanotech, the time it takes to assemble sufficient TNT to blow a <br>
house to pieces would be much less than the time it would take to <br>
move the house.<br>
	Ok, so you put wheels on your house, or wings and a jet engine. But <br>
the aggressor could do the same; and at least today, small missiles <br>
can usually catch up with big warplanes. Or even better: He could <br>
build TNT all over the place to begin with, so you have nowhere to <br>
go.<br>
	Perhaps he can't build TNT all over the place, because there are <br>
other people living there, secluded within their own walls. We can <br>
call this the bee-hive scenario; there are still independent, <br>
humanoid beings, and each has her own cell, the cells being packed <br>
side by side in a three dimensional structure. The surface of hive <br>
is a heat emitter and energy collector... No, I need to think this <br>
through before I write about it. I might do a nanotech strategies <br>
paper when I have finished the ones I am working on now (one of which <br>
is on what a superintelligence could be expected to do etc.). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you know what defenses I have, then I'm vulnerable (think of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; AIDS virus, which uses the immune system), but if I have a system</i><br>
<i>&gt; which you know fairly little about, then it is harder to design a</i><br>
<i>&gt; workable attack (hint: never let your enemy get fingernail clippings</i><br>
<i>&gt; or spittle, he can use them to bring down black magic on you!). So it</i><br>
<i>&gt; might be a good idea to design *and* evolve your defenses to make</i><br>
<i>&gt; them unique. And a good basic structure would give you time to act</i><br>
<i>&gt; ("Oh shit! My immune nanites can't stop the infection. Let's call</i><br>
<i>&gt; tech support...").</i><br>
<p>
Why design *and* evolve? I mean, obviously they would evolve if we <br>
first design one version and then an improved version; but why would <br>
they evolve in the sense we were discussing, i.e. by sexual <br>
reproduction and natural selction? If there is an advantage in having <br>
a system that is unknown to your enemy, then change the design often, <br>
or include random elements. This avoids seriously maladaptive <br>
offspring, introduces the unknowability exactly where it matters, <br>
and is quicker. Besides, natural evolution would often be <br>
predictable by the enemy if he knows the fitness landscape.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; (2) What if new chemical reactions are introduced? Will complicated </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; higher organisms still be viable? Exactly what properties of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; system does this depend on? Does anybody have any idea of how to get </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a handle on this problem?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Very broadly, the question seems to be if diamondoid mechanosynthetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; or a aquaeous carbochemic biomass has the lowest chemical energy; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; biosphere would tunnel to the lowest if given a reaction pathway. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; guess diamond is the stablest, since cells cannot digest it, but it</i><br>
<i>&gt; might be too energy-intensive for nanites competing with each other</i><br>
<i>&gt; to digest too (thick diamondoid sediments on the ocean floors; in</i><br>
<i>&gt; time they will form a very fun form of "chalk"). </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think complicated organisms are still quite viable, since they have</i><br>
<i>&gt; the advantage of fast cultural evolution before biological evolution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It doesn't matter if their biology is about diamond or water.</i><br>
<p>
I would find it very interesting if you could expand a bit on this.<br>
