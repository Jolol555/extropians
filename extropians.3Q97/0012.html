No, usually it was economically imposed saturation of a market or a rise in<br>
costs due to diminishing returns to scale.  The mileage of canals in the<br>
U.S. grew exponentially from 1790 to 1836, the mileage of railways from 1830<br>
to 1890, the mileage of paved roads from 1900 to 1950.  After that the<br>
growth leveled off, and in the case of canals and railways mileage<br>
eventually began to decline.  I suppose according to your theory, if it<br>
weren't for those nasty reactionaries, Americans would enjoy billions of<br>
miles of canals and railroads.    <br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And if commercial supersonic flight were not illegal over continental</i><br>

<p>
It doesn't matter if it was, according to your standards, a "matter of<br>
technology" or not.  The point is that exponential growth does not continue<br>
indefinitely, and it often ends by running into unexpected barriers.  In<br>
1970, who would have thought noise, pollution, or a bunch of Arab<br>
politicians could hve stopped the mighty juggernaut of American aerospace<br>
progess?  In fact, political forces tried to continue the exponential curve<br>
past the point of feasibility, producing the money-losing Concorde.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In fact, if you count our</i><br>
<i>&gt;autonomous spaceflight technology, </i><br>
<p>
I don't.  I chose my words advisedly: commercial air transport.  I would<br>
include commercial manned space transport, if there were any such thing.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The maximum speed of a Pentium might be 500 MHz for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; decades, until someone develops a breakthrough technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sure there may by a maximum speed for that particular computer</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology, but there is no reason other technologies will not surpass</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Pentium chip as it becomes outmoded by economics. </i><br>
<p>
Well, as long as we're arguing on the basis of "no reason why not": there is<br>
also no reason why those new technologies should not appear either faster or<br>
slower than Mooore's law suggests.  <br>
<p>
The recent exponential increase in the cost of fabs to build each generation<br>
of chips is an alarming sign.  Each generation costs twice as much capital<br>
as the one before, and it is only the matching exponential growth in sales<br>
that has kept the price per unit manufactured down.  If this continues, in<br>
three generations, the cost of a single fab will exceed the quantity of<br>
capital that can be feasibly assembled into a single commercial venture<br>
(about 10 billion dollars).  That's why I picked 500 MHz: it's two fab<br>
generations in the future.  It will be perfectly feasible to build faster<br>
chips than that, and Intel probably will.  It just won't be feasible to<br>
build them at a profit.  A 1000 MHz  Pentium can't cost more than three<br>
times a 500 MHz Pentium, or nobody will buy it, because it will be cheaper<br>
to use a multiprocessor machine.<br>
<p>
If this happens, I suspect the PowerPC or other RISC chip will eventually<br>
become the microprocessor of choice, because, given a fixed fab technology,<br>
RISC chips are about 50% faster than Pentiums, ande in the absence of rapid<br>
growth, siwtching will make sense.  So in 2001, when the financing for<br>
Intel's $12 billion new fab falls apart, my advice is, buy IBM and Motorola.<br>
