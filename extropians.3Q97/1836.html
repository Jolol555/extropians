     A little blurb in the SF Chronicle about what movie project Val Kilmer <br>
      should do next and one of the considerations was a futuristic <br>
     "thriller" pitting us against computers and technology.  More <br>
     Terminator-style Armageddon crap.  We get too big for our britches and <br>
     whoops....rrrrrrip!<br>
     <br>
     The movie is titled "Matrix" and is being done by Warner Brothers.  It <br>
     troubles me that the sensationalism in films more often than not leans <br>
     towards the constructive and rational rather than the fear-inducing <br>
     impact they choose, ostensibly for the dramatic effect.  <br>
     <br>
     I say this with such personal emphasis because my dear boss was the <br>
     first fatality of the Unibomber.  All because he happened to be a high <br>
     tech provider in a tiny strip mall that already had a Computerland and <br>
     a Software Centre.  I had the unpleasant role of seeing this tragedy <br>
     from a front row seat...so anything that promotes violence and <br>
     particularly in conjunction with advanced technology just leads me to <br>
     conclude that such fodder is providing grist for the mill of budding <br>
     whackos out there.<br>
     <br>
     This only makes me feel like I want to get to work sooner on the <br>
     Singularity screenplay.<br>
     <br>
