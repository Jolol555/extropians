It's not so "metaphorical" in languages that are low on the<br>
Berlin-Kay scale.  What the heck does he mean by that, I hear<br>
you ask.  To be brief, there are plenty of languages that have<br>
only a few color terms; e.g. in Swahili the only true adjectives<br>
for color[*] are translated as `black' `white' `red' -- but their<br>
older meaning is more likely `dark' `pale' `warm-color'.  In such<br>
color-poor languages, I *am* white, because `white' embraces a chunk<br>
of color-space much bigger than the 1/16 or less that we give it.  On<br>
another hand, by that standard a lot of "yellow" people are white too.<br>
<p>
[*] Swahili has other color terms, but they're periphrastic:<br>
`green' = `of the color of leaves', `gray' = `of the color of ash',<br>
`blue' = `of the color of _buluu_'.  Presumably these are newer<br>
than the three adjectives.  (For all I know, colloquial Swahili<br>
has true adjectives that didn't make it into my books.)<br>
