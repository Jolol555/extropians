<p>
Sorry, step 2A doesn't occur that easily. GAs tend to produce<br>
bloated, redundant and weird code; their strength is that they are so<br>
good at finding flexible solutions. <br>
<p>
The basic idea above is sound, Thomas Ray has suggested something like this<br>
to get completely unexpected solutions to problems nobody has yet posed. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is this assumption I want to challenge. If it has the tremendous</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; destructive potential you assume, it is a fairly logical assumption.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But can you really back it up with some hard calculations?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How much time would it take for a nanomachine to construct a nuclear weapon? </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think we can assume that nano is at least as destructive as nuke.</i><br>
<p>
Numbers, please. It is easy to claim something like this, but is it<br>
really true? <br>
<p>
Building a nuke: you need around 10 kilograms of uranium 235 (or whatever<br>
isotope it was). There is around 2 grams uranium / tonne in the crust of the <br>
earth, of which 0.72% is U235, so to get 10 kg you need to process around <br>
7000 tonnes of crust. I'm not sure how much energy is required to reduce<br>
the UO2 to pure U, but it is a noticeable amount (are there a chemist<br>
in the house?). Assuming the nanites cover a large patch with solar<br>
collectors, they can get around 500 W/m^2, which has to cover their<br>
replication, search through the crust, reduction, isotope separation and return<br>
to the "base"; how much energy this is is a bit hard to tell right now <br>
(it is 1.30 in the morning here :-), but it looks like it will take<br>
a while for the bomb-mold to blow up. A wild guess would be around a <br>
week. <br>
<p>
Doing the same work as a nuke with nanites (i.e. disassembling everything<br>
within a few hundred meters and blasting everything within a few kilometers)<br>
is rather tricky, since it is extremely energy intensive. You need plenty<br>
of energy to do the disassembly (essentially you have to break most molecular<br>
bonds), and nanites are bad at making blast waves. OK, this is an unfair<br>
comparision since nanites are more similar to bacterial or viral infections.<br>
<p>
I would like to do some more careful calculations on this (or rather, that<br>
somebody with the right knowledge did it instead of a bumbling amateur like<br>
me), but it is IMHO clear that we should not be overly worried about<br>
nano-built nuclear weapons but rather nano-ebola. Everything in the world<br>
has limits set by the laws of nature. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Remember that the Bad Guys aren't operating under the same restrictions as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Good Guys.  The wannabe dictators will use directed evolution on a scale no</i><br>
<i>&gt; Good Guy would dare to contemplate.  And evolving mutually competing predators</i><br>
<i>&gt; will go a lot faster than mutually supporting immune systems.</i><br>
<p>
Ever thought about the fact that the immune system isn't mutually supporting?<br>
It is rather a balance of predators which do not predate on each other since<br>
that destroys their fitness. <br>
<p>
Good guys will be motivated to contemplate directed evolution since the bad guys<br>
do it; and they tend to have more brainpower and money on their side. I<br>
think the weapon of openness is important here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Our immune systems are unimaginably more sophisticated than a virus or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bacterium, using controlled evolution to combat natural evolution.  And yet we</i><br>
<i>&gt; still suffer from colds and diseases.  The only reason that the viruses</i><br>
<i>&gt; haven't killed us outright is that it isn't good strategy.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly. So the major question is: is it possible to create a nanite<br>
infection that is deadly (or subtle) enough to wipe out all competition?<br>
Don't reflexively answer 'yes' to it, try to give a considered answer<br>
of why it is likely (or why not). Note that it would have to be able<br>
to spread across the world fast enough to subvert everyone, or circumvent<br>
all attempts at detection. That is assuming a lot. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I want to repeat this, because it's important.  Our immune systems are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; closest analogue to proposed nano-immunities.  The mismatch in available power</i><br>
<i>&gt; and sophistication is enormous.  Our immune systems learn from experience, use</i><br>
<i>&gt; controlled and directed evolution, have memories... everything but the ability</i><br>
<i>&gt; to consciously design things.  And yet the viruses waltz casually through our</i><br>
<i>&gt; bodies, because it's so much easier to destroy than create.</i><br>
<p>
Have you studied medicine? Then you know viruses certainly do not waltz causally<br>
through your body (of which around *one kilogram* apparently is immune cells, if <br>
you are a normally built male).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is easier to destroy than create!</i><br>
<p>
You repeat this as a mantra. And of course you have the second law of<br>
thermodynamics on your side. The problem is that you do not attempt to<br>
make quantitative comparisions between the strengths of different systems,<br>
and instead rely on plausible-sounding arguments. That is definitely<br>
*not* a good strategy if you are trying to discuss something important<br>
where we do need a well planned policy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If any human is even capable of designing an immune system,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then the average educated person will be capable of breaking it, given time</i><br>
<i>&gt; and effort.  Any twisted genius will go through it like tissue paper.</i><br>
<p>
Sigh, here we go again. What is your evidence for this? A few months ago<br>
somebody on sci.nanotech posted a challenge for people to come up with<br>
nanotech immune systems and he would find flaws in them. I don't think<br>
there was any follow-up, which is sad, but it might be worth taking up<br>
here on the list. Unfortunately I do lack the time to deal with this<br>
as carefully I would like, since I consider this very important, but <br>
let's try a simple sketch to see how easy it is to vanquish a designed<br>
immune system:<br>
<p>
The body is surrounded by an inert skin (say diamond); attempts to<br>
physically breach it can be detected from the inside and the surrounding<br>
region sealed. The rest of the organism (could be a transhuman, factory<br>
or a city) is compartmentalized with similar walls; infected sections<br>
can be isolated. Immune devices move around, interrogating "cells"<br>
(subsystems) by comparing their surface markings with allowed types<br>
(this list can be kept secret from someone who disassembles a device<br>
by using a trapdoor function), and occasionally disassembling the <br>
cell to check its innards. Other immune devices check the general<br>
activity, looking for deviations from the normal state (there is<br>
a paper on the net somewhere about using GAs to evolve anti-hacking<br>
agents, this is something similar). If a compartment is found to be<br>
infected it is terminated with extreme prejudice (the human body<br>
uses the granulocytes and their nasty cocktail of free radicals,<br>
chlorine acids and proteolytic enzymes, this would use something<br>
worse or simply throw out the infected compartment from the <br>
organism). Note that production of new immune devices can be done<br>
by assemblers in well defended deep regions, and that the <br>
devices themselves can be fairly simple since they do not need<br>
to replicate, just find threats. <br>
<p>
So, what are the obvious holes? <br>
