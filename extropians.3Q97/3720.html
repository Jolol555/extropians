<p>
Eliezer? Why are you so intent on doing everything on your own? What is it<br>
that you hate in teamwork? Even if you are smarter than 99.9998% of the<br>
global population there will always be things you can learn from others,<br>
like 20th-century history (no offence intended) or seeing suffering without<br>
ceasing to function rationaly. Or milking a cow, give a hand in he birth of<br>
a baby or a million other worthwhile experiences you cannot even imagine at<br>
this point.<br>
<p>
Besides that it could be *fun*. Have fun Eliezer, you could have a stroke<br>
in 14 seconds (just like anybody) and then you'll be gone for at least some<br>
time (you an Alcor member?). I'd be a shame if you missed out on the simple<br>
joys of life.<br>
<p>
Still with us? Good. Some final thoughts about all the bad words in the<br>
subject lines, after this, I think I'm done.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;If people knew what was going on, if they could see videos of children being</i><br>
<i> &gt;cut in half by gunfire instead of reading about "ethnic strife", there would</i><br>
<i> &gt;be enough popular support to send in enough troops to solve the problem.</i><br>
<p>
Images from Yugoslavian concentation camps were shown daily on global TV<br>
for several years before something was done. It's easy to have the opinion<br>
that 'this is a bad thing'. Actually going there and risk getting your head<br>
blown off is something else. We in the west have so much to lose by early<br>
death that we don't go to war very quickly, even if we should.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Unfortunately, our taboo against genocide, and our taboos against violence,</i><br>
<i> &gt;prevent newspapers from printing such pictures, and prevent TVs from showing</i><br>
<i> &gt;such films.</i><br>
<p>
I don't see much US-tv but in Europe you could see people get shot on the 6<br>
'o' clock news, bits flying off and everything. Didn't make much difference<br>
sadly enough.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;So collect all the documentation you can find into a Web site,</i><br>
<i> &gt;www.genocides.org.</i><br>
 //snip//<br>
<i> &gt;Considering the technological leverage of our times, one wealthy donor would</i><br>
<i> &gt;probably be enough to finance the entire thing.</i><br>
<p>
You seem unaware that only about 1 or at the most 2 percent of the global<br>
population has acces to the web, most have never touched a phone.<br>
I do not believe it's a matter of being informed, the west lacks guts and<br>
resolve (worst in Europe).<br>
Again: E-mailing your representative is easy, you could even 'vote' for it.<br>
But somebody has to *want* to go there and do the job (I do no think it's<br>
neccesary for me to explain to an American what happens when you send<br>
people to fight a war they do not truly believe needs fighting).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Just because the newspapers refuse to print it, and the TVs won't show</i><br>
it, and<br>
<i> &gt;the politicians won't talk about it, is no reason we shouldn't know about</i><br>
it.<br>
<p>
Most people don't want to know it, it makes them feel quilty (this does<br>
show however that there is hope).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;If the modern genocides are as bad as the Holocaust, show! Don't tell!</i><br>
<p>
Modern genocides are, and should, in my view be stopped in the same manner<br>
that the holocaust was stopped: kill the perpetrators. Send a very clear<br>
message to anyone with mass-murdering ambitions: "Its still possible to<br>
commit genocide on this planet, we're working on that. It is however not<br>
possible to survive doing so for any length of time."<br>
<p>
Of course this would mean either the US army having a lot of work or<br>
expanding the UN, both options won't find much popularity on this list, I<br>
know.<br>
But untill we have nanotech-for-all and become so wealthy that 'we ain't<br>
gonna study war no more' I see no other solution. Doing nothing I find<br>
unacceptable.<br>
<p>
I did go, and I would do it again (I hope). Otherwise my opinion would be<br>
totally immoral. I remain hopefull, with some effort...<br>
