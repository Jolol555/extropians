     But, If we broad our minds, I really do not see any<br>
     reason why, for example, a man cannot have more than one wife (if he<br>
     earns enough ... and they too - it is important...), loving<br>
     themselves and all being happy and... a real family.<br>

     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     With all due respect, I'm assuming your first language isn't English. <br>
     English is my only language so if you working with two, you're ahead <br>
     of the game.  But try rinsing out your posts with a spell checker.  <br>
     The enormous number of misspellings is rather disorienting to those of <br>
     us who value the crafting of words.<br>
     <br>
     Now, onto the subject of polygamy:  How broad is a mind that refers to <br>
     the two sexes as "man" and "wife"?  You've objectified the sex <br>
     assigned to "wife" (presumably female).  How broad is the mind that <br>
     notes that "he" has to earn enough to justify more than one wife?  And <br>
     the notion of family is a cultural invention.  <br>
     <br>
     Your notions give me the impression of something more like opportunism <br>
     to be able to have sex at any given chance than to achieve a sense of <br>
     communal happiness by transcending traditional mores.<br>
     <br>
     I'm also interpolating in your whimsical thoughts on heaven having a <br>
     homosexual spin to it.  Most Judeo-Christian teachings instruct that <br>
     humans transcend sexual desire when they get to "heaven".  That's <br>
     A-sexual not gay-sexual.  &lt;G&gt;<br>
     <br>
     It is my opinion that the seed justifications for most religions <br>
     putting restrictions on sexual behavior is because of our rather <br>
     primitive tendency towards possession, objectifying humans rather than <br>
     regarding them as other conscious entities.  "Possessing" humans in a <br>
     marriage or family may have a better spin to it than more blatant <br>
     forms of slavery.  The difference is that each entity gets a role in <br>
     the decision making.  Women and children have been usurped in the <br>
     patriarchal motif that pervades western culture.  <br>
     <br>
     A true polygamous situation would not only enable the "man" to have <br>
     wives, but the wives to have wives, the man to have men.  Then there's <br>
     the matter of how children are factored in to the sexual <br>
     interrelations.  Some may draw the line at children (as would I out of <br>
     cultural deference and personal preference) but fact of the matter is, <br>
     we place up boundaries regarding the impropriety of sexual relations <br>
     with children because of the manipulative and objectifying ways in <br>
     which we practice such behavior.  <br>
     <br>
     For male-female combinations, it is not genetically in our best <br>
     interest to inbreed.  From such bad biological mixing could spring the <br>
     social taboo.  The same could even be said for men and boys in a world <br>
     where the population needed regular fortification.  It doesn't keep <br>
     the species up if men are not putting that semen to good use! &lt;G&gt; <br>
     Modern Western culture has no such issue and instinctual drives <br>
     towards a heterosexual orientation would not sufficiently impair a boy <br>
     exposed to same sex relations to necessarily retain that "preference" <br>
     unless you factor in mental and emotional issues (again, back to <br>
     objectification and disregard for the self-aware creature that could <br>
     create a dysfunction in the perception of self).<br>
     <br>
     Polygamy is a male-dominant and opportunistic mindset.  The true <br>
     freedom lies in putting away the notions of human possession.  As <br>
     benevolent a relationship as we might have, the stirrings of jealousy <br>
     and covetousness have very limbic and survivalist roots.  This may be <br>
     why early religions sought to lock it down and put hefty penalties on <br>
     not being restrained.  As we move towards an evolved sense of self, <br>
     having a sexual relationship, however brief, should carry no more <br>
     stigma than having a fast food lunch with a co-worker or having an <br>
     elegant dinner with friends.  <br>
     <br>
     Ah, food and sex.  Next to breathing and imagining, they are pretty <br>
     high up on the "don't forget to..." list.<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
