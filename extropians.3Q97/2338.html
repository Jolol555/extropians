Eric Watt Forste<br>
<i>&gt; UN committed genocide against the Bosnian Muslims by enforcing an</i><br>
<i>&gt; arms embargo against Yugoslavia at a time when most of the organized</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yugoslavian armed forces, and almost all of their materiel, was in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Serbian hands. You credit them with stopping, three years later,</i><br>
<i>&gt; a bloodbath that they (inadvertently?) laid the groundwork for.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Aided and abetted by the United States, of course.</i><br>
<p>
The UN intervention was delayed too long. But for all I know, if it <br>
hadn't intervened at all, the killing might still have gone on today, <br>
or one of the combatants might have won and done terrible <br>
things to the defeated people.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A green plague of ten different high-latency fatal strains of</i><br>
<i>&gt; virus will be quite useful to small potatoes terrorists. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't think the size of the potatoes is at issue here.  Small</i><br>
<i>&gt; potatoes can be quite deadly, especially nowadays.</i><br>
<p>
I agree. Still, the bigger the powers that fight, the sooner they <br>
will start to have access to weapons of mass destruction. So even if <br>
we can't eliminate all the small conflicts as well, we might be able <br>
to delay the use of, say, destructive nanoreplicators untill adequate <br>
defences have been developed. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; UN itself would not need to be impartial (though it would presumably</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; be much less partial that the parts that are fighting), it would</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; only need to implement the decisions of some independent tribunal.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I still don't understand why you think that "world government"</i><br>
<i>&gt; or transferring more power from the current nations to the UN</i><br>
<i>&gt; would increase the likelihood that large civil disputes would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be settled by the decisions of an independent tribunal. If the</i><br>
<i>&gt; disputants don't accept the decisions of the tribunal (and they</i><br>
<i>&gt; often don't) what is the difference from the current situation?</i><br>
<p>
The difference is that UN would be there to enforce the decision, <br>
whether the disputants accepted it or not. If somebody issues a <br>
"resolution", Sadam Hussein would wipe his ass with it; but a cruise <br>
missile is something that needs to be taken into account.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Military troubles are worst in the poorest nations. Allocating</i><br>
<i>&gt; political power by GNP will do almost nothing to soothe these</i><br>
<i>&gt; troubles. Better to keep poor countries and rich countries politically</i><br>
<i>&gt; decoupled from one another. What you are proposing is to arrange</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the rich countries to rule the poor countries (that's what your</i><br>
<i>&gt; "representation according to 'real' power seems to come down to),</i><br>
<i>&gt; which I guarantee will lead to war. It's been tried already.</i><br>
<p>
A clarification of my earlier statement: I only said that it might be <br>
advisable (I am not really certain of this) that a nation's <br>
representation in the UN is "in some proportion" to its real power. <br>
This would mean that real power would be taken into account, but <br>
other factors, such as population size or the extent to which a <br>
nation would be affected by UN decisions would also be given a role. <br>
The overall result would almost certainly be that poor nations were <br>
given somewhat *more* influence than they have in the real world <br>
today.<br>
<p>
Hey, let's take a step back and look at it this way. You have your <br>
own values, involving, perhaps, personal freedom, immortality, to see <br>
the ones you care for prosper etc. Surely you won't accept that <br>
some fucked up religious extremist lay these values in ashes by <br>
releasing some self-replicators, or that the inhabitants of your <br>
city are gassed as a result of a failed blackmail attempt by a wicked <br>
dictator. Yet these things will happen unless they are actively <br>
prevented. One way one might try to prevent them is by having a <br>
global organization with legislative powers that surveils the use of <br>
the most dangerous technologies and prevents irresponsible agents <br>
from acquiring them. The only enteties in the real world even <br>
remotely resembling this are the UN and a US led coalision.  In my <br>
original post I asked if someone had a better proposal, and I hope <br>
that someone has, but so far I have seen none.<br>
