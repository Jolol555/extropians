<i>&gt;   In my plans for immortality, I am trying to assess the viablilty of brain</i><br>
<i>&gt; transplantation. </i><br>
<p>
My guess is that to make brain transplantation safe enough to be considered<br>
would require technology so advanced that other forms of life extension<br>
might be viable. But cutting off heads and keeping them alive sounds<br>
reasonable (!).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   All a brain really needs to keep functioning is a good blood supply?</i><br>
<p>
I would claim it needs constant input to remain viable. Sensory deprivation<br>
is rather destabilizing, and without any signals from the outside the<br>
sensory nerves and cortex will start to atrophy. After 50 years, there<br>
would not be much left of you. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   OK, so assuming the the medical technique is practical, what will it take to</i><br>
<i>&gt; get my son to agree to the surgery?  We would be family, but a monetary</i><br>
<i>&gt; incentive might be necessary.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe you could found a religion and convince him that keeping daddys head<br>
alive was ordained by God?  ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Screw ethics when its my longevity at stake.</i><br>
<p>
I understand how you feel, but you better take the reactions of other <br>
people into account. They can be more helpful or dangerous than anything<br>
else.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Anybody know of any good cloning labs?</i><br>
<p>
You don't need much technology to do cloning, just an ordinary IVF<br>
lab with some expertise in cell culturing. <br>
