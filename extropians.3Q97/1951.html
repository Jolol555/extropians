One of the highlights of my trip to Extro 3 was the discovery that Forrest<br>
Bishop has also given serious thought to blowing up the Sun.  He's come up<br>
with a totally different method.  We had a wonderful conversation about<br>
that, and related topics.  There can't be many people who have considered<br>
how to blow up the Sun, but two of them were at Extro-3.  For two days, the<br>
Doubletree San Jose was the world's leading center for Solar detonation<br>
research.<br>
