I would recommend that everybody buy common stock, but like everything in the <br>
human world there are no guarantees. Personally I'm doing pretty well <br>
financially at the moment, I hope this happy state of affairs continues but <br>
unfortunately it is not a law of physics that it must. Even in today's slow<br>
moving world it takes greater than average intelligence to be a good money <br>
manager and it's not unknown for smart people to louse great fortunes,  <br>
imagine what things will be like near Damien's Spike when everything is <br>
changing at light speed. What seemed like, and indeed was, a great idea <br>
15 minutes ago now stands about as much chance of making money as a <br>
tattoo parlor in the Vatican.              <br>
