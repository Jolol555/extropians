<i>&gt;Now suddenly a bunch of people I don't recall seeing on the list before</i><br>
<i>&gt;are discussing it (half of whom seem like the original poster using</i><br>
<i>&gt;psuedonyms, if you ask me).  Did someone really invite people to join</i><br>
<i>&gt;extropians in order to have a place to talk about this?  How about asking</i><br>
<i>&gt;the people here if they minded first?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I've been an extropian (at least in spirit) since I read<br>
some of the early issues of Extropy magazine in 1990.<br>
<p>
Recently I subscribed to this list and also joined the<br>
Extropy Institute (online from the website) as a member?<br>
<p>
In addition to the reasons I've already stated for having<br>
this debate on the Extropy list, I offer two more:<br>
<p>
1. Max More's article "Deep Anarchy" starts as follows:<br>
<p>
"Two of the fundamental extropian values are responsibility for one's own<br>
life and actions, and the determination to do away with constraints on<br>
one's rational will.(1)  I believe that the institutions of religion and<br>
"the State"(2) are antithetical to these values."<br>
<p>
I believe NSPIC addresses the factors that keep the two institutions<br>
mentioned in place, and that there's a significant potential for the<br>
debate to result in individuals increasing their effectiveness in<br>
taking steps to increase their personal power and reduce the power<br>
of the two said institutions.<br>

Although it may not yet seem evident, "radically libertarian psychology"<br>
issues are strongly related to NSPIC and are bound to come up during the<br>
debate.<br>
<p>
I've invited quite a few strongly fredom-oriented people to explore<br>
the Extropy website -- partially with the hope that they would become<br>
interested in the Extropian philosophy -- and to subscribe to the list<br>
if they wanted to participate in the debate.  I've no idea how many<br>
new subscribers have joined as a result.<br>
<p>
I assumed -- naively perhaps -- that there was no need to ask for<br>
permission.<br>
