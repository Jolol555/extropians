<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;One problem I have with Anthropic Principle reasoning is the claim</i><br>
<i>&gt;that atoms and molecules much as we know them are necessary for life.</i><br>
<p>
Me too.  Max Tegmark's version in particular had me wondering why, e.g.,<br>
the game of Life isn't simpler (lower on his chart) than some unification<br>
of General Relativity and QM.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[...]Maybe they will have to fall into a narrow range, but there</i><br>
<i>&gt;will be *some* variability possible.  So all the AP can really do is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;reduce the magnitude of the problem.  The essential mystery will remain:</i><br>
<i>&gt;are there infinite universes, most of which have no life?  Is there just</i><br>
<i>&gt;one, and somehow it was created in the preferred state where life can</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolve?  I think there is a substantial issue here even accepting the AP.</i><br>
<p>
Tegmark says his version is testable: we can see whether we're close to<br>
the *simplest possible* life-sustaining set of rules.  If so, why?<br>
Tegmark's TOE says it's just statistically likely if all worlds are real.<br>
If we find ourselves close to the simplest livable world, and Tegmark's<br>
TOE predicted that, then isn't any other explanation of why we see what<br>
we see (for instance, saying that this world is the only "real" one)<br>
more complex than Tegmark's?  "Adding information" in his words?<br>
