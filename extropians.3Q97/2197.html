<i>&gt;      Contact is the only film I've seen more than once this summer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Looking forward to seeing some other "blockbusters" for their mindless</i><br>
<i>&gt;      entertainment value, I chose instead to see Contact again...and again</i><br>
<i>&gt;      (just three times, I'm not nuts! &lt;G&gt;).  Anyway, not knowing anything</i><br>
<i>&gt;      about the math or the astronomical accuracy (and personally not</i><br>
<i>&gt;      caring), I still find the statement, regardless of its lack of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      precision, awesome as merely a metaphor.  For what it's worth, I like</i><br>
<i>&gt;      to think it opened up, a little further, the minds of a few people who</i><br>
<i>&gt;      viewed it.  To use the basis of empirical truth against intuitive</i><br>
<i>&gt;      faith was an ideal foundation for this film.  I don't know if it was</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Sagan or Zemeckis or both who crafted the mentality of a child who,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      having lost both parents, looks to the heavens for purpose and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      meaning.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      I remember thinking when she gave that line that "millions" was much</i><br>
<i>&gt;      more than necessary for our purposes.</i><br>

I'm now readoing the book. The quote is similar in tone to<br>
something Ellie says in the book, but in the book, Sagan uses<br>
numbers that do make sense.<br>
<p>
In the Book, Ellie's childhood is much more complex (Father<br>
dies, Mother remarries, becomes weak and ineffectual, stepfather<br>
is a male chauvinist non-supportive asshole professor) but the<br>
movie captures the tone of the book beautifully, a free translation<br>
to a new medium rather than an awkward transliteration. The biggest<br>
difficulty with reading the book so far is that, being written in 1985,<br>
the Soviet Union is assumed to still be here. It's a bit jarring.<br>
