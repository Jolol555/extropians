<i>&gt;The Effective Optimist</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Angry faces filled the meeting room in my Oxford college. A student</i><br>
presented to the meeting yet another proposal for a protest. Righteous<br>
wrath amplified her voice as she spoke of a letter condemning corporations<br>
investing in South Africa. During the 1970s, the protests had been against<br>
nuclear weapons, nuclear power, and pollution. During the mid-80s, while I<br>
studied at Britain's Oxford University, the protesters complained about<br>
apartheid, hunger, poverty, and the Conservative government of Margaret<br>
Thatcher. Surrounded by gloomy, pessimistic protestors, I realized that the<br>
object of the protest was not the important thing. What mattered was simply<br>
to protest, to be against something or someone. These often<br>
well-intentioned people had adopted protest as an approach to life.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Many of us discover that we can feel virtuous by opposing whatever the</i><br>
trend-setters declare to be wrong. The protest mentality worms its way not<br>
only into social issues but into our basic approach to thinking, feeling,<br>
and behaving. Throughout my student years I found myself surrounded by<br>
people focused on complaining about problems. Rarely did I see a focus on<br>
solutions and possibilities. Destructive criticism feels easier than<br>
constructive thinking. In that environment, my optimistic attitude stuck<br>
out like an African at a Klu Klux Klan convention. Despite the external<br>
pressures I maintained an optimistic outlook. I also came to appreciate the<br>
dangers lurking in optimism. We do ourselves and others no favors if we<br>
replace a pessimistic protest mentality with a passive optimism that<br>
assures that us all will work out well without personal effort. I<br>
formulated the idea of Dynamic Optimism to integrate the motivating,<br>
uplifting effects of optimism with an active, responsible approach to=<br>
 living.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Optimism forms a core part of living extropically. If we wish to live</i><br>
effectively we will have to root out self-defeating pessimism, replacing it<br>
with a rational, active form of optimism. Becoming an effective optimist<br>
requires more of us than putting on a forced smile and telling ourselves<br>
"everything will work out for the best". Living at full capacity asks us to<br>
go beyond superficial formulas ("Don't Worry, Be Happy!") and to understand<br>
an intelligent form of optimism. We will only expand the vitality and<br>
achievement in our lives if we understand what optimism is, why pessimism<br>
holds us back, and why some kinds of optimism restrain us rather than<br>
shooting us forward.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Those of us who think of ourselves as rational, clear-headed people, may</i><br>
say "I'm neither an optimist nor a pessimist. I'm a realist." In making<br>
such a reasonable-sounding statement we would intend to express an<br>
commitment to truth, sound judgment, and rationality. I suggest that we can<br>
be both optimists and realists at the same time. The nature of the world<br>
means that to be realistic we must normally be optimistic. Optimism and<br>
pessimism are more than attitudes toward truth. In saying I am an optimist,<br>
I am saying more than that I expect life to get better. That is a purely<br>
factual belief. It is either right or wrong. Optimists go beyond holding<br>
certain beliefs about the future. They also display certain attitudes.<br>
Optimism and pessimism involve not detached estimates of the objective<br>
probability of good and bad events in the future, but personal commitments<br>
to certain modes of thinking and behaving. By mastering these modes of<br>
thinking and adopting optimistic attitudes, we can profoundly influence our<br>
thinking, behavior, happiness, and achievement. Dynamic Optimism contains<br>
too many aspects to fully capture in a single sentence, yet a definition<br>
will focus us on the essentials:<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;DYNAMIC OPTIMISM is an active, empowering, constructive attitude that</i><br>
creates conditions for success by focusing and acting on possibilities and<br>
opportunities.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To understand Dynamic Optimism deeply and to apply it to expanding our</i><br>
lives, we need to become aware of its diverse aspects-the personal<br>
characteristics of a dynamic optimist and the kinds of powerful thinking<br>
patterns such a person displays. The dynamic optimist both interprets<br>
experience positively, and influences outcomes positively. Merely believing<br>
that everything will work out fine without taking action makes one a<br>
foolish optimist, not a dynamic optimist. For optimism to give us the power<br>
to overcome the limits in our lives it needs to fully recognize reality,<br>
not hide from it. For optimism to maximize our abilities and happiness, we<br>
have to take responsibility for our thoughts, our attitudes, and our<br>
actions. This world is full of possibility. We can achieve almost anything<br>
we can conceive. Yet we will move forward only by turning dreams into<br>
practical, rational, responsible thinking. This kind of thinking will<br>
naturally generate productive activity.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The twelve key characteristics of the dynamic optimist can be stated</i><br>
briefly but take practice and wisdom to implement consistently. First I<br>
will divide them into characteristics involving the positive interpretation<br>
of experience and the positive influencing of outcomes. We can then<br>
investigate in more detail what each involves.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;INTERPRETING EXPERIENCE POSITIVELY:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(1) Selective Focus: Emphasizing the enjoyable, constructive, open aspects</i><br>
of life.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(2) Refraining from Complaining: Avoiding pointless complaining and</i><br>
whining about one's difficulties. Taking the world as it is and not<br>
complaining that life isn't fair.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(3) Questioning Limits: A constructive skepticism that challenges the</i><br>
limiting beliefs held by ourselves, our associates, and our society. A<br>
fundamental creative openness to possibilities.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(4) Sense of Abundance: Feeling free to do what you want, rather than</i><br>
feeling compelled by circumstances or people. Recognizing the world to be<br>
full of opportunities. Being for things, not against things.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(5) Humor: Seeing one's own shortcomings with a sense of humor. Allowing</i><br>
healthy, good-natured humor to reveal new perspectives and combat dogmatic<br>
thinking.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;INFLUENCING OUTCOMES POSITIVELY:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(6) Rational: Using reason rather than being lead by fears and desires.</i><br>
Objectively assessing situations and taking action based on understanding<br>
reality apart from our wishes.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(7) Self-Improving: Optimists see the self as a process and seek continual</i><br>
improvement. Their drive to improve is not pushed by fear but pulled by a<br>
inspiring self-image.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(8) Experimental: Frequently trying fresh approaches, staying out of ruts,</i><br>
actively seeking more effective ways of achieving goals, and being willing<br>
to take calculated risks.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(9) Self-Confident: Believing that we can bring about good things. A</i><br>
fundamental conviction of competence in living.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(10) Self-Worth: Believing one is worthy of success and happiness. Without</i><br>
this, attempts to improve one's life will lack motivation.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(11) Personal Responsibility: Taking charge and creating the conditions</i><br>
for success. Being aware of how we determine our chances of success. This<br>
crucially involves integrity: living according to one's values.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(12) Selecting Environment: Being attracted to positive people and</i><br>
situations. Seeking out those who will support and inspire, not discourage,<br>
distract, and undermine.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;These twelve characteristics of effective optimists give us specific ways</i><br>
of turning the abstract idea of dynamic optimism into actions. Later we<br>
will see how these characteristics or attitudes can be turned into<br>
particular thinking patterns suited to living effectively. I should note<br>
here that the division into interpreting events and influencing outcomes is<br>
intended as a tool for understanding and application. The division should<br>
not be taken as a theoretically watertight one. Some characteristics could<br>
be placed in either category. The two categories go closely together:<br>
positive interpretations tend naturally to lead to positive actions by<br>
changing the focus of your energy and attention, and positive actions can<br>
easily reinforce habits of interpretation.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Optimism, Health, and Success</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If life expansion were only about feeling better it would have limited</i><br>
appeal. While an optimal life certainly should include the goal of feeling<br>
good, we will also want to actually achieve great things and be able to<br>
increase our ability to overcome personal limits. This applies just as much<br>
to the current discussion of optimism. Before exploring in more depth the<br>
characteristics of optimists, I want to cite sound scientific evidence that<br>
optimism really does promote success and health. Some of this evidence<br>
comes from Dr. Martin Seligman. Seligman used the concept of explanatory<br>
style to test the effects of optimism. He compared the effects of<br>
optimistic and pessimistic explanatory styles on success in work,<br>
education, and sports, as well as on health.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Seligman's testing procedure was designed to test the hypothesis that</i><br>
success will be determined not only by aptitude and motivation but also by<br>
optimism. The first major test of the optimism hypothesis was done with the<br>
insurance salesmen of Met Life. Administering the ASQ (Attributional Style<br>
Questionnaire) showed that the more optimistic the salesperson, the less<br>
likely to quit during the first year. Furthermore, the more optimistic, the<br>
more sales made. Seligman followed this initial result, limited to 104<br>
subjects, with a full, carefully-designed study on applicants to Met Life.<br>
One thousand of fifteen thousand applicants were hired, half optimists and<br>
half pessimists, according to the ASQ. 129 applicants were hired despite<br>
having failed the career profile because they scored high in the optimism<br>
test. Normally these candidates would not have been given a job. This group<br>
Seligman dubbed the Special Force. Over the next two years, these were the<br>
results:=20<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the first year, the optimists in the regular force outsold the</i><br>
pessimists, but only by 8 percent. In the second year, the optimists sold<br>
31 percent more. As for the special force, it did beautifully. They outsold<br>
the pessimists in the regular force by 21 percent during the first year,<br>
and by 57 percent in the second year. They even outsold the average of the<br>
regular force over the first two years, by 27 percent. In fact, they sold<br>
at least as much as the optimists in the regular force.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;An optimistic explanatory style had the same effects when examined in</i><br>
educational institutions. 300 freshman in the class of 1987 at the<br>
University of Pennsylvania were given the ASQ. At the end of the first<br>
semester, the students who were more optimistic were doing better. Kamen<br>
and Seligman found that when we look at two people with equal academic<br>
abilities, the more optimistic person tends to get better grades. The<br>
optimists were those who explained their success in terms of enduring<br>
personal characteristics rather than in terms of luck, easy tests, or low<br>
grading standards. Similar results were found when Seligman tested twelve<br>
hundred "plebes" entering West Point military school. The school is so<br>
tough that a hundred usually dropped out before classes even began. West<br>
Point was concerned about the dropout rate and their inability to predict<br>
which candidates would be able to stick it out. After following the results<br>
for two years, Seligman found that the students who quit were the<br>
pessimists: those who blamed bad events on themselves, who believed the bad<br>
thing would last forever, and that it would undermine everything they did.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The linkage of optimism with success has turned up also in studies of</i><br>
sports. The optimists experienced more motivation to succeed and were more<br>
persistent in their efforts. Seligman and his colleagues analyzed numerous<br>
statements by members of teams like the Boston Celtics and the New Jersey<br>
Nets in 1983-84 to predict their performance in the 1984-85 season. They<br>
found that the Celtic optimistically explained away their losses, while the<br>
Nets said things like "We are all missing everything", and "We botched<br>
things up ourselves and blew all our opportunities." The researchers found<br>
that the teams' explanatory styles strongly predicted their level of<br>
success the following season. The same results were found in baseball's<br>
National League. The degree of optimism predicted success even after<br>
allowing for how good the team was, and pessimism predicted failure.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Politics provides another arena in which to test the power of optimism. We</i><br>
see the same results here: One study analyzed the nomination acceptance<br>
speeches of Democratic and Republican presidential candidates between 1948<br>
and 1984. Even after adjusting for the popularity rating of the candidates<br>
according to polls, the candidates who concentrated on negative statements<br>
about the nation's future almost always lost to those who expressed more<br>
optimistic views. The pessimistic candidates lost nine out of ten of the<br>
elections. Adlai Stephenson, unsuccessfully running in 1952, declared, for<br>
example: "The ordeal of the 20th century-the bloodiest, most turbulent era<br>
of the Christian age-is far from over. Sacrifice, patience, and implacable<br>
purpose may be our lot for years to come." His optimistic and successful<br>
opponent, Dwight Eisenhower instead made a clear statement of<br>
problem-solving action: "I will go to Korea."<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Not only does an optimistic attitude make us more likely to succeed,</i><br>
believing that you control your life and can better it promotes good<br>
health. Optimism benefits health in four ways: First, by replacing a sense<br>
of helplessness with a feeling of control, optimism boosts the immune<br>
system. This was demonstrated in rat experiments by Madelon Visintainer.<br>
The rats who learned helplessness through the experimental setup were more<br>
vulnerable to tumor growth than those who were able to shut off the<br>
electric shocks.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Second, optimists will seek medical advice and stick to health programs</i><br>
better than pessimists. The pessimists, telling themselves "It doesn't<br>
matter what I do" will give up easily and fail to seek information and<br>
professional advice. A study of one hundred Harvard graduates showed that<br>
the pessimists were less likely to quit smoking cigarettes than were the<br>
optimists.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Third, the more negative life events a person encounters, the more illness</i><br>
he will probably suffer. If, all in one month, you lose your job, break up<br>
with your spouse, and a friend dies, your chances of becoming ill increase<br>
considerably. Pessimists experience more of these negative events. They<br>
take less action to prevent bad things happening, and when negative events<br>
occur they make them seem worse by thinking persistently, negatively, and<br>
helplessly about them.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fourth, research has shown a clear correlation between resilience against</i><br>
illness and degree of social support. Lonely people who have no close<br>
friends or who withdraw from social engagement when unhappy have a greater<br>
risk of illness and, when ill, are more likely to get worse. Pessimists<br>
take less action to seek support. Optimism wipes away passivity, leading us<br>
to seek out other people. The company of others reduces stress, thereby<br>
boosting the immune system. Others can also help take care of us and<br>
encourage us to take medication, rest, or visit a doctor.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;One of the first studies of the role of pessimism in causing illness was</i><br>
carried out at Virginia Tech in the mid-1980s. The study, following 150<br>
students, found that the optimists had only half as many infectious<br>
illnesses and visits to the doctor as the pessimists. A British study<br>
followed sixty-nine women with breast cancer for five years. Those who<br>
optimistically fought the cancer were less likely to suffer a recurrence<br>
and more likely to survive than those who responded to their diagnosis with<br>
fatalistic passivity. The rare women who survived long term after two bouts<br>
of cancer were those with an optimistic way of thinking. For years it was<br>
suspected that the cancer-prone person was inhibited, conforming, and<br>
depressive, and suppresses feelings rather than expressing them. Evidence<br>
has been accumulating to support this idea. Even more convincingly, the<br>
development of cancer tends to be faster and more severe in those who are<br>
passive than in people who fight the cancer, believing they have some<br>
control. Psychiatrist Arthur Schale has found a higher incidence of cancer<br>
in those who feel helpless and hopeless.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Unsubstantiated and exaggerated claims for the power of the mind to</i><br>
influence the body are easy to find. Yet the evidence now strongly suggests<br>
that the way we think and feel does influence our health to a significant<br>
degree. This should not be terribly surprising. Thoughts take place in<br>
brains, and brains are integrated into the hormonal system. Minds and<br>
brains should be seen as aspects of one system, not as two distinct<br>
objects. One likely mechanism explaining the link between pessimism,<br>
depression and susceptibility to disease is this: When we feel pessimistic,<br>
depressed, or are grieving over the loss of a loved one-a situation likely<br>
to induce a sense of lost control-a group of neurotransmitters (chemical<br>
messengers in the brain) becomes depleted. When catecholamines become<br>
depleted, another group of neurotransmitters, called endorphins, increase<br>
in activity. Endorphins are the body's natural opiates. When endorphins<br>
increase in activity, the immune system turns itself down. A growing number<br>
of studies show that the sense of personal control felt by optimists<br>
clearly boosts the immune system. Not only does optimism feel good, not<br>
only does it make us more successful, it can also save our lives and keep<br>
us in optimal health.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now we have seen evidence supporting the intuitive view that optimism is</i><br>
good for us, we can examine the twelve characteristics in more detail.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;INTERPRETING EXPERIENCES POSITIVELY:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(1) Selective Focus: Unimaginably vast in scope and complexity, reality</i><br>
cannot be fully recognized at any one time. Even that part of reality I<br>
call "my life" contains so many elements, events, phenomena, causes,<br>
consequences, and perspectives that I cannot keep every aspect of it in<br>
focus at any particular moment. No matter how realistic and rational we<br>
are, we have no choice but to focus our attention. Dynamic optimists choose<br>
to focus primarily on thoughts, events, and interpretations that induce<br>
joy, encouragement, pleasure, and constructive activity. Optimists will<br>
look at the same world as pessimists but notice different things, and see<br>
the same things in different ways. One admires a well-tailored suit, the<br>
other cannot see anything but a tiny hole in the jacket. One enjoys the<br>
exertion of climbing a hill, the other worries about getting sweaty.<br>
Optimists spend most of their time focused on opportunities, on being with<br>
people who they enjoy and benefit from, and on thoughts that energize them.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dynamic optimists value rationality. So selective focus does not mean</i><br>
avoiding warning signals, or denying unpleasant events, persons, thoughts,<br>
or feelings. It does mean dwelling on the constructive and enjoyable and<br>
de-emphasizing pain, difficulty, and frustration. The negative aspects of<br>
life can be acknowledged but not fixated upon: Your lower back is sore and<br>
and you will seek to remedy the problem; in the meantime you will enjoy the<br>
movie. Disagreeable events can be placed in a context of learning.<br>
Optimists attend to the downsides of life only to the extent that this will<br>
enable them to move ahead. Preoccupied with encouraging, empowering<br>
thoughts, optimists have little time for dwelling on misery. Optimists can<br>
look at a frustrating event, fully accepting its reality, then choose to<br>
interpret the event in a way that leads to action, growth, and mastery. A<br>
child's irresponsible behavior, for example, can give a parent an<br>
opportunity to improve his communication skills. While the pessimist<br>
focuses on the frustration itself, often excessively and pointlessly, the<br>
optimist keeps the event in proportion, enjoys the rest of life, and looks<br>
for solutions to the challenge. This last word is a key part of the<br>
optimist's vocabulary: Where the pessimist sees problems, the optimist sees<br>
challenges.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If things are going well for an optimist, she often takes that as a sign</i><br>
that things will continue to go well, and that she is therefore capable of<br>
making things go well in other areas of life. If I'm making strong progress<br>
at my exercise routine, I can take it as a sign that I can overcome<br>
difficulties with my finances. If something goes badly, the optimist sees<br>
it as a useful learning experience and focuses on how she will do better in<br>
future. The pessimist thinks through an opposing filter. Some anonymous wit<br>
defined a pessimist as "one who feels bad when he feels good for fear he'll<br>
feel worse when he feels better." Pessimists fixate on everything that<br>
could possibly annoy, frustrate, or harm them. They worry unconstructively.<br>
If something goes well, they refuse to believe it, or they believe it<br>
cannot last. If it goes badly, it shows that everything is getting worse.<br>
Pessimists see every option open to them as crowded with waiting traps,<br>
whether bankruptcy, betrayal, or bereavement. The optimist recognizes the<br>
traps but has a wider vision open to solutions, possibilities, and<br>
assisting forces. By focusing on constructive, joyful, open-ended aspects<br>
of life, the optimist spots more solutions and feels more motivated to<br>
overcome obstacles.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(2) Refraining from Complaining: Accompanying a positive focus we find the</i><br>
optimist a pleasure to be near. She sees more good than bad, more to praise<br>
than to blame, more open paths than closed roads. Even when the optimist<br>
thinks of some negative event, she either keeps it to herself, or speaks of<br>
it only to help others or to seek solutions. Part of not focusing on the<br>
negative is not talking about it pointlessly. The more we complain to<br>
others, the more we notice annoying, frustrating phenomena. Whatever we<br>
focus on expands. Complaining, whining, moaning all make us fix our<br>
attention on our woes. They also make us boring! The less we complain, the<br>
more room exists in our minds for the constructive, the creative, the<br>
delightful. If life sometimes presents tough obstacles, the optimist<br>
recalls the words of Theodore Roosevelt, who said "I wish to preach not the<br>
doctrine of ignoble ease, but the doctrine of strenuous life."<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A common form of complaint heard from pessimistically-focused thinkers</i><br>
sounds like this: "Life isn't fair." "I don't deserve this." "Why me?" When<br>
something bad befalls us, it may be true that we do not deserve it, or that<br>
the world is not fair. But to whine about it can only be irrational. Yes<br>
the world is not fair. It just is. The world was not built for our benefit.<br>
Other people are not here to serve us or to make us happy. When the<br>
pessimist complains of unfairness, they reveal an underlying irrational<br>
belief that life ought to be fair. Living effectively includes recognizing<br>
that the world will continue just being, rather than being fair. Making<br>
ourselves and others miserable by carping about it will get us nowhere.<br>
Such pointless, irrational moaning can only generate resentment. Resentment<br>
leads to anger, hostility, and envy. The optimist expects no fairness<br>
(though is delighted when she finds it). Optimists search out people,<br>
circumstances, and events that will assist them in life. When they run into<br>
opposing forces, they accept them calmly and with good humor look for ways<br>
around the obstacles thrown in their path.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(3) Questioning Limits: Iron-clad limits do exist. You cannot jump unaided</i><br>
from here to the moon. You cannot run faster than light. You cannot make a<br>
million dollars by saying "Shazam!" These kinds of limits have little to do<br>
with the things we want to accomplish in life. The laws of physics (at<br>
least as we currently understand) rule out certain goals but outside that<br>
realm we will have to look hard to find many provably impossible goals.<br>
Most of what we might want to achieve in life, whether it is making<br>
millions, making major breakthroughs in a field of study, becoming famous,<br>
achieving our ideal body, or finding a wonderful life partner, may be<br>
difficult yet many people succeed. For almost any improbable goal, we can<br>
find those who have made their dream a reality. Optimists nurture a<br>
constructive skepticism that challenges the limiting beliefs held by<br>
ourselves, our associates, and our society. Optimists display a deep and<br>
pervasive creative openness to possibilities. They challenge unquestioned,<br>
traditional beliefs about limits where no convincing demonstration of<br>
impossibility has been made. Optimists' confidence in their ability to<br>
achieve their goals cannot easily be shaken.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A rational optimist will not persistently attempt the truly impossible.</i><br>
However, in human affairs we will not often be able to prove an endeavor to<br>
be impossible. Even if we can demonstrate some desired goal to be<br>
impossible, the optimist will not draw unnecessarily frustrating<br>
conclusions. Many limits are limits only within a specific context. We may<br>
be able to change the context and thereby change what is possible. Perhaps<br>
you simply cannot make your fortune in that small town, but the same goal<br>
can be eminently achievable in a large city.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Some of the goals of Life Expansion have long been considered impossible.</i><br>
Extending the human life span past 120 has been declared impossible. Moving<br>
off this planet was considered impossible. Becoming more than human is<br>
still believed by many to be impossible or unthinkable. Dynamic optimists<br>
are especially suspicious of supposed limitations that others claim to be<br>
"sacred", "natural", or inherent in "the divine order". Optimists with a<br>
sense of history and some understanding of current technological<br>
developments see that each of these traditional human limitations may not<br>
be invincible after all. Each age, lacking the necessary vision, will, and<br>
technology, elevates temporary limits to the achievement of our goals to<br>
the status of unalterable facts that must be accepted, even glorified and<br>
worshipped. (If life cannot be extended, why then, mortality must be good<br>
and natural!)<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The dynamic optimist challenges personal and socially accepted limits</i><br>
through the directed application of reason, analysis, and creative thinking<br>
to a problem. The pessimist accepts limits without question, feeling<br>
comfortable with the given, and lacks the drive to search for solutions.<br>
The optimist probes the supposed limits, staying open to new pathways,<br>
applying creativity, and determination. Actor Christopher Reeve has<br>
provided a shining example of a person challenging limits. Instead of<br>
giving up after being severely crippled in a horse-riding accident, he has<br>
persistently pushed himself to regain strength and control. He had the<br>
courage to appear before a billion people at the 1996 Academy Awards. His<br>
example has inspired millions to laugh at the relatively trivial obstacles<br>
in their own lives. The Wright Brothers, the Apollo rocket launches, and<br>
the gerontologists probing at the mechanisms of aging all represent the<br>
optimist's unwillingness to acquiesce in what others see as inevitable<br>
limitations.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(4) Sense of Abundance: Pessimists see the world as full of obstacles and</i><br>
almost empty of options. They feel that someone else's success means their<br>
failure. They see life as what economists call a "zero-sum game"-gains by<br>
one person must be matched by losses for others, so the total gain is zero.<br>
This belief (often unconscious) in limited rewards, limited successes, and<br>
limited options leads to envy and resentment. The effective optimist, by<br>
contrast, understands that everyone can improve their situation. Another<br>
person's success is to be admired, not resented. The success of others not<br>
only does not keep us down, it can help us: success in others provides a<br>
model for us to learn from, and concretely shows that success is possible.<br>
If my friend writes a best-selling book, why then, perhaps I can too!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dynamic optimists feel free to do what they want to do. As self-directed</i><br>
persons driven by positive values rather than fear or envy, they experience<br>
the world as crammed with endless possibilities they can choose from.<br>
Typically, they feel no coercion from people or circumstances to do<br>
anything. All they do is driven by their passions, not by external<br>
pressures. They work at what they love, not because it was their parent's<br>
profession or because it is "respectable". Optimists live with passion,<br>
fixing their attention on what they want to achieve and how they can<br>
achieve it. They appreciate what they have and love the world for all that<br>
it offers. Rather than complaining about having to make a living, for<br>
example, optimists apply their sense of abundance by fully appreciating the<br>
vast range of possible occupations open to them. If they do not possess all<br>
the skills needed for a desired occupation, they learn them. Pessimists<br>
settle for what they see as the "realistic" option.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Crucial to fostering a sense of abundance is being for things, not against</i><br>
things. You may be against many things: crime, war, being overweight, the<br>
budget deficit, intolerance, aging. Optimists restate anything they oppose<br>
in positive terms. Rather than being against government, be for liberty and<br>
responsibility. Rather than being against your company or office manager,<br>
be for making improvements. Instead of saying no to drugs, say yes to<br>
healthy pleasures. I am not merely playing a word game here: Your energy<br>
goes wherever you focus your attention. When you are against something you<br>
will expend your time and energy attacking it, complaining about it, and<br>
reacting to it. When you are for an alternative, you focus on changing it,<br>
creating alternatives, exciting others about new options, and feeling<br>
productive and creative-you will be proactive rather than reactive. Being<br>
for things, and a strong sense of abundance creates personal energy. An<br>
optimistic sense of abundance encourages cheerfulness and activity. In a<br>
high-energy optimistic state you want to tackle tasks because you expect to<br>
enjoy the activity and expect to make progress at it. This creates a<br>
self-reinforcing cycle: Optimism breeds increased enthusiasm; this leads to<br>
effort and progress which validates optimism and generates more of it. The<br>
virtuous circle of optimism replaces the vicious circle of pessimism.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(5) Humor: Humor acts both as a cause and a consequence of dynamic</i><br>
optimism. Not surprisingly, optimists, being cheerful types, will tend to<br>
see more humor in everyday events than gloomy pessimists. Feeling good<br>
lends itself to spotting funny incongruities and enjoyable oddnesses.<br>
Pessimists, if humorous at all, display a more cynical, snide, nasty form<br>
of humor. Humor for them provides a way of tearing down and deriding the<br>
accomplishments and character of others. More surprisingly, humor adds to<br>
optimism. Since optimism requires an openness to new possibilities and<br>
different perspectives, it helps to be able to laugh at dogmatic thinking<br>
in ourselves and others. Healthy, good-natured humor can reveal fresh<br>
approaches. Humor will be particularly helpful when the rigidity or<br>
irrationality is found in ourselves. Without humor, we may lock up<br>
emotionally, defending to the death the wisdom of what we are doing and who<br>
are. With humor, we can look on our shortcomings with amusement. Most humor<br>
involves seeing old things from unexpected angles. This explains the power<br>
of humor to promote self-transformation: We will find it easier to change<br>
ourselves if we can use humor to step aside from who we are right now and<br>
see who we could become. Nietzsche told us that laughter means "to rejoice<br>
at another's expense, but with a good conscience". We can laugh at our own<br>
foibles with a good conscience because humor allows us to separate our core<br>
sense of identity from the foolishness we currently see in ourselves.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;INFLUENCING OUTCOMES POSITIVELY:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(6) Rational: Being rational means doing our best to see reality as it is</i><br>
rather than as we want it to be. Rationality involves apportioning our<br>
belief according to the evidence: withholding commitment to unsupported<br>
beliefs, even if we want them to be true; not being certain of uncertain<br>
ideas; and always being open to revision of beliefs as new evidence and new<br>
reasons appear. The dynamic optimist applies reason to find ways of<br>
assessing and achieving goals, and does not confuse what he wishes to be<br>
true with what is true. Blind, wishful optimism is not dynamic optimism, it<br>
is an irrational optimism or faith in an unreal world. The rational<br>
optimist-the optimist who works with reality rather than against<br>
it-separates his emotional urges from his understanding as far as possible.<br>
The rational optimist thinks critically and logically about the world<br>
around him. He also turns the bright light of reason on himself, examining<br>
the causes and reasons of his motivations and beliefs about himself.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Rational optimism means using reason to discover what truly works. Reason</i><br>
involves learning how to assess evidence for claims, how to analyze<br>
arguments, assess motivations, figure out who and what to believe and how<br>
far to believe it. Is supplemental vitamin E good for my health? Should I<br>
invest in stocks or bonds? Should I believe the claims of homeopathy?<br>
Should I always trust my intuitions? Reason also involves ensuring that<br>
that your goals are attainable and that you have chosen effective means to<br>
them, and making sure your goals are consistent and coherent together.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(7) Self-Improving: Dynamic optimists see themselves in transformational</i><br>
terms-they see the self as a process, not a static entity. Optimists<br>
recognize the possibilities for continuing growth, self-correction, and<br>
self-improvement. Rather than seeing their current psychology and<br>
personality as the ultimate form of themselves, optimists view it as a<br>
transition to a better self. If we are to expand our lives, overcoming<br>
limits to achievement and happiness, we need to detach ourselves from who<br>
we are today. More fundamentally we need to see ourselves as an<br>
evolutionary process of ever-improving development. Our current<br>
personalities serve as one link in the chain of our being. As Henri Bergson<br>
said in Creative Evolution: "To exist is to change, to change is to mature,<br>
to mature is to go on creating oneself endlessly."<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The powerful drive to improve, to overcome existing limitations in the</i><br>
self, in optimists is not pushed by fear or self-dislike. This drive is<br>
pulled by an inspiring self-image. Optimists form an image of who they want<br>
to become and use it as a guide for action. They stride towards their<br>
ideals rather than running away from who they are now. They seek to become<br>
beautiful, not to cover their ugliness; they patiently strive for calmness<br>
rather than berating themselves for their bad temper. Optimists feel a<br>
basic sense of happiness, but it is a happiness without self-satisfaction.<br>
The drive to self-transformation comes not from a rejection of the self,<br>
but from an identification with the self's continual process of maturation<br>
and strengthening. Optimists recognize the natural law: Grow or die out. To<br>
remain the same leads to stagnation and to falling behind, especially in<br>
the modern world's frantic and accelerating rate of change. Dynamic<br>
optimists seek to be not masters of the present, but masters of<br>
transformation.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The drive for self-transformation, perpetual self-improvement,</i><br>
distinguishes the dynamic optimist from the passive optimist. The latter<br>
sits back, does nothing, and tells himself that everything will work out<br>
fine, and that he need not make any effort to improve his approach to<br>
living. The dynamic optimist acts on the recognition that continual<br>
transcendence of personal limits fuels success, achievement, and happiness.<br>
As Goethe tells us in The Mysteries:<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;All force strives forward to work far and wide To live and grow and ever</i><br>
to expand; Yet we are checked and thwarted on each side By the world's flux<br>
and swept along like sand: In this internal storm and outward tide We hear<br>
a promise, hard to understand: From the compulsion that all creatures<br>
binds, Who overcomes himself, his freedom finds.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(8) Experimental: Pessimists and passive optimists both cling to the old</i><br>
and familiar, the authorized, regulated and approved. The dynamic optimist<br>
will be among the first to adopt more effective practices. Effective<br>
optimism requires more than a belief that things will improve; it requires<br>
actively searching for and creating novel approaches. Certainly the<br>
optimist eagerly learns from culturally entrenched practices, whether these<br>
are ways of organizing a business, principles for a marriage, or methods of<br>
boosting athletic performance. Yet he will put no unquestioning faith in<br>
ideas simply because they are old and widely accepted. The optimist<br>
evaluates each idea, each method on its merits, being quick to try fresh<br>
approaches where they appear to offer advantages. The optimistic<br>
personality continually seeks out better ways of doing things, jumps out of<br>
ruts before they can wear deep, and questions dogmas and unthinking<br>
traditions. Nietzsche expressed this urgent drive to challenge the old:<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;...Not to question, not to tremble with the craving and joy of</i><br>
questioning... that is what I feel to be contemptible, and this feeling is<br>
the first thing I seek in everyone: some foolishness persuades me ever and<br>
again that every human being has this feeling, as a human being.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As Nietzsche recognized with disappointment, many humans do not share this</i><br>
joy of questioning. Pessimists and passive optimists feel comfortable and<br>
satisfied with the accepted and traditional. Only dynamic optimists exhibit<br>
a fundamental openness to new and better paths. An optimistic attitude<br>
encourages openness to new sources of information and new methods of<br>
improving life. When it forms part of your personality, an actively<br>
optimistic attitude programs your brain to apprehend opportunities and<br>
possibilities. This open, experimental attitude will both see more new<br>
approaches and show more willingness to try them out. By applying his<br>
experimental attitude, the dynamic optimist becomes intensely creative.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Willingness to experiment implies a tolerance for risk-taking. Remembering</i><br>
the importance of rationality, this does not mean wild, random risk-taking,<br>
but a willingness to assume calculated risks for anticipated benefits. We<br>
might think that sticking with widely accepted methods is safe, but where<br>
improvement is needed, failing to experiment is itself risky. The optimist<br>
heeds the advice of Thomas Watson, founder of computer giant IBM, who told<br>
us: "The way to succeed is to double your failure rate." Optimists see the<br>
self as a process not a static entity. This allows them to identify with<br>
improving their ideas, methods, and practices, rather than desperately<br>
needing to be seen as right. Optimists, expecting success or at least<br>
learning from their experiments, will not be paralyzed by fear of failure.<br>
They keep their mind on their goals, unlike pessimists who shy away from<br>
uncertain attempts because they entertain all the possible undesirable<br>
outcomes while feeling that being mistaken means being failures and fools.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(9) Self-Confident: We all feel confident in specific areas of life. You</i><br>
might be confident when playing tennis, or in closing a deal, or in giving<br>
a speech. But you might lack confidence in changing a diaper, replacing<br>
your computer's hard drive, or singing in tune. The dynamic optimist cannot<br>
help but lack competence in numerous areas, yet retaining a solid<br>
confidence. Self-confidence means not confidence in specific areas, but a<br>
fundamental conviction that I am competent to live. I may lack a skill or<br>
ability needed to get a particular job or to solve a relationship<br>
difficulty, but I feel confident that I can acquire those skills. I feel<br>
assured that I can think up or discover existing solutions, or find someone<br>
with sound advice. If a person lacks this basic sense of self-confidence, a<br>
pervasive pessimism will be hard to avoid. Acquiring self-confidence<br>
requires an effort; anyone promising to deliver it to you in one quick<br>
painless fix is lying. The underlying confidence I refer to comes from<br>
repeated experiences of successful learning and problem-solving, each of<br>
which takes attention and effort. By repeatedly achieving, as well as<br>
recognizing and celebrating our achievements, we can build self-confidence.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;While the passive optimist hopes that someone else will make the future</i><br>
better, the dynamic optimist believes he can and will bring about what he<br>
wants. He does not leave the future up to passive hoping and wishing, he<br>
takes action. If he wants a more enjoyable job, he does not wait for an<br>
offer, he goes out and searches for one, confident that he has the<br>
necessary skills or that he can acquire them. Effective optimism implies<br>
confidence in being able to create the future we want. Self-confidence<br>
generates persistence by giving us the power to keep trying in the face of<br>
resistance and setbacks. With self-confidence we will continue making an<br>
effort until we finally overcome all obstacles. Pessimists, believing<br>
desirable goals to be unattainable, do not persist. In giving up so soon,<br>
and thereby failing, they reinforce their sense of personal inefficacy.<br>
Pervasive pessimism in a person goes hand in hand with a self-image<br>
conveying failure, inability and resignation. A drive towards<br>
self-improvement and a willingness to experiment with novel approaches<br>
cannot exist without self-confidence.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(10) Self-Worth: Self-confidence combines with self-worth to form</i><br>
self-esteem. Whereas self-confidence means a fundamental sense that I am<br>
competent to live and flourish, self-worth means a sense that I deserve to<br>
live. Some unfortunate individuals lack self-worth, sometimes due to<br>
destructive parents who continually undermined them as children, and<br>
sometimes due to religious doctrines proclaiming that we are inherently<br>
evil, corrupt, and unworthy. While we can practice dynamic optimism even<br>
without a sense of self-worth, believing that we are worthy of success and<br>
happiness makes optimism far easier. How motivated will a person be to<br>
create the conditions for his success if he believes he does not deserve to<br>
flourish? How strongly will he pursue happiness if he believes he deserves<br>
to be punished? This motivation may still exist: the person might be<br>
motivated to achieve in order to serve someone else, or as an offering to a<br>
god. Such externally-based motivation risks building resentment. Self-worth<br>
bonded to self-confidence forms a powerful core of self-esteem. When<br>
self-esteem suffuses our personality, we can forcefully tackle any new<br>
challenge with assurance.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(11) Personal Responsibility: Effective optimism requires understanding</i><br>
the part we play in bringing about the results we want. The passive<br>
optimist, with his comfortable faith that other people and institutions<br>
will do it all, refuses to acknowledge his own role. I cannot endorse the<br>
common New Age belief that we entirely create our own reality. Yet our own<br>
thinking and action does radically affect our chances of success. Unlike<br>
the passive optimist, the dynamic optimist realizes that goals can be<br>
reliably achieved only through personal effort. Wishful thinking cannot<br>
substitute for active pursuit of the life we want. Taking responsibility<br>
for ourselves requires a strong sense of purpose. Without a clear vision of<br>
our destination we will find it hard to get anywhere. Being responsible<br>
asks of us self-discipline: as we make our choices through the day we need<br>
to keep our goals and values in mind, stay focused, and resist<br>
distractions. More than that, taking responsibility means persisting at<br>
working toward what matters to us. Persistence and perseverance are virtues<br>
of character found in all successful persons. Standing out as a great model<br>
of persistence, Thomas Edison tried endless combinations of materials and<br>
structures before finally creating the light bulb. His mind stayed focused<br>
tightly on his goal, allowing no doubts to stop him, and he persisted<br>
through hundreds of failed attempts.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Personal responsibility combines psychological characteristics with</i><br>
ethical values. Being responsible involves more than personal effort,<br>
focus, and persistence. It also requires integrity: living according to<br>
your values. An integrated personality has developed a consistent and<br>
rational set of values conducive to successful living. If we profess our<br>
values yet live according to whim, social pressures, or expediency, we will<br>
find ourselves pulled in opposing directions. Lack of integrity saps our<br>
will by pitting our values against our outward words and deeds. Like a car<br>
trying to move with its parking brake on, we will struggle harder to create<br>
the life we want if we give up our integrity. Living with integrity is<br>
profoundly practical, not merely a nice abstract ideal. Taking<br>
responsibility for keeping our words and actions consistent with our values<br>
means exercising our autonomy-our ability to make our own choices even in<br>
the face of external pressures. Being responsible for ourselves can be a<br>
great challenge when surrounding us we find government programs to take<br>
care of us, and authority figures wanting to run our lives (whether these<br>
are parents, gurus, or officials). These stealers of responsibility seduce<br>
us by offering ease and security if we will only give up personal control<br>
and let them make the decisions. But once we give up our autonomy and<br>
responsibility to others, we also give up our control over our future.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(12) Selecting Environment: We can maintain an optimistic, creative,</i><br>
solution-finding attitude in any environment. The ability to separate our<br>
thinking, to choose how we feel and act, is an aspect of our autonomy as<br>
humans. Even in the Nazi death camps, some stayed alive and sane by<br>
focusing their thoughts on their hopes and on what they could control.<br>
Clearly, though, we will find it far easier to persist in a dynamically<br>
optimistic approach to life when surrounded by others who fuel us rather<br>
than drain us. Some of us may be unfortunate enough to live and work with<br>
those who continually tell us why we cannot do what we want, why our<br>
efforts are doomed to fail, and who point to all the possible obstacles and<br>
relate tales of every failure they have heard of. While stuck in such an<br>
environment we will need to maintain more vigilance over our own thinking.<br>
If we find ourselves smothered in this miasma, we would do well to devote<br>
plenty of effort to changing our circumstances. This may mean changing jobs<br>
or offices, or fending off negative co-workers, relatives, or acquaintances.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dynamic optimists will find themselves attracted to persons and</i><br>
environments that inspire, support, and assist, not those that discourage,<br>
distract, and undermine. Still, we should take this recommendation in the<br>
context of the other characteristics of a dynamic optimist, and not take it<br>
to an extreme in isolation. Since success requires a clear understanding of<br>
the world as it really is, not as we wish it to be, we need to place<br>
ourselves among those who will not always agree with us. If we hear only<br>
agreement from those who think just like us, we will fall into a distorted<br>
view of the world. Our beliefs, values, and goals need to be tested,<br>
questioned, challenged. Only by surviving the criticism of others (and<br>
ourselves) or mutating into new forms can our beliefs and goals offer any<br>
assurance of being realistic. The optimist will therefore select the<br>
environment so as to surround himself not with only those who agree with<br>
him, but with those who will either agree and support him or<br>
constructively, reasonably, usefully criticize his goals and methods.<br>
Hostile, destructive criticism can still be useful, but is harder to learn<br>
from and can undermine our motivation. The dynamic optimist carefully<br>
selects the environment to achieve a balance of support with constructive<br>
disagreement.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Optimism and Uncertainty</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Bertrand Russell, one of the most prolific and long-lived philosophers of</i><br>
the 20th century, pointed out that: "Many people would sooner die than<br>
think. In fact they do." Russell's barbed observation continues to be all<br>
too true. At this stage in human development, most of us display a deep<br>
desire for certainty. Is this due to culture or our biological nature?<br>
Given the cross-cultural persistence of the need for certainty, I suspect<br>
it is partly rooted in our evolutionary past. Back in our hunter-gatherer<br>
days, those who were uncertain about whether to run, how to throw a spear<br>
or stone, or whether to mate, were likely to die, their genes being forever<br>
taken out of the gene pool. The choices then were relatively simple. Quick,<br>
decisive, certain choices probably conferred a survival advantage. If a<br>
tendency toward certainty and the dogmatic thinking that results really is<br>
built into our brain, advanced genetic technology may be the only effective<br>
way to remedy it. In the meantime, only those who remain aware of this<br>
tendency, and strive continually to combat it in themselves, will have a<br>
chance of being the rational beings philosophers have long proclaimed us to<br>
be.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We find it more comfortable to believe things with certainty. Certainty</i><br>
assures us we need look no further: we have found the final, unalterable<br>
truth. We need not think, we need not make new decisions, we need not<br>
experiment or question ourselves. The desperate desire for certainty<br>
insinuates itself into every aspect of our lives but especially in the area<br>
of religious and political beliefs. Dogmatic religious beliefs extol<br>
certainty, even making faith-belief in something despite the evidence-into<br>
a virtue. This attitude toward certainty and dogmatic faith was stated in<br>
an especially unapologetic and extreme form by the Church father Tertullian:<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;After Jesus we have no need of speculation, after the Gospel no need of</i><br>
research. When we come to believe, we have no desire to believe anything<br>
else; for we begin by believing that there is nothing else we have to=<br>
 believe.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Certainty reduces our chances of succeeding in many situations because it</i><br>
prevents us opening ourselves to new sources of information. It leads us to<br>
conclude further investigation and experimentation to be a waste of time.<br>
The emotional reward that keeps people coming back to certainty like a<br>
favorite drug is its ability to pacify us, to soothe us, and to relieve us<br>
of responsibility. Optimism tainted with dogmatic certainty can appeal to<br>
us since it lets us believe that success requires no action, or at least no<br>
new action. If you feel certain that a desired event or outcome will occur,<br>
you need not contribute to bringing it about. If you hold a belief with<br>
certainty you need not go to the trouble of looking for contrary evidence.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Unfortunately we cannot draw a sharp, unmistakable dividing line between</i><br>
dynamic optimism and passive optimism and its reliance on certainty.<br>
Keeping in mind the twelve characteristics of the dynamic optimist will<br>
help keep optimism active and open. It is up to us to guard against<br>
allowing our dynamically optimistic thinking to degenerate into passive<br>
Pollyanna optimism. We cannot reliably distinguish rationally and<br>
irrationally optimistic beliefs on the basis of the strength of those<br>
beliefs (though this can be one indication). Faith, or dogmatically<br>
optimistic beliefs can be weak, though this is generally an unstable state,<br>
and many perfectly ordinary beliefs are extremely strongly held. For<br>
instance, I am very sure that I currently live in Southern California, that<br>
the Earth orbits the sun and that I am biologically male. How can we<br>
distinguish life expanding optimism from dogmatic optimism? Let me<br>
emphasize some of the twelve characteristic of dynamic optimists to help<br>
with this question:<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Both kinds of optimistic thinking involve selective focus, or selective</i><br>
filtering of information and experience, but in different ways. Dogmatic<br>
optimists refuse to consider evidence that things are not going the way<br>
they want. They avert their eyes from obstacles to their goals. They see<br>
only encouraging signs while blanking out disturbing signs. The dynamic<br>
optimist uses selective focus differently: He chooses not to dwell<br>
endlessly and pointlessly on unpleasant and unchangeable events or persons.<br>
He remains open to recognizing and accepting obstacles to his goals. Rather<br>
than blind himself to them, he sees them as challenges, and thinks<br>
cheerfully, creatively, and openly about how to deal with them.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We have seen that dynamic optimists continually seek to improve</i><br>
themselves. While valuing who they are now, they strive to become ever<br>
better. They may be satisfied with their progress, but they are never<br>
self-satisfied in thinking they are the best they can be. To prevent life<br>
expanding optimism from decaying into self-satisfied passive optimism check<br>
your behavior over time. Have you stopped looking for ways to improve? Do<br>
you approach every conversation as a chance to show the other fellow where<br>
he's gone wrong? Have you made real progress with your goals, or are you<br>
just telling yourself that you have or you will start to "real soon now"?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We can check our optimism also by noting our degree of rationality and</i><br>
experimentalism. You may be facing a problem or choice: Whether to stay<br>
with this job or change companies or professions; whether to tell the truth<br>
or lie to stay out of a conflict; whether to vote for government welfare or<br>
subsidies or to oppose them. How do you go about making these decisions? Do<br>
you look for answers and solutions always in the same places? Is there one<br>
book that you look to every time for certain answers? Do you stick with<br>
what you have always done in the past? Do you look at information always<br>
from the same sources, or do you consult diverging books, magazines,<br>
speakers? Dynamic optimists never rely on dogmatic authorities (though they<br>
will listen for possible wisdom even from self-proclaimed gurus or<br>
authorities), whether these are living persons, massive institutions, or<br>
old books. The dynamic optimist tries to think as a critical<br>
rationalist-someone who leaves everything open to question and who treats<br>
no authority as an absolute guarantee of truth. Rather than being disturbed<br>
by having his beliefs or favorite sources challenged, the rational optimist<br>
welcomes feedback and new perspectives. (This does not mean wasting time<br>
with uninformative fools who only want to impose their ill-formed ideas on<br>
anyone within reach.) You can feel confident that your optimism remains<br>
rational and effective so long as you see plenty of signs of continued<br>
searching, critical experimentation, and personal responsibility for<br>
learning in open ways.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The active and passive forms of optimism differ in an obvious way when it</i><br>
comes to the issue of personal responsibility. The passive optimist<br>
believes that he will succeed in his endeavors, or circumstances will<br>
improve, not as a result of his own efforts but primarily or solely because<br>
of external factors. If someone expects their problems to be solved by the<br>
government, their parents, their spouse, or a god, they abdicate personal<br>
responsibility for their lives. You can spot the slide from dynamic to<br>
passive optimism if you see yourself no longer taking action to better your<br>
circumstances, instead sitting back and thinking someone else will take of<br>
it. Dynamic optimists realize that they cannot control other people, only<br>
themselves. They place confidence in their own ability to change the shape<br>
of the future. They jump in and actively set about creating the outcome<br>
they desire.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Adopting certain habits and practices can help guard against letting our</i><br>
dynamically optimistic thinking deteriorate into the more common passive<br>
form. The crucial first step involves thoroughly understanding the<br>
characteristics of the dynamic optimist and how they differ from the<br>
passive optimist. Once that understanding has been absorbed deep down, we<br>
will find it easier to detect and prevent the infiltration of passive<br>
thinking. As part of regular daily and weekly meditation and life-review<br>
habits, we can check our recent thinking and behavior. Regular sessions for<br>
setting personal goals and priorities provide an opportunity for a reality<br>
check. These sessions give us a quiet time in which to reassess short-term<br>
and long-term goals and the effectiveness of the means being used. During<br>
meditation sessions we can renew our optimistic perspective, rooting out<br>
pessimism, while also checking that our optimism remains active and open.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another way to maintain a high level of optimism while avoiding</i><br>
intellectual passivity and certainty is to subject your ideas to evaluation<br>
by others of similar commitment. Such individuals and groups should also be<br>
oriented towards a rational, active optimism. Such persons allow you to<br>
test your ideas and goals in an environment both friendly and able to<br>
restrain unbridled flights of fantasy. Testing your ideas in groups that<br>
are fundamentally opposed to your goals, or who cannot comprehend them, is<br>
neither encouraging nor enlightening. Testing your ideas in supportive yet<br>
critical and analytical communities is vital.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Optimistic Thinking</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Once we understand dynamic optimism thoroughly we have taken a giant leap</i><br>
toward being able to implement it fully in our lives. Shaping our thinking<br>
in an optimistic direction will be easier if we have some specific ideas of<br>
what to watch for in our thinking. I can only briefly explain a handful of<br>
these mental patterns here. I refer the reader to the Resources for more<br>
writings and workshops on the subject. Cognitive psychologists such as<br>
David Burns and Albert Ellis have done us a great service in clearly<br>
identifying many thinking patterns typically found in pessimists and<br>
depressed persons. Since my focus is on the positive-on becoming ever<br>
better than we are-rather than on the negative side of what causes<br>
depression and lack of motivation, I will point out a few positive<br>
correlates of the thinking patterns identified by these therapists.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;PARTICULARIZE: When the optimist has been frustrated by obstacles to his</i><br>
goals, he reacts appropriately: He inspects the obstacle and sees it for<br>
what it is, then considers how to remove it. The pessimist, especially if<br>
depressed, does the opposite. A depressed person will see a single negative<br>
event as an endless pattern of defeat. A woman went for a first job<br>
interview. Being nervous and inexperienced she performed at less than her<br>
best and was not called back for a second interview at the firm. She told<br>
herself: "I never get a break. I'm so rotten at this that no one will<br>
employ me. What's the use?" From a single experience she irrationally<br>
overgeneralizes to a belief about all future interview experiences. A shy<br>
teenage boy asked out a girl he was attracted to. Being insensitive or<br>
perhaps simply not knowing how to respond any other way, she told him "Only<br>
in your dreams." The boy tells himself: "I'm ugly and boring. No girl will<br>
go out with me." Overgeneralizations like this can turn into<br>
self-fulfilling prophecies since the irrational belief leads the person to<br>
refrain from more attempts. With no more attempts to get an interview or a<br>
date, there can be no successes and so the person's belief seems to be<br>
confirmed.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The optimist refrains from overgeneralizing. Effective thinkers look at</i><br>
the frustrating situation as a particular event. That event need not<br>
represent any pattern; it can lead to very different future events if<br>
treated as a learning experience. If the woman going for the interview had<br>
been aware of her thinking, she might have stopped the self-defeating<br>
cognition, instead telling herself: "Well, I didn't do so well at my first<br>
attempt. I'll do better next time. Now I know better what to expect. Let's<br>
see, I could practice my responses to the questions I was asked, I could<br>
sit straighter and speak up confidently, and I could take more initiative<br>
in asking questions when given the opportunity." Similarly, the rejected<br>
boy might have reminded himself that this girl might have been having a bad<br>
day, and not all other girls would react the same way. He might ask himself<br>
if he contributed to her response, perhaps by being too tentative, and<br>
consider how to come across more engagingly. The optimistic response to a<br>
bad experience is to look at it as a particular event, not an omen of<br>
perpetual failure, and to learn from it in order to correct course and home<br>
in on the desired goal.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;EMPHASIZE THE POSITIVE: Depression-prone individuals usually suffer from</i><br>
anhedonia-the inability to enjoy anything. One cause of this is their<br>
tendency to disqualify their positive experiences. Even non-depressive,<br>
hard-driven Type A personalities can fall into this trap. Upon being given<br>
a major promotion with raise in pay and benefits, an executive immediately<br>
started worrying about her new responsibilities. She did not hold a party<br>
to celebrate, turned down friends' invitations to dinner to congratulate<br>
her, and forgot about all the ways she earned the promotion. A man in his<br>
sixties who has exercised for years and maintained sound diet and health<br>
habits was complimented on his trim, youthful appearance. "I'm just lucky"<br>
he replied. Have you ever replied to a compliment or commendation with<br>
phrases like "You're just being nice", "It was nothing really", or "It<br>
doesn't really count for anything"? If so, you have disqualified your<br>
positive experiences. When this becomes a pattern, we deplete our<br>
motivation and darken our view of the world. Having pushed aside our<br>
joyful, successful, affirming experiences, we are left looking only at our<br>
mistakes, shortcomings, and setbacks. Even if someone has enough motivation<br>
or self-discipline to keep accomplishing things despite disqualifying the<br>
positive, he will derive little pleasure from his successes. If our goal is<br>
to both move forward in our lives and enjoy doing so, we need to affirm our<br>
positive experiences.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The dynamic optimist does not need to seek approval, and does not abuse</i><br>
compliments by puffing himself up in a falsely self-aggrandizing manner. On<br>
the other hand, the optimist can confidently acknowledge compliments and<br>
rewards. Instead of replying with "It was nothing", he says "Thank you".<br>
The optimist celebrates both his own and other people's successes, enjoys<br>
each victory and advance, and appreciates what he has earned. While the<br>
optimist looks forward to tackling new responsibilities and to moving on to<br>
fresh goals after achieving old ones, he does not forget to appreciate the<br>
efforts that got him where he is.=20<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;SET REALISTIC GOALS AND STANDARDS: The tendency to disqualify the positive</i><br>
often festers side by side with the vice of perfectionism. Optimism has<br>
nothing to do with wanting to be perfect. Optimism as I have explained it<br>
involves a confident drive to continually improve oneself and one's<br>
circumstances. But not only does continual improvement not require<br>
perfection, it is not even compatible with it. If you are perfect, or<br>
believe you are, you have no room for further improvement.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Optimists expect to do well and to keep getting better. They feel no need</i><br>
to be perfect or do a job perfectly. They do not have to mow the lawn<br>
magnificently, just well enough. They do not need to write to their friends<br>
with unprecedented wit and skill; they just need to say things clearly. By<br>
setting realistic goals and standards for themselves, optimists succeed<br>
more often, thereby reinforcing their optimism and motivation. If I feel I<br>
must ski not just well but perfectly, I will get frustrated and angry at<br>
myself for being only fairly good. Since I know I will not ski perfectly<br>
next time, I am likely to avoid trying it again. Perfectionism, by setting<br>
us up for failure, may discourage us from ever starting on a project. If we<br>
do start we may leave it unfinished, so we can tell ourselves: "Well, if I<br>
had finished it, it would have been superb." If we do finish the project,<br>
we will be unable to fully enjoy the imperfect result. We can see<br>
perfectionism as an example of black-and-white, all-or-nothing thinking.<br>
Either we must do a job superbly, magnificently, with unprecedented<br>
excellence, or it is not worth doing at all. Thinking more rationally,<br>
optimists breeze past the perfectionist, content to simply do things well<br>
or even adequately and then to do them better the next time.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Many of us feel drawn to perfectionist attitudes because we believe this</i><br>
to help us perform at our best. Consider some reasons why perfectionism can<br>
have the opposite result, apart from discouraging us in the first place:<br>
Facing such a lofty standard you may get so nervous that you cannot perform<br>
well. You may be too afraid to experiment with uncertain procedures that<br>
might produce superior results. You may be afraid to make mistakes that<br>
could reveal useful information. Turning perfectionist standards outward to<br>
other people, you will become intolerant of others and may drive them away.<br>
Since perfection is almost never attainable-or even definable (how would<br>
you run a marathon perfectly?)-you will always feel frustrated, unhappy,<br>
and bitter so long as you put perfectionism in place of realistic goals and<br>
standards.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;KEEP EVENTS IN PROPORTION: A woman went to pick up her car from the</i><br>
mechanic, expecting it to be fixed by 3pm. She was looking forward to<br>
meeting a date at 4pm on the other side of town. Smiling tightly at her,<br>
the mechanic explained that he hadn't been able to fix the engine trouble<br>
yet, and would have to keep the car for another couple of hours. "You're<br>
ruining my life!" the woman shouted. This exaggeration in thinking afflicts<br>
almost all of us sometimes, and some of us all too frequently. The<br>
housecleaners do an imperfect job and we complain "Everyone's incompetent!"<br>
Perhaps you notice a minor mistake on a report for your company after it<br>
has been printed for everyone to read. "How awful!" you tell yourself.<br>
"That's terrible. How could I be so sloppy? Everyone will think I'm an<br>
idiot. Damn it!"<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We can call this kind of negative exaggeration magnification or</i><br>
catastrophizing. It involves blowing up a minor irritation into a major<br>
calamity. The old clich=8E about making mountains out of molehills arose fro=<br>
m<br>
someone noticing how some of us like to turn small annoyances and<br>
frustrations into world-shaking (or at least life-threatening)<br>
catastrophes. We feel so much more important when every little setback can<br>
be seen as a dramatic cataclysm in the epic of our life! Unfortunately, the<br>
drama is a tragedy, where each day we are fated to suffer incalculable<br>
misery. Cognitive therapist David Burns has referred to this distortion in<br>
thinking as "the binocular trick". You look at negative events in such a<br>
way as to blow them up in size and importance. If you tend to compare<br>
yourself to others, you might also magnify the other fellow's<br>
accomplishment, making yourself feel more threatened by comparison. The<br>
binocular trick works from the other end too, in which case we call it<br>
minimization. Here you look through the other end of the binoculars at your<br>
accomplishments (or your competitors imperfections) and shrink them down to<br>
an insignificant size. When we regularly practice the binocular trick we<br>
overwhelm ourselves. Obstacles to achieving our goals appear enormous; they<br>
become mountains too high and rocky to climb. Our motivation drains away,<br>
leaving us apathetic and unproductive.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The dynamic optimist, being aware of this seductive tendency to</i><br>
catastrophize, strives to keep events in proportion. Life as a dramatic<br>
tragedy is replaced with life as a balanced, steady march forward, drama<br>
finding its place in the major accomplishments in one's life. Attaining a<br>
developed ability to keep things in proportion can take self-discipline for<br>
many of us. Letting one's destructive emotions run wild may feel easy. In<br>
addition, we may believe that we can get what we want more effectively by<br>
exaggerating our hurt. Indeed this can be an effective short-term method of<br>
manipulating others, but not a healthy or effective long-term approach. It<br>
will lead to a loss of respect from others, avoidance of involvement in our<br>
little dramas, and distract us from directly and rationally confronting<br>
obstacles.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Developing and strengthening this dynamic, practical optimism is one of</i><br>
the most effective ways of adding to our personal power. A thorough-going<br>
dynamic optimist cannot be stopped. He cannot be pushed aside, blocked out,<br>
or shut down. He will respond to all obstacles, all attacks, all setbacks<br>
with calmness, determination, and a creative, problem-solving attitude.<br>
Optimism and pessimism affect our entire worldview. Our whole approach to<br>
living will be either empowered or chained depending on which style of<br>
thinking predominates. The principles of dynamic optimism provide keys for<br>
unlocking our full potential.<br>
