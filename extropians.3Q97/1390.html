 "the technology necessary for constructing a 'smart dust particle' may<br>
 be within reach in 5 years, says Berlin."<br>
 <br>
 "By merging sensing and actuation with computation and communication,<br>
 MEMS [microelectriomechanical systems] devices can be distributed<br>
 throughout the environment, coated on surfaces, or embedded within<br>
 everyday objects to create distributed systems for sensing, reasoning<br>
 about, and responding to events in the physical world on a scale never<br>
 before possible", wrote Berlin &amp; Gabriel in their IEEE article.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Now that I've got a little bit more time let me try to expand upon the idea I<br>
so frenticly sketched ealier.<br>
<p>
Imagine:<br>
<p>
A (corn,maize,cotton,bean,you-name-it)field.....one of the big midwestern<br>
ones...one of the small new england ones....even a garden.  From a central<br>
location there arises a tower...tall and slender...a communication<br>
antenna...designed for high band width...multiple simultaneous two-way<br>
communications...within the confines of the field...connected to...the<br>
internet.<br>
<p>
Enter our hero.  Call him Johnny   Our intreped adventurer is that most<br>
bloodthirsty of earths creatures...a young male human.  Johnny walks into his<br>
bedroom...and dons telelprescense gear...and dials THE number.  He accesses<br>
his account...selects a "droid" and enters the fray.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the base of the above mentioned tower a small flier (bug size or</i><br>
slightly larger) emerges.  It is data-linked  to the tower and thence to<br>
Johnny. Johnny controls it as would a fighter pilot controls his craft. As<br>
far as Johnny is concerned his is IN the craft...in some models he may BE the<br>
craft. It may be equipped with weapons (laser,sonic,maser) or merely have<br>
fangs, claws or talons (or the mechanical equivalent) depending upon Johnny's<br>
choice and skill level. <br>
<p>
It is in search of insectual blood! (Ichor? )<br>
<p>
Johnny ( and billy, and sammy and jimmy and maybe Janie and judy ....in their<br>
milllions across america..or perhaps the entire world ) engage the killer<br>
bee...the atrocious aphid...the boll-wevil, the corn-borer,- the<br>
mosquito...etc...in mortal combat.  And pay what the market will bear for the<br>
thrill of the chase....combat...and the kill.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile while farmer brown  no longer pays an astronomical sum to have his<br>
crops de-bugged chemically.  The enviroment no longer suffers assault from<br>
toxic concoctions.  The water supply is not threatened...The farmer pays<br>
(or...or...IS PAID a fee for having the tower on his property.<br>
<p>
Farmer Brown's fields are bug free...his crops are uneaten....his profit is<br>
larger.<br>
<p>
Millions of vicious little killers turn their attention to<br>
.......bugs......instead of each other...or vandalism.<br>
<p>
Someone...the company which provides the "droids" and the service....makes a<br>
LOT of money.<br>
