<i>&gt; Dear Extropians,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am on of you.  I am intelligent, hard working and in my deepest</i><br>
<i>&gt; yearnings an extropian to the core.  Despite this I am falling behind.  I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; dying (slowly).  Despite my best efforts at maintaining a healthy body,</i><br>
<i>&gt; quick mind, balanced diet, and adequate regiment of exercise,</i><br>
<i>&gt; anti-ozidants and smart drugs - I AM BURNING OUT.  I am hitting, like a brick</i><br>
<i>&gt; wall, the limits of my biology and psychology/neurology.  I can no longer</i><br>
<i>&gt; keep up with the demands the free-market is placing on me.  At the rate</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything is accelerating, things can only get worse for me.  I will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; lucky to be alive in 5 years - I will run out of energy far sooner.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Despite working over 50 hours per week and spending another 10 keeping</i><br>
<i>&gt; up with science &amp; technology trends, I am still falling behind</i><br>
<i>&gt; economically.  I expect the skills I have now will be obsolete by the end of 98.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I no longer have the time nor energy to gain new skills at the rate</i><br>
<i>&gt; required by today’s free-market.  I will probably be obsolete within 2</i><br>
<i>&gt; years and dead with 5 unless something very *fundamental* changes from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; free-market hell which is killing me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now this is pretty sad when I share your extropian dreams of a better</i><br>
<i>&gt; future while at the same time being increasingly being denied</i><br>
<i>&gt; opportunity from achieving them.  I am a human being and I am an extropian.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Yes. Now I see where you are coming from with your "Evolve or die!"<br>
mantra. <br>
<p>
The pace of change is great. The pace of change is increasing. The pace<br>
of change will be even greater. And yes, we will all struggle to keep up<br>
with it. We will all be spending more and more time absorbing the<br>
implications of these changes. There will come a point when the crippled<br>
brains that evolution gave us will be unable to keep up. Many would<br>
agrue that this is precisely the reason why efforts should be made to<br>
slow or at least control the pace of change.<br>
<p>
Bullshit.<br>
<p>
The pace of change is not a problem to be solved. It is a fact of life<br>
that human beings should synergize with. Yes, it does require that you<br>
evolve. But realize that you are intelligent, and you can control your<br>
own evolution to a point already. Intelligence is never obsolete. You<br>
think the problem is a free market. We don't have a free market. Your<br>
solution is to slow things down so you can catch your breath? I say<br>
speed them up so I can augment my inefficent physical form with<br>
something more capable. The future is not a hundred, fifty or even ten<br>
years down the road. You share extropian dreams of a better future?<br>
Well, to get there, we will have to watch as the world we know it is<br>
entirely turned on its head. Your inflexibility may deny you the very<br>
future you long for.             <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                 I DESERVE TO LIVE!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 I DESERVE TO THRIVE!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ...and so does every other human on this planet who wants to live and</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a better future.</i><br>
<p>
You deserve nothing. Nature owes you nothing. You are insignificant. So<br>
am I. Get this stuff out of your head. It's crippling you. You are a<br>
human being. Perhaps you don't realize this, but the birthright of every<br>
intelligent being is not life or vitality, but complexity. I would even<br>
go so far as to say that you have an obligation, in the face of known<br>
physical law, as an intelligent being to become more complex. <br>
<p>
Markets be damned. The problem is not evolution, or selfishness, or<br>
change. The problem is entropy. Don't waste your limited mental<br>
resources on disasterbation. Channel yourself into becoming more<br>
complex. Entropy is your enemy. Not me.     <br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Look, I want to evolve as much as the next person - but I should have</i><br>
<i>&gt; the right to grow at *my* pace.  Don’t you get it?  I am evolving as</i><br>
<i>&gt; fast as I can!  But the free-market (an autoevolutionary and human</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention if there ever was one - and one which almost everyone on this list</i><br>
<i>&gt; praises) doesn’t give a DAMN about *my* pace.  EITHER I ADAPT TO *ITS* PACE</i><br>
<i>&gt; OR DIE!   As the Bionomics Institute as so poignantly pointed out ‘The</i><br>
<i>&gt; free-market follows the dictates of biological evolution where the</i><br>
<i>&gt; strongest, smartest and fittest survive’(end quote).  Now if that is not a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Fascist dictate what the fuck is?!</i><br>
<p>
Yes, yes, yes! Nature is fascist! Now you've got it! Waste your energy<br>
trying to fight the facts and you will indeed be dead in five years.<br>
There may come a time when we have the potency to change the facts.<br>
Omega-point? Dyson? Who knows. Your goal is to make it that far. The<br>
tools for my survival are on their way.     <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Again, help - I want to live!  I want to live in the amazing future</i><br>
<i>&gt; that is unfolding.  Shouldn’t everyone get an *EQUAL* chance to live well</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the future?</i><br>
<p>
Everyone has an equal chance already. The smartest person in the world<br>
can still be fooled by the dumbest. The strongest can still be killed by<br>
the weakest. We are, for all practical purposes, equal. Consider the<br>
range of possibilities. How smart can we be? There is no upper bound<br>
that I know of. How far up the scale are we? Smarter than protozoa and<br>
dogs, at least. But we are the protozoa compared to the potential of<br>
posthumanity. No one has any better chance than any other. All your<br>
money, all your resources may be rendered worthless at the Singularity.<br>
We are all on equal ground. The substantial difference will be a result<br>
of how soon you realize your potential.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Otherwise aren’t extropians nazi’s - either by choice or by default?</i><br>
<p>
Quit that. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sincerely,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Holly Pearson</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Regards,<br>
