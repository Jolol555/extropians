<p>
<p>
I don't think the two are as strictly segregated as some think and I don't<br>
you need humans of even intelligence for semantics.  A sequence of amino acids<br>
MEANS a shape, the way the resulting protein folds up in water at the<br>
temperature and acidity found in life.<br>

<p>
<p>
Not a useful definition because we can't know how many relationships a <br>
system can have.<br>

No, surviving largely unchanged in the face of any environmental change, <br>
not just those produced by humans.<br>

<i>        &gt;going to be more flexible and possibly more maintainable.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I can not agree, at least not in general. If will be difficult to even <br>
understand how a complex program works and without that you can't be sure<br>
that any change you make in it won't have unexpected consequences.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Bruce Edmonds:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;Complexity . . . is unlikely to have any useful value as applied to</i><br>
<i>        &gt;"real" objects or systems.  Further that even relativising it to an</i><br>
<i>        &gt;observer has problems. It is proposed that complexity can usefully </i><br>
<i>        &gt;be applied only to constructions within a given language. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
A language doesn't need an observer, consider the Genetic code. The nucleotide <br>
triplet CAU in messenger RNA  is a "real" object it MEANS the amino acid <br>
histidine but I grant you, only in the context (language) of life, their are <br>
no special chemical characteristics that relate one to the other. One type of <br>
transfer RNA has an anticodon that connects to the CAU triplet of messenger <br>
RNA like a key fitting into a lock. At another part of the transfer RNA <br>
molecule, an amino acid can be attached, in this case histidine. However <br>
transfer RNA can't tell one amino acid from another, the amino acid <br>
attachment part is IDENTICAL in all tRNA molecules, but in practice, only <br>
those that have the anticodon for CAU are attached to histidine. The reason <br>
for this is an enzyme ( aminocyl-tRNA synthetase). <br>
<p>
This enzyme can tell one amino acid from another, and it can tell one tRNA  <br>
molecule from another, and it can a attach a animo acid to it. However, this  <br>
enzyme does NOT look at the anticodon at all but at another part of the  <br>
transfer RNA, the DHU loop. In the lab the DHU loop from one type of tRNA has <br>
been grafted onto another type of tRNA and that changes the genetic code.  <br>
It's also interesting that this enzyme is a protein encoded by, what else,  <br>
the genetic code. I can't point to exactly where the genetic code is, because  <br>
it does not reside in any one of these stages, it resides in all of them.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;A definition of complexity is proposed which can be summarised as </i><br>
<i>        &gt;"that property of a language expression which makes it difficult to </i><br>
<i>        &gt;formulate its overall behaviour even when given almost complete </i><br>
<i>        &gt;information about its atomic components and their inter-relations.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
This could be AIC or depth, I can't tell which because Edmonds doesn't<br>
say what he means by "difficult". At any rate, by this definition the<br>
gibberish produced by a monkey would certainly be more complex than any<br>
article in the journal "Nature". I want a definition that is not the opposite<br>
of our intuitive understanding of the word, I haven't found it.<br>
