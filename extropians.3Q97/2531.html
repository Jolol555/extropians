Dear fellow Extropians,<br>
<p>
After carefully reading EvMick's questionable commentaries on government<br>
and life in general I have come to the regrettable -- but constructive --<br>
conclusion that it might be in his best interest to seek competent<br>
professional assistance to help him relieve himself of his problems.   <br>
<p>
Respectfully,<br>

   "There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has
is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough
criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that
it becomes impossible to live without breaking laws."

Mr Retired Government "Civil"Servant  (my yeaaaaaars of government
service...in which..in an earlier post, he ADMITS (no shame...didn't scuff
his foot..turn his head..or NOthing when he said it.) to having
participated
in the crafting of thouands of pieces of &lt;restrictive..bydefinition&gt;
regulations....
<p>
 &gt;  I'm familiar with "Vote Scam" and numerous other books critical of one
 &gt;  aspect of government or another. When push comes to shove
<p>
To which I insert 
(the gubment is usually doing the pushing and shoving...the indian
tribes...the civil war...and little minor episodes such as Ruby Ridge and
Waco. Or how about the "viper militia" in Phoenix Az...bunch of fat ole
Viet
Viets who got their jollies by going out in desert and making
boom-boom...reliving times past when the guvment ruint their
adolescence....
they were infiltrated by "agent provactuer" of Clinton Administration  who
set 'em up....now one of them is facing jail-time. (jury folded...Judge
INSTRUCTED them to...well you figure it out...but fully informed jury...or
questions of constitutionality...or jury nullification....were
specifically
forbidden)
<p>
Mr. Civil Servant  continues:
 &gt;however, the system - with all its flaws - usually works until ignorant
ideologues
<p>
To which I reply
<p>
But I can't be an ideologue...the gubment says that I'm
"apathetic"..(along
with about 150 million others) ..and as for ignorant...it's hard to find
out
things when the  leftt-wing controlled media only selectively reports what
fits it's agenda..but I try... I knew about "Vote Scam" ,  as well as how
a
Seat for the house in Louisiana was stolen by the liberal...how Bob
Dornan's
seat, the house  of Reps from California ,was stolen by the liberal (voter
early,vote often!  We'll even fill in the ballot for you if you no savy
english)... ..and in times past how one such example in Pennsylvania was
so
odourous...so Blatant that the election was reversed...how the immigration
and naturalization scoundrels rushed thru several MILLION new
applicants...just in time for the election...never bothering to perform a
background check...which they were required to do BY Law...thus letting
thousands of felons into our country...and how LBJ managed the grave yard
votes...and how in Chicago under Mayor Daley....but you get the
picture...you
probably know more about it than I do.....from experience...first
hand....I'm
ignorant.
<p>
Mr. Civil Servant said:
&gt;with nothing better to do tear it down. 
<p>
To which I reply
<p>
You're right.. I'm a Viet Nam vet..Ten years  indentured servitude in the
Air
Force. ..six years of that overseas.. I  currently work 80-100 hrs per
week...get home to see my family maybe every other month...get half my
paycheck stolen by the government (in one of it's many
aspects..city/county/state/federal)...whose benevolent minstrations cause
everything that I buy to cost ten times what it would
otherwise...yeah...nothing better to do.
<p>
Mr. Civil Servant Continues
<p>
 &gt;  It would be nice if we spent more time trying to improve the system
 &gt;  instead of just trying to beat it to death.
<p>
To which I reply:
<p>
So what...exactly ...would constitute "improving' the system?  Voting?
Voting
is like masturbation....it feels good for a little while but has no long
term
effect.. Meek submission to the yoke?  "Yasss Massa...I be glaaaaaadd to
do
dat Massssa.!! " Evidently identification of error and abuse constitutes
"beating it to death"... 
<p>
<p>
<p>
&lt;by the way...did you read my post about the deputies  in texas  in search
of
those nasty drug lords... breaking into the wrong house...sexually abusing
the two women..psychologically abusing their daughter....we sure NEED 100,
000 more cops don't we...like the Philanderer in Chief said?&gt;
<p>
But doesn't that directly contravene the admonitions of Jefferson? 
Remember
him...dead white guy...said something about when a government got too
obnoxious that it was the DUTY of its citizenry to replace it.  (uh...him
and
his buddies felt the need to throw off the yoke of  the most powerful
government on earth at the time...for abuses FAR less and taxation FAR
less
than we currently endure today)
<p>
To which YakWax replied
 
 Wouldn't the government be perfect if we just got rid of all those
obnoxious
 citizens? &gt;&gt;
<p>
To which I add my nickel's worth.
<p>
Other governments have had that thought...Hitler(a government) got rid of
several million Jews (and other ethnic groups)...Stalin(a government) made
Hitler look like a piker..starved a whole nation to death (The
Ukraine)...Pol
Pot(a government)  killed a few million just a decade or so ago (which Mr.
Civil Servant's government vehemently denied until recently)..
<p>
In fact governments cause more death an destruction... by accident...among
their own citizenry...than the worst criminal ever DREAMT of in his most
blatant delusion of granduer...(how many did Jeffry Daumer kill?..compare
that to _  How many black men died of the Syphillis experiments? How many
unsuspecting hospital patients died in the Plutonium experiments?  How
many
innocent soldiers  near the Trinity Site at White Sands died from
radiation
induced cancer from being ordered to line up..face "thataway" and have a
nuke
blown up in their face?) 
<p>
And now with the advent of nanotechnology...and the goo hue
dilema...consider
Mr. Civil Servant's remarks...and wonder ... Do we REAAAAALLY want
nanotech
to be a government monoply?  (pick a government...any government...even a
world government)
<p>
