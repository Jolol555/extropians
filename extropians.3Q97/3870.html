<i> &gt; some specific mention of them in the mail list description for</i><br>
<i> &gt; newcomers, along with other commonly-used terms here that might</i><br>
<i> &gt; require explanation?</i><br>
<p>
(...referring to my habit of occasionally using "ey", "em",<br>
"eir", "eirs", and "eirself" as a gender-free pronoun set.)<br>
<p>
The most thorough document I've seen dealing with this question<br>
is the Gender-free Pronoun FAQ currently at<br>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.lumina.net/OLD/gfp/">http://www.lumina.net/OLD/gfp/</a><br>
<p>
Personally I shy away trying to designate an "official" usage<br>
for any group.  I use this set from time to time (not<br>
consistently) when I think I can get away with it.  I'm aware,<br>
especially on an international mailing list such as this one<br>
where not all readers are native speakers of English, that I'm<br>
risking being misunderstood, but I'm willing to take the risk.<br>
<p>
If this usage is ever going to be established as a standard,<br>
then eventually people are going to have to take the step of<br>
using them without explanation.  I don't want to go around<br>
beating people over the head with my personal taste in<br>
gender-free pronouns, so I try to do it only occasionally.<br>
<p>
I like this usage because I've noted that using "they", "them"<br>
etc. as a gender-free singular pronoun is well established in<br>
English literature (notable citations being available in the<br>
novels of Jane Austen), but I like to be clear about when I'm<br>
being explicitly singular or explicitly plural.  The "ey", "em"<br>
GFP set is directly derived from the established GFP "they",<br>
"them", but is rendered explicitly singular by dropping the<br>
initial "th" from each word.<br>
<p>
I'm sensitive to those who worship custom and tradition in linguistic<br>
usage, so I'm not directly encouraging anyone else to use these<br>
GFPs in their writing, rather I'm just trying to get away with<br>
dropping them into my own writing from time to time.<br>
