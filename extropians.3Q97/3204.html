<i>&gt;&gt;Even so, the unwarranted  reaction by Marr was surprising and disturbing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My reaction was warranted but exceptionally ill-judged, in that I should</i><br>
<i>&gt;simply have written a polite email to Paul asking him if he was aware of</i><br>
<i>&gt;his posts to the list. What saddens me most is that my ill judgement will</i><br>
<i>&gt;necessarily, and deservedly lower my standing both on this list and with</i><br>
<i>&gt;many of my dear friends.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I can only repeat the apology to Paul which I posted last night, and say</i><br>
<i>&gt;that I am considering unsubscribing from the list as the only other course</i><br>
<i>&gt;of action open to me at this time. Perhaps it is, after all, that most</i><br>
<i>&gt;human of traits, emotion, which will stop our breaking the boundaries which</i><br>
<i>&gt;limit us at this time.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
everybody makes mistakes, Sarah, and I think the list problem is being<br>
solved. I hope you feel better today. I don't know paul, but I'm sure you<br>
were forgiven as soon as you apologized.<br>
