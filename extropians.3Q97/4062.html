Dear EvMick:<br>
<p>
Your question about learning the basics tends to come up at the beginning<br>
of each semester.<br>
<p>
Obviously, there are those in each class who are more than familiar with<br>
the basics in the disciplines to be taught. There are others in some of<br>
the graduate courses who require some review, or have no experience in the<br>
theory or philosophy of the subjects under consideration.<br>
<p>
To some extent we are also concerned with the perspective (or paradigm) of<br>
the instructor. I usually try to approach a subject from multiple<br>
perspectives in the hope of broadening the minds of the students. On<br>
occasion, I'll get an older student (but never as old as me - so far) who<br>
is far more familiar with a certain aspect of a discipine than I am. When<br>
that happens, I usually ask them to submit an essay to the class on<br>
alternate perspectives with reference given to the sources -- if any.<br>
This usually provides for an interesting dialogue.       <br>
