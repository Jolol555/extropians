I<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i> &gt; Course no one would be in Control...and if you screwed up you GET</i><br>
<i> &gt; screwed...(mother nature is a bitch)..but the Fed hasn't impressed</i><br>
<i> &gt; me...seems like they cause more problems than they cure...just skew</i><br>
<i> &gt; the cause and effect relationship so NOONE knows what's going on.</i><br>
<p>
In response to my quote above you say the following.  I find I must disagree<br>
with some of what you say and will thus itemize incrementally.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;	Why would you say this?  Before we had the "Fed" controlling</i><br>
 things and things were based on "hard" money or Gold there were<br>
 periods of wild inflation when there was plenty of God and periods of.....&gt;<br>
<p>
This is called the business cycle.  The only time it really gets screwed up<br>
is when government gets involved heavily...such as when the Spainish looted<br>
the new world of it's native american (see i'm being politically correct)<br>
refined gold and carried it back to the homeland in treasure ships...this<br>
caused massive inflation to the Spanish Economy...such that some would argue<br>
that Spain never recovered.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; wild deflation when Gold became scarce.  Such wild fluctuations often</i><br>
 totally devastated the economy and was very unfair to some and gave<br>
 way to much to others arbitrarily based on the Gold supply.&gt;<br>
<p>
The early fluctuations that I beleive you are referring to were called<br>
"Panics" at the time...and although they were somewhat uncomfortable they<br>
were by no means the problem you present...to get to the Great Depression it<br>
took truly ingenious meddling by the Federal Government...as depected in<br>
works by Milton Freidman...and as I mentioned...mother nature is a<br>
bitch...she has no concept of "fair"..but her laws are inviolate...the laws<br>
of economics no less than the laws of physics.  And who gave you the divine<br>
right to judge who has too much and who has too little...Karl Marx? "From<br>
each according to his ability ...to each accroding to his need?...great<br>
system for ants and bees.<br>
<p>
<p>
 <br>
<i> &gt;	For the last 15 or so years things have been unbelievably</i><br>
 stable with a very consistent small rate of inflation, which is the<br>
 ideal.  Thanks, largely to the Fed leaders,&gt;<br>
<p>
as instituted by the Regan Administration...in the 80's<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Volker and Greenspan</i><br>
 during this time.  Of course there have been times when the Fed<br>
 screwed up, but even these times were fare better than when money was<br>
 "hard" and no one controlled it.&gt;<br>
<p>
I don't beleive this is so. As referenced abov.<br>
 <br>
<i> 	&gt;Sure money is an invention.  It's a token that represents an</i><br>
 amount of work or capital.&gt;<br>
<p>
I'm not sure i can agree entirely...by capital do you mean wealth?  Money is<br>
a store of wealth...it's great utility being that of making said wealth<br>
portable. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's value is roughly the total ammount of</i><br>
 work we can all do or our capital divided by the total amount of<br>
 dollars available. &gt;<br>
<p>
see above.  Dollars are merely a denomination...meaning some specific measure<br>
of Gold i beleive.  It's no accident that the concept of money was<br>
independently discovered many places and times and history...and they all<br>
eventually gravitated toward some scarce...but not TOO<br>
scarce..commodity...Gold proved to be ideal..rare..but not TOO<br>
rare...portable..and permanent....The VALUE of gold was a market decesion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To be fair to all, especially from one generation</i><br>
 to the next, this value should remain fairly constant or slightly<br>
 inflationary.&gt;<br>
<p>
I disagree...your..or my...concept of "fair" may be condeming future<br>
generations to poverty..early death...or horrible to contemplate...hours and<br>
hours of TV vieewing. Is it "fair' to make a whole generation dependent? Or<br>
is the incentive to work, innovate and invent more fair?  <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>  &gt;This requires some kind of control over how many</i><br>
 dollars there are, especially since the total amount of work that can<br>
 be done and the ammount of work we all want to be done in any given<br>
 year is so dynamic and growing.&gt;<br>
<p>
You assume that the morons in washington have a clue as to what is going on<br>
and that is indeed their goal.  I'm sure everyone has uncounted tales of<br>
sub-optimium situations caused and prepetuated by government idiotcy.  If the<br>
situation were subject to individual control....it would be fixed<br>
immediately...but since it must be "blessed" by some beauracy...delays and<br>
politically motivated "solutions" abound.<br>
<p>
Being in the Transportation Industry I see this every damn day...situations<br>
too numerous to enumerate.  But one example will suffice.  Size and weight<br>
limits...this has it's genesis in the Government's involvement with Rail<br>
Roads early on..To make a long story short...rather than let Free Enterprise<br>
take its course government interferred...again and again and again...further<br>
deviating the course of natural development.<br>
<p>
Now due to government meddling we have  70 foot long 80,000 pound behomonths<br>
sharing inadequate roadways at highway speeds with tiny four-wheelers...If<br>
government had not meddled the situation would be far diferent.<br>
<p>
Government is big...it rules by force.  When it makes mistakes (frequently)<br>
they are big mistakes...then it compounds the repeatedly trying to make it<br>
all better.<br>
<p>
Absent government individuals make small mistakes...They screw up...they die<br>
(perhaps...if it's a severe enough screw up)...and others learn from their<br>
mistake.  <br>
<p>
No one learns from government mistakes....least of all government...all we do<br>
is suffer.<br>
<p>
Harry Brown said something like "Government will break your leg...give you a<br>
crutch...then claim credity for providing you with the ability to walk".<br>
