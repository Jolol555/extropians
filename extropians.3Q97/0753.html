<p>
Cerebral Palsy is an interface problem. What I am referring to is the<br>
inate ability to have language at all. KoKo meets condition 1; it's<br>
problematical whether KoKo can really meet condition 2. Saying "Koko<br>
wants banana" does not meet condition 2. "Koko feel angry" is on the<br>
edge. "Koko thinks Koko angry" probably meets condition 2. I don't know<br>
if Koko ever said something whose topic is self reference.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hobbes (?) would agree that the use of language is what separates man</i><br>
<i>&gt; from animal. I don't think he went so far as to say it is what makes us</i><br>
<i>&gt; conscious.</i><br>
<p>
That's why condition 2.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As far as the second criteria, I agree that self-awareness is necessary</i><br>
<i>&gt; to consciousness, indeed I think it is the definition of consciousness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Go back and read condition 2. Self awareness by itself, without means of<br>
communication, is not consciousness as defined above. My computer here<br>
as I write this posting may be self-aware, but I have no way of<br>
accessing this. The point is to create an operational definition which<br>
can be subjected to experimental testing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In order to be self-aware, a system must have two things 1) will and 2)</i><br>
<i>&gt; power.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Will is the ability to self-direct (L. volo) according to one's own</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-interest.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Power is the abilitiy to warp (L. inflecto) the normal course of events.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If something exists it by definition must have a certain measure of</i><br>
<i>&gt; power.</i><br>
<p>
I believe a cruise missile meets your definition quite nicely. Will<br>
drives it to its target. Exploding empowers it. Many religions state<br>
attainment of Heaven as the ultimate self interested goal, so I guess it<br>
will have to be a cruise missle from Iraq.... :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So a system is self-aware if it can discuss its experiences? I think the</i><br>
<i>&gt; more distilled version of this is if a system can understand and use the</i><br>
<i>&gt; first person singular. I think, I feel, I did, I was, etc.</i><br>
<p>
No... go read it again. It has to discuss its awareness of its<br>
existence. Per your definition, even little Sojourner is arguably<br>
self-aware. Is reporting sensory experience self awareness??<br>
