This is one step above the physical transport layer. Upon it, you can <br>
mount a DNS-like abstraction.  However, I simply don't like global <br>
distributed databases. Machines don't need syntactic sugar, anyway.<br>

A solution: you leave a message stream reflector in your home (sweet <br>
home) node, you leave a trail of forwarding agents as you travel. When <br>
two agents discover they communicate via a relais, they snap the pointer, <br>
and start communicating directly. When you move, you report your new cell <br>
address to the last agent. _Very_ limited flooding (just few bits of the <br>
binary ID) should catch you even at Mach 5.<br>
<p>
If you move permanently, you give notification to all relevant parties, <br>
so that the bulk gets redirected to your new location. A bounce agent <br>
left in place will forward you the rest, while also notifying the senders <br>
about your address change.<br>
<p>
There's a million of ways to make this practicable. The chiefest reason <br>
is that you don't need routing anymore, switches (which are vastly simpler <br>
and dumber) are sufficient. So let's chuck out TCP/IP.<br>
