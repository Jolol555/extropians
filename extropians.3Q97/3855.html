Ka-Ping Yee quotes:<br>
<i> &gt;   "A libertarian is a person who believes that no one has the right,</i><br>
<i> &gt;   under any circumstances, to initiate force against another human</i><br>
<i> &gt;   being, or to advocate or delegate its initiation. Those who act</i><br>
<i> &gt;   consistently with this principle are libertarians, whether they</i><br>
<i> &gt;   realize it or not. Those who fail to act consistently with it are</i><br>
<i> &gt;   not libertarians, regardless of what they may claim."</i><br>
<p>
and then writes:<br>
<i> &gt; This is an interesting and somewhat curious definition.  According </i><br>
<i> &gt; to the above it would seem that any person who applied force to stop</i><br>
<i> &gt; the rape or murder of someone they loved would not be libertarian.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Thus, for example, i fail this qualification in my current state.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Is this the intent of "libertarianism"?  I seek to improve my</i><br>
<i> &gt; understanding.  Thanks,</i><br>
<p>
<p>
"initiate" is a big shibboleth in the libertarian ethical<br>
theology.  The standard response to your objection is that<br>
applying force to prevent a rape or murder is not initiation of<br>
force, but self-defense.  The "initiation of force" in question <br>
was in the actions of the would-be rapist or murderer, not the<br>
actions of the defender.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, this maneuver takes us right into the well-known<br>
schoolyard phenomenon of "He started it!" "No, he did!" in less<br>
drastic situations, and less drastic ethical situations are very<br>
common and pesky in real life.<br>
<p>
One question that I've spent some time thinking about is "How<br>
can one reliably distinguish between an act of self-defense<br>
and a pre-emptive strike?"<br>
