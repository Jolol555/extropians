Extropians,<br>
<p>
	Everyone's familiar with the Noah story right?  The one where<br>
Noah tries to warn everyone about the impending, yet avoidable doom,<br>
trying to get everyone to help build arks so that they might survive<br>
the flood.  But, unfortunately, no one listens to him, (for what<br>
reasons?) and he and his family, along with the animals he has<br>
collected, are the only ones that survive.  I was in a Lutheran Church<br>
last Saturday (for a friend's wedding) and I noticed a brightly<br>
colored (with rainbow) picture of the inhabitants of the ark coming<br>
forth upon the finally dry (and cleansed?) land.  It was a large mural<br>
covering an entire wall in the children's nursery.  It's probably a<br>
good thing I resisted the temptation to add a few dead and rotting<br>
bodily remains with an ink marker, that surely would have been left<br>
over from what, if it really occured, was one of the most devastating<br>
and destructive catastrophes during the history of mankind.<br>
<p>
	But anyway, I wondered what the chance will be that, maybe<br>
1000 years from now and more, one of the stories we all tell our<br>
children (and make children's toys about and paint colorful depictions<br>
of on the walls of nurseries...), is how Robert Ettinger, and others,<br>
tried to warn and convince the world of the doom they could have<br>
avoided by simply taking proper actions.  The story would be very<br>
similar in that only a relative hand full of people would heed his<br>
warning and would make the eternal life saving effort, mostly because<br>
of ancient religious ideas contained in stories like that of Noah and<br>
the flood...  I can imagine toy dewers with little dolls representing<br>
people and their pets nicely fitting inside...  (and cheesy animated<br>
videos...?  Nahh!)  Obviously, some of the actual survivors will be on<br>
hand to retell the story first hand, giving it infinite more<br>
significance, as compared to Noah who is, if he was more than a cheesy<br>
animated character, long dead and gone.<br>
<p>
	Religion seems so completely ironic to me, as a cryonaut, in<br>
so many never ending ways.  Wouldn't it be humorous if it wasn't so<br>
tragic?<br>
