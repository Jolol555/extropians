That's a shame.  Still, I think his ideas will probably have a life of<br>
their own, and lead on to other, better ones.  Another point I forgot to<br>
mention, which was the main reason I read Food of the Gods at the time,<br>
was how his theory ties in so neatly with Riane Eisler's (Chalice and<br>
the Blade), about how early human civilisations (round about early<br>
Jericho, Mohenjo Daro, etc.) were kind of 'nice', with equality between<br>
the sexes and stuff, but unfortunately got invaded by several successive<br>
waves of hard bastards from tougher climes, who introduced all the<br>
unfortunate trappings of what she calls 'dominator' culture - IOW<br>
'patriarchy', heirarchy, etc.<br>
<p>
That's another theory which, in its raw state is probably too neat to be<br>
true (I've read some interesting criticisms of Eisler/Gimbutas by<br>
Marxist feminist critics), but has a certain degree of plausibility.<br>
