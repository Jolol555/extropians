<p>
Calm down, Kennita....<br>
<p>
In the context I intend, the opposite of praise is not insult, but<br>
criticism.  (By the same token, I think the opposite of insult<br>
would be flattery.)  "Your house is a mess, Lee." sounds to me like<br>
criticism.  Insult would sound more like "You're a worthless slob,<br>
Lee.".<br>
<p>
Also, speaking for myself, I'd take such a statement much better from<br>
a friend than from someone who didn't know me well.  I've known my<br>
friend Valerie for fifteen years; I can tell her what a disaster her<br>
house is with impunity now.  (**Note that I also make a point to tell<br>
her how nice it looks when she cleans up!**)  And even after all these<br>
years I don't insult her by saying something like "you're really rude<br>
to keep your house like this and expect people to come over".  If I<br>
felt that way, I just wouldn't come over (read, I'd press Delete).<br>
<p>
Actually, I like the housekeeping analogy, so I'll stick with it for<br>
a while -- if anybody requires a translation, let me know....<br>
<p>
I wouldn't tell someone I liked their housekeeping if I didn't -- that<br>
would be flattery (as I see it).  However, I would be very politic in<br>
how I approached the issue of housekeeping with a stranger, if I felt<br>
it was necessary to approach it at all, and if I felt that I could do<br>
some good rather than just spouting my feelings, which often turns out<br>
to be counterproductive.  Personally, I'd probably start with something<br>
safe on the fringes, like "I bet you've been pretty busy, huh?".  This<br>
would allow me to gauge the response from a relatively safe distance:<br>
Possible responses could include "Yeah, sorry about the mess.", or "Yeah,<br>
[unrelated topic indicating that the person is unaware of or doesn't care<br>
about the mess].", or "If you don't like the mess, you can lump it!", or<br>
"No, I just haven't been able to get moving lately.".  There are others,<br>
of course....<br>
<p>
Each response would give me a different understanding of the reasons<br>
behind the messy house, helping me to decide over time whether I would<br>
prefer to help clean up (there are a number of ways to do this,<br>
certainly), to ignore the mess, or to stay away.<br>
<p>
Enough analogy for now....<br>
<p>
I see an insult as a form of attack.  Attack tends to provoke either<br>
entrenchment or counterattack or both.  Since I don't like being<br>
surrounded by bunkers or bristling weapons, I tend to avoid attack,<br>
and to discourage it.  To a first approximation, I think a fact becomes<br>
an attack when it gets personal.  "You are rude.", "You are ignorant.",<br>
"You deserve insults." are all personal, and in my estimation all attacks<br>
-- changing "you" to "he" doesn't change that.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
