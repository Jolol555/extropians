This brings to mind an interesting thought.  Years ago I worked in the<br>
parallel processing business doing operating system design.  The advantage<br>
of parallel processing is of course that you have a lot of processers working<br>
on the problem.  The disadvantage is that sometimes processors have to<br>
wait for work to be communicated from other processors before they can<br>
proceed.  With certain kinds of simulations, you may not necessarily know<br>
whether information is going to come from the other processors or not in<br>
a time frame which will influence what this processor is doing.  The usual<br>
solution is to establish a global clock and make all processors run<br>
synchronously, so that they don't go on to time t+1 until everybody has<br>
done all the work for time t.<br>
<p>
There was a research project on the "Time Warp OS".  In this system, each<br>
processor plowed ahead without waiting to see whether other processors<br>
were going to send messages.  Basically it assumed that there were not<br>
going to be messages from the other processors, and it did the local<br>
simulation on that basis.  If a message then arrived which should have<br>
been processed in the past, the local OS rolled the processor state<br>
back to what it had been at the time that message needed to get handled.<br>
It then handled the message and proceeded forward.  Most of the technical<br>
work in the OS was to have efficient ways to checkpoint and roll back<br>
in this way.<br>
<p>
You could envision a neural simulation on a Time Warp machine.  It would<br>
assume some default pattern of incoming impulses into the part of the<br>
brain being simulated by some processor.  Then, if the actual data which<br>
arrived was different from what had been assumed, it would roll back its<br>
state and handle the data as needed.  If it turned out that the default<br>
model for incoming data was reasonable accurate much of the time, this<br>
could be a very efficient way to simulate the brain on a network.<br>
<p>
The interesting question this raises is whether there would be any<br>
conscious perception by the simulated brain of the "paths not taken".<br>
Frequently, part of the brain moves forward in time assuming some<br>
pattern of outside impulses, only to find out that the actual pattern<br>
was different from what was assumed, so that it resets its state to what<br>
it was in the past and proceeds forward to process the actual data.  So<br>
there are transient brain states being computed which do not correspond<br>
to the actual brain states which the simulation eventually produces.<br>
<p>
We assume that the (simulated) neural activity is what gives rise to<br>
consciousness.  Therefore it might be that the simulated "wrong" neural<br>
activity could give rise to a consciousness which does not match the<br>
"true" consciousness being determined by the simulation.  This false<br>
consciousness would have no way of interacting with the outside world, or<br>
of revealing its existence through any overt behavior.  The person being<br>
simulated would steadfastly deny that he had any unusual perceptions<br>
or sensations due to the time warp simulation (because all the false<br>
ones would get rolled back and erased).  Yet we have reason to think<br>
that he is wrong, by the principle which identifies mental states with<br>
(simulated) brain states.<br>
<p>
This could be thought of as a case where behavior cannot reveal certain<br>
mental attributes.<br>
