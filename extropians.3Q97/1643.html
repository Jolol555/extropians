<i>&gt; &gt;2. Why don't you ASK some Blacks what they think of all this. Kennita,</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

Dear Kennita,<br>
<p>
Don't know if you read my complete exposition. But as a <br>
scientist, (although specialized, having a strong generallist <br>
characteristic - almost ecological, since the environmental phenomena <br>
may be treated using other points of view... although not always so <br>
clean or precise...)   I simply *know* that lots of my black <br>
friends (and not only in Brazil...) would love a lot to change their <br>
external appearance (and lots of them  will just admit when it will <br>
be disposable for them... if not, or will have any psychological <br>
problem to be solved or will be influenced by any of the memes like <br>
religion, communism, etc., or will have no money to get the <br>
treatment, in a first moment...). It is just an individual option, <br>
that they  do not have yet.... And... if it depend*ed* on just the <br>
"smart" racists, they would never get it...<br>
<p>
Friendly Hugs,<br>
<p>
Gomes<br>

PS: Bellow is again my complete message, with a *little comment* :<br>

<i>&gt; I'll make worse. For going deeper with the scientific conclusions, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; prefer to go straight to the points, so the intellectual selection</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be done...As a matter of fact, we are talking in the teacher's</i><br>
<i>&gt; room, and not at the school yard, nor at high school, and not even</i><br>
<i>&gt; just bachelorate level... (although eventual true intelectuals are</i><br>
<i>&gt; always welcome, independently on their academic education...) Let's</i><br>
<i>&gt; go:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Indeed, as a  scientist I know that studying the reallity of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; facts is much better than working in illusion. Even if we want to</i><br>
<i>&gt; give another option to the other... For example, I repeat that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; psychological external factor is important and lots of blacks will</i><br>
  <br>
           <br>
******* I said  "lots of" and not "all". Indeed, If someth happens to <br>
me that would change my external appearance, or even the science <br>
would discover a treatment that would make me feel much better <br>
externally -  like the recent discovery of the white hair gene... of <br>
course I will use a treatment to keep (make) my hair, or skin, or <br>
anything (hehehe) much better,  when I get old or not- when we feel <br>
good internally, we "may" better (and freely) treat the external too  <br>
(and, I repeat, I consider the process something recursive...). <br>
(Anyway, I am free of religious memes, like the christians that <br>
consider that "suffering like Jesus did..." tchan!.. (poor <br>
good-intentioned boy...but certainly there were worse suffers...- <br>
for the sados..) will buy them a stairway to heaven (sorry dear Page <br>
and other Zeps, for the mix (hehehe)...). If you have been following <br>
the discussions, have noticed that we, the most free, less <br>
preconceptous and advanced minds on the list, are foreseeing even <br>
the substitution of the *whole brain* ... and you do no think it <br>
wouldn't be improved, dont you? (obviously keeping the <br>
individualities...) Now, when after all this,  we simply read racist <br>
or preconceptual confused interpretations, you can imagine how <br>
"angry" we get... ( If it weren't the market/commercial reasons (do <br>
not kill yourselves, those who still are innocent poor <br>
babies...hehehe) I'd say simply: yes, keep on being as you want (not <br>
personal, just general...) just do not perturb! (of course I'd also <br>
think: must be crazy...) <br>
<p>
********<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; love more themselves and to living  when they can make genetical</i><br>
<i>&gt; skin-hair-eyes treatment...They already try to strenght their</i><br>
<i>&gt; hair... </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2)About the "cultural treatment", untill I have perceived, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "median" whites will like more to providing it when "pacients" will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be white too.. ( that is not the ideal, but being very rigid,</i><br>
<i>&gt; waiting just for the "conversion" of all to the "perfect heavenly</i><br>
<i>&gt; good", seeing the "brother" as an equal, blablabla, has already been</i><br>
<i>&gt; shown as not very efficient... from both sides...There is necessity</i><br>
<i>&gt; of real acts...) Naked truth: Help a black to feel better: Make it</i><br>
<i>&gt; white... (And we know they will like it...Michael Jackson is</i><br>
<i>&gt; right...See a picture of him before and after...and his success) (</i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems a little joke but, ev'ry body knows, f.ex., that Jesus was</i><br>
<i>&gt; a hebrew and, very very possibly, black haired, and not so white</i><br>
<i>&gt; skinned. Even though, the first european painters of  "sacred art"</i><br>
<i>&gt; made lots of pictures of a blond-haired, blue-eyed Jesus...and Mary,</i><br>
<i>&gt; angels, etc...why? Projected on the "Perfect" their notions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; perfectness... )</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2)Ask, for ex ., a black woman if she wouldn't love to change her</i><br>
<i>&gt; external characteristics. I said woman, since women have dedicated</i><br>
<i>&gt; more their mind development, in media, associated to external</i><br>
<i>&gt; factors, because of the "Machist" Natural Selection and also because</i><br>
<i>&gt; they generally think a lot (just) in "grow up and marry", instead of</i><br>
<i>&gt; working and earning their money for suviving *for themselves* - by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the way it is much more interesting and... workless... isn't it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; With some exceptions, of course... </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; PS: Sorry and not for the girls. But the human has added an </i><br>
<i>&gt; important tool for its evolution: the conciousness of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; reality... The question for you is: Is this good or better?  Really</i><br>
<i>&gt; wanna see your answers... And evolutive seriousness... Do not forget</i><br>
<i>&gt; we're here not just "Playing God...", but...being better than such</i><br>
<i>&gt; image !...</i><br>
