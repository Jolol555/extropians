<p>
&lt;&lt; Didn't someone post some research results to the list a year or two ago<br>
 showing that children who spend time with adults generally do better than<br>
 those who spend their time with other kids? This wouldn't seem terribly<br>
 surprising, since adults tend to know a lot more than kids. Worked for me,<br>
 anyway.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
Now there's a thought...why is it important for kids to learn to deal with<br>
kids AS kids?  Shortly they will no longer BE kids...a useless skill...better<br>
to jumpstart learning the skills necessary to deal with adults...a lifelong<br>
skill requirement. Or deal with kids from the adult perspective...parenting.<br>
<p>
Thus falls the myth that Home Schooled kids need to interact with others of<br>
their age group.  Better to be helping out in the family business.<br>
<p>
Say!  Don't certain despised minority groups do that very thing? (despised<br>
because of their great success by the LESS successful).<br>
<p>
I'm not sure society is ready for such a concept.  No juvenile<br>
gangs....vandalism..juvenile delenquency...public schools..<br>
<p>
Just look at how many people stand to loose their jobs!!! (Cops..Social<br>
Workers...almost the entirety of the "education" hierarchy...The biggest part<br>
of the Judicial System...the prison system...myriads of support personnel<br>
needed to administrate the vast beauracy ...the IRS.....the mind boggles.<br>
<p>
Best just be quiet about the matter....and pack little Johnny away to<br>
daycare..then kindegarten...then elementary school...then Jr. Hi....then High<br>
School...you can see him on the weekends...secure in the knowledge that<br>
civilization as we know it has been saved.  <br>
