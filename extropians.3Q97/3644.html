Hello All,<br>
<p>
Referring to Arjans "&gt;H is spreading….." , last weekend<br>
When we were forming  EXCEDO (the Dutch &gt;H group )<br>
Dalibor and I had a very lengthy discussion regarding copy and<br>
original.<br>
<p>
Dalibor: if I quote you wrong please correct!<br>
<p>
Anyway the case was:<br>
<p>
If you make an exact (very important word) copy of an<br>
original person, will it be the same, or will the original<br>
know it is the original and the copy know it is the copy!<br>
<p>
<p>
I claim that this is related to time!<br>
<p>
So: if you copy a person " PERFECT" when everything (atoms) <br>
Is put on a hold. I mean a complete "standstill" The copy<br>
Will not know that he/she is the copy. They can however<br>
go different directions. (Like twins). And when they meet<br>
They start discussing who is who!<br>
<p>
Dalibor claimed the original will always know he is the<br>
original. I claimed that he then, still is thinking of<br>
one original "spirit"<br>
<p>
To give you one example of my opinion: <br>
I freeze a person.<br>
When he is in cryo-suspension.<br>
I put all relevant data in a computer, destroy the<br>
original. Build a new one, and wake him<br>
He will claim, he is the one who went into <br>
The Cryo-suspension.<br>
There is no way this person, will have a memory,<br>
That tells him he has been copied, since I gave<br>
Him the exact brain-pattern where he started with.<br>
<p>
If you copy one alive though (living in time)<br>
He'll know when he's been copied, therefore<br>
It will become a part of his memory, and that's<br>
Why he can tell he is the copy or the original.<br>
<p>
Anyone an opinion.<br>
<p>
<p>
Greetings,<br>
<p>
Berrie<br>
