<p>
As a parasitic growth on Greek culture.  It's well-known that<br>
throughout the imperial period, the Roman armies were accompanied<br>
by Greek engineers and scientists (very early on, Archimedes gave<br>
the Romans a first-hand lesson in the military power of good<br>
engineering). From the historical perspective of, say, Eastern<br>
Europeans, the "real" Roman empire ended up being reabsorbed by<br>
Greece: the Eastern Empire outlived the Western Empire by a millenium,<br>
and its fall was as much due to the Crusaders (who sacked Constantinople<br>
and burned the libraries) as to the later Turks.<br>
<p>
Which begs the question: how did it happen that the Greeks were<br>
the first to leave us surviving extensive theoretical writings on<br>
astronomy, mathematics, political theory, rhetoric, logic, etc,<br>
etc, etc?  How did it happen that the Greeks discovered and developed<br>
the idea of logical rigor?  Like the early modern Europe that Dale<br>
was discussing, Greece was politically divided, resistant to<br>
unification, and constantly obsessed with the internal military-political<br>
balance of power.  Persistent pluralism is a fact of Greek political<br>
life from its first emergence from the Dorian Dark Ages until the<br>
Roman conquest (Alexander's successors, the Antigonids, controlled<br>
Macedonia, but barely kept the various "true" Greeks in line).<br>
<p>
Greek tradition credits the Greek sages and philosophers.  Most of<br>
the Greek sages and philosophers trace their lineage back to one<br>
Thales of Miletus, who is probably at least partly historical, but<br>
might be largely legendary.  It's always been interesting to me<br>
that Thales was active among the Greeks about the same time that<br>
Zoroaster was active in Persia, that Lao Tzu and Confucius were<br>
active in China, and that Siddhartha Gautama was active in India.<br>
It's almost as if there were some sort of pan-Eurasian philosophical<br>
renaissance going on in the fifth century BCE.<br>
<p>
How did the Greeks get so cool?  I dunno.  I suspect the alphabet<br>
may have something to do with it.  The alphabet was invented in or<br>
near Palestine or Phoenicia during the Greek Dark Ages, and the<br>
Greeks were one of the first non-Canaanite peoples to pick it up.<br>
(Why didn't the Canaanites take off?  Well, the Canaanites were<br>
more caught up in southwest Eurasian imperial wars and politics<br>
than the Greeks, and the successor people that defeated and absorbed<br>
the Canaanites -- the Hebrews -- turned out to be hugely influential<br>
in their own way as well.) I suspect that it is easier for more<br>
people to attain literacy in a society that uses an alphabetic<br>
system of writing than it is in a society that uses the more complex<br>
hieroglyphic or cuneiform systems.  At the time of the emergence<br>
of Greek civilization, the hieroglyhpic and cuneiform systems had<br>
both become extremely complex, full of special cases and weird<br>
traditions that make English spelling look sane, and guarded by an<br>
elaborate trade union of scribes who didn't welcome any competition<br>
that might drive their compensation down.  The Greeks didn't have<br>
these problems.  I also happen to think that a lot of European<br>
"supremacy" is due to the combination of the alphabet with movable<br>
type (movable type doesn't make a huge economic difference in an<br>
ideographic writing system, but it makes books *hugely* cheaper<br>
under an alphabetic system).  So a lot of this stuff might be due<br>
to accidents in the development of communications technology.<br>
<p>
That a lot of people hold theories like these somewhere in the back<br>
of their minds explains some of the near-messianic fervor people<br>
often experience soon after they first start learning how to use<br>
the Internet effectively for research and communication.<br>
