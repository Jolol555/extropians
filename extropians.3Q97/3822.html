<i>&gt;&gt; from Mouse Monitor, sept. 1997 by Robert E. Bauman:    "The US Treasury</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) on May 21, in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; little-noticed rule proposal, began the government's take-over of all forms</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of electronic and digital cash in America.  For the first time the US</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; government asserted direct control over all so-called financial "stored</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; value systems," defined as "...funds or monetary value represented in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; digital format (whether or not encrypted) and stored, or capable of storage,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; on electronic media...as to be retrievable and transferable electronically."</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; (Official text at <a href="http://www.moneylaundering.com">http://www.moneylaundering.com</a> ) This definition covers</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; so-called "smart cards", online Internet banking and any other cash</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; transactions in electronic form."</i><br>
<p>
Actually, in thinking about the above rule proposal definition, a<br>
(electronic) barter system with, presumably, 'things' (like onions, shoes or<br>
software etc.) being represented in the system as Information Packets (or<br>
Contracts), the "...funds or monetary value..." could perhaps be<br>
circumvented (as inapplicable), no?  Anyway, the keys (for me) are : <br>
Private Network based<br>
Globally Decentralised (operation/administration/participation?)<br>
Totally Encrypted Transactions<br>
Anonymous participation (if possible and, eventually, even if necessary)<br>
Strictly Contractual Transactions (with electronic escrow account for<br>
protection OR some sort of Ostracism Matrix for Contract defaulters -- to<br>
insure/assure honesty)<br>
Other things that I haven't thought of yet! :o)<br>
<p>
Incidentally, Eliezer (or anyone else), have you considered the possibility<br>
of going beyond barter, or complex-barter, to the source of 'value'<br>
(including things) which I conjecture is, fundamentally, energy?  That is to<br>
say, a person is alive *because* of the energy coursing through him or her,<br>
and thier expression of that energy being thoughts (articulated) and things<br>
produced.  I'm talking about the possibility of basing 'value' on a<br>
quantifiable accumulation of energy units someone can generate.  In such a<br>
system (were one possible) everyone participating would be assured, at<br>
least, survival (with a kind of Love Fund for those physically/mentally<br>
challenged) and eventually, with an integration of new<br>
information/technology used with a participants directed energy, they could<br>
acquire anything they wanted (from other participants only, I guess).  Well,<br>
tell me I'm crazy!  It's just an idea!  Something to think about...........<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Am I glad it's not the U.N. doing this!  Well, either the attempt will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;ill-fated and abandoned, or the system will get started in a country outside</i><br>
<i>&gt;the U.S.A.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe, indirectly, it IS the U.N.(or the energy/banking-guys-and-gals behind<br>
the U.N.!) Pulling the strings of the puppet US Government.  I believe it's<br>
another step in a global totalitarian plan, and it's already started in the<br>
u.s.a.!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm starting to get annoyed by this encryption business.  Do you suppose that</i><br>
<i>&gt;if, say, 10 million people sent copies of 128-bit RSA code overseas as an act</i><br>
<i>&gt;of protest, they'd give it up?  You could use electronically coordinated civil</i><br>
<i>&gt;disobedience with registered snowball cooperation.</i><br>
<p>
I reckon that 10 million people USING 128-bit encryption would be a start.<br>
Don't bank on anyone in (perceived) power of giving ANYTHING up (especially<br>
control of all *those* sheep!)  I like the "..registered snowball<br>
cooperation." though. :o)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I'm all for your system (or something like it) myself, and I would be very</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; interested to hear about how you are going to implement it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well... the obvious, electronic way, I suppose.  Once all digital 'cash'</i><br>
<i>&gt;shifts to the Internet and digital contracts (even automatically generated</i><br>
<i>&gt;ones) are freely enforceable, then making the software available might simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;be enough.  First a few corporations would use it for simple barter, then the</i><br>
<i>&gt;some people would use it for complex barter, and before you know it, the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt;economy would have shifted over.</i><br>
<p>
As I understand it, all digital 'cash' already is on the Internet, isn't it?<br>
One of the keys (add this to the list above) is either Coca-Cola-type<br>
AWARENESS of the issues this thread is about (conscious commerce?), and/or<br>
an extremely, irresistably magnetic system to attract punters away from<br>
(what I believe is) the current, coercive predatory-economic system.<br>
