Kennita Watson:<br>
<i>&gt;as a greater sense of well-being.  Adding DHEA (for me) also helped.</i><br>
<p>
I think that the topic of depression can be an important one for questing, <br>
hyper-intelligent, growth oriented individuals who can sometimes feel <br>
stymied by their environments, and I thank you for your openness in <br>
discussing your meds program.  I have a question:  Does the DHEA help <br>
the antidepressants work better, or are its effects related more to your <br>
general health?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I started taking them not because I was severely depressed, but because</i><br>
<i>&gt;I felt my mind wasn't working as well as I thought it should.</i><br>
<p>
I wish you could have been in on Anders' and my brief conversation<br>
at the conference regarding mental function and antidepressants, and <br>
I hope that you or others will provide some input now.  The story in<br>
brief:  As a young, questioning, somewhat rebellious woman growing <br>
up in the deep south, and, yes, experiencing occasional depression, I <br>
was put under the care of a physician who put me on every existing <br>
neurotransmitter drug, sometimes two or three at a time, for several <br>
years.  (These drugs are not used anymore, considered too crude and <br>
dangereous with the development of the SSIs.)  <br>
<p>
The negative results:  reduced ability to memorize concrete data, and <br>
periods of reduced focus, serious damage to my immune system.  <br>
The positive results:  acquired ability to parallel process, greater <br>
speed in processing input, occasional intense 'brain burn' breakthroughs <br>
in conceptual thought. <br>
<p>
What I am trying to figure out, and am open to serious suggestions on, <br>
is how to retain the positive aspects while improving the negative.  My <br>
goals:  increased focus and greater ability to memorize concrete data. <br>
The one nootropic expert I spoke to suggested that I was forced into the <br>
effects of nootropics too fast and should hold off on trying them.  Most <br>
of the literature surrounding nootropics seems to concentrate on <br>
'speeding up' the thought process, whereas I am more interested in <br>
'refining'.  And I certainly don't recommend anyone dumping these <br>
neuro drugs into their systems, because the physical effects are <br>
simply not worth the mental effects--it nearly killed me and it took <br>
years to clean out.  But I am open to suggestions here!<br>
