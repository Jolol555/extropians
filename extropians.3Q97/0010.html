<i>&gt; Subject: POLI: Hooray for the 10th Amendment</i><br>
<i>&gt; Date: Monday, June 30, 1997 3:07 PM</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Michael Lorrey stated in part:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Concluding their 1997 term, the Supreme Court Justices ruled 5-4 in</i><br>
<i>&gt; favor of states rights proponents and against the Federal Brady Law.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They ruled that federal law cannot commandeer the resources and time of</i><br>
<i>&gt; state officials without compensation to administer the requirements of</i><br>
<i>&gt; federal regulation. It is a usurpation of states 10th Amendment rights.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dear Fellow Extropians:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's usually a mistake to refer to any written decision of any appellate</i><br>
<i>&gt; court (particularly the U.S. Supreme Court) without examining every nuance</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the court's language.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In this particular instance, the court ruled (only in part) that duties</i><br>
<i>&gt; cannot be imposed upon the states without due and appropriate</i><br>
<i>&gt; compensation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is my understanding that the two or three rural sheriffs who brought</i><br>
<i>&gt; this action were primarily funded in their initial litigation and appeals</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the National Rifle Association. I think that most of us can understand</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the leadership of the NRA</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be quite interested in supporting such an action.</i><br>
<p>
Especially when the ACLU, which is self charged with defending our<br>
constitutional rights (supposedly all of them), refuses to come to the<br>
aid of people whose 2nd amendment rights have been violated. They also<br>
refused to involve themselves in this case, even though it was not a 2nd<br>
amendment case, because it involved guns... talk about liberal<br>
hipocrisy....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The claim that many people are being improperly denied the right to bear</i><br>
<i>&gt; arms seems more than slightly specious.</i><br>
<p>
Hardly, when 60,000 people are wrongly denied access to guns, and only 7<br>
people are prosecuted for attempted purchase? Specious? <br>
<p>
 The high court has ruled on this<br>
<i>&gt; issue as well in great detail. They have concluded that the right to bear</i><br>
<i>&gt; arms is not absolute and can be regulated by the Federal government, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; States and and political subdivisions thereof.</i><br>
<p>
There is a vast difference between regulating, and denying. They did not<br>
include this in their decision , BTW, because they have recognised that<br>
the 2nd amendment only applies to the regulation of the militia, not the<br>
regulation of firearms. Where congress gets off with assault weapons<br>
bans, etc. is in the interstate commerce clause.... Get your<br>
Constitution straight...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The need for firearms in our society seem questionable as well in many</i><br>
<i>&gt; instances.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The arguements as to the need for self-defense against predators in our</i><br>
<i>&gt; society is best answered by having professionally trained law enforcement</i><br>
<i>&gt; officials in each community.</i><br>
<p>
Hardly, they are only there to catch the guy AFTER he has killed and<br>
raped your family....That in is not self defense, it is law enforcement.<br>
There is a big difference. Self defense is also recognised by the<br>
supreme court as a 9th and 10th amendment right.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm a bit dubious as to the need of hunters for many of the rapid fire</i><br>
<i>&gt; arms that are readily available as well as the need for handguns. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; collected cumulitive evidence indicates that most people who claim they</i><br>
<i>&gt; need a handgun for self defense are usually incapable of using one under</i><br>
<i>&gt; siuations of stress. They frequently end up shooting other family members</i><br>
<i>&gt; or themselves.</i><br>
<p>
Hardly, the most recent review of accident rates by the National Safety<br>
Board shows that not only is the accident rate from firearms at its all<br>
time historical low of .06 per 100,000 population (from a peak in 1904<br>
of 3.4), but that this rate is lower than the accident rate in<br>
automobiles, commuter and private aircraft, and even sitting on your own<br>
toilet.... Don't be a vitcim of propaganda, get the facts first.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's possible that the issue of paranoia in our society is entering the</i><br>
<i>&gt; minds of some of you, as well as the numerous psycho-sexual implications</i><br>
<i>&gt; of gun collecting, so I'll let this issue ride while you digest and</i><br>
<i>&gt; consider the bigger picture.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For those who are sceptical about my motives. Yes, I am an occasional</i><br>
<i>&gt; casual hunter. Yes, I use a single shot shotgun or a compound bow when I</i><br>
<i>&gt; hunt. Yes, I've had to use deadly weapons in the distant past. No, I did</i><br>
<i>&gt; not enjoy having to use them. The circumstances under which I was required</i><br>
<i>&gt; to use weapons I'll leave to your fertile imaginings.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A.M. Genen</i><br>
<p>
So you admit you have a neurotic aversion to guns, which you refuse to<br>
have treated?<br>
