Speaking to a  retired Guv.  (ahem) employee<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; See, the trouble with your position is this.  The money you use to do<br>
  your thing has been taken from people.  (In the best possible cases) the<br>
 thing you've done seems to have had some visible benefit; but what is<br>
 invisible is the other stuff people could have done with the money you<br>
 took off them in taxes.  Think about it. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
&lt;breaking in rudely&gt;<br>
<p>
I've thought about it.  I do think about it... I am thinking aboutl it...a<br>
lot.<br>
<p>
The guv. takes over %50 percent of my income.<br>
The guv.  restricts entry into busines by regulation.<br>
The guv thereby chokes off new jobs and increases the cost of living.<br>
<p>
At a minimium, were there no guv. meddling, I would have a minimium of four<br>
times the disposable income that I now have......I "guesstimate" that it<br>
would in reality be closer to ten times.<br>
<p>
The reasoning follows.  The industry in the US (world) which has the least<br>
amount of  Guv. meddling is the computer industry.  Ref: Moores law...You get<br>
Twice the computer for half the money every 18 months.  I take that to be the<br>
NORMAL course of events absent guv meddling.<br>
<p>
It is the birthright of everyone to acheive millionaire (billionaire) status<br>
by middle age...given a free economy.The guv ...by meddling ...is stealing<br>
our birthright and only a few manage to acheive it.<br>
<p>
<p>
Or as the guy drinking coffee two tables over said (no doubt regarding<br>
something else...but entirely appropriate none the less)..."Another<br>
Government Screw-up"....<br>
