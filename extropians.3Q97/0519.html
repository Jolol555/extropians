Most people on this list agree that anarchy has numerous advantages over<br>
hierarchy, but how far can this go?<br>
<p>
Can we have a spontaneous order in business?  Could we destroy the hierarchic<br>
structure that plagues current business practise and have a looser, more<br>
anarchic spontaneous order?<br>
<p>
I see this as a possibility, companies could be considered a group of equally<br>
ranked individuals all serving the same goal.  This would be easily<br>
implemented within creative environments, which will probably dominate in the<br>
near future due to automation.<br>
<p>
[Xerox PARC is working on computer systems that will allow companies to be<br>
more spontaneous, ubiquitous computing devices keep track of movement of<br>
people and information and record it.  If many people are in the same room,<br>
the computer classes this as a meeting, the subject of which corresponds to<br>
information displayed on computers at the time of the meeting.  Technology<br>
like this will allow for less paper work and more creativity and innovation<br>
(which can't be a bad thing)]<br>
<p>
To take this a step further: Could these ideas also be applied to education,<br>
an anarchic schooling system?<br>
<p>
I believe this is also possible.  Given that pupils have sufficient<br>
motivation to work, generally they are more likely to work in a looser<br>
system.  Freedom to work at your own pace and to form orders and groups<br>
spontaneously in order to complete set goals could improve education<br>
immensely.<br>
<p>
There has been a long running project in England, which puts children with<br>
behavioural difficulties in a 'school with no rules' (teachers are there for<br>
when children want to learn, but they are not forced to attend classes).<br>
 Generally even children who display the worst behavioural problems start to<br>
work (breaking the rules gets boring if there aren't any rules).<br>
<p>
If pupils are put in to such a anarchic system when they are young (changing<br>
over halfway through a pupils school life could prove disastrous) the want to<br>
work for personal reasons (as opposed to being forced to) should develop at<br>
an early age.  After which point pupils can be given infinite opportunity to<br>
broaden their knowledge and develop creative skills.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that the entire idea of being forced to learn is the cause of<br>
the many closed minds we see today.  Allowing people to develop their own<br>
reasons to better themselves could dramatically change our society for the<br>
better.<br>
