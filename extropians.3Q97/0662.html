<i>&gt;It would be interesting to see if the process of becoming oneself</i><br>
<i>&gt;could be aided by artificial means; so far it has been largely a</i><br>
<i>&gt;random accumulation of experience and a gradual abstraction from</i><br>
<i>&gt;them. Schooling is one method intended to make this process a bit</i><br>
<i>&gt;more efficient, maybe some initiation rites could be considered</i><br>
<i>&gt;growth tools too. Are there others reliable methods?</i><br>
<p>
By "random" you seem to mean "diverse," sort of.  Surely the ideas<br>
and experiences we are exposed to are more systematic than pure noise.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I'm not sure any systematic approaches are more reliable than,<br>
"Expose kids to a choice of lots of random experiences."  I'm not sure<br>
the Prussian-developed schools we have, or initiation rites either,<br>
are improvements over randomness.<br>

<i>&gt;I</i><br>
<i>&gt;suspect that the educational institutions in most countries of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;world need to be shaken up rather severely... I'd like to see a</i><br>
<i>&gt;lot more experimentation and a lot less regimentation going on in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the education industry than currently seems to be the case.</i><br>
<p>
Compare:<br>
"Free enterprise is random, let's have socialism."<br>
"Evolution is too random-seeming, let's believe in God."<br>
"Gas molecules are random--I'm afraid I'll run out of air!"<br>
"God doesn't play dice, physics must be deterministic."<br>
"Self-directed education is too random, let's guide people."<br>
"Building things by moving masses of molecules is too random,<br>
let's have nanotech."<br>
<p>
I think I agree with somewhere between 1.0 and 2.0 of the above!<br>
And I'm not sure I see the pattern.<br>
<p>
Then there are hash codes and Ethernet delay algorithms...<br>
"This process is too prone to bad coincidence, let's make it more random."<br>

 what is then done with the Given by the mind.  The Given is, of course,
 Taken..." --Daniel Dennett
