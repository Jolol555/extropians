<i>&gt;This thread is closely related to the Carter-Leslie Doomsday</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
I notice that I don't want to follow this URL -- not because<br>
I don't like Nicholas or his writings or his topic, whatever<br>
it means, but because I worry that I don't have the time to<br>
read it (note that I assume that it's long), and I feel<br>
overwhelmed.<br>
<p>
Exploring my reactions, I note that I have learned about as<br>
much as I have time to learn or feel that I need to learn about<br>
medicine and physiology from Medline, which consists entirely<br>
of abstracts.  Is it time for an Exline?  I think this would be<br>
a "peer-reviewed" online journal of articles, research, and<br>
debate on futurist topics.  The part most useful to me is that<br>
in order to be eligible for inclusion in such a journal, writers<br>
would be required to supply abstracts for their material that<br>
could be searched and read by busy individuals such as myself.<br>
<p>
What I haven't figured out is why someone would run such a<br>
thing, and why people would consent to review writings -- how<br>
would they get paid?  Presumably if the reviewers are of high<br>
enough reputation, writers will do the abstracts just so they<br>
can submit the papers for review (hm -- this might also result<br>
in some more well-thought-out writings).  Somehow it seems that<br>
subscriptions wouldn't work, because there's so much information<br>
available for free.  Maybe a time-delay subscription, where<br>
people who pay get more articles?<br>
<p>
Darn it, what would *you* pay for?<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
