<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You mention one important word, History. You want to see the conclusive</i><br>

<i>&gt; 100'000 years which means that the gene pool of Canadians (the country</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the world with the best quality of life, according to my last</i><br>
<i>&gt; statistics)</i><br>
<p>
You think our gene pool is roughly the same as France centuries ago?<br>
Obviously you haven't been here.<br>
<p>
People of Euro-descent are a minority at my university.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; is the same of the ruthless troops of Napoleon </i><br>
<p>
Sorry, this comparison doesn't work.  The Napoleonic Code is the<br>
father-document of modern law.  Napoleon's empire was far from<br>
libertarianism/anarcho-capitalism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; or the</i><br>
<i>&gt; British army that destroyed villages one after the other in it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; imperialistic conquest. You want to see how life was with no penalies</i><br>
<i>&gt; for murder? I can write to you some stories of the Dark Ages in Europe,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you want to hear what was life for Portuguese farmers in the 14/15th</i><br>
<i>&gt; centuries or can you just imagine?. Do you think that the German people</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been genetically mutated since the holocaust? The genes are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same, the difference is in education, in memes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You say that armies are the mass murders and not individuals. You are</i><br>
<i>&gt; just telling me I'm right, murderers, just like peaceful persons are a</i><br>
<i>&gt; result of education and not genetic causes (with a few, sporadic,</i><br>
<i>&gt; exceptions). The German army had to work much to make it's soldiers to</i><br>
<i>&gt; kill the Jews, remember that the Germans had an education and the army</i><br>
<i>&gt; had to destroy the compassion German soldiers had in order to use them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The pure human nature, without education can be seen in a state of</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarchy. Inform yourself about the Dark Age or about human life on Earth</i><br>
<i>&gt; when civilization was not yet established. Civilization prevents the</i><br>
<i>&gt; expression of the true human nature by education, by culture.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can argue, most persons are not violent. I might even agree (most</i><br>
<i>&gt; women are much less violent than men) but even that only a minority is</i><br>
<i>&gt; violent in the start (let's imagine a sudden abolition of death penalty</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the US), the others would soon realize that this was the best course</i><br>
<i>&gt; of action (even the most peaceful ones!).</i><br>
<p>
I find your statement that violence is human nature completely ridiculous.<br>
Europe is a bad example because it has always been violent.  Instead, look<br>
at a place like Tibet.  In the far distant past, they were considered the<br>
most violent civilization on earth.  They were bloodthirsty and militant.<br>
They would kill their own warriors on a dime for discipline.  Overnight,<br>
they became what I would call the most peaceful civilisation on earth.  No<br>
government brought around this change, nor was their any great amount of<br>
education available(beside the teaching of Buddha)  Certainly, their<br>
education was of a lesser quality than many of the violent countries that<br>
exist today.  What does this say about human nature?<br>
<p>
I think it says that human nature is a very illusive thing, soon to<br>
eradicated entirely.  Some people live to eat other human beings, some<br>
people live to serve other human beings(not for dinner!)  What is natural?<br>
Is a beaver's dam natural?  Is the Hoover Dam natural?  Does it even<br>
matter?  We're all in the same universe, why do we need a nature, and how<br>
can you see it so clearly? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I see people insulting</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves for small reasons, I see men (yes, men are the main cause of</i><br>
<i>&gt; violence) fighting for practically nothing. As soon as the judicial</i><br>
<i>&gt; system falls, violence is a reality (except, perhaps, in Canada and</i><br>
<i>&gt; other nations with few social problems), just look at Rwanda. Mail me</i><br>
<i>&gt; privately and I'll send a dozen of cases (from peaceful Americans who</i><br>
<i>&gt; were 'carried away' during the riots, ex-Nazi soldiers, stories of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; conquest of America and the slaughter of natives, civil societies before</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1 AD, etc).</i><br>
<p>
People will do bad things, and intrude on others freedoms.  The question<br>
is, do you think it is justified for a governing agency to impede on<br>
EVERYONE'S freedom, to stop these "bad" people?<br>
<p>
How bad do you think people really are?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I don't know (or knew) what negative feedback is, some of you also</i><br>
<i>&gt; disliked this, I still don't understand why, Anton Sherwood wrote:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Be fair, `negative feedback' is a term of art that probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; isn't in an English-Portuguese dictionary.  I understood</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the principle long before I knew what the phrase means.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is actually a phenomenon called feedback inhibition that occurs in</i><br>
<i>&gt; enzymes but from there to knowing what negative feedback is, with only a</i><br>
<i>&gt; few knowledge of economy, goes a long way.</i><br>
<p>
If you are in microbiology, you should know what negative feedback is.  I<br>
learned about negative feedback in high school biology.  If you understand<br>
how the human body regulates hormones in the thyroid, you understand<br>
negative feedback.<br>
<p>
Most hormone systems work by negative feedback.  If hormone A is in excess<br>
in the body, it will initiate the release of another hormone B which will<br>
bind to the hypothalamus and stop the release of hormone A.  <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; As for economy, your arguments haven't convinced me that free-markets</i><br>
<i>&gt; are the best solution, on the contrary, they convinced me that</i><br>
<i>&gt; free-markets aren't a wise solution. Anyway, I shall not discuss this</i><br>
<i>&gt; subject again on the list. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Other thing that seem to have bothered was my lack of knowledge and my,</i><br>
<i>&gt; primitive, questions. Michael Lorrey wrote:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Doesn't anyone read books anymore?  Why do so many people on the net ask</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; elementary questions which are much more satisfactorily answered by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; going to the basic literature rather than by a flurry of incomplete or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sketchy net responses? Who wants to spend time typing in elementary</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; introductions to basic libertarian thought?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I haven't counted all the replies I received but apparently some do.</i><br>
<p>
If you had been here for longer, you would realize that a large amount of<br>
volume on this list is new people coming to the list asking the *same*<br>
questions, making the *same* silly points and mistakes.  This diverts<br>
people's attention from more important topics.  I am definitely guilty of<br>
this crime, and I'll apologize now to all those people who see my newbie<br>
posts as same old, same old.   <br>
<p>
I have, however, learned a lot from my ignorant questions and comments.<br>
My advice for you, Joao, is to be more open to the ideas of the people<br>
that have been here ten times longer than you and have seen many people<br>
come onto this list thinking they know one percent of one percent of<br>
anything.  I don't think anyone who has been on this list for a few months<br>
will make that claim.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It all comes down to individuals taking responsibility for their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; education, and respect for others. What do you think the secretary of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; state would say if you walked into a Cabinet meeting and asked a basic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; question about the Presidency?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First, the secretary of state would need, unlike myself, to know basic</i><br>
<i>&gt; things, that's his job, that's what he's paid for. Second, I sent a</i><br>
<i>&gt; simple message with a few questions, some persons had the time to answer</i><br>
<i>&gt; them. If you really think I shown no respect, I apologize but I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe you've spent more than 10 seconds to read the start of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; message (where it was obvious that I had simple questions) and erase it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If, in those 10 seconds, I made you lose some important business, some</i><br>
<i>&gt; great touchdown or your dinner got cold, I apologize.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe people are glancing over your posts because you have obviously<br>
glanced over the introductory message to this mailing list.  Joao, people<br>
are not impressed with your posts because you have obviously not read any<br>
of the suggested material in the introductory message to this mailing<br>
list.  Your post is not uncommon; on the contrary, posts like yours are<br>
bogging this list, and people are getting a little tired of answering the<br>
same old questions, over and over.  I'm sure you can understand this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On a personal basis, I don't mind talking about subjects that are</i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting to me for hours, I don't mind answering all the questions in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world. Obviously some of you are different, once again, if I caused</i><br>
<i>&gt; any pain to anyone with my message, I apologize. Please note that this</i><br>
<i>&gt; only applies to my first message, the others are just responses to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; responses of persons who had time to answer my questions.</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My reply to Michael Lorry can be basically applied to you but I would</i><br>
<i>&gt; also like to add that insults usually don't make persons do what you</i><br>

<i>&gt; subject.</i><br>
<p>
People begin to lash out a little when they see newbies making blanket,<br>
uniformed statments like "people are violent by nature"(this is a<br>
paraphrase, obviously)  People on this list are very open to new ideas,<br>
and when you say something controversial like it is dogma, it is almost<br>
disturbing.  One of this list's purposes is to get away from "accepted<br>
wisdom" and pontification.<br>
