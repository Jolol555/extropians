Hi Joao<br>
<p>
At 06:56 PM 9/22/97 -0700, you wrote:<br>

<i>&gt;few knowledge of economy, goes a long way.</i><br>
<p>
Just to deal with this one point:<br>
<p>
`Negative feedback' is *not* primarily an economics term, but derives from<br>
systems and control theory and has very general application.  It is at<br>
least 50 years old, and is the basis of all advanced control systems.<br>
Perhaps it is called something entirely different in your own language, but<br>
it is defined in most English dictionaries.  I keep a dictionary on my<br>
desk, and another on my kitchen table, and when I see a word I don't know I<br>
look it up - I don't start by asking other people.  If it's not in the<br>
dictionary, I look in the encyclopedia in my study, and if it's not there<br>
*then* I have no hesitation in asking.  <br>
<p>
The reaction your comment elicited (from me to, I must admit, as I stared<br>
in disbelief at the screen) was rather as if you'd suddenly announced to<br>
the members of an astronomy list that you didn't know the earth orbits the<br>
sun.  This is very unfair to you, of course, but most of the people on this<br>
list (as Lee mentioned) are information/computer specialists, or scientists<br>
of some sort, and feedback is one of the fundamentals of their trades.  <br>
<p>
Is that enough to make people cross?  Perhaps not.  Here's an additional<br>
factor:<br>
<p>
The term is regularly abused in the general English-speaking culture.  New<br>
Age types, and many others, are always smiling gratefully when they receive<br>
what they call `positive feedback' (meaning, for them, encouragement or<br>
praise) and recoiling from the dreaded `negative reinforcement' (meaning,<br>
they suppose, disapproval).  In fact, positive feedback is nothing more<br>
than returning a part of the system's output in such a way that the output<br>
*increases*, while negative feedback uses part of the system's current<br>
output to *restrict* or *lower* continuing output.  (So, in a restricted<br>
sense, smiling at each other *is* `positive feedback', since it makes us<br>
feel good and improves our mood.)<br>
<p>
But if you are being rhetorically beaten savagely about the head by angry<br>
extropians, or literally by nasty thugs, your cries of apology can act as<br>
negative feedback to the social interaction, causing them (we hope) to beat<br>
you less cruelly.  If your cries merely excite their rage and blood-lust<br>
(as often happens with attackers, I'm told), this would be positive<br>
feedback that would get you beaten shitless.  Not at all `positive' in the<br>
usual meaning of the word.<br>
<p>
I realise you know all this by now; I'm just trying to convey the<br>
complicated kinds of annoyance your innocent request for information<br>
triggered.  :)<br>
