Everyone making their own nanotech machines *is* the global (using global in<br>
terms of distributed) immune system.  Anything else would be a central immune<br>
system, and we don't want that, do we?<br>

<p>
Competition is of paramount importance to progress.  It's likely that the<br>
people making the most out of nanotech won't be the same people who invented<br>
it - scientists aren't very good at selling things (and I don't care how<br>
great it is.. if it doesn't have a brand name it's history).<br>

I have a quantum computer, it only works when consciously observed.<br>
