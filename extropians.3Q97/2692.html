I really enjoyed reading the post about Franklin's and other's fight <br>
against all the backward superstitious things people think. It's got me <br>
thinking about some of the discussions I have been reading in the various <br>
chat rooms and NGs; particularly the ones dealing with religion or social <br>
issues. For the most part, Christians and other "main stream" religions are <br>
comfortable with scientific reasoning even though they may not always agree <br>
with the moral implications of the technology that science makes possible. <br>
But there seems to be a strong presents of others on the net that <br>
categorize themselves as witches, pagans, and other similar religions that <br>
attack not traditional theology issues but scientific thinking its self. <br>
They are very preoccupied with magic and belief systems that could care <br>
less about the natural environment as understood by the scientific <br>
community<br>
<p>
What is of interest to me is they claim to be growing in numbers. I believe <br>
their growth just may be true because the primary motivation for their <br>
growth is a hatred of science its self - something I hear more and more of <br>
every day from lots of different people. Many of the things that science <br>
makes possible can be real scary to people who don't have the benefit of a <br>
good education. This, combined with the fact that the cutting edge of <br>
science in many fields is no longer intuitive and understandable to an <br>
average person makes many people want to go to a simpler belief system that <br>
is pre-enlightenment in nature.<br>
<p>
I get the sense that many of these people are spiritually scared to death <br>
about the very subjects that this list talks about on a regular basis. I <br>
also think that they are gaining in influence and isolating science from <br>
everyday life replacing it with superstition. That is real bad. One day, <br>
science just may find that it is locked in a castle with the peasants <br>
outside the gate with their pitchforks and torches wanting to burn it for <br>
its heresy.<br>
<p>
It seems the enlightenment is very fragile indeed and we should not take it <br>
for granted.<br>
