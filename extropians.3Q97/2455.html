<i>        &gt;government policies the country is being *flooded* by poor immigrants         </i><br>

           <br>
<p>
So what? The problem is not the immigrants but the welfare system they find <br>
when they get there. If a country draws a line around its borders and says <br>
anyone who is inside that line gets all sorts of nifty financial benefits but <br>
anyone outside that line does not, then free immigration can not be allowed. <br>
I think free immigration is a basic human right and that's one of many reasons <br>
I oppose welfare. Fortunately it's becoming increasingly difficult to stop <br>
people from going where they want to go or hearing what they want to hear, <br>
and that's why I'm optimistic the present system is breaking down.<br>

<i>        &gt;becoming the number one religion after the turn of the century </i><br>
           <br>
<p>
So what? True, Islam is an idiotic religion, but no more so than the <br>
Christian religion, or the Jewish, or the Hindu, or the Druid, or the UFO, <br>
or the ...<br>
           <br>

<i>        &gt;*They* breed a lot faster than "we" do. </i><br>

<p>
Who is "we"?  I'm not Dutch. <br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I guess we all know what happens to tolerance, progress and liberal         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;ideas in general when Islam takes over...)</i><br>
           <br>
<p>
Things change, nothing is fixed in concrete. Historically Islam has been much  <br>
more tolerant of foreign ideas than Christianity, it's only in this century  <br>
that things changed. They can change again. <br>
<p>
I must say, if you attach a vast significance to the trivial little <br>
differences in culture or physical appearance among various groups of humans <br>
today, then you will be as unprepared as most people for the phase change in <br>
life of truly astronomical magnitude that will happen in less than a century.<br>
                                                     <br>
BTW, I assume by "liberal" you're using the 19'th century meaning, where the <br>
word mente more personal freedom and open to new ideas, the very opposite of <br>
today's meaning.                                    <br>
