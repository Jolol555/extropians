Where do you get the ideas that truth has much to do with the spread of<br>
memes?  Most people have somewhat limited facilities to test the truth of a<br>
meme (in terms of research and experimentation) and, insofar as they have<br>
facilities, they don't use them.  I know people who haven't been to a library<br>
in years, and I have relatively well-educated friends.<br>
<p>
The most powerful and successful memes in human society either don't address<br>
truth (such as fashions, language, or fiction) or succeed mostly<br>
independently of their truth (religion and political systems).  Memes spread<br>
mostly on their catchiness, and conspiracy memes definitely fall in that<br>
category.  Generally speaking, conspiracy theories do worse amongst<br>
scientists, probably the best extant truth-analyzers, than the general<br>
populace.<br>
