<p>
Could you please be more specific? What events have occurred in<br>
your forty years of experience in government that cause you to<br>
disagree with Perry's analysis? The four lines that you posted<br>
(after quoting *all* of Perry's post) have no content: they're a<br>
simple assertion of your experience without any details or evidence,<br>
and you might as well have forgone posting them at all for all the<br>
useful information they contain.<br>
<p>
Essentially you've informed all of us that you disagree with<br>
Perry, and that's all. Did you relly need to quote every single<br>
line of Perry's post to do that? Do you think that your<br>
informing us that you disagree with Perry did anything to<br>
improve the quality of information being presented to list<br>
subscribers?<br>

Dear Eric and other fellow Extropians,
<p>
I respectfully suspect that Eric may be kvetching for the sake of
kvetching.
<p>
During my service to the US Congress I was involved in drafting and/or
analyzing several thousand pieces of legislation that effected and
(hopefully) helped to advance the cause of social evolution. 
<p>
I could name more than a few pieces of legislation I helped to formulate
but it would be quite meaningless in the overall context of our continuing
social evolution.
Obviously, any given policy determination has, by itself, usually, a very
minor effect.  
<p>
Possibly, part of the problem is that almost no one outside of a few
professionals are aware how much legislation is introduced  in the House
and Senate any given term. Much of what is drafted, amended and passed is
quite technical and, unfortunately, quite complex and arcane. 
<p>
Almost all of the public is quite unaware of how the legislative process
actually works. Among the many things I'm still learning is that any
relationship between political science as taught in most colleges and
universities and governmental administration as it actually functions and
transpires is purely coincidental. Civics, as taught in almost all
secondary schools is, at best, horribly superficial and frequently
misguided. The same, of course, can be said for the teaching of
evolutionary biology at most academic levels.
<p>
During my current work with the NYS legislature, I frequently focus on
consumer protection legislation as an example in point. But, most of my
modifications to the general business law, the general obligations law,
etc., receive scant public notice.
<p>
Since the focus of this discussion is supposed to be on the philosophy of
advancing humanity through various means I dont see any point in being any
more specific. My purpose in this academic exchange is to expand my
horizons by learning as well as expressing my experiential views.
<p>
I trust that you will all respect that.
<p>
Enjoy!!!
<p>
