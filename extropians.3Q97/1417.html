I understand your fears... I like my family too (and for <br>
traditional reasons there is no polygamy (nor even<br>
homosx). But, If we broad our minds, I really do not see any <br>
reason why, for example, a man cannot have more than one wife (if he <br>
earns enough ... and they too - it is important...), loving <br>
themselves and all being happy and... a real family. Real familiar <br>
relashionships transcend laws, courts and... religions.We may have <br>
lots of sisters, and love them without making sex, why not wives, <br>
it is not because of the same sex is it???: Just tradition and... a <br>
little (lot) os egoism from women (in general and socially) which are <br>
not so friends of each other as they want to appear so... E G O I S <br>
M!!! Haven't you seen those happy mormons with their many wives ??? <br>
It seems like a homy heaven... (or, sometimes, hell.. hehehe... <br>
water!? water!?)<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Regards and evolution... (let's not forget such interesting aspect <br>
and... good interface to loving more the existence...) <br>
<p>
I surely want (not just guess or believe) that in the near future, <br>
less than a century period,  the great majority of behavioural <br>
impositions will not survive because of  the so-called inteligent <br>
development... Else the Homo cyber will really separate <br>
(obviously in peace...) from the Homo sapiens "teological", and this <br>
that continue dieing, killing each other and hoping "to go to <br>
heaven".... Polygamy, for example will be completely free. ( real <br>
democracy is yet far from being stabilished in present reallity... <br>
possibly because people, in general, have no intelectual conditions <br>
yet to take their own wheels, and still need rails to walking without <br>
crashing with other... Tres Ridicule..) <br>
