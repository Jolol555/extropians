Yes, promote widespread stock ownership. It's happening without prompting,<br>
but I'd like to see more people especially at the lower income levels<br>
buying shares. Nothing fancy, if they don't have the head for it. Just a<br>
decent index fund. While I oppose the state distributing (stealing) income,<br>
I wouldn't have a problem with tax incentives to promote wider stock<br>
ownership. (That just means taking less away from people who invest.)<br>

Hans Moravec, in his talk back at EXTRO 1 also proposed taxes when it<br>
seemed that having everyone own stock in the robot-factories would<br>
accomplish the same without all the overhead, control, and inevitable<br>
problems of putting the state in the center of things.<br>
