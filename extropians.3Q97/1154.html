Right, I misinterpreted what you said.<br>

Well, in my experience the kind of people we were hiring in that company<br>
(basically very smart and with a desire to work in a company with few<br>
rules) had no problems working together, or with most customers. Dealing<br>
with managers ("let me get this straight; you're reprimanding me for<br>
making our software ten times faster?"), marketing ("You know these new<br>
full-page ads which claim our software does A, B, C, X, Y, and Z? You do<br>
realise that we *don't* do X, Y or Z?") and stupid customers ("You did<br>
WHAT?") is another matter. Of course that kind of thing eventually made<br>
most of the smart people leave and the share price is now down to 1/10 of<br>
its peak value. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Or are you arguing that those skills are</i><br>

<p>
I wasn't arguing that, but I'd say it's generally true. Smart people<br>
usually learn quickly; that's why they're smart. <br>
