You make a very good point.  However, those who have built a better <br>
mousetrap invariably get bought out by Microsoft.  So little of what <br>
they have actually created has been orginal or creative.  They have <br>
advanced only to the degree necessary to maintain their market dominance <br>
- which isn't much.<br>
<p>

their<br>

<i>&gt;than Microsoft's previous versions. </i><br>
<p>
I heartedly agree that Apple has made some serious blunders.  The way I <br>
see it, is Apple's had superior technology with a rotten marketing <br>
strategy, and Microsoft has had the superior marketing staregy with a <br>
poor software package.  But that is another story.<br>
