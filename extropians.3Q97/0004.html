<i>&gt;If everybody adopted a tit-for-tat strategy most people and the world in</i><br>
<i>&gt;general would be better off, however a mutant that always defected would do</i><br>
<i>&gt;better than anybody else in such a population. A defector would produce more</i><br>
<i>&gt;descendants,  until a sizable fraction of the population were defectors, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;then they would be worse off  than their honest contemporaries and their</i><br>
<i>&gt;numbers decline.</i><br>
<p>
[OVERSIMPLIFICATION ALERT]<br>
In a population of 10 people, if 9 play tit-for-tat and one always defects,<br>
the 9 will be defected against 10% of the time, and the one will be defected<br>
against 100% of the time.  This isn't useful for producing descendants.<br>
<p>
The reason you don't see 100% honest people is that a) most people don't<br>
consistently play tit-for-tat, and b) hardly anybody _always_ defects<br>
("honor among thieves" and all).<br>
