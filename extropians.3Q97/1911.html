<p>
This is simple: I don't know which slit the photon/electron is going to go<br>
through and I can't find out.  I have to send more than one photon/electron<br>
towards the slits to make sure they go through, they are likely to go through<br>
both.  All this says to me is that interference between photons and electrons<br>
isn't effected by time.  If I send them through one at a time I get<br>
interference from the one I haven't sent through yet, but I still have to<br>
send through both slits at some point in time.<br>
<p>
Am I missing something?<br>
<p>

<p>
Too late.<br>

--Wax<br>
<p>
P.S. Just to add to the weirdness (you enjoy it really).  If at some point we<br>
prove that Everett theory is true, the universe will split into two (or more)<br>
realities, one where the theory is true (this one) and one where it is not.<br>
 Because in the other reality the theory is not true, our reality cannot<br>
exist!  So as soon as we consciously observe the existence of many worlds,<br>
those many worlds will collapse leaving only one!<br>
