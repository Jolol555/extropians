Yes, but we are not yet in that perspective.  We can imagine<br>
being in that place, but we are not physically there.<br>
<p>
Also, there is plenty of information about my history that is unknown<br>
to me, and the value (to me) of which is unknown.  My past light cone<br>
includes the whole planet's history, so any information from that<br>
part of my past light cone is potentially valuable to me. *That*<br>
information, once lost, cannot be reconstructed in any reasonable<br>
amount of time or with any reasonable expenditure of resources; even<br>
if it could be reconstructed, the search costs of extracting that<br>
little needle of ER from the haystack of cosmic computational goo<br>
would be very high. The importance of information is not that<br>
it exists off somewhere... the importance of it is whether I<br>
can get it into my head and use it.<br>
<p>
Gaia is something in which I am embedded, whether I like it or not, <br>
and as yet I have no guarantee of escape.  As long as this is the<br>
case, I shy away from the the perspective that views Gaia as a worm,<br>
and I feel no need to apologize for doing so.<br>
