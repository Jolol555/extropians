There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time during<br>
the last 15 years. As I recall, there were no dung beetles in Australia.<br>
When the settlers introduced cattle the dung piles began to kill the<br>
grass.<br>
I forgot the outcome, but I think the settlers ended up importing them.<br>
