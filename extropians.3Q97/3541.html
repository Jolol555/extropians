Gasp! you mean to tell me that this list is *filled* with ethnic,<br>
physically challenged, used-to-be-factoryworkers that are over 45 and<br>
earning less than $20K per year? Wow...<br>
In that case I must have really been mistaken about who's on this list.<br>
Sorry guys...<br>
<p>
I will have a look at Ayn Rand's work however.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I have *no* obligations to other human beings other than the ones I</i><br>

<p>

<p>

There's no need to shout. Some of us may be hard-headed, we're not deaf.<br>
<p>
Well... maybe thing are different in the US (even more than I thought).<br>
Better not visit the Netherlands or Switserland, such an attitude could get<br>
you imprisoned for up to 10 years. Neglect is considered a very bad thing,<br>
by law.<br>
At this moment there are 5 foreign tourists under investigation in<br>
Switserland for not-helping someone in an emergency situation. They might<br>
very well go to prison for several years.<br>
<p>
Of course you are right, rationally speaking. Rationally speaking human<br>
life also has no value in itself... (it's just a convention right?)<br>
Purely rationally speaking there's really no point in anything is there?<br>
        Maybe rationality isn't everything... ;-)<br>
