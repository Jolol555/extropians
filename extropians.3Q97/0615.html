<i>&gt;  Neanderthals lived from 300,000 to 30,000 years ago, fully modern humans</i><br>

years. <br>

but I <br>

<p>
The only difference between a dead species and the most advanced species to<br>
exist on earth is the ability to create art!  This is very significant!  Take<br>
a look around you for a minute, look at all this technology we have, do we<br>
need it? No, we could have made our lives much simpler by staying in the<br>
caves, it's creativity for creativity's sake.  We create things to challenge<br>
and interest us - we are artists.<br>
