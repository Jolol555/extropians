<i> &gt; Voluntary actions? You're talking of voluntary, unselfish actions</i><br>

<i> &gt; other members of the same species? I don't think that's possible</i><br>
<i> &gt; in today's world, there's just too many greedy and selfish persons.</i><br>
<p>
Language problem here: "voluntary" has nothing to do with<br>
"unselfish".  Voluntary means uncoerced.  <br>
<p>
I prefer to stay away from higgling and haggling over selfishness<br>
and altruism: you can come up with an altruistic rationalization<br>
for any course of action just as easily as you can come up with a<br>
selfish-sounding rationalization. (Well, I can, anyway, so<br>
worrying about whether I'm being selfish or altruistic does me<br>
no good whatsoever.  The point is to do the right thing, not the<br>
selfish or altruistic thing.)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; In all your messages there is a hate towards government, I also</i><br>
<i> &gt; despise politicians but don't corporations 'own' the government,</i><br>
<i> &gt; even in the U.S.? It's the same thing, the same problem.</i><br>
<p>
Do the multinational corporations own the governments, or do the<br>
governments own the multinational corporations?  Which of the two<br>
is carrying the guns (and nukes and Sarin etc.)?  It's a<br>
tangled mess, and asserting "it's the same thing" really<br>
doesn't get us any closer to solving it.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I'll be honest, I don't know what negative feedback is and I know</i><br>
<i> &gt; nothing of basic economics but I always knew that "united we stand,</i><br>
<i> &gt; divided we fall". If a corporation starts achieving a substantial</i><br>
<i> &gt; advantage towards everyone else, as it grows, it will eventually</i><br>
<i> &gt; become more efficient, more capable, will be able to have the most</i><br>
<i> &gt; competitive prices and therefore, will achieve a monopoly status.</i><br>
<i> &gt; Right? </i><br>
<p>
No.  Economies of scale don't automatically apply in every<br>
industry, and there is usually a "diminishing returns" effect.<br>
Monopolies are almost invariably the result of regulators<br>
imposing barriers to entry in the market upon potential new<br>
competitors.  Sometimes this is done explicitly, as with the<br>
PTTs and many country's power industries, sometimes it is done<br>
in a more hidden manner, as with the banking industries, etc.<br>
A market in which the two or three leaders have 60% to 80%<br>
market share is not a monopoly.  A PTT, on the other hand, is a<br>
real monopoly, with all the insidious effects thereof.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; (I see that in Portugal every time, small shops complaining about</i><br>
<i> &gt; big commercial centers and supermarkets)</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but which do the customers complain about?  Businesses<br>
exist to serve consumers, not the other way around.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; You talk about how the market will control big corporations and</i><br>
<i> &gt; the millions of consumers will lead the market into the best path,</i><br>
<i> &gt; let me ask you something, why is government so corrupt? People</i><br>
<i> &gt; theoretically control government (by voting) and still government</i><br>
<i> &gt; is corrupt, why is that? What makes you think that indirect control</i><br>
<i> &gt; of economy by persons is going to improve anything?</i><br>
<p>
You might try a web-search on "public choice theory".  I don't know<br>
if you'll turn up anything good, but that's where you'll find some<br>
preliminary answers to the questions you are asking.  I'm sorry I<br>
don't have a clear enough understanding of the details of public<br>
choice theory myself to be able to whip out a snappy answer to the<br>
particular questions you are asking.<br>
<p>
I don't see anyone here claiming that consumers will lead the market<br>
into the best path.  Consumers will lead the market into producing<br>
huge amounts of drugs, cosmetics, pornography, cheesy magazines,<br>
cheap food, mediocre music, etc, just as they always have.  The<br>
claim is that the market mechanisms will do a better job than the<br>
political mechanisms, not that they will do a perfect or optimal<br>
job.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; EvMick says that free-market works, my question is for whom, for</i><br>
<i> &gt; the persons who are already wealthy or for the ones who are poor</i><br>
<i> &gt; and have nothing?</i><br>
<p>
For both.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Since unselfish reasons rarely incentives anyone to do anything,</i><br>
<i> &gt; let me ask you something, do you think that the poorer classes</i><br>
<i> &gt; generated by free-markets will stand still? My bet is that they'll</i><br>
<i> &gt; riot and that is what I fear.</i><br>
<p>
The poorer clases are not generated by free markets, the poorer<br>
classes are generated by oppressive taxation and regulation<br>
which hinders the market from providing them with goods, jobs,<br>
and services.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I read books, I find it, however, much less boring and time consuming</i><br>
<i> &gt; to ask other persons. Or do you read a book every time you have a</i><br>
<i> &gt; doubt or a question?</i><br>
<p>
This is an acceptable attitude for simple questions, like those<br>
in astrophysics, for instance, but you are asking questions<br>
about extremely complex phenomena.  All you are likely to get<br>
from a short-and-choppy medium like this one is some good<br>
bibliographic references.  Like I say, public-choice theory<br>
would be one place to start, but I'm not yet familiar enough<br>
with that literature to even be able to give you a specific<br>
biblio ref off the top of my head.<br>
<p>
And your asking questions about these matters on this list is<br>
much less boring for *you* and much less time-consuming for<br>
*you*.  This is not necessarily symmetrical with regard to the<br>
people whom you are asking to dig up this information for you,<br>
though.  I don't mind, but this is something you might take<br>
into account when reading posts like Chris Tame's.<br>
