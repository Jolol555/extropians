<p>
In this case, the explanation will rely less on the notion of evolution<br>
than on *consolation*.  It has been among the principal functions of<br>
philosophy to provide its adherents a kind of consolation that no other<br>
enterprise could afford.  For finite beings imperiled by death, desease,<br>
and the disasters of politics, philosophy promised a method by means of<br>
which one could presumably rise above the discord, to attach oneself to<br>
something greater than finitude and so make some sense out of the human<br>
condition.  Needless to say, times have changed.  To the extent that<br>
philosophy has any role at all, it should be one of problem-solving.  I<br>
like to think of philosophers as people suited by talent, temperament, and<br>
circumstance to provide new descriptions that shake up complacent<br>
perceptions and effect reconciliations among apparently antagonistic<br>
viewpoints. Philosophers are hardly the only people in our society who can<br>
undertake this task -- novelists, journalists, and songwriters are often<br>
far better at it, for example -- but this still seems to me a worthy<br>
*contemporary* (and future) task for the discipline. Certainly, the<br>
provision of the so-called "metaphysical comforts" stands in the way of<br>
this task and it's high time for philosophy to bag its sadly medieval<br>
self-image for disposal.  <br>
	I guess this discussion is inexcusably far from the conversation<br>
that initiated it...  suffice it to say that philosophy has disastrously<br>
exacerbated the human tendency to treat the familiar as the inevitable, by<br>
stoking the fantasy that there can be descriptions of the world (e.g., the<br>
magical ones that are Right, Good, Beautiful, and True) that are not just<br>
the best on offer but which halt the quest for the better by somehow<br>
"saying the way the world is".  Philosophy as an institution (read<br>
Aristotle, or practically any philosopher up to and including Nietzsche<br>
and Freud) and the philosophical sensibility more generally, have no small<br>
share in the sociocultural maintenance of retrograde conceptions and<br>
institutions of sex, race, gender, beastliness, madness, age, ability,<br>
criminality, health, etc. <br>
	Best, Dale<br>
