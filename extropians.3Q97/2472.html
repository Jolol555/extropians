<i>&gt; I want to repeat this, because it's important.  Our immune systems are the</i><br>

<i>&gt; years under continuous assualt by our immune systems and the designed</i><br>
<i>&gt; pharmaceuticals of science.  And really lethal viruses, the truly destructive</i><br>
<i>&gt; ones, kill us directly.</i><br>
<p>
This ignores one thing: viruses do not destroy, they create.  A virus is<br>
primarily interested in reproduction, not destruction.  Any destruction<br>
which occurs is largely a side effect, bursting cells to free the newborn<br>
virus particles.  This does play some role in helping the spread of<br>
the virus, but probably it would be even better for the virus if the<br>
converted cells were able to keep cranking out new virii indefinately,<br>
and there were some mechanism to get them out of the cell.  In some cases<br>
it is the body's own immune system which destroys virus-producing cells,<br>
not the virus itself.<br>
<p>
The creation-vs-destruction model is a misleading picture of what happens<br>
in viral infections.<br>
<p>
Applying this to the gray goo scenario, the thing to remember is that the<br>
gray goo must replicate in order to be effective.  A single gray goo<br>
disassembler will not cause much damage.  And whatever mechanisms it uses<br>
to replicate will be vulnerable to attack just as much as the systems which<br>
it is trying to "eat".<br>
<p>
In nature, we have a distinction between predators and prey.  Large numbers<br>
of animals have pretty much given up on trying to defend themselves,<br>
relying instead on avoiding predation, and fast enough reproduction to<br>
overcome the loss due to predators.  This leads to a model where we think<br>
of gray goo replicators as the predators, and ordinary nanotech as prey.<br>
<p>
But this is not the right model.  Think instead of interactions among<br>
predators, each seeking to be as aggressive as possible against the<br>
others.  Think of lions attacking bears, badgers against wolverines.<br>
Think of armies against armies, or spy vs spy.<br>
<p>
Barring nuclear destruction, it is not clear that gray goo will win<br>
the battle.  Gray goo is not interested solely in destruction.  Rather,<br>
it is a replicator like everyone else; it seeks to preserve its own<br>
structure and function, it seeks to reproduce, it seeks to protect itself.<br>
It must do these things in order to survive.<br>
<p>
My prediction would be a band of "war zones", where the battle rages,<br>
with surges as one side or the other gets a local advantage.  Between<br>
these zones would be relatively stable regions, dominated by cooperating<br>
replicators.  But the border shifts, and occasionally a stable region<br>
is overcome.<br>
<p>
Each side seeks to destroy the other, but that is an over-simplification.<br>
Actually there are many factions, some seeking to destroy all others,<br>
others cooperating.  Can game theory give us cause to believe that the<br>
nice (in the technical sense) replicators will win?  Will the hackers<br>
and madmen cooperate in their efforts to destroy the world, or isn't it<br>
more likely that each attempts to destroy all others?  As the good-guy<br>
nanotech cooperates while bad-guy factions kill each other, it may well<br>
be that we can expect the good guys to have an advantage.<br>
