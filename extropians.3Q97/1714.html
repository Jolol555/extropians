<i>&gt; Whether you understand</i><br>
<i>&gt; this or not is beside the point: that some people have understandings</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the world that are currently inaccessible to others is exactly</i><br>
<i>&gt; why the principle of self-ownership is so vitally important.</i><br>
<p>
Hear, hear.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; The only reason there is *not* to cryonically suspend [or otherwise</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; save] a reluctant person, is when you *don't really care*. Period.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm sorry, but I see no conflict between deeply caring about</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone and deeply respecting eir self-ownership and eir ability</i><br>
<i>&gt; to control eir own life.</i><br>
<p>
Nor do I. I find Heinlein's "How do I know it won't interfere with<br>
immortality?" to be poignant and bittersweet, not a sign that I (or<br>
someone) should have hijacked his corpse from the crematorium.<br>
<p>
There are circumstances ("lifeboat scenarios") when it can be countenanced<br>
that principles, civility, and self-government have to go out the window.<br>
<p>
To declare such circumstances carries risks--one of which is to be<br>
believed to be right by others _who are mistaken_.<br>

PS:<br>
<p>
I once wrote a story (it was poorly written, so I'll blow the twist<br>
ending) about Ayn Rand having been "brought back" by a team in the far<br>
future. Who she is is kept somewhat veiled, but there are lots of clues.<br>
<p>
The twist: this isn't the first time they've brought her back--seems as<br>
soon as she is able to get up and around, and realizes what her past<br>
is/was, she understands they did this without consulting her--and kills<br>
herself. Every time. And "they" don't get it--"they" keep trying.<br>
<p>
We all get one life and one death. If they're not ours, whose are they?<br>
And who says?<br>
