Hi!<br>
<p>
Even that one reaches death with few neurological destruction (which is<br>
normally not the case), current techniques in cryopreservation damage<br>
the cells severely. We are talking about bodies and not cell cultures.<br>
To freeze a cell culture is easy but it must be done very gently not to<br>
destroy the cells, to freeze a whole body is impossible without major<br>
cell damage. Why?<br>
<p>
It's simple, even if you're only frizzing the head, the temperatures<br>
will always vary considerably between the cells at different positions.<br>
More, the ideal rate at which you decrease the temperature surely varies<br>
amongst different cell types. I read at least one good documented<br>
experience (I'll try to find the authors) with the freezing of an<br>
animal's brain in which they concluded that extensive tissue damaged was<br>
observed. To give you another example, in the laboratory, only minimal<br>
quantities of cells can be frizzed correctly, you can verify this at any<br>
biology laboratory. You can argue that some destruction is caused in the<br>
unfreezing process and that in the future this process will be perfect.<br>
I don't know for sure exactly what are the percentages of cells damaged<br>
in the freezing and unfreezing process but I expect that the cells<br>
damaged in the unfreezing process to be less. If cells are not damaged<br>
when the unfreezing process begins, they will not be destroyed then,<br>
perhaps some cases of cells that are a bit damaged can be saved with<br>
more advanced unfreezing processes but I'm moving to areas in which my<br>
(and everyone, I suppose) knowledge is limited. I agree with Anders<br>
Sandberg when he says that most of the damage is done in the freezing<br>
process and not while we are frizzed.<br>

<p>
That doesn't mean they will accomplish their goal. Besides, just because<br>
they can unfreeze you, that doesn't mean they will. Remember, they will<br>
only unfreeze you when aging is controlled and that can take a while.<br>
<p>
Speaking about how long it will take for us to control aging, never<br>
forget that even when we correct all the errors in our genome that<br>
create aging now, we will have to worry about the errors that will cause<br>
us diseases when we are 200, 300 or 1000 years old! Our knowledge will<br>
have to advance faster than the millions of genetic errors that millions<br>
of years of evolution have not corrected, it's a very difficult task<br>
(that's why I'm 19 and already worrying about aging). For more see "Why<br>
are We Allowed to Age?" in <a href="http://mithlond.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/why.htm">http://mithlond.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/why.htm</a><br>
(remember I asked this a couple of months ago?)<br>
<p>
As a conclusion, I think that for old persons going to cryonics their<br>
chances of immortality are minimal. If one is cryopreservated at an<br>
early age with few brain damage then he might survive.<br>
<p>
As for the identity issues, there are many interesting situations. Like<br>
persons who endure terrible accidents or drug abuses. There is a case in<br>
which a man had an iron through he's brain that completely changed his<br>
personality although his intelligence was pretty much the same as<br>
before. Is this the same person as before? I think not. Am I the same<br>
person I was 10 years ago (neural changes have been huge)? No but I<br>
changed, I blossomed into another person in a continuos process and that<br>
is not the case in cryonics or accidents. Anyway, I'm not planning to<br>
have irons going through my brain neither going to cryonics, I'll just<br>
concentrate my efforts on the aging research.<br>
<p>
Thank you all for your replies.<br>
