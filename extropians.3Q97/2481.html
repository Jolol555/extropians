<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Numbers, please. It is easy to claim something like this, but is it</i><br>
<i>&gt; really true? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Building a nuke: you need around 10 kilograms of uranium 235 (or whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; isotope it was). There is around 2 grams uranium / tonne in the crust of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; earth, of which 0.72% is U235, so to get 10 kg you need to process around </i><br>
<i>&gt; 7000 tonnes of crust. I'm not sure how much energy is required to reduce</i><br>
<i>&gt; the UO2 to pure U, but it is a noticeable amount (are there a chemist</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the house?). Assuming the nanites cover a large patch with solar</i><br>
<i>&gt; collectors, they can get around 500 W/m^2, which has to cover their</i><br>
<i>&gt; replication, search through the crust, reduction, isotope separation and return</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the "base"; how much energy this is is a bit hard to tell right now </i><br>
<i>&gt; (it is 1.30 in the morning here :-), but it looks like it will take</i><br>
<i>&gt; a while for the bomb-mold to blow up. A wild guess would be around a </i><br>
<i>&gt; week. </i><br>
<p>
Even so, the nanites could cover continents with construction sites <br>
so you couldn't bomd them all out. Dynamite should be much easier and <br>
serve just as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Doing the same work as a nuke with nanites (i.e. disassembling everything</i><br>
<i>&gt; within a few hundred meters and blasting everything within a few kilometers)</i><br>
<i>&gt; is rather tricky, since it is extremely energy intensive. You need plenty</i><br>
<i>&gt; of energy to do the disassembly (essentially you have to break most molecular</i><br>
<i>&gt; bonds)</i><br>
<p>
As I asked in an ealier posing, wouldn't you *gain* energy if you <br>
then reassemble them to compounds with higher binding energy?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; it is IMHO clear that we should not be overly worried about</i><br>
<i>&gt; nano-built nuclear weapons but rather nano-ebola.</i><br>
<p>
I think Eliezer was trying to establish a lower buond on the <br>
destructive capability. The reason I begun to talk about dynamite was <br>
that it would mean that we can be certain that the bunkers you <br>
suggested wouldn't work agains a designed killer nanite.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Our immune systems are unimaginably more sophisticated than a virus or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bacterium, using controlled evolution to combat natural evolution.  And yet we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; still suffer from colds and diseases.  The only reason that the viruses</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; haven't killed us outright is that it isn't good strategy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Exactly. So the major question is: is it possible to create a nanite</i><br>
<i>&gt; infection that is deadly (or subtle) enough to wipe out all competition?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't reflexively answer 'yes' to it, try to give a considered</i><br>
<i>&gt; answer of why it is likely (or why not). </i><br>
<p>
Yes, if it is the first nanite infection, there would be no <br>
competition to compete with! (Biological organisms compete in a lower <br>
division.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is easier to destroy than create!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You repeat this as a mantra. And of course you have the second law of</i><br>
<i>&gt; thermodynamics on your side. The problem is that you do not attempt to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make quantitative comparisions between the strengths of different systems,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and instead rely on plausible-sounding arguments. That is definitely</i><br>
<i>&gt; *not* a good strategy if you are trying to discuss something important</i><br>
<i>&gt; where we do need a well planned policy.</i><br>
<p>
I agree. We need to try to spell out arguments carefully.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; let's try a simple sketch to see how easy it is to vanquish a designed</i><br>
<i>&gt; immune system:</i><br>
<p>
That's the spirit we like on this list!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The body is surrounded by an inert skin (say diamond); attempts to</i><br>
<i>&gt; physically breach it can be detected from the inside and the surrounding</i><br>
<i>&gt; region sealed. The rest of the organism (could be a transhuman, factory</i><br>
<i>&gt; or a city) is compartmentalized with similar walls; infected sections</i><br>
<i>&gt; can be isolated.</i><br>
<p>
Well, if the organism is in a free environment, then the plague would <br>
attack all parts of the skin simultaneously. The whole skin would <br>
thus have to be shed. The plague would immediately attack again, and <br>
soon the organism would run out of resources. Alternatively, the <br>
plague could build explosives and blast your organism. So it seems <br>
that your organism could not be a transhuman, factory or a city, but <br>
would have to be the whole planet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Immune devices move around, interrogating "cells"</i><br>
<i>&gt; (subsystems) by comparing their surface markings with allowed types</i><br>
<i>&gt; (this list can be kept secret from someone who disassembles a device</i><br>
<i>&gt; by using a trapdoor function), and occasionally disassembling the </i><br>
<i>&gt; cell to check its innards. Other immune devices check the general</i><br>
<i>&gt; activity, looking for deviations from the normal state</i><br>
<p>
And if the organism is the whole planet, then this would of course be <br>
equivalent to a totalitarian state. (Deviations from the normal <br>
state= activities of some individual that the state does not approve <br>
of, even if that individual hasn't harmed anybody yet.)<br>
<p>
It is still interesting to see where this will lead. This thread <br>
continues to produce an extraordinary number of interesting comments! <br>
