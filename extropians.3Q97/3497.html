Welll...well ...well....loookky here..<br>
<p>
A Stolen Election?<br>
Don't stop probe of Sanchez-Dornan race<br>
<p>
San Diego Union-Tribune (a Copely Newspaper)<br>
Editorial Page  9/4/97<br>
<p>
House Republicans and Democrats alike acknowledge that fraudulent<br>
votes were cast in last November's Orange County congressional race<br>
pitting nine-term Republican Bob Dornan against Democratic challenger<br>
Loretta Sanchez.  Yet, Democratic lawmakers are threatening to disrupt<br>
daily business in the House unless an investigation of the<br>
Dornan-Sanchez contest is halted immediately.<br>
<p>
<p>
Now what was said earlier about "just vote them out of<br>
office"..."accepting<br>
responsibility"....or some such..<br>

Dear fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
Despite our friend EvMicks usual cynicism it must be remembered that the<br>
vast majority of election are fair and honest. It is a rare exception when<br>
there is so much tampering with the voting machines or the ballot box that<br>
an election has to be done over.<br>
In this situation -- and being more than slightly familiar with Mr.<br>
Dornan's past antics -- I suspect that he is spending an inordinate amount<br>
of time inventing a nice juicy conspiracy theory. He will, no doubt, be<br>
aided and abeted by his friends on the extreme right wing of the<br>
Republican Party and a scandal hungry media.<br>
<p>
Don't take it too seriously.<br>
