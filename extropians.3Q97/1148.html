In the abstract, of course you are right.  Where I would disagree with<br>
you is that your legislative activities pre-empt, and destroy the<br>
possibility of, people building their own safety nets together, and<br>
building a real sense of communal solidarity, with the money they would<br>
have had if you hadn't appropriated it from them in taxes.  Not to<br>
mention the fact that self-help builds self-esteem and the confidence to<br>
challenge abuse.<br>
<p>
Have you ever heard the story of the broken window, BTW?<br>
<p>
Dear Guru George and other fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
Actually, I have never heard the story of the broken window. Please<br>
enlighten me.<br>
<p>
Your thesis about self-actualizing safety nets is interesting and may even<br>
be valid to some extent. What concerns me, however, are all the people who<br>
lack the knowledge, skills and abilities to self-actualize themselves. The<br>
increase each year in the number of individual bankruptcys speaks for<br>
itself. <br>
<p>
Don't we have an obligation to help each other?<br>
<p>
Enjoy!!!<br>
