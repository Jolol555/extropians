Me and my exact copy and standing an equal distance from the center of <br>
a perfectly symmetrical room. A mad scientist presses the button on a magic  <br>
machine that he claims will instantaneously exchange my brain with that of my <br>
exact copy. He presses the button but I notice absolutely no difference, he <br>
says "that's because  the senses of the ordinal and the copy were sending the <br>
same signals to whatever brain happened to be in it's head". You are also <br>
present armed with CAT scans and MRI's and EEG's and high speed cameras and <br>
lots of other good stuff, but you can find no change when he presses the <br>
button either. Our loony friend says "that's because the two brains were<br>
identical, but really there was a huge change, I mean, after all, I exchanged <br>
the brains". I maintain that absolutely nothing is happening and if there is <br>
any difference between this man and a charlatan the difference is too small <br>
to be measured.  <br>
<p>
In 1690 the philosopher and co-inventor (with Newton) of The Calculus,  <br>
Gottfried Leibniz, wrote about something he called " The Identity Of <br>
Indiscernibles ". He said that things that you can measure are what's <br>
important, and if there is no way to find a difference between two things <br>
then they are identical, and switching the position of the objects does not <br>
change the physical state of the system. This idea has turned out to be of<br>
paramount importance in the scientific method, exchange forces in modern <br>
physics and The Pauli Exclusion Principle in particular could not be derived <br>
or understood without it.<br>
<p>
If objectively there is no difference and subjectively there is no difference <br>
then there is no difference, nothing is happening when the button is pressed <br>
and identity and consciousness can not be a function of position.<br>

I agree with that entirely, if they get different inputs they will start to <br>
diverge. I think that means survival is not a binary all or nothing matter. <br>
The 3 year old John Clark may not be completely dead but he's not as alive as <br>
the John Clark of today.                             <br>
