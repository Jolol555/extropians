I showed the thread on alternative energy sources to a friend of mine (Jamie<br>
Naizby), and he had the following comments:<br>
<p>
The person talking about hydrogen flammability limits was very likely confusing<br>
hydrogen in oxygen limits with hydrogen in AIR limits... two very different<br>
situations. Yes, flammability limits in OXYGEN are from 4.7 to 15 and 90 to 93.9<br>
with detonation limits in between (15 to 90% by volume) BUT this is good! It is<br>
one of the reasons it is a vastly superior fuel to all others in use now..<br>
The flammability limits of hydrogen in AIR are 4.0 to 18.2 and again above<br>
detonation limits at from 58.9 to 75%  with the 18.2 to 58.9% by volume zone<br>
between the detonation limits this is a fuel it has to burn to work. Propane<br>
in use everywhere with hardly anyone objecting has DETONATION limits from 2.1<br>
to 9.5 in AIR! (would prefer to use hydrogen)<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; Dear fellow Extropians,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The was a news item on the web several days ago that indicated that a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; German company (I believe it was Mercedes, but don't honestly recall.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; announced that they had developed a prototype fuel cell for automobiles.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; They further stated that they believed that it would replace the internal</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; combustion engine within the next decade. They claim that the fuel cell</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; uses hydrogen as is source of energy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Obviously, this is outside my area of expertise. I suspect, however, that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; there are those among you with substantially more technological knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; than I have who might understand the broad implications of this particular</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; development.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; My concern is with its impact on social, economic and international</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; relations initiatives.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Your thoughtful responses would be appreciated.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt;The Hydrogen must itself be generated, generally from a more</i><br>
<i>&gt;traditional energy source. Since you can use electricity to</i><br>
<i>&gt;generate the hydrogen, you can make fairly efficient and clean</i><br>
<i>&gt;use of just about anything, notably including nuclear power.</i><br>
<i>&gt;However, the result still depends on large centralized</i><br>
<i>&gt;power generation. You can convert the electricity to hydrogen</i><br>
<i>&gt;locally or even within the fuel cell itself, in which case the</i><br>
<i>&gt;fuel cell is essentially acting as a battery. Or, you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;try to convert to a "hydrogen economy", with distribution</i><br>
<i>&gt;of hydrogen via pipelines. This is a non-trivial excersize,</i><br>
<i>&gt;since hydrogen/air mixtures are explosive in any ratio</i><br>
<i>&gt;from 90%/10% to 10%/90%, and hydrogen molecules are very</i><br>
<i>&gt;tiny, requireing specialized pipes and joints.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you use coal or nukes, world energy potitics may change</i><br>
<i>&gt;dramatically. If you use oil-fired plants to generate</i><br>
<i>&gt;electricity, there's no big change at this level.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
