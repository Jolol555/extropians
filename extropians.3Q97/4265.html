<i>&gt;There seems to be a one in a million chance of a plutonium dispersal</i><br>
<i>&gt;accident into the biosphere, which would be the direct cause of 100 </i><br>

<p>
You say "deaths". Do you mean a 100 to 500 people will drop dead <br>
instantly? ... NO !!!   They will only die a little sooner. <br>
<p>
The real comparison should be made using the costs in "years per <br>
person". However not all years in a life are worth the same. <br>
I guess, for most people, the last years of their life (as an <br>
elderly person) are worth less than the years when in their prime<br>
health. And damage by radioactive causes will most likely result in<br>
cancer at an old age. This all makes the potential cost of the treat<br>
even smaller. <br>
<p>
(( And for people with vision, cancer (but not a brain tumor!!) will <br>
be much less disastrous than a stroke, because you should still <br>
be able to cryonically suspend your brain undamaged. Naturally, <br>
this cannot be used as a hard argument to the general <br>
(non-extropian) public. ;-&lt;&lt;&lt;        ))<br>
