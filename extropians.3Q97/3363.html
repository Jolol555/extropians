Well, one year and six trillion miles *are* the same thing.  He could have<br>
been a physicist, familiar with Special Relativity, who was trying to say that<br>
the change would result in either an advance in time or (better yet!) an<br>
advance in distance, but with the same amount of advance on some fundamental<br>
level.  And he was so used to thinking of "light-years" as a unit of distance<br>
that he didn't realize how silly the sentence started.  If you translate the<br>
sentence, it works out to:<br>
<p>
"This will put us years ahead, maybe trillions of miles ahead."<br>
<p>
Now, this sounds a bit out-of-context, but you can see how it might be<br>
meaningful if separate correspondences for distance&lt;-&gt;progress and<br>
time&lt;-&gt;progress had been established.  A year and six trillion miles are the<br>
same thing, after all, but one sounds much more impressive.<br>
<p>
Since an event trillions of miles away (in our frame of reference) can't<br>
affect us for years to come, he might have meant that there had been a huge<br>
leap in technology, which wouldn't have any immediate effects, but would<br>
result in a huge shock years down the road.  An advance in nanotechnology, for example.<br>
<p>
Or, moving light-years during a single advance (which presumably takes only a<br>
few months to develop) would require a large Tau factor, meaning that you were<br>
going close to the speed of light and time would slow down.  So he could be<br>
saying that the advance was moving very fast... or considering the other<br>
implications of high Tau, he could be saying that it was of massive<br>
importance.  Or since we *know* the advance is moving very fast, he could be<br>
saying that it's hard to pin down the position of the technology - a<br>
Heisenbergian thing.<br>
<p>
Of course, that would mean he only had a surface familiarity with Special<br>
Relativity, because otherwise he would know perfectly well that, even though<br>
it would seem like only a few months, it would also seem (from that frame of<br>
reference) that distances had contracted, so one would not have appeared to<br>
move light-years.  However, this apparent error could be a witty commentary on<br>
how quickly we acclimate, so that what was once the epitome of high technology<br>
seems old and stale.  After all, how can we move "years ahead" in just a few<br>
months?  In a few months, we move a few months ahead; the only faster progress<br>
is relative to our previous estimates, just as one can traverse light-years in<br>
months only from someone else's frame of reference.  This would also introduce<br>
the controversial concept that there is no absolute measurement of<br>
technological progress.<br>
<p>
Or, he could have meant it literally; traveling light-years in months within a<br>
single frame of reference.  Considering the Tau, he could be saying that the<br>
advance was really imaginary.  Or, if the speed of advance was continuous, he<br>
could be implying that for a few moments, the researchers were infinitely<br>
dense.  Or, since FTL travel allows global causality violation, he could be<br>
saying that this would give us a second chance at some previously botched<br>
effort.  Or he could simply be using it as a metaphor for a technology so<br>
strange it violates our concept of causality, or referring to stock-market<br>
speculation that would seem to put the effect before the cause.<br>
<p>
Or, considering that General Relativity causes the speed of light to change<br>
(as observed from another gravitational gradient), he could be implying that<br>
the technology was close to a singularity.  (Remember, earlier, how I<br>
suggested he could be talking about nanotechnological progress?)  Or, since<br>
this is General Relativity, he could be saying that everything is relative -<br>
or that the technological advance was relative *to* *a* *General*, meaning<br>
that it was a *military* advance.<br>
