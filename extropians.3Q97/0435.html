<p>
<i>&gt;How can you even ask the second question if you don't know that the first </i><br>

<p>
It doesn't matter if the first is true.  There would have to be a reason <br>
for travelling between solar systems before it would be done.  This will or <br>
has been the reason(s) 'WE' will do it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 'We' send out probes to other planets...why wouldn't another</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Which planet's intelligent life?</i><br>
<p>
Any planet's intelligent life.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; First, the Air Force's 'mogul' explanation's biggest problem for me is </i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; amount of material found (supposedly scattered for over a quarter of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; mile).</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And who, exactly, claimed it was scattered over quarter of a mile? I </i><br>
don't<br>
<i>&gt;have access to original documents, but I do have a cite for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;_Alberquerque Journal_, July 9 1947 claiming that the recovered object </i><br>
was<br>
<i>&gt;about three feet across... Hmm, odd, that's around about the size of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Mogul balloon's payload, isn't it? Bet it's just one of them coincidences. </i><br>
<p>
I *THINK* I read that as a quote from the official Air Force release (the <br>
first one, not the contraction).  It of course could be bogus.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Second, the Air Force has yet to explain the extreme security measures it </i><br>
<i>&gt; took to recover and dispose of this 'balloon'.  Even if it was a top </i><br>
secret<br>
<i>&gt; spy device a simple gathering of the wreckage of a 'weather balloon' and </i><br>
an<br>
<i>&gt; embarrassing apology for releasing a false report ('We have recovered a</i><br>
<i>&gt; flying saucer') would have sufficed.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's a black program, or the 40s equivalent; indeed, as far as I'm aware</i><br>
<i>&gt;it was part of the nuclear development programs (checking for radioactive</i><br>
<i>&gt;fallout from Russian bombs), and hence security would have been </i><br>
incredibly<br>
<i>&gt;tight. What do you expect them to do?</i><br>
<p>
Which brings up the question again...why weren't they actively searching <br>
for it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;BTW, you do realise that New Mexico was in the middle of a spate of</i><br>
<i>&gt;'flying disc' reports, don't you? Someone's collected together nine</i><br>
<i>&gt;newspaper reports of 'flying discs' from July 1st to July 11th, several </i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt;which were either parts of weather balloons or hoaxes. Don't you think</i><br>
<i>&gt;that in the circumstances it's not entirely surprising that that's how it</i><br>
<i>&gt;was first reported? I mean, after all, that's pretty much what the</i><br>
<i>&gt;balloon's payload looked like.</i><br>
<p>
I personally don't believe the skies are full of aliens.  I do believe <br>
aliens have visited.  May have been a million years ago or 100000 or 50 or <br>
just last week.  I'm not a 'beam me up I love aliens' fanatic.  I do know <br>
the government can lie.  That's what pisses me off.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Finally, how come no reference to aliens at Roswell was ever made</i><br>
<i>&gt;publically until more than thirty years later?</i><br>
<p>
I remember reading a book back in the 60's about Roswell that talked of <br>
captured aliens.  Dunno how many others before then.  I'm not a devotee of <br>
UFO's.<br>
