<p>
This may be so, but nonetheless, *you* and only you can know for<br>
sure *which* people you trust in this way, and in this "meta" sense,<br>
it's still you and no one else who knows what is best for you. You<br>
are the one who is choosing the authority that you study, at<br>
least once you've attained to adulthood, whatever that is (I'm<br>
an unabashed fan of Peter Pan, myself). <br>
<p>
Children usually stick with the default choice of their parents<br>
as the right authority figures to listen to, but if the parents<br>
screw up too much and lose their kids respect... it's usually<br>
tragic, which is more important than the fact that it's also a<br>
knotty problem in moral philosophy. Children's rights is a<br>
gnarly area, intellectually. It depends entirely too much on<br>
experiences and data that few people can think about objectively<br>
and dispassionately.<br>
<p>
But once you've hit the point where you've decided you are<br>
capable of finding your own authorities whom you are sure are<br>
more trustworthy than your parents (there's a provisional<br>
definition of "adulthood" for you), then you're on your own in<br>
terms of taking responsibility for your future ethical<br>
development.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; 	Here you are, apparently, at least partially, disagreeing</i><br>
<i> &gt; 	with my thinking that it might be ok for someone to force</i><br>
<i> &gt; someone to do something IF they know, absolutely, that that is what</i><br>
<i> &gt; is right for that person.  (i.e. a Mother knows a toddler should</i><br>
<i> &gt; not wander into a busy street and forcefully prevents them from</i><br>
<i> &gt; doing so.)</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it's interesting that you have to invoke the parent-child<br>
relationship in order to illustrate your notion of "absolute<br>
knowledge of what is good for someone else".  I doubt that it is<br>
possible for one adult to know absolutely what is good for any<br>
*other* adult. Unfortunately, this merely opens up room for debate<br>
about the definition of adulthood. I was fascinated by the<br>
distinction drawn in Linda Nagata's novel DECEPTION WELL: in the<br>
city of Silk, those over age 120 years or so are considered<br>
"real people", whereas those under that age are considered<br>
"ados" (a word derived from "adolescent").<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; So anyway, let me ask you a question I've been struggling</i><br>
<i> &gt; with about what the proper behavior should be.  Lets say</i><br>
<i> &gt; you have a very close loved one.  Say it is one of your children</i><br>
<i> &gt; or something.  Lets say he's about 17 years old and you know that</i><br>
<i> &gt; throughout his life he has consistently expressed a desire to not</i><br>
<i> &gt; be cryonically preserved </i><br>
<p>
The position that I was taking was that an expressed desire to<br>
commit suicide does not, by itself, constitute prima-facie evidence<br>
of insanity, and that an *adult* of sound mind who clearly expressed<br>
a desire not to be cryonically suspended after deanimation should<br>
not be forced into suspension. If you want to take this already<br>
fuzzy and difficult moral situation and mix into it questions of<br>
children's rights and parental responsibilities, then you're taking<br>
it way beyond my domain of expertise, since I'm over thirty and<br>
childless so far.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I ask anyone that is a better moral expert than I, what should</i><br>
<i> &gt; I do?</i><br>
<p>
I don't know for sure that there is any such thing as a moral<br>
expert. The notion makes me suspicious. The only moral experts I<br>
might trust are the ones who deny that they are moral experts.<br>
And even then only if they have a sense of humor.  ;)<br>
