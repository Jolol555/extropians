<p>
Or to put what I take to be your point slightly more (less?) bluntly: The<br>
problem is the way we assign "dumbness" to creatures as a way of<br>
justifying the otherwise problematic interventions we make in their lives. <br>
I am very interested in your turn to "manners" in the above formulation. <br>
As we contemplate the demise of the nation-state, and the disintegration<br>
of many of the institutions that exert material pressures to induce people<br>
to "behave," it becomes distressingly easy to imagine societies whose<br>
"proper" policing seems *un*imaginable.  The principal theme of Judith<br>
Martin's (a/k/a Miss Manners)  work is that the disintegration of manners<br>
fuels a disastrous rise of litigiousness in our society.  A more<br>
"extropian" spin on her thesis would worry, on the one hand, that the turn<br>
to litigiousness, however disastrous on the face of it, may not even be an<br>
available option in the near future, and, on the other hand, that if<br>
anything like a "singularity"  occurs it's hard to imagine how manners<br>
could provide any kind of intelligible alternative.  How do you make<br>
Powers feel ashamed of themselves?  Your discussion above is a step in the<br>
direction of thinking about these things, as is (in a slightly different<br>
way) your pondering of the effects of discussions of mehuman-to-transhuman<br>
sexuality for people of various sensibilities.  Anxieties about goo<br>
(especially the grey, the blue, and uber) also tend to provoke questions<br>
and discussions that tangle with this kind of trouble. The fraught and<br>
frustrating discussions of gender, race, and sexuality of a couple weeks<br>
back (and periodically before this) are another place where we think about<br>
these things.  I am very interested in other folks' visions of transhuman<br>
civility.<br>

<p>
I'm vegan to this day and have been for, let's see, just about four years<br>
now.  I get nervous about calling this a "pure" practice, but my reasons<br>
for the practice *are* as much about ethics as about keeping trim.  Seems<br>
to me that if I create -- intentionally or not -- beings with the kind of<br>
awareness that registers as intelligible to me (I have been accused of<br>
brutally ignoring the rich inner life of broccoli, for example), then I<br>
had best treat them as ends-in-themselves rather than means-to-my-ends in<br>
the good ol' Kantian manner.  I think it is a practice of ethical *self*-<br>
brutalization to make a habit of doing things that one knows to cause<br>
suffering.  Questions of ignorance of such consequences, and of necessary<br>
suffering in the face of irreconcilable ends are another discussion or<br>
two.  But in a nutshell, I for one think it would be potentially<br>
impoverishing to the greatest of Powers to imagine *anyone* on this list,<br>
e.g., was better used as nano feedstock than as a potential peer.  Now,<br>
how to spread this meme before the onslaught of singularity makes it<br>
*useful*? <br>

<p>
Isn't it "reasonably easy" to produce machines that do fabulously useful<br>
and complicated things with little more in the way of awareness than a<br>
bacterium?  If not, it's more likely the problem is not whether we should<br>
treat them as slaves but whether we can deal with them as superiors.  <br>
