I did reply to your original message, but several of my messages have<br>
vanished into limbo lately. However, we'd probably be less reliant on oil<br>
if the oil companies weren't able to get the government to steal money<br>
from the workers to pay to protect the oil supply. <br>
<p>
On the ICBM front, I suspect they'd be owned by anyone who wants one. I<br>
seem to be one of the few people on the list who feel that personal<br>
possession of nuclear weapons is a good thing, and resolves some of the<br>
area-defence arguments against anarchic or libertarian societies; nukes<br>
give rich individuals the power to destroy attacking armies by themselves. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are you going to give Nimitz-class carriers and stuff to Exxon?</i><br>
<p>
No, but they can buy them if they want them (of course they probably can't<br>
afford to, so they won't). <br>
<p>

<p>
I wasn't neccesarily implying that you're a communist, just pointing out<br>
that a free market allows the existence of communes of people who totally<br>
disagree with it, whereas communism won't allow people to 'drop out' into<br>
a free market.<br>
