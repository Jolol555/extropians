<i>&gt; &gt;From today's CNN headline <a href="news:">news:</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An analysis of more than 200 studies has concluded that a person's genes</i><br>
<i>&gt; account for only about half the factors that determine intelligence</i><br>
quotient,<br>
<i>&gt; or I.Q. The analysis suggests that conditions during prenatal</i><br>
development,<br>
<i>&gt; such as inadequate care, may play a more significant role than previously</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought. The findings, published in Thursday's issue of the journal</i><br>
Nature,<br>
<i>&gt; undercut the controversial 1994 book "The Bell Curve," which gave more</i><br>
weight<br>
<i>&gt; to genetics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Sure, prenatal conditions and upbringing will have their effect on things<br>
like intelligence (again: in the *broadest* sense of the word), but the<br>
original genetic programming is almost certainly the most important<br>
factor (by far). Various studies of uniovular twins have shown the dramatic<br>
similarities in both looks and personality. These people have <br>
almost exactly mirror lives, although they were brought up great distances<br>
apart, in different environments and with no contact with one another.<br>
Imo, this virtually shatters the idea of "free choice" and the<br>
"shapebility"<br>
of man. Is this covered in that book, "The Bell Curve", (I've never read it<br>
though I probably will now). I have no idea about the quality (quantity <br>
isn't everything) of those "200 studies" but I'd love to hear how they <br>
explain the twin parodox. Btw, I'm also sceptical of CNN's integrity and <br>
the timing of this "politically correct" news. The same people will<br>
probably tell you that x studies have proven that being gay is a "choice"<br>
instead of a genetic "disorder"...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And for my own part:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why waste time even discussing, much less attempting to justify, why some</i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals treat some other individuals badly?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Because that's what we do here: wasting our time with discussion<br>
while the world goes to hell. But hey, it's fun and and least now I<br>
know what the contents of a lavalamp are :)<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
