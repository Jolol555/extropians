Nope, but that's what Heinlein thought he had said when asked later (the<br>
"veteran" quote). There is a theory that he was so pissed off by events of<br>
the day (the test ban, among other things) that he banged it out and<br>
shipped it off without a second pass. It is possible he meant to include<br>
what we think of as general "government service" as an option, but it's<br>
not what the book itself says.<br>
<p>
The actual text never says bureaucratic work is an option--The<br>
induction MD is a civilian contractor who tells Johnny the options are <br>
"military duty, or a most unreasonable facsimile"--meaning, I take it,<br>
that whatever you're doing to get the vote is still something entailing <br>
significant risk to your life--"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."<br>
<p>
Being a smoke jumper, say. Or a Coast Guard helicopter rescue swimmer on<br>
*frequent* call. Hazardous duty. With all training being, just like the<br>
MI boot camp, "made as tough as possible, and for a very good reason."<br>
