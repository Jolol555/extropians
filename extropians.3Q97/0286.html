<i>&gt;      Learning without hope</i><br>
<p>
It is hard to understand why "violence" is the specific ill said to<br>
follow from violating these principles.  I could see that some of them<br>
might lead to unhappiness or disappointment, but a lot more would have<br>
to go wrong before violence would result.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From an individualist perspective, these are not "blunders of the world."</i><br>
Some of them may be unwise practices for individuals.  Although they<br>
are expressed in the language of conventional morality, there may be<br>
something there that we can use.  Let me try to go beyond the conventional<br>
interpretation of some of these items, and see what they could usefully<br>
say to extropians:<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;      * Wealth without work</i><br>
<p>
If you have a lot of wealth, and just sit around and enjoy it all the<br>
time, there is a good chance that ultimately your lifestyle is going<br>
to seem boring and pointless.  For most people, having a challenge, a<br>
goal, a chance for improvement, is an important part of a happy life.<br>
(Note, there may be some people for whom this is not true, and who really<br>
are satisfied just enjoying a pleasant lifestyle.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      * Pleasure without conscience</i><br>
<p>
Conscience represents your suppressed knowledge of problems in your<br>
current situation.  If your conscience is bothering you, it's because<br>
at some level you believe you should be doing something different, but<br>
you are trying to ignore it.  In this sense, the advice is valid: be<br>
aware of the full ramifications of what you are doing.  Look at the<br>
long term consequences of your actions.  Don't just ignore problems,<br>
hoping they will go away; do something about them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      * Knowledge without character</i><br>
<p>
I interpret this as distinguishing between "book" or theoretical knowledge,<br>
and "character", which is learned through actual experience with the real<br>
world.  It's a common mistake to think that the first can be a substitute<br>
for the second.  (Another mistake is to think that the second can be a<br>
substitute for the first, people who have practical experience but refuse<br>
to believe that theoretical analysis has any value.)  This advises us<br>
to test our theories against reality, to go out and interact with the<br>
world.  This is an important source of information and learning which<br>
some people ignore.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      * Commerce without morality</i><br>
<p>
Think of this as another recommendation to look at long term consequences<br>
of actions.  It may seem attractive to cheat or shave some corners in a<br>
commercial interaction, but in the long run this will hurt your reputation<br>
and interfere with success.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      * Science without humanity</i><br>
<p>
This could be seen as advice to think through the full consequences of<br>
implementing a new technology.  "Humanity" really refers to the world as<br>
a whole as it is impacted by a scientific advance.  Don't burn down your<br>
rain forest land so you can grow wheat without thinking about whether<br>
it may hold valuable pharmaceuticals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      * Worship without sacrifice</i><br>
<p>
This is really advice to avoid hypocrisy.  If you think of yourself as<br>
a worshiper, you should make your actions suit your thoughts.  Actually<br>
worshiping will require some sacrifice.<br>
<p>
More generally, it is easy to fall into the trap of believing that<br>
thoughts are as good as actions.  An example would be someone who<br>
thinks of himself as taking steps to improve his life just by reading<br>
mailing lists.   Unconsciously he identifies with the progress being<br>
made by other people on the list, and he thinks he is improving himself<br>
in that same way.  But actually he is not making the real effort and<br>
real sacrifices which are necessary to move forward.<br>
<p>
We see this a lot in the cryonics community.  There are people who think<br>
cryonics is a good idea and can work, and even think of themselves as<br>
being in a position to receive the benefits of the technology, except that<br>
they haven't actually signed up to have the procedure done!  Taking that<br>
extra step is the costly one in time and effort, and it's surprising<br>
how many people don't do it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      * Politics without principle </i><br>
<p>
The idea here is consistency.  Politicians without principle change with<br>
the latest opinion poll or lobbyist contribution.  They end up moving on<br>
a random walk through position space, and don't accomplish much.<br>
<p>
By adopting principles and following them, you coordinate the actions in<br>
your life so you are moving generally in a consistent direction.  Align<br>
your goals with your principles and they will be that much easier to<br>
attain.<br>
<p>
<p>
I won't try to go on and do the other ones.  The technique should be clear.<br>
The real point is not to reject this kind of advice just because it is<br>
cloaked in the language of conventional morality, or offered by someone<br>
who is perhaps approaching issues from a very different direction than<br>
your own.  Often if you look a little deeper you will find common ground.<br>
<p>
Hal<br>
<p>
P.S.  Curiously, reversing several of these points makes them equally valid<br>
IMO, and often more extropian:<br>
<p>
 * Work without wealth<br>
	People should work with the goal of significant rewards.  Sacrifice,<br>
	save, so that you are improving your financial picture.<br>
 * Conscience without pleasure<br>
	Don't be so focused on the big picture that you forget to enjoy<br>
	the happy moments.<br>
 * Character without knowledge<br>
	Explained above - don't scorn the boys in the ivory tower.<br>
 * Morality without commerce<br>
	Ethical and honest behavior is good, but you can't ignore the reality<br>
	that work is necessary to survive.  This also emphasizes the<br>
	importance of the division of labor and cooperative commercial<br>
	agreements in terms of benefiting everyone.<br>
 * Humanity without science<br>
	Without science and technology we are little better than animals.<br>
