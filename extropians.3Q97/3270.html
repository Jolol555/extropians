     <br>
     See The Tobacco Industry in the early part of this century in the U.S. <br>
     and elsewhere on the planet in recent times.  <br>
     <br>
     I would say that excess has been reached when the marketplace, big on <br>
     desire and short on information and wisdom, is given the free will to <br>
     slowly kill themselves and debilitate the community at large, <br>
     impacting health care costs and productivity.<br>
     <br>
     And then EvMick quoted Voltaire:<br>
     <br>
     Whoever has power in his hands wants to be despotic; the craze for<br>
     domination is an incurable disease.<br>
     <br>
     Rick responds:<br>
     <br>
     I regard the inclination to be a despot decreases in accordance with <br>
     an increase of information and a lack of fear unless you are a <br>
     sociopath.  In that case, all bets are off.  Besides, it's hard to <br>
     give any viable weight to something that was said at the infancy of <br>
     the Industrial Age (that still echoed Agrarian age influence) when we <br>
     are preparing to eclispse it in this one.<br>
