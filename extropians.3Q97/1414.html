First a disclaimer: among the few things I disapprove of are<br>
sanctimony and racism. Now that we have a nice little<br>
double-bind framing this discussion such that sides cannot be<br>
chosen without contextually incriminating oneself as either (a)<br>
sanctimonious (den Otter's charge) or (b) racist (Broderick's<br>
charge), I'd like to keep my own name out of the heart of this<br>
particular debate. (Now I will no doubt be identified as (c)<br>
cowardly.)<br>
<p>
However, I do want to pick at a flaw in one of den Otter's<br>
central arguments.<br>
<p>
den Otter asks:<br>
<i> &gt; Now about the meme thing: do you honestly belief that "all memes</i><br>
<i> &gt; are equal"? If so, why aren't you over at Christian chat or </i><br>
<i> &gt; Commytalk?  After all...it's all the same thing.</i><br>
<p>
All memes might very well be equal without that fact causing any<br>
desire in me to slurp up the tasty memes of Christians and communists.<br>
These memes *might* just be well-suited to their current hosts<br>
while remaining virulently poisonous to me. Even the historical<br>
effects of these memes on host populations over long periods of<br>
time is, as they say in investment circles, no guarantee of future<br>
performance. Although the hardcore individual Christians and<br>
communists may try to fight the processes of cultural evolution,<br>
Christianity and communism are not under anyone's control, and they<br>
are no more fixed and static than any other set of living memes.<br>
The socialists took over the word "liberal", which has not yet lost<br>
its pleasant ring to my ear, even though I can no longer self-apply<br>
the word without guarding against being misunderstood as a socialist.<br>
And a socialist is, to my way of thinking, the very opposite of<br>
what the word "liberal" meant in the first full flowering of world<br>
liberalism.  Perhaps the word "Christian" will undergo similar<br>
strange transmogrifications over the next century.<br>
<p>
The inequality of people is not as significant as the champions of<br>
the idea of inequality would make it seem, because people cannot<br>
be readily ranked into bins, and attempts to stratify society along<br>
these basis always develop into ridiculous fictions. A superintelligence<br>
who recognized eirself as such at the age of, say, seven years,<br>
might profitably hide the fact from the perception of others, the<br>
better to reshape the world into eir heart's desire. Any attempt<br>
to seriously consider possibilities of this sort rapidly veer off<br>
into the sheerest of plausibility arguments. I do think it is<br>
important that human inequality be recognized to allow us to continue<br>
to resist the eternal attempts to punish the skillful for the "crime"<br>
of being skillful, a la Vonnegut's Harrison Bergeron.<br>
<p>
I think each person ought to be allowed to make eir own assessments<br>
of the relative "value rank" of other people, so I am generally<br>
opposed to antidiscrimination legislation. But as long as powerful<br>
governments, permitted by social assumptions to use force against<br>
individuals, share this planet with my friends, I will resist the<br>
idea that the relative value rank of individual human beings can<br>
be reliably and objectively measured. And as a matter of taste, I<br>
will continue to avoid the company of those who believe that there<br>
are any shortcuts to the assessment of the general worth of a human<br>
being that can be explained in a paragraph.<br>
