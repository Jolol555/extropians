     Brent Allsop wrote (recalling an exchange with his Mormon family):<br>
     <br>
     I can (without being to much of an obnoxious pain), say<br>
     things like: "In a thousand years we'll know who is right, who made<br>
     the right choice, who is alive in a glorious, eternal life, heaven and<br>
     who is miserable in hell, sheo, or the grave."  <br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     With all due respect, it takes little reading between the lines to see <br>
     that your religious upbringing has you by the short hairs.  The rather <br>
     dubious challenge "In a thousand years we'll know who is right" falls <br>
     about as intellectually and motivationally flat as the religious <br>
     rhetoric I continue to get from my "dog and pony show" religious <br>
     relatives.  <br>
     <br>
     You've essentially turned the tables on the religiously devout.  They <br>
     used to point and judge and wring out the cliches about eternal life.  <br>
     Mothers would worry, fathers disapprove.  But now, the extropian spin <br>
     casts as much pity (or indifference) on the "cryonically challenged" <br>
     &lt;G&gt;.  Sounds like one-upmanship.  <br>
     <br>
     A more reasonable and benevolent response to your family's concern <br>
     (although we are almost auto-triggered to take our family members on <br>
     so I *do* understand the instinct) is that you have chosen your plans <br>
     for eternity just as they have chosen theirs.  You each think the <br>
     other is sadly misguided so what the hell?  If you love them, love <br>
     them while you're both here and now.  Carping over proof that will <br>
     show up a millenium from now can't possibly matter a damn except as a <br>
     feeble attempt to bolster one's ego.  I say this from my own tiring <br>
     experience trying to argue down southern baptists who disapprove of <br>
     same-sex relations.  I am older and (hopefully) wiser.  They can <br>
     believe what they want and as long as they don't interfere with my <br>
     life, they can conjur up any tweaked belief system they please.  Just <br>
     remember, the conjuring isn't exclusive to the traditionally <br>
     religious.<br>
