<i>&gt;      My largest incongruity with the classic Extropian viewpoint (as</i><br>

<i>&gt;      anyone who has ever personally been with a group of Extropians</i><br>

<i>&gt;      </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Hopefully, I have not snipped out of context here in getting to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;      point.  My initial quote above seems to be resurfacing in new posts, </i><br>
<i>&gt;      if only for the purpose of tweakin the vocabulary &lt;G&gt;.  However, it </i><br>
<i>&gt;      was not my intention to be malicious.  And as word choices, I had </i><br>
<i>&gt;      hoped to disarm that interpretation by use of the word "seeming".  </i><br>
<i>&gt;      </i><br>
<i>&gt;      I consider extropians very intelligent and gifted people.  It is my </i><br>
<i>&gt;      perception that there are more of what I would classify "engineering" </i><br>
<i>&gt;      mentalities than there are say..."liberal arts" mentalities.</i><br>
<p>
hmmm... this seems awfully simplistic, to the point of being entirely<br>
useless.  How do you differentiate the two?  By educational background?<br>
<p>
Since Engineering is a practical subset of Science, and Science is a<br>
subset of Philosophy, and Philosophy is an Art, I have a really hard time<br>
making any distinction between your two "mentalities" whatsoever.<br>
<p>
The creativity involved in forming a hypothesis is an art in itself.<br>
<p>
So maybe what I'm saying is that by being a scientist, your are by default<br>
an artist.  Does it work the other way around?  Maybe not.  You tell me.<br>
You are the "liberal artist."<br>
<p>
<p>
I think the "artist vs. scientist" meme should be eliminated here and now.<br>
It's way too binary for my brain.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;      Of </i><br>
<i>&gt;      course, my speaking emerges from the latter category as anyone who's </i><br>
<i>&gt;      read anything I've posted here can readily interpret.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;      </i><br>
<i>&gt;      I know each group can't survive (well) without the other.  We are </i><br>
<i>&gt;      polarized but dependent on one another.  A yin/yang, right-brain, </i><br>
<i>&gt;      left-brain, positive/negative, zero/one opposites attract type of </i><br>
<i>&gt;      thing.  When the artsy-fartsy types (like moi) get too out there, I </i><br>
<i>&gt;      often NEED someone to say "Earth to Rick".  When the calculating, </i><br>
<i>&gt;      empirical types reach their version of critical mass, they too need </i><br>
<i>&gt;      some reconnection from "the other side".  </i><br>
<p>
Empricism and artistic creativity are two entirely compatible<br>
philosophies, even in the same person!  I'm sure you can tell yourself<br>
"Earth to Rick", instead of relying on someone else.  Inversely, I think I<br>
can draw some pretty pictures without your help ;)  <br>
      <br>
<i>&gt;      This is staring to sound like Rodney King asking why we can't get </i><br>
<i>&gt;      along.  I think we do merge and interpolate well and the occasional </i><br>
<i>&gt;      "disturbance in the force" here in this digest is of no cause for </i><br>
<i>&gt;      alarm to me and hopefully to no one else.  </i><br>
<p>
I think you are making a distinction that is not really there.<br>
      <br>
<i>&gt;      Humanity and compassion are not simply defined when you have so many </i><br>
<i>&gt;      "subjective realities" to factor in &lt;G&gt;.  This digest is an </i><br>
<i>&gt;      EXTRO-ordinary melting pot of ideas and perspectives.  I say it's </i><br>
<i>&gt;      great.  I've learned much and hopefully contributed much.  I'd like to </i><br>
<i>&gt;      make a living doing this and am paving the way for me to do so.</i><br>
<p>
Me, too!  Isn't it exciting?<br>
