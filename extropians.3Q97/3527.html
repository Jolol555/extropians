Hi!<br>
<p>
Since this is not exactly about cryopreservation, I've decided to send<br>
another message.<br>
<p>

'basic ones'? If aging was a result of 'basic' errors, evolution would<br>
soon had found a way to prevent aging which is not the case for our<br>
species.<br>
The genome is finite but there are theories that claim all genes as<br>
pleiotropic or having more than one function at the same time. We are<br>
incredibly complex organisms with enormous interactions between all our<br>
genes. I think that seeing the aging process as individual genetic<br>
errors is a mistake. There is a gene that codes immunity to malaria but,<br>
at the same time, can (if it is homozygous) provoke sickle-cell which is<br>
a terrible disease. This reminds me of environmental changes, you solve<br>
a problem but immediately create a new one so complex are the<br>
connections between species at their niches. Our genome is the same<br>
thing, you might fix an error on it to later find out that you just made<br>
yourself impotent.<br>
Also, there are certainly lethal genes that are active when you are,<br>
say, 200 years old and you will have to deal with them too with the only<br>
difference being the fact than no-one even knows they exist. Say, as a<br>
practical example, the CJD (human mad cow disease). It is caused by<br>
accumulating defective proteins that usually take decades to act.<br>
Proteins might (and, IMHO, certainly) exist that take centuries to<br>
accumulate before they kill you and these are the diseases that you will<br>
have to deal in the future. Errors will always happen.<br>
Going back to cryopreservation, this futuristic lethal genes are a good<br>
reason to pursue successful cryopreservation. That way the first ones to<br>
witness the effects of this lethal genes would be cryopreservated until<br>
a cure was to be found.<br>
<p>
I could go on forever, the best way is for you to read my "Why are We<br>
Allowed to Age?" article in my site at<br>
<a href="http://mithlond.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/science/why.htm">http://mithlond.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/science/why.htm</a><br>
(actually you won't be able to read it, like I mention ahead)<br>
<p>
What is getting trapped in a loop? Perhaps it's my English but I don't<br>
seem to understand what are you saying?<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; BTW, I can't access your essay or your homepage, please check the</i><br>
<i>&gt; read permissions on your files. </i><br>
<p>
I'm terribly sorry, I even sent you an e-mail asking you to check out my<br>
site for, perhaps, a link in your own page and my site isn't working.<br>
It's not my fault, it's my server's fault, I hope it's fixed at the<br>
beginning of next week. Also my site's address should change to<br>
<a href="http://homepage.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/">http://homepage.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/</a><br>
but only next week I'll be sure. Sorry once again.<br>
