Just a quick comment on this Rockefeller business.  I've read that<br>
Rockefeller used the tactics of trying to pressure his competitors<br>
into selling out to him by undercutting them and then offering to<br>
buy their businesses while they were in distress.  This set up an<br>
arms race: several small-time oil operators caught on to what<br>
Rockefeller was up to, and began to start up new oil businesses,<br>
investing little or no capital in them, letting him lose money for<br>
a while by undercutting them, and then selling them to Rockefeller<br>
for far more than they were worth.  I don't have any cites to the<br>
primary literature on this (and I only read about it in secondary<br>
literature, so I don't know how reliable the story is).  And of<br>
course, just as Rockerfeller's smalltime competition caught on to<br>
what Rockerfeller was up to and took advantage of it, Rockefeller<br>
probably only got burned a few times before he realized what was<br>
going on.<br>
<p>
My point is that markets are shapeshifting creatures, and however<br>
awesome the power of a monopoly may be, the power of the government<br>
is even more awesome.  I'd prefer to see people fight monopolies<br>
with the same sorts of tactics that are used to build up monopolies,<br>
the way those smalltime competitors of Rockefeller purportedly did.<br>
IMHO, the monopolies instituted and protected by governments nearly<br>
always do more damage than the spontaneously emerging natural<br>
monopolies.  If you want to fight monopoly, it would be better to<br>
try to get the government to stop prohibiting people from competing<br>
in the delivery of first-class mail and other transportation,<br>
communication, and power services (usually monopolized by government<br>
fiat the world over) than to lobby for the government to intervene<br>
in the business of a company that has never received any kind of<br>
special treatment from the government.  Microsoft certainly have<br>
*far* less on their consciences than the RBOCs, the power companies,<br>
and the various PTT agencies on the planet do.<br>
<p>
(Perhaps I'm being too harsh on the RBOCs to counter any natural<br>
prejudice arising from the fact that I'm currently working as a<br>
contract programmer for Pacific Bell.  ;)  I'm only in it for the<br>
money, so maybe I'm far more guilty than Bill Gates of profiting<br>
from monopolistic practices.)<br>
