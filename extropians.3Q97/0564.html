There are many people who argue that this is already happening.  Tom<br>
Malone, and his MIT Center for Coordination Science (<a href="http://ccs.mit.edu/">http://ccs.mit.edu/</a>),<br>
think that networked information technology (what we're all usin' here) is<br>
enabling more market-like business structures to replace hierarchical ones.<br>
 It's most obvious manifestation is more outsourcing and the rise in<br>
individual consulting, which is what I do.  You also see more large<br>
businesses breaking into independant profit&amp;loss units.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I see this as a possibility, companies could be considered a group of equally</i><br>

<i>&gt;near future due to automation.</i><br>
<p>
Mind you, it might be my management hat talking, but I don't think it will<br>
move in the direction you describe.  There may not be bosses and workers,<br>
but there will still be customers and vendors.  Think of the independant<br>
consultant model again.  When I consult for Company B, the designer or<br>
producer isn't my boss, but they decide what they want me to produce for<br>
them (though likely with advice from me), and if I agree then I am<br>
contractually obligated to produce that.  And I want to, because it will<br>
lead to repeat business and a good reputation.  On the other hand, if I<br>
have lots of clients and I am not happy with how Comany B worked, then I<br>
can turn them down the next time they have a project.<br>
<p>
The idea isn't to eliminate forces and incentives.  Right now we have<br>
hierarchical structures that opperate within a market environment.  They<br>
say:  "we pay you a yearly salary, so you have to do whatever I say or quit<br>
and find another job".  (Mind you, here in Silicon Valley, competition for<br>
software professionals is so fierce that the answer to this is often "OK, I<br>
quit".)  You could replace the hierarchical structure with a market<br>
structure, where they say "I'll pay you $X for x work, $Y if you do y, and<br>
nothing if you do z, and you get a cut of the profits from A if we finish<br>
it".  What you need are systems that allow us to define x, y, and z clearly<br>
enough that disputes can be resolved.<br>
<p>
(You also need systems that allow the customer to coordinate the schedules<br>
and products of many different vendors, and to choose between cost and<br>
quality of various potential vendors.  That's what Tom talks about.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To take this a step further: Could these ideas also be applied to education,</i><br>
<i>&gt;an anarchic schooling system?</i><br>
<p>
David Friedman has an essay in Machinery of Freedom on a anarcho-capitalist<br>
education system.  You should check that out, though it's mostly applied to<br>
college.  Personally, I would love to see a world where 18 year olds could<br>
get reasonable jobs without going to annother four years of school.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I believe this is also possible.  Given that pupils have sufficient</i><br>
<i>&gt;motivation to work, generally they are more likely to work in a looser</i><br>
<i>&gt;system.  Freedom to work at your own pace and to form orders and groups</i><br>
<i>&gt;spontaneously in order to complete set goals could improve education</i><br>
<i>&gt;immensely.</i><br>
<p>
You have a bit more faith in this approach than I do.  Evaluations of<br>
"Schools without Walls" here in the US have been mixed at best, and hard to<br>
separate from the effect of having higher-quality teachers at the<br>
experimental schools.  There are many students who need a fair amount of<br>
structure to acheive, myself included.  What I'd rather see is a variety of<br>
types of learning environments, so parents and students could choose the<br>
approach that worked best for them.<br>
<p>
What's the hardest problem I see?  It's the same one as in the<br>
market-structured company: how do you define the output?  Imagine briefly<br>
that schools don't exist to warehouse teenagers and keep them off the<br>
streets in their most violent age period.  Instead that diploma is a<br>
certificate that promises that the student has completed the program at a<br>
school with a given reputation, and the transcript describes roughly how<br>
well the student did.  This is then used by the student when talking to<br>
potential employers as evidence of their aptitude and knowledge in certain<br>
areas.<br>
<p>
So, in an anarchic (or market-like) school, what do you have to show the<br>
employers?  You need something more consise that the entire portfolio of<br>
work, and you'd like something that helps them rank you in relation to<br>
other applicants.  The option our federal government like is to create one<br>
Great Standard Tesk of All Knowledge, but that's likely to dictate how<br>
children are made to learn and doesn't help in specialized fields.  I'd<br>
rather start thinking from the employer's perspective, of what they need to<br>
know.  Any ideas?<br>
