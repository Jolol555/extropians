My experiences differ from this. I once saw a grain of sand about the<br>
size of a car, albeit in an altered state. Yes, I knew it was a grain of<br>
sand, but the size parameter was obviously altered. I suspect at that<br>
moment more of my neurons were into the sand grain than into the rest of<br>
my visual field. <br>
