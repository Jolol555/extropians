THE PRIMARY QUESTION of logical inquiry <br>
Must be "what is identity?" Until we answer <br>
That question, all other inquiry is illogical.  <br>
<p>
A thing, a state of difference, A, is an identity.  <br>
<p>
Every identity is derived from relation.  <br>
There is no identity that is not derived from relation.  <br>
There can be no identity that is not derived from relation.  <br>
<p>
Therefore "relation" cannot be separated from "identity,"  <br>
And therefore, as relation contains both A and not-A, <br>
What a thing is said not to be cannot truthfully <br>
Be separated from what it is said to be.  <br>
<p>
The assumed separation of A and not-A is therefore <br>
A fallacy. If A is not separate from not-A, <br>
Then A is not-A: <br>
<p>
  A = not-A <br>
<p>
If there is nothing A is not, A is everything.  <br>
If A is everything, A is no thing, A is nothing, <br>
And thus everything is nothing... Logical Zen.<br>
<p>
So the answer to the primary question as to the nature <br>
Of identity is that identity is nothing,  identity is <br>
False where it assumes separation, and that is true.  <br>
Identity is not identity, different is same.<br>
<p>
Separation does not exist. <br>
No thing is apart from the whole. <br>
Every thing is the whole. <br>
Everything is whole.<br>
