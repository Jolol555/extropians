The "psychological-type" mechanisms involved in subjecting<br>
people to religion and statism are very similar.  In both<br>
cases people are induced by very secific language to accept<br>
certain illusions -- illusions some of which most people,<br>
including many libertarians, anarchists, and atheists -- still<br>
cling to, usually without realizing it.<br>

The aim of the two-tribes story was to illustrate some of<br>
these "psychological-type" mechanisms.<br>

(by Christopher S. Hyatt. Ph.D.)<br>
<p>
As an aphorism, RAW encapsulates the "psychological-type" mechanisms<br>
I'm talking about.<br>
<p>
Among other things, the spooks in peoples' heads tend to reduce their<br>
ability to make rational decisions concerning many areas of life.  The<br>
spooks tend to drastically reduce the range of options people think<br>
they have available to them.<br>
<p>
With the NSPIC debate we seek to learn more about identifying the<br>
exact spooks and discovering how to do whatever necessary so people<br>
can clear the spooks from their heads.<br>
<p>
One of the points I tried to convey with the "royalty" illusion<br>
post is that the spooks used to induce the "royalty" illusion<br>
include words like "royal," "commoner," "king," "queen," etc. --<br>
*spooks created by language*, as indicated by RAW.<br>
<p>
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET RID OF THE ILLUSION WITHOUT RECLASSIFYING<br>
ALL THE SPOOK-WORDS CONCERNED AS *INVALID*.<br>
