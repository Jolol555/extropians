I was amazed at the 10.000 dollars/kidney black market value, if you<br>
compare to crimes with similar risks, like a hit job, and add the price for<br>
the medical expertise required, plus the fact that more than 1 person is<br>
comitting the crime, and is exposed to the same danger of punishment for<br>
it. I think you'd end up at a figure at least 10 times as high. I think the<br>
story has some weaknesses on the supply side as well. <br>
<p>
btw, i can't imagine many high payed medical dr's, risking their<br>
comfortable way of life...<br>
