Found in _Rogue Queen_ (1951), a novel by Sprague de Camp:<br>
<p>
	The Terrans had spread a dead leipag [native animal] out on <br>
	the ground and taken the beast thoroughly apart. ... Bloch was<br>
	removing all the muscles and organs ....  Every few seconds he<br>
	stopped to dictate notes to Barbe, or to tell her to draw a<br>
	sketch or point a camera at the remains ....<br>
<p>
If that were written after 1980, Bloch wouldn't have a human assistant:<br>
he'd have a head-mounted camera, which responds to coded movements of<br>
his jaw or eyelids, and a microphone feeding either an AI or a tape.<br>
<p>
Anybody want to improve my guess of 1980 as the transition date?<br>
