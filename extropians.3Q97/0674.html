As far as I can tell, it is possible that the Neanderthals couldn't talk, or<br>
at least not nearly as well as we could.  They might, for exmple, have had a<br>
vocabulary of a few hundred words, and a grammar that only allowed two-word<br>
sentences.  This is a stage in the development of human language that kids<br>
spend some time in around age two, whch allows sentences of the forms "gimme<br>
juice", "go house", "brown dog", etc.  It's a long way from real language,<br>
albeit a huge advance over no language at all.  It may well not be enough to<br>
support a culture that permits the development and appreciation of art.<br>
<p>
That's my cockamamie theory of why the Neaderthals lost out.  For another<br>
theory, possibly less cockamamie since it was come up with by an<br>
archaeologist after much thought, I reccommend "The Prehistory of the Mind"<br>
by Steven Mithen.  It's a theory on the cognitive architecture of the minds<br>
of the hominids, based on archeological evidence.  It's fairly cool stuff<br>
and may even be right.  It's a well-written book.<br>
<p>
My 19-month-old daughter can speak three human words (juice, me, and done)<br>
and four animal sounds (woof-woof, sssss, baa, and moo).  And we don't have<br>
pets or live on a farm; this all from looking at books and occaisional zoo<br>
visits.  Mithen claims that there is a part of the brain specialized to the<br>
learning of facts about plants and animals, and it's easy to believe when I<br>
watch my daughter learn stuff about animals faster than she learns about<br>
things our culture considers important (talking, cleanliness, fairness...).<br>

PS.  She's also obsessed with trains, which I think file under 'animals' in<br>
her brain.  When we drive around, she spots railroad crossings out the<br>
window and points them out with great excitement.  If trains were animals,<br>
she'd be spotting game trails.  All this from someone who poops at random<br>
and frequently trips over specks of dust!<br>
