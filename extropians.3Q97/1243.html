In a message dated 97-07-28 02:34:36 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; "never ascribe to conspiracy what can be<br>
 satisfactorily explained by stupidity." &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Ain't it the truth.  Who said" you'l never go broke betting on human<br>
stupidity" and such like?  I think that is actually the basis for relegion.<br>
 We WANT someone to be in charge...badly...and we see things going to hell in<br>
a handbasket all around us ...it's too depressing to think that people could<br>
be SOOOO stupid....so we invent a bogie man to blame it on...thus relegion.<br>
