<i>&gt;      this prompted a philosophical question of why/how could he be ME?  Why </i><br>
<i>&gt;      am I considering that I am not the isolated individual, but part of a </i><br>
<i>&gt;      continuum where we are just beginning to free exchange ideas, energy </i><br>
<i>&gt;      and contribution?  </i><br>
<p>
I've been there, I've wondered that. I am the sun on my face, for without<br>
it I would cease to be. I am my friends, for without them I would not be<br>
who I am. Every time communication occurs, the boundary between self and<br>
other blurs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      body which seems to curiously change from year to year.  Freezing my </i><br>
<i>&gt;      body (or even more whimsically, my head) seems a rather quaint notion. </i><br>
<p>
Speaking only for myself, getting frozen is the second worst thing that<br>
could happen to me. Most afterlife stories seem rather quaint to me.<br>
But I try to remember that from the right vantage point, all adjectives<br>
are "quaint"... they tell much more about the observer than the observed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       Does extropian thinking focus so much on the physically proven and </i><br>
<i>&gt;      sound as to consider this the most preferable and viable solution to </i><br>
<i>&gt;      achieving "immortality"?  </i><br>
<p>
Again, speaking only for myself, the best way to achieve immortality (in<br>
Woody Allen's words) is by not dying.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, I believe there are some things worth dying for--and<br>
that these things include finding out "what's next"--IF such is your<br>
desire.<br>
<p>
Paradoxically, I find myself worrying a lot less about my eventual<br>
demise, and my place in the cosmos, since signing up. It's like "Well,<br>
that's handled about as well as I can manage (as long shots go)... now<br>
what is my _life_ about?"<br>
<p>
It _is_ a long shot. Absolutely. I can do very little about the state of<br>
the preservation-of-self art when/if I get frozen; my focus is on helping<br>
create a world, as I mentioned in another post, that satisfies my two<br>
"least criteria":<br>
1) a world that I wouldn't mind coming back to, and <br>
2) a world that wouldn't mind bringing me back.<br>
<p>
Oddly enough, helping create such a world seems to imply living a<br>
virtuous, possibly even Christlike, life. And when I'm doing my best, I<br>
don't mind that much if I don't come back. "A good day to die", in the<br>
overused Native American phrase.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As a mental exercise, I wonder what </i><br>
<i>&gt;      discoveries of the essence, the unforseen would radically change such </i><br>
<i>&gt;      notions?  That which is beyond the horizon where the fishermen's wives </i><br>
<i>&gt;      are no longer visible from the shore and you are going on gut instinct </i><br>
<i>&gt;      and conviction.</i><br>
<p>
Consider cryonics as a transport protocol: in time, rather than in space.<br>
If bringing someone back someday costs about what a Life Flight medevac<br>
helicopter ride and an overnight stay in a hospital costs today (say, $10k<br>
total)--why *not* do it? The Golden Rule is a *good* I-and-thou myth.<br>
<p>
If it's ever _proven_ that recovering _the person_, whatever that turns<br>
out to be, is a fundamental impossibility... Well, I bet a lousy $100k<br>
insurance policy and a dollar a day for my cryonics society membership, <br>
and I "lost". No big deal, some people spend more on exotic vacations or<br>
powdering their noses. And if I really died _dead_ anyway, then the <br>
Cosmic Whatsis had its way with me, no? Om shanti.<br>
<p>
Now, there's a bare possibility that getting frozen will result in my<br>
becoming a "ghost", unable fully to participate in Whatever Comes Next,<br>
but if the pull of the Cosmic Whatsis is that powerful I expect I'll be<br>
freed eventually.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      Personally, I'm rather curious about what happens to a "self" released </i><br>
<i>&gt;      from physical containment.  I suppose for some extropians, in comes </i><br>
<i>&gt;      down to going for the likelier (or preferred) outcome</i><br>
<p>
If that's your absolute top priority, go for it! I respect your right to<br>
choose. Heinlein is reported to have said "How do I know it won't<br>
interfere with reincarnation?" when polled, near the end of his life, by a<br>
significant figure in the Cryonics scene. That man told me the story with<br>
a bitter shake of the head; I just closed my eyes for a moment and nodded.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      Seems like life without challenge and quest is apathy and </i><br>
<i>&gt;      inertia, once assured comfort has become mundane and there's no energy </i><br>
<i>&gt;      one needs to devote towards the most inane survival issue.</i><br>
<p>
I'll let you know once I've fully conquered my human genetic apparent <br>
predisposition for dysthymia (See David Pearce's _Hedonistic Imperative_<br>
Website). Having spent roughly 30 years in an endocrine holding pattern, I<br>
believe I could do with a few hundred of worthwhile striving--and yes, I<br>
do include cooperation in that :).<br>
<p>
Einstein is reputed to have said, late in life, "The most important<br>
question a person can ask is: 'Is the universe a friendly place?'."<br>
Either answer allows for plenty room to construct a Meaning of Life, and<br>
as much melodrama/"attachment" as you desire. If you're perfectly detached<br>
and desireless, then relaxing and floating downstream "is not dying"...<br>
and so what?<br>
<p>
The myth that I am in here and you are out there is how we live these<br>
days, most of us, most of the time. Sometimes we mung it, and sometimes it<br>
mungs us. If that changes, everything else changes.<br>
<p>
Paraphrasing the senior archangel at the end of _Stranger in a Strange<br>
Land_, "Of course 'thou art god'--now quit being so formal and _get back<br>
to work_!"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      To subscribe to life extension methods such as cryonics, I'd have to </i><br>
<i>&gt;      be more sure of what "life" is.  Too many details missing from this to </i><br>
<i>&gt;      make an informed decision.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      personality type required for such a job.  Maybe that's enough of a </i><br>
<i>&gt;      notion to go fot it.  For me, cryonics sounds like a better spin on </i><br>
<i>&gt;      life insurance...you may get to enjoy it.  Gentlemen, place your bets. </i><br>
<p>
Absolutely, that's all it is. As I mentioned, I feel freer, able on a more<br>
relaxed way, to discuss and even plan for my own possible eventual<br>
mortality, having hedged as best I can.<br>
