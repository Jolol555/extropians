"Kathryn Aegis" &lt;aegis@igc.apc.org&gt; wrote (in response to the <br>
Richter/Rand quotes):<br>
<p>
To expand slightly:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I quoted Richter as someone who has quite succinctly captured within </i><br>
<i>&gt;verbal parameters that mental place to which I have arrived, after </i><br>
<i>&gt;many years of shedding various ideologies, some imposed, some not. </i><br>
<i>&gt;(As such I didn't meant to indicate that his thinking is in any way </i><br>
<i>&gt;superior to anyone, Rand included, but merely that I relate to it.)</i><br>
<p>
I must admit I don't understand where you're coming from.  I get that you <br>
identify with the Richter quote (a VERY depressing utterance, IMHO). But <br>
then you state that you are unsure if this type of thinking is superior <br>
to any other. I don't know about you, but if I feel that my way of <br>
thinking about things (my philosophy) is inferior to any other, I set <br>
about trying to find the superior theory - so I can learn it and <br>
integrate it. You also said you relate to his quote - meaning that you <br>
respond in a favorable manner to it. My reaction is the exact opposite - <br>
I feel that the ideas which his quote represent are depressing, <br>
frightening, and even a bit dangerous.<br>
<p>
If anyone wants to find out why, I've decided to spend the morning <br>
explaining exactly why below. This is the first time I've done this <br>
(polemics), so I hope I don't bore anyone...<br>
<p>
Here's his quote again:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;'I have committed myself to thinking and acting without the support </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of any ideology.  Nothing can help me, there is no idea I can serve </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;or which, in exchange, could suggest what I must do.  No regulation </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;determines how, no belief points the way, no construction or vision </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of the future provides an overarching meaning.  Ideologies are always </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the seducers and exploiters of ignorance, they justify war.'</i><br>
<p>
OK - immediatly in the first sentence I know something is wrong: "I have <br>
committed myself to thinking and acting without the support of any <br>
ideology." To commit means to pledge one's self to a *position* on an <br>
issue, right? An ideology is a group of issues, ideas and opinions (and <br>
*positions*) about abstract ideas (a philosophy). So in essence, Richter <br>
is saying he doesn't commit himself to any philosophy - except the <br>
philosophy that that it's beneficial to operate without a philosophy. Or <br>
at least to deceive one's self that one operates without a philosophy. <br>
Smoke and mirrors, right in the first sentence!<br>
<p>
Next one. "Nothing can help me..." Uh-oh. "... there is no idea I can <br>
serve..." He believes WE should serve IDEAS?  "...or which, in exchange, <br>
could suggest what I must do."  First of all, he says nothing can help <br>
him. Fine. But then why are we listening to this guy talk about <br>
philosophy - a set of ideas that is supposed to help man live a better <br>
life? If he can't help himself with his own ideas, why are we listening <br>
to him? They he goes on to destroy the concept that abstract principles <br>
exist which can help guide our actions. In other worlds, he doesn't <br>
believe that something called ethics even exists. I don't think I'd feel <br>
comfortable being alone an elevator with this guy...<br>
<p>
"No regulation determine how, no belief points the way, no construction <br>
or vision of the future provides an overarching meaning" Oh, for crying <br>
out loud. This one speaks for itself.<br>
<p>
Is this guy still alive? He sounds so lost, it's almost pitiful. Is he a <br>
philosopher or does he work in some other field?<br>
<p>
"Ideologies are always the seducers and exploiters of ignorance, they <br>
justify war." Seems like he looked around and found that when people <br>
fight, they often are fighting about the ideas that they believe in. OK. <br>
But does this simple fact indicate that ALL idea systems are "seducers <br>
and exploiters of ignorance" and justifiers of war? No. That's a logical <br>
fallacy. One needs an ideology - a set of idea of how the universe works <br>
- in order to integrate new experiences. One must built abstract ideas <br>
about how to act to achieve one's goals. Richter is a crippled skeptic - <br>
so afraid of abstracts that he denies the value of philosophy itself.<br>
<p>
On a small tangent: I've been interested in fringe beliefs for many years <br>
- especially cult behavior. One of my favorite study subjects is <br>
Scientology - one reason why is because so much information is available <br>
about them on the Internet. Another reason is that Scientology's belief <br>
system and processes are without a doubt the most efficient and <br>
debilitating way to remove a person's ability to think rationally. It's a <br>
very interesting process to link up many of SCN's philosophical beliefs <br>
with those of modern philosophers(?) like Richter. SCN is an <br>
opportunistic parasitical organization. Many of our society's beliefs are <br>
so close to what SCN needs in order to exploit its members that all new <br>
converts need is a push in the right (wrong) direction and SCN has <br>
themselves another cult member/slave.<br>
<p>
SCN, in its introductory indoctrination routines, attempts in a very <br>
sneaky manner to internalize the belief system that Richter explicitly <br>
endorses. Richter encourages the removal of any and all belief systems - <br>
in other words, abstract concepts are bad, philosophy is bad, trying to <br>
think and apply abstract concepts to one's life is useless, etc. Trying <br>
to follow this philosophy is impossible - people must form abstract <br>
concepts in order to exist. What these ideas encourage is the appeal to <br>
emotions and feelings as the arbiter of the true, the correct, and the <br>
good. If one is prohibited from system-building, from thinking about <br>
abstracts, from adopting a philosophy, all they are left with is <br>
feelings! Prove me wrong. If a person can't or won't use reason (an <br>
abstract *systematic* method of knowledge acquisition, which Richter <br>
opposes) ALL they are left with is their FEELINGS. The only difference <br>
between skeptics and cultists is that skeptics muddle about in their own <br>
heads and feelings for truth, and cultists look to their leader and <br>
fellow group members for truth. For skeptics like Richter, what FEELS <br>
true to them IS true. For cultists, whatever L. Ron FEELS is true for <br>
them. Danger, Will Robinson, danger!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The utter purity of mental exploration without any principle to guide, no </i><br>
<i>&gt;belief to take refuge in, nothing to separate me from the rigors of </i><br>
<i>&gt;self-examination--that, to my thinking, forms the basis for true </i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom. I renew that commitment today, and welcome anyone's thoughts on </i><br>
<i>&gt;the concept of freedom.</i><br>
<p>
How can you explore without constructing a map? Beliefs are refuges? How <br>
can you examine yourself without any MEANS of examining yourself? How is <br>
the *direct* perception that you desire even possible? Our consciousness <br>
must perceive by *some* method, right?<br>
<p>
I'm genuinely curious about your attitude towards the points I've brought <br>
up.<br>
<p>
I was going to write a bit about E-Prime, but I've run out of steam.<br>
<p>
'Till next time!<br>
