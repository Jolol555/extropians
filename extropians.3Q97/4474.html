<p>
But we can imagine that immediately after the cloning, the clones<br>
would be placed in the Amnesia chamber and forget who they were. This<br>
is a useful heuristic, because if we calculate their rational<br>
estimates in the Amnesia chamber, and then update that estimate by<br>
having them find out that they were not outsiders, then the resulting<br>
estimate should equal what the clones in your original thought<br>
experiment should believe, since the information sets are the same in<br>
both cases. There might be some complication where clones are involved<br>
that I haven't thought of yet, but this is the way it is supposed to<br>
work in the God's coin toss scenario at least.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In your God's coin tosses experiment, the odds should be exactly</i><br>
<i>&gt; 10:1 no matter how many outsiders there are. Let H be "the coin</i><br>
<i>&gt; showed head" and C be "I was created as a result of the coin toss."</i><br>
<i>&gt; P(H|C)/P(not H|C)=P(C|H)P(H)/(P(C|not H)P(not H)). In your</i><br>
<i>&gt; calculations, you assume that P(H)=P(not H).</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that assumption is what I called "the negation of the <br>
Self-indication axiom".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But as I argued in the copying problem, and I think it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is true in this problem also, P(H)!=P(not H) given the subject's</i><br>
<i>&gt; state of knowledge after the coin toss. As a result P(H|C)/P(not</i><br>
<i>&gt; H|C) is exactly 10 even though P(C|H)/P(C|not H) only approaches 10</i><br>
<i>&gt; asymptoticly as the number of outsiders goes to infinity.</i><br>
<p>
Here you assume the Self-indication axiom. It would be wonderful if I<br>
could believe it (because it would refute the Doomsday argument), but<br>
you would have to help me to counter the two main arguments against it<br>
that I discuss in my paper, namely the problem the SIA would seem to<br>
imply that before I know anything about the world I should assign<br>
probability 1 to the proposition that there are infinitely many<br>
observers; and the argument from no coincidence.<br>
<p>
There seem to have been some interuption at my ISP, so I haven't seen<br>
my own post on the list or any responses it may have provoked. If<br>
someone beside Wai has written something on this thread betwen my last<br>
posting and this messege, I would be really greatful if they would<br>
forward it to me.<br>
