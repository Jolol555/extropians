Hmm, this gave me a truly bizarre idea: if somebody has a<br>
high-resolution chromophorous skin and a net link, it might be<br>
possible to use it as a kind of videophone. Imagine talking to a<br>
small face on your palm... <br>

<p>
Crazy? Hardly, at least not on this list. The normals all believe we<br>
are nuts anyway. :-)<br>
<p>
Hardware sharing is an interesting idea, especially if we upload<br>
ourselves and link up to different bodies for different tasks. I have<br>
already suggested Hertz Body Rental, where you can lease cloned<br>
bodies during your vacation. I can also imagine future teenagers<br>
asking their parents for the keys to the body...<br>
<p>
However, I think most people are so used to the idea of being<br>
individuals that they will not share hardware and would find other<br>
forms of existence somewhat frightening ("yes, I was a part of a<br>
group-mind when I was younger. Typical teenage rebellion..."). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another interesting possibility (but very dangerous and insecure yet) </i><br>
<i>&gt; in thinking about to create a super main processor where our </i><br>
<i>&gt; individualities would share the facilities. Don't know if it would be </i><br>
<i>&gt; good or bad, but the natural tendency would be the unification of all </i><br>
<i>&gt; the universe in just one counscious living organism, with various </i><br>
<i>&gt; "selfimages" that would be ourselves in better forms... Something </i><br>
<i>&gt; better that the ancient religious "God" imagination (or </i><br>
<i>&gt; selfprojection...)</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure I follow you how sharing the same processor would lead<br>
to a merger. A more likely model would be a huge "processor hotel",<br>
where infomorphs live in well protected memory areas. Merging minds<br>
is tricky...<br>

Only half joking... <br>
