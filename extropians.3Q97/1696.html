     "The following massive rant is meant for all those questioning the<br>
     idea of meme supremacy (some memes are [a lot] better than<br>
     others and one is the best [for all people, eventhough they may<br>
     not understand this yet]"<br>
     <br>
     Answer me this Mr Otter... the following concept is / is not the basis <br>
     for the scientific method: any idea, however attractive, is rejected <br>
     in the face of proof of it's falsity - ie: NO IDEA IS SACRED. <br>
     This may seem paradoxical to one as obviously obsessive as yourself, <br>
     and obsessive's tend to feel pain when confronted with paradox but <br>
     every poison has its' remedy: Here is my question: Can you please <br>
     explain how you manage to live in a logical universe free of <br>
     contradiction which contains the following memes: "One (meme) is the <br>
     best (supreme, I take it)" and "No idea is sacred". <br>
     <br>
     The concept of *no idea being sacred* is the basis for scientific <br>
     enquiry and it's emergence is largely responsible for the period we <br>
     know as the Rennaisance. It seems to follow that the loss of this <br>
     modus operandi would signal the final end of Rennaisance as well as <br>
     the west european civilization of which you seem so fond. <br>
     I stand open to correction on this point, of course.<br>
     <br>
     Your principle points in this opening paragraph to what is, if I may <br>
     say, quite a stunning piece of posting overall, is that <br>
     <br>
     A: All memes are not equal <br>
     and <br>
     B: One meme is the best. <br>
     <br>
     A is true, particularly given the context dependancy of all memes - <br>
     "Beauty is in the eye of the Beholder" and all that. Also: given that <br>
     the term "equal" (ditto "better" and "best") suggests a scale of some <br>
     kind; one wonders what this scale exists to measure? I would expect it <br>
     to represent a scale of value, namely your value (s), given your use <br>
     of the term "best" in statement B. I don't think I'm open to any <br>
     contradiction in saying that the term "best" is an absolute value <br>
     statement. <br>
     <br>
     I'm not sure whose values you claim to represent, but I'll guess that <br>
     they are yours. Unless you can provide me with some kind of petition <br>
     showing the names of those who share your values, I'm going to turn <br>
     this guess into an assumption.<br>
     <br>
     Statement "B" is just bollocks I'm afraid, objectively speaking (and I <br>
     hate speaking objectively), although I'm sure it is subjectively true <br>
     for you.<br>
     <br>
     Now that I've gotten that stuff out of the way; here's my translation <br>
     from your pseudo pop scientific drivel:   <br>
     <br>
     "some memes are [a lot] better than<br>
     others and one is the best [for all people, eventhough they may<br>
     not understand this yet]"<br>
     <br>
     means:<br>
     <br>
     I like some ideas (a lot) better than others. I like one idea best. <br>
     Everyone should agree with me, even if they don't (or is it "even if <br>
     they are too stupid to."?).<br>
     <br>
     Well, that just lovely, Mr Otter. Again I stress: Unless you manage to <br>
     replace this idea that *one meme is supreme for all people* with a <br>
     working understanding of *no idea being sacred*; I'm afraid it's going <br>
     to be you and people like you that most threaten (what used to be <br>
     called western) civilization. And I'm most happy to tell you that <br>
     there's plenty of us out here to stop you making that mistake for <br>
     everyone else.<br>
     <br>
     Scanning the rest of your diatribe I found nothing else I feel like <br>
     commenting on just now, except:<br>
     <br>
     "The good news is that brains will almost certainly be <br>
     "reprogrammable" in<br>
     the future, thus giving ultimately all (blah, blah, blah)" - sometimes <br>
     this almost does strike me as good news...almost.<br>
     <br>
     In closing:<br>
     You're a young, good looking, white male. If you're out to achieve <br>
     world domination for yourself and your kind my advice is this:<br>
     <br>
     "Get a note from your mom. Because you're going to have to take at <br>
     least a day off of school for this."<br>
