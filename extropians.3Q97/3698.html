Dear fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
It seems that Mr. Elis a/k/a Hagbard, believes that my comments darken the<br>
mind. Could it be that he is referring to the alternative definition and<br>
is simply bewildered?<br>
The use of the word OBFUSCATORY as Mr. Elis proffers it seems, in some<br>
sense, a bit sophomoric. Is it possible that despite the breadth of his<br>
reading he lacks the depth of perception necessary to understand my humble<br>
and eglectic philosophies.<br>
<p>
I can understand as well that there are some who choose to reject concepts<br>
outside their limited experience and the constraints imposed by their<br>
culture. There are those as well who attempt to transcend the external<br>
restraints or constraints of their culture and who wish to develop greater<br>
understanding.<br>
<p>
Despite such bland rejection as Mr. Elis wishes to present, let us all<br>
(hopefully including Mr. Elis) search our minds and remove such clouds as<br>
may prevent us from seing far greater realities than we have previously<br>
considered.<br>
<p>
Can we all say "Cogito ergo sum" and speed onward into unexplored<br>
thoughts?<br>
<p>

<p>
"Obfuscatory!"<br>
<p>
I spilled a good plate of pasta on my keyboard thanks to you! <br>

Can't stop laughing,<br>
