I realized one good reason why I've been uncomfortable with<br>
discussions of all the new kinds and styles of sex that will someday<br>
be possible.  Its the same reason I'm uncomfortable with disscussion<br>
of all the kinds of sex that are possible today (and there's quite a<br>
few).  <br>
<p>
In a gathering of people some of who were literally starving for food,<br>
I would feel uncomfortable talking about all the yummy variations of<br>
chinese food that are possible to the minority of people who were not<br>
only not starving, but rich enough to explore all those variations.  I<br>
would fear that such a discussion would make the starving folks feel<br>
worse and more envious.  Of course I would likely<br>
engage in some charity in such a situation, but quite likely that<br>
would not erase the have/havenot division.<br>
<p>
Similarly, many people in our society are literally starving for sex,<br>
at least of the sort that they value.  While our society is rich<br>
enough to have plenty of food, the market for sex has many more<br>
frictions that the market for food, and technology has not<br>
substantially lowered the costs of sex.  Many people do not feel they<br>
are attractive enough to be in much demand sexually, or for other<br>
reasons are not able to participate.  And sexual charity is very<br>
limited.  I fear that these people are just made to feel worse by<br>
discussion of all the variations beyond their reach.<br>
<p>
Note I'm not proposing to ban such discussions.  I'm just describing a<br>
reason for my unease.  <br>
