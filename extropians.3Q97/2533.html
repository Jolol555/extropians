One nanite generates a sphere of daughter nanites; don't they start<br>
getting in each other's way?  If you want to say they migrate, how do<br>
they know how far to go for a given volume, or what that volume is?<br>
(And how fast can nanites crawl, anyway?)<br>

Hal's right; we are having a problem agreeing on scenarios.  I don't<br>
associate "gray goo" with "nanopower".  I've been mostly assuming gray<br>
goo is disassmblers run amok.  If not, how is the source controlling and<br>
protecting itself from the nanites?  (How are the nanites not eating<br>
themselves?)  Plenty of room for perversion, here.<br>

I don't think they can spread that fast.<br>

 <br>
How would the organism be floating in an aqueous environment?  I don't<br>
float in an aqueous environment.  And if you accept immune systems<br>
fighting nanites then you can't assume the organism is in a sea of goo,<br>
because to make that sea the nanites would have had to eat lots of other<br>
organisms with immune systems.<br>
<p>
} &gt; } But those communication lines are on the outside of your organism. <br>
} &gt; } You would need an immune system that extends all over the place and <br>
} &gt; No, you need artillery.<br>
} Are you proposing that you are going to sit on the roof of your <br>
} bunker and hold the nanites back with a canon?<br>
<p>
You'd said they'd use high explosives; I said that was pretty smart for<br>
good.  You said they'd use lines of communication outside my "castle".<br>
If they're dependent on lines of communication to attack me then<br>
disrupting those lines with cannon is a perfectly viable stategy.  No<br>
communication, no dynamite, I'm safe.<br>
<p>
Really though, their best bet for high explosibes is themselves.  Coal<br>
dust can make a pretty boom, due to the high surface area for the mass.<br>
<p>
Note the different scenarios we're jumping among.  Nanites trying to<br>
invade an organism.  Nanites trying to become a sea of goo without being<br>
bombed or dusted.  A sea of goo against a hardened and nano-capable<br>
(but not global) bunker.  Sometimes it's real goo; other times it's<br>
stuff with internal communcation and solar panels, trying to make<br>
dynamite or nukes.<br>
<p>
Personally I'm still suspicious of this conception of nanites.  Little<br>
atomic manipulators made of a single type of material trying to be more<br>
capable than whole slews of complex enzymes, often dependent on<br>
different transition metals, crawling around in a vast variety of<br>
environments, and being able to take over the world in their first<br>
generation.  They have to get energy, deliver it over distance<br>
(otherwise my bunker need only be a dais of hematite or bauxite) and in<br>
some scenarios, communicate, perceive, and plan against macroscopic<br>
entities.  Right.<br>
