<p>
I've done little legislative history concerning the 2nd, but an educated<br>
guess would be that to get it ratified, the delegates made both of those<br>
arguments, and more. Hunting for meat and/or the skins trade was pretty<br>
important both economically and also for an individual's livelihood. And<br>
self-defense has always been offered as a valid reason for weapons<br>
proliferation. Unfortunately, the Congress was secret and the only notes<br>
made were Madison's and Jefferson's (?) so we have a tough time knowing<br>
what they were really trying to do. <br>
<p>
What is crucial is that the drafters offered a reason for the Amendment<br>
within the text itself, "A well-regulated militia being necessary to the<br>
security of a free state..." However, is this the only reason? And what<br>
happens when a well-regulated militia no longer becomes necessary? <br>
<p>
Anyway, I personally feel that the legislative intent is irrelevant.<br>
There are several canons of statutory construction, some placing<br>
emphasis on the "plain meaning" of the words as written, others<br>
emphasizing legislative intent, still others ignoring both and opting<br>
for Constiutional dynamism. I tend to feel that especially where the<br>
original intent is cloudy, and the plain meaning of words such as<br>
"militia", "Arms", and "infringed" is unclear, a more suitable line of<br>
inquiry is "What effect should these words have on our lives today?"<br>
This is a somewhat distilled version of Constitutional dynamism.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Taken in context with the Declaration of Independence...and the Federalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; Papers...I would interpret the 2nd ammendment as the ultimate gaurantor of</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual rights...or to put it crudely.....when the government gets outa</i><br>
<i>&gt; hand...the citizens have the means to slap it down..</i><br>
<p>
The Framers built-in a self-destruct mechanism. This is an entirely new<br>
idea to me, and quite interesting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In that context automatic weapons...not to mention rockets..mortars or pocket</i><br>
<i>&gt; nukes seem perfectly acceptable.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly. The definition of "Arms" as it is used in the 2nd is one of the<br>
biggest problems.<br>
