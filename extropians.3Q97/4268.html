~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
First, let me thank and congratulate Mr. Mann for organizing and initiating<br>
the debate on the Neuro-Semantic Political Illusion Complex (NSPIC).  I<br>
subscribed to list extropians@extropy.org because of Mr. Mann's announcement<br>
of the debate on other lists and have not been disappointed yet.  This NSPIC<br>
seems to subsume the "not invented here syndrome" (NIHS) and related cultural<br>
defects, and keeps the public oblivious of the factors adversely affecting<br>
the general welfare of the commonwealth.   If I understand Mr. Mann's several<br>
posts correctly, he hopes the debate will bring to the fore a group of<br>
freedom loving individuals who, collectively, will persuade the public to<br>
shed the NSPIC as they would shed a soiled garment.  <br>
<p>
That, it seems to me, must be a three step process of persuasion of which the<br>
first step must persuade the enforcers of the NSPIC that their interests will<br>
be as justly secured without the NSPIC as it has been with the NSPIC.  If<br>
that first step is not successfully accomplished, these freedom loving<br>
individuals will not live long enough to provide the public with a clean<br>
garment to replace the soiled one.  Recall the fate of the Old Testament<br>
Prophets and Christ, and more recently the fate of U.S. Presidents Lincoln,<br>
Garfield, McKinley and Kennedy who also omitted the first step and lost the<br>
opportunity to complete the second and third step in releasing the public<br>
from the NSPIC.<br>
<p>
Second, I thank Lee Daniel Crocker, for correcting my uncertain presentation<br>
of his interest, and Kennita Watson for so concisely defining our common<br>
interest as I should have defined it in my post "The General Theory of<br>
Reproducible Productive Assets."<br>
<p>
Kennita Watson concluded by saying: "&lt;WesBurt&gt;, this may point out that a<br>
*brief* message pointing out to people what their interest is in the TEFLON<br>
TOPIC may generate more interest in it."  <br>
<p>
It is not easy for a poor old mechanical engineer with a 2.5/4.0 grade-point<br>
average to communicate as effectively as William Shakespeare or a New Age<br>
Liberal Arts Graduate, and it is even more difficult to be "brief" when<br>
discussing a simple fact of life that has been under the protection of the Neu<br>
ro-Semantic Political Illusion Complex since Moses smashed the first two<br>
tables of stone containing the whole Twelve Moral Commandments.   Perhaps the<br>
following year old post will define the TEFLON TOPIC well enough to enable<br>
the debate to continue on NSPIC.<br>

Dear Innocents,<br>
<p>
"My idea of a conceptual model of world transformation, one that is <br>
simple enough to be technically valid, is a model that addresses the<br>
 singular public interest of each nation, rather than its many private<br>
 interests.  Consequently, such a model has no natural constituency<br>
 in the United States where we are educated to believe in THE ZERO-<br>
SUM SOCIETY and THE ZERO-SUM SOLUTION.  <br>
<p>
The "Great Satan" has kept the singular public interest of a nation out <br>
of the public domain ever since King Rehoboam (Son of Solomon,<br>
 I Kings 12:23-24) raised taxes too high in B.C. 975, and destroyed the<br>
 Biblical Commonwealth of Israel, sending ten tribes into historical <br>
oblivion and two tribes (Judah and Benjamin) into Persian captivity.  This <br>
model of the singular  public interest has its technical anchor in the <br>
diverse and decentralized  financial structure that allows multi-national <br>
corporations to deliver their  products everywhere in today's global <br>
markets.  That is where I first discovered the model.  It has its historical <br>
anchor in the First Tithe (Gen.14:18-20) which Abraham paid to <br>
Melchizedek, King of  Salem,  for the support of "a school for the <br>
propagation of the knowledge of God," according to the late Chief <br>
Rabbi of the British Empire Dr. J. H. Hertz.   <br>
<p>
Notice that this "knowledge of God" (or this accumulated wisdom <br>
of mankind) must include, as the founders of  the United States <br>
believed, both "the Laws of Nature," which are  always effective, <br>
and the Laws "of Nature's God," which are made effective only by <br>
an informed public opinion.  Education, as the founders  understood <br>
it, is obviously a vital part of an optimum public policy.   Where both <br>
kinds of Laws are not taught, Democracy Sucks!<br>
<p>
There is no invention, no copyright, no patent application involved in this<br>
 conceptual model, or should we call it a Law "of Nature's God?  This<br>
 Law is only a joining together of the observations of many members of<br>
 the cognitive elite who, historically, and as long as they acted alone as <br>
poets, prophets, philosophers, corporate managers, Kings, and <br>
statesmen were unable to effectively convey their conception of a <br>
stable, efficient, and prosperous social order to the public.  More <br>
exactly, they were unable to persuade their fellow members of the elite<br>
 that such a social order could be conveyed to the public, without placing <br>
at risk the livelihood and perhaps the lives of the ruling elite.  <br>
<p>
There are long standing vested interests in the United States, and in <br>
every society, which are ever and always opposed to any attempt to<br>
 inform the public about how the whole system operates.  This <br>
opposition is surely innocent where businessmen are concerned with <br>
protecting propriatary knowledge of corporate techniques which they <br>
have developed at their own expense.  But when that opposition keeps<br>
 the public of any nation misinformed and ignorant of the corporate <br>
techniques and methods that became part of the domestic policy of <br>
Germany under John J. McCloy (CFR) and became part of the <br>
domestic policy of Japan under Douglas MacArthur (CFR); that  <br>
opposition, regardless of its source, must be called treason against <br>
mankind.  And if not the ultimate Evil, then that opposition must be <br>
acknowledged as technical incompetence bordering on functional <br>
illiteracy.  <br>
<p>
As I see this topic,  It has been addressed by serious reformers down <br>
through the ages, with only occasional success.  One reason for their<br>
 failure may be because the powerful nations that were setting new <br>
standards of better government (Greece and Rome in their day, <br>
England in the 19th century, and the U.S. in the 20th century) had no<br>
 contemporary economic superiors that they could be compared with<br>
 to make a strong argument for change.  That condition vanished for <br>
England with W.W. I, for the U.S. in the late 1960's, and its absence is <br>
slowly being recognized by the media and the public, but members of<br>
the U.S. establishment are still stonewalling on this question.<br>
<p>
 The not invented here (NIH) syndrome often obstructs dialog on this <br>
simple model, even though the topic is clearly the COMMON CAUSE of<br>
 everyone capable of thinking constructively about the subject.  We are <br>
not dealing here with a package of proprietary knowledge which every <br>
clever canine pyschologist can sniff at and then turn to his own <br>
advantage.   As Moses Maimonides implied in THE GUIDE FOR THE<br>
 PERPLEXED, 1168, these "Divergent problems" last only as long as <br>
powerful men want them to last, then they become "Convergent<br>
 problems" that are easily solved.<br>
<p>
So what else is new?  Hasn't it always been the perennial agenda of  <br>
the intellectually gifted,  the priestly establishment, "The thirteenth<br>
Tribe,"<br>
 "the gang in posession," and Barbara Hooton's "comfortable classes"<br>
 who thought there were two species of human beings (the rich and <br>
the poor), to keep the  majority of the population in a "third world" <br>
condition of being pregnant, poor, and innocent?  Isn't skinning the <br>
innocent public always the preferred sport of the wealthy, healthy, <br>
intelligent, and powerful?<br>
<p>
Too often perhaps, but not always!  History does record several<br>
occasions when the "best and the brightest" did act to promote the <br>
general welfare of their people.  Remember from your bible reading <br>
that the original Moses (not the late M. Maimonides, 1168), a member <br>
of the 13th tribe, did teach the Twelve Moral Commandments to the <br>
twelve tribes of Israel to found a commonwealth that reached its <br>
apogee of wealth and power under Solomon in B.C. 975, and was<br>
 then ruined by the unjust taxes imposed by King Rehoboam.  Greece<br>
 and Rome were given their day in the sun in an age when the <br>
maintainence of the slaves and serfs (a majority of the population) was <br>
at the expense of the masters (call it Village Ethics or Family Values), <br>
and those ages are now remembered as "golden ages."  <br>
<p>
More recently, the barons did wrest the Magna Carta from King John in <br>
1215 to make England a better place than the continent of Europe for<br>
 the following 750 years.  America's founding fathers did establish a fifth<br>
 great commonwealth on the principles promulgated in the American <br>
Declaration of Independence in 1776.  The Congress of the United <br>
States did pass the G.I. Bill in 1942.  And President Nixon did propose<br>
in August 1969 his Family Assistance Plan.  If Congress had enacted <br>
Nixon's FAP, it would have raised the level of sustaining feedback from <br>
the present 50% to about 75% of the level needed to eliminate the "root <br>
cause" of systemic inflation and unemployment in the U.S.  <br>
<p>
 No new thinking has entered the closed American mind since Henry<br>
 Carter Adams stated the problem in 1887.  He wrote, in his essay, <br>
RELATION OF THE STATE TO INDUSTRIAL ACTION:  <br>
<p>
"The most unfortuneate consequence of so vicious a method of <br>
education in economics is found in the fact that the collapse of faith in<br>
 the sufficiency of the philosophy of laissez-faire, has left the present<br>
generation without principles adequate for the guidance of public affairs.<br>
 ------- The problem may be stated in a word, as follows:  The authority of<br>
 English economy has been shattered beyond recovery; can a truer <br>
system of economic thought gain control of the American mind?" <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
 Not in the 19th. century, and not yet in the second half of the twentieth <br>
century, if the 1996 campaign promises of President Clinton and <br>
Senator Dole and the dialog on the internet are true indicators of the <br>
American mind today.<br>
<p>
Blessings on all the innocents,<br>

Remember what the first step must accomplish.  It must lift the NSPIC from<br>
the minds of those who enforce the NSPIC.  It's slow work!<br>
