and<br>

requirements,<br>

Biochemistry, for any living thing, is a very sloppy thing.  Suboptimal<br>
enzymes, indirect pathways, multiple pathways, and messy genetic controls are<br>
not merely the rule, but flat-out universal.  Living things are highly<br>
constrained by the need to proceed by small evolutionary steps, all at least<br>
viable.  <br>
<p>
If bacteria are optimized for anything, it's for the ability to evolve<br>
rapidly (which they do), which is for minimal design.  Design is very<br>
expensive for life, since it proceeds by very occasional mutation and then<br>
elimination of all inferior variants.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Cars are optimised. </i><br>
<p>
In no sense.  They get substantially better every year even after you<br>
discount for technological improvement.  In what sense could they possibly be<br>
optimal at any point?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Much </i><br>
<i>&gt;commersial software is also fairly optimised. But you have a point </i><br>
<i>&gt;here. There is also commersial software whose performance is not </i><br>
<i>&gt;optimized, and in some cases it can still it can be highly </i><br>
<i>&gt;non-trivial to design it. So if that is the relevant analogy then it </i><br>
<i>&gt;points in the direction Carl intended it to.</i><br>
<p>
Where is this optimized software?  Where can I get it?  My computer has been<br>
invaded by bloatware for over a decade.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;To build an optimised nano </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;self-reproducing device would be much harder than simply to make </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;something useful that can replicate. For example, a universal Turing </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;machine has been constructed in Conway's Life world. The entity is </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;very big and it was hard, but nothing near a thousands of genius-year </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;task, to do it. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
"The Recursive Universe" by William Poundstone.  It has a good layman's<br>
description of Conway's proof, and some guesstimates of what it would take to<br>
actually make a self-replicating Life computer (conclusion: no time soon).<br>
