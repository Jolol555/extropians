Hmm, here's a Wilson quote (our Net link is lousy at the moment so I can't<br>
access the pages I wanted to quote from): <br>
<p>
     "Consider next the high temperature of Venus (480C).  As Dr.<br>
     Roger Wescott and others have pointed out, Dr. Velikovsky<br>
     predicted a temperature in this range for Venus when<br>
     astronomical orthodoxy believed that planet much, much colder.<br>
     Sagan tries to avoid giving Dr. Velikovsky credit for this<br>
     confirmation of his model by claiming many had predicted a high<br>
     temperature before the Venus flyby.  Actually, he only names one<br>
     other who made such a prediction, Dr. Rupert Wildt, and Wildt's<br>
     work did not win general acceptance (others try to get around<br>
     Dr. Velikovsky's correct estimate in this and other instances by<br>
     describing him as a lucky guesser.  That seems mere cage<br>
     rattling to me.  One Could as well call any scientist who made<br>
     many correct predictions a lucky guesser ...)...<br>
<p>
     "But the final joker came on page 153 of Broca's Brain where<br>
     Sagan writes (and this really deserves caps):<br>
<p>
      ONE NOW FASHIONABLE SUGGESTION I FIRST PROPOSED IN 1960 IS<br>
     THAT THE HIGH TEMPERATURES ON THE SURFACE OF VENUS ARE DUE TO A<br>
     RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE EFFECT.  (All emphasis added and deserved)<br>
<p>
     "First, Sagan claims that Dr. Velikovsky does not deserve<br>
     credit for predicting high temperatures on Venus because<br>
     everybody knew it, although historical fact shows that only Dr.<br>
     Wildt had made the same prediction before Velikovsky.  Then<br>
     Sagan either tells a double lie or else suffers an alarming<br>
     memory lapse that may require neurological consultation claiming<br>
     that neither Dr. Wildt nor Dr. Velikovsky had made this<br>
     prediction (which they had, and he had noted earlier) -- and<br>
     then he brazenly claims he had originated it himself.  Quite a<br>
     performance wouldn't you say?"<br>
	- Robert Anton Wilson, "The Astronomer Who Abolished Gravity,"<br>
		Cosmic Trigger III, Mask, (Tempe, AZ, 1995),pp. 197-198<br>
<p>
Now, I don't believe in Velikovsky's theories either, but if this is true<br>
(and I found, but have since lost, a Web page listing numerous other<br>
occasions where Sagan claimed that Velikovsky was wrong in such respects<br>
then later adopted Velikovsky's opinions) then I'm not impressed. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The nuclear winter theory may or may not be true, but one thing is</i><br>
<i>&gt;certain, it has absolutely nothing to do with human political theories, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;has to do with the atmosphere.</i><br>
<p>
Nonsense. Nuclear winter theory has little to do with the atmosphere and<br>
everything to do with choice of parameters in atmospheric models. By<br>
choosing different parameters you could create anything from a 'nuclear<br>
summer' to a 'nuclear absolute zero'. Sagan was a big supporter of<br>
limiting the number of nuclear weapons and, oddly, the parameters his<br>
group chose showed that we'd get a nuclear winter. Later, when people<br>
actually did some experiments to determine the validity of the model the<br>
parameters were found to be dramatically overpessimistic. The same model<br>
predicted millions of dead in Asia after the Iraquis ignited the Kuwaiti<br>
oil-wells; the real effect was minimal. Their model clearly had absolutely<br>
nothing to do with the atmosphere. <br>
<p>
Or, in other words, "Garbage in, garbage out". <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The atmosphere doesn't give a hoot in hell</i><br>
<i>&gt;about Liberals, Conservatives, Communists, Libertarians , Socialists or</i><br>
<i>&gt;even Extropians. The atmosphere is just interested in Thermodynamics. </i><br>
<p>
But we're not talking about the atmosphere, we're talking about<br>
atmospheric models. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If Dr. Sagan thought there was one chance in a thousand of being correct</i><br>
<i>&gt;it was his duty to shout it from the rooftops.</i><br>
<p>
Really? Should he really have gone out to the mass media rather than<br>
suggesting the possibility to the atmospheric physics community for them<br>
to review? Even today most people believe in 'nuclear winters' even though<br>
the evidence seems to show that Sagan was wrong. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If it turns out he was</i><br>
<i>&gt;wrong there is no disgrace in that, all the great scientists were wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt;about something important in their careers, its part of the Scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt;method. </i><br>
<p>
But most of them didn't go out and push their theories on TV, they used<br>
that Scientific Method to discover whether they were correct. Why was<br>
Sagan more concerned with publicity than truth? <br>
