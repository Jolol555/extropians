In a message dated 97-09-20 22:02:39 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; But to show I can, I shall now prove four related propositions:<br>
 1)  The sky is green.<br>
 2)  The sky is purple.<br>
 3)  The sky has red polka-dots.<br>
 4)  (Generalized:)  The sky is any color.<br>
 <br>
 1)  Sun is yellow.  Sky is blue.  Yellow + blue = green.<br>
 2)  The sky is purple, at night.<br>
 3)  The stars are polka-dots.  Some of them are red giants.<br>
 4)  There are many planets in the Universe.  Some of them will have skies of<br>
 any given color.<br>
 <br>
 I did not make up the explanations first.  First I made up the propositions,<br>
 then I proved them.  Note that every explanation is *true*.  No matter how<br>
 ridiculous the propositions may seem, they are quite correct.  If I'd shown<br>
 you those propositions and told you I was going to prove them, you would<br>
have<br>
 laughed.  Instead you are now placed in the position of asserting that they<br>
 are sober fact.<br>
 <br>
 Which they aren't.  Three are flawed.  You see, given my enormous talent in<br>
 the area of rationalization, I have become *very* good at detecting<br>
incorrect<br>
 ones.  But can you find the flaws?<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Hi,<br>
 they're all flaws,<br>
<p>
because <br>
1) the sky is only blue and yellow, not green, but then again there are<br>
sometimes tints of greens in storms and at sunsets<br>
2)if the sky is purple it isnt fully night, but then again in cities that<br>
have pollution the sky may look purple<br>
3)stars are not polkadots, they're stars, but then again stars are just words<br>
to define those bright round things in the sky, and they llok like points<br>
rather than dots, or maybe just very small dots<br>
4)you dont know for a fact about those planets, they could or couldnt, but<br>
there's a high probability they could<br>
<p>
so they all can be explained either way, as a lot of things are that way, so<br>
there's a mystery to it.<br>
<p>
The proof about astrology is that is that many if not all the predictions are<br>
correct in some way.  Astrology is very old.  there's a tribe in africa (the<br>
dogon tribe) who have known about the star sirius b (sirius a's companion,<br>
the sirius constellation is what the pyramids of giza are aligned to)<br>
thousands of years before we had the technology to discover it. It proves<br>
theres a mysterious force, and the thing is there's SO many things like that.<br>
