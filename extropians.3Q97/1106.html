Dear Anton and other fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
In a recent message Anton asked me what the most significant piece of<br>
legislation I ever worked on was. He stated that this was done to please<br>
the Anarchists among us. (Yes, I was at the Woodstock festival way back<br>
when, but, that's another story.)<br>
<p>
I'm not really sure that I can fully answer that question since the long<br>
term effects of some of the legislative actions I was involved in have not<br>
yet had their full effect.<br>
On the other hand one of the laws that I helped promulgate many years ago<br>
has already had a significant effect in the State of New York. It was, if<br>
nothing else, one of the most enjoyable and enlightening inquiries I ever<br>
worked on. <br>
<p>
I guess that it's nostalgic story time.  <br>
<p>
Many eons ago I became involved in a legal and sociological inquiry into<br>
social referral services. Sometimes, under certain circumstances, they are<br>
referred to as computer dating services. This inquiry resulted from<br>
consumer complaints about a computer dating service that was opperating in<br>
NYS. <br>
<p>
It seems that some door-to-door salesmen were involved in selling the<br>
service for in excess of $1000. while using a retail installment contract<br>
with a fairly high interest rate. They claimed in their sales pitch that<br>
the matches that they could make using a computer would be absolutely<br>
compatible with their client's profiles. They offered a guarantee of<br>
compatibility or your money back. Obviously, the claims and the refund<br>
offer were somewhat lacking in sincerity.<br>
<p>
While conducting the inquiry and gathering evidence I was able to<br>
determine the following:<br>
<p>
1. The company did not have a computer.<br>
2. There was no data base of compatible characteristics.<br>
3. Only very (highly?) limited social and psychological research had been<br>
done in the scientific disciplines on the subjects of social, intellectual<br>
and emotional compatability.<br>
4. Congress had refused to appropriate funds to the NIMH and other<br>
interested social scientists to conduct research and other studies in<br>
human compatibility (This obviously contradicts the claims of many well<br>
know politicians claimed interest in "family values") as a waste of<br>
taxpayers funds. <br>
5. The information on clients of the company was available for commercial<br>
exploitation (and possible blackmail).<br>
<p>
As the evidence of possible wrongdoing accumulated we held a public<br>
hearing in advance of preparing and intoducing legislation. Among the<br>
experts I consulted with while accumulating evidence were Dr. Margaret<br>
Mead, Dr. Benjamin A. Passamanick, Dr. Stanley Milgram, Dr. Abraham Maslow<br>
and numerous other prominant social scientists. I also interviewed several<br>
hundred of the consumers who had given money to the company. In the<br>
process I think I learned a little about human behavior.<br>
<p>
Following the hearing a bill was introduced in the NYS legislature which<br>
resulted in Section 394-c of the General Business Law. <br>
<p>
The legislation, which regulated for-profit organizations involved in the<br>
sale of commercial social referal services saved a lot of people a lot of<br>
money in the very short term. It provided guarantees that the privacy of<br>
the people who became involved in social referral service schemes would be<br>
protected. It provided a basis whereby legitimate research in human<br>
compatibility could be conducted. It helped to educate many professionals<br>
as to the extent of the problems of  "The Lonely Crowd." <br>
<p>
Ultimately, the actions we took, in addition to passing needed regulatory<br>
legislation,<br>
resulted in some changes and improvements in our social systems. <br>
<p>
While these changes may seem minor in the overall scheme of things, I'd<br>
like to think that It had some real effect on educating and otherwise<br>
helping a lot of people over the years. <br>
<p>
Even if we don't accomplish all we that we would like to accomplish in our<br>
lifetimes, as long as what little we do accomplish aids our society in<br>
some material way and makes the world we live in a better place, then, I<br>
think, we have lived a worthwhile life.<br>
<p>
Enjoy!!!<br>
