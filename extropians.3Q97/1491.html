Andrea Gallagher has already eloquently stated many of the points I <br>
would have made.  I will make a couple of short comments and quote a<br>
passage from the book The Bell Curve by Richard J. Herrnstein and <br>
Charles Murray which I read it a couple of years ago.  <br>
<p>
"Our fourth answer has been that group differences in cognitive ability,<br>
so desperately denied for so long, can best be handled - can only be handled -<br>
by a return to individualism.  A person should not be judged as a member of<br>
a group but as an individual.  With that cornerstone of the American <br>
doctrine once again in place, group differences can take their appropriately<br>
insignificant place in affecting American life.  But until that cornerstone<br>
is once again in place, the anger, the hurt, and the animosities will<br>
continue to grow."  (The Bell Curve; Page 550)<br>
<p>
Since Herrnstein and Murray lived in the USA and wrote about policies<br>
and history of the USA, they use the term "American" in the above passage;<br>
I would suggest that the term "Extropian" could be substituted and the<br>
passage would still retain much of its meaning.<br>
<p>
As I understand the Extropian tradition, racial group differences are of<br>
little or no importance.  I would urge that we promote "individualism" as<br>
opposed to "racial groupism" in order to work toward creating a more robust<br>
and desirable future.  <br>
