In a message dated 97-09-09 12:56:27 EDT, you write:<br>

      EvMick (from Illinois) wrote:<br>
      <br>
      Give me an example of (what) the excesses that can and do occur in a <br>
      totally uncontrolled marketplace....give me an example of a totally <br>
      uncontrolled market place...define excess.<br>
      <br>
      Rick Knight responds:<br>
      <br>
      See The Tobacco Industry in the early part of this century in the U.S. <br>
      and elsewhere on the planet in recent times. <br>
<p>
To which I would add:<br>
<p>
      I don't know about the early part of this century...but currently the<br>
tobacco industry is heavily controlled....if you consider taxation and<br>
controls on advertising. I would argue that it does not meet the<br>
criteria...also I don't see how it could even be considered...it being but<br>
one industry in the "market" which is very obviously NOT free.. <br>
      <br>
      I would say that excess has been reached when the marketplace, big on <br>
      desire and short on information and wisdom, is given the free will to <br>
      slowly kill themselves and debilitate the community at large, <br>
      impacting health care costs and productivity.<br>
<p>
I would add:<br>
<p>
This is not making sense to me...market place with desire? wisdom?  free<br>
will?  Given by who...<br>
<p>
The ideal  of a "Free Market" is that of individuals freely buying and<br>
selling goods and services..by definition if it is not free it is<br>
controlled....if it is controlled then it is slavery.  I have no problem with<br>
someone killing himself...I don't (nor do I want to) own that person...it's<br>
his body...his life...his decesion.<br>
<p>
As far as health care,,,etc....that only applies if you steal the money to<br>
pay for it...<br>
      <br>
      And then EvMick quoted Voltaire:<br>
      <br>
      Whoever has power in his hands wants to be despotic; the craze for<br>
      domination is an incurable disease.<br>
      <br>
      Rick responds:<br>
      <br>
      I regard the inclination to be a despot decreases in accordance with <br>
      an increase of information and a lack of fear unless you are a <br>
      sociopath.  In that case, all bets are off.  <br>
 <br>
 To which I reply:<br>
<p>
I don't agree: Clinton and his cronies are pushing Key Escrow as we<br>
speak...this INCREASES my fear..Of Government....and yeah...maybe I am a<br>
sociopath...care to define the term as you understand it?  No argument that<br>
I'm paranoid.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
                                                                     Besides,<br>
it's hard to <br>
      give any viable weight to something that was said at the infancy of <br>
      the Industrial Age (that still echoed Agrarian age influence) when we <br>
      are preparing to eclispse it in this one.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
To which I reply...<br>
<p>
Like  "Give me liberty or Give Me Death"...Patrick Henry<br>
<p>
."They that give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety<br>
deserve neither liberty nor safety.  - Ben Franklin, patriot and rebel rouser<br>
<p>
When I was a boy I was told that anybody could become President; I'm<br>
beginning to believe it. - Clarence Darrow<br>
<p>
I could no doubt come up with lots and lots of statements made at the<br>
beginning of the Industrial Revolution...or before...from say...Newton,<br>
Gallileo..Pastuer.Edison.the lists is long.<br>
<p>
None of that is relevant?  Just because it... "was said at the infancy of <br>
      the Industrial Age (that still echoed Agrarian age influence) when we <br>
      are preparing to eclispse it in this one."<br>
<p>
We don't still have Agrarian Age Influence...?  I have a quarter million<br>
dollars worth of John Deere Tractors on my wagon right now...not Agrarian?<br>
 Toffler (Third Wave) speaks of multiple COINCIDENTALLY OCCURING influences.<br>
 Agrarian, Industrial, Information....Ages...all at the same time.<br>
