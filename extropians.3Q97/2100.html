<p>
In response to passionate, but irrational pressure from some in the<br>
bioethics community, Congress is considering three completely unnecessary<br>
anti-cloning bills: <br>
<p>
HR922-- Banning the use of Federal funds to support research on the<br>
	cloning of humans (out of committee, up for vote by House).<br>
<p>
HR923-- $5000 penalty for the cloning of humans (still in Committee on<br>
	Commerce, Subcommittee on Health and Environment).<br>
<p>
S368--	Banning the use of Federal funds to support cloning research<br>
	(still in Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources).<br>
<p>
* These bills are vaguely phrased, and will have un-intended side effects<br>
  on useful and non-controversial research.<br>
<p>
* Adequate safeguards against abuse of cloning technology already exist.<br>
  In order to avoid an overly-controlling, bloated government, Congress<br>
  must only pass laws when there is a compelling practical need. Public<br>
  hysteria is neither compelling nor practical.<br>
<p>
* Pro-cloning opinions have been under-represented, if not altogether<br>
  ignored in the debate. The use of cloning as a valid reproductive option<br>
  has not been addressed.<br>
