     Eliezer wrote (in regards to banal speculations by the "uninformed" <br>
     regarding post-Singularity fashion sense &lt;G&gt;):<br>
     <br>
     Needless to say, I really don't have the faintest idea of what they'll <br>
     come up with.  For all I know, the Back-To-Nature movement could be in <br>
     2040 or 2060; but it's the only fashion trend that I, an unmodified <br>
     human, would be even vaguely able to understand.<br>
     <br>
     I respond:<br>
     <br>
     Eliezer tends to trigger stuff for me (in a good way).  I read  about <br>
     someone's out-of-body visit to a several-milleniums away future where <br>
     entities were not bound to any physical thing.  They inhabited and <br>
     experienced what they pleased.  They kept human bodies preserved in <br>
     membranes that they buried beneath a tree and brought out when they <br>
     wanted to do the human thing.  Otherwise, they would fuse their <br>
     consciousness with any thing: a thunderhead, a salmon, an eagle, the <br>
     wind.  In the case of the fish/eagle thing, they would jump from one <br>
     to the other and co-experience the adrenaline rushes of both the <br>
     hunter and hunted.  The entities *knew* and were expecting their <br>
     visitor from present day Earth.  In fact they could read each other's <br>
     thoughts.  The author noted that there were no children but there were <br>
     animals.  The entities of a much more sparsely populated and <br>
     return-to-nature appearing Earth were preparing to leave the planet.  <br>
     <br>
     I like to think that if/when we upload, our first computers that will <br>
     receive us will be quickly relegated to primitive prosthetics (not <br>
     counting virtual realities which may make the silicon digs more <br>
     comfy).  A handful of things considered, our knowledge and <br>
     capabilities will likely become (what we'd now consider) god-like and <br>
     we will be able to use the sand on a beach, the photons in a moon <br>
     beam, or the drops of water in a cloud to interface with.  Why not?  <br>
     Science meets God and there is no distinction between us and the <br>
     omnipotence we've projected out in front of us for all of human <br>
     civilization.<br>
     <br>
