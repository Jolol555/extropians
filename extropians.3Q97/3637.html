<i>        &gt;It's tides, which derive from  space*time* divergence. </i><br>
                        <br>
<p>
You are unclear, tides was exactly what I was talking about.<br>
<p>

<i>        &gt;When "geodesic lines" diverge in spacetime, the result is different         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;accelerations and tidal effects.  </i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
Exactly, and it's tidal effects on our astronaut that will kill him. The way <br>
geodesic lines behave is a measure of the curvature of spacetime, a measure <br>
of the curvature of anything for that matter.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You make it sound like space is distorted,</i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
It's not space, it's not time, it's spacetime that's curved. I don't use <br>
"distorted", I make no value judgments in this matter. (:&gt;) <br>
                              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;But the Flatlandish metaphor is incorrect,</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I stole the metaphor from Kip Thorne, the Feynman professor of theoretical <br>
physics at the California Institute of Technology, I highly recommend his  <br>
book. The point is that if the flatlanders lived on the surface of a sphere <br>
they could still deduce that their world must be curved in the third <br>
dimension even if they couldn't visualize it. We can't visualize the <br>
curvature of 4 dimensional spacetime but we can deduce it must be happening.<br>
                              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;because Flattime is still flat.</i><br>
                                 <br>
Flattime? <br>
                                              <br>
<i>        &gt;It's the spacetime divergence ("tide") that does it, not spatial         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;geometry.</i><br>
                              <br>
<p>
It's spacetime geometry that does it, and the spacetime geometry is  <br>
proportional to the density of mass (times c^2) in the vicinity plus 3 times <br>
the pressure of matter in the same vicinity, although this last term only <br>
becomes important when the pressure gets astronomical, like in the center of <br>
a neutron star.<br>
       <br>
You make it sound like there is an absolute difference between space and time <br>
and that's incorrect. If you and I are in different reference frames we would <br>
disagree about the distance in space between two events and disagree about <br>
the distance in time between two events but we would always agree on the <br>
spacetime distance between two events. To quote Thorne "your space is a<br>
mixture of my space and my time".                    <br>
