Another thing that has been bouncing around in my head is OTEC.  Try<br>
visualizing how it will work...either the open cycle or the closed cycle<br>
version.  THAT'LL keep you occupied for a few miles....er....hours.<br>
<p>
Anyway...it occurs to me that the tempeture differential between well water<br>
and ambient air temp in many places at many times of the year exceeds the<br>
minimium requirement for OTEC....(only in this case it'd have to be called<br>
something else)...particularly if boosted with a little solar augmentation.<br>
<p>
On the other hand...in the winter in many places the reverse is true...the<br>
well water temp is that much higher than the ambient air temp.<br>
<p>
In either case is a "table top" demo model possible? (or even household power<br>
generation?) Or ....since the reputed effeciency is only 2 or 3<br>
percent...must it be huge to operate at all?<br>
<p>
Just a Thought.<br>
