<i>&gt;Unfortunately, I do not consider myself qualified to defend these claims</i><br>
<i>&gt;sufficiently.  Instead, I will allow the great thinkers to defend their own</i><br>
<i>&gt;claims.</i><br>
<p>
John Stuart Mill never (to my knowledge) called himself a Libertarian. The<br>
term was used exclusively in a theological context until sometime in the<br>
mid-to-late nineteenth century. <br>
<p>
We can't go ask Mill whether he'd have agreed with, say, Harry Browne as a<br>
Presidential candidate.<br>
<p>
I have, for several years now, been developing a personal philosophy that<br>
has some parallels with Libertarianism, without being an "ism". My working<br>
utility function has as its goal the maximization of some sort of product<br>
of two characterological adjectives, rather than one.<br>
<p>
There are people who claim to be Libertarians who disagree about some<br>
fundamentals, such as the Non-Aggression Principle. Which of them are the<br>
_true_ Libertarians? Both? All? How can the ones who claim the NAP is the<br>
defining characteristic of L-ism be as right as the ones who disagree with<br>
that tenet? What about those who claim that refusal to trade constitutes<br>
aggression?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Read them, if you haven't already.  And if you STILL want to argue moral</i><br>
<i>&gt;philosophy, then please provide a point by point demonstration as to why</i><br>
<i>&gt;these political philosophers are wrong.</i><br>
<p>
"Wrong"? I intend to work on what they left out. I don't have time to work<br>
on "Why they are wrong", any more than any other good<br>
experimentalist-theoretician. I am working on "What did they miss?" and<br>
"What did they acknowledge as toughies?". If other people think I'm making<br>
them wrong, that's their perception. I'll argue _my_ moral philosophy, when<br>
it suits, on _my_ time. Listen or not. :)<br>
<p>
One word of advice: if you stand behind a wall of great thinkers, it<br>
decreases your chance of becoming a good one yourself.<br>
