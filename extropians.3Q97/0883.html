Sounds quite inefficient to me; you need a lot of energy to make the<br>
antimatter, why not use that energy for an explosion directly? <br>
<p>
Something that is often overlooked is that almost all the energy in<br>
some explosives come from normal energy sources (hydroelectric,<br>
nuclear, oil etc) which are used to drive chemical reactions during<br>
production (the rest is the chemical energy in the ingredients). So<br>
the plastic explosives from (say) Akzo-Nobel are really hydropowered! <br>
:-) <br>
<p>
As somebody pointed out, antimatter makes a somewhat lousy explosion. <br>
The first reaction between it and the environment produces so much<br>
heat that both turns into a mixed plasma fireball (ambiplasma; I like<br>
that term). Inside the fireball the annihilation rate is lower (since<br>
the density has gone down), so it will remain for a fairly long while<br>
(how long?), radiating hard gamma radiation. Not my weapon of choice<br>
if I wanted a big blast, but if I for some weird reason wanted to<br>
sterilize a continent I might blow it up in the stratosphere.<br>
