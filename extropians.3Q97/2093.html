I agree. However, I think there is a sense in which the opposite may <br>
well be true. (It was not I who made the original statement, though.) <br>
I think that game theoretical considerations *might* show (I am not <br>
at all certain of this yet)  that there will most likely be only one <br>
superintelligence originating from earth. The sense in which game <br>
theory would not apply after the singularity is that there might only <br>
be one agent, and the game he is playing against Nature may be such <br>
that game theory is not at all useful in explaining it.<br>
<p>
What I said in another thread might be relevant here (please forgive <br>
me for quoting myself):<br>
<p>
"We should be on our guard against possible biases that<br>
might make us inclined to believe in something just because it would<br>
be interesting it it were so. (Is this bias toward intellectual<br>
interestingness our equivalent to emotional biases more prominent in<br>
other groups?)"<br>
