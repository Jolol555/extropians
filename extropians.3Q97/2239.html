Women's rights, gay rights - the idea of "rights" is wrong.  It's a way for<br>
the 'white heterosexual males' to *allow* you to be yourself without having<br>
to admit their wrongs.  This 'allowance' is worse than outright<br>
discrimination.  It's the weapon of hypocrites, those who say one thing yet<br>
do another, those who can be your friend yet remain your enemy, and those who<br>
accept yet hate.  It's time we stopped granting rights and started taking<br>
them away.  Such as the right to discriminate, something society and<br>
government passed out many years ago.<br>
<p>
I refuse to accept anyone, because there's nothing to accept.  I refuse to<br>
let minorities be my friends, because they're already welcome.  And I refuse<br>
to give others rights, because they were never wrong.<br>
