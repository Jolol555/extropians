I would be interested to hear your opinions about the following <br>
problem: (and especially Robin Hanson's opinion, since it's close to <br>
his area of expertise)<br>
<p>
How do we best deal with the danger of nuclear proliferation and <br>
the spread of other weapons of  mass destruction?<br>
<p>
It is conceivable, for example, that there will be some early stages <br>
of nanotechnology, before the onset of a singularity-like event, <br>
where nanotechnology could provide destructive powers sufficient to <br>
eliminate all intelligent life on earth. (And this might be before <br>
any significant space-colonization has taken place.)<br>
<p>
One possible answer, of course, is a world government. Does anybody <br>
have what they think is a better idea, or an idea of how best to <br>
implement a world government?<br>
<p>
It seems clear to me that this problem needs to be addressed. I've <br>
heard people defending "each one's right to his or her own nuke", but <br>
that principle seems to me absurd. (Since each nuke could kill more <br>
than a million people, and there probably are more than one <br>
per million who would use his nuke, it would kill all of us.)<br>
