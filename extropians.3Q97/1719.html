 I've been slowly but steadily improving my diet. For example, 10 years<br>
ago I ate 1 pound of beef and well over a pound of sugar in a typical<br>
week, and never ate broccoli. Now I eat broccoli fairly often, have reduced<br>
my beef intake by at least an order of magnitude, and my sugar intake by<br>
a factor of about 2.<br>
 I'm taking quite a few vitamins and related supplements.<br>
 I make some attempt to exercise regularly.<br>
 I've also gotten around to signing up for cryonics.<br>

 Is there any evidence that filtering water is important?<br>

<p>
 The idea that health food is necessarily expensive probably indicates<br>
a poor definition of health food. I generally find the unhealthy foods<br>
I'm cutting down on (beef, ice cream, chocolate bars, potato chips)<br>
cost more money on average than the foods I'm trying to eat more of<br>
(bananas, broccoli, sweet potatoes, carrots). Of course, the preparation<br>
time for healthy foods is much higher, and probably deters some overworked<br>
extropians.<br>
