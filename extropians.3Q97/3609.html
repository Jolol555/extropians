<i>&gt; Rick Knight writes</i><br>
<i>&gt; My largest incongruity with the classic Extropian viewpoint (as</i><br>
<i>&gt; expressed on this digest) is a seeming lack of humanity and</i><br>
<i>&gt; connectedness.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think "incongruity" works here either.  It's at best a<br>
misperception, and at worst a malicious slander.  I don't think<br>
anyone who has ever personally been with a group of Extropians<br>
and gotten to know them would call us anything but compassionate.<br>
I do not wish to devalue my true compassion by hiding behind<br>
emotional rhetoric instead of the plain language of reason; but<br>
if doing so in some cases helps the cause, then I must consider<br>
it, because I value results above motives.<br>
<p>
If the worthless bleeding hearts whose policies of self-sacrifice<br>
/cause/ hunger and homelessness accuse us of being unkind because<br>
we can see beyond their teary-eyed dogma, then perhaps it is in our<br>
interest to better tune our language to their limited minds.  I do<br>
not for a second forgive the cult of faith, hope, and charity for<br>
its crimes against humanity; their good intentions are no excuse.<br>
But I do not have to forgive them to work with them to achieve<br>
the result we both claim to share--prosperity for everyone--and<br>
to use the compassion they claim to have to help the very real<br>
compassion that we cave.<br>
<p>
Greg's essay is a good example.  While the more mathematically-<br>
minded of us might complain of a certain lack of rigor, or that<br>
Axelrod's result is only a starting point to understanding the<br>
more detailed ways that cooperative behaviors can emerge as<br>
evolutionarily stable strategies, and the more complex ways in<br>
which we can drive memetic evolution toward desirable ESSs, I<br>
think it does set the right tone for the masses.  The Bioarchive<br>
project language is another good example.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, I'm not very good at such language, and neither<br>
are many of us.  I also don't see this particular private list<br>
as the proper venue for it; this list is for those of us already<br>
committed to the cause, and plain, provocative language gets<br>
the point across much faster.  But perhaps this episode will<br>
help us work on our public image a bit.<br>
