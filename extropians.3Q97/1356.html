In a message dated 97-07-30 10:43:20 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 I think it is a bit stupid to mistrust *everything* the government<br>
 says - one has to apply sceptical thinking here too. A sceptic<br>
 doesn't believe in what he hears, and he doesn't doubt it either. He<br>
 tries to find out if it is true or not.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
So color me stupid....in thirty years of greater or lesser experience with my<br>
government I've learned....the hard way...not to trust them.  They lie.<br>
<p>
No offense.<br>
<p>
Back on the subject.  I can only go by what I read.  What I read is that<br>
papers are submitted to the above mentioned Journals....and are rejected out<br>
of hand....not being familar with the process I can only speculate.<br>
