<i>&gt; &gt; The easiest way to "explain" that is to point out that it's bullshit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Life has never been better.  Health has never been better.  The poor</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  have never been as rich as they are now...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Please, I hate to enter into it with you, because I know who i am arguing</i><br>
<i>&gt; with, but how can someone be poor AND rich at the same time?</i><br>
<p>
I meant something like "The wealth, in absolute magnitude, of those<br>
who are presently called 'the poor' far exceeds the wealth of those who<br>
were called 'the poor' in earlier times...(and some who weren't)"<br>
<p>
Such is the English language: that would have been clearer and less<br>
ambiguous is Lojban, but far less poetic.  I'm not above using<br>
deliberate ambiguity for rhetorical effect now and then; I don't<br>
think I was trying to be deceptive.<br>
