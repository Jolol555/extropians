Re:  The Future of Gender<br>
It's too bad I wasn't there.  Among the issues I would like to have raised:<br>
<p>
1.  Emotional differences between genders arise from differing evolutionary<br>
cost-benefit ratios.  Given certain new methods of reproduction, what would be<br>
the corresponding emotional changes?  Given a new "gender" which reproduced<br>
its ideas into the child's mind, would any new evolved emotions arise?  What<br>
about triple sexuality?<br>
<p>
2.  What if we're not evolving emotions?  If we design them ourselves, would<br>
we want to invent any new emotions?  How would this affect social interaction?<br>
 Suppose parents are required by law to be incapable, emotionally, of harming<br>
their child... how would this affect dating?  Might not both partners circle<br>
cautiously to ensure a potential child would not be harmed by the other?<br>
<p>
3.  How would thoughtsharing of various types affect sexual mores?  Define an<br>
Augmented human as a "primary" human supported by several other experts<br>
sharing the world through virtual reality and communicating continuously,<br>
waking and sleeping, on subvocal/subconscious/hypnotic channels.  (Augmented<br>
humans are addressed as "Augmented Sally" to emphasize that you're talking to<br>
everyone, not just Sally.)  If Augmented Sally and Augmented Fred have sex,<br>
how would this affect the Augmentations, which could be of mixed genders?<br>
<p>
4.  What if a liberal administration required that everyone switch sexes once<br>
per year, to eliminate prejudice?  Would people stick with their old emotions,<br>
switch to the new, or go nuts?<br>
<p>
Note that none of these questions address uploading.<br>
You all know why...<br>

The whole missed opportunity reminds me of another time...
[From an SF convention I once attended:]
<p>
A friend once gave a lecture on "Spoken Programming Languages" that I sort of
had to rescue.  Among the questions I asked from the audience:
<p>
"What is the cognitive difference between speaking and writing, and how will
it affect the computer languages?"
"Would spoken comments, recorded directly, be an improvement?"
<p>
Among other things, I suggested that you'd need super-macros so you could say
"copy A into B".  Another nice fellow in the audience wondered whether spoken
Logo would produce the same cognitive improvement... learning to program in
Logo is apparently VERY good at increasing a child's mental agility.
<p>
Previous to my throwing away all caution and asking these questions, my friend
and the other panelist were discussing error correction and speaker
dependence.  Dull, and not what everyone had shown up to hear.

So if you're giving a lecture and want a lot of neat "What-if?" speculations,
just give me a ring!  I can provide them in unlimited numbers, just for the asking!
