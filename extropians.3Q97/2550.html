<p>
I think my school experience helped with this.  I learned to negotiate for<br>
all the wrong reasons.  Getting out of trouble was an art form and comes in<br>
useful in everyday life.  When I was at school me and some friends were<br>
planning for a life of crime, social engineering of teachers was perfect<br>
practise and we became so good at it we could get away with anything.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I feel left out.  (I usually feel left out, dammit.)</i><br>
<p>
Me too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I never got beat up, scrawny though I was.</i><br>
<p>
I was only ever on the other end of the stick - the end with the comfy grip -<br>
which will win me no friends on this list.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  In third or fourth grade I once fought Peter Benesch one-on-one.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  (Gave him a black eye, or so he claimed; I never saw the shiner.)</i><br>
<p>
In my early school years I got to do all the beating, after which I was<br>
nuetral.  There's something to be said for kicking the shit out of people<br>
*before* they get to an age when they can do serious damage.  By the time I<br>
got high school all those kids I use to beat up where much bigger than me,<br>
but they left me alone.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Fifth/sixth grade (different town) was marginally worse.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  On one occasion during recess my peers pushed me into a "fight" with </i><br>
<i>&gt;  a classmate's kid sister.</i><br>
<p>
Who won?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  On my way home a neighborhood bully tried on two occasions to pick </i><br>
<i>&gt;  a fight, but I baffled him by not knowing the conventions.  I suppose</i><br>
<i>&gt;  he decided I was a sissy not worth scuffing his shoes.</i><br>
<p>
Every fight I've been in has ended with the other kid coming up with an<br>
excuse to leave, or my friend switching in to 'psycho' mode and deciding to<br>
bring bricks into the equation (A psychotic friend is a must for anyone<br>
entering public school).<br>
<p>
I did once get attacked by a man weilding a bag full of shopping.  After<br>
which we waited around for two weeks to see where he lived so we could<br>
firebomb his house, but he never came back :-(<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  And - I almost forgot - while waiting for the school bus in the morning,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I once stood by impotent while bullies made my sister lick spit off the </i><br>
<i>&gt;  pavement.</i><br>
<p>
Nice!<br>
<p>
For me school was 5% fun (joking, burning, breaking, stealing, hurting and<br>
blowing things up), 70% boredom, and 25% that I didn't attend (I missed about<br>
3 years because I couldn't cope with the 70% boredom).  But I never had as<br>
bad a time as many of the people on this list.  This is no reason to say it's<br>
a good thing, even if we had all had a great experience at public school<br>
there would still be room for improvement.<br>
