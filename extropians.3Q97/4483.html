Those who force children into concentration-campuses-for-mind-destruction<br>
are obviously not playing with a full-deck.  Same goes for those who merely<br>
threaten parents to submit the child or "face the consequences." Same goes <br>
for those who merely *scribbled* pretended "laws" making involuntary servitude<br>
"legal" (so-called) and said that I have to participate in the game whether I like<br>
it or not (Ha Ha Ha, very funny. Yea, OK, right, what ever you say Master).<br>
<p>
Coercion is a sign of weakness. Those who believe the *words* of tyrants are<br>
just creating problems for themselves and loved ones. <br>
