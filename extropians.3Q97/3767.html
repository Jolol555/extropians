<i>&gt;I mentioned in an earlier post Nietzsche's suggestion that generosity can</i><br>
<i>&gt;come from not pity but from an overflowing of power and well-being.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Similarly, I suspect that psychological healthy people, having removed</i><br>
<i>&gt;their own suffering, will often be inclined to exercise some of their</i><br>
<i>&gt;talents on those who still suffer (at least where they can do this with</i><br>
<i>&gt;some chance of success). They may do this partly for the directly</i><br>
<i>&gt;self-interested reasons you mention, or simply because it's a rewarding and</i><br>
<i>&gt;challenging exercise of their talents.</i><br>

A penetrating observation, Max, and one that coincides with my<br>
experience.<br>
<p>
I would also add the following: Although this is only based on my own<br>
subjective experience (and not on anything approximating controlled or<br>
rigorous empirical study, even if it was possible in this sort of area -<br>
of which I a far from sure) it has struck me that most of the<br>
"compassion mongers", the lefties who are forever regaling us with<br>
accounts of their own virtues and the malevolence of their opponents,<br>
seem to be almost universally obnoxious, and venemously unpleasant in<br>
their own personal behaviour. Their lives alos often seem to be<br>
disfunctional and chaotic (even when they are superficially successsful<br>
in careers) and characterised by ressentiment and what Reich so<br>
penetratingly called the "emotional plague". <br>
<p>
Although I've come across some pretty obnoxious advocates of freedom as<br>
well I've never observed the same general extent of personal<br>
viciousness. Moreover, the sort of unpleasantness I'm talking about is<br>
not confined merely to political statists of "left" or "right", but is<br>
manifest by control freaks of all sorts - health fascists, feminazis,<br>
religionists etc. Advocates of liberty rarely seem to make such a<br>
brouhaha over their own meritoriousness. It's almost as if the statists<br>
are really aware, in a subconscious way, of the real nature of their<br>
characters and impulses - their anti-life and malevolent nature - and<br>
are compensating by their incessant moralising. It reminds me of that<br>
saying (Oscar Wilde?) that (from memory) when someone starts professing<br>
their honesty that is the time to check your silver.<br>
<p>
It is unfortunate that so many libertarians are fixated on economics and<br>
political philsophy. The need for a radically libertarian psychology and<br>
social psychology - and its application in methods of social change - is<br>
urgent. (Andre Spies/Fredrick Mann made an interesting start in some of<br>
his writings of the 1970s).<br>
