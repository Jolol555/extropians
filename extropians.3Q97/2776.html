"Rick Knight" &lt;rknight@platinum.com&gt; comments:<br>
     <br>
<i>&gt; However, I consider that the circles, whether they be hoaxes done</i><br>
<i>&gt;by clever humans or cryptic messages from an advances off-world</i><br>
<i>&gt;race, to be a fascinating phenomenon, at least archetypally and</i><br>
<i>&gt;sociologically. Some "hoaxes" are deliberate, confessed after the</i><br>
<i>&gt;fact to be so, not to discredit but to continue a dialog in</i><br>
<i>&gt;earnest.  The human-made circles I'm told are often done with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;utmost reverence, employing sacred geometry, considering time and</i><br>
<i>&gt;location thoughtfully and planned out for months in advance.</i><br>
     <br>
 Two of the best known "crop circlists" in the world admitted that<br>
their motivation was a bottle of whiskey. After the first time they<br>
began figuring out more complex patterns and ways of achieving<br>
them. The documentary I watched on this (don't recall the name) was<br>
quite well done, they demonstrated the whole procedure, from<br>
conception to actually completing the design. They had a notebook<br>
showing a history of the designs they had done.<br>
<p>
There is a crop expert (British I believe) who routinely goes out<br>
to these sights and confirms their man made origins.  <br>
<p>
 During the later part of the seventies, some service buddies of<br>
mine and myself use to amuse ourselves by faking UFO sightings and<br>
landings. Our primary UFO was a flying saucer shaped hot air ballon<br>
kit from Edmund Scientific or American Science center in Chicago.<br>
With a few modifications (and a piece or two of radar chaff) our<br>
little pranks made more than one radar screen.......<br>
<p>
The landings were no more difficult, although we never messed with<br>
anyones crops, marshy areas were our favorite target. The old<br>
"stake in the middle with a piece of rope" was our prefered circle<br>
method. The marshes were particularly good because incoming tidal<br>
flow erased the footprints and stakemarks.<br>
<p>
One of our innovations was using a mildly radioactive mineral we<br>
used to get from a geological supply house in North Carolina, we<br>
would crush it to a powder with a big alloy casting we had around<br>
the shop, then sprinkle it inside our circles. The actual level of<br>
radioactivity was very small, something like barely twice<br>
background, just enough to make the needle kick.....<br>
<p>
Heh Heh Lots of fun!!<br>
<p>
We got the idea after noticing how UFO sightings in the west went<br>
up during the time our Harrier squadrons were at the Nevada,<br>
Arizona bombing ranges.<br>

P.S. Take it with a grain of salt if you ever see a story about "The Lake<br>
Michigan Monster."   ;)<br>
