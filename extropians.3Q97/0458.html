Most private arbitration agreements do not choose to use juries.  For<br>
a few exceptions, see the p. B1 article in the Mon, 7 Jul 1997 Wall<br>
Street Journal (7/7/97), "Private Jury Trials: Cheap, Quick,<br>
Controversial."<br>
<p>
Juries seem to be one of those extra expenses and inefficiencies one<br>
may attribute to state, vs. private, law.  We don't trust state law<br>
enough not to use juries, but customers do seem to trust their private<br>
laws enough to only use them rarely.<br>
<p>
Btw, I was on jury duty a few weeks ago and the judge explicitly<br>
mentioned nullification, explained its meaning, and then asked if<br>
anyone had problems with ignoring that idea.  None did.  Either most<br>
people lie about this, or there really isn't much public support for<br>
the idea.<br>
