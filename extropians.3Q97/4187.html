Well, as I said, my justifications are not terribly convincing. However I<br>
still think answer set B is correct. I will think about this some more and<br>
give a complete analysis later. In the mean time here are two more reasons<br>
to prefer answer set B over A.<br>
<p>
1. If the subject's answer to question 3 is a3, then he should be willing<br>
to accept the following bet after giving his answer: if the coin landed<br>
up, he loses 1/a3 dollars, else he wins 1/(1-a3) dollars. But if a3&lt;1/2,<br>
the experimenter has a positive expected profit from running the<br>
experiment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; This set of answers may seem counter-intuitive because you will observe</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; before he goes to sleep and say "the probability that the coin landed head</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; up is 2/3" immediately after he wakes up. However the alternative is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; equally counter-intuitive. If answer set A is correct, and suppose the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; copying process is slightly defective so that the original can tell that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; he is not a clone when he wakes up, then you will observe the subject say</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "the probability that the coin will land head up is 1/2" before he goes to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sleep and say "the probability that the coin landed head up is 1/3"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; immediately after he wakes up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The original subject will say "the probability that the coin landed head up is</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1/3".  The cloned subject, if any, will say "the coin landed head up".  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; changes balance out.</i><br>
<p>
2. You believe that the original subject will say 1/3 if the effect of<br>
coin landing head up is a slightly defective clone, and 1/2 if the effect<br>
is water boiling. What about something in between? What if the clone is 1%<br>
defective? 10% defective? What if the clone is killed immediately after he<br>
wakes up? I think the only consistent way of thinking about this is to say<br>
that the subject believes the probability of heads is 1/2 if he is certain<br>
that he is not a clone.<br>
