I am sorry that you had this experience, but if you are going to <br>
contest my statement, contest it in full.  I made it very clear in <br>
the sentence following my statement above that adults should step <br>
into a situation that is dangerous for the child.  Your example does <br>
nothing to obviate the need for crucial socialization into <br>
assertiveness skills, and I also never stated that a home schooling <br>
parent could not provide those settings necessary for that type of <br>
development.  <br>
<p>
Also, one need not "throw onto a playground" any child for that child <br>
to encounter bullies or other threatening types, and certainly some <br>
sort of training is necessary for every child to deal with bad <br>
situations.  But I think that is a highly obvious point and not worth <br>
discussing in detail.<br>
