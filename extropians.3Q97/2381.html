     As a relatively intelligent person with a sensitive personality and a <br>
     puny physique growing up, I empathize with those who had to endure <br>
     cruelty from other children in schoolyard situations.  Either you were <br>
     met with admonition from teachers to toughen up or you were <br>
     mollycoddled by them (making things worse).<br>
     <br>
     With the advent of two-way fiber optic telecommunications, I think it <br>
     would behoove us to start forming small collectives.  Not every parent <br>
     wishes to work outside the house and there are certainly a number of <br>
     adults with a desire to instruct and assist young minds as they grow.<br>
     <br>
     Wouldn't it be grand if we could have small neighborhood home schools <br>
     with maybe six kids using the TV, PC, even the Nintendo as interactive <br>
     tools to get information?  As laptops become more the norm, it could <br>
     become as common a school supply as a compass or ruler (over <br>
     simplification alert, I know).  I'm speaking of those parents with the <br>
     capability of organizing such groups.  It compels us to personalize <br>
     education, get along better with one another, negotiate disputes not <br>
     only between children's conflicts but parents.  We tend to have such a <br>
     "take our toys and go home" attitude in this culture when we don't get <br>
     our way.  The art of comprimise is woefully lacking.<br>
     <br>
     Even as an adult, my desire to learn is greatly stimulated by the <br>
     information becoming more and more available on the Internet.  In the <br>
     mind of a conscientious child, how much more would that desire be <br>
     present?<br>
     <br>
     There are all kinds of negative factors to discuss along with this: <br>
     the dysfunctional child that doesn't respond to reason or discipline, <br>
     the inequality that stems from those in a class with access to hi-tech <br>
     and those in the poorer classes that don't.  But as far as <br>
     Extropian-minded individuals and their children, I think banding <br>
     together and forming small educational groups for their kids would be <br>
     a good start towards taking back control of education, which at least <br>
     in the public sector, seems to be very mismanaged, disoriented by <br>
     crime and social dysfunction and poorly funded.<br>
     <br>
