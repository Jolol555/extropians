Rick Knight &lt;rknight@platinum.com&gt;, thanks for your comments:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; With all due respect, it takes little reading between the lines to</i><br>
<i>&gt; see that your religious upbringing has you by the short hairs.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather dubious challenge "In a thousand years we'll know who is</i><br>
<i>&gt; right" falls about as intellectually and motivationally flat as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; religious rhetoric I continue to get from my "dog and pony show"</i><br>
<i>&gt; religious relatives.</i><br>
<p>
	I guess I don't see it this way.  True, this is twisted a bit<br>
and we don't know, absolutely, that we, as individuals will be some of<br>
the few that will make it to that time in a viable state but I think<br>
there is a very good chance that at least some people, making efforts<br>
like prepairing to have themselves cryonically preserved and so on<br>
will make it.  Or at a very minimum, the research that results from<br>
their efforts will bring eternal life sooner for some.  Much sooner<br>
than simply "praying" or waiting for God and such will ever do.  To<br>
me, it is an almost absolute fact that immortality will come some<br>
time.  It's just a matter of when we can finally accomplish the<br>
necessary research and development.<br>
<p>
	Also, this kind of "rhetoric" and threats of hellfire and<br>
damnation is the only thing some of these kinds of people respond to.<br>
They think religion easily wins in the "one-upmanship" of the<br>
"faithful" but I find just the opposite to be true.  In all areas from<br>
faith to hope to the naturally miraculous... extropianism is millions<br>
of times ONE-upmanship of any religion I know of.  If people could<br>
just hear the rational truth instead of all the twisted logic<br>
propaganda.  Religion is the one that tells them science means death,<br>
but this is now a lie.  Successfully communicating the truth and<br>
remove this single "one-up" item and I bet the tables will quickly<br>
turn for many people.  "Don't give up in despair and accept that there<br>
must be death and suffering even when there is an all powerful God,<br>
have faith that, with a bit more power than what man now has, death<br>
and suffering, as we know know it, can be eliminated!"<br>
<p>
	It's more or less saying that you must make a choice between<br>
religion and science.  Some claim salvation only comes from religion<br>
and others say it only comes from science.  Pointing out that everyone<br>
agrees that making the wrong choice has critical long term<br>
implications seems very motivational to me.  Who do you really<br>
believe?  Science or religion?  Many people claim they have more faith<br>
in religion, but when it comes right down to real actions they choose<br>
science.  Do you go to a church first, and then a hospital when you<br>
are critically injured and dieing or the other way around?  Make the<br>
wrong choice (i.e. today, some go to a church and/or pray before they<br>
go to a hospital...), and you will, according to what can be<br>
rationally observed, end up dead.  Thankfully, most people choose a<br>
hospital before some church.  Successfully communicate to them that<br>
they now have this same choice with death and I bet many actions will<br>
drastically change in spite of their proclaimed beliefs in the<br>
irrational.<br>
<p>
	EvMick &lt;EvMick@aol.com&gt; commented about forcing people to do<br>
what is right:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Bill Clinton certainly thinks so...as did Stalin, Idi Amin, Hitler,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Gehghis Khan, Sadam Husein, Fidel Castro, ....................</i><br>
<p>
	The problem is, knowing what is right.  Forcing people to do<br>
what is right might be ok IF you are absolutely right about what is<br>
right for that person.  No one would place a mother that forcefully<br>
prevents a toddler from wondering into a street full of speeding cars<br>
would place her in with these people for such a freedom denying<br>
action.  The problem is, most people who think they know what is right<br>
are really seriously mistaken, especially when it comes to what is<br>
right for other people.<br>
<p>
	Who was it that said: "We are condemned to be free"?<br>
