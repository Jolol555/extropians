&lt;&lt; Speech to text programs have gotten a lot better in the last few years but<br>
<p>
 text to speech programs have not, they sound as bad as they did 5 years ago.<br>
<p>
 I'm not talking about nuances in inflection or voice fonts, if it sounded as<br>
<p>
 well as a half asleep human with a bad tooth and a head cold I'd be happy.  <br>
 I'm no expert on either technology but it would seem to me that text to <br>
 speech would be much easier than the other way round, yet less progress has <br>
 been made, anybody know why?                           <br>

All they need to do is to get someone to record their voice for each word,<br>
probably a few different times, with different stresses each time.  The<br>
problem comes in assembling the grammar to fit which stressed words should be<br>
used.  Does typical grammar apply here or are there new forms of language<br>
composition/evaluation that can be applied?<br>
