I confess that my attention is limited, too, Mr. <br>
Forste, and that in my experience, simple, direct<br>
speech is prized by most of the people I respect.<br>
<p>
Mr. Genen seems to be more attuned to making<br>
orotund, supercilious-sounding pronouncements <br>
than to direct response. Rather like excerpts from<br>
"Yes, Minister". His proud yet veiled description <br>
of his years spent crafting an ever-more-snug <br>
creche of laws for all of us to be cradled in<br>
may point to a cause. OTOH...<br>
<p>
Perhaps this obliqueness is evidence that we<br>
really are blessed with a stranger in our midst.<br>
"Didn't know what principled argumentation was..."<br>
<p>
Possibly he knows how to decode the 18 hours of<br>
"noise" recorded by a certain head-mounted camera.<br>
<p>
Then again, the best way to yank someone's chain<br>
is to pretend you're not doing it. Diplomatic<br>
provocation, more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger, <br>
contrived urbanity, that sort of thing<br>
I suggest we all give Mr. Genen enough chain <br>
that tension is hard to apply. If it's just a <br>
"brainsizing" exercise, he'll tire of it <br>
and wander off soon, if not soon enough.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, step up preparations for Plan B.<br>
<p>
Killfiles? Let's not be rude and announce them.<br>
<p>
"Interesting thought -- and worth pondering and expanding upon in the<br>
greater social context."<br>

Dear Michael and other fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
A long, long time ago a great man named Robert Moses (who accomplished a<br>
great deal despite the continuous criticism of a herd of worthless<br>
do-nothings) told me that no matter what you do or try to do there will<br>
usually be at least three people who will try to stop you from doing that<br>
which you believe is right.<br>
<p>
I have no reason to be ashamed of my accomplishments. If anything, I am,<br>
in fact, proud of the many things I've done and/or tried to do in the<br>
public interest.<br>
<p>
For those who wish to kvetch, however, that is your right. Please be so<br>
kind and  do me the courtesy of advising me what you have actually done<br>
beyond dialogue to advance the cause of the human condition.<br>
<p>
Enjoy!!!<br>
<p>
