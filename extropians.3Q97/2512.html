And without wiping itself out in the process; somehow the 'gray goo' has<br>
to determine whether that object it's dismantling is another 'gray goo'<br>
nanite, and once we find out how it's doing that we can fake it. Suddenly<br>
we're immune... (computer viruses have precisely the same problem). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So, what are the obvious holes? </i><br>
<p>
The only obvious one is that an attacker could duplicate the markings of a<br>
valid cell and would then be safe from the immune system. If we all use<br>
different markings then this would require an lot of work on the part of<br>
the attacker. <br>
<p>
Of course the simplest way to avoid these kind of attacks is simply to not<br>
be there. All the current discussions seem to imply that we'll stay here<br>
on Earth just waiting for some maniac to wipe us out (and there are plenty<br>
of ways to do that *without* nanotech). There are certainly disadvantages<br>
to zooming off into the cosmos with a group of people you trust, but it<br>
will be a damn sight safer than staying down here.<br>
<p>
As far as I can see there are really only two solutions if such a<br>
'nanotech catastrophe' is possible; either the Borg or the Armadillos --<br>
one sentient entity takes over the universe and eliminates or absorbs any<br>
competitors who might harm it, or we live in deep space in small,<br>
heavily-armed groups and treat anyone we meet with great distrust.<br>
Nicholas seems to be on the side of the Borg, whereas personally I'm for<br>
the Armadillos; I can think of few things worse than being the only entity<br>
in the universe. <br>
