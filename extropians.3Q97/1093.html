Here's my theory: money.  Whoever gets the first really good speech-to-text<br>
product out there is going to make tons of money.  Contrairiwise,<br>
text-to-speech is clearly only going to make a few hundred kilos of money.<br>
Hence, the smart money is investing in improving speech-to-text.  <br>
<p>
Some anecdotal evidence toward this point: I know three people who are<br>
working on speech-to-text (and I know them by three different routes, so<br>
it's not a circle of friends).  I don't know *anyone* working on text-to-speech.<br>
<p>
There may also be an element of 'the good is the enemy of the best': present<br>
day text-to-speech is good enough to understand, so the motivation for<br>
improving it is less than for speech-to-text, where present day tech is<br>
still annoyingly inaccurate.<br>
