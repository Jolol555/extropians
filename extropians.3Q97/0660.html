     I would regard a third world shepherd as a leaver, a western world<br>
     rancher as a taker.  The distinction being on their overall impact on<br>
     the world at large.  The shepherd's flock might eat up the grass in a<br>
     meadow which locally may locally impact the population but a modern<br>
     cattle facility can spoil groundwater and produce over abundant<br>
     amounts of methane, not to mention how much grain it takes to feed the<br>
     cattle that one doesn't get back nutritionally or substantively in the<br>
     resultant meat or dairy consumption for which the cattle are raised.<br>
<p>
Your low-impact shepherds stripped the Mediterranean of its trees<br>
and enlarged the Sahara.<br>
