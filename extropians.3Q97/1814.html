In a message dated 97-08-12 12:40:48 EDT, you write: <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; In my estimation, average municipal water quality, governed by a  <br>
      bogged down and likely indifferent bureaucratic system is about as  <br>
      safe as packaged meat...but we'll save that for another topic &lt;G&gt;. <br>
<i>       &gt;&gt; </i><br>
     I design and test water systems.  I have seen my share of horror<br>
stories.  There are well meaning people trying to fix the water system<br>
problems.  As I see it, the municipal systems are run by people who generally<br>
know what they are doing.  The problem is somewhat with the government<br>
environmental laws. The laws are too strict for the currently (maybe nanotech<br>
filters later) available technology with some types of *natural* chemical<br>
contamination.   <br>
     For now, I suggest using a bottled water company.  I (think I) know who<br>
is good and not-so-good.  The FDA inspects these plants and the poor<br>
companies get forced into being (temporarily?) better.  You should see the<br>
turmoil when the FDA police inspect a plant, what a shake up.  [Why can't the<br>
economics keep these companies in line?  Why do we need the FDA to go in with<br>
big guns?] <br>
     Anyway,  the municipalities tend to forget about what they can not<br>
control (chemicals) and concentrate on the one EPA law I *do* agree with:<br>
40CFR _Escherichia coli_ elimination and total coliform control which is (in<br>
general) &lt;1 per 100 mL.  So, I guess that makes water safer from a<br>
microbiological aspect than ground beef. <br>
