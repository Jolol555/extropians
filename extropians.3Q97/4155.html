The free market punishes stupidity and inefficiency.  This is good.  But<br>
it also fails to reward producing information for free, or exploration,<br>
which is bad if people need that reward to live.  Copyright fills in the<br>
gap, but less than ideally, because it makes information not free for a<br>
while.<br>
<p>
A system which could afford to support its entire population for little<br>
effort can afford much exploration and research and art.  This is good.<br>
But it can fail to punish inefficiency or population growth faster than<br>
productivity growth, until the system collapses.  This is bad.  Or could<br>
be bad; possibly it wouldn't be a real problem.  Western birthrates have<br>
been dropping, and maybe people would adopt more efficient measures<br>
because those felt more elegant.  But I'm not sanguine about the<br>
problem, as Banks is.  <br>
<p>
Is there a fix?  And is it reachable from current society?  I dunno.<br>
But this is what I've been getting at.<br>

He played as the Culture.  He'd habitually set up something like the<br>
society itself when he constructed his positions and deployed his<br>
pieces; a net, a grid of forces and relationships, without any obvious<br>
hierarchy or entrenched leadership, and initially quite profoundly<br>
peaceful.<br>
