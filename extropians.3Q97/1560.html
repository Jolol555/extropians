     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     Having waited until the age of 34 to have transpersonal experiences <br>
     through psychedelics, I can say that those with a lot of emotional <br>
     baggage and unresolved stuff will have the hardest time with these <br>
     drugs (not counting ecstasy, the current drug of choice in the gen-X <br>
     rave community).  Mushroom, acid, peyote and other potent psychedelic <br>
     experiences are not for the immature or unwise.  They should be <br>
     regarded with respect.  <br>
     <br>
     Regardless of whether they bring more potent meaning to brain "noise" <br>
     or if they provide a trasponder to alternative realities is not of <br>
     consequence to me.  After a few of my own excursions, I gave up trying <br>
     to bring back useful information and instead assimilated the <br>
     experience into honing my perception of the world.  It has served to <br>
     make me a wiser, mellower and more optimistic person.  This may be <br>
     coincidental with me reaching mid-life but there's no denying (in my <br>
     mind) the positive role that psychedelics played (and would continue <br>
     to play were their acquisition not so much a chore for middle-class <br>
     middle-aged guys like me) for me in my life.<br>
     <br>
     For the uncared for and misunderstood to take psychedelics is for them <br>
     to unwittingly enter a pretty intense psychotherapy ritual.  Depending <br>
     upon the depth of their dysfunction, their inability to deal with the <br>
     meanings that form over the course of their trip can have devastating <br>
     results which is why it's been so easy for establishment to <br>
     illegitimize their value because of the danger they pose to young <br>
     people (often the more vulnerable and emotionally charged).<br>
     <br>
