Yes, a potential problem.  But, if the rest of us (not desiring to <br>
control, or be controlled) are in close agreement on how things should be <br>
done, we would have sufficient protection against would-be politicians.<br>

Er, right, an un-desirable thing.  Did we understand each other here?<br>

Good point.  The key, then, is that most of the citizens can understand <br>
and perhaps "remember" the constitution in most of its details.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course, that need not mean</i><br>

I see this document as being quite alterable, like a letter in a word<br>
processing program, it gets refined in place.  Amendments are messy, space<br>
consuming, and cause arguments.  Who need's 'em. <br>
