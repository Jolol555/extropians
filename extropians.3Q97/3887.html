I can name 3 examples in which people successfully defended themselves against<br>
genocide with small arms: the Israeli War of Independence, 1948; the overthrow<br>
of the Hutus by the Ruwandan Patriotic Front in 1994; &amp; the reversal of the<br>
gains made by the Bosnian Serbs in the Balkan War, again in the early 1990s -<br>
can't recall exactly which year.<br>
<p>
In Palestine in 1948, the Israelis were up against a pal of Himmler's who'd<br>
been appointed Mufti of Palestine by the British who was about to attack them<br>
with tens of thousands of Arab troops in a campaign to totally exterminate the<br>
Jews from Palestine.  Thanks to shipments of Czech small arms, under orders<br>
from Stalin, David Ben-Gurion was able to launch a pre-emptive strike that<br>
bought him the time to build up the strength the Israelis needed in order to<br>
survive.<br>
<p>
In Ruwanda, after President Habayarimana was killed in a plane crash that was<br>
blamed on a Tutsi missile (but may have actually been shot down by a Hutu<br>
attack), the two Hutu-government controlled paramilitary forces launched a<br>
campaign to exterminate the Tutsis, enlising the support of much of the Hutu<br>
civilian populace.  After mass-murdering 500,000 people in 100 DAYS, they<br>
were stopped when the Hutu government was overthrown by the Tutsi rebels, the<br>
Ruwandan Patriotic Front, which had been receiving arms from outside the<br>
country.  Needless to say, the Tutsis were not legally allowed to carry guns,<br>
&amp; most of them were murdered with machetes.<br>
<p>
In the Balkan War, the Bosnian Moslems were fighting a losing battle until they<br>
got arms &amp; advisers from Iran, at which point they not only stopped the Bosnian<br>
Serb's onslaught of "ethnic cleansing," in which gang rape &amp; torture were the<br>
chosen instruments of terrorizing the Moslems into retreat, but actually<br>
recaptured some lost ground.  Then, all of a sudden, the Bosnian Serbs started<br>
saying: "What's that?  NATO &amp; the UN want us to make peace?  What a good idea!<br>
Why didn't we think of that sooner?"<br>
<p>
By way of contrast, every single major genocide this century has been of a<br>
victim group which has been previously disarmed by law.  Jews for the Preserva-<br>
tion of Firearms Ownership has published a book documenting this, called<br>
"Lethal Laws."<br>
<p>
"If guns are outlawed, only the government will have guns. Only the police,<br>
the secret police, the military, the hired servants of our rulers. Only the<br>
government--and a few outlaws.  I intend to be among the outlaws."<br>
	--Edward Abbey (1927-1989), _Abbey's Road,_ p.39_(Plume, 1979)<br>
