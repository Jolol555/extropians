No, the official line is still the balloon. They only mentioned the<br>
dummies when the saucer freaks said 'Nah, nah, what about the bodies<br>
then?'. Of course it was hugely counter-productive because the dummies<br>
weren't dropped until the fifties; the Air Force folks were taking the<br>
perfectly sensible step of thinking that perhaps people had seen the<br>
dummies in the fifties but were confused about the date, given that, after<br>
all, these tales are nearly fifty years old. They clearly don't understand<br>
the believers' mindset... <br>
<p>
Which also goes to support my point about the Air Force being far too<br>
inept to cover up aliens for fifty years. An Air Force which could do that<br>
would at least lie and claim that it dropped the dummies in the forties,<br>
or just make up another explanation and fake documentation for it. <br>
