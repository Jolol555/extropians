I would have to disagree.  Decision by consensus makes poor business sense<br>
and becomes increasingly unusable as the number of individuals increases.<br>
Although it produces arguably more intelligent results, the process is<br>
simply too slow and tedious to be responsive to the market.  A team of<br>
people does not have the focus and direction that a single over-riding<br>
individual (manager) can give, and cannot make decisions as quickly.<br>
<p>
A model that works better is a consensual heirarchy i.e. a group of<br>
otherwise equally ranked individuals imposes a heirarchy upon themselves by<br>
selecting managers and agreeing to abide by the decisions of the selected<br>
managers.  I've seen this work well for transient virtual teams of<br>
independant contractors.<br>

<i>&gt;can turn them down the next time they have a project.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The idea isn't to eliminate forces and incentives.  Right now we have</i><br>
<i>&gt;hierarchical structures that opperate within a market environment.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt;say:  "we pay you a yearly salary, so you have to do whatever I say or quit</i><br>
<i>&gt;and find another job".  (Mind you, here in Silicon Valley, competition for</i><br>
<i>&gt;software professionals is so fierce that the answer to this is often "OK, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;quit".)  You could replace the hierarchical structure with a market</i><br>
<i>&gt;structure, where they say "I'll pay you $X for x work, $Y if you do y, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing if you do z, and you get a cut of the profits from A if we finish</i><br>
<i>&gt;it".  What you need are systems that allow us to define x, y, and z clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt;enough that disputes can be resolved.</i><br>
<p>
This model assumes that everyone operates as an independent contractor.  My<br>
favorite aspects of this model is that it would make the work environment<br>
very market driven.  It would allow rapid and accurate adjustments in wages<br>
as the market changed and as job requirements changed.  However, the<br>
current structure of business is too rigid to adapt to such a fluid and<br>
equilibrium sensitive job model.  I do know of (and have worked for) a<br>
couple small companies that actually operate this way.  You don't have to<br>
do anything you don't want to (no work, no pay of course), and the pay for<br>
work is adjusted according to type and market values.  In my experience<br>
this actually seems to produce a more efficient work environment, with few<br>
administrative hassles and a lot more satisfied employees.  It is a lot<br>
more relaxing when you are not "required" to do anything.<br>
