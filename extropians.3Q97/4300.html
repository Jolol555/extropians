the Inventor of the Lorrey Drive wrote<br>
: SF is the only place where I can find new ideas that someone isn't<br>
: trying to bury under umpty million syllables of latin-ish scientificese.<br>
: Why do highly skilled and specialized scientists insist on writing about<br>
: their discoveries in nomenclature and acronyms that only someone also in<br>
: their own highly specialized field would understand?<br>
<p>
Short answer: <br>
"Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction <br>
is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't."  (Mark Twain)<br>
<p>
Long answer:<br>
"The untrained man reads a paper on natural science and thinks: <br>
`Now why couldn't he explain this in simple language.'  He can't<br>
seem to realize that what he tried to read was the simplest<br>
possible language - for that subject matter.  In fact, a great <br>
deal of natural philosophy is simply a process of linguistic<br>
simplification - an effort to invent languages in which half<br>
a page of equations can express an idea which could not be stated<br>
in less than a thousand pages of so-called `simple' language."<br>
(Thon Taddeo in _A Canticle for Leibowitz_ by Walter Miller, 1959)<br>
