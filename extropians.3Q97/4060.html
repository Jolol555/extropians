: Joao Pedro writes:<br>
:  &gt; .... You're talking of voluntary, unselfish actions<br>
:  &gt; from the same species that constantly kills, destroys and robs<br>
:  &gt; other members of the same species? ....<br>
<p>
Constantly?  Speak for yourself.<br>
<p>
quoth Arkuat:<br>
: Language problem here: "voluntary" has nothing to do with<br>
: "unselfish".  Voluntary means uncoerced.<br>
<p>
I think JP means that the set of unselfish acts<br>
and the set of voluntary acts do not intersect<br>
(as much as they need to, to support civilization).<br>
<p>
<p>
JP again:<br>
: &gt; I'll be honest, I don't know what negative feedback is<br>
: &gt; and I know nothing of basic economics [...]<br>
<p>
Damien Sullivan:<br>
: Oy veh!  You expect us to write an introductory economics textbook for<br>
: you?  Perhaps we should teach you what the periodic table is as well?<br>
<p>
Be fair, `negative feedback' is a term of art that probably<br>
isn't in an English-Portuguese dictionary.  I understood<br>
the principle long before I knew what the phrase means.<br>
<p>
<p>
JP again:<br>
:  &gt; I read books, I find it, however, much less boring and<br>
:  &gt; time consuming to ask other persons. Or do you read a book<br>
:  &gt; every time you have a doubt or a question?<br>
<p>
You want a voluntary, unselfish answer?<br>
<p>
<p>
: &gt; People theoretically<br>
: &gt; control government (by voting) and still government is corrupt, why is<br>
: &gt; that? What makes you think that indirect control of economy by persons<br>
: &gt; is going to improve anything?<br>
<p>
There are many answers to this.  Here's one:<br>
You can lie with your vote ("I vote in favor of this subsidy<br>
to show that I am generous ... with other people's money;<br>
I vote for this job-destroying bill to show that I care about<br>
the environment ... provided that other people will suffer<br>
most of the costs; I vote for gun control because I want to<br>
stop the violence ... provided that I can still have armed<br>
guards") but you can't lie with your money.<br>
