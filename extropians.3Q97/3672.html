<i>&gt;         &gt;difference. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You're in a different position than you were 5 minutes ago, does that make </i><br>
<i>&gt; you a different person?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, you are a different person after 5 minutes, even if you haven't<br>
moved.(which is relative, of course)<br>
<p>
What I am trying to say is that if two objects, whatever they are, exist<br>
simultaneously in different locations, they are not the same object (you<br>
want want to use relativity to refute this statement, then I'll *really*<br>
have to think ;)<br>
<p>
It's not that the copy has moved, it's that the original has *not* moved.<br>
<p>
Say you set up a video camera in your duplication chamber.  You now tape<br>
the duplication.  As long as the original is not totally disassembled, it<br>
is pretty easy to tell which is which.  And, if you monitor how they<br>
diverge, you will be able to differentiate them in the future. (or you<br>
could just mark the copy)              <br>
<p>
I agree that we are our thoughts, but the duplicate has had no thoughts,<br>
only *memories* of thoughts.  On the other hand, the original will<br>
theoretically still have some of the atoms that participated in the<br>
chemical reactions that made those thoughts in the first place.  I'm not<br>
convinced that you can hold the copy responsible for the thoughts and<br>
actions of the original.  But that is a more difficult question to answer. <br>

<i>&gt;       &gt;For  example...  say in a galaxy far, far away there is a planet that      </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;developed life exactly like ours.  On this planet, by pure coincidence,      </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;there just happens to be a human being *exactly* like you,      </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;sub-atomic-particle by sub-atomic-particle. Is this person you? I would      </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;say not, even though he has exactly the same structure as you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;              </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; OK, Suppose an exact duplicate of the earth, and it's entire ecosystem, were </i><br>
<i>&gt; made a billion light years away. The duplicate world would need some sort of </i><br>
<i>&gt; feedback mechanism to keep the worlds in synchronization, non linear effects </i><br>
<i>&gt; would amplify tiny variations, even quantum fluctuations, into big </i><br>
<i>&gt; differences, but this is a thought experiment so who cares. In the first two</i><br>
<i>&gt; cases below the results would vary according to personalities, remember </i><br>
<i>&gt; there's a lot of illogic even in the best of us.</i><br>
<i>&gt;              </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) I know all about the duplicate world and you put a 44 magnum to my head </i><br>
<i>&gt;    and tell me in ten seconds you will blow my brains out, am I concerned ? </i><br>
<i>&gt;    You bet I am because I know that your double is holding an identical gun </i><br>
<i>&gt;    to the head of my double and making an identical threat.</i><br>
<i>&gt;              </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) I find out that for the first time since the Big Bang the worlds will </i><br>
<i>&gt;    diverge, in 10 seconds you will put a bullet in my head but my double will </i><br>
<i>&gt;    be spared, am I concerned ? Yes, and angry as well, in times of intense </i><br>
<i>&gt;    stress nobody is very logical. My double is no longer exact because I am </i><br>
<i>&gt;    going through a traumatic experience and my double is not. I'd be looking </i><br>
<i>&gt;    at that huge gun and wondering what it will be like when it goes off and </i><br>
<i>&gt;    if death will really be instantaneous. I'd be wondering if my philosophy </i><br>
<i>&gt;    was really as sound as I thought it was and I'd also be wondering why I </i><br>
<i>&gt;    get the bullet and not my double and cursing the unfairness of it all. </i><br>
<i>&gt;    My (semi) double would be thinking "it's a shame about that other fellow </i><br>
<i>&gt;    but I'm glad it's not me".</i><br>
<i>&gt;              </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3) I know nothing about the duplicate world, a gun is at both our heads and </i><br>
<i>&gt;    are both convinced we're going to die. One gun goes off, making a hell of </i><br>
<i>&gt;    a mess, but the other gun, for inexplicable reasons misfires. In this case </i><br>
<i>&gt;    NOBODY died and except for undergoing a terrifying experience I am </i><br>
<i>&gt;    completely unharmed.   </i><br>
<p>
Let me change the thought experiment a bit.  Lets make the ecosystem that<br>
is the same as ours *similar* to ours.  Similar, but not the same.  Also,<br>
your duplicate has not had the same history as you.  But, by some<br>
*outrageous* and completely *bizarre* coincidence, right at this very<br>
moment your duplicate(which was really a misnomer before) has *exactly*<br>
the same structure as you, and is having the same thoughts and emotions <br>
How this convergence happened when you two people have different<br>
histories completely blows your mind, but this is my thought experiment,<br>
so it happened.  Now my question is the same: Are you the same person?<br>
<p>
My answer would be no, I'd be interested to hear your answer, and why.<br>
<p>
              <br>
<i>&gt; The bottom line is that I don't think we have thoughts and emotions, I think </i><br>
<i>&gt; we are thoughts and emotions, and the idea that the particular hardware that </i><br>
<i>&gt; is rendering them changes their meaning is as crazy as my computer making the </i><br>
<i>&gt; meaning of your post different from what it was on yours.</i><br>
<p>
If I somehow(another thought experiment) have the exact same thought as<br>
you(I'm not sure how you'd go about measuring that) at exactly the same<br>
time, are our two persons converging.  And if this continues, to the point<br>
where ALL our thoughts and emotions are exactly the same, have we become<br>
one person?  Did I die?  Did you die? How can two people become one when<br>
both of them still exist?<br>
<p>
I would say we are still two different peope.  To differentiate, I would<br>
again have to look at history of action(under which I consider thought<br>
to be a subset) and location.<br>
