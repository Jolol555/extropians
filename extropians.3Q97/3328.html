For some this could be looked at as an opportunity rather than a<br>
problem.  I've recently read about MANY older programmers who had<br>
retired because no one wanted their old mainframe skills any more. <br>
Now they're in hot demand.  I think people like Paul Strassman (former<br>
Pentagon information chief) are disasterbating about how much it will<br>
cost to fix - one person's cost is another's income.<br>
<p>
The problems in commercial software applications and organization's<br>
customized information processing systems should be relatively easy to<br>
fix.  The more serious problems may be in existing HARDWARE, such as<br>
old routers, that have these date problems hardcoded into them.  Here<br>
the only solution may be to replace the equipment.  But, again, one<br>
person's need is another person's opportunity.<br>
