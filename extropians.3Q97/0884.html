Actually, if you look at what I wrote (included below) I didn't draw<br>
any conclusions. I'm not sufficiently well versed in anthropology and<br>
history (and lack the time) to do a fair comparision (although I<br>
think it would be worthwhile).<br>
<p>
It seems that you misunderstood my comment about the Greeks and<br>
Romans; while there certainly were some use of psychotropic drugs<br>
(like the molded rye bread suggested by Bobby Whalen) as far as I<br>
know they where never widely used or accepted during the classic era<br>
(the use seem to have spread during the hellenic era); wine (and<br>
opium) seems to have been the intoxicants of choice. From what I know<br>
of the Roman empire the same held there. The comparision was more<br>
Greco-Roman = little psychedelics, Indians = more psychedelics. <br>
<p>
The big question is how to accurately measure novelty. Maybe one<br>
should look at the number of occasions thinkers came up with ideas<br>
people in general (and not just the rulers) disagreed with? <br>

<i>&gt;      comparing Greece and Rome (fairly non-psychotropic as far as I know)</i><br>
<i>&gt;      with India (some use, at least) and the indian civilizations?</i><br>
<i>&gt;      According to McKenna the amount of novelty among the Atztecs would</i><br>
