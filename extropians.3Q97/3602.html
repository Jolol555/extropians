<p>
Aging is not an evolutionary disadvantage, so there is no selection<br>
against it. In nature few individuals even reach adult age, so from<br>
the persepctive of their genes it is more important to give them<br>
the chance to reproduce than to give them a long life. This is why<br>
it is possible to breed long-lived fruit flies by preventing  them<br>
from mating until a certain age, now aging is a disadvantage and<br>
evolution strives to limit it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The genome is finite but there are theories that claim all genes as</i><br>
<i>&gt; pleiotropic or having more than one function at the same time. We are</i><br>
<i>&gt; incredibly complex organisms with enormous interactions between all our</i><br>
<i>&gt; genes. I think that seeing the aging process as individual genetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; errors is a mistake. </i><br>
<p>
I agree completely. The error-catastrophe theory is dead (at least<br>
right now :-), since it cannot explain how single-celled organisms<br>
or germ-line cells survive. The pleiotropic theory of aging is<br>
better, it suggests that some useful genes also have harmful effects<br>
as we grow older, and this seems to be borne out with the calorie<br>
restriction experiments which show that metabolism and aging are<br>
closely tied together. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, there are certainly lethal genes that are active when you are,</i><br>
<i>&gt; say, 200 years old and you will have to deal with them too with the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference being the fact than no-one even knows they exist. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, but as soon as we have solved that genetic problem (which may<br>
be hard), then the solution can be applied to all people. This is just<br>
a limit on how fast lifespan can be increased (and something to<br>
worry about for us first-generation transhumans). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Going back to cryopreservation, this futuristic lethal genes are a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason to pursue successful cryopreservation. That way the first ones to</i><br>
<i>&gt; witness the effects of this lethal genes would be cryopreservated until</i><br>
<i>&gt; a cure was to be found.</i><br>
<p>
Good idea. <br>
<p>
I think our main difference lies in optimism: you see a lot of<br>
problems, I see a lot of hard problems that can be solved, at least<br>
in principle. <br>
