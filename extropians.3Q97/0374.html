I actually think independent contractors are the business model of the<br>
future.  In Silicon Valley, contractors are increasingly becoming the norm.<br>
 A lot of companies employee a significant part of their staff as<br>
contractors.  The benefits are numerous.  For the company, it is usually<br>
cheaper to hire technical contractors only for as long as needed than to<br>
hire them as a full-time employee.  Additionally, it allows the company to<br>
adapt its staff more quickly to the changing business environment without<br>
the hassle of hiring and firing.  For the contractor, there is usually<br>
significantly more money, more freedom, some lifestyle benefits, and the<br>
satisfaction of working for yourself.<br>
<p>
A business form that has started to appear occasionally is groups of<br>
loosely associated independent contractors forming somewhat transient<br>
virtual companies, only staying together for as long as necessary and then<br>
going their own ways.<br>
<p>
I strongly approve of this form of economics because it promotes individual<br>
freedom, reduces corporate bureaucracy, and it more closely ties an<br>
individual's income with his abilities, usefulness, and performance.  The<br>
only downside is that the government makes it more difficult and expensive<br>
to operate this way.  The government prefers that everyone be a faceless<br>
corporate cubicle clone.<br>
