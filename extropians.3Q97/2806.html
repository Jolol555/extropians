I don't think it's time for a consensus yet, especially since we still all<br>
disagree, but my own points-in-progress are utterly different from the four<br>
mentioned by Nicholas Bostrum.<br>
<p>
I offer these assertions:<br>
<p>
1.  Given an island vs. sea battle, the sea will win, whether the "island" is<br>
a malevolent spore or a city.<br>
<p>
2.  As the world stands, nanotechnology cannot be freely distributed.<br>
<p>
3.  Unintentional gray goo is not a serious problem.<br>
<p>
==1==<br>
Given an island vs. sea battle, decisive strategic and tactical advantages lie<br>
with the sea.<br>
<p>
  1a:  This holds true whether the "island" is a spore battling a 'mune<br>
system, or a city battling attack goo.  The island will not gain any ground<br>
against the sea, and will probably be eliminated.<br>
<p>
  1b:  Personal immune systems are feasible as a defense against death goo.<br>
<p>
  1c:  Immune systems are NOT effective against large-scale outbreaks.  That<br>
requires large-scale defense nano armed with nuclear weapons.<br>
<p>
  1d:  Attack goo cannot be allowed to gain a sizable foothold; therefore<br>
there must not be any sizable global area unprotected by an immune system.  If<br>
nanotech can survive in the Earth's core, there must be an immune system there.<br>
<p>
  1e:  Except for a few nano-free fallback asteroids, all massive objects in<br>
the Solar System should be seeded with 'munes as soon as nano is space-capable.<br>
<p>
  1f:  Space is much safer, because one is not automatically surrounded by<br>
huge masses, as one is on a planet.<br>
<p>
<p>
==2==<br>
Five or more governments possessing nanotechnology are dynamically unstable.<br>
<p>
  2a:  Certain governments, such as the Chinese government, are both<br>
repressive and aggressive.  They would wreak havoc given nanotech and launch<br>
nuclear attacks if excluded.<br>
<p>
  2b:  Nanotechnology cannot be freely distributed until every person has a<br>
'mune system and a space evacuation capsule.<br>
<p>
==3==<br>
Unintentional gray goo is a relatively mild danger by contrast.<br>
<p>
  3a:  Strategy and tactics on the molecular level are complex problems<br>
requiring intelligent solutions.  Designed attack goo will annihilate<br>
unresisting reproducers; defense goo will be unassailable.<br>
<p>
  3b:  Evolving gray goo is slightly more dangerous, but not much more, unless<br>
it makes a breakthrough that lets it cut through all defenses before they can<br>
be redesigned.<br>
<p>
  3c:  Gray goo, evolving or otherwise, cannot threaten a prepared opponent. <br>
Space travel is not even necessary.<br>
<p>
  3d:  After having prepared for malevolent goo, mere gray goo does not merit consideration.<br>
<p>
====Recommendations====<br>
<p>
1.  Research into nanotechnology should continue.<br>
<p>
2.  The first group to gain nanotechnology should immediately disable almost<br>
all nuclear weapons, leaving only enough to obliterate goo outbreaks.<br>
<p>
3.  Before announcing nanotechnology, the first group should develop<br>
evacuation capsules and crude 'mune.  If necessary, they should contact Bill<br>
Gates or the U.S. government.<br>
