In a message dated 97-08-24 18:20:24 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; f everybody can (and does) own guns, policing becomes dangerous as hell,<br>
 cops want bigger guns and more of them, and they will use them more often.<br>
 In Holland NOBODY get's to own a gun unless there are special circumstances.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
(yeah, yeah...does holland have an imigration problem or an emigration<br>
problem?...that is ...are people trying to get in ..or get out...or neither?<br>
 We have LOTS of people trying to get in...and very few wanting to leave.<br>
 And if they do want to leave...no one's stopping them...partially because of<br>
the results of:...)<br>
<p>
To quote a couple of our founding fathers....<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Patrick Henry warned, "The militia, sir, is our ultimate safety. ... The <br>
great object is that every man be armed ... everyone who is able may <br>
have a gun." Richard Henry Lee said, "To preserve liberty, it is <br>
essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be <br>
taught alike, especially when young, how to use them."<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
------------------------------------<br>
I submit that in regards to these matters nothing has changed...to suggest<br>
that gun ownership somehow contributes to violence or crime (it does not...in<br>
fact the opposite is true)  is merely to obscure the real objective ...that<br>
is ...to disarm the populance...or as has been said:<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
"A well-regulated population being necessary to the security of a police<br>
state, the right of the Government to keep and destroy arms shall<br>
not be infringed."<br>
<p>

I seem to recall that the US fought wars in the name of perserving our<br>
freedom...hell I was in one...my father was in one..his father was in<br>
one...etc..etc..etc...back to the day when some of my ancestors watched<br>
others of my ancestors sail up to the shore...get off the boat ...and start<br>
making asses of themselves.....<br>
<p>
Doesn't seem right to let it all go down the tubes.<br>
