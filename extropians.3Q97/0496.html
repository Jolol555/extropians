<p>
What I meant, and this may not have been entirely clear, was whether<br>
list members thought another fly-by of the Mars-face area was a good<br>
idea; and this barring any of the preconceived, Hoagland-based<br>
pseudo-science that might be floating around. I tend to think that<br>
another fly-by would either prove them right or shut them up. If right,<br>
well, a long shot; but if wrong, shut them up and at least preserve some<br>
bandwith. This topic is a Metacrawler goldmine.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   10.0 Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr: The standards.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    9.0 Albert Einstein, Steven Hawking: No experiments, no 10.</i><br>

<i>&gt;    7.0 Carl Sagan: Some political influences, but does his homework</i><br>
<i>&gt;        and maintains his integrity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    6.0 ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;    5.0 Andrew Weil: One can be /too/ open-minded.  A bit too</i><br>
<i>&gt;        theatrical and rhetorical, too.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    4.0 Hal Puthoff, Fleischman &amp; Pons: Might be on to something,</i><br>
<i>&gt;        but tend to announce results before verifying them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    3.0 ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;    2.0 John Gray (Mars/Venus): Interesting ideas, thin on facts.</i><br>
<p>
So John Gray is better than Hoagland? At least Hoagland gave us links to<br>
his ideas. Well, I guess when we get to the bottom of the scale the<br>
differences are negligible, but I must say, if I have to buy it, it<br>
better be more than "thin on facts." Any gender stereotype is worthless<br>
in my book, and stereotyping without facts is more than worthless, it's<br>
the memetic equivalent of entropy. And some guy is making beaucoup<br>
d'argent off of it?<br>
<p>
John Gray is definitely worse than an astrologer. He's predicting the<br>
future of your relationship based upon not the heavens, but some<br>
primordial fact sheet that only he has a copy of. No man is alike, no<br>
woman is alike. And I leave it at that.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    1.0 ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;    0.0 L. Ron Hubbard, Creationists, Astrologers.</i><br>
<p>
I would add racists, misogynists, and relationahip experts to this as<br>
well.<br>
<p>
<p>
For the love of Pete,<br>
