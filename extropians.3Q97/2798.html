<i>&gt;      scientific mind may seek to discredit crop circles as hoaxes by</i><br>
<i>&gt;      pointing out the "proof" that they are man-made. In my mind, that</i><br>

<i>&gt;      metaphysical in nature and thus, likely discreditable under classic</i><br>
<i>&gt;      scientific scrutiny.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      However, I consider that the circles, whether they be hoaxes done by</i><br>
<i>&gt;      clever humans or cryptic messages from an advances off-world race, to</i><br>
<i>&gt;      be a fascinating phenomenon, at least archetypally and sociologically.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Some "hoaxes" are deliberate, confessed after the fact to be so, not</i><br>
<i>&gt;      to discredit but to continue a dialog in earnest.  The human-made</i><br>
<i>&gt;      circles I'm told are often done with the utmost reverence, employing</i><br>
<i>&gt;      sacred geometry, considering time and location thoughtfully and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      planned out for months in advance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      One might say that such an elaborate hoax and expenditure of time is</i><br>
<i>&gt;      all for naught.  But even the effect it has on the different camps of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      thought on the legitmacy of crop circles is a fascinating byproduct</i><br>
<i>&gt;      for it "shakes the tree of knowledge" so to speak.  Whether it</i><br>
<i>&gt;      provokes with fascination or irritates and divides groups of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      discussion, it has its place.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      The real world of qualified scientific phenomenon may well be utterly</i><br>
<i>&gt;      more fascinating than the more fanciful and supernatural notions</i><br>
<i>&gt;      sometimes expressed here but whether one outweighs the other in</i><br>
<i>&gt;      importance is up to the individual to decide.  Science and imagination</i><br>
<i>&gt;      should be free to comingle and dance together to produce possibilities</i><br>
<i>&gt;      to come.  I'll leave it to the moderators as to how to regulate a</i><br>
<i>&gt;      balance that doesn't abruptly dismiss or matter-of-factly discredit.</i><br>

Rick, the book I completed most recently was "Contact" by Carl Sagan.<br>
The book I'm reading now is "the Demon-haunted World", By Cark Sagan.<br>
<p>
Sagan was very active founding member of CSICOP. These are scientific<br>
skeptics. In addtion to the Sysiphyan taks of debunking pseudo-science,<br>
they also publish scolarly research in the area of belief and its<br>
psychology. I strongly urge you to read "the Demon-haunted world.",<br>
which has quite a bit to say about crop circles. You may also wish to<br>
join CSICOP and thereby receive their magazine, "Skeptical Inquirer",<br>
which reports on these issues.<br>
