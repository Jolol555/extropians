As a long-timer, I have to agree with Perry's assessment of the initial and,<br>
to my mind, recurring benefit of this list:  intelligent discourse with<br>
people who share overlapping and rare working hypotheses about how the world<br>
works--and about how to work the world.<br>
<p>
Perry, among others, has often taken on the task of educating newbies about<br>
the basics.  But I've never regarded that as the list's primary purpose.<br>
 Other means of education--like background reading--strike me as much more<br>
efficient.<br>
<p>
Of late, I've as a rule deleted huge chunks of posts.  Very few current<br>
writers, frankly, impress me very much.<br>
