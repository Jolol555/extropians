hi,<br>
<p>
I posted a while ago about how could we prevent asteroids from hitting our<br>
space colonies.  Ive thought of a way...  We could build spacecraft/robots to<br>
scout the solar system for debris.  They could get in front of the asteroids<br>
and slow them down, then transport them to a place for examination(for<br>
lifeforms or whatever, then use them for minerals, asteroids contain rare<br>
minerals, such as Iridium).  We would have to build millions of them at<br>
least, but thats no problem in the age of nanotechnology.<br>
<p>
Something else....<br>
<p>
It seems that after billions of years the asteroids of the belt and the<br>
kuiper/oort clouds have settled into gravitational, mathematical<br>
relationships with each other, such as a symbiotic state.  It would be<br>
interesting to know what that state is.  Its probably still chaotic, but<br>
there must be order in that chaos by now, chaos attractors.  Theres probably<br>
a higher order behind it all.<br>
