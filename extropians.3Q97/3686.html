<i>&gt; Some recent posts seem to make no distinction between compassion and</i><br>
<i>&gt; benevolence. Personally, I have little room for compassion which means</i><br>
<i>&gt; "suffering with". Sometimes I do suffer with others but I don't see that as</i><br>
<i>&gt; really desirable or admirable. When carried very far it becomes unhealthy</i><br>
<i>&gt; and distinctly pathological, as in the martyr complex.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Benevolence, by contrast, has nothing to do with suffering in sympathy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Benevolence involves civility, sensitivity, and generosity. All of these</i><br>
<i>&gt; values are, I believe, compatible with intelligent self-interest. Actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; that puts it too weakly: In most circumstances benevolence is part of what</i><br>
<i>&gt; it takes to act in one's true self-interest. (I say "in most circumstances"</i><br>
<i>&gt; because this virtue may break down in extreme situations of survival.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Benevolence forms parts of a rational, critical approach to values in a way</i><br>
<i>&gt; that compassion does not as far as I can see.</i><br>
<p>
While I certainly agree that there is no honor in "suffering with", I<br>
think the word "compassion" has a useful referent not inconsistent with<br>
its etymology and usage here: "to desire that others not suffer."<br>
That's a simple value judgment, and I think a completely rational one.<br>
Rather than "suffering with", which accomplishes nothing, to desire the<br>
end of others' suffering is a prerequisite of acting to end it.  And<br>
ending others' suffering is a rational act for several reasons: e.g.,<br>
sufferers not productive traders.  Some suffering is precipitated by--<br>
I hesitate to say caused because suffering itself is choice--genuine<br>
misfortune, and learning how to end suffering can teach us how to deal<br>
with those misfortunes.<br>
<p>
That in particular is one of the quite valid criticisms of Rand: that<br>
she willfully evades the reality that success is often as much a product<br>
of blind luck as it is of work.  While a rational man would not suffer<br>
faced with such misfortune, many others do, and desiring to end their<br>
suffering can have valuable consequences.<br>
