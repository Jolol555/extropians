I've never understood what is sinful about sex, drugs and rock'n'roll :-)<br>
Heinlein: "The only sin is hurting other people unnecessarily. Hurting<br>
yourself it not sinful, just stupid"     (could not have said it better<br>
myself)<br>

Thanx for putting me straight on this, I think - I'll check the URL's later.<br>
I'll also inform the director of security ;-), I would love to see the look<br>
on his face when he reads this.<br>
It was stated in another post earlier: a little humiliation can be<br>
educational, both for me and for the DirSec ;-)<br>
  "if it doesn't kill you, you can learn from it" <br>
   (mountaineering principle)<br>
I'll be folowing the "META: Psuedo Science" threasd with extra attention.<br>

<i> &gt;If you think about it, the story falls apart completely. Organ</i><br>
<i> &gt;transplants have rejection problems, which means you can't transplant</i><br>
<i> &gt;an organ from a random donor to a patient. Using random people you</i><br>
<i> &gt;have not tissue-typed will likely lead to rejection, not to mention</i><br>
<i> &gt;the risks of spreading disease. So while there might be unscrupulous</i><br>
<i> &gt;people who might be willing to sell others organs, there would be</i><br>
<i> &gt;few buyers who would want them. </i><br>
<p>
is this not 'merely' a matter of having a large &amp; varied supply, and the<br>
ability for storage? (How long can you store a kidney?)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I have been thinking about the current bans on selling organs. The</i><br>
<i> &gt;idea is that it is unfair of selling life-saving organs and that they</i><br>
<i> &gt;should be donated (and perhaps also to prevent poor from selling their</i><br>
<i> &gt;organs). Does it do more good than harm? While I'm certainly not</i><br>
<i> &gt;as market-happy as many (most?) extropians, this is one area where</i><br>
<i> &gt;I have seriously considered a free market solution. </i><br>
<p>
I'm still having some difficulty with the free market solution to a problem<br>
like this (the ethics of an abundant amount of artificial replacements are<br>
so much easier).<br>
I agree with you for the most part but something is nagging me about all this.<br>
Maybe it just takes some getting use to ;-)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;[Newsflash: Anders is taking a stand in a controversial</i><br>
<i> &gt;question! Flame war expected! Pictures at 11. :-)]</i><br>
<p>
let's try to keep things relaxed and more or less rational and informative ;-)<br>
Thanks Anders, for all the info and for the way you presented your viewpoint.<br>
