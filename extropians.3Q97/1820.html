Hello, all!<br>
<p>
My name is Ka-Ping Yee.  I've had an interest in nanotechnology<br>
and extropianism for a while, but only recently came to visit<br>
California and then attended Extro 3, after which i felt<br>
compelled to join this list for the fascinating conversation<br>
that goes on among Extropians.<br>
<p>
The weekend was an absolute blast.  I offer my thanks to Max<br>
More for organizing the event and to everyone that was there<br>
for contributing to the energy, knowledge, and passion that<br>
filled the air.<br>
<p>
On Saturday night i was given the opportunity to present a<br>
little something that i've been working on: the "CRIT Mediator",<br>
a service that provides bidirectional, fine-grained linking<br>
so that you can annotate pages on the Web.<br>
<p>
As a follow-up to the presentation i would like to let all<br>
interested people know that you can try the service at<br>
<p>
    <a href="http://crit.org/">http://crit.org/</a><br>
<p>
The source code for CRIT, in Perl 5, is also available at<br>
that site.  Although it is not yet well documented, you can<br>
download the program, make a few changes to the configuration,<br>
and run your very own mediator if you wish.  I'm hoping that<br>
distributing the source will let ideas flow and let people<br>
build on the work i've done, helping us reach Singularity by<br>
facilitating the evolution of knowledge.<br>
<p>
Have fun!!<br>
<p>
<p>
Ping<br>
