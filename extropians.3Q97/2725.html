Dear fellow Extropians,<br>
<p>
The was a news item on the web several days ago that indicated that a<br>
German company (I believe it was Mercedes, but don't honestly recall.)<br>
announced that they had developed a prototype fuel cell for automobiles.<br>
They further stated that they believed that it would replace the internal<br>
combustion engine within the next decade. They claim that the fuel cell<br>
uses hydrogen as is source of energy.<br>
Obviously, this is outside my area of expertise. I suspect, however, that<br>
there are those among you with substantially more technological knowledge<br>
than I have who might understand the broad implications of this particular<br>
development. <br>
My concern is with its impact on social, economic and international<br>
relations initiatives.<br>
<p>
Your thoughtful responses would be appreciated.<br>
<p>
