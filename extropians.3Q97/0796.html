<i>&gt; &gt; Body movements can alter one's center of gravity significantly.  Just</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as a high jumper can clear a bar without ever having his center of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; gravity above it, the child on the swing can move his legs in or out,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and bend at the waist, to move his center of gravity just a touch</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; higher on each swing than the height attributable to the energy of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the previous reciprocal swing.  On the downstroke, he repositions his</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; body again to prepare for the maneuver on the other side, which uses</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the energy of his muscles without depleting any of the gravitational</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; potential energy he has gained.  The amount of extra energy put into</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the system from his own muscles is enough to escalate each swing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But what is the energy put into? If true action/reaction holds, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rider moving its center of gravity higher will only reduce the momentum</i><br>
<i>&gt; at that point in the swing, so it will not move any higher. If true</i><br>
<i>&gt; action/reaction holds, as it is popularly understood, the rider should</i><br>
<i>&gt; not be able to gain any momentum on each swing without causing a</i><br>
<i>&gt; reaction....</i><br>
<p>
The energy is "put in" as gravitational potential.  Imagine standing on<br>
the swing.  Through most of the stroke you crouch, but when you reach<br>
the apex of the swing, you stand up.  At that point, you have used to<br>
muscles of your legs to raise your center of gravity above where the<br>
swing put it.  As you crouch again on the downswing, you will arrive a<br>
little bit higher on the other side than you would if you hadn't done<br>
that maneuver, and of course when you get there, you'll stand up again<br>
adding yet more gravitational potential.<br>
