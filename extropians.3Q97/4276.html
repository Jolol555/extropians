<i>&gt; Another idea is voluntary charity, but again no guarantee. If nobody wants to </i><br>
<i>&gt; help the poor then they won't be helped, but I don't see how the IRS could do </i><br>
<i>&gt; any better. If I don't want to voluntarily contribute why would I vote for a </i><br>
<i>&gt; politician who makes me, and why would a politician who want's to stay in </i><br>
<i>&gt; power make enemies of the rich and powerful and friends of the poor and </i><br>
<i>&gt; powerless?</i><br>
<p>
Friedman describes state vs. private charity this way: if the majority<br>
favor feeding the hungry man, the politician will find it in his best<br>
interest to do so--but in this case he is unnecesary.  If the majority<br>
are against the hungry man, some individual among the minority may feed<br>
him anyway, but the politician will not--in this case he is detrimental<br>
because he is still taking taxes from that minority.<br>
<p>
Private charity offers no guarantees, but neither does state charity,<br>
because /reality/ offers no guarantees.  Those who desire to offer such<br>
guarantees to the poor are worse than those who ignore them, because<br>
they bring nothing but false hope and empty promises.<br>
<p>
Even the most "greedy", "selfish" individuals (to use those terms as<br>
the stereotypes used by the left) have reasons for helping the poor:<br>
good P.R., eliminating the attendant nuisances, cheap unskilled labor<br>
(for example, to advertise your religion), speculative investment in<br>
human capital, crime reduction, etc.  If you ask the average poor<br>
person whether ey'd rather have a hot meal from a greedy capitalist<br>
who's only giving it for eir image, or have a compassionate state tell<br>
em how they feel his pain while ey starves, I think option 1 wins.<br>
