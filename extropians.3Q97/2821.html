In response to the comments that my first consensus-feeler elicited, <br>
we can make a second attempt by including the following changes and <br>
clarifications and additions (borrowing ideas and formulations from <br>
here and there):<br>
<p>
1. Provided that technological research continues, it is likely that <br>
ab initio molecular nanotechnology, including general assemblers, <br>
will eventually be developed.<br>
<p>
[slight disambiguation]<br>
<p>
2. Hostile attack goo cannot be allowed to gain a sizable foothold;  <br>
therefore there must not be any sizable global area unprotected by an <br>
immune system.<br>
<p>
[This leaves open the possibility that there may be <br>
independent complementary immune systems, either side-by-side or <br>
overlapping. The main reasons for 2 was apparent in the discussion we <br>
had about destruction by induction, the possibility of buiding huge <br>
quantities of TNT, and the inadeqacy of Anders' immune system <br>
proposal to deal with these problems. 2 does not say anything about <br>
whether  an isolated local immune system could be efficient <br>
against grey goo. <br>
<p>
Given an island vs. sea battle, and a certain minimum technology <br>
level on both sides, the sea will win, whether the "island" is a <br>
malevolent spore or a city. <br>
<p>
(I think that Eliezer share this position and that a "not" has got <br>
lost from his statement:<br>
<i> &gt;1b:  Personal immune systems are feasible as a defense against </i><br>
<i>&gt; death  goo.)]</i><br>
<p>
3. In the absence of a global immune system, if most people could <br>
make their own nanotech machines then all human life on earth would <br>
soon become extinct.<br>
<p>
[We leave open the possibity that subterranean bacteria may hang on, <br>
if only because nobody bothers to try to exterminate them. Also note <br>
that we leave open whether the global immune system would be <br>
unique and monolithic or otherwise. The point is that the vast <br>
majority of the earths surface (and crust?) has to covered by one <br>
immune system or another. ]<br>
<p>
4. In the absence of ethical motives, the benefits would outweigh the<br>
costs for a nanotech power that chose to eliminate the competition or<br>
prevent it from arising, provided it had the ability to do so.<br>
<p>
[Hal agrees with this, but several people said they  don't. In at <br>
least one of the cases, the disagreement crept in outside the claim <br>
that is made in 4. 4 does not say that the first nanotech power <br>
*will* eliminate the competition (altough I happen to believe that <br>
that is rather likely). Only that in the absence of ethical motives <br>
it would be rational for it to do so. But ethical motievs need not be <br>
absent and it's decision making (democratic?) need not be perfectly <br>
rational. Also, I use goals as the principle of individuation,so the <br>
nonopower may have a rich internal structure, and it may encompass <br>
many nations with similar aims, for example. With this clarification, <br>
I don't see how anybody could disagree with it, in the light of the <br>
cost-benefit analysis I posted a few days ago.<br>
<p>
The comparative advantage objection is mistaken, as Hal explained:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In particular, the doctrine of </i><br>
<i>&gt;comparative advantage doesn't seem relevant.  You aren't going to </i><br>
<i>&gt;lose access to the resources represented by the competition; rather, </i><br>
<i>&gt;you are going to subsume those resources and gain greater control </i><br>
<i>&gt;over them.</i><br>
<p>
The lost-information objection I find completely unconvincing.<br>
<p>
Carl Feynman says he disagrees with 4 but hasn't been been posting <br>
much  because of an ear infection. I hope he will get better soon. I <br>
want to hear what he has to say about my cost-benefit analysis.]<br>
<p>
5. Unintentional gray goo is a relatively mild danger compared to <br>
attack goo.<br>
<p>

<p>
Well, I should have said that what I was searching for was a <br>
*consensus sapientum* (a consensus of the wise), where the sapienta<br>
are defined as those who by and large agree with Mr. Bostrom   ;-)  .<br>
