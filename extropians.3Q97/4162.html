I flip coin A.  If it lands heads, I will flip coin B.  If coin B lands heads,<br>
I'll give you $20.<br>
<p>
"You did not receive $20.  What is the probability that coin A landed tails?"<br>
<p>
Two-thirds, I should think.<br>
The situations seem analogous.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now I think the correct answer to all these questions is 1/2. Once you</i><br>
<i>&gt; know you are not a clone, the knowledge that a coin flip outcome may</i><br>
<i>&gt; have caused some unobservable external material to be rearranged should</i><br>
<i>&gt; not change the distribution of that outcome.</i><br>
<p>
If the coin-flip could have cloned you and you are not a clone, that<br>
information alters your assessment of probabilities.  If the coin-flip<br>
resulted in a glass of water boiling, the information that you are not a clone<br>
is irrelevant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This set of answers may seem counter-intuitive because you will observe</i><br>
<i>&gt; the subject say "the probability that the coin will land head up is 1/2"</i><br>
<i>&gt; before he goes to sleep and say "the probability that the coin landed head</i><br>
<i>&gt; up is 2/3" immediately after he wakes up. However the alternative is</i><br>
<i>&gt; equally counter-intuitive. If answer set A is correct, and suppose the</i><br>
<i>&gt; copying process is slightly defective so that the original can tell that</i><br>
<i>&gt; he is not a clone when he wakes up, then you will observe the subject say</i><br>
<i>&gt; "the probability that the coin will land head up is 1/2" before he goes to</i><br>
<i>&gt; sleep and say "the probability that the coin landed head up is 1/3"</i><br>
<i>&gt; immediately after he wakes up.</i><br>
<p>
The original subject will say "the probability that the coin landed head up is<br>
1/3".  The cloned subject, if any, will say "the coin landed head up".  The<br>
changes balance out.<br>
