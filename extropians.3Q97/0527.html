<i>&gt;someone's voluntarily desire for a sex change and has it is performed, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;that person is able to fully enjoy his or her new sex -- performing sex and</i><br>
<i>&gt;having orgasms</i><br>
<p>
I would make a further note on this (forgot about LeVay's book, he's <br>
an interesting guy) regarding medical advancement in sex change <br>
operations.  The primary date of the first sex change may not <br>
accurately reflect the actual advancement of the medical technology, <br>
because these operations are denied to persons who have not obtained <br>
a psychological/medical diagnosis of gender mismatch.  In other <br>
words, an individual must be labeled as 'sick' in order to obtain the <br>
operations to change biological sex.  (Therefore your assumption that <br>
the babies were first operated upon makes sense)  I did put in a few <br>
emails to individuals who would know of any change on the horizon, but <br>
it is presently a bone of contention among those, including myself, who <br>
would like to make temporary or permanent body modifications that would <br>
reflect our evolving identities and lifestyles.  <br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
