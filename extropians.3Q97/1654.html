<i>&gt; I thought this was the most overlooked part of cryonics, who is</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to spend the time/effort/money to bring you back.</i><br>
<p>
	I don't see how anyone can think there is not a good answer<br>
for this question.  How much "time/effort/money", as a percentage of<br>
the world total "time/effort/money", do we spend on scientific history<br>
restoration/preservation?  How many people would spend more<br>
"time/effort/money", if they had it, to do something like bring back a<br>
DNA replica of a dinosaur?  I know if %10 of the total<br>
"time/effort/money" that I will produce during my life could bring<br>
back my grandfather, I'd give up many things in my life so that I had<br>
%10 left for this purpose.<br>
<p>
	If you were immortal and the amount of time/effort/money you<br>
could afford in one year was growing exponentially, and you had<br>
already achieved a wealth greater than say Bill Gates...  Couldn't you<br>
spare a few coins (i.e. say, less than .00001% of your total<br>
"time/effort/money" for one year) to help "bring back" even someone<br>
like Hittler?  (Even if it was only so that he could start work<br>
towards eventually making a full restitution for whatever evil he<br>
might have done during his mortal life, like maybe doing studies on<br>
possible ways to potentially "bring back" holocaust victims...? ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As far as legal breakthrough goes, I agree John.</i><br>
<p>
	I, too, agree.  We should definitely make an effort to do it<br>
ourselves, sooner rather than latter...  But eventually will not all<br>
finite amounts of "time/effort/money", no matter how large, be a very<br>
small insignificant amount of what exponentially growing immortals<br>
will be able to do?  Given that, even the slightest bit of idle<br>
curiosity should be enough motivation to spend the insignificant<br>
amount of "time/effort/money" required to bring us back.  I have many<br>
dead friends and ancestors for which I have much more than an idle<br>
curiosity desire to bring back.  Don't you?<br>
