<p>
Certain frogs are have evolved to survive the freezing process, and do so<br>
on a regular basis.  If I remember correctly,(I'm sure a zoologist can<br>
correct me here) the frogs release a chemical that dehydrates the cell, or<br>
atleast convert the H2O to another form.  This stops massive ice<br>
crystals from forming which lyse the cell.<br>
  Surely we can do something similar for human beings?<br>
As for your second point, cryopreservation does just that: it preserves.<br>
Of course you'll come back with lost and damaged neurons, because you had<br>
them when you were frozen.  I think one who wishes to be cryosuspended<br>
should weigh two risks: the risk of losing neurons to old age and the risk<br>
that current cryopreservation techniques will cause you to lose neurons.<br>
Unfortunately, I'd say chance has a bigger role than logic in this<br>
decision.  Who knows if cryonics works until someone is unfrozen?  And who<br>
knows if you will be brain damaged tomorrow?  But then, survival has<br>
always been a combination of skill and luck.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The bigger amount of damage would come from the time I would be in</i><br>
<i>&gt; cryopreservation. I don't have a clue to how much would that be but</i><br>
<i>&gt; we're talking about 50, 100, 200, 500 years! Even more damage is done to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the cells.</i><br>
<p>
If I were to extrapolate current technological progress, I would say 100<br>
years is a very conservative estimate.  The Prometheus Project's goal is<br>
much less.<br>
	And how do you know how much damage is caused by letting frozen<br>
bodies sit for extended periods of time?  What is your evidence that<br>
this damage occurs at all?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In the future, some guys unfreeze my head, probably put it on a new body</i><br>
<i>&gt; and start </i><br>
<i>&gt; working on putting me back to life. The answer would be nanotechnology</i><br>
<i>&gt; to repair the</i><br>
<i>&gt; damage in my brain cells.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Here's my problem, they won't know how the cells were when I died, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; they will just follow a blueprint of 'standard brains' to repair me. My</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem is that, depending on the extent of the damage, I will no longer</i><br>
<i>&gt; be me! I will be a different person because my brain will be changed. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; (or my other me, since that person will no longer be me) might have some</i><br>
<i>&gt; memories of how I used to be but I will be another person.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What do you think of this?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Personally, I'm 19 years old. So, statistically speaking, I have more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than 50 years to find a cure for aging.</i><br>
<p>
Me too!  I've always wondered what the age distribution is like on this<br>
list.  From what I've gathered, it appears to range from undergrad<br>
students to around 60 years old.  Is that about right?  Danny appears to<br>
be younger as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This reminds me of an interesting problem I once argued about, let's</i><br>
<i>&gt; suppose that scientists find a way to transpose a person to another</i><br>
<i>&gt; distant place, almost instantly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course that one's molecules would have to be disorganized and a mass</i><br>
<i>&gt; of one's molecules would be formed. This mass would then go to the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; place in a few seconds and the molecules would, again, be arranged so</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the body of the person would be a body again, a super computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; would know the exact positions of each atom so that the person who left</i><br>
<i>&gt; location A would be exactly in the same conditions is location B.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you think this is the same person who left or is another?</i><br>
<p>
I would say different matter, different position, same person- at that<br>
point.  But after that point, they diverge and become different people.<br>
But that is only if you define a person by their material composition and<br>
history of actions.  I'm not sure how else you might define a person, any<br>
suggestions?<br>
<p>
Actually, by my definition, the person at location B is NOT the same<br>
person, since s/he does not have the same history of actions, or any<br>
history in fact.  So... no, they are not the same person by my definition<br>
of person.  If your definition of person is simply material composition,<br>
then they are the same person... but I'm not sure this is an adequate<br>
definition.  To illustrate, think of a prize you have won.  Now, do you<br>
think an exact atom-by-atom duplicate of yourself deserves this prize or<br>
you. Remember, there is only one prize and no sharing.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Complicating the situation, I could say that some atoms would not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; exactly in the same position but the health of the person would not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; affected. Now, is this the same person who left location A?</i><br>
<p>
No, again.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; What about if some atoms are replaced but the positions remain the same?</i><br>
<i>&gt; What if some atoms are replaced and some positions changed? What if all</i><br>
<i>&gt; atoms are changed but the positions are the same? Remember that for</i><br>
<i>&gt; everyone else this person is always the same no matter how many atoms</i><br>
<i>&gt; you replace. I'm atheist so I don't believe much in souls but I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; some of this questions are interesting.</i><br>
<p>
No, no, and no.<br>
<p>
I agree, the questions are interesting.<br>
I think the most interesting question of all is: WHAT DEFINES A PERSON?<br>
