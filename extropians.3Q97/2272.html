The subject line is the title of a 1992 (?) book by Merlin Donald,<br>
Department of Psychology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario,<br>
Canada, _ Origins of the Modern Mind: Three Stages in the Evolution of<br>
Culture and Cognition_.  I found Donald’s fascinating precis at<br>

<p>
If this is old stuff, forgive me.  Otherwise, here’s a summary, which<br>
seems relevant to theories of "the augmented animal", memory models<br>
and AI.  All of the following is snipped from the essay at the above<br>

<p>
Abstract: [SNIP] My central hypothesis is that there were three major<br>
cognitive transformations by which the modern human mind emerged over<br>
several million years, starting with a complex of skills presumably<br>
resembling those of the chimpanzee. These transformations left, on the<br>
one hand, three new, uniquely human systems of memory representation,<br>
and on the other, three interwoven layers of human culture, each<br>
supported by its corresponding set of representations. [SNIP] <br>
<p>
The first transition introduced two fundamentally new cognitive<br>
features: a supramodal, motor-modelling capacity called mimesis, which<br>
created representations that had the critical property of voluntary<br>
retrievability. The second transition added two more features: a<br>
capacity for lexical invention, and a high-speed phonological<br>
apparatus, the latter being a specialized mimetic subsystem. The third<br>
transition introduced external memory storage and retrieval, and a new<br>
working memory architecture. [SNIP]<br>
<p>
Apes have episodic memory, that is the ability to store their<br>
perceptions of specific episodes. However, they have very poor<br>
episodic recall, because they cannot self-trigger their memories: that<br>
is, they have great difficulty in gaining voluntarily access to the<br>
contents of their own episodic memories independently of environmental<br>
cues. Thus they are largely environmentally- driven, or conditioned,<br>
in their behavior, and show very little independent thought that is<br>
not directly related to specific episodes. I have called their style<br>
of thought and culture "episodic."  [SNIP] They can learn signs made<br>
available by human trainers, but they do not invent them on their own;<br>
nor do they seem to consciously "model" their patterns of movement, in<br>
the sense of reflecting on them, experimenting with them, and pushing<br>
them to the limits, the way humans do. This seems to indicate that<br>
they are far less developed than humans in at least two areas of motor<br>
control: the construction of conscious action-models, and the<br>
independent voluntary retrieval of such models.  [SNIP] Thus apes are<br>
not good at improving their skills through systematic rehearsal. The<br>
contrast with human children in this regard is striking. [SNIP]<br>
<p>
First transition: mimetic skill and autocueing <br>
<p>
The rationale for the first transition is based on several premises:<br>
(a) the first truly human cognitive breakthrough was a revolution in<br>
motor skill--mimetic skill--which enabled hominids to use the whole<br>
body as a representational device; (b) this mimetic adaptation had two<br>
critical features: it was a multimodal modelling system, and it had a<br>
self-triggered rehearsal loop (that is, it could voluntarily access<br>
and retrieve its own outputs); (c) the sociocultural implications of<br>
mimetic skill are considerable, and could explain the documented<br>
achievements of Homo erectus; (d) in modern humans, mimetic skill in<br>
its broadest definition is dissociable from language-based skills, and<br>
retains its own realm of cultural usefulness; and (e) the mimetic<br>
motor adaptation set the stage for the later evolution of language.<br>
[SNIP]<br>
<p>
Early language theories of evolution are seeking a "quick fix"<br>
solution, a rapid leap to some form of language without attending to<br>
the more fundamental motoric changes that must have preceded it. (In<br>
the process, of course, these theories also sustain the AI agenda that<br>
attributes all higher cognition to some sort of symbolizing process:<br>
see Dennett, 1992). [SNIP]<br>
<p>
Second transition: lexical invention<br>
<p>
The rationale for the second transition is briefly as follows: (a)<br>
since no linguistic environment yet existed, a move towards language<br>
would have depended primarily on developing a capacity for lexical<br>
invention; (b) phonological evolution was accelerated by the emergence<br>
of this general capacity for lexical invention, and included a whole<br>
complex of special neuronal and anatomical modifications for speech;<br>
(c) the language system evolved as an extension of lexical skill, and<br>
gradually extended to the labelling of relationships between words,<br>
and also to the imposition of more and more complex metalinguistic<br>
skills that govern the uses of words; and (d) the natural collective<br>
product of language was narrative thought, (essentially, storytelling)<br>
which evolved for specific social purposes, and serves essentially<br>
similar purposes in modern society. [SNIP]<br>
<p>
Third transition: the externalization of memory <br>
<p>
The case for a third cognitive transition is based on arguments,<br>
partly structural, and partly chronological, that are similar in<br>
principle to those used for the first two; but the physical factors<br>
that supported the third transition are a little different, inasmuch<br>
as the latter was driven primarily by technological, rather than<br>
biological developments. The chronological evidence is based on the<br>
rapid emergence of whole new classes of memory representations --<br>
external memory records -- as well as a major change in the types of<br>
symbolic artifacts produced by humans. The structural argument is<br>
based partly on neuropsychological and neurophysiological evidence<br>
bearing on localization and plasticity, and partly on an analysis of<br>
cognitive architecture in the context of our new relationship with<br>
external memory. [SNIP]<br>
<p>
The structural case can be stated as follows: (a) external memory has<br>
introduced radical new properties into the collective storage and<br>
retrieval systems of humans; (b) the use of these external storage<br>
systems is difficult, and requires a major re-deployment of cerebral<br>
resources towards establishing literacy- related "modules" in the<br>
brain; (c) the physiological basis for this reorganization probably<br>
lies in neuronal epigenesis and plasticity; and (d) the role of<br>
biological working memory has been changed by the heavy use of<br>
external memory. [SNIP]<br>
<p>
The external display projects directly to the visual regions, which<br>
now become the locus of a new kind of internal working memory, one<br>
which utilizes the power of the perceptual systems. In effect, because<br>
the perceptual systems are displaying representations (as opposed to<br>
nonsymbolic objects), the user's brain can move through "information<br>
space" just as it has always moved through the natural environment,<br>
with the difference that processing occurs on two levels, instead of<br>
only one. The items displayed in the external memory field are treated<br>
first as natural objects and events, and second as memory<br>
representations that can externally program the user's brain, that is,<br>
create specific states of knowledge that were intended by the creator<br>
of the particular external device on display. <br>
<p>
[SNIP  to final paragraph]<br>
The modern brain must accommodate not only these new working memory<br>
arrangements, and all the coding demands imposed by symbolic literacy,<br>
but also a number of metalinguistic skills that simply did not exist a<br>
few thousands of years ago. The latter are socially-entrenched; for<br>
instance an enterprise like modern science is very much a collective<br>
endeavor, in which the individual mind is essentially a node in a<br>
larger networked structure supported by external memory. Humans have<br>
been part of a collective knowledge enterprise ever since mimetic<br>
skill permitted us to break with the limitations of episodic<br>
cognition, but external memory has amplified the number and variety of<br>
representations available in human culture, and increased the degree<br>
to which our minds share representations and rely on external devices<br>
for the process of thought itself. Cognitive studies of the modern<br>
workplace testify to the way that electronically distributed knowledge<br>
representation, and computer-coordinated planning and problem-solving,<br>
are affecting the relative roles of individual minds and external<br>
memory devices in this collective enterprise.<br>
