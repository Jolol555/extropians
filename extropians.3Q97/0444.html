Clothes are both "functional" and social.  Clothes are functional in that<br>
they keep us warm and cool, protect us from injury, maintain privacy, help<br>
us carry things, and enhance our figures.  But since they are usually<br>
visible to others, clothes also allow us to identify with various groups,<br>
to demonstrate our independence and creativity, and to signal our wealth,<br>
profession, and social status.  The milder the environment, the more we<br>
expect the social role of clothes to dominate the functional role.<br>
<p>
Beliefs are also both functional and social.  Functionally, beliefs help<br>
us choose our actions, given our preferences.  But many of our beliefs are<br>
also social, in that others see and react to our beliefs.  So beliefs can<br>
also allow us to indentify with groups, to demonstrate our independence<br>
and creativity, and to signal our wealth, profession, and social status.<br>
<p>
For example, a belief that the local sports team will do well can help me<br>
associate with my locality.  A belief that my future looks bright can help<br>
me attract a mate.  A belief that UFOs are aliens could help me signal<br>
that I'm an independent thinker, while a belief that UFOs are bunk could<br>
help me signal my scientific education.  A belief that a Democrat would<br>
make a better president could help me signal my caring and concern about<br>
others.<br>
<p>
For subjects with little social monitoring and strong personal penalties<br>
for incorrect beliefs, we expect the functional role of beliefs to<br>
dominate.  Beliefs about small military missions or small engineering<br>
projects come to mind.  But for subjects with high social interest and<br>
little personal penalty for mistakes, we expect the social role of beliefs<br>
to dominate.  Consider beliefs about large elections or beliefs addressing<br>
abstract philosophical, religious, or scientifc questions.<br>
<p>
If people could wear a parka undetected underneath a bikini, bikinis might<br>
be in fashion in the Arctic, and Arctic folks wouldn't need to trade<br>
off the functional and social roles of clothes.  Similarly, if people<br>
could choose their external behavior independently of their internal<br>
beliefs, then internal beliefs would never need to be anything but our<br>
best computationally-feasible estimate of the way things really are.  But<br>
since it is typically hard to say one think and believe another, the<br>
functional and social roles of beliefs do conflict.<br>
<p>
O.K.  Now that we realize this, what do we do?  I think it is a mistake to<br>
assume that the solution is to educate people about how to better<br>
construct more functional beliefs.  It is not obvious that, given typical<br>
preferences over functional vs. social outcomes, people are biased toward<br>
the social role of beliefs.  Of course more education on either role can<br>
help people get better results without hurting the other role.  But more<br>
education costs more, and it is not obvious that people are biased against<br>
such educational spending.<br>
<p>
The conflict between the functional and social roles of clothes has become<br>
less of a concern with the invention of new materials and designs, and as<br>
we have become rich enough to move to milder climates.  Similarly, I think<br>
a key to reducing the conflict between the functional and social roles of<br>
beliefs is to better understand both roles, espcially the<br>
academically-neglected social role of beliefs.<br>
<p>
Just as it seems that teenage smoking can't be reduced much without giving<br>
teenagers good substitute ways to show their independence and coolness,<br>
the social costs of mistaken beliefs about politics and UFOs probably<br>
can't be reduced much without giving people good substitue ways to show<br>
their concern and independence. But it is hard to create substitutes for<br>
things until you understand in some detail the functions they now perform.<br>
<p>
Also, the conflict between the functional and social role of beliefs can<br>
be muted by the invention of better social institutions, such as<br>
political parties or academic journals, to which people might delegate<br>
their actions.  Within such institutions, social relations may be<br>
structured so that social pressures are better aligned with functional<br>
pressures on beliefs.  But, again, it is hard to design better<br>
institutions with only the fuzziest understanding of these pressures.<br>
<p>
Fortunately, innovation in clothes proceeded even without a deep<br>
understanding of either fabrics or the social and functional roles of<br>
clothes.  Similarly, belief complexes and social institutions have evolved<br>
even without a deep understanding of the nature of computation and of the<br>
social and functional roles of beliefs.  But there is reason to hope that,<br>
as with clothes, such evolution may proceed faster with a deeper<br>
understanding of these issues.<br>
