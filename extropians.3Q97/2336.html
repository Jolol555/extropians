<p>
The center of the Sun is far denser than ordinary lead.  The bomb, at zero<br>
pressure, has about the density of silicon.  It is true that on its way down<br>
it will encounter layers denser than this, but by the time it gets there, it<br>
will be under much more pressure, and will be compressed to be much smaller,<br>
so it will still be denser than the surrounding gas.  In fact, it will<br>
always be at least several times denser than the medium it is faling through.<br>
<p>
This is provided that it is not substantially hotter than its surroundings,<br>
since being hotter makes it expand and reduces its density.  While it's<br>
dropping, it will be heated by compression, but the medium around it is also<br>
heated by compression, so as long as the bomb is cooler at the surface it<br>
will stay cooler all the way down.  So it is important to deliver it to the<br>
surface of the Sun in a way tha leaves it no hotter than the Sun itself.<br>
That means that it has to be placed rather gently on the surface of the Sun,<br>
rather than being dropped in at orbital velocity (200 km/sec).  Forrest<br>
Bishop's message suggested doing this by halting an orbiting bomb in its<br>
orbit using a gravitational slingshot manuver.  Unfortunately, this won't<br>
work because such manuvers are limited in their delta-v to the escape<br>
velocity for the bodies concerned, which for planet-size objects are only<br>
tens of kilometers per second.  I was imagining using mass drivers on the<br>
bomb to bring it suddenly to a halt by catching a bunch of mass going the<br>
other way in the same orbit.  I'm not sure it's feasible; there's a lot of<br>
waste heat.<br>
