I for one am uninterested in "acceptance" to the extent that it means<br>
anything more than the elimination of second-class citizenship in my<br>
society.  Period.  From friends and relevant others, admiration and warm<br>
regard is what I'm after but it is certainly rarely my "gayness" that<br>
earns it.  In identifying myself as a member of this stigmatized group, I<br>
am just *facing facts*, recognizing that I am susceptible to a description<br>
on the basis of which I am likely to be treated irrationally here and now.<br>
Heterosexism is surreally unjust and irrational, and so long as it exists<br>
and is applied to me I will bloody well fight it on its own terms.  As for<br>
the vertiginous thrill that presumably falls upon those lucky individuals<br>
who manage to achieve "victim status," I have to say that I find it to be<br>
somewhat overrated and more than mildly distasteful. <br>
 <br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Fair enough, though I will say that the arguments I find myself making to<br>
defend or explain my atheism, vegetarianism, or technological immortalism<br>
to incomprehending others often resonate conspicuously with those I make<br>
about queerness.  As I said, I think queerness and extropianism comport<br>
well together.  Perhaps this is what Natasha is zeroing in on when she<br>
sees in gay pride a symbol for triumphant individualism.  No doubt she<br>
sees things in it she likes less well as well (sheesh -- so do I), but<br>
it's the repudiation of conventions, the ethical embrace of pleasure, and<br>
the celebration of experimentalism that she wants to italicize about the<br>
movement.   <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Why one should seize on a matter of taste as the essence of one's</i><br>
<i>&gt; identity, I may never understand </i><br>
<p>
I'll go you one better:  Why one should wish to be exhaustively or even<br>
adequately describable under *any* glib bumper sticker of an identity-tag<br>
is something I scarcely understand.  Were I to stumble upon any attribute<br>
whatsoever that rated the description "essence of my identity" I imagine I<br>
would be, frankly, flabbergasted.  Like calling Whitman (you know, "I<br>
contain multitudes"?) "just a fag".  Best, Dale<br>
