&gt; Dear Friend -
&gt; 
&gt; Below is a well written account of what the CODEX Alimentarius
&gt; Commission
&gt; will mean to every American, Canadian and European. Please read and
&gt; stop
&gt; 
&gt; Bill S.830. Write to your Congressman, Senator and local newspapers,
&gt; and
&gt; 
&gt; tell all your friends.

&gt;            Codex Alimentarius - A Plan To Ban All Supplements
&gt;                                    By Jackie Buchanan
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;    "Unless we put medical freedom into the constitution, the time
&gt;    will come when medicine will organize itself into an undercover
&gt;    dictatorship...denying equal privileges. All such laws are un-
&gt;    American and despotic...
&gt; 
&gt;                           -Benjamin Rush, Physician
&gt;                            Signer, Declaration of Independence
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   Codex Alimentarius, in simple terms, is a  code of law for food.
&gt; What it actually means to each and everyone of us is a threat to our
&gt; health and the health of every human being on this planet.
&gt; 
&gt;   The future availability and legal status of herbs, vitamins,
&gt; amino acids, minerals and all other supplements in the U.S. and
&gt; throughout the world, may be determined by a committee made up of 146
&gt; nations called the Codex Alimentarius Commission, which operates in
&gt; conjunction with the United Nations and the World Health Organization
&gt; (WHO).
&gt; 
&gt;   It is under the guise of protecting public safety through the
&gt; standardization of food and botanical codes that the commission
&gt; may be a tool of the international pharmaceutical industry that
&gt; is intent on making ALL SUPPLEMENTS -herbal or otherwise-
&gt; available by prescription only.
&gt; 
&gt;   Established in 1962 for the purpose of setting international
&gt; standards and codes for foods, the Codex Commission is over-
&gt; whelmingly composed of German and International Pharmaceutical
&gt; Corporations. Over 90% of the international organizations ALLOWED to
&gt; send delegates to the meetings represent giant multinational
&gt; pharmaceutical corporations. The only consumer organization is the
&gt; International Organization of Consumer Unions. NEITHER THE NATURAL
&gt; HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY NOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC HAS ANY
&gt; REPRESENTATION AT THE CODEX MEETINGS.
&gt; 
&gt;   Spearheaded by the German pharmaceutical corporations, this
&gt; Codex Commission plans to ban -on a worldwide basis- any health
&gt; statement in relation to any non-prescription supplement,
&gt; preventive, therapeutic, or otherwise. Moreover, any formulas
&gt; which would still be available would have to meet the arbitrary
&gt; restrictions of the Codex Commission. Those nations that do not comply
&gt; with these restrictions are faced with economic sanctions.
&gt; 
&gt;   While researching this article, I came across a letter written
&gt; in 1995 from Matthias Rath,MD to Chancellor Kohl and Members of
&gt; the German Bundersag, prior to the Codex meeting in Bonn Germany
&gt; in 1996.
&gt; 
&gt;      "As a physician and scientist who led the breakthrough in
&gt;      vitamin research which can eradicate heart disease, I feel
&gt;      it is incumbent upon me to address this important matter...
&gt;      as I see it, the attack of the Codex Commission is a
&gt;      desperate act by the pharmaceutical companies to protect
&gt;      their world wide drug market against naturally effective
&gt;      and much more affordable supplements. Particularly disturbing is
&gt;      the role of the German pharmaceutical and chemical corporations
&gt;      within the Codex Commission. Once before in this century, a
&gt;      German pharmaceutical and chemical corporation, I.G. Farben,
&gt;      became responsible for the deaths of millions of people and
&gt;      consequently was dismantled in 1946 by the Nurenberg Tribunal and
&gt;      split into Bayer, BASF, and Hoechst. With the current plans of
&gt;      the German pharmaceutical companies, the predictable dimension of
&gt;      the unnecessary and premature death of millions of people is
&gt;      unavoidable. If the Codex Commission is allowed to obstruct the
&gt;      eradication of heart disease by restricting access to nutritional
&gt;      supplements, more than 12 million people world-wide will continue
&gt;      to die every year from premature heart attacks and strokes.
&gt;      Within the next generation alone, this would result in over 300
&gt;      million premature deaths, more than in all the wars of mankind
&gt;      together..."
&gt; 
&gt; When I first read this, I took it with a grain of salt - until I
&gt; came across an article in Issue 14 of the  Alternative Medicine
&gt; Digest, a reprint of  an article that originally appeared in the
&gt; Wall Street Journal on April 25, 1996. The headline read "They're
&gt; Scientific When It Suits Them, But a $1.4-Billion Deal is Better than
&gt; Science." The article opened by saying that if a study which was
&gt; peer-reviewed by 5 independent medical experts had been published in
&gt; the Journal of the American Medical Association in January 1995 as
&gt; planned, American consumers with thyroid problems would have saved
&gt; $356 million a year in drug costs.
&gt; 
&gt;      However, the publication of this article would have wrecked
&gt;      a $1.4-billion deal for its manufacturer, Boots Company, the
&gt;      British pharmaceuticals and drugstore chain. The study documented
&gt;      how Synthroid, which controls 84% of the US thyroid medication
&gt;      market and is used by 8 million Americans, works no better than 3
&gt;      other lower priced drugs.
&gt; 
&gt;      The makers of Synthroid - first introduced in 1958 as a
&gt;      synthetic version of thyroid hormone - had never been
&gt;      required by the FDA to submit proper clinical trial data,
&gt;      like other drugs. An unpatented drug for underactive
&gt;      thyroids,Synthroid's vigorous U.S. sales have been protected
&gt;      by something as good as a patent: the presumption that the
&gt;      competing, lower-priced drugs are not bioequivalent, which means
&gt;      that they are not absorbed and assimilated as fast and as well as
&gt;      Synthroid.
&gt; 
&gt;      The JAMA study proved this presumption wrong and it was about to
&gt;      call an end to Synthroid's free market run. Even worse, the study
&gt;      would have jeopardized Boots' $1.4 billion buy-out by Germany's
&gt;      BASF-AG. How did the study's sponsor, which has invested $250,000
&gt;      to finance the research feel about it? It was the sponsor itself
&gt;      -- none other than Boots   that did everything to discredit the
&gt;      study and block its publication. Quite clearly, scientific
&gt;      evidence takes a backseat to preserving the competitive edge.
&gt; 
&gt;    Another more recent web-site written from a Canadian point of
&gt; view about how Codex will affect Canada goes on to state:
&gt; 
&gt;      In October, 1996, Codex met in Bonn, Germany to make radical
&gt;      changes in the rules governing dietary supplements for member
&gt;      nations. The proposals of greatest concern were those
&gt;      made by the German delegation (see the proposed Draft Guidelines
&gt;      for Dietary Supplements) and is being sponsored by Hoechst, Bayer
&gt;      and BASF. These are the three drug companies formed when the
&gt;      Nurenberg War Trials disbanded IG Farben, manufacturer of
&gt;      the poison gas used in Nazi concentration camps. This is not the
&gt;      first time that the UN has been linked closely with Nazi war
&gt;      criminals. Ostensibly, their purpose is "...to create a
&gt;      set of international standards to guide the world's growing food
&gt;      industry and to protect the health of consumers.
&gt; 
&gt; Can reports from 4 different, totally unrelated sources, be
&gt; ignored? I think not!
&gt; 
&gt; The pharmaceutical company backed proposals call for the following:
&gt; 
&gt;   1. No vitamin, mineral, herb, etc., can be sold for
&gt;       prophylactic (preventative) or therapeutic reasons.
&gt; 
&gt;   2. Natural remedies can be sold as food but they must not exceed
&gt;       the potency (dosage) levels set by the commission. This means
&gt;       that consumer access to dietary supplements will be limited to
&gt;       the RDA dosage as a maximum limit for vitamins (Vitamin C - 60
&gt;       mg. Vitamin E - 15 mg., etc.) Supplements without an RDA (e.g.
&gt;       coenzyme Q10) would be illegal to sell because they would all
&gt;       become drugs.
&gt; 
&gt;   3. Codex regulations for dietary supplements would become
&gt;       binding, eliminating the escape clause within the General
&gt;       Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that allows a nation
&gt;       to set its own standards. This applies to all member
&gt;       countries of the UN. Any nation that does not accept these
&gt;       new standards will be heavily fined by the World Trade
&gt;       Organization (WTO) creating the potential for crippling
&gt;       entire sectors of that nation's economy.
&gt; 
&gt;   4. All new supplements would be banned unless they go through
&gt;       the Codex approval process. Five steps have already been
&gt;       taken in the Codex process over the past few years. Remember
&gt;       Canadian Bill C-7 which was passed eventually in Canada as C-8?
&gt;       The similarity of the process, the secrecy, and the wording
&gt;       between the Codex proposals and the Canadian laws is uncanny.
&gt;       Voting in favor of adopting the German proposals has been
&gt;       overwhelming (16 for 2 against in the most recent vote). The
&gt;       Codex process is now at Step Five - formalization and debate
&gt;       concerning the specific features. In two years, Codex could jump
&gt;       from Step 5 to Step 8 to finalize these restrictions.
&gt; 
&gt;   In the U.S., the FDA has already tried to use guerrilla tactics to
&gt; stop the use of these supplements. The first time I became totally
&gt; aware of their horrendous practices was in the case of ESSIAC, the
&gt; herbal formula that had been researched since the 1920's with
&gt; excellent results in curing, yes I said curing, cancer. Fortunately,
&gt; once their tactics came to light, a nation-wide non-violent revolution
&gt; took place resulting in millions who were appalled at the tactics,
&gt; writing letters and calling their congressmen and the FDA. The end
&gt; result, ESSIAC is now widely available in many forms. Even Respirin,
&gt; the drug company in Canada who owned the rights to the formula has
&gt; started producing it and selling it via magazine ads and in health
&gt; food stores. All of this took place in 1989-1990.
&gt; 
&gt;    In 1992, the FDA raided the Tahoma Clinic in Kent, Washington. The
&gt; FDA alleged that Dr. Wright, MD was engaged in the commerce of foreign
&gt; labeled injectable "drugs" (which were actually vitamins). This action
&gt; interfaced with FDA raids of 17 health food stores in Texas and others
&gt; in Oklahoma, supplement manufacturing facilities in California,
&gt; Oregon, and Washington, and other nutritionally-oriented medical
&gt; doctors across the US. Again, there was a national call to action of
&gt; everyone interested in preserving their rights to make their own
&gt; choices in health care. Letters were mailed and faxed to the White
&gt; House by the millions and once again, the FDA was forced to back off.
&gt; At this same time Bill H.R. 3642/S2135 was in committee and being
&gt; reviewed prior to voting it into  law. This bill would have given the
&gt; FDA the power to put the health food and dietary supplement industry
&gt; out of business. It would have also given them the power to legally
&gt; conduct warrantless searches, seize and embargo products and levy
&gt; heavy fines ($250,000 on individuals and $1,000,000 on companies)
&gt; without a trial. Again, the people of the United States took action
&gt; and through a powerful campaign whereby they voiced their opinions,
&gt; another small battle was won for freedom of choice!
&gt; 
&gt;   In 1995, the FDA attempted to quietly but quickly do away with
&gt; the use of any type of electronic instrumentation (not already
&gt; approved) for use in diagnosing, tracking, or treating illness.
&gt; This would have affected many doctors, dentists, osteopathic
&gt; physicians, chiropractors, etc. Fortunately, they banded together, got
&gt; their scientific studies and documentation together and, after a long
&gt; hard struggle, managed to hold their ground and prevent the FDA and
&gt; other interested parties (pharmaceutical companies and medical
&gt; practitioners who felt that only the usual methods of treatment, ie.
&gt; surgery and drugs should be allowed) from getting their way.
&gt; 
&gt;   Now, here we are in 1997 and BY ALL APPEARANCES, the FDA has
&gt; ceased their efforts to take away our rights to make our own
&gt; choices about healthcare. Their policy with regard to the Codex
&gt; standards is stated in the Federal Register of October 11, 1995
&gt; - FDA Policy on Standards, which states:
&gt; 
&gt;   "It is the intent of this policy to enable the FDA to continue
&gt; to participate in international standards activities that assist
&gt; it in implementing statutory provisions...
&gt; 
&gt; and
&gt; 
&gt;   "The development of an international standard that achieves the
&gt; agency's public objectives is generally, but not always, given a
&gt; higher priority than the development of a domestic standard...
&gt; 
&gt; and
&gt; 
&gt;   "Where a relevant international standard exists, or completion
&gt; is imminent, it will generally be used in preference to a domestic
&gt; standard...
&gt; 
&gt; In considering the above statements about their intentions coupled
&gt; with their past tactics as well as their continuing policy of ignoring
&gt; the public's wishes in protecting health freedom, a public outcry
&gt; against the Codex is again called for. I urge you to educate
&gt; yourselves to what is really going on here. Most of the information
&gt; can be found on the Web. In the past 4 months, I have found only one
&gt; small article about this issue, tucked away in the back pages of Issue
&gt; 18 of the Alternative Medicine Digest which is on the newsstands now.
&gt; 
&gt;   If the German and Canadian proposals are passed, it would
&gt; constitute an effective end run by the pharmaceutical companies
&gt; around the medical rights of Americans. They wouldn't dare attempt to
&gt; do this in the U.S. because there would be such a public uproar it
&gt; would never pass through congress. However, by taking the stance that
&gt; they have, the FDA WILL ACCOMPLISH ITS GOALS BY LETTING CODEX
&gt; DO ITS UNACCEPTABLE DIRTY WORK. The pharmaceutical companies
&gt; are planning a global takeover of the vitamin-herb industry and
&gt; within a few short years, they will have succeeded by pushing
&gt; competitors out of the field. They are planning to do it very quietly
&gt; and carefully through GATT and the Codex Commission. They will
&gt; succeed if they are not exposed and their plan is not given national
&gt; headlines.
&gt; 
&gt;   This is the last wake-up call that may be given before it is
&gt; too late. It is of the utmost importance that everyone become
&gt; aware and voice their displeasure with the leaders of their
&gt; respective governmental agencies. In the U.S., it is imperative
&gt; that everyone call and write to their local congressmen. Phone
&gt; the White House. Call the FDA. Tell everyone you know to do the
&gt; same. Call your local newspaper and alert them to what is really
&gt; going on here. If we don't take action now, our freedom to choose
&gt; will be taken away without most of us even being aware that it
&gt; had happened!
