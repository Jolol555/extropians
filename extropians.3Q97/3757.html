This is highly irrational, even for you. If you call drugs evil you should<br>
also call the sun evil (causes skincancer right?). The effects of illegal<br>
drugs may be undesirable, the effect of a .308 bullet can also be. Doesn't<br>
make the bullet 'evil'. The way drugs are treated by the state causes<br>
'emerging' effects that are bad for people. don't blame the thing, blame<br>
the people making the policy.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;It's not my way in any case - if I go after drugs it will</i><br>

<p>
I hope you will also take responsenbility incase of a mutation causing,<br>
say, 11 million deaths? How will you control them from killing of humans,<br>
livestock or crucial agricultural spiecies?<br>
<p>
Of course the whole plan is highly theoretical but I'll go along.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Have you ever read O'Rourke's</i><br>

<i> &gt;Hell. In fact, as an SF reader, I have to say that there are quite a</i><br>
<i> &gt;few Hells - and not lighthearted ones either - where I would rather be,</i><br>

<i> &gt;Pournelle's "Inferno" comes to mind, or the concentration camps of the</i><br>
<i> &gt;Holocaust.</i><br>
<p>
???????? Wow... *this* from *you*<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;I am a human first and a Libertarian second.  Would you, as a</i><br>
<i> &gt;Libertarian, have kept the U.S. out of World War II, knowing that if you</i><br>
<i> &gt;did so the Holocaust would continue and Hitler would rule the world? </i><br>
<i> &gt;Why should your principles as a Libertarian stop at the U.S. border? </i><br>
<i> &gt;Don't the people ruled by dictators have rights too? Shouldn't they,</i><br>
<i> &gt;too, be protected against their government?  Don't the Libertarian</i><br>
<i> &gt;principles - or any principles, taken to their logical extreme - demand</i><br>
<i> &gt;that one attempt to conquer the world?</i><br>
<p>
In a very differnt way you seem to come to the same conclusion as I did<br>
that any and all human-rights violations should be ended (by force if<br>
neccecary) by a sort of world governement. Altough I would never use the<br>
term conquer the world. Just remove the dictator and then organize<br>
elections A.S.A.P and get out.<br>
And I'd like their to be *lots* of controls on the UN. <br>
<p>
<i> &gt;So my ethical system (and, I admit, my morality) says that drugs are</i><br>
<i> &gt;evil,</i><br>
<p>
I'm still confused how you came to conclude this in any rational manner.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;it says that the crack neighborhoods are evil</i><br>
<p>
No not evil, Satan is evil, crack neighborhoods are highly undesirable<br>
living envoronments for humans. Don't drag in all the mystical words, it<br>
only clouds the discussion.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The problem lies not within any humans but within the</i><br>
<i> &gt;chemicals making up crack and the plants producing cocaine.</i><br>
<p>
If some humans want to smoke, snif or shoot-up with anything at all. You<br>
have no right whatsoever to deny them this. If they commits crimes while<br>
under influence, you can punish them for this. If they neglect their<br>
children, they will lose their rights as parents. If you say crack should<br>
remain illegal on the basis of its harmfull effect on heath you should also<br>
prohibit:<br>
<p>
Smoking, drinking, eating to much red-meat/fat/minerals/vitamine-C, riding<br>
motorcycles-without-a-helmet, parachute jumping, mountain climbing, working<br>
too hard.... <br>
<p>
(Gosh, I'm beginning to sound like an honest-to-god-libertarian)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Consider crack to be a hostile government equipped with mind control.</i><br>
<p>
Consider crack just another addictive drug whose negative effect and high<br>
price are cause primarily by the fact that it is illegal, every time a<br>
shipment of crack is intercepted by the governement the price goes up,<br>
making the trade more interesting for people who have *nothing* to lose<br>
anymore.<br>
<p>
I once saw an interview with a Colombian coke-farmer. He was asked whether<br>
he was bothered by the fact that American teenagers die from drugs he<br>
helped to produce. His answer: "My children are nearly starving, they could<br>
never afford such an expensive way to die..."<br>
The people producing and distributing drugs have no reason to feel anything<br>
for the western vicitms of 'their' drugs since they themselves are living<br>
in their own hell. They will not stop producing something that has such a<br>
profit-margin, why would they? They are taking care of themselves, just<br>
like us.<br>
As long as drugs remain illegal prices will remain high, trade will be<br>
interesting.<br>
<p>
Ask why people use drugs in the first place. The demand is the problem. Not<br>
the supply. Addres that and you will be going some were.<br>
<p>
I think I'l have me a Scotch and a sigar.<br>
