     <br>
     So my feelings are that if someone wants to do something horrible to<br>
     himself....such as smoke...eat saturated fats....listen to country<br>
     music....watch tv...or engage in some novel surgical procedure...then <br>
     who  is to tell him no?  Of course if he doesn't like the results  <br>
     brought about by such actions....oh well....<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     As long as we're in a urban-oriented market economy where the <br>
     decisions of some end up having a detrimental financial or <br>
     sociological impact on the rest of us, then it's the decision of the <br>
     collective citizens to decide and it's my hope that the "makers" are <br>
     getting fed up with the "takers" and the "fakers" (to use your terms <br>
     &lt;G&gt;).<br>
     <br>
     There are an extraordinarily large number of people who have seen fit <br>
     not to exert discernment concerning the management of their own lives. <br>
     In my mind, participation in a structured community has a membership <br>
     fee.  The addicted, the disinfranchised, the non-contributors need to <br>
     shape up or be shipped out.  An extreme of this is some place like <br>
     Singapore which is cleaner than Disneyland but you get caned, jailed <br>
     and even executed for things we permit in this country for the sake of <br>
     allowing personal freedom or expression.  The price we pay for <br>
     allowing it is crime, filth and a burgeoning segment of human inertia.<br>
     <br>
     I want community connectivity and agreement on common goals that <br>
     enable us to advance and thrive.  What's in the way is ego, avarice <br>
     and apathy.  Our sense of freedom is so skewed by our sense of ego <br>
     that it's amazing that anything productive happens!<br>
     <br>
     So, (off soapbox), if someone's going to smoke themselves into <br>
     high-cost health care they can't pay for, I will seek to prevent them <br>
     from smoking because my sense of compassion isn't willing to <br>
     compromise once they have a life-threatening need for health care <br>
     whether they set it up mindlessly or willingly.  I also want to go <br>
     after their illness providers (tobacco companies).<br>
     <br>
     If someone's going to be diving into nutrition-less food, making them <br>
     listless, obese or subject to heart disease, I would want to educate <br>
     them and I would campaign for the companies who make value-less food <br>
     to produce something for the greater good, not just for their <br>
     stockholders.  It's not okay although we accept it as such in a <br>
     free-for-all (freefall?) market economy.  Accountability is absent and <br>
     profit and success justify anything that the right to free choice <br>
     doesn't cover.  So...I wasn't quite off my soapbox.  I feel better.<br>
     <br>
     Oh and yes, speaking as a gay man and not a transexual, I feel that <br>
     the person desiring a sex change needs a lot of professional advice <br>
     and time before making a physical transition that is so highly-charged <br>
     in our culture.  Gender is paramount in our culture and it's a lot <br>
     more than just futzing with your genitals.<br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>
     Rick<br>
