Hoping to draw to a close this particular tangent, <br>
FWIW, both the Wright Patt and the Eglin museum Web <br>
pages contain essentially the same text:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Originally known as the TFX (Tactical Fighter "X"), <br>
the F-111 was conceived to meet a USAF requirement <br>
for a new tactical fighter-bomber. In 1960, the <br>
Department of Defense combined the USAF's requirement <br>
with a Navy need for a new air superiority fighter, <br>
then launched a competition among aircraft <br>
manufacturers for the final design. In 1962, <br>
General Dynamics and Boeing were selected as <br>
finalists with the General Dynamics TFX design <br>
eventually winning out.<br>
The Navy version was known as the F-111B and the <br>
USAF version the F-111A. The first flight of <br>
the F-111A took place in December 1964, and <br>
the first production models were delivered to <br>
the USAF in 1967. Meanwhile, the Navy's F-111B <br>
program was canceled. In all, 566 F-111s of all <br>
series were built; 159 of them were preproduction <br>
and production F-111As. <br>
&lt;<br>
<p>
All other references I can find, both print and Web, <br>
refer to the actually-fielded AF bomber variant as FB-111A.<br>
The airframe was stretched, it has more tankage,<br>
and of course it has AF-style midair refueling,<br>
rather than the Navy's probe-and-drogue.<br>
<p>
It seems clear to me that Grumman "recycled" the suffix <br>
when the time came to propose an enhanced FB-111A, <br>
and that the F-111B was a substantially different <br>
critter than the FB-111 with any trailing letter. <br>
Find me an FB-111 with a tail hook and <br>
fold-up wings, and I'll reconsider. :)<br>
<p>
The source I find most instructive is<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~pettypi/elevon/baugher_us/f111.html#RTFToC11">http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~pettypi/elevon/baugher_us/f111.html#RTFToC11</a><br>
<p>
where FB-111B and FB-111H are mentioned as <br>
_proposed_ variants of the FB-111A.<br>
<p>
I haven't found any Navy sources on the Web yet.<br>
<p>
Hoping we can now draw the curtains, I remain<br>
<p>
