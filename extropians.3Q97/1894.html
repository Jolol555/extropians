	This probably isn't the last time you'll be asked that question, or something<br>
similar to it.  My opinion is that when someone asks such a question, it<br>
indicates they have Failed To Get The Point.  Shock treatment is indicated;<br>
you should twist their question and make up a coherent, yet strange answer. <br>
Anyway, this is what I'd have said... bearing in mind that the following may<br>
contradict my postulates, but not yours:<br>
<p>
	"Well, fashions come in cycles.  Around 2050, I'd expect a Back-To-Nature<br>
movement to get started.  People would shuck their tentacles and start wearing<br>
good-old-fashioned human bodies again.  The problem is, a lot of them -<br>
particularly the poor ones - might not be able to.  A human body is pretty<br>
expensive to maintain, since you have to run it off of food instead of<br>
electricity.  And a lot of people will be living inside computers; they won't<br>
be able to afford real bodies to begin with.  And some of the children raised<br>
inside computers wouldn't be able to operate a human body if they had one. <br>
So, as usual, you'll see the rich dressed up in elaborate fashions, followed<br>
by a descending hierarchy of imitations.  The real rich will have genuine<br>
1990s-style human bodies with genuine biology, although the brain will<br>
probably still be up-to-date... fashion may make people look like idiots, but<br>
frontal lobotomies will never become popular.  Anyway, next you'll see<br>
middle-class people with lookalike bodies, bodies that seem human on the<br>
outside but run off of electricity.  Then there'll be virtual human avatars<br>
for the people living inside computers.  The children who grow up inside<br>
computers probably won't even be able to operate those, since they're used to<br>
four-dimensional environments or whatever; so they'll rebel and keep on<br>
pushing the bounds of weird new modifications.  Needless to say, I really<br>
don't have the faintest idea of what they'll come up with.  For all I know,<br>
the Back-To-Nature movement could be in 2040 or 2060; but it's the only<br>
fashion trend that I, an unmodified human, would be even vaguely able to understand."<br>
