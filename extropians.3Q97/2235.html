Dear Extropians,<br>
<p>
As far as I could think, the concept of extropy is more important <br>
than it seems:<br>
Let's begin considering the dual oposition:<br>
<p>
                         EXTROPY  x  ENTROPY<br>
<p>
Entropy is said as one of the characteristics of the universe as a <br>
whole. But it is not locally always true ! Extropy seems to be <br>
another physical tendency and, apparently, is strongly related to <br>
existence of life. The chemicals when discovered the concept of <br>
entropy were not studying biochemical reactions... <br>
If one studies physics following a biophysical reverse path, will <br>
identify some reactions and phenomena which  are eminently <br>
extropic... Organism is organization and not disorder...<br>
I should even risk to make an afirmation: LIFE JUST APPEARS WHEN THE <br>
LOCAL PARTIAL DERIVATE dX/dt  &gt; 0  (X=Extropy, complementary of <br>
entropy (S), S+X = ?, cte or not ?)<br>
<p>
Some of the many questions that should arise are:<br>
<p>
1.Which are the fundamental extropic reactions and phenomena and <br>
which are responsible to life creation (or any extropic phenomena <br>
could lead to a certain kind of life form?)?<br>
<p>
2. What conditions lead the same particles set to have extropic or <br>
extropic behaviour? <br>
<p>
3. What conditions would reverse the extropic/entropic state of a set <br>
of particles (including aglomerate objects)?<br>
<p>
4. What were the extropic conditions that have generated life on <br>
Earth ?<br>
<p>
I would invite the creators of the Extropy Group to join us in this <br>
discussion...<br>
<p>
Hugs,<br>
<p>
Gomes. <br>
