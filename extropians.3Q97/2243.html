As I've noted many times, "extropy" is not intended as a technical term. It<br>
is, as Anders says, a loose term. We use it as a label, a metaphor for the<br>
life and intelligence-promoting things we value. The inverse of entropy<br>
already has a term, "negentropy". This had been given both a thermodynamic<br>
and an information-theoretic definition. I feel no need to attempt a<br>
rigorous, scientific definition for "extropy" since it is not intended to<br>
function in that way.<br>
<p>
In regard to negentropy, I still am unsure how to relate the thermodynamic<br>
definition to the information-theoretic definition. The former appears to<br>
be objectively well-defined but, as far as I understand it, the latter is<br>
not since the notion of "information" is not objectively defined. Perhaps<br>
AIT fans can explain this (if they agree that information is not<br>
objectively defined in the context of the definition of entropy). The<br>
difficulty with objectively defining "information" arises from because a<br>
signal only conveys information when apprehended by a mind, and the<br>
information content of any signal seems to depend on the existing contents<br>
of a mind.<br>
