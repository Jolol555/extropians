Lee Daniel Crocker:<br>
<i>&gt;I point this out because I don't want to confuse what I am calling</i><br>
<i>&gt;"compassion" with mere benevolence, as Rand used the term.  The former</i><br>
<i>&gt;is a choice I make freely, and that I would not criticize others for</i><br>
<i>&gt;not making; the latter is a moral imperative.</i><br>
<p>
Moral imperatives imply that there exists an underlying ideology or <br>
dogma to guide them, and I think that we need to move beyond enforced <br>
morality in order to critically assess the importance of lending help <br>
to another human.  It is in this area of human psychology that <br>
Western religion has erected many barriers to understanding (many <br>
other cultures do not utilize the concept of compassion).  We are taught <br>
from childhood by well-meaning adults that to perform an act of <br>
benevolance means that we possess the quality of 'compassion', which <br>
equates to being a 'good' human.  If you were to undertake a serious <br>
examination of any act of benevolence, however, you would probably <br>
find an expected return on the investment of time or worldly <br>
possessions.  The 'bum on the street' example nicely illustrates this, <br>
because many people who would like to think of themselves as <br>
compassionate hesistate to hand money over to someone when they do <br>
not know how it will be used, for food or for substances.<br>
<p>
I do not think that to understand the decisionmaking <br>
process by which someone decides to perform an act of benevolence <br>
necessarily diminishes its value, but I also find little value in <br>
mysticizing the act with the dietrus of religious beliefs.  Actually, <br>
gaining an understanding of why humans perform acts of benevolence (and <br>
an area of 'benevolence theory' focuses on just that) can lead to <br>
structuring ways in which humans can be provided with opportunities to <br>
help each other more effectively.<br>
