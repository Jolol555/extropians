I personally believe that we'll be hit a technological singularity based<br>
in<br>
an SI within 9 years, but feel free to consider this to be crackpot<br>
monomania on my part. See<br>
    <a href="http://www.ShireNet.com/~dgc/singularity/singularity.htm">http://www.ShireNet.com/~dgc/singularity/singularity.htm</a><br>
for details.<br>
<p>
Now for a more reasoned response:<br>
   We appear to be in a decade that is scientifically<br>
similar to the 1890's, in that we believe that we have<br>
a nearly complete understanding of the laws of physics.<br>
Very few phenomena that are actively being investigated<br>
by physicists are unexplained by the "Standard Model."<br>
In the 1890's nearly all phenomena that were being <br>
investigated were explained by the then-current standard<br>
model, consisting of Newton's laws, Maxwell's equations,<br>
and some conservation laws. There were only a very few<br>
things that didn't fit, mostly the "violet catastrophe"<br>
and a few cosmological details. The prevailing attitude<br>
was a belief that only a few details remained to be worked<br>
out.<br>
<p>
Within 15 years, the advent of quantum mechanics and<br>
relativity had thrown the world of physics into a ferment.<br>
<p>
Now, we can refine your question: what is it that remains<br>
unexplained by the standard model? the answer, according to<br>
all popular accounts, is gravity. We know it's there, and we<br>
know the inverse square law, but we don't see how it works.<br>
Sure, we see many pieces of the puzzle, the most beautiful<br>
piece IMO being general relativity. But the pieces don't<br>
all fit, and they don't fit into the standard model. A whole<br>
bunck of theorists are trying very hard to build a GUT<br>
(Grand Unified Theory) but they appear to represent a minor<br>
ripple on the quiet pond of our overall complacency.<br>
<p>
So, again borrowing from "The Physics of Star Trek", by<br>
Krause, if we can learn to manipulate gravity, we can<br>
perhaps get past the hard limits on acceleration and<br>
energy usage that constrain even a modest effort in<br>
space exploration.<br>
<p>
That's it for physics. Anyone want to try in another field?<br>
