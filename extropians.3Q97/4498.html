Dear General McCaffrey,                       29 September 1997<br>
<p>
      The White House was kind enough to give me your email address, after <br>
I had indicated that i wished to discuss the 'War on Drugs' problems with <br>
you.<br>
<p>
<p>
      I don't use illicit drugs.  I advise others not to use them either.  <br>
My 'pleasure' is an American Synetics MindLab sound-and-light computer <br>
set-up, which entrains EEG frequencies to give near-instant relaxation, <br>
sleep, alertness or learning modes.<br>
<p>
      As does the Economist magazine (and many other top-flight analysts) <br>
I consider the 'War on Drugs' to be unwinnable.  Only the American and <br>
other peoples lose.  Synthetic chemistry makes prohibition impossible, <br>
even if we could stop international narcotics trading -- impossible, since <br>
the world's intelligence operatives run most of the trade, using the drug <br>
laws to put their competitors out of business, as well as keeping street <br>
prices high.  Kids in New York have problems making minimum wage through <br>
dealing drugs.<br>
<p>
      Worst of all: America is slowly being destroyed as users become <br>
dealers, while draconian 'anti-drug' laws turn the entire country into an <br>
arbitrary maximum-security prison, with hundreds of thousands of prisoners <br>
actually incarcerated, at great expense in suffering and prison costs. <br>
Increasingly, the mores and practices of maximum-security prisons are to <br>
be seen in the wider society.<br>
<p>
      What is to be done?<br>
<p>
<p>
      Is there any real alternative to openly-sold less-harmful <br>
substances, like Dr. Alexander Schulgin's 'Ecstasy', ferinstance?  Or my <br>
Synetics MindLab gadget, for a drug-free 'high'?<br>
<p>
<p>
I look forward to your reply.<br>
<p>
<p>
Yours Sincerely,<br>
<p>
<p>
Tony Hollick<br>

<i>&gt;   International Efforts to Combat Money Laundering</i><br>
<i>&gt;               William C. Gilmore (ed.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;            Grotius Publications Limited, </i><br>
<i>&gt;           Cambridge, 1992, 335pp, £48 (pbk)</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 (ISBN 0 521 46305 X)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    Money Laundering:  A Practical Guide to the New</i><br>
<i>&gt; Legislation</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Rowan Bosworth-Davies and Graham Saltmarsh</i><br>
<i>&gt;            Chapman &amp; Hall, London, 1994, </i><br>
<i>&gt;              xii and 304pp, £49.50 (hbk)</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 (ISBN 0 412 57530 2)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The first of these books is a collection of treaties, plus other</i><br>
<i>&gt; documents, concerned with the international fight against</i><br>
<i>&gt; money laundering.  The second explains how these treaties</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been enacted into, and are enforced under, the laws of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the United Kingdom.  Both works will repay the closest</i><br>
<i>&gt; study.  In clear detail, they show the growth of what must</i><br>
<i>&gt; be called a New World Order, and how, without some</i><br>
<i>&gt; interposing cause, this may produce a universal slide into</i><br>
<i>&gt; despotism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The fight against money laundering begins with realising</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the "War on Drugs" has been lost.  When goods are</i><br>
<i>&gt; portable and easily concealed, and when demand for them is</i><br>
<i>&gt; strong enough to bear almost any cost of bringing them to</i><br>
<i>&gt; market, the main effect of prohibition will be to put a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bounty on crime.  For all the efforts of the past three</i><br>
<i>&gt; generations, illegal drugs are available in most high security</i><br>
<i>&gt; prisons.  In much of the West, street prices have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; stable or even falling since 1980.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The official response, however, has not been to give in and</i><br>
<i>&gt; legalise the trade, but to expand the War to a front where</i><br>
<i>&gt; previously there had been few hostilities.  While keeping up</i><br>
<i>&gt; their efforts against the trade itself, the authorities have</i><br>
<i>&gt; turned increasingly to confiscating its proceeds.  This new</i><br>
<i>&gt; approach has three alleged benefits:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First, it will deprive criminals of their incentive to enter</i><br>
<i>&gt; and remain in the trade;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Second, it will allow the punishing of those in charge of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; trade - people who never touch or see illegal drugs, but to</i><br>
<i>&gt; whom the main profits ultimately flow;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Third, it can make the War on Drugs self-supporting, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps yield a surplus for other public spending.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is, however, one practical difficulty.  Before the</i><br>
<i>&gt; authorities can confiscate the money, they must find it.  To</i><br>
<i>&gt; do this, they must keep it from being merged beyond recall</i><br>
<i>&gt; into the general flow of investment.  This involves ending</i><br>
<i>&gt; bank secrecy and imposing a mass of financial regulation. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, most people - especially the rich - dislike having their</i><br>
<i>&gt; lives pried into.  Nor do banks like higher costs and</i><br>
<i>&gt; limitations on what business they can do.  And so, given</i><br>
<i>&gt; the present freedom of capital markets, no government</i><br>
<i>&gt; acting alone can afford a strict policy of confiscation.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; would, sooner or later, cause a flight of transactions to</i><br>
<i>&gt; more liberal places.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The solution has been to try making everywhere in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; world equally illiberal.  Such  was the purpose of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Narcotic Drugs and Narcotic Substances, signed in Vienna</i><br>
<i>&gt; in December 1988 [full text in Gilmore, pp.75-97].  This is</i><br>
<i>&gt; one of the most important international treaties of the past</i><br>
<i>&gt; 50 years.  It not merely requires its signatory states to</i><br>
<i>&gt; criminalise the laundering of drug money, and to confiscate</i><br>
<i>&gt; it where found, but lays down so far as possible a common</i><br>
<i>&gt; wording for the criminal statutes, and a common mode of</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcement.  It also requires full and prompt cooperation</i><br>
<i>&gt; between the signatory states for the enforcement of these</i><br>
<i>&gt; laws anywhere in the world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Convention had little direct or immediate effect on</i><br>
<i>&gt; British law.  Many of its requirements, indeed, had already</i><br>
<i>&gt; been met in the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986.  Most</i><br>
<i>&gt; others were only met in the Criminal Justice Act 1993,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which enacts the European Community Directive of 1991</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the Prevention of the Use of the Financial System for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Purpose of Money Laundering [full text in Gilmore,</i><br>
<i>&gt; pp.250-67].  This itself derives from the Vienna Convention</i><br>
<i>&gt; only through the Council of Europe Convention on</i><br>
<i>&gt; Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Proceeds from Crime 1990 [full text in Gilmore, pp.177-</i><br>
<i>&gt; 91].  Even so, this country is fast becoming a financial</i><br>
<i>&gt; police state of the kind agreed at Vienna - and where the</i><br>
<i>&gt; process cannot be traced to the Convention, it can be traced</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the same international pressures of which the Convention</i><br>
<i>&gt; is itself a result.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Let me explain.  When I talk about a New World Order, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; do not mean some grand conspiracy of bankers, or Jews, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; Illuminati, or even - with far more probability - the</i><br>
<i>&gt; American Government.  There are countries where policy is</i><br>
<i>&gt; largely dictated from outside.  But for rich and powerful</i><br>
<i>&gt; countries, the truth is more complex.  Most international</i><br>
<i>&gt; obligations imposed on this country, for example, were not</i><br>
<i>&gt; only consented to by our rulers, but were usually proposed</i><br>
<i>&gt; by them, and are enforced by agencies in which our own</i><br>
<i>&gt; countrymen often occupy senior positions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Where others see conspiracies, I see public choice</i><br>
<i>&gt; economics.  Whenever a government tries to do something</i><br>
<i>&gt; dangerous or unnecessary, like banning drugs or educating</i><br>
<i>&gt; the poor, it must set up an agency through which to spend</i><br>
<i>&gt; the allocated funds.  Once employed, the agents will - as if</i><br>
<i>&gt; directed by an invisible hand - start to find more and more</i><br>
<i>&gt; justifications for expanding their status and numbers.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; collect the statistics.  They know which ones to publish and</i><br>
<i>&gt; which to hold back.  They are the politicians' first and</i><br>
<i>&gt; favoured source of advice.  They have their pet journalists. </i><br>
<i>&gt; They trade favours with the relevant interest groups.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; know exactly how to give themselves a pleasing life, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; how to see off threats to it.  Unless the money runs out, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; the public turns really nasty, they can write their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; budget cheques.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By natural extension, the same is now happening at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; international level - though with potentially far worse</i><br>
<i>&gt; consequences.  In the first place, there is limitless money: </i><br>
<i>&gt; budgets would need to swell unimaginably large to reach</i><br>
<i>&gt; even one per cent of gross planetary product.  In the</i><br>
<i>&gt; second, public anger seldom crosses borders; and, if all else</i><br>
<i>&gt; fails, the politicians and bureaucrats in one country can</i><br>
<i>&gt; shelter behind the excuse of treaty obligations that cannot be</i><br>
<i>&gt; unilaterally be cast off - not, at least, without consequences</i><br>
<i>&gt; more horrible than words exist to describe.  Third, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcement of international treaties means the growth of</i><br>
<i>&gt; what is in effect an international bureaucracy.  The local</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcers of a treaty may be citizens of the signatory states,</i><br>
<i>&gt; who will live and work in their home countries, and may</i><br>
<i>&gt; even occupy positions in the domestic administration.  Yet</i><br>
<i>&gt; these are people who, by virtue of the agreements they</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforce, and the contacts they make and maintain in other</i><br>
<i>&gt; countries, are members of an international order.  And, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; at least the case of money laundering, they will share an</i><br>
<i>&gt; agenda that is often deeply hostile to their native</i><br>
<i>&gt; institutions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This can be seen - expressed with almost naive honesty - in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the book by Messrs Bosworth-Davies and Saltmarsh.  Both</i><br>
<i>&gt; are British police officers:  the latter is a departmental head</i><br>
<i>&gt; at the National Criminal Intelligence Service.  Both take it</i><br>
<i>&gt; for granted that the world needs an international police</i><br>
<i>&gt; force.  Both are unable to believe that anyone can</i><br>
<i>&gt; disinterestedly object to the necessary harmonisations of</i><br>
<i>&gt; law, and the corresponding abolition of Common Law</i><br>
<i>&gt; protections.  They "know one senior clearing banker who</i><br>
<i>&gt; has described this [money laundering] legislation as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; nearest thing he has experienced to</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'McCarthyism'...".[p.172]  Of course, they see things</i><br>
<i>&gt; differently.  The legislation</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     discloses, on mature reflection, a set of carefully</i><br>
<i>&gt;     structured laws which, with good will, due</i><br>
<i>&gt;     diligence and a modicum of responsible attention</i><br>
<i>&gt;     from the industry as a whole, should not prove</i><br>
<i>&gt;     too burdensome.  Indeed, the authors believe that</i><br>
<i>&gt;     some of the regulatory requirements have been</i><br>
<i>&gt;     diluted too much already, in a misguided attempt</i><br>
<i>&gt;     to placate the sensibilities of certain sectors of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     industry....[Ibid.]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; With people like this advising the politicians and lecturing</i><br>
<i>&gt; the rest of us, little wonder the Drug Trafficking Offences</i><br>
<i>&gt; Act predates the Vienna Convention by two years!  Though</i><br>
<i>&gt; they will hotly disagree - and even perhaps consider a libel</i><br>
<i>&gt; writ - Messrs Bosworth-Davies and Saltmarsh cannot be</i><br>
<i>&gt; regarded as our countrymen.  More at home in a gathering</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Bulgarian or Filipino police chiefs than with any of us,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are foreigners with British passports.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Somewhat less honest, though still interesting, is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Explanatory Report of the Committee of Experts who</i><br>
<i>&gt; drafted the Council of Europe Convention [full text in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Gilmore, pp.192-237].  Though formally subordinate to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; committee of the various European Ministers of Justice,</i><br>
<i>&gt; these experts plainly saw their first duty as lying elsewhere. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Call it "the international community" or their own order,</i><br>
<i>&gt; their duty was collective and not to any single country.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Look at their dislike of the narrow focus of the Vienna</i><br>
<i>&gt; Convention.  They wanted something that would also allow</i><br>
<i>&gt; confiscation for</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     terrorist offences, organised crime, violent crimes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     offences involving the sexual exploitation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;     children and young persons, extortion,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     kidnapping, environmental offences, economic</i><br>
<i>&gt;     fraud, insider trading and other serious offences.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     [Gilmore, p.204]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But they had to concede that not every European country</i><br>
<i>&gt; might like its own laws against these acts to be written by</i><br>
<i>&gt; an international committee.  And so they allowed each</i><br>
<i>&gt; signatory state to reserve whatever of these acts to its own</i><br>
<i>&gt; legislative process.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     The experts agreed, however, that such states</i><br>
<i>&gt;     should review their legislation periodically and</i><br>
<i>&gt;     expand the applicability of confiscation measures,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     in order to be able to restrict the reservations</i><br>
<i>&gt;     subsequently as much as possible. [Ibid.]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And this is only the beginning.  As yet, the shape of world</i><br>
<i>&gt; government exists barely in outline.  But the tendency ought</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be plain.  Power is moving from national - and mostly</i><br>
<i>&gt; democratic - governments to unaccountable and even</i><br>
<i>&gt; invisible bureaucracies.  Liberal institutions that are often</i><br>
<i>&gt; the work of ages are being hammered into the transmitters</i><br>
<i>&gt; of unlimited power.  We are beginning to known how</i><br>
<i>&gt; people in the Greek city states felt after absorption into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Roman Empire.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When the American militiamen cry out that the United</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nations is about to invade in black helicopters and plant</i><br>
<i>&gt; microcomputers in their bottoms, I am at least sceptical. </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is not the New World Order that I see.  What I do see</i><br>
<i>&gt; is actually worse.  We can shoot the helicopters down, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; dig out the microcomputers, and put the ringleaders on</i><br>
<i>&gt; trial.  We can go about playing the hero of our choice from</i><br>
<i>&gt; Star Wars.  But in the real world, there is no Death Star to</i><br>
<i>&gt; blow up - no Darth Vadar to push into the void.  There is</i><br>
<i>&gt; just a huge, elastic network of people, all acting in what</i><br>
<i>&gt; they believe is the public good, most with some degree of</i><br>
<i>&gt; public support.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How this kind of despotism can be resisted is another</i><br>
<i>&gt; question, and I have said enough already.  But I will repeat</i><br>
<i>&gt; - the books here reviewed do repay a very close study.  At</i><br>
<i>&gt; the very least, it is useful to see the enemy's future plan</i><br>
<i>&gt; laid out in such detail.</i><br>
