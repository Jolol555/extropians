You've got to read these things more carefully.  The pictures aren't pictures<br>
of chromosomes, as just glancing at them will tell.  They claim to be<br>
pictures of "chromozones", whatever they are.  Neither my dictionary, my<br>
medical dictionary, nor any of my biology texts has any definition or<br>
reference to "chromozone".  I couldn't find any other reference to<br>
"chromozone" on the Web, either.<br>
<p>
Pardon me, but I just couldn't resist some sly comments below.  Danny didn't<br>
quote these, but I didn't know how else to distinguish them.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;This regularly updated site by Freddy Silva features </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the work of Colin Andrews,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Gerald Hawkins and other respected </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;researchers, bringing you factual research</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;dedicated to the appreciation and </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;understanding of crop circles, the most dynamic form of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;multi-dimensional communication ever </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to appear in the history of our home planet.</i><br>
<p>
Well, they *are* multidimensional.  2, to be precise, just like any painting.<br>
 As to "most dynamic ... in history", let's see - the Sistine Chapel, the<br>
Bible, the Analects, Monet's Waterlilies, Beethoven's late quartets, the<br>
Declaration of Independece, the Origin of Species.  I could go on for<br>
chapters, literally.  Methinks somebody doesn't get out much  :-)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;As crop circles proliferate across the entire globe the vast amount of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;conclusive scientific evidence continues to be silenced. </i><br>
<p>
I swear, this is practically the mating call of the pseudoscientist.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I hope that through this site</i><br>

<p>
Isn't it interesting that in spite of thousands of years of predictions the<br>
aliens or transdimensional ghosties who supposedly made these couldn't<br>
actually do it until shown how by a couple of Brit pranksters?<br>

<p>
Gosh, just like somebody is *learning* to make them.<br>
