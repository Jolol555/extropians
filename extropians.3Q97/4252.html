True. The problem is, as Richard Plourde nicely explained, that we<br>
*need* a lot of the terminology to work with the questions. An obvious<br>
problem is that english lacks many of the words needed to describe<br>
what we are stadying: how do you denote the medial temporal lobe<br>
in english? ("the inner parts of the part of the brain beneath the temple"<br>
is far too imprecise) The same goes for the processes and methods.<br>
<p>
But on the other hand, we do not need this terminology as much<br>
when trying to explain our discoveries to non-scientists in an<br>
imprecise manner (we still need it to communicate accurately with<br>
each other). I'm convinced that it is true that if you cannot explain<br>
your field of study to an interested 10-year old, then you haven't<br>
understood it yourself. So I really think we scientists have an<br>
obligation to explain things simply to anybody interested in what<br>
we have to say. <br>
