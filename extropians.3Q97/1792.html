Given that a short while ago you were asserting that none of the<br>
definitions of complexity currently in use are satisfactory, it<br>
seems strange for you to be claiming the "we know for sure" anything<br>
about the relative complexity of different things.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; But is complexity really the issue here?</i><br>
<p>
I doubt it. What I was questioning was your straightforward assertion<br>
that the shape of a Mandelbrot set is more complex than the shape<br>
of a grape.  I don't think we know enough yet about the shapes of<br>
grapes (or about complexity) to be able to make claims like that.<br>
<p>
I think that Hara Ra's Mreal/Preal distinction is an ontological<br>
division between kinds of information structures that can be grown<br>
in human brains. Some, like brain-models of grapes that we use to<br>
perceive and think about grapes, originate mostly in sense-data<br>
and are "open" to being further informed by further examination of<br>
physical objects and processes (e. g.  grapes). Others, like<br>
brain-models of Mandelbrot sets that we use to perceive and think<br>
about Mandelbrot sets, originate relatively independently of<br>
sense-data and are relatively "closed", since all the information<br>
about them is *implicit* in a short, complete definition which<br>
algorithmically compresses the entire Mandelbrot set into a<br>
comprehensible (to humans) piece of mathematics. I doubt that grapes<br>
are thus losslessly compressible, and so in that sense, grapes are<br>
more complex than Mandelbrot sets. But is that sense the sense most<br>
people are trying to get at when they talk about relative complexity?<br>
I don't know.<br>
<p>
I suspect the sense of complexity discussed above is the sense<br>
used in algorithmic information theory, but I'm not sure. Does<br>
anyone want to fill us in on this point?<br>
