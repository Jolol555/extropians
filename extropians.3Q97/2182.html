Thanks for the many replies on this topic.  <br>
<p>
Taking raw "votes", I seem to get the most votes for <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) "Explaining Product Bans" (<a href="http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/whyban.ps">http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/whyban.ps</a>)</i><br>
<p>
But I think I might see a pattern.  My libertarian friends like this<br>
one, my older friends (like my parents) who have the most contact with<br>
current health care systems like this one<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1) "Incentive Contracts" (<a href="http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/buyhealth.html">http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/buyhealth.html</a>)</i><br>
<p>
and my academic/abstract-thinker friends like this one:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3) "Why Do We Disagree?" (<a href="http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/calibration.ps">http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/calibration.ps</a>)</i><br>
<p>
I'd be interested to hear of evidence against this theory, that the<br>
distribution of responses mainly reflects the distribution of health<br>
care contact vs. libertarians vs. academics among those I've asked.<br>
<p>
My other general comment is that I'm now thinking about these<br>
alternatives more in terms of what there is for me to learn.  In the<br>
"Incentive Contracts" project, I would mainly be trying to convince<br>
non-economists of some standard results known to economists.  I'd have<br>
a lot to learn about institutional details, and about how to perusade,<br>
but I'm not sure that would keep my interest up.  The "Why we<br>
disagree" project, on the other hand, is most centered on a question I<br>
don't know the answer to, and so I am most personally curious to work<br>
on this project to learn the answer to the question.  The "Product<br>
Bans" project is in the middle; I think I understand the basic<br>
dynamic, but there are lots of details I don't understand to work on.<br>
So I'm wondering how much weight I should give to selfish curiousity,<br>
vs. "making an impact".  Tough choice. <br>
<p>
Now for responses to specific comments:<br>

<p>
I understand your point, but I'm more optimistic about the long term.<br>
I think, for example, that many people have been influenced by<br>
understanding Bayesian decision theory.  I think I was.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;gives me a very uncomfortable feeling.  "Sorry, we've decided it's cheaper</i><br>
<i>&gt;just to pay out your life insurance than to cure you.  Have a nice death."</i><br>
<p>
Unless we want to pay any arbitrary amount for any small health help,<br>
we *must* accept that at some point possible cares are not given.<br>
The issue is to induce the right cost/benefit tradeoffs.<br>
As you note in a later post, we now do this indirectly via "standard<br>
practice", "its experimental", and other indirect labels.  I'm<br>
proposing we be very direct about making cost/benefit tradeoffs. <br>
I'm curious to see what you fear about such directness.<br>

I'd be interested to hear more about your concerns here.<br>
