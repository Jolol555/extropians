	The following is from a private message that I sent to Eric Watt<br>
Forste yesterday.  It is applicable here, for it gives yet another<br>
interpretation of Rucker's intended message.  Upon rereading, I don't<br>
believe that he intended anything nearly as interesting as we have been<br>
considering.  I believe that he is simply stating that the concept of<br>
Omega is given a priori, then further understood, along with lower<br>
infinities, empirically.  I also give a brief refutation of the Kantian<br>
view of this, in the following text:<br>
<p>
	I did...return to the text to ponder the surrounding paragraphs<br>
and I have come up with this:   In the sentence immediately following the<br>
paragraph that I extracted the original object of debate from, Rucker says<br>
this, "We have a primitive concept of infinity".  He then goes on to<br>
mention how it is inspired, not giving a solid reason, but rather<br>
referring to the "same deep substrate of mind that conditions religious<br>
thought", this can be pre or post rational, but it really doesn't matter<br>
in this case, because he goes on to further clarify our conception of<br>
infinities.  "By means of set-theoretic analysis of Absolute Infinity [our<br>
omega], we attain knowledge of many lower infinities-the transfinite<br>
ordinals and cardinals".  <br>
	My revised view of his text tells me that the initial concept of<br>
infinity, as Absolute Infinity, is given a priori, whereas we arrive at<br>
further understanding empirically.  This isn't the Kantian synthetic a<br>
priori, for in this case it is given first, then further understood.  In<br>
the case of a synthetic a priori, I believe that one arrives at or <br>
discovers an innate concept empirically, only then recognizing it as an a<br>
priori and eternal truth.  Hence, we are given new knowledge (synthetic)<br>
from an eternal truth.  This of course could just be my own twist on Kant.<br>
A fun subject nonetheless, and great fuel for hours of intensely enjoyable <br>
debate.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure about this. A priori knowledge is supposed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be had without appeal to perception. Rucker might agree that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the existence of omega is not an analytic truth, but he</i><br>
<i>&gt; might say that we only know about omega because we "perceive"</i><br>
<i>&gt; it (again, where "perceive" would have to include the alleged</i><br>
<i>&gt; faculty by which one is directly aware of mathematical</i><br>
<i>&gt; entities).</i><br>
<p>
<p>
	Much agreed!  One must note, however, that your definition of<br>
"perceive" is essential to this statement.<br>
