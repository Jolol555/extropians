<i>&gt;      physics involved, my question is more a request for illumination.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;      What about the notion of interdimensional travel where space is </i><br>
<i>&gt;      "folded" as in Dune or notions (however unfounded) like the wormhold </i><br>
<i>&gt;      in DS9?  Perhaps there are means of sustaining matter as one traverses </i><br>
<i>&gt;      physical dimensions into ones where distance isn't an issue.</i><br>
<p>
We have had some detailed discussions on wormholes on this list in the<br>
past, and there is a good article in back issues of Extropy.  Without<br>
wormholes, it would probably still be possible, but expensive.<br>
<p>
Years ago, people proposed ramjets which could get up to near lightspeed<br>
by fusing interstellar hydrogen.  Today we might envision using nanotech<br>
to upload all the passengers into some kind of solid state form, perhaps<br>
suspended, so that higher accelerations could be used.  In one design<br>
I saw, the interstellar craft was basically a gun able to shoot its<br>
payload at close to the speed of light.  The whole gun was launched at<br>
near the speed of light from the home system (maybe with a light sail<br>
or EM launcher so the g load is relatively moderate).  Then on arrival,<br>
it would shoot out the tiny "bullet" backwards, opposite to the direction<br>
it was travelling.  This would slow the payload down so it would enter<br>
the target system at a moderate speed and crash into some body where it<br>
could rebuild the passengers.  But the bullet would pull a lot of g's!<br>
<p>
Once arrived, there would not be much point in travelling back and forth.<br>
EM waves could be used to communicate any results as fast as travelling,<br>
and perhaps even to send compressed brain descriptions so travellers could<br>
"beam over" between star systems.<br>
<p>
All this would suggest that UFO's, if they existed, would be<br>
interplanetary rather than interstellar craft.  They might even be<br>
strictly for use in the near earth region.  They would be built and<br>
launched somewhere nearby, either on earth or perhaps the moon.<br>
<p>
However this is really just entertaining speculation; actually the<br>
ostensible characteristics of the craft (their ability to crash, for<br>
example) don't seem consistent with the kind of technology we are talking<br>
about here.<br>
