Eliezer writes--<br>
: There's no way I can be sure.  If I'd grown up [...] in the beginning<br>
: of the 19th century, I might think slavery was a fine idea.  There's<br>
: no *instinct* that acts against such ideas.  Quite the contrary.<br>
: Even I am not arrogant enough to assume that I, through sheer logic<br>
: and innate moral superiority, could duplicate a hundred years of<br>
: hard-earned experience.<br>
<p>
Yeah, I remember as a child (before my meme-antibodies were mature)<br>
thinking, secretly, that eliminating or repressing the inferiors<br>
seemed like good sport.<br>
<p>
But what *experience* cured us of such notions?<br>
How did slavery change, to persuade us that it's a bad thing?<br>
<p>
: Someone once tried to tell me that killing was inherently abhorrent.<br>
: Another quote I ran across, from "Mindkiller", stated that too many<br>
: people of the video generation are convinced they have what it takes<br>
: to kill in cold blood.<br>
<p>
And you're sure it's not a pose, like "vampire" makeup?<br>
Or conventional antihumanism, inspired by Christianity (Man is Fallen<br>
and Depraved) or statism (Man is too dangerous to be let loose) or<br>
environmentalism (Man is a cancer on the flesh of Gaia) ?<br>
<p>
: Perhaps I'm from the video generation, then, but it seems to me that<br>
: civilization is a thin veneer over basic human nature, and basic human<br>
: nature has no problem with killing at all.  I hope I never need to<br>
: kill anyone, but if I have to, I don't think that doing so would be<br>
: either difficult or traumatic.  Uncouple civilized restraints and<br>
: killing would barely ripple the emotional surface of the mind.<br>
: Still, I could be wrong.  With luck, time will never tell.<br>
<p>
Some say that cold-blooded killing usually requires a sort of<br>
self-hypnosis with the idea that the Enemy is not human.<br>
<p>
: If genocide were inherently abhorrent, it wouldn't happen so often.<br>
: It took the Holocaust, which is inherently abhorrent,<br>
<p>
[begging the question!]<br>
<p>
: to create our modern taboo against it.<br>
<p>
It took a war in which THE LOSERS were guilty of genocide.<br>
To kill Nazis, Allied soldiers had to be taught that Nazis are inhuman.<br>
When it came out that the Nazis had a program of genocide, it was easy<br>
to make the association that genocide is inhuman.<br>
<p>
: Perhaps that very taboo is responsible for our refusal to acknowledge<br>
: the lesser genocides.  Still, we do try to stop them - although not<br>
: with enough force.<br>
<p>
Wanna know what made me sick?  Seeing Harlan Ellison (a Jew) on<br>
_Politically Incorrect_ defending one of the FBI's famous recent<br>
slaughters of the differently-opinionated.<br>
