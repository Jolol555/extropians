<p>
Well, you will note that I said remind *everyone*.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They make take offense, but I would stand by my view that their belief is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not in accordance with the evidence. Surely you are not suggesting that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ph.D. in physics can rationally hold that "every word of the Old Testament</i><br>
<i>&gt; is unvarnished and unmetaphorical fact"? The Earth is only a few thousand</i><br>
<i>&gt; years old? God created Adam and Eve and there was no evolution. Such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; physics Ph.D. would have a faith in both senses of the term -- a belief in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a doctrine, and a belief insensitive to evidence.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, he believes that the Universe is several billion years old depending<br>
on Hubble constant, and that evolution is obviously the explanation for all<br>
human biology.  In fact, he has exactly your attitude towards creationists who<br>
make up elaborate reasons why evolution has some tiny flaw.<br>
<p>
Again, there are minds that think as well as you do, only differently.<br>
