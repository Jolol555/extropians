<p>
This wasn't my take on Nicholas' scenario.  Everyone lives in VR, and<br>
nobody is allowed out into the physical world.  So life would indeed have<br>
some limitations.  But this is far from a Borg collective.  The individual<br>
lives of people within the VR could be as diverse and varied as under any<br>
such scenario.<br>
<p>
In fact we have often supposed that people would voluntarily move into<br>
VR once it developed to the point where it was advantageous.  In VR you<br>
could have magical powers over your environment, making objects appear<br>
and disappear at will.  You could have the most sumptuous possible living<br>
arrangments, culinary delights, every sensual pleasure imaginable.  You<br>
could possibly even adjust and manipulate your own mentality directly.<br>
<p>
Plus, you can probably run a lot faster in VR than in the real world,<br>
so to the extent that there is an economy based on producing new ideas,<br>
VR inhabitants are going to be much more competitive.<br>
<p>
Actually, Nicholas' scenario could be adjusted to allow people to "go<br>
native" and live out in the real world, as long as they were restricted<br>
from access to technology which could threaten the computers running the<br>
VR where everybody lives.  A few die-hard realists living on a south seas<br>
island (who insist on walking on *real sand*, not the VR stuff that just<br>
*seems* real) wouldn't bother anyone.<br>
<p>
Still, Nicholas' idea can hardly be considered consistent with principles<br>
of non-coercion, especially in the early days when people are rounded up to<br>
be vaporized (and uploaded).  Don't forget, a lot of people even on this<br>
list have resisted the idea that uploading preserves their identity.  So<br>
any forced move to VR is going to be heavy on the "force" aspect.<br>
