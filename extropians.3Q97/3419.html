But this is precisely the point; by any *rational* definition of poverty<br>
there are few poor people in the West today. The US government's<br>
definition of poverty is something that most of the planet's population<br>
can only aspire to. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not only that- to use that line of thinking to</i><br>

<i>&gt; downright mean. </i><br>
<p>
How many people starve to death every day in the US? Every study I've seen<br>
shows that obesity is far more of a threat to the average American than<br>
starvation. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The bottom is still the bottom. </i><br>
<p>
But in the West today the bottom typically includes a place to live,<br>
health care, food, beer, a TV, a fridge and quite possibly a car. I've<br>
been to places where most people don't have those things, so forgive me<br>
for not falling over in a fit of compassion for "poor" Westerners. <br>
