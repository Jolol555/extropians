Friends,<br>
<p>
These issues on the California Governor's desk are, quite<br>
literally, a matter of life or death.  The attached is the latest<br>
alert from the GOA (Gun Owners of America), a grassroots<br>
organization much more effective - and principled - than the<br>
NRA.<br>
<p>
Note the URL <a href="http://www.ca.gov/t/governor/mail.html">http://www.ca.gov/t/governor/mail.html</a> , <br>
an online feedback form to Pete Wilson.  It's worth the time<br>
to fill it out to register your protest.  Please pass this on to <br>
your friends.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
Russell<br>

&gt; 
&gt; Multi-State Rallying Call: Time For Some Gun Owner "Reciprocity"
&gt; 
&gt; September 19, 1997
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear GOA Supporter:
&gt; 
&gt; Your fellow gun owners in California could use a helping hand right
&gt; now. An anti-gun legislature heavily weighted with "idealistic"
&gt; freshmen has dropped a slew of gun bans on the desk of California
&gt; Governor Pete Wilson. Included are some of the most sweeping and
&gt; blatantly unconstitutional restrictions ever passed by a state
&gt; legislature.
&gt; 
&gt;  ** You can make a difference because Pete Wilson is more
&gt;     Politician than Governor! **
&gt; 
&gt; You must urge Gov. Wilson to veto these anti-gun bills. This alert
&gt; is being sent to subscribers in states which will have an early
&gt; impact on the 2000 presidential election -- as well as to our many
&gt; California supporters. It is no secret that Pete Wilson has long
&gt; harbored presidential ambitions; he will probably seek the
&gt; Republican nomination in 2000.
&gt; 
&gt; Whenever a politician aspires to higher office, he starts paying
&gt; more attention to "prospective constituents" and "voting blocks".
&gt; This is an excellent chance to convince Gov. Wilson that gun owners
&gt; are vocal and committed -- moreover, the political situation means
&gt; that non-residents can tip the scales and help prevent California
&gt; from becoming almost as restrictive as Washington, D.C.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, California gun owners need to speak up as well --
&gt; Governor Wilson must be convinced to veto the following bills:
&gt; 
&gt;    SB 500.  This monstrosity would ban *every* firearm the
&gt;             anti-gun bureaucrats decree from on high as being
&gt;             "non-sporting" in nature.
&gt; 
&gt;    SB 513.  Hayden's one-handgun-a-month. Weakened, but still
&gt;             deadly.
&gt; 
&gt;    AB 304.  This bill would disarm all concealed carry permit
&gt;             holders when they are merely passengers in a vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt;    AB 488.  A nasty little aspect of this bill is that it is
&gt;             basically the same as SB 500, except that it exempts
&gt;             "cowboy-style" handguns -- in the hopes that Gov.
&gt;             Wilson will sign the lesser of two evils.
&gt; 
&gt;    AB 491.  Unfairly subjects adult gun owners to prosecution when a
&gt;             juvenile removes a firearm from one's premises. The
&gt;             previous juvenile age was set at 14 or under; this bill
&gt;             increases the age to 16.
&gt; 
&gt;    AB 991.  All new California residents would have to comply with
&gt;             the state's myriad handgun restrictions within a mere 60
&gt;             days of setting foot on California soil.
&gt; 
&gt;    AB 1221. Currently, many types of ammunition are available only
&gt;             to those 18 years of age or older. This bill hikes the
&gt;             disarmament to all who are under 21, and thus strips the
&gt;             right of self-defense from 18-21 year olds.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; As you can see, were California to adopt these measures atop what is
&gt; already one of the most restrictive firearms codes in the country,
&gt; millions of law-abiding residents would be denied their rights as
&gt; guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.  Please take a few moments to
&gt; come to the aid of these endangered citizens by contacting Gov.
&gt; Wilson. A sample non-resident letter is included after the contact
&gt; information. If you live in California, help those who are helping
&gt; you by helping yourself.

&gt; Governor Pete Wilson

&gt; ****************** clip-and-fax or print-and-mail ******************
&gt; 
&gt; The Honorable Pete Wilson
&gt; State Capitol Building
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Governor Wilson:
&gt; 
&gt; I have watched with increasing dismay as the legislature has
&gt; presented you with numerous bills of an unconstitutional and
&gt; anti-gun nature. As a law-abiding gun owner, I resent the
&gt; self-styled "moralism" of lawmakers who think that disarming those
&gt; who respect the law will somehow protect us from those who do not.
&gt; I urge you to uphold your oath to the Constitution and your
&gt; responsibility to your constituents by vetoing any and all bills
&gt; which infringe upon the right to keep and bear arms.
&gt; 
&gt; You should know that I am a resident of __________, an early
&gt; primary state. Why, then, do I care about whether you allow the
&gt; citizens of California to fall prey to the anti-gunners? In addition
&gt; to my heartfelt belief that we are all Americans and deserve the
&gt; same protections wherever we go, the answer is that I recognize you
&gt; are more than the Governor of California. You are a national figure,
&gt; and as such must come to realize that gun owners are a vocal and
&gt; politically active segment of our society. It is my considered
&gt; opinion that no person who would deprive the People of the means to
&gt; self-defense while our streets are rampant with criminal activity
&gt; should assume the mantle of leadership.
&gt; 
&gt; Please veto any and all bills which infringe upon the Second
&gt; Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; 
&gt;           ___________________
