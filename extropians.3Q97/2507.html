<i>&gt; &gt; What the hell are these nanites living on?! </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sun or chemical binding energy, for example.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Their very life requires</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; energy, not to mention, as Anders noted, the cost of trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; concentrate extremely diffuse and oxygen-bonded uranium.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Use dynamite then. But energy wouldn't be a problem.</i><br>
<p>
Yes it is! You are simply assuming energy will not be a problem,<br>
in which case high-energy nano could of course easily wipe out<br>
anything. But in the real world energy *is* a problem; even<br>
building a solar collector system for nanites is non-trivial <br>
and doesn't give that much power. And in the uranium-extraction<br>
scenario discussed here, chemical binding energy is not available<br>
since the materials are already at a very low energy state. <br>
<p>
I have noticed that many people overestimate the power of<br>
nanotech because they forget the energy needs. A good example<br>
is Williams' _Aristoi_. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; And they're not living off of rock.  It's hard to get lower energy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; states than found in a lot of rock without using nuclear processes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That's why aluminum mining is so expensive.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; With nanotech, we might be able to catalyse arbitrary prosesses and </i><br>
<i>&gt; gain energy, as long as there is a net increase in chemical binding </i><br>
<i>&gt; energy.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but rock is mainly oxides and silicates. You can't use it as a<br>
fuel. <br>
<p>
I think there is some confusion here about binding energy etc (no<br>
wonder, I'm not 100% sure about the terminology myself). Just to<br>
get things straight: each molecule has an enthalpy, which is<br>
roughly its "chemical potential". If chemical A and B are transformed<br>
into chemicals C and D, the difference in total enthalpy tells<br>
us how much energy is needed to cause the reaction (if the<br>
difference is negative), or how much energy is released (if the <br>
difference is positive). These are absolute thermodynamic constraints,<br>
in addition energy might be needed to start the reaction, although<br>
this can be lowered using catalysts.<br>
<p>
So the problem here is that the enthalpy of pure uranium or TNT<br>
is high, while the raw materials have a low enthalpy. So you need<br>
a lot of energy to make them, even if your nanotech is good. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; And is the energy state of diamondoid material higher than that of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; organic material?  Probably, in which case this gray goo plague needs</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; constant input or can only grow by processing lots of material -- which</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; means that it grows very slowly.</i><br>
<p>
Could we get some numbers here? What is the average enthalpy of<br>
organic stuff compared to diamond? <br>
<p>
