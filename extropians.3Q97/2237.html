A lifeform is a complex self-organizing system, which keeps entropy<br>
at bay by moving it out from its body through a continous energy flow<br>
(in our case food and air into wastes, plants do it through<br>
sunlight). But it isn't so simple that life appears when entropy<br>
decreases, there are plenty of entropy decreasing but non-living<br>
processes (like freezing a liquid). <br>

IMHO Extropy is a rather loose term, a bit like "complexity". We have<br>
an intuitive feeling for it, but when studied closely it likely falls<br>
apart into some more elementary (and perhaps different) concepts such<br>
as complexity and -entropy. <br>

I think these are very good questions, moving in the borderland<br>
between thermodynamics and complexity theory. But I think we need a<br>
better definition of what we are talking about before proceeding. <br>
