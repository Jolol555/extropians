I agree that, for some people, "optimism" has a Polyanna connotation.<br>
Perhaps adding "dynamic" in front doesn't always avoid that. However, when<br>
I use the term, I *always* explain it and seem to have practically always<br>
thereby prevented misunderstanding. Those who actually read the essay<br>
generally like the term.<br>
<p>
The term "realist" is open to the same problems. I've met many people who<br>
like to think of themselves as realists. Sometimes these people dislike<br>
optimism. I've found that sometimes this is because they think like<br>
pessimists, defeatists, or fatalists, and *believe* that is realistic!<br>
Others who call themselves realists actually think dynamically<br>
optimistically. They see realism as involving the virtues of dynamic<br>
optimism. They just don't call it that. "Realist" to me, often evokes the<br>
image of someone who believes they think clearly and reasonably when they<br>
really want to label their perhaps unrealistic biases "realism".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When I read "dynamic optimism", I think of my last CEO, who always believed</i><br>
<i>&gt;the company would start making pots of money "next year" (it still hasn't).</i><br>
<i>&gt; His optimism (here in the wishful thinking sense) certainly dynamically</i><br>

<p>
Okay, so for you the term (without having read what I wrote about it)<br>
evokes that image. I don't know the details of your ex-CEO, so I don't know<br>
whether he is being dynamically optimistic and has a decent change of<br>
making a breakthrough, or whether he's deluding himself. It's a difficult<br>
question that I address in the essay. After all, you might have gone up to<br>
Edison after his first hundred attempts to build a lightbulb and said:<br>
"Edison, old buddy, be realistic. You've tried this a hundred times and<br>
it's obviously not working. Give it up."<br>
