In a message dated 97-09-11 13:57:16 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you insist on subjectivism, we can argue no further, for I refuse</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to sacrifice the power of my mind to failed philosophies.</i><br>
<p>
Sacrificing  - er what? <br>
You are assuming an argument that I did not make. I have no need for<br>
"ism-ism" Subjective - an internal processing of the "objective" world - is<br>
and continues to be - a state of mind, internally generated, which -<br>
obviously, reality is not. Objectiv-"ism" is  a useful tool for me, not<br>
something I feel compelled to cram into every conversation.<br>
As with poverty and  other things, subjective experience does exist,with or<br>
without your affinity, your affection or your approval.<br>
To be truly objective one must acknowledge it's impact.<br>
There is always an inner side to perception. Call it psychological noise, if<br>
you like. One can debate over if it is real, but one can not intelligently<br>
erase it or concede all have the same "life" experience. Is the world same<br>
for everyone, regardless of perception? Does a blind man "see" the same as I<br>
do? He may percieve things far beyond my grasp, for all I know. <br>
<p>
Oh by the way, you are chasing your tail if you want to prove that reality IS<br>
a reality. It is axiomatic, immutable.<br>
I in NO way suggested that there is "no reality" that exists outside of<br>
physical laws of nature, or that our mind creates our experience by magick -<br>
which is the current meaning of the term "subjectivism" . <br>
