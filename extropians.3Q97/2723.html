This morning I began Carl Sagan's compelling book, _The Demon-Haunted World<br>
- Science As A Candle In The Dark_,  while listening to Vivaldi (Les Quatre<br>
Saisons) in the background.  Somehow the music and the words meshed<br>
enthusiastically.<br>
<p>
Then I remembered a special moment:  Several years ago, while attending the<br>
SETI Conference, I spent a little time with Sagan at a specially organized<br>
afternoon project with some of the children who attended.  We enticed the<br>
children to ask questions about science and space. Mind you, some of the<br>
children were quite young, so we had to help them along with their<br>
questions.  Others were enthusiastically waving their hands asking the<br>
simplest to the most peculiar questions. Carl Sagan answered each one with<br>
concentration and care, ensuring that each child fell included and vital.<br>
<p>
"How can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly<br>
technology-driven lives if we don't understand the difference between the<br>
myths of pseudoscience, New Age thinking, and fundamentalist zealotry and<br>
the testable hypotheses of science?<br>
<p>
"Casting a wide net through history and culture, Sagan examines and<br>
authoritatively debunks ...    As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence,<br>
the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous<br>
plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms."<br>
<p>
Enjoy!<br>
