The whole debate of UFO's generally misses the important question, and The <br>
Question is not 'Have we been visited by an extraterrestrial civilization?' <br>
but 'Why have we been visited by extraterrestrial civilizations?'  I find <br>
debunkers amusing in the fact that they seem so dedicated to disproving <br>
something akin to spending your life trying to disprove the existence of <br>
'God'.  'We' send out probes to other planets...why wouldn't another <br>
planet's intelligent life?  Believe it or don't, but do not worry about it <br>
until the fanatic believers get enough political power to start passing and <br>
enforcing laws that affect your life (as religious fanatics do).<br>
<p>
First, the Air Force's 'mogul' explanation's biggest problem for me is the <br>
amount of material found (supposedly scattered for over a quarter of a <br>
mile).  I've seen photo's of the 'mogul' balloons and 'there just ain't <br>
enough stuff there to be noticeable' for that area (especially after being <br>
blown around in a thunderstorm).  The largest component by far is the <br>
balloon itself.  Even the ranch hand would know balloon material was not <br>
some 'unknown' metallic structure.  The Air Force personnel certainly <br>
would.<br>
<p>
Second, the Air Force has yet to explain the extreme security measures it <br>
took to recover and dispose of this 'balloon'.  Even if it was a top secret <br>
spy device a simple gathering of the wreckage of a 'weather balloon' and an <br>
embarrassing apology for releasing a false report ('We have recovered a <br>
flying saucer') would have sufficed.  Besides, if it WAS a top secret <br>
spying device why wasn't the Air Force actively searching for it?<br>
<p>
Third,  if the 'cover up' was an attempt to scare the Soviet Union into <br>
believing we DID have a 'flying saucer' and could use the recovered <br>
technology to blow them off the face of the earth then THAT should be the <br>
explanation.  Reagan's SDI project has already been admitted as such for <br>
the most part.  But then, that explanation WOULD be an admittance of 'We <br>
planted the material there' and 'Yes Virginia, the Government DOES lie to <br>
you...'.<br>
<p>
Fourth.  Now to 'Why?'.  I can currently think of 4 reasons.<br>
<p>
a)  Pure curiosity.<br>
b)  Economics.<br>
c)  Security.<br>
d)  Survival.<br>
<p>
Both a and b pose no threat to us.  c has the consequences of either 'THEY <br>
would try and sabotage our technology so we could not threaten THEM' or <br>
'THEY want to help us advance and become allies against some third party <br>
civilization ('This Island Earth', written in the 1950's covered this.  The <br>
movie was a joke...read the book.  Jack McDevitt's 'The Engines of God' has <br>
another interesting concept.).  d is double edged too.  THEY could be <br>
looking for suitable new colony locations or just for a 'lifeboat' planet <br>
in an emergency.<br>
<p>
The abduction claims are much harder for me to believe.  These 'aliens' <br>
want to go unnoticed so they take 'specimens' and 'torture' them and <br>
release them back into the pack.  Though an alien thought process may <br>
conceive of this as logical, I sure don't.<br>
<p>
One last thing to ponder.  HOW?  I don't think we currently have the <br>
technology or knowledge to grasp this.  I am of the belief that travel <br>
between solar systems will require a mastery of the Unified Field. <br>
 Something along the line of being able to use AND control gravity to fold <br>
time and space.<br>
<p>
Just scrambled thoughts while trying to wake up.<br>
