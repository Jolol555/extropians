re: Comic Books with extropian themes.<br>
<p>
"V for Vendetta", a graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd<br>
<p>
A lone man, who's face remains unseen behind a Guy Fawkes mask<br>
throughout the graphic novel and who's identity is never revealed,<br>
fights a well coordinated battle to bring down a fascist government in<br>
an alternate history late 1980s England. His goal: to replace the<br>
fascists with ... nothing.<br>
<p>
One of the finest and most moving literary efforts I've ever seen --<br>
whether in or out of the graphic novel medium. Portions *literally*<br>
brought me close to crying, and I could not put it down. I don't know<br>
how to recommend something more highly. The politics (to the extent<br>
that they are spelled out) are also 100% anarcholibertarian correct,<br>
but thats almost secondary. When I compare V to the very poor efforts<br>
Ayn Rand made to produce high literature that incorporated political<br>
themes (in which both the literature and the themes suffered), "V"<br>
compares extraordinarily well.<br>
