Saying you'd "rather be dead than not free" and saying you "would except the<br>
risk of death to fight for freedom" are two very seperate things.  Your view<br>
is obviously optimistic (in that you are risking death for freedom), the<br>
other is pessimistic (accepting death because you cannot see a chance for<br>
freedom).<br>
<p>
Personally, I think death and *no chance of freedom* are the same thing.<br>
