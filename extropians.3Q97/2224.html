Ah, serious confusion here. Indeed, to our perception, the Mandelbrot<br>
Set is infinitely complex, in its overwhelming amount of detail. In<br>
terms of complexity theory, the Mandelbrot Set is a simple object. The<br>
mathematical definition of complexity is basically the length of the<br>
string describing the algorithm used to create the object. The Peano<br>
Postulates describes the algorithm used to create the integers. The<br>
algorithm used for the Mandelbrot Set is only slightly longer. Both<br>
objects are not very complex in this sense. A grape is much more<br>
complex, simply due to the length of the active DNA used to build a<br>
grape.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But is complexity really the issue here?  You seem to be saying that</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Mandelbrot Set is not real because it's not complex enough, Hara was</i><br>
<i>&gt; saying it's not real because it's too complex.</i><br>
<p>
Let me make a slight modification to my terminology:<br>
<p>
	Areal - Abstractly Real, ie, Platonic reality<br>
	Preal - Physically Real, representable in the physical universe<br>
	Mreal - Mentally Real, representable in the mind<br>
<p>
Mreal is a subset of Preal. Preal is a subset of Areal.<br>
<p>
The set of integers, and the Mandelbrot Set are Areal objects. Said sets<br>
cannot be represented in the Preal or Mreal. The definitions or<br>
algorithms for these objects are Mreal, and therefore Preal. The<br>
definitions are not complex, and the sets themselves are.<br>
<p>
BTW, to all readers of this list, Hara Ra is a single word, ie, <br>
Hara(space)Ra. (I would use Hara_Ra but my email server won't accept<br>
underscores)<br>
