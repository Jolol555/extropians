Obviously, if I can crack a crack ghetto without obsoleting any medical<br>
procedures, i will.  I just don't think I can.  And while opiates such as<br>
morphine might well have medical uses that would outweigh even the necessity<br>
of busting the ghetto, I think that the eye surgeons could probably use<br>
something synthetic.  Or you could keep a bit of cocaine in sealed greenhouses<br>
to use for eye surgery; I'm sure that some druglords would have sealed<br>
greenhouses anyway.<br>
<p>
Even if cocaine comes back after a while, it's okay as long as (1) the brief<br>
hiatus has busted up the ghetto and gotten everyone unaddicted, and (2)<br>
cocaine is legalized so we don't go all through this again.<br>
<p>
The government made all these drugs illegal, which was a major mistake.  Now<br>
we have to repair the damage.  If that requires coercive force... well,<br>
problems created by violence often require violence to solve.  We would be<br>
quite fortunate to get away with so little as a non-coercive force-evolved<br>
virus to repair so long a history of law and repression.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Destroy the plants, and you destroy not only their evil uses, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; their good ones, and the good uses of any other plant that might</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolve from or be bred from it.</i><br>
<p>
If the government steals your home and gives it to some innocent fellow, and<br>
then a Libertarian government gets voted in, can you use coercive force to<br>
deprive this innocent fellow of his home?  The most merciful way to do it<br>
would be to knock him unconscious and transport him elsewhere.  That way, at<br>
least he doesn't have to become a criminal just for defending his home. <br>
Target his location, not him.<br>
<p>
My point here is that the government screwed up, and now the doctors have to<br>
pay.  Some injustice is inevitable; the problem is minimizing it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That some uses of a resource destroy people's live is undeniable</i><br>
<i>&gt; and unfortunate, but the resource itself is the wrong place to put</i><br>
<i>&gt; the blame.</i><br>
<p>
What would you do, bearing in mind that it has to work?  Drug legalization is<br>
all very well, but what if the crack ghettos are still there?<br>
