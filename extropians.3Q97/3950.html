I'm sure many organizations will provide similar services, but not on a<br>
volunteer basis (if by volunteer you mean free-of-charge), since these<br>
organizations will be extremely attractive targets for subversion and must<br>
have sufficient resources to defend themselves. Altruistic and wealthy<br>
individuals might offer these services as community service, but I don't<br>
see how they can convince people of their trustworthiness. <br>
<p>
I would suggest avoiding free "truth maintenance services" if they are<br>
ever offered unless you are really poor, because they'll most likely be<br>
potential sources of disinformation and subversion. <br>
<p>
One way to defend against or at least detect large scale disinformation<br>
efforts might to make periodic personal backups of randomly chosen<br>
Internet sites and to constantly cross-check them against the real-time<br>
Internet for consistency. Possibly security organizations will give away<br>
daily indices of global Internet consistency as advertisement.<br>
