Will someone more conversant in technical French please let me know if <br>
"la brisure" is anything other than "the discontinuity"? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;some kind. I am attempting to understand it myself. Yet, I do know that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the break(la brisure) is absolutely essential as an axiomatic of</i><br>
<i>&gt;capitalism,</i><br>
<p>
I can't quite fathom this. I thought I understood capitalism fairly well, <br>
but perhaps an axiom has escaped me... as the "category notion" is/was<br>
axiomatic but unnoticed in philosophy for millennia.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and that it operates from within dialogues such as these,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and</i><br>
<i>&gt;also from within larger social contexts, and is not necessarily "the</i><br>
<i>&gt;pause that refreshes." This concept is closely akin to another: that</i><br>
<i>&gt;surplus value cannot be determined mathematically.&lt;Nomadthought@usa.net&gt;</i><br>
<p>
(perplexity) One can argue that *value* cannot be determined mathematically.<br>
Many have. I don't want to accuse you of dazzlement, but I hope you <br>
won't mind "unpacking" your speech a bit. A discontinuity takes place <br>
across a zero (or arbitrarily small) interval; I see nothing "pause"-like<br>
about it unless you "cheat" and swap axes. But maybe "brisure" isn't <br>
"discontinuity". I'm also completely unfamiliar with whatever connotative<br>
baggage "brisure" carries with it in French...<br>
