Dear fellow Extropians,<br>
The alternative to corporate structures as a form of organization is<br>
possibly a cooperative, integrated and interactive worker owned<br>
environment, At issue would be the surrounding political environment. <br>
It seems that among the many questions that would have to be asked is<br>
whether in a highly competetive world economy large numbers of such<br>
organizations can compete effectively when all the variables and<br>
constraints in a multicultural world are taken into account. <br>
I have my own theories, but I'd like to know what the rest of you think.<br>
It would be nice to have a few realistic and implimentable proposals as<br>
responses.<br>
Enjoy,<br>
AMG  <br>
