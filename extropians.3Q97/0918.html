That is deeply a matter of opinon.  I happen to enjoy my computer, my <br>
smart drugs, and our expanding perceptual/conceptual universe via Space <br>
Telescopes and Nanoprobes.  However, I do NOT enjoy having to work 40+ <br>
hours to maintain it.  Although my job is quite interesting and <br>
enjoyable for the most part, I would rather be spending more of my time <br>
in liesure pursuits. Obviously tribal cultures have not advanced their <br>
postion, but they have no impelling reason to do so when the majority of <br>
their time is spent having sex and fun.<br>
<p>
The reason I'm not droping my clothes and running to the rain forest is <br>
because I basically agree with you as to the process of maximizing ones <br>
extropy.  However if work is the be all and end all of our extropic <br>
pursuits, we need a serious re-assement!  I for one, plan on taking my <br>
nanotechnoligcal self(s) into the farest reaches of the cosmos in seach <br>
of the biggest parties I can find!<br>
<p>
My future is maximum fun, minimum work!  I work hard only as is <br>
necessary to increase my extropy and no more.  I plan on surving the end <br>
of whatever happens to this universe - not so I have to work more, but <br>
work less.  I plan on tweaking the physical constants as much as <br>
possible, to ensure that whatever basement universes I create will <br>
maximize fun, minimize work/fuss.<br>
<p>
If it wasn't for the tribal cultures I've spent time with, and the <br>
psychedelics I have imbibed, I don't think I would appreacite the subtle <br>
point I am trying to get across here.  Its the difference between a <br>
computer artist and their tools.  As a computer artist you are in the <br>
conudrum of having to *balance* your time between keeping up with the <br>
latest tools of the trade and actually creating something with them.  <br>
Balance is the key word here. Tribal cultures have a lot to teach us <br>
about balance.  That is my opinion.<br>
<p>
Warm Regards,<br>
