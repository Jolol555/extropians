In a message dated 97-07-16 17:21:39 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  I would regard a third world shepherd as a leaver, a western world <br>
      rancher as a taker. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
I've seen "third world" grazing operations...if you can call Crete,Greece<br>
third world.  I'm from Texas originally....and travel the West frequently.<br>
  Ours is better.<br>
<p>
With this said I must disagree vigorously with my understanding of your<br>
premise that west=bad.....(exploitive ...etc.....)....Third World =<br>
good...noble savages...poor exploited victims...etc.  If i misunderstand I<br>
apoligize...but for all our warts...western culture (culture in this instance<br>
meaning society/technology/civilization) is much superior to anything else<br>
yet encountered.IMHO<br>
<p>
I may read the one about the gorilla...although "Telepathy" rates right up<br>
there on my list of hot buttons as "Time Travel, Telekineses, Claravoyence,<br>
FTL, same generation "mutations"...etc...etc...<br>
<p>
But all that aside...his " Takers "and the "Takers" I refer to are similar<br>
but different...<br>
 <br>
a thumbnail description:<br>
<p>
A Maker ... provides (produces...creates) goods or services. which can be<br>
bartered         and traded in a free-market (or not so free)...note: all<br>
goods and services may not be "legal"...see below.<br>
<p>
A Taker ... takes...thru force or threat of force....i.e. governments and<br>
other theives<br>
<p>
A Faker.....takes....thru fraud and chichanery...misrepresentation...i.e.<br>
relegions..enviromental wackos..the Politically Correct...and other<br>
charlatans..<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
I'm sure there is ovelap...I'm sure this is simplistic....but it works for<br>
me.<br>
