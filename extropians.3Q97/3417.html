<p>
That seems reasonable, to say that the standard of living has been raised.<br>
<p>
I don't think "poor" is generally used to mean exactly what you said.<br>
Or, rather, the definition of what constitutes proper shelter, medical<br>
care, and adequate food changes over time.  Many people in the U.S. who<br>
would generally be considered "poor" get enough food, but it may not be<br>
as healthy or varied a diet as for wealthier people.  Likewise a "poor"<br>
person could have shelter and medical care that is better than what is<br>
available to most of the third world, but is not nearly as nice as what<br>
the middle class has available in the West.<br>
<p>
The point is that being poor is relative.  No doubt you are right that<br>
a poor person finds this cold comfort.<br>
<p>
Presumably, in the future, people with standards of living even higher<br>
than our own will still be considered "poor", with just as much pity<br>
and concern directed towards their miserable living conditions as we<br>
feel towards today's poor.  The poor of the future won't care that their<br>
immortality and full-sense virtual reality give them lives of a quality<br>
which even the richest people today can only dream of.  They will look<br>
with envy at the vast estates and human servants which only the rich<br>
can afford (the poor being stuck with virtual estates and robot slaves).<br>
<p>
Can you imagine someone with such physical riches feeling just as<br>
oppressed, deprived, and downtrodden as the poorest of the poor do today?<br>
Should we say that their feelings are justified?<br>
<p>
We are a competitive species.  We tend to measure our well being not<br>
in absolute terms, but relative to other people, or relative to how we<br>
were in the past or will be in the future.  Game theory experiments have<br>
shown that people tend to go for outcomes which improve their standing<br>
compared to other players, rather than those which maximize their own<br>
personal expected gains.  Presumably this is a heuristic which has been<br>
successful in making choices in the past.  If you can do better than the<br>
guy in the next cave, you're doing pretty well.<br>
<p>
But as a result, as long as there are differences in outcomes, there<br>
will be those who feel unhappy that other people are doing better than<br>
themselves.  Jesus Christ himself said "the poor you will always have<br>
with you", and for once, I agree with him.<br>
