Cows have a long gestation period, 10 months, but the Aug 8 New York Times <br>
says 10 cows cloned from adult cows are on the verge of being born. The <br>
Holstein cows were made by an American company in Wisconsin, ABS Global Inc. <br>
Although no animal has been born yet it could just be a matter of days, <br>
everybody seems healthy and apparently in cattle if you don't have a <br>
miscarriage in the first 90 days the calf will probably be OK. <br>
<p>
In the original sheep cloning only one try in 277 was successful, but ABS has <br>
improved the procedure and has a much higher success rate, half the tries <br>
resulted in an embryo and 80% of those made it past the critical 90 day mark. <br>
The ABS improvement was in adding an extra step, they took the nucleus of a <br>
cell from an animal they wanted to clone and placed it in an egg without a <br>
nucleus and let it divide a few times, BUT then they removed one of those <br>
cells and used it to clone the animal.<br>
<p>
This should remove the fears, or hopes, of some that the original sheep <br>
cloning was one in a million and they just got lucky, or that no other animal <br>
would be as easy to clone as a sheep, or that a human would never be cloned  <br>
because the procedure was too inefficient.<br>
