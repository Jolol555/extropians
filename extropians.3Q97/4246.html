Jimm Legg, already an Extropian as far as I know,<br>
and owner of the above website, expressed an interest<br>
in the NSPIC debate, so I asked him to participate.<br>
<p>
I don't understand what he's doing with NSPIC on<br>
his website, nor why he's doing it.  I got the<br>
impression -- perhaps misguided on my part --<br>
that he thinks he already knows all the elements<br>
of NSPIC and has written them on his website.<br>
But I couldn't find there even one of the elements<br>
I think I've identified.<br>
