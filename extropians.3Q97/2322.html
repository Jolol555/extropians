Len Flatley:<br>
<i>&gt;	i guess an "extropian viewpoint" on child rearing would be:</i><br>
<i>&gt;	children are influenced, molded by their surroundings. why</i><br>
<i>&gt;	would you subject your children to any system (public school, </i><br>
<i>&gt;	catholic school, hebrew school, the rotary club, the marine </i><br>
<i>&gt;	corps) that is anathema to Extropy?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I will grant that school environments do create opportunity for <br>
bullies and the weak-minded to prey on children unlike themselves, <br>
and I do not doubt that most of the persons on this list had some bad <br>
experiences during their school years.  I do not agree, however, <br>
that spending time in a potentially environment discourages personal and <br>
intellectual growth.  One of the main cautions for parents <br>
considering home-schooling is that their children must somehow be <br>
exposed to situations in which they must negotiate disputes with <br>
other children, and learn to assert themselves, without the <br>
intervention of adults (unless the situation becomes dangerous).  <br>
Socialization theory holds that this aspect of early development <br>
partially determines future effectiveness in a career or personal <br>
relationships.  <br>
<p>
That's the theoretical level.  On a practical level, humans who are <br>
different in a manner that is going to draw hostility from other <br>
humans need to learn to deal with it early in life.  Developing the <br>
quality of courage, based on the success of prior experiences of <br>
standing one's ground, will help prevent some of the future <br>
potential incidents.  And, in addition, that strength will carry into <br>
other areas of life and allow that person to face future adversities <br>
more successfully.<br>
