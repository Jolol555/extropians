With this message I'm launching a debate on NSPIC.<br>
NSPIC =3D Neuro-Semantic Political Illusion Complex.<br>
Later in this message I give a brief description<br>
of what I mean by NSPIC.<br>
<p>
NSPIC could be regarded as an extension of many<br>
of the ideas expressed in the article "Deep<br>
Anarchy" by Max More -- Extropy magazine #5,<br>
Winter, 1990.  "Deep Anarchy" is available at:<br>
<p>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm</a>&gt;<br>
<p>
(Please use this article as an example to buy<br>
back issues of Extropy magazine -- info at=20<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.extropy.com/~exi/extback.htm">http://www.extropy.com/~exi/extback.htm</a>&gt;.)<br>
<p>
My reason for wanting to conduct this debate<br>
with other extropians is that I presume that<br>
among extropians there are many thinkers pretty<br>
advanced in their ability to question and<br>
challenge what most people would regard as<br>
incontestably "beyond question."<br>
<p>
But first some background.  In the early seventies<br>
I read Lysander Spooner's 'No Treason: The Constitution<br>
of No Authority.'  Spooner argued that the pretended<br>
"US Constitution" was never signed or adopted by<br>
anyone in a manner that would make it a legal or valid<br>
contract.  He was an attorney and argued convincingly<br>
that the pretended "Constitution" was really a scam<br>
that was never legally binding on anyone.  Hence the<br>
supposed "US Government" was a sham and those pretending<br>
to act as "government officials" authorized by the<br>
pretended "Constitution" were imposters and liars.<br>
He extended this argument to apply to all other<br>
pretended "countries."<br>
<p>
Later I read Nietzsche and Stirner.  I was particularly<br>
impressed by Stirner's principle of going beyond just<br>
challenging God/authority/government/law, and challenging<br>
the very *idea* of "God"/"authority"/"government"/"law."<br>
<p>
I also read Robert Ringer's 'Restoring the American<br>
Dream,' Chapter 8 titled "Keeping It All in Place,"<br>
where he argues that the political system is kept<br>
in place by certain words, including "government"<br>
and "country."<br>
<p>
I was also influenced by Jeremy Bentham ('Bentham's<br>
Theory of Fictions' by C.K. Ogden), Hans Vaihinger<br>
('The Philosophy of As If'), Orwell ('1984'), Alfred<br>
Korzybski (General Semantics), Gustav le Bon ('The<br>
Crowd'), Rose Wilder Lane ('The Discovery of Freedom'),<br>
Harry Browne ('How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World'),<br>
and quite a few others.<br>
<p>
After considerable thinking, reading, discussing,<br>
writing, and debating, I eventually came to the<br>
conclusion that political systems are kept in<br>
place at the deepest and most fundamental level<br>
by a number of illusions and the unwitting use<br>
of words that hide and perpetuate these illusions.<br>
(There are also some other importanr basic factors<br>
that contribute to the perpetuation of political<br>
systems.)<br>
<p>
Most humans, including many libertarians and<br>
anarchists, suffer from these illusions and at<br>
the deepest level help to perpetuate political<br>
systems by the unwitting ways they use certain<br>
political words -- they help spread and reinforce<br>
the basic political memes which form part of the<br>
bedrock of statism.<br>
<p>
In the last few days I decided to call this<br>
combination of illusions and words that, in my<br>
opinion, constitute a major part of the bedrock<br>
of statism, the "Neuro-Semantic Political<br>
Illusion Complex" or "NSPIC."<br>
<p>
My experiences with the ideas of "Deep Anarchy"<br>
and NSPIC over several years have led me to<br>
realize that I need expert assistance to further<br>
develop these ideas and any practical implementations<br>
that may result from them.  That's why I'm launching<br>
this debate with other extropians. The debate could<br>
have several purposes:<br>
<p>
1. Improve the formulation of NSPIC.<br>
<p>
2. Identify all the elements of NSPIC.<br>
<p>
3. Identify the barriers to understanding NSPIC.<br>
<p>
4. Identify the thinking skills or mental<br>
mechanisms individuals need to have or develop<br>
in order to understand and transcend NSPIC.<br>
<p>
5. Outline the benefits individuals may gain<br>
from understanding and transcending NSPIC.<br>
<p>
6. Identify a series of steps individuals can<br>
take to systematically gain an undestanding of<br>
and transcend NSPIC.<br>
<p>
7. Develop the means to communicate about NSPIC<br>
to extropians, libertarians, anarchists, and other<br>
freedom lovers in a manner that will lead them<br>
to make an effort to understand and transcend<br>
NSPIC.<br>
<p>
At some point the debate could be extended to<br>
cover any other factors that may constitute part<br>
of the bedrock of statism.  We could think of<br>
NSPIC together with the other factors as the<br>
*causes of statism* or the *factors that perpetuate<br>
political systems*.<br>
<p>
What I hope to achieve with this debate is the<br>
eventual creation of an informal unorganized<br>
network of freedom activists who have an<br>
advanced understanding of the phenomenon of<br>
statism.  I expect that this advanced understanding<br>
will eventually lead to more powerful and effective<br>
freedom strategies being practiced by a steadily<br>
growing number of advanced freedom activists.<br>
<p>
This message is posted in the spirit of seeking<br>
expert assistance.  I think I'm in the early stages<br>
of developing a major breakthrough in how to think<br>
about and act in relation to political systems, but<br>
so far I've only been able to communicate effectively<br>
about NSPIC to a handful of people.  With expert<br>
assistance... who knows what we individuals can<br>
achieve?<br>

all the other threads I suggest we always put NSPIC<br>
in the subject.]<br>

<p>
I have used variations of the above as well as the<br>
message below to promote the NSPIC debate to people<br>
on a few other lists, and I've invited them to subscribe<br>
to the extropy list.<br>
<p>
Following are some early responses to my initial<br>
announcement of the debate, and my replies.<br>

<i>&gt;"I've really enjoyed your articles.  The three TL reports I mentioned</i><br>

<i>&gt;to add anything to the discussion but hope to be further enlightened!"</i><br>

<i>&gt;"Your  post is intriguing.  You articulate something I have tried to</i><br>
<i>&gt;express, but have never been quite able to put into words: the idea</i><br>
<i>&gt;that all governments are somehow "bootstrapped" into existence.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'll try to contribute to this."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;JD</i><br>
<p>
You've already contributed more than you may<br>
realize!  The notion "bootstrapped into existence"<br>
is extremely important.  I expect that this will<br>
become an important theme of the debate.<br>
<p>
Once we understand just what it is that was<br>
really bootstrapped into existence, and the<br>
elements used to perform the bootstrap, we'll<br>
understand better how to do the "unbootstrapping."<br>
<p>
JD, I look forward to your participation in the<br>
debate!<br>

<i>&gt;"I don't know if this has anything to do directly with NSPIC, but what I=</i><br>
 find<br>
<i>&gt;really amazing is how people treat me now as how they treated me=</i><br>
 twenty-five<br>
<i>&gt;years ago.  For example, if I want to eat sweets and breakfast cereals for=</i><br>
 my<br>
<i>&gt;evening meal, I am free to do so.  If I wanted to do the same thing</i><br>
<i>&gt;twenty-five years ago, it would have come to physical violence and some=</i><br>
 very<br>
<i>&gt;nasty arguments.  It never ceases to amaze me how people treat me different</i><br>
<i>&gt;than they did a long time ago because they perceive me differently.</i><br>

<p>
I'm sure you'll be able to contribute a great<br>
deal because you've followed a largely experiential<br>
path to overcoming NSPIC, whereas the rest of us,<br>
who've made some progress in transcending NSPIC,<br>
have followed largely intellectual paths.<br>
<p>
Let me tell you why your experience above may be<br>
related to NSPIC.  I'll jump the gun on the debate<br>
by suggesting that what's really "bootstrapped into<br>
existence" may be *thought/communication/behavior<br>
patterns of domination/subjugation/exploitation,<br>
contributed to and perpetuated by both tyrants and<br>
victims*.<br>
<p>
In transcending NSPIC to the degree that you have,<br>
you've risen above thought/communication/behavior<br>
patterns of domination/subjugation/exploitation.<br>
Not only do people perceive you differently because<br>
of this, you also perceive them differently.  You're<br>
not a victim and they're not tyrants.  In a sense,<br>
you've "unbootstrapped" yourself from thought/<br>
communication/behavior patterns of domination/<br>
subjugation/exploitation!<br>

<i>&gt;"The insight that habits of expression/thought perpetuate the cancer</i><br>
<i>&gt;which is external govt strikes me as both true &amp; crucial.  I think we</i><br>
<i>&gt;need to look at the concept very closely; if we don't free ourselves</i><br>
<i>&gt;first of all, where's freedom going to come from?  But I'd caution,</i><br>
<i>&gt;however, against allowing the discussion to get bogged down either in</i><br>
<i>&gt;jargon or indeed verbiage of any type."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Victor Mil=E1n  &lt;vicmilan@ix.netcom.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
According to Robert Pirsig in 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance':<br>
"But to tear down a factory or to revolt against a government or to avoid<br>
repairs of a motorcycle because it is a system is to attack effects rather<br>
than causes; and as long as the attack is upon effects only, no change is<br>
possible.  The true system, the real system, is our present *construction<br>
of systematic thought* itself, *rationality* itself.  And if a factory is<br>
torn down but the rationality which produced it is left standing, then<br>
that rationality will simply produce another factory.  If a revolution<br>
destroys a systematic government, but the systematic patterns of thought<br>
that produced that government are left intact, then those patterns will<br>
repeat themselves in the succeeding government..."  [emphasis added]<br>
<p>
During the NSPIC debate we'll explore the systematic<br>
patterns of thought/expression/behavior that keep<br>
political systems in place.  We'll discover that<br>
certain expressions are memes that tend to empower<br>
tyrants while tending to disempower victims.  We'll<br>
have to develop powerful new memes to knock out old<br>
harmful memes, as indicated by Don Tiggre below.<br>
<p>
Some of the new memes, being new expressions/concepts/<br>
words, will be jargon.  The debate will almost certainly<br>
generate enormous verbiage.  Some people may get<br>
bogged down.  I'm reasonably confident that we will<br>
be able to continue the debate to the point that we<br>
produce worthwhile results.<br>
<p>
I think you hit the nail on the head when you say,<br>
"if we don't free ourselves first of all, where's<br>
freedom going to come from?"  I expect that during<br>
the debate we'll learn a great deal about just what<br>
we need to free ourselves from, how we might go about<br>
freeing ourselves from these things, and how we could<br>
learn to persuade others to also free themselves from<br>
these things.<br>
<p>
Victor, I hope you'll participate in the debate.<br>

<i>&gt;"The circulation of powerful memes that can knock out old harmful</i><br>
<i>&gt;ones is central to what LRT is all about, and an idea Mr. Mann has</i><br>
<i>&gt;espoused for some time."</i><br>

<i>&gt;Don L. Tiggre &lt;don-tiggre@utah-inter.net&gt;</i><br>
<p>
[LRT =3D Liberty Round Table -- see <a href="http://home.lrt.org">http://home.lrt.org</a> ]<br>
<p>
Consider the possibility that without certain memes<br>
(words), political tyrants would be powerless.  If<br>
so, then if we can succeed in knocking out the old<br>
harmful memes, the terrocrats (terrorist bureaucrats<br>
or coercive political agents) would be history.<br>
Maybe the time will come when they can be laughed<br>
out of power!  (But before this can happen, we'll<br>
have to make a great deal of progress in countering<br>
all the other factors that keep statism in place.)<br>
<p>
Don, I hope you'll participate in the debate.<br>

<i>&gt;"The NSPIC announcement sent to this list earlier sounds intriguing!</i><br>
<i>&gt;I've SUBSCRIBEd to explore the topic(s).  It definitely shows promise</i><br>
<i>&gt;in seeking the "roots" of HUMAN PARADIGMS!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;... Ergo, the construction of human systems to fill the void:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Collectivist-Statist-Fascism with its collateral fantasies of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Royalty (e.g., Di... Oops! Almost!! &lt;g&gt;).</i><br>

Maybe the debate will bring together some properly<br>
deprogrammed, and then well-reprogrammed, necktop<br>
computers who will, in effect, form a parallel-<br>
processing mega-brain of such stupendous power<br>
that we'll be able to out-think the brilliant<br>

us -- even demoralized some of us -- with 95% of<br>
their brains in neutral! &lt;g&gt;<br>

<i>&gt;"I'm no expert, but I do have days where I feel as if political systems</i><br>
can be<br>
<i>&gt;toppled with just a push from my index finger.  I feel as if I can get my</i><br>
<i>&gt;arms around this problem, but it is just out of reach.  I do feel as if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;answers are very close."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;UW</i><br>
<p>
To topple political systems it may help to identify<br>
and debate *all* the factors that hold them in place.<br>
Then we need to implement strategies in respect of<br>
each factor.  I expect that major breaktrhough answers<br>
will emerge from the process of the debate.<br>
<p>
In my opinion, the neuro-semantic factor is one of<br>
the most important.  At the neuro-semantic level<br>
most freedom activists actually support political<br>
systems because they share the fundamental political<br>
illusions and they use, reinforce, and spread the<br>
basic words (memes) on which the fundamental power<br>
of the tyrants depends.<br>
<p>
The primary weapon tyrants use to control and keep<br>
their victims in subjugation and exploit them is<br>
*words*.  They use *words* far more than guns.  No<br>
terrocrat has ever used or threatened to use a gun<br>
against me.  They've used only words against me.<br>
<p>
That I stopped buying into the terrocrats' word<br>
game 25 years ago, and relieved myself of the<br>
basic political illusions, have much to do with<br>
why it's been possible for me to live effectively<br>
free from political systems for 25 years.<br>
<p>
The intention of the debate is to eventually cover<br>
not only the neuro-semantic factor, but all the<br>
others as well.  As a result of the debate we'll<br>
gain a better understanding of all the factors<br>
that keep political systems in place.  We'll also<br>
learn what steps individuals have to go through<br>
in order to understand all the factors.  And<br>
we'll learn how to commmunicate effectively about<br>
all this.<br>
<p>
Sometimes a huge problem is like a massive rock,<br>
apparently solid and immovable.  The very idea of<br>
getting our arms around it seems a pipedream.<br>
<p>
Think of this massive rock as, in a state of balance,<br>
resting on a number of pinnacles (each pinnacle being<br>
one of the factors causing statism).  Maybe, prior<br>
to this debate, most freedom activists have attacked<br>
the rock -- but in ways that have actually strengthened<br>
and reinforced some of the pinnacles.<br>
<p>
Some freedom activists have indeed attacked some of<br>
the pinnacles, but not sufficiently to threaten the<br>
balance of the structure.<br>
<p>
How stable is the structure?  And what happens if<br>
the rock gets too big for its pinnacles?<br>
<p>
(And what if the rock is really a toy balloon?<br>
Remember what Vonnegut said about a granfalloon!)<br>
<p>
Maybe, during the debate, we'll discover some clever<br>
little shoves, pushes, and pricks that might set in<br>
motion a number of self-perpetuating snowballing<br>
processes, that will combine to eventually bring<br>
the entire structure crashing down -- or just pop<br>
it into oblivion!<br>
<p>
Buckminster Fuller has described the "trim-tab<br>
principle."  A huge ship has a large rudder.  At<br>
the back of the large rudder is a small rudder<br>
called the trim tab.  The trim tab moves the<br>
large rudder, which changes the direction of the<br>
huge ship.  Leveraged leverage.  The little push<br>
from your index finger that topples political<br>
systems?<br>
<p>
Wishful thinking?  Who knows?  Let's find out!<br>
