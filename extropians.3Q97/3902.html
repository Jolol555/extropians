I'm not sure this makes sense.  Although paper banknotes didn't have<br>
value in and of themselves, they achieved their value because they can<br>
be exchanged for valuable commodities like gold.  Even fiat currencies<br>
can be used to buy items of value from the government, or to pay debts<br>
to the government.<br>
<p>
If someone issued notes which weren't backed by anything, they wouldn't<br>
be used as money, in my experience.  We tried this a few years ago with<br>
an online electronic cash system called "magic money".  Nobody was willing<br>
to part with anything in exchange for it.  Really, why should they?<br>
<p>
You need backing with a useful, valuable commodity (or service) in order<br>
for something to be accepted as money (or else the money itself needs to<br>
be useful and valuable, like gold has been historically).<br>
<p>
Note that this does not prevent fractional reserve banking; a bank can<br>
issue bank notes for more than the amount of gold it has backing them,<br>
and as long as it does not do this to excess it can still be successful.<br>
