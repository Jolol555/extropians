I've been persuaded by reading Roger Scruton, the conservative<br>
semi-libertarian (or at least very anti-socialist) UK philosopher, that<br>
allowing legal incorporation, allowing a true collective to be holdable<br>
legally accountable, is one of the pillars of civil society.  Now I<br>
don't know the ins and outs of law as it stands, but if companies are<br>
somehow getting away with things because of corporate law as it stands,<br>
that is wrong, because the function of corporate law ought to be to hold<br>
corporations accountable for their actions as a (presumably univocal in<br>
the relevant respects) collective.  It is particularly important that if<br>
we are to have government, at the very least that government must be<br>
subject to the same kind of accountability (of course not through<br>
corporate law but through constitutional law).  That's what was missing<br>
in Soviet Russia for example: the Party was unaccountable in this sort<br>
of way.<br>
