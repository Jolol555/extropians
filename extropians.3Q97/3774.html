<i> &gt; Are most of you, extropians, libertarians?</i><br>
<p>
Well, I'm one.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Why do you think free-markets are the best economical solution?</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what you mean by "best economical solution".  I<br>
just don't think it's a good idea to allow some self-important<br>
people with guns at their beck and call to run around telling<br>
other people what to do.  I guess I got this wacky idea by<br>
reading a lot of history and some price theory and game theory.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; In today's world, it's almost impossible to do something without</i><br>
<i> &gt; affecting other persons, still why do you claim individual freedom</i><br>
<i> &gt; and an almost cult of individual property so important?</i><br>
<p>
Your control of your property is your ability to defend yourself<br>
from the ill effects of other people's actions on you.  (Likewise,<br>
a poor person's control of eir property is eir ability to defend<br>
emself from ill effects of your actions on em.) The "affecting<br>
other persons" that you are talking about is called "externalities"<br>
by economists.  One of them, a man named Coase, proved (if I have<br>
this right) that in a market with minimal transactions costs,<br>
externalities can be resolved by market processes.  Most economic<br>
progress seems to be related to reduction in transactions costs.<br>
Other (non-market) means of resolving externalities generally<br>
require authorities with enforcement powers (i. e. guns); I prefer<br>
voluntary solutions, perhaps as a matter of taste, and Coase has<br>
shown that voluntary solutions can work.  I think Coase won a Nobel<br>
prize for this work.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Complete freedom in economies will bring to the scene big </i><br>
<i> &gt; corporations instead of small, local business.</i><br>
<p>
Really?  I hadn't known there was a proof of this.  But even if<br>
this is the case (and I'm not sure it is) unfreedom in economies<br>
brings to the scene big governments instead of small, local<br>
businesses, so less economic freedom doesn't really solve this<br>
problem.  It just shifts the threat from big corporations to big<br>
governments.  Big corporations at least have the advantage of<br>
usually funding themselves voluntarily, and not usually interfering<br>
with the lives of people they have no contractual relationship<br>
with.  At least when you compare them with governments.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Won't this corporations have too much power and therefore harming</i><br>
<i> &gt; everyone (the consumers and general public) but themselves?</i><br>
<p>
I doubt that they'd have as much power as governments do now,<br>
and governments often harm everyone (the consumers and general<br>
public) but themselves.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Do you think the economy should be based on small business or big</i><br>
<i> &gt; corporations?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think this is a question that can be settled on a<br>
priori grounds.  I think people ought to be allowed to do what<br>
they want as long as they refrain from harming others.  I know<br>
that "harm" is difficult to define, but no more difficult than<br>
trying to decide, in advance, whether or not everyone would be<br>
better off if all busineses were small or if some businesses<br>
were large and impersonal.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; What do you think of environmental issues? Do you think technology</i><br>
<i> &gt; will always give us the solutions to all our problems?</i><br>
<p>
If it won't, then I don't know how governments are going to fix<br>
the environmental problems either.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; What do you think the intervention of government in economy should</i><br>
<i> &gt; be?</i><br>
<p>
Minimal.<br>
