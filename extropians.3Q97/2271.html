The Foresight Exchange on-line betting game (based on Robin Hanson's Idea<br>
Futures) has a betting claim on whether a computer will become the Go<br>
champion before the year 2020.  Current odds are running at about a 60%<br>
chance of it happening by then.  So the consensus of the players would<br>
seem to be that this is not likely to happen soon (since surely the<br>
computers of 2020 will be much more powerful than those of today, plus<br>
progress in AI should give the computers a software edge by then as well).<br>
