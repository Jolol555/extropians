    How many of you would you say that the conversations you have at<br>
many conferences, especially extro conferences, are as valuable or more<br>
valuable than the talks and presentations.<br>
<p>
    I enjoyed the presentations at extro3 a great deal &amp; am very<br>
indebted to the speakers, but I was also constantly running out of time<br>
for the stimulating conversations that I fortunate to take part in.<br>
<p>
   I bet many of you would have enjoyed the chance for more<br>
conversation, but with the packed schedule it is difficult.   How about<br>
some ideas to try to capture more of this value?<br>
<p>
* longer conferences<br>
* more conferences per year, each with fewer speakers and more chances<br>
for structured or unstructured conversation<br>
* higher price for extro conference (I'd gladly pay) + some kind of<br>
"scholarships" for people who are desired as attendees, even if they are<br>
not necessarily speakers<br>
* online list of attendees so you can prepare to have discussions in<br>
advance<br>
<p>
    What do you think? Any other ideas?<br>
<p>
    -Luke<br>
