I'll approach these from the point of view of which would improve the<br>
world the most from my perspective.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1) "Incentive Contracts" (<a href="http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/buyhealth.html">http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/buyhealth.html</a>)</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) "Explaining Product Bans" (<a href="http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/whyban.ps">http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/whyban.ps</a>)</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3) "Why Do We Disagree?" (<a href="http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/calibration.ps">http://hss.caltech/edu/~hanson/calibration.ps</a>)</i><br>
<p>
First, I think (3) is the least pragmatically useful.  The paper was way over<br>
my head, and to the very limited extent I could understand it, it didn't seem<br>
to match the real world.  I don't know whether the problem is that people<br>
aren't rational, or whether their stated reasons for their beliefs don't<br>
match their real ones, or what.  But I doubt that anyone's going to change<br>
how people choose their beliefs.  So it seemed mostly of academic value.<br>
<p>
(1) and (2) are both interesting and suggest possible ways that the world<br>
could improve.  However (1) scares me a little.  If my HMO also issued my<br>
life insurance, it would seem like it was balancing my life vs my death on<br>
strict financial grounds.  Maybe this makes sense economically, but it<br>
gives me a very uncomfortable feeling.  "Sorry, we've decided it's cheaper<br>
just to pay out your life insurance than to cure you.  Have a nice death."<br>
<p>
(2) looks promising.  I think we may well see a climate in which<br>
alternatives to strict government regulation are explored.  The rise of<br>
multinationals, the trans-territorial nature of the net, the increased<br>
access to information, all could work towards government as provider of<br>
authoritative information rather than as controller of interactions.<br>
<p>
I just heard an example of how these ideas are in the air.  On the Lehrer<br>
NewsHour last night there was an interview, I think with Charles Murray,<br>
about his book on libertarianism.  In the book he apparently has his<br>
own suggestion (more of a thought experiment) for an alternative, which<br>
would be to let companies explicitly "opt out" of government regulation.<br>
They'd have to make it clear up front that they were doing that,<br>
so you'd have a choice of flying on a government-regulated airline or<br>
one which was unregulated.  Murray argued that unregulated businesses,<br>
in order to compete, would have to make sure they were just as safe as<br>
the regulated ones, but that they'd be able to do it more efficiently.<br>
<p>
So from the point of view of making a difference in the world, I would<br>
lean towards the product-ban alternative proposal.  Whether this makes<br>
sense in terms of a career path, I don't know.  But it seems like an<br>
area where some practical results could occur.<br>
