danny explains<br>
: No, Im saying the whole planet was 80% the size that it is now.  And<br>
: scientists can tell this by the way the continents fit right now. When you<br>
: put them together there are spaces between them which grow in size the<br>
: further north and south you go, but this space is no longer there when you<br>
: shrink the whole planet to 80% of what it is now, then they fit perfectly.<br>
<p>
Yes, you said that.  Repeating it is no help.<br>
Where does the extra volume come from?<br>
<p>
I should also point out that the continents *cannot* "fit perfectly" on <br>
a smaller globe.  I need not look at them to say so.  The difference in <br>
curvature must introduce distortions.  As mapmakers do when squashing<br>
the globe to the plane, you can choose among several kinds of distortion<br>
(of shape, of area, of distance, of straight lines) -- but such selection <br>
makes the mapping to the smaller globe arbitrary, and therefore suspect.<br>
<p>
I'm surprised nobody has said the continents have shrunk by 1/5.<br>
<p>
: I forgot to mention scientists think this is due to the very dense core<br>
: being transfered to the much less dense mantle.<br>
<p>
Transferred how?  By injections of gas (or antimatter) into the core?<br>
By dwarves shifting slag out of their mines?<br>
