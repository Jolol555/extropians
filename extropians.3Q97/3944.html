I have a growing suspicion that the free market is more in-line with my<br>
views toward transhumanism than any other economic arrangment. <br>
<p>
What is our greatest enemy at this point? I would argue it is entropy. <br>
<p>
The free market is non-entropic in the sense that is a complex adpative<br>
system. (Those of you with more background in systems theory may add or<br>
correct at will...)<br>
<p>
The free market can be said to adapt in the sense that it is capable of<br>
maintaining a certain equilibrium of interests, and also changes over<br>
time to deal with supply and demand issues, inefficency, and scarcity.<br>
The existence of "price" tends to preserve transactional information.<br>
Indeed, as free market economies grow and diversify (the result of the<br>
impetus to innovate for increased efficency and sell such innovation for<br>
increased resources), the system acquires more participants, more<br>
relations between participants and more complex behavior of the<br>
participants. This seems to be a spontaneous increase in complexity,<br>
unplanned and unchecked. Non-entropic, indeed. The free market<br>
self-organizes in accordance with the fluctuations that normally occur<br>
due to outside environmental factors (resources, disasters, etc.) In<br>
this sense, I would argue, the free market never reaches a complete<br>
equilibrium. Indeed, it is this nonequilibrium that keeps it dissipative<br>
and healthy. And finally, for the same reasons, the free market is<br>
self-maintaining. It is shielded from utter annihilation by its ability<br>
to fluctuate in accordance with otherwise destructive input. <br>
<p>
This seems non-entropic given the greater possibilities of increases in<br>
complexity and information. A regulation can arguably make things more<br>
complex, but seems also to result in an information loss. Take, for<br>
example, regulations on the emission of toxic gases. When an outsider<br>
steps in and denotes X units to be the highest legal limit on the<br>
emission of toxic gas Y, the non-complying actor must either arrest the<br>
emission by cutting production or acquire a new means of production that<br>
is in compliance. This increases complexity, but only because another<br>
actor has entered the picture (the regulation). However, the information<br>
concerning what is efficient, what is Y's impact upon the environment,<br>
etc. is lost.<br>
<p>
What do you think? <br>

Out of time,<br>
