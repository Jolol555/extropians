In a message dated 97-08-21 05:30:09 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
<i> &gt; So you don't think Marshall Savage's scheme to use OTECs to raise</i><br>
<i> &gt; lots of spirulina and dump some of it (with the attendant carbon)</i><br>
<i> &gt; to the ocean bottom will help?</i><br>
 <br>
 Will this not risk the creation of dead sea bottoms as aerobic decay<br>
 processes consume all the available oxygen, creating a layer of<br>
 hydrogen-sulphide laden water (which kills most aerobic lifeforms)?  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
I seem to recall several things that might impact upon this:<br>
<p>
    1.  OTEC's work best when the tempeture differential is greatest....the<br>
location that best fits this is deep-sea equatorial waters...the sea floor<br>
waters many thousands of feet down are barely above freezing...the surface is<br>
equatorially hot.  (was in Yuma the other day...was 115 degrees...and Yuma is<br>
still a ways north of the equator)<br>
<p>
    2. The  deep sea equatorial waters are deserts...that is they have no<br>
life in them except near land (shallows)...due to lack of nutrients and lack<br>
of oxygen in the water...(????maybe...I dunno)<br>
<p>
     3. If 1. and 2. are true then the problem would not arise I wouldn't<br>
think.<br>
<p>
As an aside...what's holding back OTEC production of Hydrogen and "The<br>
Hydrogen Economy"?...It would seem to be an absolute end to any question of<br>
an "energy shortage"...as well as continued carbon dioxide emission into the<br>
atmosphere .(CO2 driven global warming)...and a host of other solutions to<br>
present day problems.(food shortage...)and relatively speaking..wouldn't cost<br>
much to implement. (replace IC engines with Hydrogen Fuel cells..transport<br>
hydrogen overland via gas pipelines...etc)..or are they really problems?  Or<br>
just excuses for new taxes and restrictive legislation?<br>
<p>
When (if) we do go to a hydrogen economy with hydrogen from deep-sea OTECs<br>
being shipped to civilization via Hydrogen Tankers...(multi-ton cyronic<br>
surface-effect  Ram-wings I would think....100+ mph...burn Hydrogen for fuel<br>
...able to reach any ocean or river port in a few days..(thereby accessible<br>
to vast pecentage of worlds population)..fast enough to avoid storms....I<br>
want the job of driving one...talk about LONG DISTANCE trucking!!!!!!!  (and<br>
no Bears...)<br>
