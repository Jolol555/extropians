Lee Daniel Crocker &lt;lee@piclab.com&gt; said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I, for one, presently intend to preserve myself both in a Dewar and</i><br>
<i>&gt; in a perpetual web site.  Both will be expensive.  If it came down</i><br>
<i>&gt; to a decision on my deathbed that I could afford to be suspended</i><br>
<i>&gt; only at the cost of giving up the web site that contained a lifetime</i><br>
<i>&gt; of values and goals, I'd be inclined to keep the web site.</i><br>
<p>
	Wooow, this is a great idea!  I've been trying to find some<br>
way to "perpetually" archive much digital information such as diaries<br>
and e-mail conversations which contain my intentions and goals and as<br>
you say, this is what is really important and what is really me.  But<br>
you've made me realize: why lock it away in some vault or under some<br>
dewar?  Put it on the web!<br>
<p>
	How do you intend on accomplishing this?  It's great that<br>
there are organizations like Cryo-Care that can perpetually fund dewar<br>
storage, it's too bad they apparently can't also do things like<br>
perpetually fund data storage or a web site.  (I've asked Cryo-Care<br>
about this) It sounds like you know of a way to accomplish this.<br>
Please tell us more.<br>
<p>
