Sooo... what does everybody think of the latest crypto bill passing<br>
its way thru congress?  My felling is, despite key-recovery's ultimate<br>
unworkability, this still starts a chilling precedent.  If they pass<br>
the bill, congress will allocate 100's of millions of dollars to law<br>
enforcemnt to make it happen.  In the end it may not work, but since<br>
millions have already been spent, efforts will continue by the<br>
government to eliminate privacy throgh even more draconian means.  I'm<br>
no expert on crypto so I'm just guessing, and feeling a little<br>
paranoid.<br>
<p>
Do we have anything to worry about?  Will privacy only be achievable<br>
by the techno-savvy and financially wealthy, or not?<br>
<p>
Any hope?  I need some cheering up.<br>
<p>
<p>
Paul<br>
