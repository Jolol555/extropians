Ev, the power isn't minute, it's just difuse. That's<br>
OK, because nearly all the power you use in your home<br>
is in a very difuse manner, for heating, cooling,<br>
and domestic hot water. You can make fairly effective<br>
use of a difuse source if you can use it directly, as<br>
for cooling your house using the ground as a heat sink.<br>
concentrating the energy gets hard. The lower the heat<br>
differential, the more working fluid you need, and the<br>
laws of thermodynamics place very tough constraints<br>
on your designs. Fotunately, you only need this<br>
hi-quality energy for a very small part of your<br>
overall household needs. With Nanotech, the balence<br>
between captial costs and running costs shifts<br>
dramatically, and geothermal becomes much more<br>
attractive. Currently, the payback is 2-6 years,<br>
depending on climate and availability of land.<br>
<p>
IMO, we nanotech can easily be powered using<br>
geothermal and solar at our current population<br>
density sufficiently to permit each of us to live<br>
a lifestyle that's wildy luxurious by today's<br>
standards, with no need for outside energy. You<br>
can almost use today's technologies to meet today's<br>
concept of modestly wealthy lifestyle. With nanotech,<br>
our energy usage can be a great deal mor efficient,<br>
with near-perfcect insulation, heat exchangers<br>
everywhere, perfectly smooth pipes with custom-<br>
designed curves and adaptive laminar surfeces to<br>
decrease friction, diamondiod vacuum-filled windows,<br>
lighting with near-perfect efficiency, and of course<br>
computer-controlled everything.<br>
<p>
However: this vision artificailly holds our current lifestyle<br>
nearly constant, merely moving each human up to the level of<br>
the currently very wealthy. The truth is that a society using<br>
nanotech on this (modest) level will be radically different<br>
than today's society even if no SI emerges. If you have a<br>
power-intensive project, (A large-scale space launch, or rapid<br>
terra-forming)  you'll need something beyond solar and geothermal.<br>
I believe that nanotech-built fusion plants make the most<br>
sense for these projects.<br>
