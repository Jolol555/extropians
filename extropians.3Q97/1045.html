     Thanks for the heads up on the rules regarding META discussions.  <br>
     Missed that part.  But as for me, I'm rather weary of the <br>
     what-qualifies-as-viable thread and there's been more said about the <br>
     inviability of topics *like*...I can't type it but it's two words and <br>
     the first one sounds like "hole" and the second like "whiffed" &lt;G&gt;).  <br>
     <br>
     I promise to redeem the perceived spamishness of my rants in defending <br>
     the innocent (a.k.a. overtly idealistic) in a more robust topic coming <br>
     soon to a digest near you.  No time for being cheeky.  We've got a <br>
     singularity to get to!  (Will there be "comic" extropians?)<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
