About neuro, nerves, etc. I've just remebered, when reading Bren's <br>
reply, an interesting possibility:<br>
<p>
When I was prepairing my M.Sc. thesis, I had for times, to be awoke <br>
in my university, to use four of the computers of there ant the <br>
same time and finish the simulations of such thesis. So, I got in <br>
contact (far, of course...) with one or other cockroaches that <br>
wandered by the site, at night. Once, I tried to verify if they were <br>
neuro-sensible to something like a simple control signal of my mind, <br>
as "stop", "move left", "move right" (not speaking, but trying to <br>
move it with the mind fixed on it). The most interesting <br>
is that, in a first look,  it really seem so... So I thought that if <br>
we should monitor its nervous system and really prove such <br>
interaction (even if statistically, in a first moment), the menthal <br>
transductor would be, practically discovered. Just replicate the <br>
part of a cockroach's nervous system, associated with the <br>
effect (or put cockroaches's little heads connected to electronic <br>
circuits... argh and hehehe). Jokes off, studying these very simpler <br>
nervous systems is much easier than even the little white (or <br>
phosphorescent, hehehe) mice... After, I saw a report about Hokkaido, <br>
Japan, where they are already controlling cockroaches and <br>
crickets (like that of Beaves &amp; Butthead, hehehe) with electronic <br>
circuits, as if they where small "cockrobots" (hehehe). It would <br>
perhaps  be possible to use a circuit similar to this to verify <br>
a cockroach's sensibility to human menthal interactions. I have <br>
tryied to develop such experiment here in Brazil, but the Professor, <br>
chief of the Biophysics department said we don't have hereb the <br>
technology necessary to deal with small nervous systems like that. <br>
And came back to his monkeys and opossums...   <br>

PS: Is there any japanese here????<br>

<i>&gt; Prof. Gomes &lt;gomes@cnen.gov.br&gt; responded to Anders Sandberg</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;nv91-asa@nada.kth.se&gt; remark:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm, this gave me a truly bizarre idea: if somebody has a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; high-resolution chromophorous skin and a net link, it might be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; possible to use it as a kind of videophone. Imagine talking to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; small face on your palm... </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; **** or directly in the eyes... (something like that glasses tv set</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that was shown once at Discovery...)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Why even go through these messy, noisy, insensitive, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; inefficient, multiple transduction stages to and from light?  Let's</i><br>
<i>&gt; directly stimulate the optic nerve.  Or even better directly produce</i><br>
<i>&gt; the visual experience right in our visual cortex (or the corresponding</i><br>
<i>&gt; much more capable cortex to which we've been uploaded.)  We certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't pump audio through a speaker and back into a microphone every</i><br>
<i>&gt; time we want to communicate audio signals!  Imagine the perfect visual</i><br>
<i>&gt; clarity one might experience without having to go through all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; messy mechanics of a vidio display and the eye and retina...  I hate</i><br>
<i>&gt; heavy glasses and display screens that always get dirty.</i><br>
