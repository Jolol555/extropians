While your theory is interesting, your "observations" on sleep are<br>
somewhat incorrect.  People don't "go back to their early childhood"<br>
during deep sleep.  Assuming for the moment that you mean that people go<br>
back during dreams, there is very little dreaming during deep sleep<br>
(Stage 3/4).  Most dreaming is during REM sleep, and the brain is<br>
relatively aroused during REM.  In fact, the brain is fully "awake" in<br>
many senses - it actively suppresses motor function while you dream (and<br>
greatly raises the sensory threshold so most sensory input is blocked<br>
out).  A majority of dreams are reported to be a mixture of very recent<br>
(the past day or so) memories and associations between those memories<br>
and slightly older memories (sometimes very bizarre associations).  A<br>
very small proportion of dreams involves distant memories, such as early<br>
childhood memories.<br>
     Some other sleep-related comments:  True, the cortical oscillations<br>
are slow and of high amplitude.  But sleep depth doesn't "shut down" the<br>
less "primitive" parts of our brain:  Those oscillations are from<br>
cortical cells firing in unison, most likely due to thalamic neurons<br>
controlling the pattern of cortical firing.  All these parts of our<br>
brain are still active - they still function.  Furthermore, these parts<br>
of our brain are still functional in childhood - our brains are almost<br>
completely developed by childhood.  True, not all the connections are<br>
complete, but many are.  <br>
    People cycle through sleep stages several times in the night.  We<br>
don't just get into a deeper sleep as the night progresses, it gets deep<br>
then shallow, even occasionally waking up before drifting back into the<br>
deeper stages again.  And then, of course, there's REM sleep, which is<br>
electrically (EEG) nearly identical to awake brain activity.  Any<br>
signals we pick up tend to be incorporated into our dreams (REM sleep),<br>
when the threshold for sensory input is lower (i.e. more input can<br>
occur).  During stage 3/4 sleep, the threshold for sensory input is<br>
extremely high, so only something as strong as a loud alarm or other<br>
noise will be registered by the brain.  Weaker stimuli don't get past<br>
the auditory/visual nerves.  We don't wake up in the mornings because of<br>
increased sensory input (the "supply of reality") - just ask anybody<br>
that works a third shift or parties all night.  The need for sleep can<br>
temporarily override circadian rhythms, and easily override sensory<br>
input - that's why people who work those shifts can sleep til 1300 (1<br>
PM) and stay awake until 0500.  Of course, circadian rhythms can take<br>
precedence - thus the ability to nap in midafternoon, when your<br>
circadian rhythm is naturally "low".  No one is sure what initiates the<br>
transition from sleep to wake, or vice versa, but input from thermally<br>
sensitive neurons, and the brain's balance between acetylcholine and<br>
monoamine neuroactivity, have both been implicated.  The idea that the<br>
brain corrects "reality" is interesting, and one I've heard of before,<br>
but I still have the same question - if the brain is involved in fixing<br>
reality, why can someone be killed without getting the sensory input<br>
that says he is going to die?  That is, the external reality of sleeping<br>
in the wild (or on train tracks, etc.) can intrude on the person without<br>
the brain ever knowing - the brain and body will then stop functioning. <br>
Presumably, reality shouldn't change or change much if the brain is<br>
controlling reality and not just our perceptions of it.  In other words,<br>
how can external things intrude on your body if it is your brain which<br>
makes reality?  Even if you were conscious, and assumed that your brain<br>
intuitively knew physics well enough for a bullet to kill you, if you<br>
closed your eyes before you saw the shooter you wouldn't know the bullet<br>
was fired at you and you shouldn't get hit by it - unless you have a<br>
death wish.  And when you're asleep, there's no sensory input, so how<br>
can a bullet even hit you when it shouldn't exist?<br>
    Lack of sleep does not have the same effect as panic.  You can get<br>
hallucinations (not generally a symptom of panic but sometimes a cause)<br>
with long sleep deprivation.  More often though, slight confusion and<br>
the ability to fall asleep much more easily are the main neural<br>
manifestations.  Our bodies slow down slightly, whereas in panic our<br>
sympathetic nervous system is in overdrive.  Again, refer to the<br>
question above in regard to creating reality from within.<br>
<p>
Just my 2 cents...<br>
