<p>
Any voluntary restriction on your future actions is a donation of your<br>
freedom. Donate a portion of your freedom and you no longer "own"<br>
yourself entirely. "Own" in this sense is no more than a term of art for<br>
autonomy.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (Heck, one could even posit that a defining characteristic</i><br>
<i>&gt; of self-ownership is the ability to make promises, because those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; do not own themselves simply cannot make promises... they might be able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to mouth them, but they cannot make them.)</i><br>
<p>
Seems true, until you've made so many promises that you are no longer<br>
free. For example, I promise Joe (for some return benefit) that I will<br>
not do X. I correspondingly promise Jan (for some return benefit) that I<br>
will do Y. I then promise Jack (for another return benefit) that I will<br>
not do Z but I will do Q.  <br>
<p>
Et cetera.<br>
<p>
Eventually, it seems clear that at some point I will have restricted my<br>
actions to such an extent that everything not prohibited by contract is<br>
compulsory by contract. How can I then say that I own myself? I've sold<br>
my freedom to act for a certain consideration. My point, as you have<br>
quoted above, is that with the very first promise I make, I no longer<br>
own myself entirely. Again, ownership being a term-of-art for autonomy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; ...other than a social contract. People disagree as to the scope and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; extent of this contract, but I'm the only one that seems to think</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; that this is government any way you slice it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So have you gotten around to reading Friedman's The Machinery of Freedom,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Benson's The Enterprise of Law, or Tom Morrow's essay presented at Extro-1</i><br>
<i>&gt; (now available on the web) yet? The existence of these works is the primary</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason why no one on the list has yet bothered to explain to you in</i><br>
<i>&gt; intricate detail why they disagree with you about this.</i><br>
<p>
I'm familiar with the Friedman model (from DDF's website) and I agree<br>
that his is a practical, and workable system. I've never disputed this.<br>
But, I'm not sure how it supports the contention that a social contract<br>
can result in anything but a form of government. First, are you familiar<br>
with Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau? If so, maybe I should start by asking<br>
how, in your estimation, a social contract may avoid the label<br>
"government."<br>
