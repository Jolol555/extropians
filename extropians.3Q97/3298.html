      These people are murderers....pre-meditated murders.  In my opinion it <br>
      is no difference than if they outright killed their victims on the <br>
      scene.  The only difference is the "torture factor".....they not only <br>
      murder their victims they impose physiological and psychological <br>
      torture on them in their remaining period of life....because their <br>
      victims health will go into immediated decline...<br>

      Rick Knight responds:<br>
      <br>
      Is this an example of an unrestrained market or has an "excess" been <br>
      reached?<br>
<p>
To which I reply.<br>
<p>
This has nothing to do with a Free Market.  The essence of Free Market<br>
Economics is Freedom....(Duh...I wonner why they call it THAT?)...Individual<br>
Freedom...to which Theft, Slavery, Torture and Murder are Anathema.<br>
      <br>
      Not being callous, but am attempting to make a point that what is <br>
      *important* and irrelevent to one person can be emotionally rivoting <br>
      to the other (the tobacco industry is a trigger for me since its <br>
      products subdued both my parents).<br>
<p>
To which I reply.<br>
<p>
I've had friends die in Auto Accidents....should we ban Cars?<br>
<p>
Unless you can demonstrate that your parents were forced to inhale the<br>
noxious fumes of demon weed..(How Long was the literature available?  Do YOU<br>
beleive everything an Advertiser says?).then I say it was their<br>
choice...(kinda obvious?)..a BAD choice...but sometimes people make bad<br>
decesions...and suffer because of it.<br>
<p>
Being free is tough...it means you have to be responsible for your own<br>
actions.  And benifit or suffer because of them.<br>
<p>
You make good choices you might be another Bill Gates.<br>
<p>
You make bad choices....you might die.<br>
<p>
Call it "Evolution in Action"<br>
