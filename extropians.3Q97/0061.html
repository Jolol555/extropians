     Just got some snazzy Win95 wallpaper (okay the resolution could be <br>
     better) of the composite photo of the Hubble Deep Field, a patch of <br>
     sky 1/30th the diameter of the full moon and completely dark as viewed <br>
     by the human eye.  Hubble's images are billions of times greater than <br>
     what we could see.  The astronomers set their sight on this dark area <br>
     of the sky only to render a field with hundreds of GALAXIES.  Even if <br>
     it's not infinity, it's inifite ENOUGH (there's that debate over <br>
     ENOUGH again &lt;G&gt;) for we present-day pre-immortal beings.<br>
     <br>
     I've just been with that feeling of awe for a few days, the incredible <br>
     enormity of it all.  We are looking out farther and looking in deeper <br>
     (both physically and mentally).  It seems that as we become a smaller <br>
     and smaller blip in the vastness, we become more aware of our <br>
     fundamental connection to it all.  <br>
     <br>
     This morning, some very unattractive old guy in an even-less <br>
     attractive clunker of a van cut me off at an intersection.  Living in <br>
     a dense urban area, one's instinct is to chide, flip off, grumble some <br>
     protest (which I did).  However, it's starting to hit me more and more <br>
     that as soon as I say that, something says back "He's you".  Today, <br>
     this prompted a philosophical question of why/how could he be ME?  Why <br>
     am I considering that I am not the isolated individual, but part of a <br>
     continuum where we are just beginning to free exchange ideas, energy <br>
     and contribution?  <br>
     <br>
     Further, what is selfhood that it could be supposedly preserved <br>
     chemically and resurrected from deep freeze?  What is life without the <br>
     context of familiarity?  Does it take only an advanced intellect to <br>
     re-adapt to an unrecognizeable future to which you suddenly awaken?  <br>
     Or does it take a disconnected heart as well?  Does the person with <br>
     irrecoverable amnesia, who remembers no past, has no context, no <br>
     affinity with lovers, family, even children...has that original <br>
     unrecoverable person died since there is no self context?  Is one's <br>
     self an energy, an essence?  Or is the physiology of our bodies a <br>
     conduit and containment field for that which is us?  At the end of <br>
     life, are we just as willing to give up the notion of the self we've <br>
     amassed as we would a role in a play and just go onto another role <br>
     (human, explicitly sentient or not) in the continuum of <br>
     energy/information exchange in this vastness?<br>
     <br>
     If I had to choose ongoingness of my personal awareness, I'd choose an <br>
     uploading and storage of my experiences because that's more me than my <br>
     body which seems to curiously change from year to year.  Freezing my <br>
     body (or even more whimsically, my head) seems a rather quaint notion. <br>
      Does extropian thinking focus so much on the physically proven and <br>
     sound as to consider this the most preferable and viable solution to <br>
     achieving "immortality"?  As a mental exercise, I wonder what <br>
     discoveries of the essence, the unforseen would radically change such <br>
     notions?  That which is beyond the horizon where the fishermen's wives <br>
     are no longer visible from the shore and you are going on gut instinct <br>
     and conviction.<br>
     <br>
     The Deep Field photo struck me in somewhat the same way the end of the <br>
     second Moriarty episode of ST:TNG where they were able to convince him <br>
     into believing he was no longer a holographically conjured character <br>
     but a free, sentient and physically REAL person.  But in the *actual* <br>
     reality, (the Star Trek reality), he was only a program with plenty of <br>
     storage in a small cube, perfectly content and oblivious to any <br>
     preconceived limits other than his own perceived mortality.  <br>
     <br>
     Personally, I'm rather curious about what happens to a "self" released <br>
     from physical containment.  I suppose for some extropians, in comes <br>
     down to going for the likelier (or preferred) outcome: being <br>
     resurrected physically in a more advanced future Earth or being <br>
     separated from a pre-established self and assimilated into the unknown <br>
     (which could also include just ceasing to "be" in a physical and/or <br>
     self-aware capacity).  Is life extension enough?  Is even immortality <br>
     enough?  Seems like life without challenge and quest is apathy and <br>
     inertia, once assured comfort has become mundane and there's no energy <br>
     one needs to devote towards the most inane survival issue.<br>
     <br>
     To subscribe to life extension methods such as cryonics, I'd have to <br>
     be more sure of what "life" is.  Too many details missing from this to <br>
     make an informed decision.  To me, it's akin to a kid saying, when I <br>
     grow up, I want to be a firefighter, all because s/he likes the trucks <br>
     and the uniform and is completely oblivious to the danger and <br>
     personality type required for such a job.  Maybe that's enough of a <br>
     notion to go fot it.  For me, cryonics sounds like a better spin on <br>
     life insurance...you may get to enjoy it.  Gentlemen, place your bets. <br>
     <br>
