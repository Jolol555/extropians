 THREES<br>
 DOG AND PONY,  REV. 1.1<br>
<p>
 (Duane Elms, Leslie Fish)<br>
<p>
 Deep in engineering, where mortals seldom go<br>
 A manager and customer come looking for a show;<br>
 They pass, amused, among us and they sign in on the log<br>
 They've come to see our pony and they've come to see our dog.<br>
<p>
      Three things to be wary of: A new kid in his prime,<br>
      A man that knows the answers, and code that runs first time.<br>
<p>
 Summoned from our cubicles, to conference room we go<br>
 We bring our dog and pony, 'cause we know they'll want a show,<br>
 Watching while we enter, with a shifty, restless eye<br>
 The customer sits waiting in his pin-striped suit and tie.<br>
<p>
      Three things never trust in: That's the vendor's final bill<br>
      The promises your boss makes and the customer's good will.<br>
<p>
 The pony kicks his heels up as the doggie does his trick,<br>
 And hams it up with vigor as we lay it on real thick;<br>
 The customer just watches as we do this song and dance<br>
 Then reaches for his briefcase, only giving us a glance.<br>
<p>
      Three things see no end: a loop with exit code done wrong,<br>
      A semaphore untested, and the change that comes along.<br>
<p>
 From briefcase then there comes a list of things we must revise;<br>
 And all but four within the room are taken by surprise.<br>
 And all but four are thinking of their last job with remorse,<br>
 The customer, the manager, the doggie and the horse.<br>
<p>
      Three things hold no secrets: files that somehow hit the net<br>
      The boss's secretary, and the third thing ... I forget.<br>
<p>
 First, twenty-one new features that we somehow must add in<br>
 Then, thirty-seven changes show up, much to our chagrin;<br>
 And this thing's just inadequate, and that thing's just plain wrong<br>
 And, by the way, your schedule's about three months too long.<br>
<p>
      Three things it is better far that only you should know:<br>
      How much you're paid, the schedule pad, and what is just for show.<br>
<p>
 The customer proceeds to go through each change, line by line<br>
 Excruciating detail which no logic can divine;<br>
 And when it ends, there's only four not sitting there agog<br>
 The customer, the manager, the pony and the dog.<br>
<p>
      Three things never anger: First, the one who runs your deck,<br>
      The one who does the backup and the one who signs your check.<br>
<p>
 Now we are contract software types who spend our days and nights<br>
 Imbedded in the system, down with all the bits and bytes;<br>
 And none but us can tell full well the damage done today,<br>
 It's what they do not know for which they're gonna have to pay.<br>
<p>
      Three things are most perilous: connectors that corrode<br>
      Unproven algorithms and self-modifying code.<br>
<p>
 The manager and customer are quick to leave this bunch<br>
 They take the dog and pony, and they all go out to lunch;<br>
 Now how will we avenge ourselves on those who raise our ire?<br>
 Write code that self-destructs the day the warranties expire.<br>
<p>
      Three things trust above all else: Your knowledge of your craft,<br>
      That someone turns a profit, and that you will get the shaft.<br>
<p>
