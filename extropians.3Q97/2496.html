WHAT?  What about all those famous stories where a GA does in 28 steps what a<br>
human could only do in 31?  GAs produce code that's tight where ours is<br>
bloated, and bloated where ours is tight.  Hence the double cycle.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; How much time would it take for a nanomachine to construct a nuclear weapon?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think we can assume that nano is at least as destructive as nuke.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Numbers, please. It is easy to claim something like this, but is it</i><br>
<i>&gt; really true?</i><br>
<p>
I don't know.  But you do:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Building a nuke: you need around 10 kilograms of uranium 235 (or whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; isotope it was). There is around 2 grams uranium / tonne in the crust of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; earth, of which 0.72% is U235, so to get 10 kg you need to process around</i><br>
<i>&gt; 7000 tonnes of crust. I'm not sure how much energy is required to reduce</i><br>
<i>&gt; the UO2 to pure U, but it is a noticeable amount (are there a chemist</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the house?). Assuming the nanites cover a large patch with solar</i><br>
<i>&gt; collectors, they can get around 500 W/m^2, which has to cover their</i><br>
<i>&gt; replication, search through the crust, reduction, isotope separation and return</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the "base"; how much energy this is is a bit hard to tell right now</i><br>
<i>&gt; (it is 1.30 in the morning here :-), but it looks like it will take</i><br>
<i>&gt; a while for the bomb-mold to blow up. A wild guess would be around a</i><br>
<i>&gt; week.</i><br>
<p>
Well, there's a couple of questions I'd pose about nuclear nanotech:<br>
<p>
1)  Can mini-assemblers build mini-thermonuclear devices?  If you have 10<br>
grams instead of kilograms, but you still put the deuterium at the center and<br>
jacket with U-238, could you get the same effect?  What about custom-assembled<br>
crystals that will collapse easily and tightly... maybe laced with water to<br>
slow neutrons down?<br>
<p>
2)  What about direct fusion devices?  Inertial confinement would be my guess.<br>
 Take the deuterium and imprison it inside a fullerene-bracketed block of<br>
diamond, then apply a large energy pulse, perhaps from an enormously efficient<br>
quantum-well laser.<br>
<p>
3)  Given either of the two above, could you build a REALLY HUGE thermonuclear<br>
bomb, perhaps by surrounding the item with a huge U-238 crystal?  Direct the<br>
blast in a specific direction using the properties of crystals, maybe with a<br>
bit of quantum mechanics mixed in?  Use the blast to pump a graser?<br>
<p>
In other words, nanotechnology operates as close to the level of nuclear<br>
reactions as we operate to the level of chemical explosives.  I can't help but<br>
think that there will be similar improvements in technology.  Shaped charges. <br>
Fuel-air-explosives.  You get the idea.  Only some tiny fraction of atoms fizz<br>
or fuse.  Maybe with a properly shaped crystal, perhaps utilizing a few<br>
quantum properties to guide neutrons or arrange collisions, you could improve<br>
that by an order of magnitude.<br>
<p>
I speculate that nanotechnology will result in an improvement in nuclear<br>
weapons comparable with the superiority of TNT over gunpowder, for similar<br>
reasons.  And while some of the quantum calculations above may seem rather<br>
numerically intense, remember that the calculations will probably be done on<br>
quantum computers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Doing the same work as a nuke with nanites (i.e. disassembling everything</i><br>
<i>&gt; within a few hundred meters and blasting everything within a few kilometers)</i><br>
<i>&gt; is rather tricky, since it is extremely energy intensive. You need plenty</i><br>
<i>&gt; of energy to do the disassembly (essentially you have to break most molecular</i><br>
<i>&gt; bonds), and nanites are bad at making blast waves.</i><br>
<p>
I don't see why.  First of all, they'll be able to construct explosives<br>
completely to order.  But let's be conservative and figure that they use TNT. <br>
I'm far from an expert on explosives... but couldn't you get a bit of an<br>
improvement by detonating the ENTIRE bomb with electronic synchronization, so<br>
that the entire blast arrives time-on-target?  A shock wave is just that, a<br>
wave.  So modern TNT is a huge splash made up a lot of little uncoordinated<br>
splashes, while nanotech TNT is the precisely synchronized sum of all those<br>
splashes.  Almost exactly like the distinction between a light bulb and a laser.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would like to do some more careful calculations on this (or rather, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; somebody with the right knowledge did it instead of a bumbling amateur like</i><br>
<i>&gt; me), but it is IMHO clear that we should not be overly worried about</i><br>
<i>&gt; nano-built nuclear weapons but rather nano-ebola. Everything in the world</i><br>
<i>&gt; has limits set by the laws of nature.</i><br>
<p>
Like, say, lightspeed?  Or thermodynamics?  My "workarounds" page for things<br>
like that is still up.  Again, I'm trying to point out that a bit of<br>
imagination is necessary to see the enormous destructive potentials here.  I<br>
think we can safely extrapolate a *little* bit beyond current capabilities. <br>
Most of what you're saying has nanotech being less dangerous than modern<br>
technology.  I can't help but compare this to the old saw about "Atomic<br>
technology may someday equal the capabilities of present bombs, but it is<br>
unlikely to produce anything more dangerous."  [Paraphrase.]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Remember that the Bad Guys aren't operating under the same restrictions as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Good Guys.  The wannabe dictators will use directed evolution on a scale no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Good Guy would dare to contemplate.  And evolving mutually competing predators</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will go a lot faster than mutually supporting immune systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ever thought about the fact that the immune system isn't mutually supporting?</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is rather a balance of predators which do not predate on each other since</i><br>
<i>&gt; that destroys their fitness.</i><br>
<p>
Interrogative?  Expand, please.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Good guys will be motivated to contemplate directed evolution since the bad guys</i><br>
<i>&gt; do it; and they tend to have more brainpower and money on their side. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think the weapon of openness is important here.</i><br>
<p>
It could go either way.  Maybe the bad guys kidnap all the scientists and then<br>
use pain-center stimulation to achieve faster results.  Idealism may win<br>
battles and break ties, but it is not a defense to be trusted.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Our immune systems are unimaginably more sophisticated than a virus or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bacterium, using controlled evolution to combat natural evolution.  And yet we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; still suffer from colds and diseases.  The only reason that the viruses</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; haven't killed us outright is that it isn't good strategy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Exactly. So the major question is: is it possible to create a nanite</i><br>
<i>&gt; infection that is deadly (or subtle) enough to wipe out all competition?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't reflexively answer 'yes' to it, try to give a considered answer</i><br>
<i>&gt; of why it is likely (or why not). Note that it would have to be able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to spread across the world fast enough to subvert everyone, or circumvent</i><br>
<i>&gt; all attempts at detection. That is assuming a lot.</i><br>
<p>
Alternatively, it might only have to take over a single power base.  Your<br>
question assumes that the goo, once detected, is doomed.  My version assumes<br>
that the goo, once established, is undefeatable.  This is pretty much what<br>
we're arguing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I want to repeat this, because it's important.  Our immune systems are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; closest analogue to proposed nano-immunities.  The mismatch in available power</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and sophistication is enormous.  Our immune systems learn from experience, use</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; controlled and directed evolution, have memories... everything but the ability</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to consciously design things.  And yet the viruses waltz casually through our</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bodies, because it's so much easier to destroy than create.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Have you studied medicine? Then you know viruses certainly do not waltz causally</i><br>
<i>&gt; through your body (of which around *one kilogram* apparently is immune cells, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; you are a normally built male).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is easier to destroy than create!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You repeat this as a mantra. And of course you have the second law of</i><br>
<i>&gt; thermodynamics on your side. The problem is that you do not attempt to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make quantitative comparisions between the strengths of different systems,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and instead rely on plausible-sounding arguments. That is definitely</i><br>
<i>&gt; *not* a good strategy if you are trying to discuss something important</i><br>
<i>&gt; where we do need a well planned policy.</i><br>
<p>
How can I make quantitative comparisions between systems that don't exist? <br>
I'm just trying to point out the qualitative causal forces at work.  When<br>
we're finished cataloguing, we could try to set up a quantitative comparision,<br>
bearing in mind that it would be utterly false-to-fact and useful only for<br>
speculative purposes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; If any human is even capable of designing an immune system,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; then the average educated person will be capable of breaking it, given time</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and effort.  Any twisted genius will go through it like tissue paper.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sigh, here we go again. What is your evidence for this? A few months ago</i><br>
<i>&gt; somebody on sci.nanotech posted a challenge for people to come up with</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotech immune systems and he would find flaws in them. I don't think</i><br>
<i>&gt; there was any follow-up, which is sad, but it might be worth taking up</i><br>
<i>&gt; here on the list. Unfortunately I do lack the time to deal with this</i><br>
<i>&gt; as carefully I would like, since I consider this very important, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; let's try a simple sketch to see how easy it is to vanquish a designed</i><br>
<i>&gt; immune system:</i><br>
<p>
Yes, let's!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The body is surrounded by an inert skin (say diamond);</i><br>
<p>
Isn't diamond something that can be set on fire at sufficient temperatures? <br>
Isn't the crystal fragile when properly angled forces are directed against it?<br>
 How much of an insulator is it for temperature?  What about gamma rays?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; attempts to</i><br>
<i>&gt; physically breach it can be detected from the inside and the surrounding</i><br>
<i>&gt; region sealed.</i><br>
<p>
Sealed by what?  If it's better than diamond, why not surround the whole body<br>
with it?  If the sealant is worse than diamond, or is diamond, why wouldn't<br>
anything capable of penetrating the external wall go right through the sealant?<br>
<p>
What detector mechanism are you using?  Can I falsely trigger it over the<br>
entire body, thus making the "detector" useless and redundant?  If sealed-off<br>
areas are easier to attack, wouldn't the false alarm let me peel off an entire<br>
layer?  And why couldn't I just repeat the action until you were the size of<br>
an apple core?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The rest of the organism (could be a transhuman, factory</i><br>
<i>&gt; or a city) is compartmentalized with similar walls; infected sections</i><br>
<i>&gt; can be isolated.</i><br>
<p>
Okay, so you've made the problem of immunity recursive on immunity for a<br>
single section.  This may actually be an excellent plan of defense, allowing<br>
for partial breaches and reserves.  But a design for an immune system it's not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Immune devices move around, interrogating "cells"</i><br>
<i>&gt; (subsystems) by comparing their surface markings with allowed types</i><br>
<i>&gt; (this list can be kept secret from someone who disassembles a device</i><br>
<i>&gt; by using a trapdoor function), and occasionally disassembling the</i><br>
<i>&gt; cell to check its innards.</i><br>
<p>
Okay, I see a trend developing in your plan.  Detection is the important<br>
thing; it's assumed that pockets of infection, once detected, can be<br>
obliterated.  Very much like the human immune system.  But if viruses could<br>
outfight white blood cells, we'd be dead.  I'll conceed that fooling detection<br>
might be made difficult, almost impossible, through the use of digital<br>
signatures.  But again - how do you keep a single cell from being penetrated? <br>
Once a cell is penetrated, you destroy it - but does the destruction keep the<br>
infection from spreading?  A single spore might be defeated by this strategy. <br>
A sea of gray goo won't be.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Other immune devices check the general</i><br>
<i>&gt; activity, looking for deviations from the normal state (there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a paper on the net somewhere about using GAs to evolve anti-hacking</i><br>
<i>&gt; agents, this is something similar).</i><br>
<p>
No comment.  Part of it isn't very complicated, given digital signatures. <br>
Nor, as far as I know, can a nanotech penetrate a wall invisibly.  I'll<br>
concede you perfect detection.  For this discussion, it's the fight I care about.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If a compartment is found to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; infected it is terminated with extreme prejudice (the human body</i><br>
<i>&gt; uses the granulocytes and their nasty cocktail of free radicals,</i><br>
<i>&gt; chlorine acids and proteolytic enzymes, this would use something</i><br>
<i>&gt; worse or simply throw out the infected compartment from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; organism).</i><br>
<p>
Why shouldn't the infected compartment terminate a nearby one with extreme<br>
prejudice, and do it first?  As far as I can tell, your strategy simply lets<br>
me destroy your entire complex cell by cell.  Penetrate a cell, watch it go up<br>
in flame... repeat.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Note that production of new immune devices can be done</i><br>
<i>&gt; by assemblers in well defended deep regions, and that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; devices themselves can be fairly simple since they do not need</i><br>
<i>&gt; to replicate, just find threats.</i><br>
<p>
And the gray goo can do likewise... but it has more resources, since it<br>
surrounds the city.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So, what are the obvious holes?</i><br>
<p>
The real obvious one is this.  Your immune system - any immune system<br>
conceived along these lines - requires that two nanosystems fight each other<br>
to a standstill.  If two nanosystems fight and destroy each other, then any<br>
city in an island of gray goo is doomed.  The goo simply makes repeated<br>
attacks, and each time, the city shrinks a little.  We won't even speak of<br>
such horrors as cutting off that city's solar power.<br>
<p>
In short, the immune system requires that *defense* have an advantage over<br>
*offense*.  I can conceive of any number of ways that this could happen.  I<br>
shall now proceed to list them.<br>
<p>
The most obvious way is to have a symmetrical battle.  Two systems battle. <br>
They destroy each other.  A small no-mans-zone is created.  But then, both<br>
city and sea expand into the zone at the same rate, gobbling atoms as they go.<br>
 If more nano is required to destroy than to defend, even by a small amount,<br>
then the city actually builds up more raw material as it goes along.  Maybe<br>
ditto for energy reserves.  Depends on the details of the molecular landscape.<br>
<p>
Then there's the barrier whose surface is stronger than the amount of energy<br>
that could be concentrated on any one point.  There are two opposing forces<br>
here.  First of all, the barrier is dispersed and the energy is concentrated. <br>
But the barrier is deep, while the energy might be a single pulse.  Depends on<br>
the details of the molecular battleground.  A miniature swords-vs.-armor thing.<br>
<p>
Moravec has a great discussion of exotic forms of matter(1).  "Higgsium" is<br>
1e18 times as dense as water; "Monopolium" is 1e25 times as dense.  My<br>
impression was that Higgsium might be hard to penetrate, even using Higgsium<br>
projectiles; only Monopolium would suffice.  With Higgsium and without<br>
Monopolium, then, any area taken might be easy to hold onto.  With Monopolium,<br>
the reverse is true.<br>
<p>
Similarly - and here I speculate without knowledge - there might be a way to<br>
give a material an unbreakable "quantum surface tension".  Or subbaryonic<br>
picotechnology - "chromatic technology" - might use "quark barriers", surfaces<br>
as unbreakable as a proton.  (From what I know of quantum chromodynamics, this<br>
is incredibly unlikely.  The bubble would have to be pushed out by truly<br>
inconceivable forces; pre-Plank-time Big-Bang-type forces.  But hey, what do I know?)<br>
<p>
Then there's the simple possibility, dependent on molecular details of which I<br>
know nothing, that defense on the molecular level has an innate advantage over<br>
offense.  Certain molecules or nano-screens might simply be easier to form<br>
than to break, just like atoms or quarks.  As long as it is theoretically<br>
possible to pierce the screen, the possibility of piecemeal destruction<br>
remains - unless the screen is easier to "heal" around the breach, regaining<br>
the broken area.  Or the screen might be theoretically impossible to breach,<br>
which is what I've been speculating about all along.<br>
<p>
For that matter, one can speculate about a zone of space being made friendly<br>
to one force and hostile to another - maybe with electrical power being<br>
transmitted along scrambled frequencies; a carefully targeted attack or<br>
resource.  Maybe, even after a nuke in that area, the zone would be more<br>
quickly regained.  If attack requires "opening" to an opposite attack, or<br>
breaching a zone, then the city might regain more than it lost.  But this<br>
seems unlikely.  I can't really envision a "zone" that a nuke wouldn't<br>
destroy.  The only plausible persistent zoning would be the property of being<br>
surrounded by the good forces, rather than the bad forces.  Which means that<br>
the bad forces can peel the good guys like a potato; each time an attack<br>
occurs, a convexly curved surface turns flat.<br>
<p>
Nanosystems are always faced with "destruction by induction".  That is, you<br>
can always destroy one cell; therefore you can destroy the whole thing.  To<br>
defend against this, it is required that the system expand faster than the<br>
destruction OR that it be impossible to destroy one cell.<br>
<p>
This actually opens up a whole new vista of defense.  If a city has an innate<br>
advantage over the sea where expansion is concerned - if a compact form beats<br>
an englobing one, perhaps due to internal bracing or some such - the city can<br>
easily and quickly regain any area lost, even break into space and escape.<br>
<p>
I also speculated along similar lines in two places earlier; one with healing<br>
shields, another with the city grabbing the additional mass required to attack<br>
rather than defend.<br>
<p>
Speaking of escape, there's another workaround for "destruction by induction".<br>
 If you run into space, the gray goo might hurl itself after you, but it won't<br>
have the overwhelming resources required for "destruction by induction".  In<br>
addition, the effort of destruction might simply provide the city with a<br>
velocity boost.  Certainly things in space will be different than on the ground.<br>
<p>

<p>
So there are a lot of immune systems, just as there are many forms of attack. 
It's just that defense being favored over attack requires too much exotic
technology; the exotic attack technologies are far more conservative than the
exotic defense technologies.  The majority of strategic considerations are in
favor of attack; the only really hopeful strategic consideration is the city
being able to quickly expand into rich zones of destruction.
<p>
Ergo, it is easier to destroy than create.
