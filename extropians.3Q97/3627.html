Call it a memetic convergence, the meeting of like minds--I've had <br>
the most amazing afternoon!  I visited a 'salon' this afternoon and <br>
was introduced to two medical researchers from College Park, <br>
Maryland, who are currently preparing to conduct human toxicity <br>
screenings of a breakthrough set of drugs that boost the efficacy of <br>
chemotherapy or act as a single-agent therapy by stimulating the body's <br>
immune system.  One of these drugs, Betathine, in animal trials involving <br>
melanoma, myeloma and breast cancer in mice either prevented the <br>
formation of cancer cells or caused remission of existing cells.  And it <br>
showed very low toxicity in comparison to recombinant immune stimulants <br>
or chemotherapeutic agents. <br>
<p>
That in itself is exciting enough, but this set of drugs has three <br>
implications that are of interest to transhumanists.  (i)  The <br>
term 'nanopharmaceuticals' has been copyrighted to this set of drugs, <br>
because the doses are as small as 30 nanograms.  (ii)  If human trials <br>
go well, it will be possible in ten years for genetically predisposed <br>
humans to take a minute dose monthly to prevent the onset of specific <br>
types of cancer.  (iii)  Preliminary application to cells taken from <br>
persons suffering from premature-aging syndromes resulted in a halt in <br>
cellular deterioration, leading to speculation regarding a secondary use <br>
in anti-aging therapies.<br>
<p>
When human trials begin (the first is slated to focus on prevention <br>
of breast cancer in genetically predisposed women), I am sure that we <br>
will be hearing more about progress on this area of research.  They <br>
are in the process of setting up a nonprofit foundation to bring <br>
together resources to focus on this work, and a web site will be part <br>
of that.  I will be sure to post the URL to these lists.<br>
<p>
