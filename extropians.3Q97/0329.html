Thank you.  Even though your post (and perhaps my response) may trigger a <br>
holy war, an excellent common sense explanation of why anti-Microsoft <br>
bigots seem to not understand.<br>
<p>
To expound:<br>
<p>
Larry Ellison and Marc Andreeson are not the savior's of the 'computing for <br>
the little folk' as some fanatics would preach.  Ellison wants to control <br>
by forcing you to use what HE decides you can use.  If all the software is <br>
located on a central server then you only have available what the <br>
administrators want you to use.  Andreeson is just a kid (much akin to <br>
Gates) who saw an opportunity to take advantage of a new technology.  I'm <br>
sure most of you already know, but neither Andreeson nor any of his staff <br>
'invented' the 'browser' nor had anything to do with the development of the <br>
hypertext transport protocol.  Remember also that the hypertext markup <br>
language is just a subset of the much older Standard Generalized Markup <br>
Language.  Netscape is just another Microsoft wannabe.<br>
<p>
Remember also that Apple stole the idea for the 'Mac' from Xerox (just as <br>
MS did) and that Microsoft was one of the first software companies to write <br>
for the Apple OS.  Oh yes, for those who may have forgotten....Apple DID <br>
steal it's BASIC from Microsoft, and originally ran the character based <br>
AppleDOS.<br>
<p>
Ellison runs Oracle.  Oracle's biggest clients are mainframe and huge <br>
mini-computer shops.  Of course he would want you to give up independence <br>
to go back to centralized computer.  That's where he makes his living.<br>
<p>
I remember when Win95 *FINALLY* came out (I beta tested it and remember <br>
calling it WinEVER...never mind the fact that some of the great 'new' <br>
things to *MAYBE* be in MemphisOS WERE in the original Win95 but were <br>
pulled (hard to believe the TCP/IP stack for Windows for Workgroups can do <br>
things Win95 still dreams of...or NT has been doing for years)). <br>
 Anyway....during this time the MacFanatics were proudly posting flyers <br>
that said 'Windows95.....Mac84'.  They thought this was a great slam. <br>
 Though that is essentially true the sad fact is that Mac97 is STILL Mac84. <br>
 Cooperative multitasking, lame AppleTalk, etc, etc.  At least MS saw the <br>
need for a REAL OS and developed NT, and moved into other areas as well.<br>
<p>
Apple's problems stem from the fact that the founders saw the Apple as <br>
'everyman's computer'.  Then they followed the Dilbert Principle and <br>
promoted and hired the least competent to mangers with the most power, <br>
priced their 'everyman computer' into a range only the elite could afford <br>
and smugly sat back sure that Joe Blow would hock his first born to own one <br>
of their Big Brother killers.  They were so unsure of their ability they <br>
refused to even license a third party from making a clone (claims for <br>
quality control don't wash here as a simple clause about having Apple <br>
Certification and Apple not financially responsible for un-certified <br>
machines would suffice).<br>
<p>
Sun Microsystems is Microsoft's current competition.  They have some great <br>
ideas, fantastic products, and more lethal lawyers than OJ.  (Yes, Sun DID <br>
sue a mom and pop shop to have them remove 'Java' from their logo...even <br>
though the logo had been there years before 'Java' was a glint in it's <br>
developer's eyes.  Yes, Sun won the case).  Unfortunately I see signs of <br>
'Dilbert' at Sun.<br>
<p>
Microsoft indeed does NOT always develop the latest greatest advances, but <br>
they sure have supplied those with ability and confidence to do so.  Little <br>
Boy Blue comes along and develops something that is usable (operative word <br>
here...not necessarily bleeding edge orgasmic but USABLE) and MS sees a <br>
profit, they indeed try to buy it.  LBB has the financial backing to say no <br>
then he can do so and may end up making a good profit.  Of course, this <br>
leads MS to say 'OK, but we have programmers and billions in resources...' <br>
so MS just may put LBB out of business.<br>
<p>
Microsoft then is an extropic borganism.  The main thing is to survive. <br>
 The most good for the most people.  Let the small civilizations to the <br>
research, if it's usable absorb and refine it.  Let them survive so you can <br>
profit from the distribution.  Competition is what keeps MS in the <br>
dominating position.<br>
<p>
I do disagree with your Microsoft will destroy itself.  MS will dominate <br>
until Gates dies (I don't think he will retire).  The result will be as the <br>
Empire of Alexander the Great.<br>
