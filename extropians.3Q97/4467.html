<i>&gt; &gt;Pen and paper have not been substantially improved except in quality</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;for the last centuries, but written culture have managed to develop</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;quite nicely.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True, but given *any* technology, it will not likely to improve much,</i><br>
<i>&gt; except a steady increase in quality, or a steady decrease in price.</i><br>
<p>
You are still talking about the technology itself, not what it is<br>
used for. The systems of writing and organizing texts have steadily<br>
improved at an exponential rate even when the paper has not changed<br>
much, today we could (with some concentration) write software for<br>
old PC's that would have been amazing in the old days when they were<br>
originally used (but we have moved to more advanced computers,<br>
allowing our code to bloat - maybe it is not good with a too fast<br>
evolution of the basic medium for the evolution of the applications<br>
we run in it?). <br>
<p>
A technology acting as a medium for other technologies or culture<br>
acts as an amplifier; one could perhaps multiply its "power" with <br>
the power of the things that are run in it. Of course, these things<br>
 can also be medias: the power of a web of information is <br>
[power of computer] x [power of programs] x[power of information], <br>
so as the power of each of these levels increases, the total power <br>
increases much faster. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On the other hand, some modest extensions to the old written</i><br>
<i>&gt; culture, e.g. the Zork stories, required more interactive technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In this case the culture made a quantum leap to a whole new technology.</i><br>
<p>
Was Zork really a modest extension? I would say it was a qualitative<br>
jump, so the need for a new technology was not unreasonable. But<br>
there can also be cultural quantum jumps that doesn't involve new<br>
physical technology, such as the introduction of mind-maps, modern<br>
book indexing (which increases usability immensely) or the introduction<br>
of new notations in science. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But even if a technology is open-ended it is limited (at least today).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you saying that at some point in the future, there will exists</i><br>
<i>&gt; a technology so powerful (i.e. limitless) that it can satisfy everyones</i><br>
<i>&gt; basic need to explore her curiosity and imagination? </i><br>
<p>
Yes. I would say information technology and nanotechnology may be<br>
the most obvious candidates. There will still be limits, but within<br>
these limits the potential for imagination is infinite (OK, let's<br>
ignore the Bekenstein bound for a moment :-).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another possibility would be that imagination is limited.</i><br>
<p>
Now that is a worrying thought! But you are right, the human mind is<br>
finite, so our imagination must also be finite (if large). So this<br>
is yet another reason to transcend. <br>
<p>
More philosophically, imagination is likely not limited since it<br>
can encompass mathematics, and by Gödel's theorem we know mathematics<br>
is not limited - there are always new, unexpected and unprovable<br>
theorems. So there will always be things that can be imagined that<br>
cannot be deduced automatically (finding them may be hard). <br>
