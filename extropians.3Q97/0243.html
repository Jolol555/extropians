<i>&gt;  &gt; consciousness is a product of any logic (not just highly complex</i><br>

<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Logic is simply a set of rules that specify a particular</i><br>
<i>&gt;  behavior.  There must be something physical which implements or</i><br>
<i>&gt;  instantiates or performs this behavior.  I see no reason why logic</i><br>
<i>&gt;  does anything outside of whatever the particular physical phenomenon</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that is performing the logic is directly responsible for.  There must</i><br>
<i>&gt;  be some actual physical phenomenon that is producing the consciousness</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and it is this conscious phenomenon that represents or instantiates or</i><br>
<i>&gt;  performs the logic of our minds.  The conscious phenomenon of our</i><br>
<i>&gt;  minds are able to perform logical operations, it doesn't arise from</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that logic.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe I wasn't very specific about what I meant by logic - I'm using logic as<br>
a term to describe cause and effect.  In it's simplest form it could be a<br>
collision between two solid objects, sending each in different directions.<br>
 Or a simple chemical reaction, at a more complex form it could be our brain,<br>
a collection of these smaller parts.<br>
<p>
Now imagine that every time there's a chemical reaction, or two objects<br>
collide or anything happens where there is an outcome there's a spark of<br>
consciousness.  Every time a reaction occurs it creates conscious thought.<br>
 From this pool of conscii larger conscii start to form, in fact there could<br>
be some sort of evolution taking place that decides what conscii survive and<br>
which fade (a good consciousness being one that becomes aware, as non-aware<br>
consciousness is pointless).<br>
<p>
These smaller conscii could be so inferior that you probably wouldn't call<br>
them conscious at all.  Think of them as sparks being created by gears<br>
churning together, eventually enough of these sparks can create a full blown<br>
consciousness like that of the human mind.  We could also be part of a larger<br>
consciousness, but just as we are not aware of these smaller conscii, or even<br>
each others conscious minds we would not be aware of a higher level<br>
consciousness.<br>
<p>
This is, of course, only an idea.  I can't prove it now just as much as you<br>
cannot prove to me that you are conscious.  I suspect I only developed this<br>
theory because I like the idea of discovering that something we once<br>
treasured as setting us apart, turns out to be one of the most abundant<br>
things in the universe!<br>
<p>
I'd like to take this opportunity to coin the word 'conscii' - if you don't<br>
mind.<br>

My idea was consciousness being created by physical movement.  Whereas memes<br>
are ideas being evolved within the mind.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Now suppose that consciousness is a meme.  And suppose that there are</i><br>
<i>&gt;  different flavors...like the flu....(are you more conscious than Bubba?</i><br>
 Is<br>
<i>&gt;  Bubba even conscious at all? Is Bubba even awake?)</i><br>
<p>
I have thought about consciousness as a learned or evolved phenomenon.<br>
 Prehaps what I am experiencing as consciousness is really just me *thinking*<br>
i'm conscious, and it really never happened at all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  That being stipulated...wouldn't it require a language to transmit</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "consciousness"...or at least some type of meme vector....(TV transmits</i><br>
<i>&gt;  stupidy...is this to much of a stretch?)</i><br>
<p>
You could say that you are not conscious until you are told you are<br>
conscious, after which you look back and say "Oh yeah!  I was conscious all a<br>
long" and therefore can't remember a point where you weren't conscious.  This<br>
could be easily past along.  We would not notice the difference between a<br>
conscious being and a non-conscious being until we ask - of course, as soon<br>
as we explain the question, they're infected and they also think they're<br>
conscious!!<br>
<p>
I prefer the idea that it's something physical and within our grasp.<br>
