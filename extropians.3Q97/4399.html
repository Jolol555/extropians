Anyone can make themselves comfortable with an idea.  The question is what the<br>
instinctive reaction is, and how long it takes thereafter.<br>
<p>
I didn't mean to imply that everyone over a certain age would be left out. <br>
Many people on this list like a Singularity.  I was simply suggesting that my<br>
generation, or the next one, might be more naturally comfortable with the<br>
idea, that it would have less shock value.  In other words, I was saying that<br>
Generation S will go farther... not that "you old fuddy-duddies can't go anywhere".<br>
<p>
I've often wondered whether the next generation's concept of the future will<br>
be to the Singularity what the Singularity is to the domes-and-blasters vision<br>
of the previous generations.  *There* is a thought that even I find<br>
frightening... because I have no conception, no conception at all, about what<br>
that could be.<br>
