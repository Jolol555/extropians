So death - the destruction of the physical type - is the not thing we're<br>
trying to avoid.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;  I agree.</i><br>
<p>
I would define death - the end of all existence type - as being a flaw in<br>
those memories.. a lapse in logic.. the difference between you and me is our<br>
memories.  When my consciousness dies it's because there is nothing to<br>
continue that thread.<br>

<i>&gt;  I grant you that there might be practical advantages in uploading slowly, </i><br>

no <br>

<p>
I'm talking of a technical disadvantage.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;          &gt;if you rebuild your mind in exact detail, you've sort of missed</i><br>
the <br>

<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Slower? The software is the same and the hardware is a billion times</i><br>
faster, <br>
<i>&gt;  why would things be slower?</i><br>
<p>
How many quanta do you need to simulate a quanta?  If you have to simulate<br>
down to the the same scale as the machine operates - quantum simulations on a<br>
quantum computer - the 'original' will be faster, smaller and more efficient<br>
than the simulation.  I'm not saying we need that level of detail.. but I<br>
can't say we won't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;          &gt;The new "you" (the uploaded duplicate) will probably think the</i><br>
same,<br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;but that doesn't change the fact that he/she/it is almost</i><br>
certainly <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;a fake          </i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt;  So just what is it that the "original" (whatever that means) has that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;  "fake" does not, a soul?</i><br>
<p>
Did I say that, doesn't sound like me.. but while I'm here..<br>
<p>
Rather than an original or fake, your 'software self' would just be another<br>
instance of you.  What makes these two instances different?<br>
<p>
Let's say I decide to clone you and all your memories, I make a second<br>
instance of John K. Clark.  Do you share the same consciousness?  I would<br>
think not - it may look like John, it may sound like John, it may even indent<br>
it's quotes like John - but it's not John.  So what makes you different?<br>
 Well, at the exact moment you're cloned the two of you start recieving<br>
different input.  You can't occupy the same space, so you can't share the<br>
same input, and if you did occupy the same space it would make this whole<br>
exercise pointless.  So if the input recieved has to be exactly the same, we<br>
would have to simulate that input to introduce your consciousness to your new<br>
software existence.  If we don't the conscious thread is broken and you're<br>
replaced by an imposter.  So how detailed does that simulation need to be?<br>
<p>
I would think it would have to be correct to the smallest known detail.  It<br>
could be that electrons orbit your atoms at a slightly different speed when<br>
you stand three inches to the left, the reason for this could be the<br>
orginisation of stars in the universe.  So you've got to simulate the atoms,<br>
the electrons, the gravitons, the stars atoms, etc.  Computers can't operate<br>
on a lower level than the smallest known detail, so the simulation would be<br>
slower and less-efficient.<br>
<p>
Having to simulate the universe on a quantum level just to keep your logic<br>
consistent might be over the top.  We have to work out how precise and<br>
consistent our memories need to be to create a perticular consciousness (when<br>
I say 'memories' I'm talking about *all* previous experiences, including<br>
those aspects you can't percieve).  Gradual uploading avoids these questions<br>
- although the version of me with a billion IQ may be nothing like the<br>
current version of me, the trasition between the two was consistent and<br>
that's what makes it 'the original.'<br>
