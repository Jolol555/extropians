I recently saw an announcement that Kevorkian's assistant Janet Good<br>
had died.  I was most struck by the report of an aspect of his belief<br>
system that I might have guessed, but which I found particularly well<br>
put in this excerpt:<br>
<p>
	At [his assistant Janet Good's] funeral, Kevorkian said she had<br>
	surpassed Mother Teresa in her humanity.<br>
<p>
	"Mother Teresa stops short," Kevorkian said. "Mother Teresa<br>
	justifies what she does because of myth. Janet did what she did<br>
	because it was right."<br>
