AFAIR that's not what NASA and the Russians have been saying on the Net. <br>
I could see that perhaps he switched on the automatic system when he<br>
realised that he was about to crash it, but that would still leave the<br>
blame in his hands, not the computer's. <br>

<p>
Not really; Mir has plenty of support, and that's what caused the problem.<br>
A fast relativistic ship couldn't be holed by a transport because no<br>
transport could catch up with it, and it would have to be equipped to<br>
repair itself without external intervention. <br>
