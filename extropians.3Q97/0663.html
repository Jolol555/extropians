<i>&gt;Clothes are both "functional" and social.  [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Beliefs are also both functional and social.  [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For subjects with little social monitoring and strong personal penalties</i><br>
<i>&gt;for incorrect beliefs, we expect the functional role of beliefs to</i><br>
<i>&gt;dominate.  Beliefs about small military missions or small engineering</i><br>
<i>&gt;projects come to mind.  But for subjects with high social interest and</i><br>
<i>&gt;little personal penalty for mistakes, we expect the social role of beliefs</i><br>
<i>&gt;to dominate.  Consider beliefs about large elections or beliefs addressing</i><br>
<i>&gt;abstract philosophical, religious, or scientifc questions. [...]</i><br>
<p>
"Large" or highly public topics like news, sports and politics have the<br>
feature that lots of people (and therefore, probably people you might want<br>
to talk to) have knowledge and opinions about them.  So that makes these<br>
topics Schelling points for conversation topics.  Common ground, but of a<br>
funny sort: you want to agree on the topic but disagree on the opinions<br>
about it, to have a good argument.  And a good argument reinforces your<br>
sense of the importance of the topic, too.<br>
<p>
But the social vs. practical impact is a much clearer explanation of the<br>
same thing.  Of course a high-social, low-practical topic will tend to<br>
become popular, and popularity alone gives a topic social importance.<br>
(And maybe the more cooks, the more spoiled the broth, so popular issues<br>
are less likely to have practical decisions made on them?  Bonus!)<br>
<p>
The social vs. practical comparison answers a question about politics:<br>
Why so much hoopla about such a pointless process?  Because the pointlessness<br>
makes it safe.  In fact it's in the interest of both voters and<br>
representitives to make government good at producing annoyance (stuff<br>
to get angry and argue about) and bad at changing things (practical).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The conflict between the functional and social roles of clothes has become</i><br>
<i>&gt;less of a concern with the invention of new materials and designs, and as</i><br>
<i>&gt;we have become rich enough to move to milder climates.  Similarly, I think</i><br>
<i>&gt;a key to reducing the conflict between the functional and social roles of</i><br>
<i>&gt;beliefs is to better understand both roles, espcially the</i><br>
<i>&gt;academically-neglected social role of beliefs.  [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fortunately, innovation in clothes proceeded even without a deep</i><br>
<i>&gt;understanding of either fabrics or the social and functional roles of</i><br>
<i>&gt;clothes.  Similarly, belief complexes and social institutions have evolved</i><br>
<i>&gt;even without a deep understanding of the nature of computation and of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;social and functional roles of beliefs.  But there is reason to hope that,</i><br>
<i>&gt;as with clothes, such evolution may proceed faster with a deeper</i><br>
<i>&gt;understanding of these issues.</i><br>
<p>
Here's an example that this is happening:<br>
An X-Files T-shirt, with the slogan, "I Want To Believe," is:<br>
  o  an indicator that I'm an independent thinker interested in wacky<br>
     ideas, and<br>
  o  an indicator that I'm a skeptic with some scientific training, and<br>
  o  an ironic meta-comment (maybe showing that people in general are<br>
     becoming more aware) about the social function of belief, and<br>
  o  a damn fine practical piece of clothing.<br>
<p>
In short, a desert topping *and* a floor wax.  I rest my case.<br>
<p>
(Later:)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I agree that the social role of beliefs is also in a sense</i><br>
<i>&gt;"functional", which is why I put this word in quotes in my first</i><br>
<i>&gt;usage.  Perhaps it would have been better to say "social" vs. "non-social"?</i><br>
<p>
The thing I noticed was that you put "maintain privacy"<br>
and "enhance our figures" in the "functional" category.<br>
<p>
Anyway, thanks for a fresh idea!<br>
