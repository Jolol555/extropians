<i>     &gt;With this message I'm launching a debate on NSPIC.</i><br>
<i>     &gt;NSPIC = Neuro-Semantic Political Illusion Complex.</i><br>
<i>     &gt;Later in this message I give a brief description</i><br>
<i>     &gt;of what I mean by NSPIC.</i><br>

     The last time I mentioned Chomsky here I received a peculiar response <br>
     which roughly said that Chomsky's irrelevance stems from his obsession <br>
     with the rest of the world (excluding the USA) which somehow obscured <br>
     what "the people" really should know. Or words to that effect. I <br>
     didn't understand the sentiment behind the statement and found it to <br>
     be rather parochial, narrow and indicative enough of the kind of con <br>
     the US media plays on it's people, without having to add or respond. <br>
     I can't remember who made the response, but I'm still curious.<br>
     The film "Manufacturing Consent" seems somehow relevant to the NSPIC <br>
     antiparadigm. (There should be a term for what is produced by <br>
     reinventing the wheel, if there is I can't seem to remember it) In it <br>
     there is quite specific discussion of how information is currently <br>
     controlled - with particular reference to two minute news articles and <br>
     the difficulty of allowing alternative viewpoints into discussion due <br>
     to restrictive time. <br>
     <br>
     Whenever a new ongoing protest hits the news the first article will <br>
     include the opening argument. From there we receive little more than a <br>
     bodycount. The argument hasn't stopped, nor has it been merely <br>
     replaced with bloodshed, it continues to be developed but fast becomes <br>
     too complex to be accounted within the two minute structure.<br>
     <br>
     BTW, I'm not interested in what Chomsky has to say because he's <br>
     particularly pro or anti US. I'm interested in him because he is a <br>
     celebrated and imaginative linguist and a true scholar. The connection <br>
     between linguistics and the media seems rather obvious to me.<br>

     What is the point of listing the various manifestations of the <br>
     illusion of the state? If you can get clear about this: The entire <br>
     world is an anarchist state. The man with a gun pointing at the border <br>
     is all the state ever was or could be. "Democracy" invites the <br>
     neccessity to manufacture consent. As every human action is first <br>
     generated in the imagination, it would take nothing short of the <br>
     mechanization of the imagination to alter the status quo: the entire <br>
     world is anarchist.<br>
     <br>
     If you believe the state is a problem then you are part of the <br>
     problem, because you believe in the state.<br>

     Do what thou wilt is the whole of the law.<br>
