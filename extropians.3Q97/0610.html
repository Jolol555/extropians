I think the original case at issue was of a small baby who, unfortunately,<br>
does not have the wherewithal of "responsibility."  <br>

You shouldn't!  I certainly don't. Yet, it takes time to learn about a<br>
medical problem I have, to research it and get multiple opinions.  Same with<br>
law.  In order to understand the jargon, I need to study law to a degree in<br>
order to understand the negotiations of the contracts.  I did study law to<br>
at least get some kind of certification. Otherwise, I would be at a loss.<br>
Although I might be willing to take the extra time and effort to do this,<br>
not everyone is.  And, even with this, my experience is limited and I would<br>
appear weak in light of a serious negotiation.<br>
<p>
I would rather spend the time to find a smart carpenter who will make the<br>
structure I want, rather than do it myself because I don't want to -;)<br>
<p>
As for being a *thinking* person and making decisions, no one can or should<br>
make them for me but me.  I'm not sure of the protocol, but I think that in<br>
order to have a sex change operation, one needs to have psychological<br>
evaluations. I have never done this, obviously, so I don't know what it is<br>
about.  It does concern me because I don't know how libertarian the tests<br>
are. I would venture to say that it would be advantageous to know because<br>
the tests probably determine if a person can have the sex change to change<br>
genders.  <br>
