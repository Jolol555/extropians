In this respects our upbringings were similar.  From the age of 6, I had<br>
unrestricted access to my parent's library, including bodice-rippers, war<br>
stories (often with gruesome pictures), and my (psychologist) mother's<br>
collections of texts on human sexuality.  Indeed, they even assisted the<br>
education process.  When my baby brother was born (I was 4) they got me a<br>
picture book with stylized but still graphic illustrations of sex, adult<br>
human genitalia, and childbirth.  They would never have made a scene to get<br>
me a copy of de Sade, but that's only because they're not the type to make a<br>
scene.<br>
<p>
They did hide the pornography, but I found it anyway :-)  I personally<br>
wouldn't care if a child of my own saw any, because I remember my reaction<br>
(pre-puberty) was "what's the big deal?"<br>
