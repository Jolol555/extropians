Virtually all human beings would instinctively agree that defense against<br>
aggression is not wrong. This is evidenced by the fact that the contrary<br>
instinct, i.e. defense is immoral, would be anti-survival.<br>
<p>
Still, this could mean that defense is either moral or amoral. In non-human<br>
context, we would probably deem defense to be *amoral*. In human context,<br>
however, it is in the interests of the vast majority to make a personal<br>
moral choice to the effect that proportionate defense against aggression is<br>
*moral* and thus aggressive behavior which elicits a defensive response is<br>
*immoral*.<br>
<p>
I call this choice the "primethic" decision.<br>
<p>
The primethic decision establishes the basis for both "rights" and<br>
"morality" since to deem defense against aggression, in the human context,<br>
to be *amoral* is to deny the *existance* of both rights and morality. If<br>
defense against aggression is amoral, then aggression which elicits a<br>
defensive response must necessarily be amoral. The personal moral choice to<br>
be made, then, is *rights/morality* or *no-rights/amorality*.<br>
<p>
If these, in fact, are the only two choices, then my proportionate defense<br>
against aggression is, from my point of view, moral, and from the<br>
aggressor's point of view, either moral or amoral. Either way, such defense<br>
*imposes* nothing on the aggressor. That is to say, proportionate defense is<br>
not, even from the aggressor's point of view, an immoral aggression.<br>
