<i>&gt; &gt; I spent all these years thinking that people who fell into a black</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; This explanation is great!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Kennita (still dazzled by the light bulb going on over her head :-) )</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Um, no.  Actually, you would be simultaneously crushed and torn about.  As you</i><br>
<i>&gt; got close to the singularity, assuming you headed in feet first, the atoms in</i><br>
<i>&gt; your feet would be torn away and crushed into an infinitely dense point.  Then</i><br>
<i>&gt; the atoms in your knees.  And so on.  You get torn apart from the feet up, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; the loose parts get compacted again.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Probably before that, your head and feet would get ripped off, heading in on</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own time.  Before you start disintegrating, that is.  You're kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; being squeezed from one direction and torn apart from the other.  Drop a bit</i><br>
<i>&gt; of liquid into a black hole and it assumes an egg shape that rapidly becomes</i><br>
<i>&gt; very long and thin, until it finally becomes a cone of atoms and quarks</i><br>
<i>&gt; funneling into a point.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I also seem to recall that the tidal forces wouldn't become strong enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; until the last 4 seconds or so... so enjoy the view.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Got it?</i><br>

I wonder how, if at all, this result varies depending on the mass<br>
of the black hole and its movement relative to the observer. <br>
What if a particle, say a neutron, that was moving very fast -so<br>
close to the speed of light that it's mass was equal to the<br>
earth's mass -were to hit the earth dead center?  Would the<br>
particle just pass on through?  Or would it hit other particles,<br>
which in turn would hit more (other) particles, to such an extent<br>
that the earth would be destroyed?  Would there be an "entry<br>
wound" and an "exit wound?"  What if the particle were moving so<br>
fast that its mass were 1 solar mass?  5 solar masses?<br>
