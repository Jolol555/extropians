All very valid.  I think the fundamental problem is that we form concepts by<br>
finding similarities between exemplars of the properties.  We don't really<br>
think in terms of definitions.  As a result, dictionary definitions end up<br>
fundamentally circular, even though our concepts aren't.  To fully transmit a<br>
concept to somebody, you'd have to transmit all the experiences with which<br>
you created a concept.  Obviously that's a no-go.  Usually we share enough<br>
experiences that just a definition or analogy will suffice.  With<br>
higher-level concepts (and "exists" is a whopper) there's so much experience<br>
behind the concept that such methods don't always cut the mustard.  Our<br>
disagreement here may fall into the category.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;By itself a dictionary is nothing but one big circular definition.    </i><br>
<i>&gt;All the definitions in a dictionary are made of words, and those words also </i><br>
<i>&gt;have definitions made of other words also in the dictionary, and round and </i><br>
<i>&gt;round we go. The way out of this paradox is the fact that much, perhaps</i><br>
most,<br>
<i>&gt;of our knowledge in not in the dictionary because it's not made of words.</i><br>
<p>
We seem to agree on this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You're saying that The Mandelbrot set does not exist because it's too</i><br>
complex, <br>
<i>&gt;only simple cartoon like things can be real. Well OK, but then who needs to </i><br>
<i>&gt;be "real"?  It would seem that possessing the quality of "reality" is not </i><br>
<i>&gt;desirable.</i><br>
<p>
Well, no, incredibly complex things exist (anything living, for starters).<br>
 The Mandelbrot set, however, requires infinite complexity.  That's quite a<br>
tall order.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We can know something about the Mandelbrot set, we just can't know</i><br>
everything. <br>
<i>&gt;How is that different from a chair?</i><br>
<p>
As I said, without humans, the Virgo cluster would still be here.  (I'm going<br>
to slide away from chairs because as human devices they don't fit this<br>
counterfactual)  But the Mandelbrot set wouldn't; it's only in our heads and<br>
computers.  Our heads and computers don't even have that; they have finite<br>
approximations of it, and an equation which can generate it, which given an<br>
aleph-one infinity time and storage (I'll assume that's the cardinality of a<br>
line).  But we don't have that much time or storage.<br>
<p>
Now, to be fair, there are alternate meanings for "exist".  For example, the<br>
Mandelbrot set "exists" in a way that the rational square root of 2 doesn't.<br>
 The finite-operation squared circle doesn't "exist", but the squared circle<br>
does "exist" in the same way as the Mandelbrot set (possible with an infinite<br>
number of operations).  I do find my meaning more handy, but to be precise<br>
would require inventing more words.<br>
