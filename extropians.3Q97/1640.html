     Really clearing-out bad apples constantly [those overtly or<br>
covertly defending the special interests] by ballyhooing their<br>
membership in Establishment funded Prestige Associations like the CFR,<br>
etc. conspiracy style would be beneficial from a libertarian<br>
perspective.  The stability of the Statist power structure would be<br>
disrupted, giving the private sector more opportunity to grow and<br>
expand.  However, this would require substantial growth of the<br>
conspiracy culture.  Right now, conspiracy thinking produces nothing<br>
more than a little grumbling.  Even better, the policy power of the CFR,<br>
etc. would be undermined if attention could be focused on their real<br>
policy agendas and agents.  Their association with a policy could be the<br>
kiss of death.<br>
<p>
    And, of course, not all conspiracy theories are equal from the<br>
standpoint of withering the State.  Nazi, Fascist, Socialist, and<br>
Communist conspiracy theorists are certainly not my favorites, for<br>
instance.  They couch their theories in the context of their special<br>
Statist solutions.  On the other hand, there is libertarian ruling<br>
class/conspiracy theory as promoted by the now deceased Murray Rothbard,<br>
Sam Konkin, or me.  The populist theoris aren't perfect, but aren't too<br>
bad.  Bircher theories are great on economics though often Nationalistic<br>
and anti-personal freedom (drugs).<br>
<p>
    For instance, libertarian conspiracy theory see the "govt regulation<br>
is good meme" as a meme spread by high order Establishment entities to<br>
create the climate necessary for their multifarous Statist<br>
interventions.....sophisticated conspiracy theories fight ideas as<br>
instruments of conspiracies as much as individuals or groups.  Meme<br>
theory tells us, though, that ideas are associated with groups.  Ideas,<br>
as memes, are what create groups or cultures.  The battle of ideas is<br>
necessarily a battle of groups at the same time.  However, groups can be<br>
and often are destroyed by destroying their memes.  Contrary to the<br>
Nazis and the Catholic Church (heretic burning) groups can be destroyed<br>
without killing the individuals involved.<br>
