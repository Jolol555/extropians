<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, in spite of my own emotional involvement, I can't see the difference</i><br>

<i>&gt; various communist country's right up to this moment (China - N-korea).</i><br>
<p>
Truth is, I don't know.  I've only seen documentaries on the Holocaust, not<br>
any of the other genocides.  But from the bits and pieces I've picked up, I<br>
get the impression that people were starved, or killed, or tortured briefly,<br>
but not all of the above for months before death.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;I wouldn't argue with anyone who called Chad, Cambodia, or a crack ghetto a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;"continuing Holocaust".  Far from mocking the dead, this would prevent</i><br>
<i>&gt; similar</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;tragedies.  Nor would I argue if someone wanted to add a fourth floor to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Holocaust exhibition, documenting ongoing genocides around the world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, there's a good, contructive, idea! This is an Exibition in the US? or</i><br>
<i>&gt; somewhere else?</i><br>
<p>
Washington D.C.  It's the "Holocaust Museum".  I don't know whether the<br>
Permanent Exhibition is taking more floors, but you could probably get an<br>
additional exhibition added if enough people demanded it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;But, as human history demonstrates, genocide was once as fashionable as</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;theories of racial superiority. If not for the Holocaust, we might today</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;cheerfully dismiss Chad and Cambodia as the extinction of vermin.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I sure as hell would not!</i><br>
<i>&gt; And I can only hope that you would not either, you're much to smart to such</i><br>
<i>&gt; a thing anyway.</i><br>
<p>
I hope I wouldn't.  There's no way I can be sure.  If I'd grown up in the<br>
beginning of the 20th century, I might.  If in the beginning of the 19th<br>
century, I might think slavery was a fine idea.  There's no *instinct* that<br>
acts against such ideas.  Quite the contrary.  Even I am not arrogant enough<br>
to assume that I, through sheer logic and innate moral superiority, could<br>
duplicate a hundred years of hard-earned experience.<br>
<p>
Someone once tried to tell me that killing was inherently abhorrent.  Another<br>
quote I ran across, from "Mindkiller", stated that too many people of the<br>
video generation are convinced they have what it takes to kill in cold blood. <br>
Perhaps I'm from the video generation, then, but it seems to me that<br>
civilization is a thin veneer over basic human nature, and basic human nature<br>
has no problem with killing at all.  I hope I never need to kill anyone, but<br>
if I have to, I don't think that doing so would be either difficult or<br>
traumatic.  Uncouple civilized restraints and killing would barely ripple the<br>
emotional surface of the mind.  Still, I could be wrong.  With luck, time will<br>
never tell.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;By</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;associating something not instinctively abhorrent, genocide, with something</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;that is instinctively abhorrent, torture, the Holocaust made genocide as</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;unfashionable as theories of racial superiority.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Both may be unfashionable in your neighborhood, racial theories still kill,</i><br>
<i>&gt; asks any Rwandese genocide victim. this happened just a few years ago! in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the nineties! It's not over folks, it's just not being covered so extensively.</i><br>
<p>
Whose point did you think this proves?  If genocide were inherently abhorrent,<br>
it wouldn't happen so often.  It took the Holocaust, which is inherently<br>
abhorrent, to create our modern taboo against it.<br>
<p>
Perhaps that very taboo is responsible for our refusal to acknowledge the<br>
lesser genocides.  Still, we do try to stop them - although not with enough force.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;But, speaking as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;human, we are simply not sensitive to the deaths of people we don't know.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;It provokes no instinctive reaction in us.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm sorry here we have a most serious disagreement (*most* serious).</i><br>
<i>&gt; But maybe you've never seen someone die. I hope you won't ever have to,</i><br>
<i>&gt; even though it is quite a learning experience (beats years of university,</i><br>
<i>&gt; hand down)</i><br>
<p>
I was speaking of seeing it in the morning newspapers, not seeing it in<br>
person.  More on this a bit later, I'm developing a theory here...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I appreciate that the exibition shocked the hell out of you, that is not a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bad thing, it merely shows you're human (Sorry Anders).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe I'm different but those images have not 'overloaded' my responses</i><br>
<i>&gt; since I was ten. Seeing the UN do nothing for several years whilst women</i><br>
<i>&gt; and children were being shelled with artillery got me pretty pissed though.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Seeing a little boy die from sniperfire (no not on TV!) damm-near did the job.</i><br>
<p>
Of course, being a victim of genocide is inherently abhorrent.  Committing<br>
genocide is what fails to bother us.  Likewise, watching it happen to other<br>
people doesn't cause you innate discomfort, it violates a taboo you have<br>
against genocide.  This taboo is no more and no less arbitrary than our taboo<br>
against cannibalism, emotionally speaking.  It simply happens to have more<br>
powerful ethical support.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Eliezer, in other coutry's persons you're age are seasoned veterans of some</i><br>
<i>&gt; pointless civil-war, they have *done* the kind of things you get overloaded</i><br>
<i>&gt; by just looking at pictures of them.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Read some contemporary history, and hold-on to someone you love while</i><br>
<i>&gt; you're at it. It helps.</i><br>
<p>
I've read about Vietnam in "From The Jaws Of History".  Evidently the taboo is<br>
only against seeing other countries commit genocide.<br>
<p>
I wasn't around in 1945, but if the Nazis had simply shot everyone instead of<br>
torturing them, the world might have shrugged.  The torture invoked the<br>
compassion that created the taboo against genocide.<br>
<p>
Perhaps someone with no taboo against genocide, given a live tour of a modern<br>
genocide, would react as strongly as someone walking through the Holocaust<br>
Museum.  Or, if their sympathies were on the other side, they might join in. <br>
That's the way our minds work, sadly enough.  While I hope that a horrible<br>
racist, forced to view the Holocaust Museum (not even forced to tour a<br>
concentration camp!), would react with instinctive revulsion.  The Nazi guards<br>
simply tuned it out or enjoyed it, but hopefully in a Museum, with no<br>
distractions and no chance to actually bully someone, the other emotions would<br>
kick in.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I'm wandering a bit far from both my area of knowledge and the<br>
original subject.  It's possible that there are genocides just as bad as the<br>
Holocaust going on even as I waste time typing, and I refuse to acknowledge it<br>
simply because of my taboo against genocide.  That's the way taboos work,<br>
after all.<br>
<p>
I once compared crack ghettos to the Holocaust, and I retain that comparision<br>
after walking through the Holocaust Museum, even though I've only read text<br>
descriptions of a crack ghetto, even though no deliberate genocide is being<br>
planned.  Neurological havoc can easily cause as much or more suffering as<br>
physical torture.  Maybe that's why I acknowledge the problem; no deliberate<br>
genocide, so it doesn't violate my taboo.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I'm not really sure what we're arguing about.  Regardless of whether<br>
modern genocides are as bad as the Holocaust, we both think they're not good.<br>
<p>
I'll handle the ghettos if you handle Cambodia.  Deal?<br>
