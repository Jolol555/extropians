<i>&gt;&gt; LDC: </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Those who use the term "ideologue" as derogatory--and there are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; many--do not oppose only those ideologies imposed by fear or used to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; control others.  They hold equal disdain for reasoned ideologies and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ideologies opposed to control.  I have been called an ideologue in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; dergoatory sense more than once for being a free-speech absolutist,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; for example.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; RH:</i><br>
<i>&gt; I use the term "ideologue" as derogatory because it connotes for me</i><br>
<i>&gt; people who are far more sure of their beliefs than a rational person</i><br>
<i>&gt; should be.  I also agree with Kathyrn that thinking in terms of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "enemy" is correlated with ideologues, not to their credit.</i><br>
<p>
The issue is how Richter, in the original quotation, defines it, and<br>
how most people who say things like that define it.  You, Robin, are<br>
capable of reasoned argument, and I have no doubt that you have solid<br>
reasons to disdain those you call "ideologues"--although you should<br>
call them something that agrees better with a common dictionary.  The<br>
word for what you describe is "fanatic"--"ideologue" does not have the<br>
meaning you assign to it /except/ among those like Richter, and the<br>
fact that it has evolved that connotation is precisely because of what<br>
I claim; that those people really do have no respect for ideology, in<br>
its normal denotative dictionary meaning.  They should not be charitably<br>
interpreted as opposing only fanaticism, because their opposition to<br>
ideology is dangerous and should be exposed and countered.<br>
