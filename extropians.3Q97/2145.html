<i>&gt; I don't understand why I am now reading comments on this list</i><br>
<i>&gt; implying that I did something impolitic by not having been in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; room when someone brought up my name. </i><br>
<p>
No one questioned your right to be absent; you were simply missed.<br>
While those of us who were in the room had to stay awake though<br>
half an hour or more of Sharon Presley's fact-free and imagination-<br>
free egalitarian drivel, I know I wasn't the only one in the room<br>
longing for comments from someone actually capable of independent<br>
thinking on the matter, such as you.  It is indeed unusual for a<br>
panelist in such a discussion to call upon an audience member by<br>
name (it happened two other times at E3 if I remember), but I for<br>
one could feel the starvation for intellectual stimulation in the<br>
room during that panel, and would have welcomed anyone with ideas,<br>
even bad ones.<br>
<p>
The only entertaining pieces of that hour were Max and Natasha, who<br>
talked about rewiring orgasms to activities other than sex (Max said<br>
he'd like to get off on writing--literally), and having genitals<br>
designed by artists (too bad M.C.Escher is dead--I'd like to rise<br>
indefinitely like one of his staircases).<br>
