Robin Hanson:<br>
<i>&gt;I find it hard to believe that most social institutions</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be very threatened, since I don't think their alternatives</i><br>
<i>&gt;typically depend much on gender, but I'm open to being convinced.</i><br>
<p>
I am sorry that you believe that I am unable to answer your question, <br>
and I have tried in every manner that I know how to do so, and as I <br>
mentioned in my other post, I am really unable to continue this at <br>
this time.<br>
<p>
I think, also, from your above statement, that you think that I am <br>
trying to say that to reveal the construction of gender will topple <br>
all social institution, and I do not know how you would have surmised <br>
that from anything that I have written, as I never claimed that.  I <br>
was talking about enforcement mechanisms that relate to the points at <br>
which gender affects each social institution.  <br>
