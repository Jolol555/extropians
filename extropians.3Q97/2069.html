I tried one of those "air walker" exercises at a little store in town.<br>
You basically put your feet on a pair of steps which are attached to<br>
free swinging bars which are suspended from a waist-high frame.  Then you<br>
swing your legs forward and back.<br>
<p>
I didn't like it much.  The motion did not feel natural, and while you<br>
can adjust the resistance, it didn't seem like it would build up the<br>
muscles you use in daily life.  It was smooth, though, so if you have<br>
joint problems and can't take walking this could be an alternative.<br>
