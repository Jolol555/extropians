<i>&gt;Long answer:</i><br>
<i>&gt;"The untrained man reads a paper on natural science and thinks: </i><br>
<i>&gt;`Now why couldn't he explain this in simple language.'  He can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;seem to realize that what he tried to read was the simplest</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible language - for that subject matter.  In fact, a great </i><br>
<i>&gt;deal of natural philosophy is simply a process of linguistic</i><br>
<i>&gt;simplification - an effort to invent languages in which half</i><br>
<i>&gt;a page of equations can express an idea which could not be stated</i><br>
<i>&gt;in less than a thousand pages of so-called `simple' language."</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Thon Taddeo in _A Canticle for Leibowitz_ by Walter Miller, 1959)</i><br>

I've had this same debate with many people. I've been accused of using big<br>
words and expressing myself in a "complicated" manner, but in reality, I was<br>
being as precise as possible. The question is, what's better, precision or<br>
"easiness". If scientists related everything by metaphor, as the layman<br>
seems to require, scientific writings would be far longer and *less*<br>
precise, and no doubt harder to understand.<br>
