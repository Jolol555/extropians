Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt; responded:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Some philosophers would argue that it is impossible for someone to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be mistaken about the nature of his perceptions, but I disagree.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; a hallucinator thinks he is seeing a purer red than he has ever seen</i><br>
<i>&gt; before, it could be that in some sense the red is actually the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; as what he has always seen, but that part of his mind which judges</i><br>
<i>&gt; purity is not working properly.  Similarly, if he thinks he is</i><br>
<i>&gt; seeing a mandala of infinite fractal complexity, and is</i><br>
<i>&gt; simultaneously perceiving every minute detail far beyond the</i><br>
<i>&gt; resolution he is normally capable of, again I would suggest that he</i><br>
<i>&gt; may be simply misjudging how much detail he is actually perceiving.</i><br>
<p>
	Some of this might be right but there must be some level where<br>
things just are.  For example, we don't really "judge" that a basket<br>
ball is larger than a pea.  Our representation of a basketball simply<br>
takes up much more space in our 3D visual field than a pea does and<br>
that is how we just know that it is larger.  We don't have to make<br>
calculations, measurements to compare, or judge anything... one is<br>
just larger in our conscious awareness than the other.  Drugs may even<br>
effect our memory of such but if something is larger in our<br>
consciousness than something else, then it is larger, no judging that<br>
can be mistaken about it.<br>
