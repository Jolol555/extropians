<p>
Yeah, but people screw this usage up all the time because thermic<br>
energy is not something that can be directly sensed without knowledge<br>
of specific heat of the substance you are touching with your skin<br>
(and knowledge of the temperature of your fingers or whatever you're<br>
using as a thermal sensor).  What we feel is the rate of heat<br>
conduction across our skins, plus incident infrared radiation and<br>
absorbed light, and that relates only messily and incompletely to<br>
what modern thermodynamicists call "heat" in the strict sense.<br>
Caloric lives on in human nervous systems, lurking in the currents<br>
of "common sense".<br>
<p>
It's a bit like trying to translate candelas into watts, or watts<br>
into candelas.  Candelas really are just measuring power, like<br>
watts, but power seen through a inverted-U shaped filter that looks<br>
only at the visible wavelengths of the full photonic spectrum.<br>
Likewise, our current bodies only pick up on some of the phenomena<br>
of heat, and we manage to piece together concepts of the "physical<br>
reality" going on behind our sensorium. That real historical progress<br>
is possible in this process of piecing together and testing our<br>
perceptual filters and models of the world has always fascinated<br>
me, and is still rather mysterious to me.<br>

<i> &gt; On this list, people often seem to use the word "complexity" to</i><br>
<i> &gt; mean:" system which I happen to find intellectually interesting".</i><br>
<i> &gt; The people who do this then ususally assume without argument that</i><br>
<i> &gt; the post-singularity future will be extremely complex in this sense.</i><br>
<p>
One of the functions of gray-goo stories is to remind people<br>
that we have no guarantee that the future will be very<br>
interesting. I find that rather motivating. It's one of the<br>
things that keeps my optimism dynamic rather than static.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; In my opinion, that is a possibility; but it is also very possible</i><br>
<i> &gt; that it won't be, even if we assume that some form of highly</i><br>
<i> &gt; intelligent life survives. We should be on our guard against possible</i><br>
<i> &gt; biases that might make us inclined to believe in something just</i><br>
<i> &gt; because it would be interesting it it were so. (Is this bias toward</i><br>
<i> &gt; intellectual interestingness our equivalent to emotional biases</i><br>
<i> &gt; more prominent in other groups?)</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that's a very interesting question.  ;^)<br>
