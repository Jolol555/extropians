<p>
Alow me to offer two plugs for further memetic development:<br>
<p>
Medicine:<br>
I was thinking about cheap medicine produced in the milk of<br>
genetically-engineered cows/sheep. Making the first cow is of course <br>
very complex and expensive. But once you have a working model they <br>
reproduce themselves (well almost ;-). This is the kind of technology <br>
that can be implemented *today* (we have a prototype bull here in <br>
Holland) and be put to work at very low cost in third-world countries,<br>
requiring only a simple infrastucture and little knowledge from the <br>
endusers. Millions of lives could be saved at only minimal cost to <br>
all of us (the reseach would pay for itself problably, we need <br>
medicine too). IMHO this is the kind of technology that should be <br>
invested in heavily. It also needs more political support<br>
(bio-tech is still tricky)<br>
<p>
Transport:<br>
Some very different (but just as exiting) is the revival of the airship as<br>
a means of long-range, heavy-lifting, large volume means of transportation.<br>
With modern materials and contruction techniques airships can be cheap<br>
(once mass-produced), fuel-efficient (with all that surface you can think<br>
of solarpanels to drive electrical engines, giving unlimited range) and<br>
easier to operate than compareble means of transport. The fact that an<br>
airship does not need a landingstrip (just a pole to attach it to) and<br>
hardly any additional infrastructure makes it ideal for less-developed<br>
country's.<br>
Airships can be made very large (look at the Hindenburg - built with '30s<br>
technology!) and would be able to lift an entire factory from a<br>
contruction-site in France and fly it to central Africa were it could be<br>
delivered to the exact spot of operation.<br>
<p>
Of course they would be filled with helium instead of hydrogen, we'll use<br>
the hydrogen as fuel.<br>
<p>
I also see great possibilities in the tourist industry, why go on a bus<br>
from Holland to Spain if you can fly in an airship wich has all the<br>
comforts of a modern shoppingmall? Once oilprices start to rise (The DOE -<br>
US Department Of Energy - expects this within 10 years) jets will become<br>
very expensive to operate. Airships are also quiet so they could deliver<br>
passengers and good directly to city-centers (just use a big tower that<br>
they can connect to). This will relieve traffic jams, reducing smog and<br>
loss of productive hours.<br>
<p>
I'm not talking about 80-foot blimps here. I'm talking fully rigid 500-foot<br>
commercial airships to fulfil our passenger and cargo transport needs<br>
untill we can beam ourselves to were we want to go.<br>
<p>
Besides, I've always wanted to fly in one of those things ;-)<br>
There is currently a project going on in Holland to set up a<br>
airship-factory. The first commercially viable airship would cost about $70<br>
million and be able to carry 500 passangers in comfort compareble to an<br>
ocean-liner. I think a boeing 747 is about $250 million. The price would<br>
drop once mass-production starts. Airships would have very low operating<br>
costs compared to planes wich would more than compensate for their lower<br>
speed, especially on distances up to 2000 Km's<br>
<p>
I'll try to get more info on this.<br>
