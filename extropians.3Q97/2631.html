Curious how the child - the `son', or more accurately twin brother -<br>
abruptly becomes an `it' in this thought-experiment.  I'd had the<br>
impression that extropians were by choice and principle averse to killing<br>
other human beings whenever they felt like doing so, or just because, and<br>
in the absence of a lethal threat from that other human person, it was to<br>
their advantage.<br>
<p>
And while I'm being sanctimonious, preachy and politically correct, I<br>
suppose I might as well add that I detest the suggestion that evil,<br>
rampaging, mother-fucking nanites should henceforth be coded as `black<br>
goo'.  Are people here *really* so deaf to the coded and offensive<br>
implications?  Here's an alternative - I know it's not as neat as<br>
spectrum-coding, but what about `war goo'?  Uber-goo is not a colour, after<br>
all...<br>
