I missed the earlier reference, but this was a neat web page.  I liked<br>
the chart showing the relationship between different mathematical objects.<br>
It would be great as a large-format wall chart.  This guy, "Mad Max" Tegmark,<br>
has some pretty cool physics stuff on his home page, too.<br>
<p>
One problem I have with Anthropic Principle reasoning is the claim<br>
that atoms and molecules much as we know them are necessary for life.<br>
I don't see how we can a priori rule out possible stable structures of<br>
others kinds.  Even in our own universe, it could be that an earlier or<br>
later epoch would allow the existence of life in a totally different way.<br>
We, who seriously consider the Moravec/Tipler picture of transforming<br>
ourselves into standing waves during the collapse of the universe,<br>
cannot be too confident that life depends on atoms.<br>
<p>
Even if we do grant that atoms are necessary, there is inevitably going to<br>
be some "slop" in the physical constants which will allow life-supporting<br>
universes.  Maybe they will have to fall into a narrow range, but there<br>
will be *some* variability possible.  So all the AP can really do is to<br>
reduce the magnitude of the problem.  The essential mystery will remain:<br>
are there infinite universes, most of which have no life?  Is there just<br>
one, and somehow it was created in the preferred state where life can<br>
evolve?  I think there is a substantial issue here even accepting the AP.<br>

P.S. Here is an abstract from another of Tegmark's papers on his site:<br>
<p>
"At first sight, an accurate description of the state of the universe<br>
appears to require a mind-bogglingly large and perhaps even infinite<br>
amount of information, even if we restrict our attention to a small<br>
subsystem such as a rabbit. In this paper, it is suggested that most<br>
of this information is merely apparent, as seen from our subjective<br>
viewpoints, and that the algorithmic information content of the universe<br>
as a whole is close to zero. It is argued that if the Schrödinger<br>
equation is universally valid, then decoherence together with the<br>
standard chaotic behavior of certain non-linear systems will make the<br>
universe appear extremely complex to any self-aware subsets that happen<br>
to inhabit it now, even if it was in a quite simple state shortly after<br>
the big bang. For instance, gravitational instability would amplify the<br>
microscopic primordial density fluctuations that are required by the<br>
Heisenberg uncertainty principle into quite macroscopic inhomogeneities,<br>
forcing the current wavefunction of the universe to contain such Byzantine<br>
superpositions as our planet being in many macroscopically different<br>
places at once.  Since decoherence bars us from experiencing more than<br>
one macroscopic reality, we would see seemingly complex constellations of<br>
stars etc, even if the initial wavefunction of the universe was perfectly<br>
homogeneous and isotropic."<br>
