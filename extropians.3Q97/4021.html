A very interesting post.<br>
Summary of the post: The responsible IRS official, in testimony before<br>
       congress, admitted that the IRS has no workable plan to<br>
       fix the year 2000 problem in their massive code base.<br>
<p>
The part of the post that attempted to decode some of this<br>
testimony was far too mild and forgiving in three respects:<br>
<p>
1) When the testimony discussed the lask of an "inventory"<br>
and the lack of code documentation, the analysis assumed that<br>
the IRS could at least find the source code. Frankly, I suspect<br>
that they are running some programs for which the source code<br>
in unavailable, or almost as bad, for which the precise method<br>
for building the object from the source has been lost.<br>
<p>
2)The analysis does not question the date given in the testimony<br>
which the softwre problems occur: July 1999. I strongly suspect<br>
that there are "future date" fields which will need the correct<br>
value of 2000 or later, but which must be entered into the systems<br>
starting next year. Further, I strongly suspect that some<br>
of the IRS systems are coded such that the number "99" is a<br>
special-case marker meaning "don't know" or "don't care" or<br>
"infinity". This was a standard COBOL coding practice.<br>
<p>
3) The analysis notes that the IRS's "plan" to award a<br>
contract to one or more large firms to fix the problem<br>
is a fantasy. The "plan" calls for contract award in<br>
October 1998 for delivery of a new system in July 1999.<br>
The analysis notes that this allows 8 months to complete<br>
62 million man-days of programmer effort. In truth, the<br>
real problem is much worse, since There would be a<br>
considerable lag from the time of contract award until the<br>
timethe project could be organized. (The 62 million man-day<br>
estimate is my own, based on the 62 million lines of source code<br>
given in the article.)<br>
