Exploited how?  Is fraud being committed?  If so, wouldn't existing<br>
fraud law be a better tool to use against these people than<br>
regulations that obstruct the innocent business relationships of<br>
older and more sophisticated people who are not engaging in fraud?<br>
If fraud is *not* being committed, then perhaps I may once again<br>
trouble you by asking you for specifics?  Perhaps an example or<br>
two?<br>
<p>

<i> &gt; human rights abuses.</i><br>
<p>
Strong words.  Perhaps you might mention which human rights are<br>
being abused in these cases.  But why should these situations be<br>
the concern of the federal government?  Might not these situations<br>
be handled better at the state level?  I'm just troubled by your<br>
mention of the US Dept of Labor and the IRS, without a thought for<br>
the responsibility of the states to operate against crimes in their<br>
territories.  Only I'm not sure which crimes are being committed,<br>
because although you hinted heavily that crimes were being committed,<br>
you didn't actually name any (except slavery, which these purported<br>
misdeeds only "approach").<br>
<p>
I am troubled by my use of the word "situations" above.  But I find<br>
I have no recourse to any other word, because your hints have no<br>
substance behind them.  There are these unpleasant *situations*,<br>
don't you know, which can't be named or even described in detail,<br>
and it's because of these that the IRS must harrass corporations<br>
in Silicon Valley who hire contractors for terms longer than 18<br>
months.  There's a specific example of how these "situations" and<br>
the regulations that are supposed to redress them affect my life.<br>
I have a rather comfortable contract right now, a potentially<br>
long-term one, but I just recently found out that my client will<br>
have to give me the heave-ho after 18 months, willy-nilly, or suffer<br>
from IRS persecution.  How this helps the poor innocent children<br>
who are being exploited in Oklahoma (or whatever you are vaguely<br>
hinting at, Mr. Genen), I have no idea.<br>
