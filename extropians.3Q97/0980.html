<i>&gt;  &gt; For a rerun to occur (a being that develops so similar to yourself it</i><br>

every<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; detail up to the point of your death (so that the being has the same</i><br>
memories<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; and 'thinks' it is you).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Not at all, you could be created "from scratch" as an exact match of your</i><br>
<i>&gt;  current body/mind.  There is no reason why the surrounding world would</i><br>
have<br>
<i>&gt;  to match.  You would experience a discontinuity if the external world</i><br>
<i>&gt;  changed, of course.</i><br>
<p>
I meant 'natural rerun', one which happens to _evolve_ into the same<br>
conscious being as you.  For this to happen without outside intervention, the<br>
conditions of the growth would have to be exact to a very high extent.  This<br>
idea is flawed however, because if the events before your death where exact<br>
then you would still die (without the intervention of an intelligent being).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Simulation as a posthumans recollection of the past, or as an experiment</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; could also rerun dead minds.  After simulating the consciousness of our</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; chosen victim, we could then put them into a steady state of evolution</i><br>
to<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; become fellow posthumans.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Sure, this is the basic thesis of Tipler's "Physics of Immortality".  Also</i><br>
<i>&gt;  similar to Hans Moravec's essay in an old issue of Extropy magazine.  Ever</i><br>
<i>&gt;  hear of that mag?</i><br>
<p>
Ex-what-tropy?  There's a magazine??  Next thing you'll be telling me that<br>
there's a website and FAQ!<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Preserving yourself at the time of death gives you a smaller time frame</i><br>
in<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; which to be reincarnated and would hopefully mean you'd have someone</i><br>
around<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; to tell you what happened.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The real reason is because the universe may not actually be infinite in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  either time or space, or conditions distant from our own may be</i><br>
sufficiently<br>
<i>&gt;  different that we cannot expect to experience infinite (or even many)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  incarnations.</i><br>
<p>
I was just offering a different reason, to say "even though it may be<br>
possible to be ressurected without being preserved, there are still reasons<br>
for it.."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; In short, even if we are all immortal, it's better to be in control of</i><br>
your<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; own resurrection (especially if time turns out to be finite, in which</i><br>
case<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; we're all screwed).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  If the infinities do exist, you can only control some fraction of your</i><br>
<i>&gt;  incarnations.  I don't see any way to stop someone from reincarnating all</i><br>
<i>&gt;  possible past humans and putting them into Hell.</i><br>
<p>
If you don't die you shouldn't have anything to fear (I doubt that cloned<br>
consciousness would have much effect on you if you are still alive).  If you<br>
do die you could be resurrected for all kinds of reasons.  The moral of this<br>
stroy is: never piss off a transhuman!<br>
<p>
How much does time effect your incarnations? For instance, could your<br>
consciousness end in the present and continue in the past?  or has that been<br>
in Extropy magazine already??<br>
