<i>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, such companies would almsot certainly be torn apart by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; IRS regulations concerning who is and is not considered an employee</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for tax purposes. Operating as an independant contractor is highly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; discouraged by the tax laws. Do too much work for one entity, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; suddenly both you and they will be in trouble with the IRS.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; As someone who makes his living doing consulting work, I'm acutely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; aware of the issues involved...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I suspect that as business and education environments evolve, laws and</i><br>
<i>&gt; regulations which effect business and education will also evolve (though</i><br>
<i>&gt; not at the same speed) to meet the needs of the community. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's been my experience. I wouldn't worry about it too much.</i><br>
<p>
I hate to be mean, but...<br>
<p>
That is a remarkably naive statement even for the "new" extropians<br>
list, and given postings here about about beef getting caught in your<br>
stomach and planets flipping over because of all the other planets<br>
being in some special position, etc., thats saying quite a bit.<br>
<p>
Bureaucrats do not shift their positions to accomodate the needs of<br>
the community. They change things to accomodate THEIR needs, which are<br>
usually diametrically opposed to those of the surrounding<br>
community. Business is becoming more regulated every day, not less,<br>
and I've seen no evidence of business regulation generally evolving to<br>
meet anyone's needs except for the need of government bureaucracies to<br>
grow and increase their own funding.<br>
<p>
Your comment betrays a remarkable lack of connection to the real world.<br>
<p>
I realize I should probably phrase that more diplomatically, be kindly<br>
and considerate, etc., but I'm just not in the mood.<br>
<p>
[Boy, I long for the old days on this list. Right now, it appears that<br>
the tolerance for uncritical thinking is at an all time high. What<br>
happened to the extropians list where anti-statist, hard science<br>
backed discussion was the norm?]<br>

Dear Perry and other fellow Extropians.<br>
<p>
With all due respect I must regrettably inform you that your perception of<br>
the interaction between legislation and social change is incorrect.<br>
<p>
At least that has been my experience during the last fourty years in<br>
governmental administration, legislative drafting and analysis.<br>
<p>
Enjoy!!!<br>
