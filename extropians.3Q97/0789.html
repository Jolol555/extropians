Aha... this may explain our difference of opinion. You're talking purely<br>
about the amount of time required for maintenance when it's neccesary,<br>
whereas I'm talking about the frequency of maintenance and the frequency<br>
of failures. <br>
<p>
Sure, major maintenance on a more complex plane is going to be more<br>
complex and time-consuming, but from what I remember Bach's books he'd get<br>
up in the morning for an hour or two of maintenance on his biplane and<br>
even then every few weeks the engine would fail for some reason and he'd<br>
have to make an emergency landing. In comparison, he'd jump into his jet<br>
(T-38?) to fly between Florida and California with only a cursory<br>
preflight check; and it never crashed. In both cases they had major<br>
maintenance every once in a while, which would be much more work for the<br>
jet than the biplane. <br>
<p>
So complexity may increase the effort required to maintain an aircraft,<br>
but has little bearing on reliability. And since much of that maintenance<br>
involves taking things off, looking at them, and putting them back on,<br>
built-in nanosensors could eliminate most of that. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; You can sheild a large part of it, but you are going to preserve the</i><br>
<i>&gt; areas of greatest sheilding for your crew, and with a mid course</i><br>
<i>&gt; turnaround, you've gotta have two sheilds, unless you can unhitch from</i><br>
<i>&gt; it and turn around and rehitch to the sheild at midcourse.</i><br>
<p>
You missed the point; the shield is just supposed to be a big hunk of junk<br>
which flies along in front of your ship and erodes when hit. But you're<br>
right; you would have problems holding it in place while braking.  I guess<br>
you'd just rely on the exhaust from your engines vaporising anything small<br>
before it hit you; if you hit anything big you're dead anyway, shield or<br>
no shield. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Once they brought it back due to a broken toilet.</i><br>
<p>
Can you cite a mission number, because I don't remember that. I have vague<br>
memories of coming back early because of a blocked water dump valve, but<br>
that was a problem because the fuel cells need to dump water overboard,<br>
not because it affected the toilet. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The point is that things break more often than not with the shuttle,</i><br>
<i>&gt; even though it was custom built and is basically rebuilt after every</i><br>
<i>&gt; mission, and it only flies one week missions. </i><br>
<p>
Sure, but that's due to government designs, not an inherent problem with<br>
spacecraft (BTW, wasn't the last shuttle flight over two weeks?). And it<br>
still doesn't affect the fact that the majority of maintenance is fixed<br>
regardless of flight time. If a fuel cell breaks or a valve blocks up you<br>
just tear it out and fit a new one; that may require a few hours of<br>
overtime, but it's nothing compared to overhauling the engines. <br>
