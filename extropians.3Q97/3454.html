<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Why shouldn't we include the 20% who "scored it big"?  Such designations<br>
are arbitrary and, quite frankly, insulting to the people who busted their<br>
ass to achieve financial success.  I am quite sure that most of the people<br>
in the top 20% are not the under-motivated couch potatoes that make up a<br>
non-trivial percentage of the people in the lower 80%.<br>
<p>
I might also add that (according to Money magazine and other sources),<br>
something like *half* of all millionaires in the US are essentially blue<br>
collar workers who worked really hard to achieve their goals of financial<br>
success.  And this despite the supposed lack of opportunity to achieve such<br>
goals as an "ordinary person".  I have an uncle who is an absurdly rich<br>
mega-millionaire that started as a construction worker with a high school<br>
diploma and perpetually drive to succeed.  <br>
<p>
The only difference I see between my uncle and most everyone else is the<br>
perpetual drive to succeed.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Eric: Okay, but when they leave benefited jobs to go to temp work, are </i><br>
<i>&gt;they getting enough of a pay increase to more than compensate for the </i><br>
<i>&gt;loss of benefits and "job security"?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Me:  Absolutely not.  That's why most families need 2 breadwinners </i><br>
<i>&gt;now..</i><br>
<p>
Many families have 2 breadwinners because they enjoy the benefits, not<br>
because it is necessary.  The vast majority of Americans can comfortably<br>
live a lifestyle far below the one they actually pay for.  As for the temp<br>
workers, I am a temp worker that makes enough to support a few families<br>
although I don't have one.  My success hasn't kept other people from<br>
achieving theirs,though.  Rather quite the opposite.  I am putting both my<br>
brother AND my sister through medical school despite no obligation to do so.  <br>
<p>
I also think people should be more concerned with *employment* security<br>
than job security.  Employment security doesn't depend on the company you<br>
work for, but rather it depends on YOU.  I don't have job security.  But I<br>
spend a lot of time making sure that I have excellent employment security.<br>
People don't like employment security as much as job security because it<br>
puts the responsibility on them.  People who don't take this responsibility<br>
are the architects of their own demise.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Eric: Who conducted the poll?  What was the methodology of the poll?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Certainly I have less job security than ever before... I planned it </i><br>
<i>&gt;that way.  Job security isn't something I find</i><br>
<i>&gt;desirable.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Me: USA Today.  Job insecurity might be okay for you when you have an </i><br>
<i>&gt;IQ over 140 and computer skills to equip an army.  But what about the </i><br>
<i>&gt;rest of the country who have kids to raise, let alone having even touched </i><br>
<i>&gt;a computer?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I hate to sound cliche, but where there is a will there is a way.<br>
<p>
I am one of the computer professionals you mention above.  However, I am<br>
completely self-taught (my formal education has never appeared on my<br>
resume) and I essentially lived in poverty most of my life until relatively<br>
recently.  That I am successful now has more to do with me working<br>
perpetual 80 hour weeks and the motivation to improve myself more than any<br>
other factor.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Eric: Um, what is wrong with working 50 and 60 hour workweeks if that </i><br>
<i>&gt;is what you want to do?  My own work pattern has been lately developing </i><br>
<i>&gt;into working for several months, and then not working at all for</i><br>
<i>&gt;six weeks or so.  Ideally I'd like to have a pattern of six months on, </i><br>
<i>&gt;six months off. None of the figures you present indicate that this </i><br>
<i>&gt;couldn't be happening with most of the people you are worrying about.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Me: Nothing is wrong with working 60 hours/wk if thats what *you want </i><br>
<i>&gt;to do*.  Most people hate their jobs - they do it because they have to </i><br>
<i>&gt;survive.  Again, I'm glad you have the luxury, high IQ and skills to </i><br>
<i>&gt;design your own flex-schedule - most do not have that option.  Where have </i><br>
<i>&gt;you been?  Obviously you've spent way to long in your cybernetic ivory </i><br>
<i>&gt;tower to notice (I hear Marie Antoinette again).</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Again, people are largely responsible for their own demise, one way or<br>
another.  I, too, hate my job despite the fact that I get payed more than<br>
what most average people dare to hope for.  However, I *designed* my life<br>
to include the long, well-paid hours with the option of long vacations.  It<br>
is not accidental.  It requires conscious effort.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Eric: Job security is not an objectively good thing.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Me: Don't tell that to the average working family or they'll likely </i><br>
<i>&gt;draw and quarter you.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That they would have such a negative reaction indicates that there is a<br>
measure of truth in such a statement.<br>
Not wanting to believe something doesn't mean it isn't so.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Eric: Also, your "increasingly unnecessary" claim is totally </i><br>
<i>&gt;unsubstantiated.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Me:  Tell that to the people who have been automated out of a job.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;All I'm asking is for you to tell me what people of average IQ, little </i><br>
<i>&gt;money and little skill are going to do when the majority of the economy has </i><br>
<i>&gt;been automated?  Most of these people are not collected money from </i><br>
<i>&gt;mutual funds even if they knew how.  Are you saying invest money or die?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The problem has less to do with skill and IQ than in the lack of desire to<br>
succeed.<br>
Yes, I know, everyone *claims* they want to be successful.  But success<br>
requires work as well as will, and this is where most people fall short.  <br>
<p>
The people who are left behind are those who either refuse to adapt (the<br>
majority), or those that cannot adapt (the minority).  Such a distribution<br>
will occur in any society, due mostly to natural selection more than<br>
anything.  As much as I have a distaste for unnecessary human suffering, I<br>
also realize that this is in many ways a necessary (perhaps unavoidable)<br>
part of the process.<br>
<p>
[...snip...]<br>
<i>&gt; After all, we can't have 80%+ of the population lying </i><br>
<i>&gt;around watching TV, having sex and smoking pot, can we?  </i><br>
<p>
80%?  Correlation? Causation perhaps?  Hmmmm...<br>
<p>
I wonder if this is the same 80% that complains they don't succeed...;^)<br>
<p>
But seriously, what most people don't realize is that if they applied<br>
themselves more *efficiently* (you know, work smarter, not harder) they<br>
would not only make more money, but have more time to watch TV, have sex,<br>
and smoke pot.  <br>
