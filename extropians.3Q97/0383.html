How can you even ask the second question if you don't know that the first <br>
is true?<br>
<p>

<p>
Which planet's intelligent life?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; First, the Air Force's 'mogul' explanation's biggest problem for me is the </i><br>

<p>
And who, exactly, claimed it was scattered over quarter of a mile? I don't<br>
have access to original documents, but I do have a cite for the<br>
_Alberquerque Journal_, July 9 1947 claiming that the recovered object was<br>
about three feet across... Hmm, odd, that's around about the size of the<br>
Mogul balloon's payload, isn't it? Bet it's just one of them coincidences. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Second, the Air Force has yet to explain the extreme security measures it </i><br>
<i>&gt; took to recover and dispose of this 'balloon'.  Even if it was a top secret </i><br>
<i>&gt; spy device a simple gathering of the wreckage of a 'weather balloon' and an </i><br>
<i>&gt; embarrassing apology for releasing a false report ('We have recovered a </i><br>
<i>&gt; flying saucer') would have sufficed. </i><br>
<p>
It's a black program, or the 40s equivalent; indeed, as far as I'm aware<br>
it was part of the nuclear development programs (checking for radioactive<br>
fallout from Russian bombs), and hence security would have been incredibly<br>
tight. What do you expect them to do? <br>
<p>
BTW, you do realise that New Mexico was in the middle of a spate of<br>
'flying disc' reports, don't you? Someone's collected together nine<br>
newspaper reports of 'flying discs' from July 1st to July 11th, several of<br>
which were either parts of weather balloons or hoaxes. Don't you think<br>
that in the circumstances it's not entirely surprising that that's how it<br>
was first reported? I mean, after all, that's pretty much what the<br>
balloon's payload looked like. <br>
<p>
Finally, how come no reference to aliens at Roswell was ever made<br>
publically until more than thirty years later? <br>
