Indeed, how much of who YOU are was "invented", or created by you?  Most<br>
of what we are is the work of (or actual copies of parts of) those who<br>
have gone before, yes?  Think of your genes, your language, mathematics,<br>
science, literature, your culture, history (memories of events you never<br>
experienced). <br>
<p>
This is my personal view of "heaven": being remembered in the sense of <br>
being incorporated in others, or at least archived and appreciated from <br>
time to time.  "Hell" then would be being archived as someone you want to <br>
avoid being like: pick any dictator you care to mention.<br>
