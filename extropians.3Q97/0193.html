<i>&gt;yeah, I just had a minor discussion with him, and here is his reply</i><br>
<i>&gt;denouncing extropy...</i><br>
<p>

<p>
I dunno.  He is wrong, and he's quite fanatic about what he's saying...<br>
But he's certainly not insane by any definition I'd like to find in common<br>
usage.  And was he that rude?  I've seen many an extropian say FAR worse<br>
about liberals.<br>
<p>
Granted, I wouldn't want to argue with him, as he's certainly not open to<br>
new ideas, but I also don't feel the ad hominem is appropriate.<br>
