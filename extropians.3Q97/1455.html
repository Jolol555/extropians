I would guess it is to avoid EM-noise; modern processors work at such<br>
frequencies that they get into the radio spectrum easily. As was<br>
pointed out, this can be a serious problem for some devices. I'm not<br>
that worried about pacemakers, modern pacemakers have a system that<br>
turns them the the "default" 70 bpm if their sensors appear to go<br>
nut, but there are many other systems that can get disrupted this<br>
way. An extropian might even consider spreading EM-noise an<br>
infringement on privacy.<br>
<p>
Are you sure the FCC are outlawing *all* home building, or just<br>
outlawing home building which doesn't meet the standards? There is a<br>
big difference between the two, although following the standards can<br>
of course be very tricky.<br>
