The "web part" would probably make the information much more<br>
expensive to get at.  Believe it or not, not everybody has<br>
Ricochet yet...<br>

I haven't used a Newton, but they are supposed to be able to<br>
"squirt" business card information in IR.  It's a terrible<br>
shame they didn't include an IR bulb in the PalmPilot for<br>
transferring (say) address book records, especially since i<br>
hear that the Dragonball even has specialized pins for IR<br>
output.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br>
<p>
Then again, it sounds like what we're after is a radio<br>
transmitter: one that you don't need to intentionally<br>
activate broadcasting for.  But your batteries wouldn't last.<br>
