<i>&gt; &gt; The Extropian is IMO dedicated to the advancement of humanity, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is to the idea of improvement. Pseudo-science is a serious diversion,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in several ways. It's perfectly acceptable to invoke new physics,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; but you must do so explicitly. Otherwise, you are simply exploring</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; an alternate universe that has no relationship to the improvement</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of humanity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My first experience with transhuman technology came out of reading</i><br>
<i>&gt; science fiction. Naturally, when I finally encountered people who were</i><br>
<i>&gt; actively pursuing these technologies, I had no choice but to be excited.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sometimes, when reading the posts of Carl Feynman, Anders Sandberg, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the other highly credible scientific minds on this list, I still feel</i><br>
<i>&gt; like I'm reading SF -- future-things desirable and unfathomable at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I've been reading science fiction for most of my life. I read more SF<br>
than<br>
all other categories combined, and I read a lot. the family budget for<br>
books<br>
exceeds $200/month. Good science fiction is characterized by careful<br>
treatment of science: the author knows that you cannot go FTL unless<br>
you invoke a new law of physics. An SF book in which the earth's poles<br>
moved abruptly would be dismissed by the entire SF community, with<br>
scathing reviews, unless it included a reasonable description of a<br>
mechanism to account for the angular momentum and the absence of<br>
catastropic vulcanism.<br>
<p>
One great thing about science fiction is that it's a very enjoyable<br>
way to learn a lot of science. I'm no more willing to read SF<br>
with bogus science in it than I am to read posts on this list with<br>
bogus science in them. I am, however, more than willing to discuss<br>
the relevant real science, including questions from participants whose<br>
scientific education is incomplete, when an Extropian topic<br>
warrants it (which is often.) I'm weak in chemistry, and I've been<br>
asking for help on this list about the use of a STM to hook<br>
adamantine building bloks together.<br>
<p>
This will be my last post on this META topic, which is now beginning<br>
to clutter the list. I'll shift to private e-mail if needed.<br>
