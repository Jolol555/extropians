<i>&gt; I don't really know enough about the whole Mars face thing to comment on</i><br>
<i>&gt; Anton's questions (other than that it looks a lot like Elvis). But I</i><br>
<i>&gt; would like to ask whether list members think it merits closer</i><br>
<i>&gt; inspection, and if not, why?</i><br>
<p>
No, it merits no study at all.  On the Feynman-Hubbard scale I showed<br>
earlier, Hoagland rates about a 0.3, even below Velikofsky.  He doesn't<br>
even pretend to have any scientific objectivity or make any attempt<br>
at worthwhile scholarship.  I'm almost embarrassed by the amount I<br>
have read about him after convincing myself that he was a crackpot--I<br>
should not have wasted any more brain cells on him at that point, but<br>
there is something oddly fascinating about watching a fine bullshit<br>
artist at work, and he does turn a nice phrase.<br>
<p>
Now that I think about it, the scale would make an interesting essay.<br>
I can imagine some standards for some points of the scale, but I'd<br>
like to hear nominations for some others:<br>
<p>
  10.0 Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr: The standards.<br>
   9.0 Albert Einstein, Steven Hawking: No experiments, no 10.<br>
   8.0 ?<br>
   7.0 Carl Sagan: Some political influences, but does his homework<br>
       and maintains his integrity.<br>
   6.0 ?<br>
   5.0 Andrew Weil: One can be /too/ open-minded.  A bit too<br>
       theatrical and rhetorical, too.<br>
   4.0 Hal Puthoff, Fleischman &amp; Pons: Might be on to something,<br>
       but tend to announce results before verifying them.<br>
   3.0 ?<br>
   2.0 John Gray (Mars/Venus): Interesting ideas, thin on facts.<br>
   1.0 ?<br>
   0.0 L. Ron Hubbard, Creationists, Astrologers.<br>
