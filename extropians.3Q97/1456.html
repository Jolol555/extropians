<p>
Small insects have around a thousand neurons. Assuming 10^3 Hz update<br>
frequency and 10^3 synapses each, we need on the order of 10^10 flops<br>
for uploading a real time insect. Not that far from what we can do<br>
today, although it would be impractical. This is a high upper bound<br>
on the complexity of an insect animat; most functions can be done<br>
much more easily as can be seen in robotics labs over the world. So<br>
my guess is that a few megaflops of computing power might be enough.<br>
The size of the computer will depend on the available technology;<br>
today it would be hard to make a clever enough insect-animat, but in<br>
a few years it should be quite doable.<br>

<p>
Smarts isn't really needed, cunning is better. Insects are stupid,<br>
but they can do great evasive flying and very complex manipulation<br>
based on simple, interconnected responses. A cell repair device could<br>
just move around randomly, avoiding things that could be damaged <br>
by it until it found something that was damaged, then it would fix<br>
it. No more brain than a simple insect; I guess you could get that<br>
power into a 100nm side cube. <br>
