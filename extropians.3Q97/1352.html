Dear Sherwood,<br>
<p>
I will, one day, reach the end of your mail.<br>
But then I'll take another advantadge of it, requiring a <br>
pos-graduation in Political Sciences too...(hehe)<br>
<p>
Just joking. They are really unquestionably interesting citatons...<br>
<p>
I'm also involved, here in Brazil, with some political regional <br>
agreements that deal with nuclear subjects in Latin America. <br>
I understand the position of the governments... <br>
(gomes@cnen.GOV.br). Nevertheless we also know that if certain <br>
things are not said, the tendency of some minds (and politics..) is <br>
the classic "accomodated and comfortable" positionment  (contrary to <br>
evolutive one...), sometimes in  accordance to majority, which <br>
do not always necessarily know  what is really better for <br>
them or other people... Principally about subjects related to <br>
Science and Technology... For example, they are still "running like <br>
pigs from a gun" [Lennon-McCartney] about clones... And the <br>
particular positionments of the governments are being observed (and <br>
locally judged) by those who really understand of such <br>
subjects...  (Is the government being inteligently satisfactory ? <br>
The same government that can prohibit genetical experiences <br>
with humans could, as nobody else, conduct them with security and <br>
a *really* global and political discernment ... and admirable <br>
authority...) But it is never unsuable to remember that <br>
(democratic) governments are always our friends, avoiding so <br>
desperate acts like Fermi's or Oppenheimer's, f. ex. They <br>
didn't have a globally correct political behaviour... and did <br>
wrong... Although were great scientists... <br>
