Although I have been in the periphery of the adversarial panoply of Cassini,<br>
I'd like to address some data and if anyone has a difference of opinion,<br>
please do let me know. If this information has already passed through the<br>
list and either as a solo post or thread of comments, would someone kindly<br>
advise me and I'll go to the archives and look it up.<br>
<p>
To my knowledge, the plutonium that Cassini is scheduled to carry onboard is<br>
in the range of 60 - 70 pounds.  The size is applicable to lipstick tubes<br>
and in hardened metal container encasing the chemical.  <br>
<p>
Adversaries are alarmed about possible explosion during the launch and<br>
during earth flyby (gravity assist swing.)  <br>
<p>
Advocates of the mission have mitigated the situation by using armored<br>
containers so that if there is a first stage failure, the integrity of the<br>
containers are such that there could be no toxic problems.  They also state<br>
that it is literally impossible that there would be a flyby miscalculation,<br>
and even if there was, it would be known well before a possible collision<br>
and the course would be corrected.<br>
<p>
Plutonium has been onboard missions for decades: Voyager, Viking, Gemini all<br>
had plutonium onboard.  I'm not sure whether the antagonists are waving<br>
flags for some personal cause, or there is serious drawbacks to this<br>
particular missions' load. I have consulted with a few astronomer and space<br>
architect friends who are actively in the field of space travel. I haven't<br>
heard any alarm.  I'd appreciate hearing your thoughts.<br>
