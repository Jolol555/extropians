<i>&gt; : ...  Essentially, you have to get rid of money and replace it with</i><br>
<i>&gt; : a barter system.  We *can* do this now because we have enough computing</i><br>
<i>&gt; : power to institute "complex barter" systems.  [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; : Complex barter is too hard to keep track of - without computers,</i><br>
<i>&gt; : heh heh heh - which is why we have money, to transform every transaction</i><br>
<i>&gt; : into a simple barter.  By "money", we here mean something with artificial</i><br>
<i>&gt; : value, rather than universal units of exchange.  A complex barter system</i><br>
<i>&gt; : can still have standardized units of valuation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So you'd abolish money *and* keep it.  Wonderful.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or did you just mean abolish fiat money?  No argument here.</i><br>
<p>
No, I'd *obsolete* money.  By money, I mean not merely gov't fiat money, but<br>
any unit of exchange which is declared, by public or private authority, to<br>
have non-intrinsic value, or value pegged to a product which fluctuates in<br>
demand.  A unit of exchange has substance; a unit of valuation is simply a<br>
measuring tool.  Compare a meter-stick and a meter.  Do you really want to<br>
measure a building in "meter-sticks", or speed in "kilometer-sticks/hour"? <br>
And every time you want to find out how tall something is, you can *only* use<br>
meter-sticks; and if you want to tell someone else how tall something is, you<br>
have to give him a bundle of meter-sticks.  Don't forget that the meter-sticks<br>
shrink and expand at random!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : What would be accomplished by this?  Well, one of the economic design</i><br>
<i>&gt; : flaws leading to our current problem is - more than I can finish this</i><br>
<i>&gt; : sentence with.  Here's what happens.  Person A, who builds widgets,</i><br>
<i>&gt; : builds 100 widgets.  B through K also build 100 widgets.  Unfortunately,</i><br>
<i>&gt; : there is only a market for 1,000 widgets total.  But 1,100 have been built.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; : The standard capitalistic reply at this point is that G, who isn't very</i><br>
<i>&gt; : good at this, goes out of business.  There are only two problems:  First,</i><br>
<i>&gt; : G can't get another job,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then G is in deep doodoo anyway when widgets are made obsolete!</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why did G get into this business?</i><br>
<p>
A money-based economy, or simple-barter economy, under the pressure of<br>
technological stress, will malfunction in such a way that the supply of labor<br>
outpaces demand to a greater extent than it should.  Hence, G can't get<br>
another job because there *are* no jobs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : and more importantly, that's NOT what actually happens!  Instead, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; : price of widgets drops.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the short term.  In the long term, G goes out of business.</i><br>
<i>&gt; No contradiction.</i><br>
<p>
No, *everyone* goes out of business.  It's not just G's widgets that are dropping!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : Like a brick.  They trade widgets for cigar bands on a one-to-one basis.</i><br>
<i>&gt; : The result is that not even E, who's the best, can make a living - much</i><br>
<i>&gt; : less G.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You can't predict how much the price drops, because any drop may make</i><br>
<i>&gt; some other use for widgets economical, at which point it drops no further.</i><br>
<p>
This is the conventional, neat, mathematical, rational-agents economics<br>
theory.  It fails utterly when met by experiment.  Have you heard of the<br>
dollar that was auctioned off for $3.12?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Can the total price for all widgets fall?  I don't think so:</i><br>
<i>&gt; if the old price was $N, we know that any number of widgets over 1000</i><br>
<i>&gt; is worth at least $1000N to the buyers; if the supply of widgets goes</i><br>
<i>&gt; to 1100, they're *still* worth $1000N, so it seems to me that the price</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't fall below $10N/11.</i><br>
<p>
Wrong.  Without the stabilizing force of private futures contracts, there<br>
exists a "catastrophe effect", or "punctuated equilibrium", or<br>
"discontinuity", or "attractor boundary" (in case you're familiar with any of<br>
these terms).  If demand outpaces supply, then widgets are worth what buyers<br>
are willing to pay: $100.  If supply outpaces demand, then widgets are worth<br>
what sellers are willing to accept: $10.  Since neither sellers nor buyers are<br>
altruistic, and a $10 loss on selling at $10 is better than a $20 loss on not<br>
selling at all, the price of widgets can drop below the levels necessary for survival.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : In an ideal world, this overproduction would simply raise standards of</i><br>
<i>&gt; : living.  Really.  Think about it.  There are more widgets for everyone!</i><br>
<i>&gt; : Hooray!  Again, ideally, food would be overproduced.  So the price of</i><br>
<i>&gt; : food would drop as well.  The price of everything would drop, and widgets</i><br>
<i>&gt; : would be dirt cheap, but so would be everything else, and A and E and G</i><br>
<i>&gt; : and K would all be rich.</i><br>
<i>&gt; :</i><br>
<i>&gt; : The problem is that production of food is out of sync with production of</i><br>
<i>&gt; : widgets.  The current economy was BUILT ON SCARCITY.  Everyone, everything,</i><br>
<i>&gt; : is centered on the idea that supply is always slightly less than demand.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yeah, if "demand" means the number you get if you ask everyone "How</i><br>
<i>&gt; many widgets could you use if they were free?" and add them all up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; To an economist, demand is a (decreasing) function of price.</i><br>
<p>
I suppose that's why they call it the dismal science.  Demand is a smoothly<br>
decreasing function of price, but price is not a smooth function of demand:supply.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : If one - and only one - field shifts to a massive-supply model, that field</i><br>
<i>&gt; : suffers.  It's like being the only cooperator in a world of defectors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; : You need a massive shift.</i><br>
<i>&gt; :</i><br>
<i>&gt; : And again, the existence of money is the problem.  Not private property!</i><br>
<i>&gt; : I'm not saying that.  The problem is money instead of barter.  See, in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; : barter system, you can establish valuations that can outlast supply and</i><br>
<i>&gt; : demand, or at least weather the turbulence created by switching to an</i><br>
<i>&gt; : Economy of Plenty.  Suppose that we declare one widget to equal one</i><br>
<i>&gt; : hamburger in value.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Price controls?!</i><br>
<p>
No, a futures contract, silly.  Sheesh, just because every other designed<br>
economy has been interventionist and communistic, mine has to be too?  I'm an Extropian!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : Now, even if there are too many widgets, anyone who's made a widget can</i><br>
<i>&gt; : still get a hamburger in exchange.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;From whom?  Blank-out, as Rand would say.  You wave your hands and say,</i><br>
<i>&gt; presto, a widget is worth a hamburger; for anyone who produces a widget,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there's someone who'll be glad to provide a hamburger.  Meanwhile all</i><br>
<i>&gt; the hamburger-makers are scratching their heads and asking each other,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do *you* want another widget??  Omnisciently-mediated complex barter</i><br>
<i>&gt; won't change that.</i><br>
<p>
Before the existence of grain futures, farmers would dump their harvest into<br>
the harbor.  There was too much supply, and demand was too focused in time. <br>
We deal with a similar but more subtle problem.  And for the record, the<br>
complex barter is not mediated by a central authority.<br>
<p>
If the hamburger-makers don't *want* any more widgets, if the market is<br>
saturated, then no additional output of widgets will improve living<br>
conditions.  In this situation, complex barter can (temporarily?) prevent a<br>
widget catastrophe.  Competition will take place along the lines of "who can<br>
make the better widget?"  G, however, will go out of business sooner or later.<br>
 Which is OK, because nothing would improve if he was in business.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : G's widgets might rot, but that's better than all the widgets rotting.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Irrelevant</i><br>
<p>
Not at all; I am stating a causal fork.  Ordinary economy-&gt;all widgets rot,<br>
complex barter economy-&gt;G's widgets rot.  Granted that we wish to minimize<br>
rotting widgets, this constitutes an argument in favor of complex barter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : We'll assume, actually, the existence of some buffer, some temporary</i><br>
<i>&gt; : charitable system, so that G remains in business for at least a month</i><br>
<i>&gt; : or two - while the production of hamburgers increases also.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But why does the production of hamburgers increase?</i><br>
<p>
The hamburger-makers want to buy more widgets, or lots of other stuff. <br>
Assured by their futures contracts that prices won't drop catastrophicly just<br>
because they're being more productive, they can become richer in proportion to<br>
their increased work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : We can also move up to establish a futures market - even better than</i><br>
<i>&gt; : barter - for absolutely everything on the planet.  Then even G's widgets</i><br>
<i>&gt; : don't rot.  Instead, everyone sells 91 widgets instead of 100 - which may</i><br>
<i>&gt; : sound bad, but that's on a G-just-went-into-business model.  If you assume</i><br>
<i>&gt; : a technological overproduction, 91 widgets is just what they sold last</i><br>
<i>&gt; : year.  It's technological overproduction that's the problem, after all -</i><br>
<i>&gt; : population expansion is self-correcting.  So everyone has an extra 9</i><br>
<i>&gt; : widgets to trade for whatever they want.  Hopefully, someone besides</i><br>
<i>&gt; : widget-makers is overproducing, so the surplus can all be traded around.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If I understand you -- you cartelize the widget-makers, give each a</i><br>
<i>&gt; quota of widgets to sell, to keep the price up; and then you tell them,</i><br>
<i>&gt; go ahead and swap your excess widgets for anything so long as it's not</i><br>
<i>&gt; money.</i><br>
<p>
WHAT?  NO!  Not at *all*!  No central authority is involved.  People can still<br>
write futures contracts for money; people dumb enough to do so will lose. <br>
Nobody wants money; we want TVs, food, vacations...  Why should I have to<br>
worry about some currency fluctuation wiping out my vacation?  If the<br>
vacation-maker wants hospitalization and Internet access, and hospitals and<br>
ISPs want widgets, we can set up a complex futures contract so I produce X<br>
widgets and get a vacation in exchange.  Everyone's happy.  What quota?  What<br>
cartel?  What central authority?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Result: a speculator obtains the excess widgets by barter,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and sells them for cash, undercutting the other widgets.</i><br>
<p>
The widget makers may be undercut, but they can still sell enough to survive. <br>
Futures contracts, remember?  This is how you remove the catastrophic cliff<br>
from the price&lt;-supply:demand curve.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : Eventually, everyone overproduces,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why?</i><br>
<p>
Overproducing is buffered (by private contracts) from ill effect, and will<br>
primarily result in your being rich.  The existence of infrastructure for<br>
certain types of stabilizing private contracts will shift the cost/benefit of<br>
higher production.  At present, this cost/benefit ratio is often negative<br>
where it shouldn't be.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; : and those who produce the most wind up with the most of the overproduction.</i><br>
<i>&gt; : So the system has two parts, really:  One, a futures market (applied to</i><br>
<i>&gt; : EVERYTHING) so that overproduction doesn't cause prices to drop, and two,</i><br>
<i>&gt; : a complex barter system - whose necessity is kind of hard to put into</i><br>
<i>&gt; : words, but...  The value of a dollar is arbitrary.  If a widget-future</i><br>
<i>&gt; : involves $5 a widget, the value of the contract is affected by fluctuations</i><br>
<i>&gt; : in the money supply as well as the supply of widgets.  A widget-future</i><br>
<i>&gt; : which involves trading one hundred hamburgers for one hundred widgets</i><br>
<i>&gt; : may fluctuate all over the place in THEORY, but in practice, one hundred</i><br>
<i>&gt; : hamburgers are what the widget-maker will eat this year.  In other words,</i><br>
<i>&gt; : the universal futures economy is very vulnerable to inflation, which a</i><br>
<i>&gt; : complex-barter system will stop.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Drop the neo-communism and stick to reforming money.</i><br>
<p>
What neo-communism?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You're onto something there.  What if money is *defined* as futures?</i><br>
<p>
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Have you read anything on competitive currency?</i><br>
<p>
Currency is a mistake.  It results in information loss.  On the<br>
capitalism-communism spectrum, currency is a communist affector relative to<br>
barter, which is the primeval state of mutually beneficial exchange that<br>
defines capitalism.<br>
