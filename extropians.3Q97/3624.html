 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; and, as far as I know,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; adding cryoprotectants (glycerol or dimethylsulfoxide mostly) is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; necessary to preserve microorganisms at very low temperatures. They act</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; by preventing the formation of water crystals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; There are indeed complex species (such as some frogs) that can survive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; freezing, they do so by producing a cryoprotectant and then spreading it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; through the body.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Our case is much different, first because we are obviously much more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; complex than any microorganism or even than a frog. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That's not a reason, silly!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It ends up being, indirectly, one. Errors occur and since we are more</i><br>
<i>&gt; complex the chances of errors occurring increases. How many times have</i><br>
<i>&gt; you heard of therapies that work fine 'in vitro' and in monkeys and</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't work in humans?</i><br>
<p>
This is not *necessarily* an issue of complexity, just difference.  We<br>
will know how different/similar we truly are only when/if we adapt the<br>
frogs method of freezing-tolerance to human beings.  I'd say the jury is<br>
still out. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Just our brain, is so much more advanced than a</i><br>
<i>&gt; frog's that the possibilities of errors are incomparable.</i><br>
<p>
I would replace "incomparable" with "significantly larger."  Otherwise,<br>
I'd agree with this statement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There might be</i><br>
<i>&gt; types of cells in our bodies that doesn't exist in frogs and that will</i><br>
<i>&gt; not freeze the same way as the other cells. </i><br>
<i>&gt; An increase in complexity always increases the potential of errors. BTW,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that is one of the reasons why aging occur in complex animals such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; mammals and doesn't occur in primitive species such as sharks.</i><br>
<p>
Let us examine a specific case of genetic error, cancer:<br>
<p>
Would you say that the reason sharks don't get cancer is because they<br>
have a simple genome?  Firstly, I'd have a hard time calling sharks<br>
primitive.  I would, however, call a number of plants primitive, all of<br>
which have been known to develop tumors.  As human beings, we have a more<br>
complicated and prone-to-error genome, but we also have more<br>
sophisticated ways of dealing with these errors-- apparently, so do<br>
sharks. <br>
<p>
I have another quibble in the form of a question:  can you think of an<br>
organism more primitive than a shark that DOES age?<br>
<p>
All this said, in principle, I agree with what you're trying to say.<br>
<p>
 IMHO,<br>
<i>&gt; their evolution lead them to correct the errors in their genome while</i><br>
<i>&gt; our evolution made us consecutively more complex</i><br>
<p>
Are you saying their evolution *did not* make them consecutively more<br>
complex?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and therefore more</i><br>
<i>&gt; susceptible of having genetic errors or lethal genes. For more see my</i><br>
<i>&gt; next message which is mainly about the evolution of aging.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What's the difference between altering you current brain and genome, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; transferring to a new one?  Is there something special about the neurons</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that nature gave us?  And if they're so special, why don't you leave</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; them the way they are? I'm not so attached to them. As long as I can do</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; all the same things with my new consciousness-vehicle(or more things), why</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; should I care whether I've got organic axons or metal ones?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Transferring? Transferring what? Your brain? Your 'soul'?</i><br>
<p>
The functioning and abilities of my brain.  I would call this<br>
"consciousness"  Some might argue with my use of this word.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; One idea (that I already though about years ago) is to increase the</i><br>
<i>&gt; viability of our neurons with metal or whatever but this is a continuos</i><br>
<i>&gt; process. Just like now, the atoms that compose my neurons are not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same that were a few hours ago, exception made to some molecules such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; DNA, our neuron's atoms change continually and I don't complain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Connecting memory chips to our brain might not be a bad idea but that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a change and not a transfer. </i><br>
<p>
If your brain ends up in the same state after a series of "changes" or one<br>
single transfer, what, exactly, is the difference?<br>
<p>
The only difference I can see is simply one of safety: if the changes<br>
start to suck away your conscious thought, you know your uploading process<br>
is not working, and you can stop before you have changed your entire brain<br>
into a less fragile form.  I will opt for this method if it is available.<br>
It is still uploading, however.  This idea you "thought about years ago"<br>
is called "nano-replacement"  Look it up.<br>
<p>
Obviously, before uploading can be achieved, we have to understand all the<br>
functioning of neurons that contribute to consciousness and then be able<br>
ot duplicate those functions on another platform.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I never understood that uploading approach. Consciousness-vehicle? What</i><br>
<i>&gt; is that? A machine with your thoughts? It would take a long time to</i><br>
<i>&gt; change our organic neurons to metal ones </i><br>
<p>
How long exactly?  Are you in a rush?  ;)<br>
<p>
Do you think it would take a long time, even with nanotechnology-<br>
assemblers and the like?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and even these would still be</i><br>
<i>&gt; neurons. </i><br>
<p>
Perfect.  I kinda like neurons.  Maybe I'll even keep some organic ones<br>
for sentimental value.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And, like I mention before, it would have to be a continuos</i><br>
<i>&gt; process and not an instant occurrence.</i><br>
<p>
Well, we can't really do anything *instanteously*.(but thats more physics<br>
than biology) But we can theoretically do it fast, and why not, as long as<br>
it's safe?<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Don't you think your brain is a bit too fragile?  Personally, I lose</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; neurons everyday, and they don't grow back.  Don't yours do the same?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Aren't you going to run out eventually?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, that's called aging. I intend, in the course of my life, to find a</i><br>
<i>&gt; solution to that problem. I could give a thousand good ideas but that</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be terribly boring for you.</i><br>
<p>
What about when I bang my head on the door, is that aging?  I would say <br>
no, yet my neurons die, never to grow back.<br>
<p>
Even in birds, where the neurons do grow back, the information contained<br>
within those neurons is lost forever. <br>
<p>
Hey, if you have "good ideas" to stop aging, I'll be very receptive to<br>
them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; As for evidence, well it's more of a philosophical, theoretical problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; rather than a biological one. See the few cases I placed in my last two</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; messages and you'll know what I mean. Personally, I believe (and notice</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the verb to believe instead of the usual verb to think) that I'm my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; brain and that is my conscience.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I cannot debate against someone who "believes."  Have you read Max More's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; paper on Pancritical Rationalism.  I see it as a fairly good alternative</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to "believing."  Can't you see that belief stagnates progress?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What if you're wrong?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No-one is perfect, we all make mistakes. With the evidences and proofs I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have, which are none, I believe my brain is my only conscience. When I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have some reliable information saying the contrary, I'll change my</i><br>
<i>&gt; opinion.</i><br>
<p>
If you have no evidence or proofs, what is the source of this "belief" of<br>
yours.  Also, what purpose does this belief serve?  Are you afraid of<br>
being "undecided"?<br>
<p>
What makes you think the brain is the only platform for consciouness?  It<br>
sounds like a very religious and anthropocentric assumption.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Nice talking to you,</i><br>
<p>
A pleasure.<br>
