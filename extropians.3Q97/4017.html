"United we stand, divided we fall".  Against what?  Cheaper prices and<br>
better goods?  <br>
<p>
Why do you think the small shops fail?  Because people desert them and<br>
go buy their stuff in the big shops, right?  But why do they do that? <br>
Are they all being hypnotised by somebody to go to big shops and desert<br>
the little shops?  <br>
<p>
I think you will find no hypnotist, but the simple fact that people<br>
desert the little shops and buy from the big shops because they want to.<br>
<p>
And why do they want to?  Many reasons: because it's cheaper, more<br>
convenient, more variety, perhaps you can get all your shopping done in<br>
one go.<br>
<p>
But in fact, little shops *can* survive, for they do serve a purpose,<br>
only we need less of the ones that merely try to duplicate what the big<br>
shops do well, and offer instead more of what makes small shops useful -<br>
being closer to where you live so you can just pop out and get something<br>
you've forgotten, offer a more personalised service, which can be nice,<br>
etc., etc.<br>
<p>
Is all this supposed to be a problem, then?<br>
<p>
All our interests are linked in society, Joao.  There is no "us" and<br>
"them".  We are all one, and what benefits me *can* benefit you, it<br>
doesn't *have* to be at your expense.  In the long run, and in terms of<br>
society as a whole, what benefits the corporations can benefit, and what<br>
benefits you can benefit the corporations.  (The trick is of course to<br>
have the right social habits so that our activities are channeled in<br>
co-operative ways, like the market, like other beneficial human social<br>
institutitons - our loves, friendships, groupings, enterprises, clubs,<br>
hobby groups, creative teams, etc., etc.)<br>
<p>
You may say what about the expense of those who lose their jobs in the<br>
small shops?  <br>
<p>
Yes, it isn't so good for them, and it can even be unpleasant. But while<br>
few people wouldn't sympathise, on the other hand nobody owes them a<br>
living, nobody was put on this earth to serve anybody else's interests,<br>
and it is morally evil to force people to serve other peoples' interests.<br>
<p>
All that has happened is that they did what they thought would be good<br>
for them (running a shop, or offering their services to someone who runs<br>
a shop), and they were wrong: as it turns out, nobody wants what they<br>
are offering.<br>
<p>
So, they will have to look around for something else to offer, somewhere<br>
where their energies will be accepted by their fellow human beings.<br>
<p>
The thing is, because the big shops are more efficient (more, or the<br>
same, for less), that frees up resources to create *new* things, new<br>
things for people to spend their extra freed-up money on, and so,<br>
eventually, and in the long run, people do find new employment offering<br>
those new things.<br>
<p>
This adversarial view of yours is, I think, quite a wrong way to look at<br>
things.  It isn't helping you understand what's going on.<br>
