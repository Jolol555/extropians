<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; to the "base"; how much energy this is is a bit hard to tell right now</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; (it is 1.30 in the morning here :-), but it looks like it will take</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; a while for the bomb-mold to blow up. A wild guess would be around a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; week.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Well, there's a couple of questions I'd pose about nuclear nanotech:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 1)  Can mini-assemblers build mini-thermonuclear devices?  If you have 10</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; grams instead of kilograms, but you still put the deuterium at the center and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; jacket with U-238, could you get the same effect?  What about custom-assembled</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; crystals that will collapse easily and tightly... maybe laced with water to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; slow neutrons down?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No. A fission bomb is based on the creation of a critical mass, where the</i><br>
<i>&gt; growth of neutron flux due to fission is larger than the loss into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; surroundings. Unless nanotech could build a neutron reflector (which I</i><br>
<i>&gt; doubt is physically possible?) it would still need several kilograms of</i><br>
<i>&gt; fissible material.</i><br>
<p>
Okay.  Well, it'd take more tech than I thought, but a few points:<br>
<p>
Modern atomic technology goes like this:  You have a mass of U235, with all<br>
the atoms inside being arranged randomly.  Atoms fission all the time, but the<br>
material isn't very dense, so most neutrons escape.  Then an implosive<br>
explosion occurs which condenses the material down to a tiny, tight ball. <br>
Neutrons collide with other U235 atoms, causing a chain reaction.<br>
<p>
We all know this implicitly, but I'm verbalizing it so we can alter the scenario.<br>
<p>
Now, my original suggestion was based on a passage from "Surely You're Joking,<br>
Mr. Feynman":<br>
<p>
	"It turned out that the army had realized how much stuff we needed to make a<br>
bomb - twenty kilograms or whatever it was - and they realized that this much<br>
material, purified, would never be in the plant, so there was no danger.  But<br>
they did not know that the neutrons were enormously more effective when they<br>
are slowed down in water.  In water it takes less than a tenth - no, a<br>
hundredth - as much material to make a reaction that makes radioactivity.  It<br>
kills people around and so on.  It was very dangerous, and they had not paid<br>
any attention to the safety at all."<br>
<p>
So you don't need neutron reflectors; just ordinary water.  I'm not sure<br>
whether "10% to make radioactivity" and "10% to get critical mass" are the same<br>
thing.  Could be a power relation I didn't factor in.  I'd be surprised to<br>
find out that they were unrelated, though.  Still, it could be that no amount<br>
of water decreases the size of a critical mass.  Let me know if so.<br>
<p>
My guess is that current bombs don't use water amplifiers, because the bombs<br>
would go around radiating lethal radiation all the time, and the material<br>
inside would melt.<br>
<p>
So.  The bomb is made of multiple concentric shells, with a small space left<br>
between each shell.  A millisecond before the bomb goes off, water is pumped<br>
into the space between shells.  Then the bomb crushes, and the water decreases<br>
the amount necessary for critical mass.  Or, if that won't work, you can have<br>
oxygen and hydrogen in close proximity.  The bomb crushes, and then nanotech<br>
very quickly turns the oxygen and hydrogen into water.  Or with nano-precision<br>
shaped charges and precisely positioned oxyhydro, you might be able to set up<br>
the reaction to occur naturally as a result of the explosion.<br>
<p>
And, getting a bit speculative, what if you take U235, store it in ordinary<br>
water, and then use nano to "catch" the slowed neutrons that emerge?  Could<br>
you store the neutrons and use them as a catalyst for the bomb?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; 2)  What about direct fusion devices?  Inertial confinement would be my guess.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Take the deuterium and imprison it inside a fullerene-bracketed block of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; diamond, then apply a large energy pulse, perhaps from an enormously efficient</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; quantum-well laser.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Doesn't sound very likely, although I'm more iffy on the physics here. First,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the entire structure would have to be macroscopic in order to do any damage,</i><br>
<i>&gt; so there is no real need to use fancy fullerenes to keep the hydrogen in.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And you would need to store enough energy for the laser, and somehow compress</i><br>
<i>&gt; almost all of the hydrogen, not just a small pellet (ah, thats the problem!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; which seems to be nearly impossible to do using laser light.</i><br>
<p>
The fullerenes would be macroscopic too.  (Arbitrary size, at least in<br>
theory.)  The fullerenes are there to help hold everything in place - for<br>
confinement.  Now that I think about, they'd hurt more than help, so forget 'em.<br>
<p>
Inertial confinement only operates on a single pellet, the fuse.  (Ha ha!) <br>
The problem with inertial confinement is delivering enough energy. <br>
Quantum-well lasers are something like 10 to 100 times as efficient, and I<br>
believe they aren't difficult to construct given nano.  Englobe the whole<br>
pellet with lasers instead of using one.  Then fire.  I think that you could<br>
probably deliver at least 1,000 times as much energy as in modern inertial<br>
confinement.  It'd take a gigajoule to set the thing off, sure, but then you<br>
have a fusion explosion and you can use it to set off arbitrarily larger ones.<br>
<p>
Or maybe you could set each and every photon to hit a designated atom at the<br>
designated time.  I'm not sure that would be too hard in theory, given atomic<br>
positioning and some quantum electrodynamics.  But (IMHO) it would take a HELL<br>
of a lot of computing power.  FAR more than the mere exaflops the human brain<br>
is estimated to use.  You'd probably need an entire quantum computer for each<br>
atom, a quantum continent for the whole pellet.  So chalk this up as a<br>
possible strategic advantage for black goo; if you can get a whole continent<br>
as base, you might be able to get arbitrary amounts of energy from fusion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; 3)  Given either of the two above, could you build a REALLY HUGE thermonuclear</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bomb, perhaps by surrounding the item with a huge U-238 crystal?  Direct the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; blast in a specific direction using the properties of crystals, maybe with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bit of quantum mechanics mixed in?  Use the blast to pump a graser?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, you could always pile up as much U and deuterium as you wanted around</i><br>
<i>&gt; it. The extra U would not really do much except make it dirtier (it will</i><br>
<i>&gt; mainly be blown away by the explosion instead of fissioned), but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; deuterium would add to the blast (that is why you can make fusion bombs</i><br>
<i>&gt; as large as you want).</i><br>
<p>
Huh.  As I recall, the U238 fizzed when the deuterium fused, which is how<br>
themonuclears got up to 50 megatons.  Well, either way, we're pretty much<br>
agreed that given a small sun to start with, you can make arbitrarily larger ones.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Directed nuclear explosions doesn't sound likely, since at present we</i><br>
<i>&gt; are relying on random nuclear fission with no preferred direction. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; we could make neutron mirrors things might get different.</i><br>
<p>
It seems to me that this all depends on what kind of quantum properties we can<br>
play with.  Light is very easy to play with.  Quantum electrodynamics lets us<br>
make it sit up, roll over, and play dead.  We can send it pretty much anywhere<br>
we want if we can make all the little arrows line up properly.  Now, are there<br>
quantum reasons why we can't do this with neutrons or protons?  Or is it just<br>
that we'd need to arrange atoms precisely?  If the former, nanonukes won't be<br>
much improved.  If the latter, nanonukes will be continent-wreckers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; In other words, nanotechnology operates as close to the level of nuclear</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reactions as we operate to the level of chemical explosives.  I can't help but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; think that there will be similar improvements in technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That is likely, if there is an interest. But remember that nanotech isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; much closer to the nuclear level than we are - it still cannot interface</i><br>
<i>&gt; directly with it, just move the atoms around. There are fundamental</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical problems here we need to look into to get the nano-nukes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Doing the same work as a nuke with nanites (i.e. disassembling everything</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; within a few hundred meters and blasting everything within a few kilometers)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; is rather tricky, since it is extremely energy intensive. You need plenty</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; of energy to do the disassembly (essentially you have to break most molecular</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; bonds), and nanites are bad at making blast waves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I don't see why.  First of all, they'll be able to construct explosives</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; completely to order.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But where does the energy in the explosives come from? Remember conservation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of energy - when you make explosives you have to add energy beside the</i><br>
<i>&gt; chemical energy of the raw material to make the energetic but unstable</i><br>
<i>&gt; TNT molecules (electrical energy -&gt; chemical energy). The same is true for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the nanites - if they want to turn a lawn into a bomb, they need more</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy than will be released in the eventual blast.</i><br>
<p>
So they launch a few million square miles of solar power satellites. <br>
Admittedly, those are then vulnerable.  Do you really think energy is going to<br>
be a problem?  Maybe some of the black goo will be suicide exploding nanites,<br>
or battery nanites, imported from the Solar Collection Continent.  Current<br>
technology can always be taken as a lower limit.  Does nano imply fusion?  Ask<br>
some fusion researcher:  "If you had complete control over the molecular<br>
structure of matter, and could get anything built of available atoms just by<br>
wishing for it, could you build a powerful fusion reactor?"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'm far from an expert on explosives... but couldn't you get a bit of an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; improvement by detonating the ENTIRE bomb with electronic synchronization, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that the entire blast arrives time-on-target?  A shock wave is just that, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; wave.  So modern TNT is a huge splash made up a lot of little uncoordinated</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; splashes, while nanotech TNT is the precisely synchronized sum of all those</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; splashes.  Almost exactly like the distinction between a light bulb and a laser.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think something like this is done already, although not with the nano</i><br>
<i>&gt; precision you suggest. You might improve the current state a bit, but it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is likely not a quantum leap.</i><br>
<p>
I note we've gone from "Nanites can't handle blast waves" to "There won't be<br>
any *major* improvements."  :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Again, I'm trying to point out that a bit of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; imagination is necessary to see the enormous destructive potentials here.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; think we can safely extrapolate a *little* bit beyond current capabilities.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What I am trying to do is theoretical applied science - using known laws</i><br>
<i>&gt; of physics to discuss what can and cannot be done. You can always say that</i><br>
<i>&gt; unknown quantum effects will circumvent all that, but it is an empty</i><br>
<i>&gt; speculation until you show that these unknown effects really do exist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Note that we should speculate beyond current *capabilities*, not current</i><br>
<i>&gt; *physics*.</i><br>
<p>
When I invoke quantum nanotech, I'm taking something you can do with photons,<br>
and assuming you can do it with neutrons or protons or atoms.  I truly don't<br>
know how plausible that is.  Probably some of the stuff I mentioned will work,<br>
and some won't.  I'm not a physicist.  What I know of Heisenberg and Penrose<br>
makes it seem that neutrons and protons are subject to the same tricks as<br>
photons, but only over very short distances and very short times.  So, unlike<br>
photons, you need to be operating at a much lower scale.  How much lower, I do<br>
not know.  It would probably depend on the application.<br>
<p>
Feynman diagrams show a photon hitting an electron, but when we make a mirror,<br>
we don't know which electron the photon will hit.  Nanotech might let us<br>
invoke specific Feynman diagrams; fire one specific photon at one specific<br>
electron; position one specific nucleus to be hit by one specific neutron.<br>
<p>
Even if you can't quite do THAT, the ability to create precise crystals and<br>
precise positioning has moved you quite a bit Closer To The Bottom.  It's<br>
precise spacings of one type or another that let us play so many quantum<br>
tricks with photons.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Most of what you're saying has nanotech being less dangerous than modern</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technology.  I can't help but compare this to the old saw about "Atomic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technology may someday equal the capabilities of present bombs, but it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; unlikely to produce anything more dangerous."  [Paraphrase.]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, if that turns out to be history's judgement on my part in this thread,</i><br>
<i>&gt; so be it. But remember, there were people expecting a cure for the common</i><br>
<i>&gt; cold in the early 70's too...</i><br>
<p>
Underestimating a technology is Clark's Law.<br>
The kind of error distinguished scientists make.<br>
<p>
You named a timelike error, like nano arriving next Tuesday or in 2070.<br>
The kind of error bash young scientists make.<br>
<p>
Finally, I'm not history, but this argument can't happen without two sides. <br>
Which side is right is not relevant to the value of your contribution.<br>
