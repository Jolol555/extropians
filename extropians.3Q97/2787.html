<i>&gt; 4. In the absence of ethical motives, the benefits would outweigh the</i><br>
<i>&gt; costs for a nanotech power that chose to eliminate the competition or</i><br>
<i>&gt; prevent it from arising, provided it had the ability to do so.</i><br>
<p>
I have stayed out of this discussion until now because it is not<br>
really my field of interest, but I think an important underlying<br>
assumption in a lot of the discussion here is being missed.  Robin<br>
Hanson tried to get the point across at Extro 3--the assumption<br>
that nanotech devices will be owned/controlled/created by<br>
individual willful agents is far from given.  People--even nano-<br>
enhanced people--don't invent things; economies invent things, and<br>
economies control them.<br>
<p>
Compared to the kinds of self-replicating intelligent nanobeasts<br>
we are discussing here, the computer on my desktop is very simple.<br>
I've been working with PCs for 17 years; I've programmed individual<br>
logic gates and soldered cables on the low-abstraction end of things;<br>
I've normalized databases and connected CORBA objects on the high end;<br>
and I've programmed in over a dozen languages in between.  But I have<br>
to admit that I really don't completely understand the machine I'm<br>
typing this on, and I don't think anyone on the planet does either.<br>
I couldn't even begin to count how many different programmers' code<br>
is invoked between the physical act of my pressing the "A" key on my<br>
keyboard, and spots of ink in the shape of that "A" appearing on<br>
paper out of my printer.<br>
<p>
My ordinary desktop computer is already an emergent effect of dozens<br>
of hardware and software designers working on ambiguous specs,<br>
unexpected interaction, unanticipated inputs, unreliable devices.<br>
I feel like I control it more than I would, say, a child; but that's<br>
just a conceit.  To suppose that any one man/government/other agent<br>
would control the first nanotech devices is assuming too much.<br>
