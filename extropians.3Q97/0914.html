OK, I gotta point out a flaw in reasoning.<br>

Perry, I think you're looking back through rose-colored glasses here.  I<br>
haven't read Extropians in almost 5 years, and I distinctly remember you<br>
complaining back then about how bad the list had gotten.  "I didn't start<br>
this list to have to argue basic science and basic libertarianism!", or<br>
something along those lines.  So, the list might still have quite a bit of<br>
drivel, but I don't think it has gotten worse and I don't think it's fair<br>
to tell all the young'uns how great it was in the golden age.<br>
<p>
The problem of s/n in virtual communities is a hard one, and we haven't<br>
solved it yet (though not for want of trying).  Any day now I'm going to<br>
follow up on Robin's reference to the Low Golden Willow filter, and see if<br>
that works.  There was also some talk about an internal Extropy idea for<br>
rated posts, and Robin has a token payment mechanism that would be fun to<br>
try.  The filtering system that we had back in '92 didn't satisfy me in the<br>
end, I think because it seemed to break a sense of shared community.  And<br>
maybe the approach of yelling at people who post stupid things will work,<br>
though you have more energy and flair for it than I do.<br>
<p>
Later,<br>
Drea<br>
<p>
P.S. Does Extropy limit list membership to dues-paying members?  I would<br>
expect that to limit the people here just to troll.<br>
