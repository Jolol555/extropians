} &gt;Poverty is man-made, and the only agency with the power to create massive<br>

Poverty is natural in an isolated farm economy, period.  <br>
<p>
Look, I'm not saying that government creates prosperity, and saying<br>
"poverty has no causes" isn't true in a pure sense, but I think it's<br>
more accurate than viewing prosperity as the natural state and poverty<br>
always caused by some barrier.  There are conditions and processes which<br>
produce prosperity; poverty is self-sustaining.  Why did it take<br>
centuries to rebuild Europe's economy after the fall of the Roman<br>
Empire?  It wasn't because centralized government was getting in the<br>
way... it took work, long work, for Venice to build itself, stimulated<br>
by Constantinople, and in turn to stimulate the other cities of Europe.<br>

} &gt;has a drought, but this is not the massive global poverty that cannot<br>
} &gt;be due to nature, since nature provides more than enough resources.<br>

Not to reliably live past 40.  Not to have lots and lots of children.<br>
Not that simple agriculture is an improvement.  Whatever; agricultural <br>
poverty exists today, without recent cause.  Poor regions are because<br>
the processes of prosperity have not taken root, or have passed by, or<br>
don't work.  To blame government totally is simplistic.<br>
