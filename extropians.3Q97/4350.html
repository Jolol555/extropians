<i>&gt; danny asks:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; anyone know how long its been called dogstar?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems that the Greeks started calling it that shortly after (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; while) learning about it from the Egyptians and other nearby peoples.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That was going on during the 7th or 6th centuries BCE (600s and</i><br>
<i>&gt; 500s BC) give or take a century.  (The Greeks were just</i><br>
<i>&gt; emerging from a major cultural collapse, or "Dark Age", during</i><br>
<i>&gt; the two or three centuries before that time. First they came up</i><br>
<i>&gt; with Homer, and then they got interested in astronomy and</i><br>
<i>&gt; stuff.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This probably means that the Egyptians were calling it the Dog Star</i><br>
<i>&gt; before then.  The name derives from the fact that the star is set</i><br>
<i>&gt; in a constellation called the Great Dog.  Many constellation names,</i><br>
<i>&gt; especially animals in the zodiac, seem to go back as far as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; time writing first came into use (around 3000 BCE, give or take a</i><br>
<i>&gt; millenium), so they may have oral histories much much older and</i><br>
<i>&gt; we'll probably never know.  I don't know how old the name "The</i><br>
<i>&gt; Great Dog" is.  The constellations along the zodiac probably had</i><br>
<i>&gt; names long before the constellations in the other parts of the sky.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Great Dog is not part of the zodiac.  Orion was probably named</i><br>
<i>&gt; first (but after things like Leo and Scorpio and Virgo), and then</i><br>
<i>&gt; Canis Major as an afterthought.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sirius, by the way, means "Scorcher" and is thought to refer to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the hot weather of late summer that happens during the time of</i><br>
<i>&gt; year that Sirius rises just before Sol does.  This was called</i><br>
<i>&gt; the heliacal rising, and the Egyptians used to watch for it so</i><br>
<i>&gt; they'd know in advance when the season of Nile flooding was</i><br>
<i>&gt; about to begin.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Another good question to ask is what orientation the Dogon astronomical<br>
centers have with the pyramids at Giza. Since its been proven that<br>
egyptian monuments of the Giza era all are positioned to represent stars<br>
of the constellation Orion, and their own preoocupation with Sirius, as<br>
well as their domination of most of NE africa, there could be a link<br>
there, where the locals simply picked up on the religion of the<br>
Egyptians while acting as guides to Egyptian surveyors trying to place<br>
the proper postion of a Sirius monument with relation to Giza. Many more<br>
primitive cultures on the fringes of major civilizations tended to act<br>
as cultural and mythological packrats (witness the early Hebrews).<br>
