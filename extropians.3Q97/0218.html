Hmm. Any of the "us" that doesn't exist?<br>
I'll be glad to speak to you , one on one, whenever that happens.<br>
I see no reason to tilt at the "capitalism is the only accepted form<br>

Any proposition that easily falsifiable isn't much grist for conversation.<br>
<p>
Good luck. May your life serve you.<br>
Speaking only for myself, I'd say that sanity is like courage: <br>

can never be entirely sure that it's utterly gone.<br>
