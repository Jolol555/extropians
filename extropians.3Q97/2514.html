<p>
First point: there's energy in more than the bonds.  Diamond is higher<br>
energy than graphite on the surface; it's kinetics that prevent diamond<br>
from decaying into lower forms of carbon.  I don't know if these<br>
magnitudes are comparable to bond energies, but I don't think diamond<br>
and charcoal can be treated the same.<br>
<p>
Second point: I don't know if "energy" is entirely the right<br>
concept.  As I remember, reactions are thermodynamically favored if the<br>
free energy of the reaction is negative:<br>
dG= dH - T*dS<br>
G being free energy, H being enthalpy, T being temperature, and S being<br>
entropy.  I think I can safely say that diamond has a lower entropy than<br>
coal, meaning dG would be more positive, and less likely to happen.<br>
I don't know what the entropy of living organisms or nanite structures<br>
would be like.  Both lower than coal, presumably.<br>
<p>
Burning stuff gives energy, -dH, but turning it into diamond would be a<br>
negative dS, giving -dH - (-) giving -dH + something, which may well be<br>
a positive dG, and thus non-spontaneous.<br>
<p>
I have no intuition about buckytube nanites, which these days might seem<br>
easier to make anyway.<br>
<p>

<p>
Thank you!  Let's think about this.  What happens to charcoal if you<br>
light it in oxygen?  What happens to very finely powdered charcoal if<br>
you light it in oxygen?  I've said before that very small and rapidly<br>
moving particles of carbon residing in oxygen while exposed to UV seemed<br>
somewhat flammable.  Maybe nanites wouldn't spontaneously combust.  But<br>
methinkest that my first answer to Nicholas should have been "oh, I'm<br>
being attacked by a sea of gray goo?  I'll toss out a burning match..."<br>
Flamethrowers also exist.<br>
