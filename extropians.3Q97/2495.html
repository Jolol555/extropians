                         'The Blackbird Project'<br>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[This isn't an advertisement, by the way:  it's a request for participation ]<br>
<p>
I own an Atari Falcon (1993), which I use for everything I do now.<br>
<p>
I bought it in mint condition, for UKP 100 from a private forensics<br>
science consultant on CIX -- <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk">http://www.cix.co.uk</a> -- whose pride and joy it <br>
was. It's essentially a modest single-board 'supercomputer.'<br>
<p>
It was the last of Atari Corporation's own home computers.  It's a<br>
computer buff's machine.<br>
<p>
It's a multimedia, desktop publishing, graphic arts (I've got APEX), games<br>
and educational and business and Internet platform.  There are tens of<br>
thousands of solid programmes and utilities for it _for free_, and a<br>
thriving worldwide network of Atari computing enthusiasts.<br>
<p>
It has the German NVDI which triples the display speed, with beautifully<br>
scaleable font selections.<br>
<p>
Atari Corporation is now defunct -- bad marketing and financial management.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
This is the 'Great Idea':<br>
<p>
The Falcon looks like a big, slightly boxy but elegant standalone<br>
keyboard. That's it!  It outputs RF or video direct to TV, or to a mono<br>
monitor, or a graphics-quality monitor. It operates in up to 65,000<br>
colours from a palette of 262,144.<br>
<p>
[ OK, Russell, it's not a Silicon Graphics WorkStation! ]<br>
<p>
It runs Motorola 680x0 processors (CD Hades clones run 68060s).<br>
<p>
It has a solid OS and GIU, develooped from Digital Research's CP/M 68K in<br>
250k. of ROM, and it ordinarily has 1 to 14 megs of RAM.  You can do the<br>
Internet on a 1 meg. Falcon!  (On a 1 meg  ST with a single floppy,<br>
actually.  There are nice integrated WWW suites in just 250k of code. I've<br>
worked run thiogs this way! Quite feasible, if a bit heavy on<br>
disk-swapping, though).<br>
<p>
It loads the OS and GUI into RAM, and puts you  straight to<br>
the desktop with no disks at all!<br>
<p>
(The Germans at Magic! have an even more compact pre-emptive multi-tasking<br>
operating OS and GUI for it, coded in hand-optimized Motorola assembler,<br>
which is taught in European technical colleges, and running up to five<br>
times faster).<br>
<p>
It has full 32Mhz. 56001 DSP facilities, enabling downloadable SoftModems<br>
and protocol upgrades.  EXTERNAL I/O, too!<br>
<p>
It has a Motorola maths and floating-point co-processor.<br>
<p>
It has a socket for an Intel processor, for PC emulation.<br>
<p>
It has an internal expansion connector: upgrade to ISA and/or PCI.<br>
<p>
It has stereo digital sound in and out. Therefore it can handle voice<br>
command and 100wpm. text input too, given the software.<br>
<p>
It has SCSI II, LAN, RS232,  parallel, MIDI, expanded joysticks and<br>
controller ports, ROM cartridge port...<br>
<p>
It has an internal 1.44 meg. 3.5 floppy drive (which reads PC disks too).<br>
There's an existing world-wide network of online Atari enthusiasts.<br>
<p>
There's tens of thousands of programmes online, every conceivable kind of<br>
mature software (ST's have been around for over ten years), nearly all of<br>
it free or shareware.  There are top-flight commercial packages too.  Most<br>
of them are online.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
It doesn't 'fall over' all the time like Windoze, and it's easy to fix.<br>
<p>
It _doesn't_ have 'back doors', latent viruses, and routines which can be<br>
remotely activated to scan your hard drive and interleave outgoing data<br>
packets to a destination other than whatever you're accessing.<br>
<p>
It doesn't clutter up your living-room.<br>
<p>
And it goes like lightning.<br>
<p>
[ FX: "FLASH!!!" ]<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
So we redesign the case.<br>
<p>
We redesign the motherboard a bit.  Several people doing this already,<br>
especially Computer Direct in Alberta, Canada, the best in the <br>
business.<br>
<p>
      <a href="http://www.compdirect.com">http://www.compdirect.com</a><br>
<p>
 Shiraz Shivji (NeXt, Apple), designed the first ST then quit Atari <br>
 Corporation).<br>
<p>
We move the power supply (smallish -- loads of people produce such things<br>
for next to nothing) out into to the power cable (handy for differing<br>
local voltages) and input low DC voltage instead. A bit safer and easier to <br>
replace or upgrade, too.<br>
<p>
We removve the internal IDE or SCSI II Hard Drive.<br>
<p>
We substitute rear bays for:<br>
<p>
An optional plug-and-play internal ZIP drive<br>
<p>
An optional Hard Drive<br>
<p>
An optional internal plug-and-play CD-ROM.<br>
<p>
An optional radiomodem.<br>
<p>
We source good-quality clonemakers.  It's a relatively simple design, and <br>
there's a fair amount of spare capacity around ATM.<br>
<p>
We talk nicely to Motorola, asking them to keep the US government off our<br>
case, please!  And to provide organizational and technical support.<br>
<p>
      <a href="http://www.motorola.com">http://www.motorola.com</a><br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
We then have a basic, cheap Internet machine -- a WebTV and Network Computer <br>
_and_ a standalone personal computer/Work Station, with full expansion and <br>
upgrade capability to top Graphics Works Station level.<br>
<p>
The later Atari STe (same case but lesser internals) sold for 150 UKP retail. <br>
Everything's gotten cheaper since then.<br>
<p>
You can carry it home in a smallish box with a handle.<br>
<p>
Plug into the mains, connect to your TV aerial socket with a two-way<br>
pre-emptive switchbox, or into an SVGA monitor, as you wish.<br>
<p>
Plug an ordinary phone jackplug into the back.<br>
<p>
And you're off!!!<br>
<p>
Now sit back in your armchair:<br>
<p>
Point a cheap ($10?) optical wand at the screen to move the cross-hairs<br>
around, and click.<br>
<p>
You're onto the Internet!<br>
<p>
Add an internal ZIP drive?  No problem.<br>
<p>
Or an internal Hard Drive?  Of whatever capacity?  Easy-peasy.<br>
<p>
CD-ROM drive?  Easy.<br>
<p>
You want a memory upgrade to _1 gig_?  Computer Direct will oblige!<br>

64 MHZ 68040?  CD are selling them now -- 'Hades'<br>
<p>
Superscalar 120 MIPS 68060 model?  Again, Hades is available now from CD.<br>
<p>
ISA or PCI graphics card?  CD have them now.<br>
<p>
SVGA or WorkStation VDU?  Just plug-'n-play.<br>
Scanner? Printer?  _Virtually anything_, actually: no problem<br>
<p>
Voice command and control, with text input?  Built-in DSP, remember...<br>
<p>
Headsets off the shelf -- around ten dollars.<br>
<p>
Advice?  Support? Log onto hundreds of existing sites worldwide, run by<br>
knowledgeable Atari enthusiasts.<br>
<p>
Motherboard upgrades?  We recycle the old ones indo discount machines.<br>
<p>
PowerPC Mac board upgrades too?  No real problem!<br>
<p>
Actually, we can then emulate virtually every Personal Computer <br>
platform in the world.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
Now we go to the ISPs and telcos.  We say this:<br>
<p>
'The present market value of an Internet Service customer is around $1200.'<br>
<p>
"It's so cheap, you can _give_ the basic Blackbird to your new customers,<br>
as part of the deal for monthly-paid unlimited access service."<br>
<p>
"If you (the telcos) then enable spread-spectrum modem traffic with<br>
instant-connect via your phone lines, radio links, cables, we'll provide a<br>
reconfigured SoftModem download to handle it.  Then customers can 'blink' on <br>
and off the Internet, releasing line and exchange load."<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
What do Windoze do?  Kill everyone?  Try to put us all out of business?<br>
Bit obvious, that... Bit illegal ... Bit like a case for the trust-busters <br>
... Bit civilly-actionable, too ...  Class Actions ...<br>
<p>
Motorola is a major defense-related player, and CIA and NSA are tasked right <br>
now, to support American firms, with (inter alia) commercial intelligence) <br>
and comprehensive protection against interference.<br>
<p>
Motorola's American, right?<br>
<p>
Then, there's Iridium.... <br>
<p>
We _need_ this, for Democratic Agorism to succeed - and fast.<br>
<p>
(Singapore -- a tight little authoritarian jobbie -- is putting a Network<br>
Computer in every home right now.  Does the Western World -- including <br>
America and Europe --- really want to be left far behind?).<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
Why the name 'Blackbird'?  Bit of a liberty, really...  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
TITLE: '...quick beyond all dreams of speed...'<br>
<p>
TEXT: "Miles above, in the blue-black curve of space, the superstar of winged<br>
espionage makes its home. Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than<br>
a fleet of locomotives, and able to leap wide continents in a single bound<br>
is the SR-71 Blackbird. Named for its sooty [*midnight-blue*, actually -TH],<br>
heat-resistant titanium skin, which glows cherry-red as it flashes through<br>
the heavens at Mach 3.32, the successor to the ill-fated U-2 can photograph<br>
100,000 square miles of the earth's surface in less than an hour from a<br>
height of more than 85,000 ft. At the same time, its package of superadvanced<br>
SIGINT sensors can chart electronic battlefields and peer deep over a border<br>
with side-looking radar..."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From "The Puzzle Palace" by V. James Bamford; Sidgwick and Jackson, [1983].</i><br>
<p>
The 'Blackbirds' are powered by two giant Pratt and Whitney J58 <br>
turbo-ramjets.<br>
<p>
This series of planes was dreamed by Richard M. Bissell, jr. and built by<br>
Kelly Johnson and his team at Lockheed's Burbank Works, California, USA.<br>
<p>
<p>
One of my most treasured possessions is a photograph of a USAF SR-71 in<br>
serene high flight, signed -- just for me -- by Richard M. Bissell jr, <br>
anarchic administrator, polymath, genius.<br>
