I believe that the difference is not in the actual actions take, but in<br>
the procedure followed to decide about the action.  The idea is that if<br>
you have multiple people deliberate, argue and debate about the right<br>
thing to do, you are more likely to get a reasonable answer.  The extremists<br>
on all sides will hopefully cancel out.<br>
<p>
(Of course this will not always be the case, due to group dynamics,<br>
mob mentality, and such.  Particularly when dealing with emotional<br>
situations, people are easily swayed, even or especially as part of<br>
a group, to take an action that they later regret.  Recognizing this,<br>
people often have found that their preferred method is to select from<br>
among themselves someone judged exceptionally wise and fair, to give<br>
him power to make the decisions, and then to support those, even when<br>
they seem wrong in the heat of the moment.)<br>
<p>
So the justification for group-oriented decision making is that it is<br>
more likely to produce ethically correct answers.  And a system which<br>
produces more ethical answers can then be considered to be ethically<br>
superior to one which does not.<br>
