What's the problem? Someone has an experience they don't understand and<br>
comes up with a subjective explanation, others support them because it's<br>
fun, because they can make money out of it, because they can acquire<br>
power, because it fits their belief system, or because they're loons. This<br>
has always been the way with religions; what's so new about UFOs and<br>
circles? Every year or two I read alt.alien.visitors for a few weeks, but<br>
nothing ever changes; everyone who comes in looking for objective evidence<br>
is insulted by the believers and soon leaves. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Answers are not always the answer. ; )</i><br>
<p>
They are if you're more interested in achieving things than living in a<br>
fantasy world. Sadly, 90%+ of the Western population seem to prefer<br>
watching soap operas or 'X-Files' than wondering why we can't see any<br>
aliens out there, even though the answer to that question may be vital to<br>
our long-term survival. But, hey, at least they know who shot JR... <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is the problem with original Randian objectivism, it tries to negate</i><br>
<i>&gt; that rather than change people's "subjective" experience. No wonder it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; unpopular, only a small percentage of the population wants to live without</i><br>
<i>&gt; that!</i><br>
<p>
Who brought Rand into this discussion? I found 'Atlas Shrugged' highly<br>
amusing, but much preferred 'Illuminatus' as a work of philosophy. The<br>
only thing I really gained from Rand was her emphasis on consistent belief<br>
systems (at least to the extent that Godel allows them). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, IMO,   it condones and rationalizes an outrageous amount of  meaness</i><br>
<i>&gt; and enforces a stubborn passive message: " I cannot, will not, change,</i><br>
<i>&gt; emotionally". </i><br>
<p>
Objectivists are passive?!?!?! This is sure news to me (and so much for<br>
'communication beginning with listening and empathizing', huh?)<br>
<p>
You're right that a lot of assholes seem to use Rand's writing as a<br>
justification for their behaviour, but far more assholes use 'compassion'<br>
as a justification for pushing socialist programs to control those who<br>
disagree with them. Which is worse: an 'objectivist' asshole who screws up<br>
the lives of a handful of people or a 'compassionate' asshole who screws<br>
up the lives of millions? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is not colored with the richness</i><br>
<i>&gt; of life's most precious gifts.</i><br>
<p>
Which are, exactly? Most lists of 'life's most precious gifts' seem to be<br>
attempts to rationalize people's failure.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps it is nothing but a dangerous and costly mental game, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-righteous way to explain and exalt a sad lack of empathy and emotional</i><br>
<i>&gt; depth.</i><br>
<p>
ROTFL. The 'dangerous and costly mental game' of 'compassionate' socialism<br>
has destroyed more lives than objectivism ever could; I despise it<br>
precisely because I can empathise with the people who've suffered in the<br>
name of 'compassion'. Socialism has given it a real bad name.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Studies show that empathy and an ability to deeply identify with</i><br>
<i>&gt; other's suffering (compassion) is a "hardwired"  human trait, but  some</i><br>
<i>&gt; people seem to be born without it, or lose it because of neglect or abuse.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However it is an emotional skill that can be developed with practice. </i><br>
<p>
I'm not even going to comment on this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; guru suggests we don't need it, that we are above it. How pathetic an </i><br>
<i>&gt; example</i><br>
<i>&gt; of this theory she presents by her life example.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, right on! She should have been a good member of society just like<br>
everyone else and worked compassionately for the good of society rather<br>
than writing one of the best-selling novels this century. While 'Atlas<br>
Shrugged' is probably the worst great novel ever written, it certainly<br>
*is* a great novel because it deals with questions that few other people<br>
will even ask. <br>
<p>
Rand may have been an idiot in many ways, but she achieved far more than<br>
those who prefer to 'watch TV, have sex and smoke dope' ever will. From<br>
what I know of her life most of her problems came from *not* following her<br>
philosophy (e.g. ignoring the objective evidence that smoking might well<br>
kill her). She compassionately sacrificed herself to test her philosophy,<br>
and we learnt from her mistakes. You'd condemn her for that? <br>
