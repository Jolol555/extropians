Even though the frequency approach seems to support my answer, I don't<br>
think it works in general.  As a counter example, suppose the experiment<br>
was modified so that any clone made during the experiment is killed at the<br>
end of it.  This should not change any of the probabilities mentioned<br>
before, but it radically alters the long-run frequencies if the experiment<br>
is repeated. <br>
<p>
I will offer my own tentative analysis.  Suppose in a different experiment<br>
a subject is given a sleeping pill without being told what will happen<br>
during his sleep.  When he wakes up, the experimenter tells him this:<br>
<p>
"You are not a clone. However during your sleep a fair coin was tossed and<br>
if it landed head up an exact duplicate was made of you. What is the<br>
probability that the coin landed head up?"<br>
<p>
Compare that question to this one:<br>
<p>
"You are not a clone. However during your sleep a fair coin was tossed and<br>
if it landed head up a brain scan was made of you and stored in a<br>
computer. What is the probability that the coin landed head up?"<br>
<p>
or this one:<br>
<p>
"You are not a clone. However during your sleep a fair coin was tossed and<br>
if it landed head up a glass of water was boiled. What is the probability<br>
that the coin landed head up?"<br>
<p>
Now I think the correct answer to all these questions is 1/2. Once you<br>
know you are not a clone, the knowledge that a coin flip outcome may<br>
have caused some unobservable external material to be rearranged should<br>
not change the distribution of that outcome.<br>
<p>
But notice that the state of knowledge of the subject after the first<br>
question is the same as the state of knowledge of the subject of the<br>
original experiment after question 3, and therefore their answers must be<br>
the same. <br>
<p>
Let C stand for "I am a clone", H stand for "the coin landed head up", and<br>
K stand for the state of knowledge of the subject of the original<br>
experiment immediately after he wakes up. We have P(H | not C and K) =<br>
1/2. Also, it is obvious that P(C | H and K) = 1/2. Now we can deduce P(C<br>
<i>| K) and P(H | K) which are the answers to question 1 and 2.</i><br>
<p>
P(H and not C | K) = P(H | not C and K) P(not C | K) = P(not C | H and K) P(H | K)<br>
                   = 1/2 * P(not C | K) = 1/2 * P(H | K)<br>
which implies P(not C | K) = P(H | K)<br>
<p>
P(H and C | K) = P(C | H and K) P(H | K) = P(H | C and K) P(C | K)<br>
               = 1/2 * P(H | K) = 1 * P(C | K)<br>
<p>
Therefore 1 - P(C | K) = P(H | K) = 2 * P(C | K), and so P(C | K) = 1/3<br>
and P(H | K) = 2/3.<br>
<p>
This set of answers may seem counter-intuitive because you will observe<br>
the subject say "the probability that the coin will land head up is 1/2"<br>
before he goes to sleep and say "the probability that the coin landed head<br>
up is 2/3" immediately after he wakes up. However the alternative is<br>
equally counter-intuitive. If answer set A is correct, and suppose the<br>
copying process is slightly defective so that the original can tell that<br>
he is not a clone when he wakes up, then you will observe the subject say<br>
"the probability that the coin will land head up is 1/2" before he goes to<br>
sleep and say "the probability that the coin landed head up is 1/3"<br>
immediately after he wakes up.<br>
