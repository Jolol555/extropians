In a message dated 97-07-13 12:55:53 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 No, I beleive that engineers usually don't screw up big engineering. I<br>
 personally view engineers on one side and politicians and bureaucrats on<br>
 the other in a planet wide battle of building and destroying. That we<br>
 succeed in spite of politicians and bureaucrats says volumes about<br>
 engineers.<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;&gt;</i><br>
Well said!!<br>
<p>
There are only three types of people .  Makers...Takers...and Fakers.<br>
<p>
I forget who said that but I have not a shred of doubt that it's<br>
true...Engineers are Makers (when they're engineering)...&lt;as are Truck<br>
Drivers {shameless plug}&gt;...<br>
<p>
Who comprise the other two catagories?<br>
'<br>
I'll leave that as an exercise for the student..(hint: parisiteical<br>
politicians)<br>
