Don't get me wrong, the programming test is the most important factor.  We<br>
certainly didn't interview anyone who wasn't up to par on the test.  But we<br>
were hiring programmers to work on small teams with producers and artists,<br>
and to occasionally deal with clients.  Are you arguing that programming<br>
test results will predict a candidates ability to handle team dynamics and<br>
to support artists and designers?  Or are you arguing that those skills are<br>
more easily learned than programming skills?<br>
<p>
Perry and I are arguing in favor of our anecdotal evidence over research<br>
and statistics.  Not something I normally like to do, but somehow I think<br>
that certain kinds of jobs are harder evaluate in a statistical manner.<br>
