<p>
I was delighted that both Drexler and Minskey announced their arrangements<br>
for cryonic suspension. That will be one of the highlights for me.<br>
<p>

<p>
Thanks, Darren. But &lt;/hubris mode ON&gt; wait until next year! &lt;/OFF&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anders Sandberg has made an indelible impression on my memory with his talk</i><br>
<i>&gt;covering techniques to improve recall and the process of thought. What a</i><br>
<i>&gt;character. </i><br>
<p>
I know that many people, certainly including me, greatly enjoyed meeting<br>
the person behind those frequent transmissions from the distant star Sweden.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I did find the inclusion of a debate on the future of gender quite bizarre.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I fail to see that gender has any long-term future</i><br>
<p>
It certainly has a future as long-term as the introduction of<br>
nanotechnology, so I don't see why you would find it bizarre. The topic<br>
obviously interests many people and has much influence on our behavior and<br>
sense of self. Gender may change drastically over the coming centuries, but<br>
you need to provide an argument that it has no long-term future. You may be<br>
correct, but that's not obvious. For most of the next century at least, I<br>
see gender becoming increasingly individualized but not extinct.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;legs. Of the panelists, only Natasha actually commented on the FUTURE of</i><br>
<i>&gt;anything.</i><br>
<p>
I too would like to have heard more focus on the future from the other<br>
panellists. Chris nicely laid the biological foundation. It would have been<br>
good if Sharon had focused more on the psychology of future genders.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;couldn't grasp just what, in a posthuman world, I would need gender for. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;I had some sympathy with Kathryn Aegis, whose widely heard yet silent</i><br>
<i>&gt;statement was the loudest of all contributions. (She wasn't there.)</i><br>
<p>
I have to disagree. First, Kathryn's absence had nothing to do with a view<br>
that gender would be irrelevant. Secondly, the loudest contributions come<br>
not from silence but from participation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Greg Stock, by contrast, was fascinating. </i><br>
<p>
If you missed Greg's excellent talk and will be in the LA area a month from<br>
now, he may be speaking at the LA Gerontology Research Group at UCLA<br>
(second Monday of September).<br>
<p>
Thanks for you feedback, Darren. I appreciate all the encouraging comments<br>
which are boosting me to start thinking immediately about EXTRO 4.<br>
