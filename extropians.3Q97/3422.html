I have been a subscriber to Extropy since issue #4.  Despite a <br>
tendency towards callousness and an almost blind faith that the free-market <br>
will fix everything, I have continued to tap in to the extropian culture <br>
becuase despite the lopsidded nature of many extropians viewpoints, there <br>
is amazing cogitation going on here.  I would be a fool not to utilize <br>
that.<br>
<p>
BUT:<br>
<p>
Extropianism has as its basic tenet the goal of surpassing all limits <br>
to our freedom.  But as extropians rush to shed the tryannies of <br>
government, authority, death and taxes they rush to embrace the blind tyranny <br>
of evolution and the free-market.  You have accepted the slavery of <br>
natural selection and market pressures to get ajob.  the extropian tyrannical <br>
maxim is: Evolve or die!  Please witness the following posts made in <br>
the last 24 hours:<br>
<p>
Andrea Gallagher:<br>
<p>
I worry about the people who are completely excluded in participating <br>
in our economy by drug laws, sub-standard education, and welfare traps.  <br>
Fix those problems and I bet we could handle your hard cases.<br>
<p>
Me: Who said the solution is geting these people back to work?  I want <br>
to eliminate mandatory work altogether.  Prosperity w/o drudgery is my <br>
goal!  Pass the joint!<br>
<p>
QueenMuse:<br>
<p>
The "LIVNGRY" you speak of has "enabled" the corfters for JUST long <br>
enough to destroy their livelihood! As with Native Americans, it also sets <br>
up a system where the government has<br>
control, a hand out, and the power to provide - and the populace is<br>
"disenfranchised" - or "dis-empowered". I do have compassion for these <br>
people, and it is sadly disturbing, becauseas your post suggests, the <br>
problem nor the solution is simple to solve.<br>
But facts show:  we provide for people in need, we also rob them of <br>
theirdignity!! It is a humanitarian's nightmare.<br>
<p>
Me:  All I can say here is its all nonsense.  You are saying people <br>
must work work work!  How puritan of you!  Yes, I did see the movie <br>
transpotting.  Those people have no incentive to better themselves.<br>
<p>
Lee Daniel Crocker:<br>
<p>
If one lacks the necessary tools to survive in that culture ( and by <br>
your description they will) then Evolution will be as unkind today as it <br>
is on our homeless little brothers in the streets..<br>
<p>
Me: Wouldn;t be nice just for once to not have to worry about <br>
constantly updating your skills just to survive?  What a bitch.  Escape the <br>
blind laws of evolution.  I want my MTV and Liesure!!!<br>
<p>
<p>
Lee Daniel Crocker:  Evolution is not "kind" or "unkind"; it is <br>
nothing more than a mathematical consequence of a certain set of initial <br>
conditions: replication, mutation, competition.  Far better to understand and <br>
make use of an existing effectthan to try to fight it.  You might as <br>
well try fighting pi.<br>
<p>
Me: What a defeatist attitude for an extropian.  Fuck Pi!  If I have <br>
to struggle for billions of years with String Theory or wormhole physics <br>
to beat pi, I will!<br>
<p>
<p>
Accept *NO* Limits!!<br>
