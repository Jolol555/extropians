If you, like me, you are an advocate of spontaneous order, then you have no<br>
doubt tried explaining why anarchy has advantages over hierarchy.  Most<br>
pro-authoritarian people just don't get it, you could explain away for the<br>
rest of your life and they'll simply never understand.  I've been thinking<br>
about this for a long time and have finally come to a conclusion; there is a<br>
direct and measurable correlation between intelligence and pro-authoritarian<br>
views.<br>
<p>
Everyone has an authoritarian breaking point, this is the point at which a<br>
situation becomes to complex and the only apparent solution is to appoint an<br>
authority figure.  A coercive and authoritative solution has a direct<br>
correlation with intelligence and knowledge.  An average person's<br>
_authoritarian point_ would probably be crime, most people cannot think of a<br>
non-government solution to crime, and see the government as a 'necessary<br>
evil.'<br>
<p>
If you're looking at society, then complexity can be seen as the potential<br>
for disaster.  If we presume everyone has the ability to kill one other<br>
person, we have a stable situation.  If you increase the potential for<br>
disaster, everyone has the ability to kill 10 other people.  At this point<br>
with a lack of information and/or intelligence you may think everyone would<br>
kill each other.  You hopefully don't, but what if the disaster potential of<br>
10 is increased to a hundred, a thousand, or a million?  At which point does<br>
the system complexity lead you to appoint authority?<br>
<p>
Nanotechnology has a high disaster potential, so the initial reaction is to<br>
use coercive or authoritarian methods to reduce this potential.  But just as<br>
we see alternatives to government, where millions fail to understand, we can<br>
also find non-authoritarian solutions within the coming era of<br>
nanotechnology.<br>
