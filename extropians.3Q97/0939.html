I've been giving some thought to Neanderthals, language, art, and their<br>
extinction.  I do see a way that a lack or art could have put Neanderthals<br>
(or any other hominids) at a major disadvantage vs. Sapiens, if Sapiens was<br>
indeed the only one to care about art.  It enlarges on my suggestion earlier<br>
that Neanderthals were held back by socialization rather than stupidity or<br>
inability to communicate.  Since this is just an idea, I'm sorry I can't<br>
provide many references.  <br>
<p>
I hope I'm not too much of a TC (trepanned chihuahua) here :-)<br>
<p>
One suggestion for the value of art is that it serves for sexual selection.<br>
 This is certainly the case for a few other species; bower birds strive to<br>
build beautiful nests and mockingbirds strive to develop large vocabularies<br>
of mocked songs.  It's also at least part of the game for humans today; we<br>
dress up, dance, get flowers, sing love songs, etc. as part of courtship.<br>
 Let's suppose that other hominid species used other things, like appearance,<br>
for sexual selection.  <br>
<p>
Now Neanderthals, and presumably Erectus, had a social organization similar<br>
to other social great apes - relatively small groups of tribes.  Presumably<br>
these groups related to each other as other apes did - minimally or with<br>
hostility, save for occaisional exchange of mating partners.  I do have to<br>
mention bonobos as an exception, in which different groups do often get<br>
along.<br>
<p>
After all, if one male Neaderthal encountered another from a different tribe,<br>
what would they have to gain by interacting?  They're unlikely to have much<br>
to trade - both will have similar, limited, technologies and hence similar<br>
items.  If they can communicate (not a given), they could exchange knowledge,<br>
but most knowledge will be of their own ranges and it's obviously<br>
double-edged to tell a potential rival how to forage or survive in your own<br>
territory.  Good general knowledge is pretty hard to come by and even harder<br>
to check - if one gave another a bum tip, he wouldn't know until much later,<br>
and checking tips often can be risky even later.<br>
<p>
Now let's suppose that proto-sapiens developed an sexual selection for art<br>
during the isolation in which the species sapiens developed.  Rampant sexual<br>
selection during speciation is quite possible, particularly if the species is<br>
pretty well adapted to the conditions it's in.  Irish deer, whose horns got<br>
so large they drove themselves into extinction, are an example.  It would<br>
explain our funny voice boxes - bad for choking, but real good at carrying a<br>
tune.<br>
<p>
Now what happens when two Sapiens from different tribes meet?  Unlike the<br>
Neanderthals, they *do* have something to trade - their art.  They can swap<br>
stories, share tunes, recount jokes, trade clothes (maybe), share designs,<br>
etc.  If they do, each goes home to his or her tribe a little better equipped<br>
to joust in the sexual selection.  Plus, they can check the traded items at<br>
the point of transaction - is the song catchy, the story moving, the design<br>
pretty?  They've got a built-in protection from shoddy merchandise.<br>
<p>
Now while humans don't always "all get along", this provides an opportunity<br>
for cooperation between members of different groups quite absent in any<br>
modern ape, and possibly in any other hominid as well.  While other hominids<br>
might as well be mildly xenophobic (nothing to gain from dealings), sapiens<br>
benefit from having friends in other tribes to keep an ear out for the latest<br>
trends, as it were.  So instead of family groups or small tribes of up to a<br>
few dozen, humans are organized into meta-tribes with hundreds or perhaps<br>
even thousands of members.<br>
<p>
The real killer, of course, comes from the combination of poetry/song/epigram<br>
with verbal meaning - the oral tradition.  Over time, you will tend to see<br>
catchy and meaningful combine.  These oral traditions travel freely over the<br>
meta-tribes.  While oral traditions do contain a lot of drek, people want to<br>
teach their children true and useful things and so oral traditions contain a<br>
lot of truth as well.<br>
<p>
So what happens when the isolation is breached and Sapiens faces off with<br>
Erectus, Heidelbergensis, Neanderthal, and possibly other hominids we don't<br>
know about?  Well, the other hominids were apparently stronger; those brow<br>
ridges were probably handy in a fight, and Erectus at least might well have<br>
been a better runner.  But their small isolated social groups can't mantain<br>
nearly the knowledge base of the Sapiens meta-tribes, and based on human<br>
history, those meta-tribes will tend to get together if it comes to a fight.<br>
 Neanderthal was probably more than a match for Sapiens 1-on-1; but 1-on-10<br>
and Neanderthal would have been bird food.  They'd have been outcompeted<br>
and/or outfought.<br>
<p>
This doesn't require that the other hominids lack languages.  Neanderthal in<br>
particular had quite a big brain.  Human children spontaneously invent<br>
languages to communicate with each other if not provided with any (and<br>
sometimes even then).  That kind of linguistic facility would have been quite<br>
handy for Neanderthal or any other hominid, and they might well have had it.<br>
 It's just that without art they would tend not to have a social system that<br>
would best make use of their ability to communicate.<br>
<p>
*End of main point*<br>
*Major digression and TC alert*<br>
<p>
As I write this, my Warcraft II game manual sits on the table in front of me.<br>
 (Yeah, yeah, I have a real useful life)  As I look at the picture of the<br>
evil orcs, I realize they are depicted with brow ridges, protruding jaws, and<br>
a low forehead.  They eat meat, they are violent and xenophobic, they are<br>
inhumanly strong, and they have no appreciation for beauty.  In other words,<br>
they are passable caricatures of non-Sapiens hominids, as I am hypothesizing<br>
them.  (the protruding canines are definitely wrong, and the green skin is<br>
pretty unlikely).  Isn't it interesting how readily we assign an imaginary<br>
evil so many features of our dead rivals?<br>
<p>
No doubt Sapiens was equally unsavory to them.  I'm sure our heads would have<br>
appeared deformed, and our bodies sickly.  Our preoccupation with art would<br>
no doubt have seemed insane to them - humming to ourselves, arranging<br>
seashells on strings (and I'll bet Neanderthal at least would have been smart<br>
enough to notice).  So we saw them as orcs and they saw us as deformed<br>
residents of an insane asylum.  No wonder we didn't interbreed much, if at<br>
all.<br>
