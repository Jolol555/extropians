<i>&gt;With some reservations, I really liked the British version of 'The</i><br>

With you on that one - excellent, idiosyncratic artwork, and an<br>
imaginative scenario.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; But I think you'll find that those who wrote them (Alan Moore, David</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Gibbons, and the Scotsman whose name I've forgotten who writes the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 'Invisibles', another more recent good comic) are pretty solidly</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; left-wing. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, but left-wing in the Iain Banks sense; more like anarcho-socialists</i><br>
<i>&gt;than authoritarian socialists. I think I have far more in common with them</i><br>
<i>&gt;than with, say, the avowedly capitalist Tory party.</i><br>
<p>
Absolutely!  Another one is the Scottish S-F writer Ken McLeod (Star<br>
Fraction and The Stone Canal).  He actually knows some of the folks in<br>
the Libertarian Alliance here in the UK (they figure in the dedication<br>
of Star Fraction)!<br>

<i>&gt;2000AD left wing? Some of the 80s stories certainly leant that way,</i><br>
<i>&gt;particularly those by the authors in question, but I'd have a hard time</i><br>
<i>&gt;seeing Judge Dredd as left-wing (though I suspect he'd have loved to work</i><br>
<i>&gt;in Stalinist Russia...)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Ah well, there's the subtlety of British irony for you!  I think the general idea was<br>
to make fun of American 'cultural imperialism', and extrapolate<br>
its horrendous possibilities (as they see them), while at the same time<br>
pointing to how we are all suckers for it at the same time.<br>
