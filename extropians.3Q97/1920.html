I'd be nervous.  Algernon's Law - is choline hard to synthesize during<br>
pregnancy?  Why wouldn't it be supplied naturally?  Are we sure that choline<br>
isn't just activating one kind of memory which grows at the expense of others?<br>

I refer to the 'Net as my ELTM - Extended Long-Term Memory.<br>
<p>
Once, my father accidentally destroyed a large section of my files, including<br>
most of my old childhood work such as fourth-grade book reports.  It felt<br>
horrible, as if that part of my life had simply been obliterated.  Human<br>
memory is so mucky and fragile that we Information-Age types use computers as<br>
"ontological stabilizers".  (Which term I invented, on the fly, without<br>
realizing it, in what had previously been an ordinary conversation.  Man, did<br>
I get a strange look...)<br>
