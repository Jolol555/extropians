I strongly disagree, I think that's exactly the question.<br>

I strongly agree, not many would say that.<br>
            <br>
<p>

           <br>
<p>
You want a precise definition of "exist", I think that would be nice too but  <br>
obviously I don't have one. Not being a follower of Logical Positivism I most <br>
certainly don't think the lack of such a definition means the question is  <br>
meaningless. Little of our knowledge is in the form of definitions and none <br>
of the really important stuff is, it's in the form of "like this" and "not <br>
like this". I maintain that it is an undeniable fact that in everyday life we  <br>
mean *something* by the word "exist", even if we can't say exactly  what it <br>
is.  My question, is the Mandelbrot set "like that"? Can I safely  place the <br>
Mandelbrot set in the mental category that happens to have the name "things <br>
that exist", or will doing that lead to a contradiction at some point?<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I mean, if somebody told me "Yes, the Mandelbrot set does exist.",                 </i><br>
<i>        &gt;how much wiser would I be </i><br>
           <br>
<p>
I think you'd be a lot wiser. If you grant that I am "real" then it would  <br>
mean anything that is consistent would be as real as I am, whatever the  <br>
definition of the word. It would mean there is no difference between an <br>
actual mind and a potential one.<br>
<p>
I don't think there is any question that neurons cause consciousness, I can <br>
demonstrate on myself that if my neurons are changed, then my state of  <br>
consciousness changes. But what else besides  me is conscious in  my brain, <br>
or in a rock for that matter. Some think it's all a mater of interpretation.<br>
<p>
To communicate with another person the interpretation is straightforward,  <br>
if the person smiles he is happy, if they make sounds with their mouth we  <br>
find meaning in them from another interpretation, the rules of grammar,  <br>
but some, such as Moravec go as  far as to  say that a interpretation must <br>
exist that can  find a mind even in a rock. The reason we can't detect them <br>
is that we're too stupid. The interpretation is so hideously complex that as <br>
a practical matter their workings are indistinguishable to us from random <br>
thermal vibrations.<br>
<p>
As near as I can tell, Moravec thinks that a mind is the one thing that has <br>
it's own self consistent interpretation inherent within it; in fact that <br>
seems to be the definition of a mind, although you would still need an <br>
interpretation to make contact with it.<br>
               <br>

<p>
You know, I could have written exactly the same sentence. I could be wrong <br>
but I seem to mean something by all this but I'm not sure exactly what it is. <br>
If anybody does know what the hell I'm babbling about I'd appreciate it if <br>
they'd drop me a line and tell me.              <br>
