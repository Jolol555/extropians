I read Holly's post with some empathy.  Anyone who sets high <br>
standards for their personal growth and achievement is going to <br>
experience periods of frustration.  We see so many possibilities and <br>
yet are endowed with only one body and one mind!  <br>
<p>
You are right, Holly.  No one person could possibly keep up with all <br>
of the scientific and technical progress, and no one person can <br>
possibly learn all of these skills in a lifetime, not if one is going <br>
to use them in any significant manner.  That is why it is <br>
so very important for us to work together in forums such as this <br>
list, Extropy Institute, or local groups.  Each of us has core <br>
abilities and developed areas of knowledge that can be combined with the <br>
abilities and knowledge of others to reach goals that none of us <br>
could accomplish individually.  Why should each of us run ourselves <br>
ragged trying to aquire every skill, when we can each contribute a piece of <br>
the whole, remaining focused on our individual strengths and developing <br>
them to their utmost.  <br>
<p>
Extropians value competition, but I think that sometimes leads <br>
us to try to "go it alone" instead of reaching out to the persons <br>
nearby who can contribute to and enhance our lives and our work.  As <br>
we get to know each other better and to understand what each of us is <br>
capable of, the more possibilities will emerge for collaborative <br>
work.  And collaborative play!  <br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
