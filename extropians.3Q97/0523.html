Yes, that is an interesting observation.<br>

Or they will all buy into the Hedonistic Imperative (<a href="http://www.hedweb.com">http://www.hedweb.com</a>)<br>
and not bother about history any longer.<br>
I don't know. If it turns out that the DA holds water then the question about<br>
the reference class becomes very pressing. You are right that there might<br>
be an interpretation other than doom soom. This is a problem I would<br>
like to think think about if nobody sinks the DA.<br>

Mr. Bostrom--<br>
<p>
I just read your paper on the Doomsday Argument (not as closely as I should<br>
have).  I am intrigued by the reference class "people who know their<br>
approximate place in human history".  There was nobody in this reference<br>
class before the last century.  Perhaps this implies that with 90%<br>
probability, everyone will forget their history sometime between 2010 and<br>
3000 AD.  Could some combination of a Singularity and interstellar migration<br>
render the past infomationally inaccessible, and convince most people that<br>
the human race endures from everlasting to everlasting?<br>
