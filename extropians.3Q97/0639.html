Not really true.  Bones of Neanderthal children show sign of heavy use (as<br>
compared to Cro-Magnon), as I understand, so at least children were treated<br>
differently.  There were certainly physiological differences (shoulder<br>
strength, larynx shape).  There *could* have been significant psychological<br>
or cultural differences as well.  We wouldn't know; those things don't<br>
fossilize well.<br>
<p>
Neanderthals might not have made art by inclination, or they might have<br>
lacked the free time and security to do art.  Alternatively, perhaps art only<br>
develops in fairly large societies (humans go to great length to communicate,<br>
even over great distance) and Neanderthals didn't do that.  It's even<br>
possible that Neanderthals did art and we just haven't found any yet.  <br>
<p>
It's very fortunate that we have been able to deduce the genetic connection<br>
between Neanderthals and ourselves but a real pity that there aren't any<br>
left.  It would be very useful to observe them or even talk to them.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, I consider the original discovery that started this thread to<br>
be an incredible achievement.  From a few bones, tens of thousand of years<br>
old, we are able to deduce behavior in populations nearly a million years<br>
ago.  Wow.  Who needs magic?<br>
