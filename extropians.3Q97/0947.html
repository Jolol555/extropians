<p>
I have thought about it and I strongly disagree with your assessment on a<br>
number of levels.<br>
<p>
First of all, I disagree with the concept in principle.  The abuses of a<br>
tiny minority do not justify retribution against the entire population.<br>
And I find the IRS regulations to be mostly irrelevant when applied to the<br>
hypothetical scenario you describe above.  I'm not sure I even understand<br>
how being an independent contractor makes migrant workers sudden victims of<br>
abuse.<br>
<p>
Secondly, I disagree with your statements as a matter of reality.  The IRS<br>
could not give a damn about the miserably small amount of tax revenues (if<br>
any) generated by migrant farm workers.  The IRS *does* care a great deal<br>
about the tax revenue possibilities of the professional independent<br>
contractor segment<br>
which often generates taxable income in the 30+% range.  I don't think it<br>
would be a stretch to say that what the IRS really wants is greater control<br>
over the taxability and finances of independent contractors, who by their<br>
nature enjoy significantly more (theoretical) flexibility in such matters.<br>
<p>
And lastly, you make it sound like companies that hire people as<br>
independent contractors are some type of new "bogeymen".  The crimes of the<br>
IRS far, far exceed that of the companies they purportedly accuse.<br>
It is simply inexcusable for the IRS to punish an entire industry and<br>
professional working population based on an anecdotal situation involving<br>
migrant workers.<br>
<p>
<p>
Yet another independent professional,<br>
