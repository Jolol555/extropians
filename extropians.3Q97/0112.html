Given we're talking about reprogramming technologies that don't exist <br>
yet, I'd suggest another, possibly simpler, technology from science <br>
fiction. In Iain M Banks non-extropic but nevertheless <br>
entertaining "Culture" novels, their communist-utopian society deals <br>
with persistant violent criminals (or says it would, it's not clear if <br>
it's ever had to) by assigning a 'slap drone' to them. A small but <br>
physically powerful expert-system/sub-AI robot follows them everywhere <br>
and physically prevents them from injuring others. Apart from that, they <br>
are left at liberty.<br>
<p>
If they get fed up with this, they can always volunteer to have their <br>
psychology altered to a 'sane' Culture standard, or just leave Culture <br>
controlled space.<br>
<p>
Seems a justifiable approach to me,<br>
