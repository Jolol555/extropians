How many more times to I have to say this: *MARCEL HIMSELF STATED THAT<br>
THIS PARTICULAR PHOTO SHOWS THE DEBRIS HE PICKED UP AT THE RANCH*. Go read<br>
"The Roswell Incident" by Berlitz and Moore, the book which started this<br>
whole Industry. If Marcel is telling the truth then that is a photo of the<br>
real debris. If he's not, then his entire testimony is suspect and the <br>
story falls apart anyway.<br>
<p>
You can claim that Marcel is a liar, you can claim that Berlitz and Moore<br>
are liars, but if you believe the Roswell Industry then that photo is<br>
*real*. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The story additionally</i><br>

<i>&gt;have never gone out.</i><br>
<p>
Their concern wasn't with the balloon, it was with the 'flying disc' which<br>
was attached to the balloon. Which wasn't standard issue on weather<br>
balloons of the period. <br>
