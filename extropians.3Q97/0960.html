Yes, I read it a couple years ago. Maybe <br>
choose a more descriptive name, like "Realistic Optimism" or such.<br>
Unfortunately, it is not perceived as more than wishful thinking <br>
by those who have not read a definition, Gary Stix for example. His <br>
infamous *Scientific American* report "Nanotechnology: Waiting for the <br>
Breakthroughs" (April, 1996) contains wording to the effect that "..the <br>
dynamic optimism school of technological forecasting..." which I am fairly<br>
sure he got from the Extro site.<br>
  The central thing I find disagreeable is others telling me how and what to <br>
think, yourself included.<br>

Sure, any time.<br>
