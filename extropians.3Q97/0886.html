Hello, Refreshingly Skeptical and Intelligent Fellow Extropians....<br>
<p>
I am Rudi Hoffman in Daytona Beach, FL, and I have been quietly reading these<br>
outstanding posts for about a year...I am so damn glad that there are so many<br>
sharp people out there whose orientation is extropian, and whose biases<br>
reflect my own.<br>
<p>
Knowing how we are excited about technology and how it can expand our<br>
effectiveness, I just wanted to post a brag about my new Compaq Presario<br>
4814, obtained thru the magic of signing a Office Depot "Don't even bother to<br>
pay for it for six months plan"...cooolll!...obtained about 6 hours ago...I<br>
could not sleep I was so excited about playing with it..:)<br>
<p>
Anyway, it is a screamer!  233 MMX, a 100 meg Zip drive, 24 speed CD rom, 32<br>
MB SyncDram (How is this different than regular RAM, I wonder?), a 56K modem,<br>
and an astonishing 6.5 GIG hard drive. And a 17 inch moniter with seamlessly<br>
integrated speakers!<br>
<p>
<p>
I want you tech freaks to drool a bit, if you don't mind:)<br>
<p>
I think I have more computing power than a government could have afforded<br>
perhaps 25 years ago...maybe 35... <br>
<p>
Anyway, Drexler, etc. seem to be right about the costs of storage and<br>
computing power continuing to plummet...<br>
<p>
Just finished a tape called "Being Digital" by Negriponti...great, inspiring<br>
stuff.<br>
<p>
I correlated it with Gate's "The Road Ahead" (Another enlightening read) and<br>
Drexler's "Engines of Creation " and "Unbounding the Future"...<br>
<p>
We are definately leading increasingly "Science Fiction" lifestyles...<br>
<p>
What a GREAT time to be alive...<br>
<p>
On another thread, I wanted to add my belief / observation / opinion that<br>
psylocybin mushrooms may or may not have added to the evolution of the<br>
race...but they have added a great deal to my personal evolution.<br>
<p>
One of the few things, besides technology, skepticism, and cryonics, that I<br>
am "evangelical" about.  They should be a "REQUIRED COURSE" in college...I am<br>
only half joking about this.  They are great!  This posting may keep me from<br>
being president one day...unless we have become VERY Libertarian!<br>
<p>
Warmly,<br>
<p>
Rudi<br>
