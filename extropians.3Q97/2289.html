So you don't think Marshall Savage's scheme to use OTECs to raise<br>
lots of spirulina and dump some of it (with the attendant carbon)<br>
to the ocean bottom will help?  The scheme is described in his book<br>
THE MILLENIAL PROJECT along with several other poetically-portrayed<br>
engineering marvels. (Savage's book is also loaded with the most<br>
entertaining flights of disasturbation, but I have no trouble<br>
discounting that stuff.  He's just trying to get people motivated,<br>
so I just pretend I'm reading Steven King.)<br>
<p>
One problem I have in thinking about these things is that everytime<br>
I try to worry about global warming, I recall that we have recently<br>
had four major glacial periods, each about 100,000 years long,<br>
punctuated by four interglacial periods, each about 10,000 years<br>
long. We've been in the current (fourth) interglacial for about<br>
10,000 years. Now I must confess that I haven't delved into the<br>
primary geological research behind these numbers, but if anyone on<br>
the list is familiar with this stuff I'd be fascinated to hear<br>
more.<br>
<p>
Personally, I lump most forecasting discussions of global ecology<br>
in with forecasting discussions of macroeconomics.  They seem to<br>
be about equally difficult, and the hit rate of opinions of experts<br>
in these fields seems to be pretty close to chance.  Local ecology<br>
and microeconomics I treat with somewhat less skepticism.<br>
<p>
Trying to *think* about global ecology and macroeconomics is a<br>
tremendously valuable guide for helping me find gaps in my education,<br>
though, so I do that all the time. I just don't have much confidence<br>
in the opinions I develop along the way.<br>
<p>
As an unrelated sidepoint, I'll mention that I've found Daugherty's<br>
posts considerably more comprehensible after he explained to us<br>
that what he calls "sophisticated conspiracy theorists" envision<br>
the conspiracies they discuss as the Dark Side of spontaneous order:<br>
implicit understandings that arise in the collective subconscious<br>
of the old boy network.  Admittedly, this still sounds wacky, but<br>
not nearly as wacky as the idea that successful global conspiracies<br>
are deliberately planned and constructed (the Illuminatus! fantasy).<br>
