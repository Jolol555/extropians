        From what I saw at the conference, the Prometheus Project looks<br>
pretty promising.  I particularly liked Paul's [Wakfer] position on the<br>
potential placing of dewars in hospitals for patients who have decided to<br>
be frozen.  If hospitals had their own dewars, the freezing process could<br>
take place much quicker than having to be shipped to a faraway facility.<br>
Also, the Prometheus Project has plans to set up (in the future) a group of<br>
people who will be able to familiarize the client with his surroundings<br>
upon reanimation.  I quite appreciated Paul's honesty as he was explaining<br>
his project; he was very open about the fact that cryonics is by no means a<br>
sure thing.  He could have glossed over the cryonics industry by claiming<br>
that reanimation would be inevitable, but he treated it as a "best<br>
alternative" situation...a stand which I really respected.  When *I* sign<br>
up for cryonic suspension, I think that I will go with the Prometheus<br>
Project...it looks very stable (lots of funding) and Paul is a reputable<br>
physicist and businessman to boot.<br>
