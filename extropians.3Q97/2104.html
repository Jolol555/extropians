Ok, I'll tell you my crazy idea.<br>
<p>
The closest thing we have to a theory of quantum gravity and figuring out <br>
what things are like at less than 10^-33 cm is Superstring Theory. <br>
It postulates that all "elementary" particles are made up of one dimensional <br>
strings that vibrate in 10 dimensions of space-time, 9 of space and 1 of time.  <br>
The reason we don't notice the other 6 spatial dimensions in everyday life is <br>
that they are curled up so tightly that they only become significant when you <br>
approach the Plank Length. <br>
<p>
It is possible to pack an infinite number of 3 dimensional objects in a <br>
9 dimensional space and have all the objects be arbitrarily close to each <br>
other, in fact just 4 dimensions would do. This means that an infinite number <br>
of objects could communicate with each other in an arbitrarily short amount <br>
of time, even if the objects are not infinitely small and even if the signal <br>
only travels at the speed of light, or even less.<br>
<p>
So now we have a God who is limited by the Plank time to a finite clock speed <br>
of only 5.38 * 10^44 ticks a second, but who has an INFINITE ( and not just <br>
astronomical) number of processors running in parallel. He can perform an <br>
infinite number of calculations in just one tick of His clock.<br>
<p>
