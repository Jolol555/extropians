<p>
I think "Realistic Optimism" would elicit only a "huh?" from most people.<br>
The reactions I have mostly heard to dynamic optimism have mostly been<br>
positive, *especially* when accompanied by a brief explanation.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;infamous *Scientific American* report "Nanotechnology: Waiting for the </i><br>

<p>
Your first sentence above suggests a universal response. How many cases are<br>
you basing that on? It does not match my experience, though my experience<br>
usually involves using the term and explaining it. I'm not terrible<br>
concerned about Stix's usage, since his whole article was an irresponsible<br>
piece of slash-and-burn attack on nanotechnology. (Scientific American even<br>
managed some kind of apology for Stix piece on the web, thanks to Ralph<br>
Merkle's incisive response.)<br>
<p>
Thanks for telling me about your experience with the term. I'd like to get<br>
a better idea of whether you are talking about one or two cases or many. If<br>
"dynamic optimism" really does produce a negative response according to<br>
several people, I would have to consider renaming it. However, I wouldn't<br>
rename it simple because some people occassionally misunderstand it, not<br>
having ever read a definition or explanation. *That* can happen to any term.<br>
<p>
Onward!<br>
