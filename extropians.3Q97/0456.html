     James Rogers queried:<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     "Why would the next 100 years be any more special than the last <br>
     million?  Or the next million?  On someone elses timetable it should <br>
     make no difference."<br>
     <br>
     I respond:<br>
     <br>
     Perhaps I'm still drifting in my fantasy haze from yesterday's viewing <br>
     of Contact but I think Sagan (Zemeckis?) pose an interesting theory in <br>
     that only since the middle of this century have we been sending <br>
     broadcast signals that could travel out of this solar system and reach <br>
     other systems over a period of decades.  It may be akin to the tired, <br>
     semi-conscious scientist when his orangutan utters what sounds like an <br>
     intelligible sound, he snaps to full alertness.  <br>
     <br>
     This new film, more than any other sci-fi flick in several years <br>
     (since Spielberg eeked it out of me with Close Encounters as a kid), <br>
     touched me at the very core of my being.  <br>
     <br>
     Insignificance is a relative thing but maybe in this vast nothingness, <br>
     best efforts are acknowledged.  Maybe someone's just waiting for us to <br>
     wake up.  Loneliness and communion might not be a human-centric thing.<br>
     <br>
     Regards<br>
     Rick<br>
