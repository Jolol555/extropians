<p>
Ok, let's make a quick cost-benefit analysis for a SI whether or not <br>
to destroy another budding SI who refuse a negotiated merger.<br>
<p>
Destruction (Kill the tyrrant in the craddle)<br>
<p>
costs:<br>
(1a )Some resources has to be deployed for a brief time while the <br>
rival is destroyed.<br>
<p>
(1b) If the rival has been allowed to reached a fairly advanced <br>
stage, then the operation might incur some damages which will take a <br>
little while to repair.<br>
<p>
(2) We also lose all labor output that the rival could have done and <br>
from which we could have benefitted through trade.<br>
<p>
benefit:<br>
(1) Instead of having to share the universe with our rival, we get it <br>
to our selves. This means we gain 0.5*(resources in the part of the <br>
universe that will ever be colonized). This is a *huge* benefit.<br>
<p>
(2) We eliminate the risk that the rival will one day try to destroy <br>
ourselves. Thus, untill we meet advanced Extraterrestrial <br>
civilizations, we get the benefit of total safety from external <br>
threats.<br>
<p>
Costs (1a) and (1b) are neglible compared to benefit (1). Cost (2) is <br>
also smaller than benefit (1), because we can use the resources we <br>
conquer to produce the same amount of output as our rival would have <br>
had, and this output will now be ours, we won't need to buy it first.<br>
<p>
Even without benefit (2), the benefit side far outweighs the cost <br>
side. The only plausible considerations that could change this would <br>
be either a balance of terror involving total mutual annihilation, or <br>
the inclusion of specific sorts of strong ethical motivations<br>
<p>
