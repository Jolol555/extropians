<i>&gt;  &gt;  Given the lack of </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;  internal and external metrics for human experience and preferences, </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;  most of us know better than to 'second-guess' the transactional choices</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;  people make between themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The point in this case is 'choice', and whether or not children are</i><br>
capable<br>
<i>&gt;  of making certain informed choices. And in this we base an awful lot of</i><br>
our<br>
<i>&gt;  raising of children on our belief that they cannot make certain choices.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  So, we don't leave paint-stripper on baby's little table; we apply a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  blanket "don't talk to strangers rule" rather than trusting the child's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  character judgement; etc. We make informed decisions about the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  choice-making capabilities of our children, for their protection.</i><br>
<p>
Making a child's environment safe by altering the environment is not coercing<br>
the child - there's a difference between covering the live wire and telling<br>
everyone to never go near it (and which one's more effective?).  We can tell<br>
when a child has matured enough to make its own decisions because it starts<br>
making its own decisions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The problem is, of course, that certain children are more capable of</i><br>
taking<br>
<i>&gt;  decisions at an earlier age than other children. However, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  practicalities of the law mean that it must assign one single age to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  meeting of sexual majority. This does not seem unreasonable. If there is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  any argument to be put, it must be that this age is too high (as I believe</i><br>
<i>&gt;  it is, at 18, for homosexuals in the UK). Personally, given the current</i><br>
<i>&gt;  social milieu of the West, I think 16 is about right (and given the state</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of the law it would seem the majority agree with me), but I'd listen to</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;  arguments with interest, especially since a cross-cultural analysis would</i><br>
<i>&gt;  show the age of sexual maturity to differ globally.</i><br>
<p>
The argument I always hear for an age of consent law is "the child may be<br>
physically mature, but is not emotionally mature".  I'm not completely sure<br>
what 'emotionally mature' is, but I know it's a social limit (which<br>
extropians actively challenge (?)).  Physical sexual maturity is about 13.<br>
<p>
If children aren't emotionally mature enough to have sex before the age of<br>
16, then obviously we're not teaching them fast enough.  The thing we need to<br>
do is make sure they're emotionally ready when they're physically ready.  And<br>
that will mean talking about sex in an open, rational and critical manner -<br>
something I'm dissapointed to see many people on this list find hard.<br>
