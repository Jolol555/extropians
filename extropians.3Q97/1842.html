     In my estimation, average municipal water quality, governed by a <br>
     bogged down and likely indifferent bureaucratic system is about as  <br>
     safe as packaged meat...but we'll save that for another topic &lt;G&gt;. <br>

     The municipalities tend to forget about what they can not<br>
     control (chemicals) and concentrate on the one EPA law I *do* agree <br>
     with: 40CFR _Escherichia coli_ elimination and total coliform control <br>
     which is (in general) &lt;1 per 100 mL.  So, I guess that makes water <br>
     safer from a microbiological aspect than ground beef. <br>

     I respond:<br>
     <br>
     Thanks for the informed feedback on the subject.  And yes, the &lt;G&gt; at <br>
     the end of my last statement was to have the effect that I was <br>
     speaking casually for effect.<br>
