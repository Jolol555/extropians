<p>
<p>
Either Velikovsky's work is idiotic or the Scientific method is, there are  <br>
no other possibilities. I have a hunch it's  Velikovsky.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;and then when many of those ideas turned out to be true Sagan         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;adopted them as his own. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That I do not believe. Anybody who wanted to adopted Velikovsky's ideas as <br>
his own is an idiot. Sagan was not an idiot.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Personally I'm no fan of Sagan, given his love of      </i><br>
<i>        &gt;politically-motivated science (e.g. 'Nuclear Winter'). </i><br>
                         <br>
<p>
The nuclear winter theory may or may not be true, but one thing is certain,  <br>
it has  absolutely nothing to do with human political theories, it has to do <br>
with the atmosphere. The atmosphere doesn't give a hoot in hell about <br>
Liberals, Conservatives, Communists, Libertarians , Socialists or even<br>
Extropians. The atmosphere is just interested in Thermodynamics.<br>
              <br>
If Dr. Sagan thought there was one chance in a thousand of being correct it  <br>
was his duty to shout it from the rooftops. If it turns out he was wrong  <br>
there is no disgrace in that, all the great scientists were wrong about <br>
something important in their careers, its part of the Scientific method. <br>
The great advantage Science has over other philosophies is that its self <br>
correcting.<br>
              <br>
Robert Anton Wilson is sounding more and more like a fool to me.  <br>
