Nadia asks:<br>
<i> &gt; In a message dated 97-09-09 19:44:01 EDT, you write:</i><br>
<i> &gt;  &gt; Also for the record, my version is experimentally testable</i><br>
<i> &gt;  &gt; and his isn't, so there.)</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; so....where?</i><br>
<p>
A good place to start might be<br>
<a href="http://www.tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html#interim">http://www.tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html#interim</a><br>
<p>
I was arguing against Eliezer's idea that we have an ethical<br>
obligation to build systems that will discover the Objective Meaning<br>
of Life for us.  Strictly speaking, I was not asserting subjectivity<br>
of meaning against objectivity of meaning, I was just criticizing<br>
Eliezer's particular model of objective meaning.  I particularly<br>
objected to his notion that the Interim Meaning of Life is an AI<br>
project.  I think there is considerably more to the Meaning of Life<br>
than that, and I find the idea that the Meaning of Life could be<br>
encapsulated in a single book, project, or the philosophy of some<br>
Horatio (proud mutant or otherwise) to be, at the very least, a<br>
philistine notion.  Life is a lot bigger than I am, and Life is<br>
a lot bigger than Eliezer is.<br>
<p>
As for my own views, I didn't carry out the debate in public because<br>
I suspect it will take me at least a few more decades to shape up<br>
my own opinions about objectivity vs. subjectivity of meaning.  I<br>
find the idea (which Max More referred to in a recent post) that<br>
information-theoretic entropy is an observer-dependent quantity to<br>
be a very salient idea in relation to these things, but I'm not<br>
sure quite exactly where the salience is yet.<br>
<p>
But when Eliezer says that my version isn't experimentally<br>
testable, I'm not sure what he is referring to as my version.<br>
(I guess indeterminacy is enough to preclude experimental<br>
testability, but Eliezer's claim makes it sound as if there is<br>
more going on here than there is.)<br>
