     Interestingly, the traditional source for charity has been churches.<br>
     Essentially, they offer a deal; accept our meme-set, and we'll feed <br>
     you.  The recipient must choose the deal and go along with it, or at <br>
     least fake it convincingly.  It's my impression that religious charity <br>
     hurts dignity less than government charity, which is generally quite <br>
     unearned.<br>
     <br>
     So there is a way out, albeit one with sometimes nasty consequences, <br>
     as the religions are sometimes quite a problem themselves.<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight adds:<br>
     <br>
     This is a rather generalizing.  Churches certainly use their charity <br>
     as an opportunity to minister but it's not (or at least not supposed <br>
     to be) a requirement to accept their belief system to receive their <br>
     good will.  Christian churches that practice these types of <br>
     ministration are essentially attempting to do what they feel Christ <br>
     would've done and that is serve others and live with grace.  <br>
     <br>
     There is a service in providing someone with a simplistic meme if it <br>
     affords meaning and comfort to their lives and that's all they can <br>
     take on.  It can backfire when they get on their feet and they use <br>
     that meme as the same addictive substance that may have lead them to <br>
     seek charity in the first place.  Trading in your drug of choice for <br>
     Jesus, so to speak.  That's where organized religion doesn't serve <br>
     well, when it, perhaps unwittingly turns the meek into monstrous <br>
     lampoons of its sacred icons.<br>
     <br>
     As far as renegade memes go, pick your poison, state-sanctioned <br>
     welfare or church-provided charity.  Both can debilitate and both have <br>
     the capacity to REhabilitate.  It ends up being up to the individual's <br>
     emotional and intellectual capacity what they latch onto.<br>
