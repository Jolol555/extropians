        Sorry to burst your bubble, Danny, but in the last decade there has<br>
been substantial evidence to prove that the remainder of Atlantis is an<br>
island of Greece called Thera.  What the generally accepted theory amounts<br>
to is that Atlantis was directly above a plate boundary in the<br>
Mediterranean Sea; the island of Atlantis had a volcano in the center of<br>
it.  There was a tectonic disturbance which triggered the eruption of the<br>
volcano, as well as a large tsunami which virtually submerged the island<br>
and the civilization... in effect, there was utter destruction.  The time<br>
of these happenings is estimated to be around 1350 B.C.; there is<br>
apparently an eyewitness account from Egypt in which a scribe detailed a<br>
large "fire upon the water."  We all know that theories such as this are<br>
hard to prove, but from the facts I have read on this situation, it seems<br>
to be the most feasible and supportable... moreso than a pole shift.<br>
<p>
        By the way, what does the topic of Atlantis have to do with<br>
anything extropic?  Chances are, the Atlantean civilization could not have<br>
been very advanced...judging by the lack of evidence of their existance.<br>
As Forrest said, there are numerous other venues that deal with wildly<br>
hypothetical "maybe" science than this mailing list.  Useless talk is the<br>
worst pollutant: not only does it pollute the mind, it corrupts the concept<br>
of knowledge.<br>
