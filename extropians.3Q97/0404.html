<p>
&lt;&lt; My curiousity has gotten the better of me.  What do you use for net access<br>
 while you are on the road in the middle of (relatively) nowhere? <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Two ways:  One is a nifty, neat system called "Park 'n View"...just now<br>
gearing up...has about 40 locations nationwide with 100 scheduled by years<br>
end...it provides cable TV and Telephone access to trucks in the parking lots<br>
of certain truckstops...<br>
<p>
       : Two is rather mundane....AOL has an 800 number...it also has<br>
something called a "Flash Session"...so I just plug  my laptop into a<br>
telephone Jack...(truckstops have LOTS of telephones) and in about a minute<br>
it automatically unploads my Rants and Downloads the erudite scholarly<br>
dissertations everyone else...cost me about a dime.<br>
<p>
You think Little America was in the middle of nowhere?  Right now I'm in<br>
Wells Nevada....Tomorrow it's going to get DESOLATE.<br>
