Natasha More:<br>
<i>&gt;The gay</i><br>
<i>&gt;community has become quite recognized and powerful in many segments of</i><br>
<i>&gt;society.  It is not longer considered a handicap, but a voice of individualism.</i><br>
<p>
I'm sorry, Natasha, but all current evidence runs against your <br>
statement.  The staff of national gay organizations, which I interact with <br>
on a regular basis, would dearly like to take a break and would give <br>
almost anything to have the kind of power and influence you mention.  <br>
Violence and social approbabation, losing one's job and housing are <br>
the daily realities for gay persons all over the globe.  Yes we have <br>
made progress, but it is slow, hard-won, and easily lost.  Even in <br>
the field of the arts, which I assume you may be using as an example, <br>
gay art is often ghettoized, and many remain in the closet to keep <br>
their jobs.  Yes, I see much hope ahead, also a lot of work, but <br>
work that none of us would take on if we didn't see the chance to <br>
make a better life.  <br>
<p>
I am sorry that this does not sound as <br>
optimistic as your above statement, but I would rather develop an <br>
optimism that deals with things as they really are and where we have <br>
the most chance of making a better life.  And this is definitely an <br>
area in which I am finding some conflicts with extropian thinking, <br>
because sometimes I feel torn between the the two, but I suppose that <br>
is something I must work out on my own.<br>
