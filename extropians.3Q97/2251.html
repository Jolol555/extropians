<i>        &gt;A Real object such as the Mandelbrot set's shape cannot be directly        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;represented. </i><br>
<p>
Agreed, at least I can't.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Its abstract definition is easily stated in a few hundred bytes          </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
At the most.              <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;In fact, the Mandelbrot set is a rather simple object in terms of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;complexity theory since its description is  very much smaller than         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;its resulting representation!</i><br>
               <br>
<p>
Pi = 4 - 4/3 +4/5 -4/7 +4/9 - 4/11 + ...  <br>
<p>
Please tell me what the trillionth digit of Pi is. The short line above is <br>
all the information you need to figure it out, so you should be able to do it <br>
in a snap. It's simple.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>       &gt;Ah, serious confusion here. Indeed, to our perception, the Mandelbrot        </i><br>
<i>       &gt;Set is infinitely complex, in its overwhelming amount of detail. In        </i><br>
<i>       &gt;terms of complexity theory, the Mandelbrot Set is a simple object. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
In terms of which complexity theory? You act as if complexity is a clear cut  <br>
obvious idea universally agreed upon. It's not.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The mathematical definition of complexity is basically the length of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the string describing the algorithm used to create the object. </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
Obviously we must talk about the minimum string or it is not unique, but as  <br>
I've already mentioned, it's been proven that we can never know if a smaller <br>
string that does the same thing can be found, so if this is the definition of  <br>
complexity it's not a very useful concept because we can never know waht it<br>
is for anything.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Let me make a slight modification to my terminology:   </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Areal - Abstractly Real, ie, Platonic reality        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Preal - Physically Real, representable in the physical universe       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Mreal - Mentally Real, representable in the mind        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Mreal is a subset of Preal. Preal is a subset of Areal.        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;The set of integers, and the Mandelbrot Set are Areal objects. Said </i><br>
<i>        &gt;sets  cannot be represented in the Preal or Mreal. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Three questions.<br>
<p>
1) Exactly what is this property you call "physical" and how can I test to <br>
   see if an object has it?<br>
<p>
2) If Mreal is a subset of Preal and I have the idea of a fire breathing   <br>
   dragon in my mind, does that mean that dragons are physically real?<br>
<p>
3) If the integers or the Mandelbrot Set are not part of Mreal then how do   <br>
   we know anything about them?<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The definitions or algorithms for these objects are Mreal, and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;therefore Preal. The  definitions are not complex, and the sets         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;themselves are.</i><br>
              <br>
              <br>
The definition is real but the set is not? Can you give an example of <br>
something the definition has but the set does not. <br>
                                                     <br>
