Good point.  Thank you for putting this perspective on things<br>
for me.<br>
<p>

<i> &gt; competing OFAPP agents are questionable (halting problem?), a Power</i><br>

<i> &gt; game-theoretically speaking.</i><br>
<p>
Thank you for the very clear and precise definition.  I know<br>
that I tend to be more skeptical about scalar comparisons<br>
between the computational power of the kinds of Turing machines<br>
that we know how to make and the computational power of the<br>
kinds of Turing machines that we are than you do.  If I<br>
swallowed Moravec's estimates of these things whole, I'd share<br>
your concern.  But I don't know whether or not we know how to<br>
measure the computational power of chordate nervous systems in<br>
a way that we can compare directly to the computational power<br>
of our silicon abacuses.  <br>
<p>
There's research going on to implement sophisticated neural nets<br>
in silicon hardware, and that research route might lead to an<br>
omniscient FAPP entity someday even if we are fundamentally different<br>
from abacuses.  But a review of the taxonomy of neural net<br>
architectures (I usually distinguish between feedforward and<br>
recursive architectures, and make a second distinction depending<br>
on whether the learning algorithm uses feedback from the exterior<br>
environment or not) makes it clear that chordate nervous systems<br>
are both recursive in architecture and (to some extent or another)<br>
seek out and use reinforcing behavior from the environment in the<br>
learning algorithms.  It seems to me that we have very little<br>
technical experience building and training nets that use *all* the<br>
architectural tricks, or in other words, building and training nets<br>
that even remotely resemble ourselves or even other real animals.<br>
While I agree with you in wanting to guard against failures of<br>
imagination, venturing real predictions in a field as new and<br>
inchoate as this one is folly.  I consider Moravec's predictions<br>
to be an enjoyable form of play, but I don't let them keep me up<br>
at night.<br>
<p>
But you may well know more neural-net theory than I do (because<br>
I'm guessing that you may well have more math than I do), so<br>
maybe I'll adjust my paranoia upward a notch or two.  As the<br>
Bears song goes, "fear is never boring."  ;)<br>
