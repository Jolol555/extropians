<p>
<i>&gt; This is the exact opposite of the spirit (I don't have a definition) of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; word "real", at least as I use it.</i><br>
<p>
And thus the confusion. So, let's try a few definitions on here:<br>
<p>
	Real  - anything one says is same....<br>
	PReal - Physically Real. Representable by a one to one mapping<br>
		onto the set of all physical particles in the Universe.<br>
	Mreal - Representable by a functioning brain.<br>
<p>
Now, mentally real is representable by mapping into our brains, probably<br>
limited to about the number of synapses in the brain.<br>
<p>
This yields the usual kind of numbers - 10^13 neurons, 10^4 synapses per<br>
neuron, 10^3 states per synapse, so some 10^20 in all, with 10^20!<br>
combinations of connections (way too many, but no matter here).<br>
<p>
The set of integers can be defined by the Peano axioms in about 200<br>
bytes. Representing the entire set, one integer per particle, is of<br>
course impossible.<br>
So, the concept of integers is easily held in our brains, but the set<br>
itself cannot be held in our brains. Ditto for the Mandelbot Set. So,<br>
<p>
	Concept of Integers  = Preal<br>
	Set of Integers	    != Preal<br>
<p>
I think the notion of "Real" is a dead end, with no real consequences.<br>
Now Preal gives some hope towards knowing the limits of our<br>
understanding, even if we have a Universe Mind (Extropian Jupiter Mind<br>
boundlessly expanded) to do it with.<br>
