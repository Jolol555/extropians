BUt please consider DNA sequencing as an analogy. The first sequences<br>
were<br>
done by incredibly labor-intensive analyses, yielding, after many years<br>
of effort, analyses of strings of 50 or 100 bases. A technician can now<br>
sequence 100 bases in an hour, compare the result to known patterns,<br>
cross-check for similaries, and eat lunch at the same time. Yes it<br>
takes years to build the first tools, but after you have the tools<br>
you can automate them and operate at the next level of complexity.<br>
<p>
As with DNA sequencing and  semiconductor design, the fundamental<br>
tools for nanotech are physical, but after the fundamental tools<br>
are available, subsequent advances in design efficiency depend<br>
primarily on software.<br>
<p>
Drexler, Merkle, et. al. are design the equivalent of transistors<br>
and resistors. After you have enough basic building blocks, your<br>
design can proceed to the next level. Yes, better building blockk<br>
will enable better next-level designs, but the first small set of<br>
building blocks, the set that can be assembled by an assembler<br>
built from that set, will IMO also provide a basis for "Goo".<br>
<p>
The problem with defensive nanotech IMO has never been a lack<br>
of potential capability, but rather stems from the lag time<br>
between the introduction of the goo and the devevelopment of<br>
the defense. the goo can replicate and overwhelm the defense<br>
before the defender has time to design an effective counter for<br>
tbe goo. The existing immune system works because it can learn<br>
to build a new kind of defense from standard parts very quickly.<br>
When it cannot learn fast enough, it fails.<br>
<p>
In the scenarios we are discussing, the first goo will be<br>
designed either by accident or deliberately, by humans at<br>
human design speeds. It will have to be countered by<br>
human design efforts operating at human design speeds. Design<br>
of a flexible nano-immune system capable of adaptation to a<br>
full range of threats is an entirely different level of<br>
design complexity. Thus the problem is that the time from the<br>
beginning of the attack until the deployment of the defense is<br>
long enough that the defender is already dead, or assimilated,<br>
or whatever.<br>
