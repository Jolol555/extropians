has patented a way to hook together "a system of neural networks that<br>
he claims can surpass human powers of creativity".&gt;<br>
<p>
A Web search on Stephen Thayer doesn’t turn up anything other than<br>
references to this and another article besides stuff from Thayer’s<br>
company <br>
(cf. <a href="http://www.imagination-engines.com/cmissue.htm">http://www.imagination-engines.com/cmissue.htm</a>)<br>
<p>
"Surpass[ing] human powers of creativity" at this point seems<br>
doubtful; however, this is definitely the development direction needed<br>
to spur AI beyond the lab, especially the ability to link together<br>
multiple neural nets AND have the different nets cooperate in pursuing<br>
various functions.  The really interesting idea in the Creativity<br>
Machine is described in the MSN article as follows:<br>
<p>
&lt;Thaler claims he can achieve that final step [artificial creativity<br>
and consciousness] by connecting two neural nets using a phenomenon<br>
which he calls the ‘virtual input effect’. While one neural network is<br>
released to daydream, another ‘alert’ partner polices the emerging<br>
stream of ideas for anything that looks practically useful. The second<br>
network acts as a sort of filter in the ‘brainstorming’ process<br>
weeding out good ideas from bad. &gt; <br>
<p>
This also seems to me to be the right approach - creating<br>
communicative ‘layers’ for different tasks.  However, I suspect it<br>
will be necessary to add *at least* a third layer.  This two-layer<br>
approach sounds like traditional client-server architecture compared<br>
to three-tier approaches.  In this regard, Pat Hayes (a recognized AI<br>
‘authority’) had this to say:<br>
<p>
&lt; Minksy and Papert's demolition of the Perceptron depended crucially<br>
on that machines having only two 'levels'. At the time it was generaly<br>
assumed that this wasnt really important, but we now know that it was.<br>
Three levels and you can do all kinds of wonderful things, quite<br>
escaping the M&amp;P critiques. It took a good few years to realise this.&gt;<br>
(<a href="http://www.zynet.co.uk/imprint/online.html">http://www.zynet.co.uk/imprint/online.html</a> in "Hayes Response to<br>
Sutherland")<br>
<p>
MSN also quotes Thayer as saying:<br>
&lt;"Because concept generation results from an internal, high-speed<br>
dialog between two neural networks, totally out of the hands of a<br>
human operator, we form an autonomous, creative agent"&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes, but without other evaluative modules and some grounding in the<br>
real world, it will still require a human artist to sort out the junk<br>
from the insights.  Of course this is not necessarily a bad thing -<br>
the more people who use this tool, the more variation and selection<br>
we’ll get, as opposed to letting the program gyrate in its own<br>
separate reality.<br>
