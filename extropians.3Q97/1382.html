As you know,  you get an interference pattern when you fire a photon (or an <br>
electron) at  2 slits even, even if you send them through one at a time. <br>
It sure seems that something is going through both slits at the same time, <br>
but what? Other interpretations say that it is an abstract pilot wave or<br>
probability wave,  Many Worlds is more concrete, it says it's just what it <br>
seems to be, 2 photons interfering with each other, and this is true even if <br>
you only send one photon. The other interpretations assume that there is only <br>
one reality  (or no reality at all), Many Worlds makes no such assumption.<br>
<p>
Let's do the two-slit experiment, but instead of using film to stop the   <br>
photons after they pass the slit, let them head out into infinite space.  <br>
If Many Worlds is correct then the entire universe splits into 2 when the  <br>
photon  hit's the 2 slits and never recombines. There is nothing special  <br>
about you the observer, you split just like everything else, you know that <br>
the photon went through one and only one slit, but of course you have no way  <br>
of knowing which one.<br>
<p>
Now let's do the more usual two-split experiment and put the film back in.  <br>
The universe splits just as it did before when it  passed the two slits, but  <br>
when the photon hits the film and it no longer exists in either universe then  <br>
the 2 universes fuse back together again. Looking back we find evidence that  <br>
the photon (or electron) went through both slits and this causes an <br>
interference pattern. Again there is nothing special about an observer in  <br>
this, the same thing would happen if nobody looked at the film, or even if  <br>
you used a brick wall instead of film, because the important thing is not <br>
that  the photon makes a record (whatever that is) but simply that it is <br>
destroyed.  Mind  has nothing to do with any of this so I don't need to <br>
explain it, or measurement, or representation, or categories, or<br>
consciousness.<br>
<p>
Does all this violate Ockham's Razor? I'm not sure. Invoking all those  <br>
universes is not exactly simple, but is it the simplest idea that explains  <br>
what's going on? The Many Worlds interpretation is cheap on assumptions but  <br>
expensive on universes.<br>
