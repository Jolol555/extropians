:-) Just be careful - some people react badly when they realize they<br>
have been wrong. Which is itself an interesting area of study in applied<br>
memetics. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; is this not 'merely' a matter of having a large &amp; varied supply, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ability for storage? (How long can you store a kidney?)</i><br>
<p>
As others have pointed out, you just have 36 hours or so to find<br>
a recipient, and I guess even less time if you don't have modern<br>
medical facilities. This is one reason I wish Mike Darwin and his<br>
friends good luck at BioPreservation Inc - even if their methods<br>
don't produce better cryonics, they might very well improve organ<br>
storage. <br>
<p>
Having a varied supply is an interesting possibility, but since<br>
you have to replace it every 36 hours it would be *very* expensive<br>
and quickly produce a huge number of "missing kidney cases" (several<br>
hundred every year for every organ ring). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm still having some difficulty with the free market solution to a problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; like this (the ethics of an abundant amount of artificial replacements are</i><br>
<i>&gt; so much easier).</i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree with you for the most part but something is nagging me about all this.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe it just takes some getting use to ;-)</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it is a somewhat touchy question. I'm still not 100% convinced that<br>
a free market solution is ideal, but so far I have found more problems<br>
on the non-profit side than the market side. Perhaps there is a third<br>
way?<br>
