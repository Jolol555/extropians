Brent Allsop asks:<br>
<i>&gt; 	So anyway, let me ask you a question I've been struggling with</i><br>
<i>&gt; about what the proper behavior should be.  Lets say you have a very</i><br>
<i>&gt; close loved one.  Say it is one of your children or something.  Lets</i><br>
<i>&gt; say he's about 17 years old ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; [cryonics scenario deleted]</i><br>
<p>
I'd view this similarly to other questions about interventions.<br>
Similar issues arise if he is becoming addicted to a harmful drug,<br>
or is depressed and suicidal.<br>
<p>
I would intervene and use coercion if he were my 10 year old child.  If he<br>
were 30 I would probably limit myself to persuasion.  17 is a gray area.<br>
<p>
There is a saying in the legal community, "hard cases make bad law".<br>
I'm not sure exactly what it means, but I have always thought of it<br>
as advice that exploring these gray areas is not a fruitful way to<br>
establish fundamental issues.  You become embroiled in the specifics of<br>
the situation and it obscures the broad principles.<br>
