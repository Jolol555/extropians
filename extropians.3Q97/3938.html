<p>
  I believe we have reached the state of society in which massive<br>
disinformation transfer is far more common than anything resembling<br>
truth.  While truth can be found by the discerning person who knows where<br>
to look, the majority of people recieve their memes through mass media,<br>
which trains all it's practioners on how to subtly and unsubtly pass<br>
information through a great reality filter.  One such indoctrinations<br>
are mindless egalitarianismAll people are fundamentally the same and can<br>
acheive anything they want through hard work. This idea is<br>
schizophrenically coupled with the idea that people's problems aren't<br>
their fault, usually with a pointer towards a genetic predisposition,<br>
unless they are doing something illegal.  Another meme is that concerns<br>
the importance and need for governmental involvement.  Back when I read<br>
newspapers I saw an article about government standards for the age at<br>
which women should be taking mammograms.  Basically, it said that medical<br>
associations vary on when they think detection procedures should begin,<br>
and the government didn't have any specific age specified.  The quote I<br>
recall goes along the lines of, "Woman are afraid, and furious because the<br>
government won't tell them what to do."<br>
     Thereby they both report and perpetuate an attitude of helplessness<br>
in the absence of government guidance, no doubt with patriarchal overtones<br>
that would have delighted Freud without limit.  However, they also widely<br>
propogate the meme that government figures are usually corrupt and self<br>
serving (which generally involves nothing more than reporting what<br>
politicians say about each other), and a vast corporate/government<br>
Big Brother is watching over your shoulder all the time (I believe I saw a<br>
Time magazine not long ago which on the cover had the eye of Big Brother<br>
peaking through a keyhole, with the title "They are Watching You.).<br>
Schizophrenic again.  The majority of people either respond by deaf and<br>
blind Puritan support of authority, or develop a paranoid hatred of<br>
society.  <br>
	There are many other memes that come through the media filter, but<br>
those two sets of opposing ideas shape much of industrialized world,<br>
especially badly in the United States, probably because of its extremely<br>
Protestant heritage clashing with an evolving technocratic culture.<br>
Science especially fairs poorly through mass media, as the media presents<br>
two equally flawed views of the scientific process.  One is that those<br>
with the most titles and official support are telling the truth about<br>
science, e.g., the FDA says that L-Tryptophan can kill people so it<br>
should be banned. It's amazing that the FDA permits openly sell bread<br>
in a supermarket. The paranoid side of the coin is that scientific studies<br>
are only the tools of corporations so they can make money.  An example of<br>
this is the lawsuits against tobacco companies over second hand smoke<br>
injuries, in which the plaintiffs get away with dismissing tobacco company<br>
studies that show that there is no statistically significant health risk<br>
associated with second hand smoke because tobacco companies in the past<br>
lied about tobacco's carcinogen status.  They did, of course, but that<br>
doesn't change the fact that there really isn't any proven health risk<br>
from second hand smoke.  The Public as a whole is left in the murky world<br>
of political science because mass media never takes the trouble to explain<br>
how the scientific method works, or what statistics mean.<br>
  Reality protection is an idea that has been kicking around for a while.<br>
Eric Drexler has long and strenously emphasized the use of freely<br>
available expert discussion on science through hypertext technology.<br>
Of course, there are organizations around the world that perserve the true<br>
word about this and that subject, but someone who doesn't know very much<br>
doesn't have any way of seperating the genuine experts from the political<br>
lackeys.  <br>
  Some have taken a more anarchic approach to the problem of media and<br>
government unreality campaigns.  Bill Burroughs produced a few strange<br>
pamphlets on electronic warfare that discussed ways of starting riots with<br>
tape recorders and other amusing activities, and with new technology<br>
anti-media activety is growing stronger.  Just check out the<br>
Disinformation search engine, that can be reached via Yahoo.  One group of<br>
techno-terrorists I like is Emergency Broadcast Network, which is a group<br>
of reality hackers who started up EBN during the Gulf War when they saw<br>
that the media was projecting a bizarre hyperreality on top of a<br>
relatively banal little war.  They produce multimedia productions <br>
of TV messages and political propoganda over a techno soundtrack, and<br>
build floppy missiles that they shoot into the air.<br>
 <br>
   I can see VR providing a defense from disinformation campaigns, in that<br>
they could be used by a responsible organizatrion to remove the filter<br>
entirely.  In an entirely immersive environment, people could see events<br>
and processes without editing or commentary, see everything there is to<br>
see on the process and thus make their own decisions.  The interactivety<br>
is even more important, as somebody could keep accessing information on a<br>
subject until they were satisfied that they knew what was going on.  This<br>
might prevent disinformation debacles such as the endlessly repeated<br>
Rodney King beating vehicle, which invariably had the initial section cut<br>
in which King charged the officers.  The media wanted everybody to know<br>
that the cops weren't being very nice, which was true, but it is a bit<br>
contemptible to remove any information which might influence people to<br>
think the contrary.  And contemptible is the essence of mass media. I<br>
personally make the decision just not to expose myself to mass media, and<br>
on the rare occasions that I am assaulted, I just laugh at it.  I think<br>
that the only sensible reaction, as getting sketchy and paranoid is<br>
exactly what they, or rather, it wants.<br>
