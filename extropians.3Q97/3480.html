It would be very easy to disprove empirically: if I threw a baseball<br>
at you, and you didn't duck and weren't bruised, I might be willing<br>
to believe that your reality didn't include my baseball; if you and<br>
I set up cameras with timers to record an eclipse, and we get different<br>
photos, then I might believe our moons were different.  But experiments<br>
like this have been performed every day for thousands of years, and I<br>
have yet to see personally or see a credible report of one failing.<br>
<p>
One cannot empirically prove the absence of a phenomenon, like<br>
subjective reality.  But one can easily prove existence, and therefore<br>
disprove non-existence.  Since this has not been done, I am willing<br>
to commit my life to objective reality until it is, because I've seen<br>
that those who do so produce more value and commit less evil than<br>
those who do not.<br>
