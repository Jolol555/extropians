<i>&gt;1.I am thinking about extropy as a *physical* phenomena, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible state of a determined subset of the universe,  still</i><br>
<i>&gt;independent of the existence of life, that would appear "after". So</i><br>
<i>&gt;it would be anterior, existencially speaking, to even the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"intelligence" effect... Nevertheless, are you speaking about</i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligence just when normally considered, as a characteristic of</i><br>
<i>&gt;already structured organisms,  or are you using a more abrangent</i><br>
<i>&gt;definition of intelligence, like, f. ex., gravity, which exists under</i><br>
<i>&gt;certain physical conditions, independently and even before the</i><br>
<i>&gt;existence of life (as we usually conceive..)?</i><br>
<p>
Well, I suppose gravity is necessary for life because without it there<br>
would be no planets, stars etc. I think gravity is very interesting<br>
because we know the least about in comparison to the other forces. More<br>
speculatively, how do we know that we have identified *all* the known<br>
forces that exist in the universe? Maybe extropy is being driven by<br>
forces, or the interaction of forces, that we don't know anything about<br>
yet. The recent discussion of 10+ dimensions adds strength to the argument<br>
that we really don't yet have enough information about the true nature of<br>
physical and non-physical reality to make conclusions about what is<br>
driving extropy. I'm not even sure that we have enough information about<br>
these other dimensions to make good hypotheses about complexity and<br>
extropy.<br>
<p>
 2. For me, there is no counciousness without life ? (Unless<br>
we consider - and prove...- that counciousness is transtemporal...)<br>
<p>
I think that consciousness is dependent on information storage, i.e.<br>
*memory*. Without memory I don't think any localized concentration of<br>
matter and energy, however complex, would be conscious. it also need a way<br>
to differentaiate between itself and its environment. <br>
