     If people could just hear the rational truth instead of all the <br>
     twisted logic propaganda.  Religion is the one that tells them science <br>
     means death, but this is now a lie.  Successfully communicating the <br>
     truth and remove this single "one-up" item and I bet the tables will <br>
     quickly turn for many people.  "Don't give up in despair and accept <br>
     that there must be death and suffering even when there is an all <br>
     powerful God, have faith that, with a bit more power than what man now <br>
     has, death and suffering, as we know know it, can be eliminated!"<br>

     I suppose it has a parallel to the modern Christian Scientists who <br>
     have been known, in certain devout situations, to withhold themselves <br>
     (and their CHILDREN!) from practical and available medical attention <br>
     and instead chose prayer, laying on of hands etc..  Even when I was a <br>
     practicing Christian, this seemed ludicrous (the notion being that I <br>
     should at least be able to empathize with them since they were calling <br>
     upon God for aid).  But I also chose to believe that if a divine <br>
     influence was working in the world, it didn't work exclusively in a <br>
     supernatural/miraculous way.  Being a physician, a specialized one at <br>
     that, is no cakewalk and requires not only intellect but devotion (a <br>
     little generalization in not acknowledging quackery).  That's not <br>
     miraculous!?  With all the dregs that are more ballast for humanity <br>
     than they are contributing elements, it seems very extraordinary.  <br>
     <br>
     If one DOES believe in God, would one deny themselves available <br>
     medical treatment?  Hmmm, this actually gives me a different spin on <br>
     cryonics.  I'll continue pondering the viability.  My stop gap is <br>
     still not that I don't *care* whether I die, I just have this very <br>
     deep conviction, intuitively, that I am more than a biological <br>
     computer.  This seems to be the "given" in embracing cryonics and I'm <br>
     just not there.  Though that may defy logic in the eyes of some, I use <br>
     more than one internal organ to determine my actions (note to the <br>
     left-brained: I'm being metaphorical). <br>
     <br>
     At this point, cryonics is about as viable as mormonism &lt;G&gt;.  Yet the <br>
     level of intellect on this board suggests there must be some further <br>
     studying to be done and there must be compelling evidence that <br>
     cryonics has a good chance of working.  The logic of "even if it's not <br>
     very likely (reanimation), it's better than rotting in a grave" sounds <br>
     suspiciously like "if you don't accept Jesus, you'll burn in hell."  A <br>
     personal trigger for me.  <br>
