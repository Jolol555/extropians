Back at the beginning of August, Sarah Marr asked:<br>
&lt;Has anybody read any well though out, cogently argued and<br>
evidentially supported theories as to why technology, commerce,<br>
exploration, science, etc. developed in the West (and East) whilst the<br>
African sub-continent remained isolated and communites there relied on<br>
gatherer-hunter activities and basic agriculture?&gt;<br>
<p>
Did I miss this?  I remember the thread but not this paragraph.<br>
<p>
One very serious suggestion is the lack of water transport. Before railroads,<br>
the only way to move heavy objects was by water.  Almost all ancient advanced<br>
civilizations were based around year-round navigable rivers and ocean ports.<br>
 The few that weren't (like the Central Asiatics) were generally based around<br>
conquering the rest or trading their luxury good.  In Sub-Saharan Africa,<br>
virtually all the rivers are highly seasonal and unnavigable most of the<br>
year, and there are virtually no harbors.  Most of the better rivers, like<br>
the Congo, serve jungles which are not very good habitat for people. <br>
<p>
Send me a message if you want me to look up the references.<br>
