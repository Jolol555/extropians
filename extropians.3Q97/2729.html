I asked Arthur Clarke his current opinion.  He says:<br>
<p>
`Things are happening so fast I can't keep up with them, but the first<br>
multi-million dollar funds have now been launched in the US and I can't<br>
believe commercialisation can be delayed much longer. But for which process?<br>
That's the trillion dollar question. (BLACKLIGHT - see web - seems to lead.)<br>
I hope this is settled before I address the leaders of ASEAN at their summit<br>
conference in Dec. and tell them that the Oil Age is over...'<br>
=20<br>
He kindly forwarded this report (including the weird open- and close-quote<br>
characters):<br>

                        PRESS RELEASE<br>
<p>
<p>
Official Japanese New Hydrogen Energy=20<br>
(Cold Fusion) Program to End=8B<br>
Missed Opportunities and Botched Management<br>
<p>
Commercial Development and Research Continues in the US, Japan, and=<br>
 Elsewhere<br>
<p>
<p>
Concord, NH: Infinite Energy Magazine has learned that the official Japanese<br>
cold fusion program (the New Hydrogen Energy Program), sponsored by Japan=B9=<br>
s<br>
MITI since 1993 will not receive continued funding beyond the spring of<br>
1998. The New York Times, the Nikkei and Reuters have also reported this<br>
week that MITI intends to close down the New Hydrogen Energy cold fusion<br>
research program.<br>
<p>
Infinite Energy reported on the astonishing weaknesses of the NHE program in<br>
Vol. 2, No. 10, published after the Sixth International Conference on Cold<br>
fusion (ICCF6), which was held in October 1996 in Hokkaido, Japan.<br>
Contributing Editor Jed Rothwell pointed out several major technical<br>
problems with the research in his ICCF6 review and in An Open Letter to<br>
Japan's NHE Lab Directorate, written in Japanese and English, on page 28 of<br>
Issue #10. The letter includes 17 references to the literature, and it lists<br>
concrete problems with the protocols and materials used at the NHE lab,<br>
including low cell temperatures, improper cell and cathode materials,<br>
inadequate preparation and pre-testing of cathodes, and so on. These<br>
technical criticisms did not originate with Infinite Energy. They were<br>
suggested by Drs. Stanley Pons, Martin Fleischmann, John Bockris, Edmund<br>
Storms, T. Mizuno,  Hideo Ikegami and the others cited in the footnotes. We<br>
pointed out that the French Atomic Energy Commission has successfully<br>
replicated the Pons-Fleischmann IMRA boil-off experiments (originally<br>
reported in Physics Letters A, 176 (1993) 118-129), because they were more<br>
careful about replicating every detail of the experiment, without making any<br>
changes.=20<br>
<p>
The NHE is staffed mostly by scientists and engineers new to the cold fusion<br>
field.  They are on  6 to 12 month assignments to the NHE lab. We urged the<br>
NHE researchers to pay more attention to the literature; to hire some<br>
electrochemists for the research; and to try the techniques suggested by<br>
these leading workers, but as far as  we know they have not done so. We did<br>
not receive any official response to the Open Letter, nor did we expect any.<br>
Unofficially, NHE researchers denied that there is anything wrong with their<br>
techniques, and they refused to address any of the technical points in the<br>
Open Letter. They accused us of plotting to bring down the lab in league<br>
with arch-enemies of cold fusion  such as John Huizenga and Frank Close.<br>
<p>
A MITI spokesman, quoted in news reports,  pointed out that the $20 million<br>
spent on cold fusion was =B3was a pittance=B2 compared with what is spent on=<br>
 other<br>
energy programs, like nuclear fast breeder reactors. Unfortunately, Japan=B9=<br>
s<br>
official NHE program could have had a major impact on the world=B9s future=<br>
 in<br>
sustainable energy=8B eliminating not only the need for fossil fuels but<br>
dangerous and problem-plagued programs such as breeder reactors.  Instead<br>
the news about the NHE program, certain to be abused by critics of cold<br>
fusion, will simply muddy the waters.=20<br>
<p>
Let there be no misunderstanding: The prospective NHE closing has nothing to<br>
do with determining whether excess energy and low energy reactions are real<br>
or not. The evidence for excess heat and nuclear reactions at low energy is<br>
overwhelmingly established by numerous published peer-reviewed and non-peer<br>
reviewed papers and reports.<br>
<p>
Excellent experimental continuing work that totally confirms the original<br>
cold fusion claims, and more,  has been done in Japan. We cite, in<br>
particular the work of Drs. Yoshiaki Arata and Yue-Chang Zhang, which was<br>
recently the topic of a 56-page special issue of the High Temperature<br>
Society of Japan.,  =B3Solid State Plasma Fusion (=8CCold Fusion=B9)=B2 Vol.=<br>
 23,<br>
January 1997. This work has also been published in several papers in the<br>
Proceedings of the Japanese Academy of Sciences. Dr. Arata is an esteemed<br>
physicist who had been instrumental in Japan=B9s hot fusion program.<br>
<p>
Among other continuing activity in Japan, Infinite Energy has profiled the<br>
work of Dr. Mizuno on excess energy from solid state (solid proton<br>
conductor) cold fusion devices and established transmutation in metals of<br>
more conventional cold fusion devices. Drs. Ohmori and Enyo have obtained<br>
excellent excess heat results in light water systems. They have also<br>
observed and published evidence of metal transmutation phenomena. These<br>
scientists have been ignored in the official NHE program. In general, the<br>
NHE program has not given serious, appropriate attention to the excess<br>
energy phenomenon in light-water cold fusion cells, which is the preferred<br>
embodiment in many US-based efforts.<br>
<p>
In the United States, commercial activity in cold fusion energy has<br>
accelerated beyond the Japanese work. Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. of<br>
Sarasota Florida (CETI), BlackLight Power, Inc. of Malvern, Pennsylvania,<br>
and ENECO of Salt Lake City=8B to name the more well-known efforts=8B  are<br>
developing commercial heating and electricity generating devices. Several<br>
major utility companies have established investment positions within some of<br>
these companies. The Cincinnati Group in Ohio has recently announced for<br>
sale a commercial demonstration device that transmutes radioactive thorium<br>
into benign nuclides in less than an hour. CETI, whose cold fusion heating<br>
devices have been profiled several times on Good Morning America  and<br>
Nightline,  also has a radioactivity reducing processes for which a United<br>
States Patent has been allowed. A cold fusion New Energy Technhologies<br>
investment fund, directed from Greenwich Venture Partners of Greenwich,<br>
Connecticut has just been launched (see Infinite Energy, Vol.3, Issue=<br>
 #13/14.)<br>
<p>
The New York Times, which influences all other science reporting in the<br>
United States,  has regrettably not been covering progress in cold fusion<br>
research. Its last comprehensive report on cold fusion was on November 17,<br>
1992,  by Andrew Pollack, who is based in Japan. Mr. Pollack has not<br>
attended cold fusion conferences in Japan or anywhere else, but he was quick<br>
this week to report MITI=B9s decision on the NHE program. The Times report=<br>
 was<br>
published on August 26, 1997, in an article titled =B3Japan, Long a Holdout,<br>
Ending Cold Fusion Quest.=B2 He states that the research =B3has failed to<br>
confirm that the phenomenon exists.=B2 This is a gross misunderstanding of=<br>
 the<br>
situation. We also point out that New York Times science reporter, William<br>
Broad, recently shown the work of Drs. Arata and Zhang by a representative<br>
of Dr. Arata, refused to report on it. Broad has previously (1991) written<br>
on accusations by cold fusion critics of alleged (and disproved) ethical<br>
violations by Drs. Pons and Fleischmann. While giving major attention to<br>
announcements of US hot fusion program achievements, Mr. Broad and his<br>
US-based colleagues have not covered cold fusion in the United States or<br>
Japan since his article in 1991.<br>
<p>
The recent Times article by Pollack quotes Hideo Ikegami: =B3We couldn't<br>
achieve what was first claimed in terms of cold fusion. We can't find any<br>
reason to propose more money for the coming year or for the future.=B2 Jed<br>
Rothwell of Infinite Energy  points out that hot fusion scientist Ikegami<br>
himself obtained positive results in his lab, which he transmitted to<br>
Rothwell. But Ikegami never published them, for reasons that remain unclear.<br>
Unless he is being misquoted by the New York Times,  we do not understand<br>
why he is ignoring the many positive experimental results in Japan.<br>
<p>
The Nikkei reported the NHE story on August 24, 1997. It quotes a MITI<br>
spokesman, =B3regrettably, we have not seen the effect in our experiments,=<br>
=B2<br>
but =B3we do not deny that the cold fusion effect exists.=B2<br>
<p>
Infinite Energy Magazine will have a comprehensive report on cold fusion<br>
research in Japan in its next issue, Issue #15, to be published in October<br>
1997.<br>
<p>
------------------------------------<br>
<p>
The suggestion has been made that NHE's closure is a cover for continued<br>
effective military work.  But of course such a suggestion *would* be made,<br>
if only by The Lone Gunman...<br>
