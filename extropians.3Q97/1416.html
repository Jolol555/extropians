     I've been trying to do the exact same thing.  The problems I find are: <br>
     trying to be optimistic and still hold the attention of todays audience <br>
     (who have been made to believe genetic engineering will create monsters and <br>
     AI's will eat their children) and trying to present highly complex, world <br>
     changing technologies in a way the audience would understand.  For <br>
     instance, how do you show nanotechnology or uploading in a movie (without <br>
     resorting to "I can feel something... something strange... entering... <br>
     my... body... something small... almost nanoscopical in size" or "as you <br>
     can see, virtual reality technology has progressed so far that everything <br>
     in here looks _exactly_ like it does in the real world!").<br>
     <br>
     I reply (whimsically):<br>
     <br>
     In the words of Ellie Arroway's dad: "Small steps".  An unfortunately large <br>
     percentage of American culture will still keep movies like "Face Off" <br>
     chugging away making millions when it was an incredible joke of a film.  I <br>
     still believe "Contact", despite its less than stellar box office return <br>
     makes it impact, perhaps on the people that matter.  It doesn't take a <br>
     majority of all people, it takes a majority of the movers/shakers to <br>
     guide/direct/inspire the rest.<br>
     <br>
     You figure out ways to convey the possibilities so that the broadest range <br>
     of people can understand/appreciate/enjoy it.  The goals are to make a <br>
     positive-image film that promotes the notion that such incredible change <br>
     doesn't strip us of our humanity, make us something less, something immoral <br>
     or evil.  Look at all the 50s alien-encounter movies.  All shtick-horror or <br>
     alarmist in nature.  I want to transcend that rather monkey-brained <br>
     tendency that pervades in our culture that our survival hinges on physical <br>
     predisposition and our more recent (last few millennia) traditional notions <br>
     on immortality.<br>
     <br>
     A film about Singularity (the kind we'd like) could happen.  Film is one of <br>
     the most potent mediums of communication available to us.  <br>
     <br>
