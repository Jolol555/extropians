danny asks:<br>
<i> &gt; anyone know how long its been called dogstar?</i><br>
<p>
It seems that the Greeks started calling it that shortly after (or<br>
while) learning about it from the Egyptians and other nearby peoples.<br>
That was going on during the 7th or 6th centuries BCE (600s and<br>
500s BC) give or take a century.  (The Greeks were just<br>
emerging from a major cultural collapse, or "Dark Age", during<br>
the two or three centuries before that time. First they came up<br>
with Homer, and then they got interested in astronomy and<br>
stuff.)<br>
<p>
This probably means that the Egyptians were calling it the Dog Star<br>
before then.  The name derives from the fact that the star is set<br>
in a constellation called the Great Dog.  Many constellation names,<br>
especially animals in the zodiac, seem to go back as far as the<br>
time writing first came into use (around 3000 BCE, give or take a<br>
millenium), so they may have oral histories much much older and<br>
we'll probably never know.  I don't know how old the name "The<br>
Great Dog" is.  The constellations along the zodiac probably had<br>
names long before the constellations in the other parts of the sky.<br>
The Great Dog is not part of the zodiac.  Orion was probably named<br>
first (but after things like Leo and Scorpio and Virgo), and then<br>
Canis Major as an afterthought.<br>
<p>
Sirius, by the way, means "Scorcher" and is thought to refer to<br>
the hot weather of late summer that happens during the time of<br>
year that Sirius rises just before Sol does.  This was called<br>
the heliacal rising, and the Egyptians used to watch for it so<br>
they'd know in advance when the season of Nile flooding was<br>
about to begin.<br>
<p>
Sorry, I love star folklore, so when people ask questions like<br>
danny's, I feel a tape yearning to unspool inside of me.  ;)<br>
(And while "dog" and "Dogon" suggest a pun in English, danny,<br>
no one spoke English in 500 BCE.  I'm assuming you were joking,<br>
but I say this because I don't know if everyone else thinks<br>
that.)<br>
