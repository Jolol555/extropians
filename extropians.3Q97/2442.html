Well, most of my friends and most of the people I've worked with in the<br>
past were, and those are the only ones who really matter. The uncivilized<br>
and irrational are unlikely to be successful outside of politics, military<br>
and police, and I avoid those as much as possible.<br>

When I was growing up the tax-funded education system seemed to be<br>
intended to program people to do what they're told while working<br>
nine-to-five in offices and factories. I've never worked nine-to-five and<br>
there's a fair chance that I'll be able to 'retire' at 35, so that<br>
programming was at best utterly pointless. <br>
