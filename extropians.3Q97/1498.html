<i>&gt;       Ultimately, I'd like to provide a story that could be made into film </i><br>
<i>&gt;       that has the optimistic impact of "Contact" and not promote the scare</i><br>
<i>&gt;       tactics of oldies like "Colossus: The Forbin Project" or newer ones </i><br>
<i>&gt;       like "The Web" or (gag!) "Virtuosity" just because the </i><br>
<i>&gt;       artistically-deprived and generally bored people of our culture will </i><br>
<i>&gt;       lap up anything that has a few moments of dazzle, suspense or </i><br>
<i>&gt;       intrigue, even if the bulk of the offering is laden with predictable </i><br>
<i>&gt;       outcomes, black "plot" holes and generally require wild suspension of</i><br>
<i>&gt;       disbelief merely to enjoy the 1.5 to 2 hours. </i><br>
<p>
I've been trying to do the exact same thing.  The problems I find are: trying<br>
to be optimistic and still hold the attention of todays audience (who have<br>
been made to believe genetic engineering will create mosters and AI's will<br>
eat their children) and trying to present highly complex, world changing<br>
technologies in a way the audience would understand.  For instance, how do<br>
you show nano-technology or uploading in a movie (without resorting to "I can<br>
feel something... something strange... entering... my... body... something<br>
small... almost nanoscopical in size" or "as you can see, virtual reality<br>
technology has progressed so far that everything in here looks _exactly_ like<br>
it does in the real world!").<br>
<p>
--Wax<br>
<p>
Two small steps<br>
<p>
For uploading, visit your local Blockbuster Video and rent the beautifully made <br>
"Ghost In The Shell". You'll find it in the Japanese animation section. It does a<br>
better than average job of discussing problems involving synthetic intelligence<br>
and mind alteration. Quite a bit more intelligent than most SF I have seen. <br>
shows both positive and negative impacts of advanced technology. The film<br>
Includes first person perspective scenes of something very close to an upload. <br>
Does not directly paint a world suffused with nanotechnology - mostly advanced<br>
robotics applied to body/mind augmentation and a willful AI, but this is fleshed<br>
out well. Had to suspend far less to enjoy this film than most of the Hollywood's<br>
dazzle fodder.<br>
<p>
For a much more flawed film, take a look at "Deep Reds". This little B - film<br>
takes a shot at showing the impact of a limited general cell-repair technology on<br>
a group of people. Story is moved along by the machinations of the requisite <br>
bad guy/mad scientist while the source of the technology is provided by an  unseen <br>
alien culture. Despite this, the film does not make the technology into the enemy. <br>
