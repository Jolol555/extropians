<i>&gt; Me:  Yes, that public share you speak of is that small minority who </i><br>

<i>&gt; remaining vast majority have no share in it.</i><br>
<p>
Indeed; as the government increases taxation to funnel our hard-earned<br>
money to its employees and friends, that small minority gets rich and we<br>
get poor.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Me:  Absolutely not.  That's why most families need 2 breadwinners </i><br>
<i>&gt; now..</i><br>
<p>
If I add all my tax payments together, about 50% of my income goes to the<br>
government in one form or another. Were I living with my girlfriend then<br>
her after-tax income would pay about 2/3 of my tax bill or, in other<br>
words, she'd be working the entire year as a government slave simply to<br>
pay taxes. Since government 'services' typically cost more than twice as<br>
much as private services, if we were to eliminate the government<br>
altogether she could quit work. *This* is why families today require two<br>
wage-earners rather than one. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; But what about the </i><br>
<i>&gt; rest of the country who have kids to raise, let alone having even touched </i><br>
<i>&gt; a computer?</i><br>
<p>
Now tell me; what exactly are people doing having children they can't<br>
afford to pay for? Why should I be expected to pay for their kids when<br>
I've chosen to save money by staying childless? <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Most people hate their jobs - they do it because they have to </i><br>
<i>&gt; survive. </i><br>
<p>
Personally I work long hours out of compassion; in a few years I should be <br>
able to cash in my stock options and retire as a multi-millionaire, thereby<br>
freeing up my job and my girlfriend's for the deserving poor.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Again, I'm glad you have the luxury, high IQ and skills to </i><br>
<i>&gt; design your own flex-schedule - most do not have that option.  Where have </i><br>
<i>&gt; you been? </i><br>
<p>
Where were they when I was at school working hard? Slacking off? Joking<br>
with their friends rather than learning skills? Why should I feel sorry<br>
for them? Why should those of us who chose to live our lives in a <br>
responsible manner have to support those who didn't?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Me:  Tell that to the people who have been automated out of a job.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; All I'm asking is for you to tell me what people of average IQ, little </i><br>
<i>&gt; money and little skill are going to do when the majority of the economy has </i><br>
<i>&gt; been automated?</i><br>
<p>
Get off their butts and learn some skills? Work to eliminate the minimum <br>
wage and restrictive employment laws which keep many of them out of work?<br>
<p>
Why is it that the poor in the backward asian countries I've visited are<br>
full of entrepeneurial spirit while those in the West just sit around<br>
waiting for 'Big Mummy' to make things better? Sure, there are people who<br>
are physically unable to ever hold a job, but they're a special case who<br>
can be helped by charities. <br>
<p>
I come from a poor working class family of six kids; I had no benefits<br>
that my contemporaries didn't, except parents who encouraged me to learn<br>
and work hard. Yet I was educated at one of the best universities in the<br>
country, I've travelled all over the world, achieved many of my ambitions,<br>
and should be able to retire at 35. Could there be some connection here;<br>
those who work hard do well and those who slack off don't? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; After all, we can't have 80%+ of the population lying </i><br>
<i>&gt; around watching TV, having sex and smoking pot, can we?  They must all </i><br>
<i>&gt; work, work, work!  'Get to work wage slaves!' - is all I have been hearing </i><br>
<i>&gt; these days.</i><br>
<p>
Uh, you're the one complaining about lack of work... I don't care in the<br>
least about people who choose to waste their lives as long as they don't<br>
expect me to pay for them. How much exactly does rent, a used TV and a big <br>
wad of pot cost these days? How many hours do you have to work as a temp to <br>
pay for that? Couple of days a week? <br>
