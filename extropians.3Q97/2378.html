<i>&gt;   &gt; The point is you shouldn't be happy to absorb wisdom from some black</i><br>

<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  First let me say that I misunderstood your original post, and I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  mostly agree with you, though I'm not sure that you're expressing</i><br>
<i>&gt;  your ideas in the most effective possible way (and there's nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt;  wrong with that, because these are inherently difficult things to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  talk about).</i><br>
<p>
It made perfect sense when I wrote it.  I don't think I can really explain<br>
the meaning of the quoted sentence without inventing a new language.  What we<br>
need is a new language capable of transmitting the model of an idea.  Your<br>
computer can translate it in a way you and only you would understand, with<br>
hyperlinks to the various thoughts and memories leading up to the original<br>
idea.  English is so faulted.<br>
<p>
Alternatively, I could take a creative writing course!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  But since you seem to have developed some method of judging the merit</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of someone's wisdom *prior* to absorbing that wisdom, I'd be *very*</i><br>
<i>&gt;  interested to learn of your methods, since I'm sure I could benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt;  tremendously from the application of these new techniques.</i><br>
<p>
Actually I discriminate according to race, gender, creed, colour, and body<br>
language.  Which kind of makes my above statement loose the little merit it<br>
had!  But I didn't mean individuals discriminating as a basis of choosing who<br>
to give credence to, which I'm all for.  It's the idea of non-critical<br>
discrimination, discrimination without merit that I oppose.<br>
<p>
Maybe critical-discrimination should be a part of the extropian principles!?<br>

<i>&gt;   &gt; It's time we simply stopped programming.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I think we're designed to program. We can hardly help it. But we can</i><br>
<i>&gt;  start doing it deliberately instead of just automatically passing along</i><br>
<i>&gt;  whichever programs happen to have gotten their hooks into our brains</i><br>
<i>&gt;  before we woke up. In Leary's terminology, we can start</i><br>
<i>&gt;  programming and metaprogramming ourselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  And besides, programming is fun! Especially when it's collaborative</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and interactive.  In that form, it's often called "conversation". I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  dig it. It seems to be a positive-sum game.</i><br>
<p>
Again, crossed wires.  When I hear the word 'program' I hear 'dogma'.  I<br>
don't think conversation is programming because it's subjective and<br>
multidirectional.  Programming sounds like hard coding.<br>
<p>
These posts have made me realise something.  This is no longer about skin<br>
colour, gender or sexuality - it's about words.  It's about what meaning we<br>
each take out of words, and our failure to communicate what we really want to<br>
say.  I'm optimistic (dynamically, of course) that we'll find way to share<br>
our thoughts.  And then, even if we don't get along, at least we'll<br>
understand why.<br>
