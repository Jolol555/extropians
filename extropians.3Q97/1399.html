I too am a fan of fuzziness (so useful to the rhetorician, don't you<br>
know), but I have to say that sentences like the following puzzle me a<br>
bit.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  While the physical facts are always </i><br>
<i>&gt;  100% true, our statements about them </i><br>
<i>&gt;  may be true, more or less. Fuzzy logic</i><br>
<i>&gt;  measures the degree of "more or less."</i><br>
<p>
How does the term "true" relate to the world *apart from* our descriptions<br>
of it?  I am under the impression that we apply the honorific "true" <br>
mostly just to those descriptions of the world that we believe to be good<br>
in the way of belief, statements that better yield seeming success in the<br>
attainment of ends and anticipation of experience than others on offer. <br>
As far as the world itself goes, it seems to me simply to exist, and to be<br>
so constituted that the application *to it* of some descriptions rather<br>
than others yields such successes.  But to say of the world that it is<br>
somehow "true" as well seems to me misleading and even a bit theological. <br>
Ick. As far as fuzzy logic nudging our assessments of truth-claims from<br>
bivalence to multivalence goes, however, I'm already completely won over. <br>
As I said, it's just a quibble.  Best, Dale<br>
