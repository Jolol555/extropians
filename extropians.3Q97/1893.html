<i>&gt;Speaking of waistlines...I've finally got mine out there where I can keep an</i><br>
<i>&gt;eye on it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Seriously though...something's gotta be done...</i><br>
<p>
A couple of cheap suggestions (advice is always cheap, no?):<br>
<p>
-- Jump rope.  Good for coordination as well as aerobic fitness, and you<br>
can listen to music while you do it (or watch TV, if your ceiling is<br>
high enough to do it indoors).  There are books that explain techniques<br>
and training regimens, if you want to read them.<br>
<p>
-- Watch aerobics shows -- hokey, but it can work.<br>
<p>
Slightly more expensive suggestions:<br>
<p>
-- Mini-trampoline:  Similar to jumping rope -- not as intense a workout,<br>
but easier on the knees.<br>
<p>
-- Take a martial arts class.<br>
<p>
--Get a punching bag.<br>
<p>
-- Join a gym with a swimming pool.  Plenty of variety, and if there's<br>
a hot tub or sauna like my gym has, there's an extra reason to go.<br>
<p>
And, to counter your (hormone-induced? :-) ) urge to buy a Western Flyer:<br>
I recommend the Schwinn Air-Dyne as a quality piece of exercise equipment.<br>
It's like an exercise bike that you can also use your arms with, and it<br>
works by air resistance (it uses a fan, which means a) it gets harder as<br>
you pedal faster; b) it has the added bonus of fanning you while you ride<br>
it).  I have comparison data showing that it can give quite an intense<br>
workout if you pedal fast, and Consumer Reports rates it highly.  They<br>
can be expensive new, but Will got one for about $35 in a thrift store<br>
(apparently one exercise bike is the same as another to them).<br>
<p>
Don't forget that gaining muscle is as important as aerobics to losing<br>
weight (some say more so), and that raising the fruit/vegie/fiber<br>
content of your diet can help a lot, too.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
