A somewhat late follow-up to an earlier message about the Feynman Grand<br>
Prize for nanotech from the Foresight Institute.<br>

<p>
I don't see Drexler as being committed to the biological or self-assembly<br>
routes to nanotech.  Rather, I think the consensus today is that<br>
the STM/AFM approach is the most productive.  Look at the most recent<br>
issue of the journal Nanotechnology, table of contents at:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.ioppublishing.com/EJ/Info/bin/toc/na0803A/">http://www.ioppublishing.com/EJ/Info/bin/toc/na0803A/</a><br>
<p>
Virtually every article has to do with probe microscopes of various<br>
types.<br>
<p>
I think this is unfortunate.  While these devices offer quick payoffs<br>
and we are learning some interesting things, I don't see how they will<br>
really work as a path to nanotech.  It is going to be so difficult and<br>
so tedious to gradually learn to arrange 5 atoms, then 10, then 100,<br>
500, 1000, etc.  But we won't have anything really useful until we can<br>
arrange millions of atoms.  And even then we'll be lucky to have as many<br>
as the 32 copies required for the prize.<br>
<p>
The biotech route seems to offer more prospects for useful intermediate<br>
results.  That's what you need if industry is going to fund the research<br>
in a big way.  Biochips, and other integrated devices containing a mix<br>
of biological and micromechanical technology, are potentially a very<br>
important technology.  Biological sensors, manipulators, artificial<br>
tissues of various kinds, all have immediate economic payback.  As we<br>
gain more skill in utilizing and modifying cell organelles and creating<br>
artificial variants, the line between biotech and nanotech will gradually<br>
blur.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the beginning, with biotech we should be able to have mass production</i><br>
of the devices, at least in quantities of thousands when we are using<br>
lithographic techniques, up to billions and beyond when we use pure<br>
biological and chemical techniques for construction.  With probe microscopy<br>
techniques, it is hard to see any useful payoff until they manage to build<br>
a full-blown self-replicating assembler, and set it to work making copies<br>
of itself.<br>
<p>
I don't think STM research is wrong or wasted, because they are getting<br>
data about the behavior of atoms in systems which are too large for<br>
pure QM simulations to work.  These data will feed into the next generation<br>
of molecular design tools and make them more accurate.  But I don't see<br>
STM's as a path to nanotech.<br>
