I certainly don't know enough, but I think the beetles were around<br>
long before that. I base this on the fact that there exist related<br>
scarabeoid beetles in quite remote climates (e.g. here in Sweden we<br>
have the tordyvel [don't know its latin name]) and continents (all of<br>
them except antarctica) which suggest that the family has been around<br>
for several millions of years. I just found a reference <br>
<a href="http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/eukaryotes/animals/arthropoda/hexapoda/coleoptera/polyphaga/scarab">http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/eukaryotes/animals/arthropoda/hexapoda/coleoptera/polyphaga/scarab</a><br>
that suggest their mutual ancestor Aphrodiites was around in the<br>
lower jurassic. They seem to have dealt with dinosaur dung just as<br>
well as elephant dung.<br>
<p>
I also think it the beetles form an integral part of the svannah<br>
ecosystem; without them the dung would not fertilize the soil as<br>
quickly and the open grasslands would not be possible (note the neat<br>
loop here: grasslands suit grazers, grazers produce dung, dung helps<br>
the beetles and makes the grass possible; once started it is<br>
self-supporting). <br>
<p>
So, I think the dung beetles have an alibi. <br>
