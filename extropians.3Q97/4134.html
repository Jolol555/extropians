"The Future of Physical Fitness"<br>
<p>
I was interviewed for this months issue of Wired covering the future of<br>
physical fitness.  (See page 76.)<br>
<p>
"Pants feeling a little but snug?  You're not alone.  According to a recent<br>
Harris poll, three out of four Americans above the age of 25 are carrying a<br>
couple extra pounds. Thankfully a battery of scientists, personal trainers,<br>
and engineers are watching your weight even if you're not.  Exercise<br>
manufacturers, taking a cue from the likes of Nintendo, are turning<br>
treadmills into videogames.  And gymwide intranets promise to regiment and<br>
track your workout routines.  "Wired" physical fitness is shaping up."<br>
<p>
Wired displays a timetable with experts' projections on the following:<br>
Fitness-Machine Connectivity; Safe and Effective Muslce-building Pill;<br>
Multiuser Exercise Videogames Catch On; America Gets Into Shape.<br>
<p>
Interviewed were:  "Mike Benjamin, president of Tectrix Fitness Equipment;<br>
Ray Giannelli, vice president of research and development at Cybex, Natasha<br>
Vita More, bodybuilding guru and founder of Transhumanist Art and Extropic<br>
Art movement; Vincent Scalisi, editor of "Muscle &amp; Fitness" magazine."<br>
