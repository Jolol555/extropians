Hi All,<br>
<p>
    After Max's talk at Extro3 I mentioned that I've started an email<br>
list for extropians and others to discuss the philosophy and technology<br>
of mental transformation, which I have been studying extensively over<br>
the last year.  Want better emotions as Max explained in his talk?  Want<br>
better memory &amp; cognition as Andres explained in his talk?  Then let's<br>
research the methods and implement them now!<br>
<p>
    It's now just an alias with occasionaly emails bouncing between the<br>
people now, and will be on a listserv soon.  If you're very eager,<br>
please send a message with<br>
<p>
subscribe lifeimp<br>
<p>
    in the subject and I'll add you. (Tentatively it's called the Life<br>
Improvement list.)<br>
<p>
    Thanks for your interest,<br>
<p>
    -Luke<br>
