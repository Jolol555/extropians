<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If that's too much trouble or less likely to produce the result,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then getting in on Bovine's deal isn't so bad (for those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; haven't or cannot check out the page referred to, Bovine is a</i><br>

<i>&gt; will keep $1,000, give $1,000 to the fellow that actually finds</i><br>

<i>&gt; and the remaining $8,000 to Project Gutenberg).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

It's an idea, but I don't think we'd be successful. Bovine has<br>
already done about 28% of the keyspace and has enough horsepower<br>
signed up to do about .5% a day right now. If you check out the<br>
top 100 email stats you will see they have some really big guns:<br>
the top team yesterday, evangelist@apple.com averaged 272943.56<br>
kkeys/sec! That is 272943560 keys/sec! My P100 can do something<br>
like 140kkeys/sec max... So unless we get _alot_ of computers<br>
signed up here, I think it's better to take our chances with<br>
the Bovine effort.<br>
