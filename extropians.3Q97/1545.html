     John K. Clark wrote (I'm compelled to reprise this as a gesture of how <br>
     compelling it was for me and to make sure it's not missed in the large <br>
     bundle of weekend posts):<br>
     <br>
     Racism exists because most animals probably have a gene(s) that makes <br>
     them feel that their mate should not look very different from the <br>
     average. It's not a totally bad idea because those who look very <br>
     different are often ill, so this improves the odds that their mate is <br>
     healthy and that means more children are produced who also have the <br>
     gene. Like any simple rule of thumb it can sometimes make horrible <br>
     mistakes and become downright ridicules, particularly when you put it <br>
     into a different and much more complex environment like the modern <br>
     world. Such caned programmed responses are best for an animal with a <br>
     brain the size of a squirrel, but Humans are smarter than squirrels <br>
     and can do better, unfortunately they still have that dumb gene.<br>
     <br>
     If you're wondering why so many Extropians have such a low tolerance <br>
     for anything that has the slightest hint of a racist smell, it's <br>
     because racism has never made one thing of value and in fact, with the <br>
     exception of religion, no meme has ever produced more misery in the <br>
     world.<br>
     <br>
     Rick responds:<br>
     <br>
     Very eloquent in your last paragraph and I'm quite intrigued by the <br>
     genetic origin of racism.  It makes immediate sense to me that of <br>
     course, it would trigger some sort of primitive concern in our make up <br>
     that it would be risking the integrity of the tribe/species because of <br>
     the visual information the primitive minds received to make such <br>
     judgments.  If it looks different, it is suspect.  This rings so true <br>
     for me and I'd like to ongoing discuss its ramifications and <br>
     (hopefully) get away from this banter about "gene" and "meme" <br>
     "supremacy".  Paging down through it was making my finger sore. &lt;G&gt;<br>
