Current market prices embody estimates of the rates at which longevity<br>
will improve.  If you disagree with the market, maybe you should put<br>
your money where your mouth is :-).  Robin<br>

     The future course of old-age mortality is of great<br>
     importance to public sector expenditures in countries where<br>
     old-age programs, such as Social Security and Medicare in<br>
     the US, account for large fractions of the public budget.<br>
     This paper argues that the competitive market prices of<br>
     mortality contingent claims, such as annuities and life-<br>
     insurance, contain information which allow one to infer the<br>
     opinion of the market regarding the pace of the continued<br>
     increase in old-age longevity. The paper develops methods to<br>
     identify and estimate the mortality implicit in the market<br>
     prices of such claims by identifying survival functions from<br>
     prices of contracts that differ in their duration. Utilizing<br>
     these methods, we provide estimates using cohort-specific<br>
     prices of US term life insurance contracts in 1990-96 for<br>
     individuals aged 60 in each calendar year. Our main finding<br>
     is that the mortality patterns inferred from these prices<br>
     indicate a continued decline in cohort-specific mortality<br>
     at rates equal to or greater than recent historical trends;<br>
     about a 5 percent reduction in relative terms in the<br>
     mortality hazards per successive cohort.<br>
