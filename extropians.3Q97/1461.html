I seem to recall that certain British generals had their warriors - the<br>
supposed flower of the Empire - repeatedly charge dug-in German troops<br>
armed with machine guns.  Luckily the Empire had more fine young men to<br>
kill than the Zulu Chief.  Didn't stop it `going extinct', of course,<br>
eventually. <br>
