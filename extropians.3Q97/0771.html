Last year I got a chance to hear from the director of Los Alamos Nat'l Lab.<br>
 I asked him if the lab was working on any weapons with a yield substantially<br>
greater than thermonuclear weapons.  His response was, "I cannot comment on<br>
that at this time."  After the seminar, one of our professors asked him,<br>
"Haven't you manufactured some anti-matter?"  The director refused to answer.<br>
<p>
I take it that means that it exists in a national laboratory, but they have<br>
not yet acknowledged its existence.  What is to be done with it is another<br>
matter entirely.<br>
