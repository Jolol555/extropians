<i>&gt; &gt; Holism can work the other way too: an almost correctly put together</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; person as memories, personality, chemical gradients etc relaxed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; towards a consistent state.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems that some outside intervention would be necessary in this case.</i><br>
<p>
No. Self-organization is just that - organization that occurs by itself.<br>
Outside intervention isn't holistic in any sense. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is there any precedent for cellular self-organization? I mean to say, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; the neurons are simply in the wrong place, what would make them move</i><br>
<i>&gt; about spontaneously to their identity-creating positions?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, there are precedent. Neurons do an amazing job of connecting to<br>
the right synapses by following chemical gradients, especially during<br>
development but also afterwards. It is known that synapses can branch<br>
and split, making the new synapses seek out new connections with the<br>
other neuron. How this is regulated is not yet known, but there is<br>
a lot of cellular self-organization going on. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps after</i><br>
<i>&gt; having reconstructed the brain it would then be possible to move neurons</i><br>
<i>&gt; about, trial-and-error, based upon where activity is occurring and where</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is not, but otherwise, it seems against the second law of</i><br>
<i>&gt; thermodynamics. </i><br>
<p>
The second law of thermodynamics does not apply to an open system<br>
such as a living system (if it did, then we could not survive as<br>
ordered systems). <br>
<p>
I would also like to point out that the likely damage from cryonic<br>
repair is not that neurons are displaced (that does not really matter)<br>
but that some synapses might be left out, some might be misconnected<br>
and some might be completely new. This will change the topology and<br>
properties of the network, which can be problematic. But the network is<br>
adaptive, and will quickly remove the obviously bad links. What is<br>
problematic is how changed the resulting network will be compared to the<br>
original network. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What would be the reductionist explaination for identity? Or for that</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter, what are the other ways of explaining it?    </i><br>
<p>
What about Minsky's idea in SoM: identity is the mental model we<br>
make of our slowest-changing parts?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course. But, I am arguing that the higher levels (more complex,</i><br>
<i>&gt; indeed) are still biological. How does one deduce the biological</i><br>
<i>&gt; interactions that produce an abstract identity? </i><br>
<p>
That is an interesting problem. Obviously, the level of one's explanation<br>
should be usable, we do not try to explain everyday physics by quantum<br>
mechanics or for that matter nanoscale chemistry in my body by references<br>
to what I'm doing. My guess is that in time it will be possible in<br>
principle to show how low-level brain processes produces higher-level<br>
processes, and so on all the way up to the highest levels. It might<br>
still be impractical to try to show the exact path from neural activity<br>
to identity, just as it is impractical to deduce how a rope and pulley<br>
can be explained using quantum electrodynamics. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For that matter, what</i><br>
<i>&gt; sorts of abstract properties do you know of that have emerged from</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-abstract low-level systems? And are not these abstract properties</i><br>
<i>&gt; more than the sum of the non-abstract system's parts? </i><br>
<p>
Yes, of course! Nobody denies that. Just look at neural networks, where<br>
complex behaviors emerge from very simple components, or flocking <br>
behaviors of boid simulations, or the patterns in Game of Life. <br>
<p>
What I'm getting at is that the emergence of higher levels doesn't<br>
mean we need to keep lower-levels absolutely identical. Sometimes they<br>
have to - change the rules of Game of Life and the behavior is utterly<br>
different. Sometimes they hardly matter at all - the waves and spots<br>
of activity in calcium-spiking thalamoreticular neurons (which may<br>
be involved in dreaming) could just as well be simulated using the<br>
same reaction-diffusion models used to model seashells or fur textures. <br>
So the big question is if identity is so unstable that it will vanish<br>
if we change the brain a slight bit, or if it is so stable that it<br>
will remain even after large changes. I think it is the later, since<br>
we manage to remain "ourselves" quite well despite constant changes<br>
in our brains and that it is very rare for people to suddenly become<br>
other people just because of neural noise. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Correct me here, if necessary. It would seem you are suggesting that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; pattern exists in the neural network of the brain, which if mapped,</i><br>
<i>&gt; would allow us to fully repair a partially-reconstructed brain,</i><br>
<i>&gt; including the pre-existing identity. I don't know enough neuroscience to</i><br>
<i>&gt; comment, but what if there is no pattern? What if every neuron must be</i><br>
<i>&gt; placed where it was in the original? </i><br>
<p>
In that case identity would be brittle. If a neuron in your brain<br>
dies, you become somebody else. To some extent that is true, but the<br>
everyday change in identity is obviously acceptable to us.<br>
<p>
It should also be noted that the pattern does not exist *in* the<br>
neural network of the brain, it is the network (or rather, the <br>
structure, weights and properties of the network). <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; One consequence of a bottom-up definition of identity is the increased</i><br>
<i>&gt; likelihood that we will have the ability to alter identity as we wish.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Ah, autopotency...) I like the prospects of that, although what happens</i><br>
<i>&gt; when you make a change to your identity that makes you more likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to change your identity in a way that makes you more likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt; change your identity? Hofstadter fans take note.      </i><br>
<p>
There might be identity attractors out there... (one obvious is<br>
of course 100% bliss, you will not want to change identity after<br>
reaching it). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hmmm. Reanimation has a very low margin of error then based upon the</i><br>
<i>&gt; state of biostasis technology today. Pre-freeze cellular deterioration</i><br>
<i>&gt; may make-up even more neuron damage than that, don't you think? In the</i><br>
<i>&gt; absence of a pattern to work from in reconstruction, I don't give</i><br>
<i>&gt; today's cryonics customers much of a chance at being themselves.</i><br>
<p>
Well, judging from Mike Darwin's photos, I would say there is<br>
plenty of pattern to work with. It certainly won't start up by itself<br>
if thawed, but I think there is enough broken cells to give a <br>
sufficiently clever repair device enough information to restore<br>
practically all cells. The synapses (which IMHO are the most<br>
important parts) looked quite fine to me. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Your above point does make good sense in that evolution is likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt; have installed some built-in redundancy within the network to avoid</i><br>
<i>&gt; total incapacitation after brain trauma. What are your thoughts on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons for the stability of neural networks? Is there actually a</i><br>
<i>&gt; reorganization to "carry the load," so-to-speak, like you mentioned</i><br>
<i>&gt; above? Or can mere redundancy explain the bulk of it? </i><br>
<p>
As most people know, the brain can handle damage surprisingly well.<br>
Neural networks are massively redundant, and since information is<br>
stored in the whole network instead of in individual cells, it will<br>
not be very damaged if parts are broken. In the brain, other parts<br>
also do take over damaged functions. I have a friend who managed<br>
to overcome some rather severe cerebral palsy through training and<br>
sheer stubbornness, a magneficient example of how the brain can<br>
rewire itself. <br>
