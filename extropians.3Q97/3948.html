<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We have 'big' governement, it spends a lot of money (almost 50% of GNP), it</i><br>

The prime difference that I see, Arjen, is that Holland is more like one<br>
of our states, while your EC is a loose confederate government. State<br>
politics for most states here is quite open, responsive, accountable,<br>
etc., far more so than the feds are. The federal government's greatest<br>
impact is not so much due to taxation and entitlement promotion as due<br>
to regulation. The cost of regulatory compliance is a great hidden tax<br>
here that soaks up so much time and productivity, and causes stress to<br>
many people who have to deal with it. This would not be so bad if the<br>
benefits were worth it, but our schools and much of our infrastructure<br>
is substandard compared to other industrialized nations. This has<br>
occured in the last 30-40 years as the federal government has grown and<br>
grown to become involved in almost every aspect of our lives, and<br>
continually performs worse and worse at the job.<br>
<p>
State politicians are typically very approachable. I've met several<br>
state governors myself, and know a couple state senators and reps<br>
personally.<br>
<p>
Government police forces here need SWAT teams for one purpose only: to<br>
be the heavy hand enforcing the morality of a minority on the rest of<br>
us, namely with regards to personal drug use and self defense. Its<br>
estimated that over 80% of our law enforcement expenditures are directly<br>
related to our present drug laws, and despite the FBI's own statistical<br>
evidence showing personal gun posession to reduce crime, further gun<br>
restrictions are enacted every day.<br>
