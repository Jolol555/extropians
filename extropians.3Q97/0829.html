     Anders Sandberg commented:<br>
     <br>
     Something that might be used to support (or falsify) McKenna's theory<br>
     is to compare societies where psychotropic drugs have been used with<br>
     societies where they have been rare or not used, and see which have<br>
     had the fastest memetic evolution. As a suggestion, what about<br>
     comparing Greece and Rome (fairly non-psychotropic as far as I know)<br>
     with India (some use, at least) and the indian civilizations?<br>
     According to McKenna the amount of novelty among the Atztecs would<br>
     have been larger than among the Greeks.<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     I am sensing an underlying assumption that Greco-Roman = psychedelics <br>
     = successful empire and Indians/indigenous = psychedelics = where are <br>
     they now?  I don't know that I can automatically exalt ancient empires <br>
     whose influence still dominates our cultural thinking (at times to our <br>
     detriment) over ones that have vanished.  Your conclusion appears to <br>
     be over-simplifying so I'll just ask for more information so that I <br>
     may reaccess.  This thread is getting interesting now...<br>
     <br>
