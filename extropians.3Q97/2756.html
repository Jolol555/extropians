<i>&gt; Despite the many seeming doubts of dear Eric (listed below in his</i><br>
<i>&gt; responses), the universal quality, quantity and integrity of our education</i><br>
<i>&gt; with intellectual self determination and self-actualization appears to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; slowly increasing. As it increases, the ability of each individual to</i><br>
<i>&gt; develop greater cross cultural knowedge, skills and abilities is enhanced.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ultimately, a new, expanded and enhanced paradigm is achieved which will</i><br>
<i>&gt; allow and provide for the individual to understand the complexities of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; society far more than they are currently capable of.</i><br>
<i>&gt; At that point the degree of specialization which I refer to will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; transcended into common understanding thereby providing for greater</i><br>
<i>&gt; participation in our social and cultural structures.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Enjoy!!!</i><br>

One thing that I have noticed about your style of writing is that you<br>
use the passive voice almost exclusively. Such phrases as "is enhanced,"<br>
"is achieved," and "will be transcended," don't really tell me anything<br>
about what the actor in the sentence is. What does the enhancing? Who<br>
achieves the new "paradigm?" What precipitates the transcension?<br>
Politicans are fond of such constructions since it absolves everyone of<br>
responsibility: "The missiles were launched," "The injections of<br>
radioactive material were administered." etc. <br>
<p>
But what irks me most about your writing is how stilted it is. <br>
<p>
Sorry to waste everyone's time,<br>
<p>
