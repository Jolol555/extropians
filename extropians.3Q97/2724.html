<i>&gt;&gt; For the most part, Christians and other "main stream" religions are</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; categorize themselves as witches, pagans, and other similar religions that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; attack not traditional theology issues but scientific thinking its self.</i><br>

And Anders  Sandberg &lt;asa@nada.kth.se&gt; responds:<br>
<i>&gt;Well, not all neopagans are anti-science, I have a friend who is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;practicing pagan priest who is also quite transhumanist and happily</i><br>
<i>&gt;discuss posthuman bodies and neural interfaces with me. But I think</i><br>
<i>&gt;you are right in that anti-science memes flourish in the less</i><br>
<i>&gt;mainstream groups, including non-mainstream christians.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
As another set of data points, Mensa has a Pagan/Occult/Witchcraft<br>
special interest group, and most of the people I know in it are<br>
computer nerds.  Technopagans can be a lot of fun, actually -- the<br>
"To heck with bell, book, and candle -- give me pager, PC, and<br>
(laser) pointer!" crowd.  One friend/member whom I know well designed<br>
some of the graphics processing software for the Mars Pathfinder mission,<br>
and spends much of his free time teaching our six-year-old goddaughter<br>
about various sciences using telescopes, microscopes, bug cages, etc.<br>
(I'm glad he does it -- you couldn't get me to touch a praying mantis<br>
with anything shorter than a broom handle.)<br>
<p>
Be careful of painting groups with a broad brush.  That way lies<br>
prejudice (where have I heard this topic before?).<br>
