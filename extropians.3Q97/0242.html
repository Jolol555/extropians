I think Ian's idea is not to associate with everyone 'as is', but everyone<br>
after they've adopted his own warped world view (a pit full of Ian clones).<br>
 I find his ideas very totalarian, rather than that of an anarchist.  I think<br>
the link to a webpage for 'slackers' on his website says more about him than<br>
any of his e-mails.  He favours a world where there is no rewards for hard<br>
work, so that he can sit on his ass all day why we do the work for him.<br>
