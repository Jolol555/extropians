In a message dated 97-08-02 00:50:14 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Does anyone have more information that they would be willing to share <br>
 about this heralded computer chip that will allow a blind person to <br>
 see light/shadow and shapes?  I saw a few minutes about it on the <br>
 news, but had to take a phone call in the middle of the report and <br>
 missed a lot.  I did not see anything in the papers today, but I <br>
 might have missed it.<br>
 <br>
 Thx,<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I heard that science cured a blind person (he was blind since birth) but when<br>
they cured him he freaked out and couldnt handle it.  It was a total new<br>
dimension to his consciousness, you have to prepare for that spiritually.<br>
