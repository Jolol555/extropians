     Sorry, I'm correcting the thread title...<br>
     <br>
     Yak suggested as an idea for a plot for a transhumanist film with a <br>
     broad appeal:<br>
     <br>
     "A rebellion against all these 'American President saves the world'<br>
     movies.  Instead have a time travelling assassin download himself into<br>
     someone's body with the mission of killing the president because of <br>
     his opposition to anarchy.  This could lead to a great opportunity of <br>
     showing the government through the eyes of someone who's seen better."<br>
     <br>
     Rick responds:<br>
     <br>
     That made a little reworking.  Matter of fact, a serious overhaul.  <br>
     Rebel all you want.  Our current culture craves heros and heroics, <br>
     simple and archetypal as these themes are.  But as far as the plot <br>
     goes, oh yes, by all means, have someone from the future who, because <br>
     of their advanced transhuman intellect, holds the value of human life <br>
     sacred only in what it contributes to the desired outcome for a <br>
     transhuman future.  Brilliant plot device.  America'll eat it up.  &lt;G&gt; <br>
     Not!<br>
     <br>
