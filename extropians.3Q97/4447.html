<i> &gt; By the way, Damien, I think you are right when saying that left</i><br>

Actually, I think it's because almost all of the European<br>
right-anarchists emigrated to America, Australia, and other places,<br>
while the European left-anarchists were too fond of the communities<br>
they were born into to have that option.  ;)  Perhaps the same<br>
thing, but an importantly different way to put it, perhaps.<br>
