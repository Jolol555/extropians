I said.<br>
<i> &gt; Government sharpshooter "was aiming at the other guy" and</i><br>
 missed...hitting<br>
<i> &gt; and killing instead mother with infant in arms. Charged with involuntary</i><br>
<i> &gt; manslaughter.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Citizen attacked from ambush by government agents...returns fire in self</i><br>
<i> &gt; defense ....killing one agent...is charged with first degree murder.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt;  18 year old goat herder killed from ambush by U.S. Marines while tending</i><br>
<i> &gt; goats on family farm...marines not charged with anything.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; And it goes on and on and on and on....I drive a truck...as I may have</i><br>
<i> &gt; mentioned...and I travel the 48 states and parts of Canada...I listen to</i><br>
<i> &gt; radio a lot...during my travels I hear this kinda stuff</i><br>
 repeatedly....only I<br>
<i> &gt; hear about a lot more than makes the national news...like that case in</i><br>
 Ohio<br>
<i> &gt; where the BATF broke in..caused injury to the wife such that she</i><br>
<i> &gt; aborted...then left...sorry...wrong house.  Or the other "Waco" that</i><br>
 occurred<br>
<i> &gt; in Ohio...several dead...no national news coverage.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; What are we gonna do?</i><br>
 <br>
And He said<br>
<p>
 Nothing, of course. <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I find that unacceptable...<br>
<p>
and Wax wrote<br>
<p>
<p>
Go down to the Whitehouse, pin a target to the door, shoot the president and<br>
shout "oops! missed, sorry about that!"<br>
<p>
and that's not so good either...been done before...Kennedy<br>
Asasinnation...just made things worse.<br>
<p>
Sooooo....been giving it some thought...and here's the beta version<br>
<p>
Shunning..<br>
<p>
Anyone who works for or takes money from a government...&lt;local, state,<br>
federal&gt; gets shunned...ignored...held in contempt...made to feel like<br>
low-life....eventually (maybe) people won't want to get these jobs...if<br>
everyone else treats them like something you stepped in.<br>
<p>
Just a thought.<br>
