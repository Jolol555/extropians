<i>&gt;As I said before, it boils down to whether this is a clubhouse or an</i><br>
<i>&gt;outreach list. This may be a hard choice.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Bobby Whalen:<br>
<p>
   Yes, but a choice that should be left to each individual user.  If <br>
you want a clubhouse, nothing is to stop you from creating a filter that <br>
only allows only certain users posts to filter thru.  I believe there is <br>
already someone on this list, who has successfully done this.<br>
<p>
   Myself, I welcome a more *open* forum - here's why. People rant on <br>
rave on this list about using critical thinking skills.  Part of the <br>
price of being open to new and *unexpected* good ideas, is to take the <br>
risk of receiving bad ones.  You have a brain - use it. Use your <br>
critical thinking skills to sort out the good from the bad.  Nothing <br>
irks me more, than someone else ramming there opinion of "correct" <br>
thinking down my throat. Its not only rude and disruptive, but it's <br>
frequency on this list, has given extropianism a bad name among people <br>
who would otherwise be its supporters.  That makes me sad.   <br>
<p>
Please everybody, think for yourselves!<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
<p>
