"Natasha V. More (fka Nancie Clark)" &lt;natasha@extropic-art.com&gt;<br>
mentions:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, television and film:  _Late for Dinner_, both "Picket</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fences" and L.A. Law" episodes dealing with cryonics.</i><br>
 <br>
I would like to add two other examples, first is Sly Stallones film<br>
"Demolition Man" for it's depiction of Cryonics as something very<br>
likely to occur in the near future, as well as technologically<br>
straightforward.<br>
<p>
The second is one I've never seen mentioned in these discussions<br>
before, the "garage-tech" cryonic suspension in an episode of<br>
"Miami-Vice". Briefly, Crockett and Tubs break into an office where<br>
they expect to find a drug lab, and instead find a garage-tech<br>
cryonics lab containing a hollywood class dewar (complete with<br>
viewing window) containing a missing regae star "Romilard Nevin".<br>
<p>
 They are told that Nevin died as the result of fugu poisioning<br>
during his tour in Japan (Nihon) and has been in suspension ever<br>
since. The interesting part comes as they reveal they have<br>
discovered the cure for pufferfish toxin and are preparing to<br>
revive Nevin. When asked if this is possible, the assistant says<br>
"of course" and holds up a large three ring binder, "it's all right<br>
here."<br>
<p>
The rest is really to good to miss, so I won't spoil it.    <br>
<p>
