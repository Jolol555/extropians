When did they make that up? Or are you thinking of DS9? <br>

<p>
But pretty widespread in 40s SF. In any case, most of those claims weren't<br>
made until the early eighties, by which time they'd moved on to 80s<br>
technology and SF. Hal's already elaborated on this anyway.<br>
<p>

<p>
Ah, they've moved on to 90s SF. How do they know they were 'nanoassembled'? <br>
Do they have any evidence whatsoever that they were scientists working <br>
there, that these materials exist and that they saw them? <br>
<p>
Or is this just more hearsay? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Uh, Col. Corso, who just came out with a book, was on the recovery crew,</i><br>
<i>&gt; supposedly,</i><br>
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
<p>
Note, supposedly. AFAIK there's no evidence to back any of this up. More<br>
to the point Corso apparently spent twenty years in military intelligence<br>
and has a long-standing grudge against the CIA. He's hardly someone I'd<br>
trust as a source.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and was with the Joint Cheifs of Staff as well, so the claim</i><br>
<i>&gt; of no first hand accounts is bogus.</i><br>
<p>
By firsthand accounts I was referring to those who could actually prove<br>
they were there; for example the folks who worked on the Air Force base. <br>
Preferably people writing their own books or articles, rather than<br>
reported interviews, and ideally those who said something less than fifty<br>
years after the supposed incident occured. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Marcel, Brazel, and the local funeral</i><br>
<i>&gt; director (who delivered child sized coffins) have all made first hand</i><br>
<i>&gt; accounts.</i><br>
<p>
I'd have to check up more on that. I've already commented on Marcel in<br>
another message (his testimony seems to support the balloon theory),<br>
according to contemporary news reports Brazel said that the 'flying disc'<br>
was about four feet by six inches (three feet in another report) and <br>
appeared to be made of tinfoil, consistent with the balloon theory. I can't <br>
comment on the funeral director, other than to point out that an Air Force <br>
capable of keeping such a story secret for a third of a century would have <br>
been smart enough to build their own coffins. Amazing how they can be so <br>
smart one moment and so stupid the next, is it not? <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Also, the Mogul balloon theory would fit thescattered materials found at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Brazel ranch, if the materials technology problem was not there.</i><br>
<p>
Which materials technology problem? The first-hand accounts don't seem to<br>
show any problem, and the material in the photographs, which Marcel said<br>
*was the material he found at the ranch*, appears to be the material used<br>
to make Mogul radar reflectors. It was also, AFAIR, quite creased and<br>
wrinkled, contradicting the supposed 'indestructible' accounts. <br>
<p>
And again, why did supposedly 'indestructible' material break up into<br>
little pieces when the 'disc' crashed? We have a major contradiction here. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Additionally, vets who worked on that project said that balloon</i><br>
<i>&gt; materials were not classified, as they were pretty basic stuff, only the</i><br>
<i>&gt; purpose of the project was classfied. If this was so, why were the</i><br>
<i>&gt; materials shipped on a priority flight to Wright-Patt under guard?</i><br>
<p>
Because, as far as I can see from the report, they didn't know it was a<br>
Mogul balloon until it was examined at Wright-Patterson, and even if they<br>
did they wouldn't want to leave it lying around for reporters to examine<br>
because they wanted to keep the program secret. Why pass classified<br>
information on to the folks at Roswell rather than ship the balloon out<br>
for examination as quickly as possible. <br>
<p>
(And what does he mean by 'balloon materials'? The payload was the <br>
important evidence, not the balloon itself, which AFAIK was just a <br>
standard weather balloon).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, the Mogul theory does not fit the first hand reports of intact,</i><br>
<i>&gt; damaged wreckage being recovered at another site closer to Roswell, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; recovery of which by military personnell was witnessed by a number of</i><br>
<i>&gt; people on a geological or archaeological expedition, several of whom</i><br>
<i>&gt; have given first hand accounts.</i><br>
<p>
But not until more than a third of a century later, *after* the Roswell<br>
Industry got into full swing and they could make a buck out of it. Odd<br>
that. There are no contemporary reports of wreckage or alien bodies. Not<br>
one. AFAIR there aren't even any first-hand accounts in the 1980 book. <br>
