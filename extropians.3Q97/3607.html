People, as a rule, tend to disagree about ethics.  Ancient Greeks were<br>
contemplating exactly the same ethical problems as we face today.<br>
Philosophy has been struggling with proposed principles for ethical<br>
government for thousands of years.  Yet we still don't agree on even the<br>
most basic ethical questions.<br>
<p>
So, instead, I offer this philosophical argument for discussion, based on<br>
John Stuart Mill's _Utilitarianism_.  I use his definition of "utility."<br>
<p>
1)  Any political system which maximizes utility is an ethical political<br>
system.<br>
<p>
2)  Libertarianism maximizes utility.<br>
<p>
3)  Therefore, libertarianism is an ethical political system.<br>
<p>
Now, I think most would agree simply by looking that my argument that it at<br>
least VALID; my conclusion follows directly from its premises.  Anyone who<br>
would argue that my argument is false must take issue with my premises.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, I do not consider myself qualified to defend these claims<br>
sufficiently.  Instead, I will allow the great thinkers to defend their own<br>
claims.<br>
<p>
First, is utilitarianism really an ethical political philosophy?.  John<br>
Stuart Mill's _Utilitarianism_ is arguably the most important text in<br>
defense of utility.  Any attacks on utilitarianism itself must be directed<br>
at HIS arguments.  Mine would barely pale in comparison.<br>

<p>
But even if we grant that utilitarianism is an ethical political<br>
philosophy, does libertarianism actually maximize utility?  Again, I am not<br>
the man to argue this point.  Who is?  John Stuart Mill is, in _On<br>
Liberty_.  <a href="ftp://wiretap.area.com/Library/Classic/liberty.jsm">ftp://wiretap.area.com/Library/Classic/liberty.jsm</a><br>
Adam Smith is seminal in this discussion of capitalism and well-being, in<br>
his _Wealth of Nations_.  <br>

David Friedman provides a fascinating argument in his book, _The Machinery<br>
of Freedom_, which argues that utilitarianism and libertarianism tend to<br>
overlap.  This book is not available for free redistribution; however, a<br>
few of the relevant chapters of his book are available on-line.  Read<br>
chapters 41-43.<br>

<p>
This list is nowhere near complete...  However, it does cover some of the<br>
significant authors relevant to my argument.  Off the top of my head I can<br>
already think of two or three relevant authors...  I chose these because<br>
they are well-known and because I knew I could find them on-line.<br>
<p>
Read them, if you haven't already.  And if you STILL want to argue moral<br>
philosophy, then please provide a point by point demonstration as to why<br>
these political philosophers are wrong.<br>
<p>
Until then...<br>
