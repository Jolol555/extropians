Well, the message you're replying to sat on my laptop for a day or two<br>
before I logged on to send it; I was replying to his original scenario of<br>
a 'super-UN' controlling the entire world and ensuring that no-one was up<br>
to anything naughty so that we'd be 'safe'. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Everyone lives in VR, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;nobody is allowed out into the physical world.</i><br>
<p>
But that's still not safe. Any alien nanotech guru can come along and<br>
trash the planet; hell, any passing alien joy-rider can smash up the VR<br>
with a rock. So if the VR collective really wants to be safe it has to<br>
send out probes to eliminate or absorb any other life it finds; it has to<br>
control everything, or it's not safe. This is what I meant by the 'Borg';<br>
the 'super-UN' or VR collective is an entity which must control the<br>
entire universe to ensure its survival.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So life would indeed have</i><br>
<i>&gt;some limitations. But this is far from a Borg collective.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not so sure. Certainly it wouldn't appear internally as a single<br>
organism, but the uploads are still forced to run other people's<br>
programming (i.e. agree to limit themselves in the name of safety) and<br>
eliminate anyone who refuses to upload. Eventually the VR mechanism will<br>
cover the entire universe (and is a single computer running a trillion<br>
uploads one entity or a trillion?).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In fact we have often supposed that people would voluntarily move into</i><br>
<i>&gt;VR once it developed to the point where it was advantageous.</i><br>
<p>
That's true, but I don't remember anyone else suggesting that we should<br>
deliberately cut ourselves off from the outside world. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Actually, Nicholas' scenario could be adjusted to allow people to "go</i><br>
<i>&gt;native" and live out in the real world, as long as they were restricted</i><br>
<i>&gt;from access to technology which could threaten the computers running the</i><br>
<i>&gt;VR where everybody lives.</i><br>
<p>
But how would the folks in the VR do that? In order to prevent the<br>
natives from building anything which could threaten the VR, they would<br>
have to have more robots to monitor the natives and control them. But<br>
then who's going to prevent a maniac inside the VR from stealing one of<br>
those robots and threatening the VR with it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A few die-hard realists living on a south seas</i><br>
<i>&gt;island (who insist on walking on *real sand*, not the VR stuff that just</i><br>
<i>&gt;*seems* real) wouldn't bother anyone.</i><br>
<p>
But such a situation would be unsafe, and if we're so concerned about<br>
safety that we'd cut ourselves off from contact with the external<br>
reality, then we'd never allow that. <br>
