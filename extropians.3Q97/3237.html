: And I didn't vote for ANY winners in recent years...although I did vote...<br>
: yet as the non investigations into acknowledged voter fraud in Louisana<br>
: and California proves...the system is broken...it's all corrupt.<br>
<p>
I did vote for one winner in the last decade, but that was in a runoff.<br>
<p>
The recent stadium vote here in San Francisco is, according to a<br>
headline a couple of weeks ago, being investigated by county, state<br>
and federal offices.  Whee.  I can hardly wait to see whether the<br>
mayor (or a scapegoat) will get a token spanking.<br>
