<i>&gt; a belief that</i><br>
<i>&gt;high population densities were synonomous with slums and overcrowding</i><br>
<i>&gt;was belied by the collapse of tracts of low-income houses while many</i><br>
<i>&gt;well-off people (the "people with choice', as she reiterates over and</i><br>
<i>&gt;over) choose to live in crowded and dynamic neighborhoods such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;Greenwich Village or much of San Francisco; etc.  </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The strength of cities is in diversity of uses, as closely intertwined</i><br>
<i>&gt;as possible, which attract and draw along the streets strangers who</i><br>
<i>&gt;visit the various shops and keep, by virtue of numbers, the streets and</i><br>
<i>&gt;parks safe.  </i><br>
<p>
Of course one must remember that many of the well-off choose to live in the<br>
suburbs.  My cynical take on this is that such people primarily do so in<br>
order to restrict their children's ability to learn of alternate ways of life<br>
and thought.  For someone without a car, the modern homogenous suburbs<br>
borders on being a prison, although a pleasant one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now I've begun _Cities and the Wealth of Nations_ (1982), wherein she</i><br>
<i>&gt;boldly challenges every macro-economisc theory I've heard of.  Here her</i><br>
<i>&gt;damning evidence is the existence of stagflation (high inflation and</i><br>
<i>&gt;unemployment, common in the 1970s), the possibility of which was denied</i><br>
<i>&gt;by each and every theory, whether demand-side, supply-side, monetarist,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Keynesian, Marxist, etc.  </i><br>
<p>
I haven't read that book of hers, but either she's wrong or you misunderstood<br>
her.  Monetarist theory predicts stagflation as a typical result of sustained<br>
inflation.  So did supply-side, but supply-side as we know it today was<br>
cooked up after the stagflation of the '70s, so it doesn't really count as a<br>
prediction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;She posits the city as the basic unit of economic expansion,</i><br>
<i>&gt;especially through the route of import-replacement, namely the</i><br>
<i>&gt;development of local industries to make what had formerly been imported</i><br>
<i>&gt;from other cities.  I haven't read any further in the book yet, but it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;been very exciting so far.  I hope I've conveyed a bit of that.</i><br>
<p>
An interesting supporting point to her claim - I don't know if she makes it<br>
in that book - is that many countries are almost just one giant city-state<br>
and its hinterland.  Examples: London/England, Paris/France,<br>
Berlin/Prepartition Germany, Tokyo/Japan, Moscow/Soviet Union, Madrid/Spain,<br>
Lisbon/Portugal, Athens/Greece, Mexico City/Mexico, Buenos Aires/Argentina,<br>
Sydney/Australia.  The city-state is typically 1/6 or so of the population,<br>
more of the economy, and overwhelmingly dominant cultually.  Even the US has<br>
been such, with New York City playing the role from about the Irish Potato<br>
Famine to WWII.  Naturally not all countries are like this, but it's<br>
surprisingly common.<br>
