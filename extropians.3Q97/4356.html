The bobble is a speculative technology that originated in Vernor Vinge's<br>
science fiction. It allows spherical volumes to be enclosed in complete<br>
stasis for controllable periods of time. It was used in _The Peace War_ as<br>
a weapon, and in _Marooned in Realtime_ as a way for humans to tunnel<br>
through the Singularity unchanged.<br>
<p>
As far as I know, the bobble is physically impossible. However it may be<br>
possible to simulate its effects with other technologies. Here I am<br>
especially interested in the possibility of tunneling through the<br>
Singularity.<br>
<p>
Why would anyone want to do that, you ask? Some people may have long term<br>
goals that might be disrupted by the Singularity, for example maintaining<br>
Danny Hillis's clock or keeping a record of humanity.  Others may want to<br>
do it if the Singularity is approaching in an unacceptable manner and they<br>
are powerless to stop or alter it. For example an anarchist may want to<br>
escape a Singularity that is dominated by a single consciousness. A<br>
pacifist may want to escape a Singularity that is highly adversarial.<br>
Perhaps just the possibility of tunneling through the Singularity can ease<br>
people's fears about advanced technology in general. <br>
<p>
Singularity tunneling seems to require a technology that can defend its<br>
comparatively powerless users against extremely, perhaps even<br>
unimaginably, powerful adversaries. The bobble of course is one such<br>
technology, but it is not practical. The only realistic technology that I<br>
am aware of that is even close to meeting this requirement is<br>
cryptography. In particular, given some complexity theoretic assumptions<br>
it is possible to achieve exponential security in certain restricted<br>
security models. Unfortunately these security models are not suitable for<br>
my purpose. While adversaries are allowed to have computational power that<br>
is exponential in the amount of computational power of the users, they can<br>
only interact with the users in very restricted ways, such as reading or<br>
modifying the messages they send to each other. It is unclear how to use<br>
cryptography to protect the users themselves instead of just their<br>
messages. Perhaps some sort of encrypted computation can hide their<br>
thought processes and internal states from passive monitors. But how does<br>
one protect against active physical attacks?<br>
<p>
The reason I bring up cryptography, however, is to show that it IS<br>
possible to defend against adversaries with enormous resources at<br>
comparatively little cost, at least in certain situations. The Singularity<br>
tunneling problem should not be dismissed out of hand as being unsolvable,<br>
but rather deserves to be studied seriously. There is a very realistic<br>
chance that the Singularity may turn out to be undesirable to many of us.<br>
Perhaps it will be unstable and destroy all closely-coupled intelligence.<br>
Or maybe the only entity that emerges from it will have the "personality"<br>
of the Blight. It is important to be able to try again if the first<br>
Singularity turns out badly.<br>
