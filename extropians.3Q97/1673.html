Hagbard Celine &lt;hagbard@ix.netcom.com&gt; asked:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What changes in your personal lifestyle have you taken to increase</i><br>
<i>&gt; the amount of extropy therein (changes = mental, physical, social,</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc.)?</i><br>
<p>
	I'm loving the responses to this question.  I hope what I say<br>
here isn't to far off of what was being asked for.<br>
<p>
	I was raised in the "LDS" (The Mormons) church.  One of their<br>
cultural natures is to work very hard to "save" others because of "the<br>
worth of souls".  "bring, save it be one soul into me, how great shall<br>
be your joy with him in the kingdom..."<br>
<p>
	Mormons believe they have the keys to eternal exalted life.<br>
If you choose their way you will get it, if not it is choosing death.<br>
They believe all are free to choose one or the other and they<br>
continually try to convince others to choose their way.  The Book of<br>
Mormon, 2 Nephi 2:27 says:<br>
<p>
   "they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great<br>
   Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to<br>
   the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men<br>
   might be miserable like unto himself."<br>
<p>
	These philosophies have spilled over into my extropian way of<br>
life.  In other words, I think that they have things kind of right but<br>
just backwards.  If one only follows their teachings, doesn't choose<br>
to do more than have faith and pray and go to the temple... if one<br>
doesn't do the research work required and if one isn't cryonically<br>
preserved..., it is choosing death.  Since I'd hate to have my friends<br>
and family miss the opportunity to make it to eternal life, I take any<br>
advantage I can (without being to much of an obnoxious pain), to say<br>
things like: "In a thousand years we'll know who is right, who made<br>
the right choice, who is alive in a glorious, eternal life, heaven and<br>
who is miserable in hell, sheo, or the grave."  I try to get as many<br>
as possible to not give into the temptings of those that apparently<br>
"seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto [themselves]".<br>
<p>
	In other words I'm more or less crying warnings of hellfire<br>
and damnation to them for making incorrect choices.  I know this is<br>
against the usual extropian nature to live, choose, and let others<br>
live and choose what they may.  But, possibly because of my LDS<br>
background, I have troubles with this.  I don't want to be the only<br>
one of my LDS family and friends that can be "brought back".  I think<br>
if more extropians took this attitude about getting the critical words<br>
of warning out cryonics and extropianism would spread much faster.<br>
(Not to mention the corresponding research effort and funding... ever<br>
hear about the quantities of LDS owned assets and the amount of works<br>
and money that goes into the growing number of temples...?)  Many<br>
people just aren't yet blessed with enough smarts and must be told<br>
what to do with powerful and explicit warnings of how extreme the<br>
consequences are.  It's sad, believing that their promises of<br>
salvation are false, to see so many belief systems like LDS be so<br>
successful at preying on such people that so desperately want to be<br>
told what to do.<br>
