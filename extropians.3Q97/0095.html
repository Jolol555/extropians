Sturgeon's Law applies to the population of "scientists" just as<br>
it does to everything else.<br>
<p>
Modern scientific institutions are curious beasts. Personally, I<br>
think modern science has been dreadfully weakened by the heavy<br>
government funding it has received in most nations this century.<br>
Nothing like modern levels of tax funding for scientific research<br>
can be found in earlier centuries, AFAIK. So most current scientific<br>
institutions (especially those of the scientific "Establishment")<br>
cannot be defended by appeals to the history of science, but only<br>
by appeals to the history of science in this century (which is<br>
still damn impressive).<br>
<p>
If I had to give a cite supporting this opinion, I'd cite Freeman<br>
Dyson's many essays contrasting bloated, politically-motivated,<br>
and relatively sterile scientific projects with small, cheap,<br>
experimental, apolitical, and relatively fertile scientific projects.<br>
There are a few such essays in the collection FROM GAIA TO EROS,<br>
and I think there are some in INFINITE IN ALL DIRECTIONS as well.<br>
But I don't know of any real studies that have been done... it's<br>
a very difficult area to study, at the intersection of scientific<br>
epistemology, political economy, and even pedagogical theory.<br>
