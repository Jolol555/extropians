<i>&gt; You could also kidnap poor folks, check their health and bloodgroup</i><br>

<i>&gt; customer, you select the closest match from your collection and harvest</i><br>
<i>&gt; the organ(s) of choice. Ideally you could time it so that as many organs</i><br>
<i>&gt; as possible can be sold from one person (for example the liver, kidneys</i><br>
<i>&gt; and heart), although this is unlikely. The rest could be used for other</i><br>
<i>&gt; purposes, like dog food. If your clients are rich and desperate enough,</i><br>
<i>&gt; this *might* be a profitable business ;))</i><br>
<p>
The "Hansel &amp; Gretchen" method? ;-) Of course, this assumes that there<br>
are enough desperate clients needing organs to pay for this very<br>
expensive and dangerous form of criminality (kidnapping, health checks,<br>
keeping the victims hidden and healthy etc sounds like quite expensive<br>
and hard things to do; it is very easy to mess things up, and then<br>
the whole operation will come tumbling down). While organ theft is<br>
in principle possible, it doesn't appear to be *practical*. The only<br>
exception might be the Chinese use of executed prisoners as donors<br>
(although this may be more a matter of perspective and personal ethics; <br>
a pro-capital punishment statist could argue that it is reasonable).<br>
