<i>&gt; &gt;gives me a very uncomfortable feeling.  "Sorry, we've decided it's cheaper</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;just to pay out your life insurance than to cure you.  Have a nice death."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I find it hard to understand why people would be more afraid of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; when the life insurance is $100,000 than they are with the current life</i><br>
<i>&gt; insurance level of $0.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Most people seem to have some awareness that HMOs are currently making</i><br>
<i>&gt; this kind of tradeoff.</i><br>
<p>
No, I don't think this kind of tradeoff occurs now with an HMO.  If the<br>
HMO was strictly working on the basis of spending the least money, it<br>
would refuse to authorize any medical treatments to anyone.  This way it<br>
would have zero expenses and make lots of money from the insurance premiums.<br>
<p>
Of course, it can't do this, first because it wouldn't have any customers,<br>
second because it would be a breach of contract, and third because it<br>
would probably be illegal in the regulated medical industry.  Instead,<br>
the HMO promises to fund all treatments which are accepted by the medical<br>
profession as justified in terms of extending the life and improving<br>
the health of the patient.  When it refuses to authorize a procedure,<br>
it is with the excuse that it is experimental or that it will not help.<br>
It never says that the treatment costs more than the patient's life is<br>
worth.  If it does refuse medicine which is valid by the stated rules,<br>
the patient can use various appeal and arbitration procedures to contest<br>
the refusal.<br>
<p>
So the current situation with an HMO is very different than it would<br>
be under Robin's proposal.  Under that plan in its purest form, the<br>
HMO might very well refuse a helpful medical procedure, if the expense<br>
would be greater than the life insurance payment.  The contractual basis<br>
between the HMO and patient is very different.  A refusal on the basis<br>
of expense would be completely justified by the HMO.  In fact, if the<br>
HMO got into cash flow difficulties, it might even refuse procedures<br>
which would be cost effective, as long as the death of the patient due<br>
to lack of treatment would not occur too soon (borrowing from tomorrow<br>
to pay for today).  None of this would be contestable by the patient,<br>
because the contract would allow the HMO to do whatever it wanted with<br>
the money, relying on the life insurance payment to give it incentives<br>
to extend its patients' lives.<br>
<p>
I'm not saying this plan is necessarily a bad idea, merely that the<br>
incentives and the nature of the patient-HMO relationship would be very<br>
different than under the current system.<br>
