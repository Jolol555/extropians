There is a higher order, which we understand fairly well but not<br>
completely.  There are, for example, gaps in the asteroid belt, produced by<br>
the gravity of Jupiter and Saturn.  Chaos theory is highly applicable; we<br>
have only come to understand some of the behavior of the solar system in<br>
recent years, now that we have chaos theory so we can predict stuff.<br>
<p>
In the long run, the asteroid belt is not stable.  It is slowly grinding<br>
itself down to dust in a series of high-speed collisions, and the dust<br>
spirals into the Sun because of light pressure.  We're losing about half<br>
the belt every two billion years.<br>
