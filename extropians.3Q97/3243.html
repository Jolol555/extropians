I've never understood why people think this.  (I believe Hagbard Celine is<br>
correct to label it a myth.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the EMT or paramedic's perspective, if a person is an organ donor, it</i><br>
means you *continue* to give CPR, even when the person seems unsalvageable.<br>
 But there are very few cases in which EMT's are allowed to withhold this<br>
care, anyway (decapitation, rigor, total-body-cruch, etc.), so they would<br>
do that either way if there was no obvious reason not to.  As for ER<br>
doctors, their strongest motivation, for a variety of reasons, is to save<br>
every person who can be saved.  Unless there is some conspiracy (where the<br>
doctor is being bribed by someone), there is much more value to the doctor<br>
in adding one saved ER life to his tally than there is in adding one ER<br>
death and one successfully donated organ.  MUCH more value.<br>
