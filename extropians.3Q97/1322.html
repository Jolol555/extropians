I recently used a coinage of my own  here - `black holism'.  Anders<br>
subsequently noted that neologisms are the devil's mark of crackpots, so<br>
perhaps I should try to spell out this phrase a little more.  :)<br>
<p>
<p>
Here's a quote from something in the works:<br>
<p>
Careless scuba divers are prey to a disorienting buzz: nitrogen narcosis.<br>
This addlement was known once by a beautiful, alarming name: `raptures of<br>
the deep'.  The compressed air-mixture breathed by divers, you see,<br>
contains inert nitrogen, which gets forced into their brain tissues by the<br>
pressure of the watery depths, causing silliness, unmotivated giggles or,<br>
even more dangerously, fits of gloom and panic.<br>
	=09<br>
For most of us, untrained in the sciences, advanced physics is no less<br>
alien a realm than the deep ocean.  Venture beyond the safe shores of the<br>
high-school lab and your common-sense is put at risk.  Like victims of<br>
nitrogen narcosis, you may find yourself slipping into irrational elation<br>
or despair.  Call it, especially in its New Age or astrobabble forms,<br>
`raptures of the shallow'.<br>
	=09<br>
This is unhappy news if, like me, you take cautious pleasure in today's<br>
cornucopia of scientific discovery.  Science, after all, is the motor of<br>
our age, and a large part of its secret ideology.  While it is dismal that<br>
so many of us are frightened, or dismissive, or simply ignorant of this<br>
ornate and fecund landscape, even worse is its gleeful colonisation by<br>
slipshod thinkers for whom equations are mantras.  Those who find their<br>
latest shallow rush browsing the New Age `holism' shelves especially adore<br>
books about cosmology and quantum theory - the majestically great, the<br>
enigmatic small.<br>
	=09<br>
For decades a key icon of shivery mystery was the black hole, that<br>
mysterioso realm found deep in interstellar space where the laws of physics<br>
get their comeuppance.  Hijacked kicking and screaming from the tensor<br>
calculus-encrusted pages of impenetrable physics journals, black holes<br>
became sacred sites for `holistic' ninnies blissfully gobsmacked by big<br>
ideas but too lazy or too eager for cheap epiphanies to work at the hard<br>
details.  Exploring the astonishing prospect of the Spike puts us, unless<br>
we are very cautious, in danger of this unlovely fate, this black holism.<br>
<p>
Black holism is mush-headed theft of hard, rigorous, limited, testable<br>
ideas from science.  Yes, science is based on metaphor, of course, like all<br>
discourse, but that fact should not license the warping of its hard-won<br>
findings by desperados who wish to shore up their angst with a miasma of<br>
quantobabble.  Discussing Bell's non-locality theorem, quantum theorist<br>
Heinz Pagels noted scornfully: `Some recent popularizers... have gone on to<br>
claim that... the mystical notion that all parts of the universe are<br>
instantaneously interconnected is vindicated...  That is rubbish.'  You'd<br>
never know it from the happy zeal with which black holists wave the Bell<br>
theorem like a mantra.  Of the ensemble theory of quantum reality, Pagels<br>
asks: `And didn't John Wheeler, one of the physicists who helped develop<br>
this many-worlds view, finally reject it because, in his words, "It<br>
required too much metaphysical baggage to carry around"?'  Introducing a<br>
magisterial biography of quantum pioneer Niels Bohr, Professor Abraham Pais<br>
wrote recently: `I hope that the present account will serve to counteract<br>
the many cheap attempts at popularizing this subject, such as efforts by<br>
woolly masters at linking quantum physics to mysticism.'  (Wu Li Masters,<br>
indeed!)  Anyone with a grain of sense and taste will know what to do with<br>
such claims.  Certainly they won't erect a theory of Life, the Universe and<br>
Everything on such a corroded armature.  The salience and gravity of these<br>
themes - cosmos, consciousness, death - make such muddled syncretism so<br>
deplorable.  It will hardly serve to guide us up the slope of the Spike.<br>
	=09<br>
Physicist and educator Alan Cromer has argued that science can really only<br>
be done by people with formal operational skills, mental abilities defined<br>
by psychologist Jean Piaget, that inadequate schooling has failed to<br>
develop in perhaps half the adult population or more.  Without these tricks<br>
of objective thought, Cromer and Piaget argue, humans construct egocentric<br>
narratives about the universe based on projecting the inner world into the<br>
outer.  Ego-centric in the literal sense - their worlds are experienced as<br>
if actually projected outward from their own minds, indefinitely and<br>
directly malleable before the power of wish.  (Not even the hardest-nosed<br>
reductionist doubts that optimistic or self-paralysing attitudes can<br>
influence the way you act, which in turn changes both the parts of<br>
objective reality you deal with and modifies the attitudes of other<br>
people.)  Egocentrism is the assumption about the supposed top-down flow<br>
between (a, your) mind, and the world, which is made explicit in the sad<br>
little New Age slogan: You create your own reality.<br>
<p>
The non-intentional, self-organising properties of the universe emerges<br>
from the `bottom up', out of the properties of its small stupid parts,<br>
modified by the presence in the local neighbourhood of lots and lots of<br>
other tiny mindless parts.  This is true even if Stuart Kauffman and his<br>
Santa Fe colleagues are correct and complexity tends to emerge via a quite<br>
limited and fairly inevitable number of pathways.  The interactions of many<br>
small, stupid things tumbled together may form `attractors' in an abstract<br>
configuration space, but those mathematical attractors do not cause the<br>
behaviour they map and predict - not even to the extent that roads restrict<br>
and channel the routes we drive along. =20<br>
	=09<br>
Things in the world accrete by the principle of the racheting crane, as<br>
Daniel Dennett has neatly put it, and not by being tugged upward into the<br>
empyrean by some holistic sky-hook.  Once stuck together they often<br>
generate new `chunks' that thereafter manifest new and determinate<br>
properties not visible in their elementary parts, but this is because<br>
structure limits the degrees of freedom of those constituents.  My table<br>
holds up my computer because its small, stupid atoms lock together in a<br>
fairly stable, robust fashion, which they do by restricting each other in<br>
their mutual proximity. =20<br>
	=09<br>
Is that a holistic fact or a reductionist one?  Neither - it is an<br>
explanation of a local whole by an understanding (in broad, general terms)<br>
of its nanomolecular bits and pieces.  I am not talking about the human<br>
intentions which surely were crucial in selecting, shaping and connecting<br>
the pieces of wood into a table.  Nor do I mean the informational unfolding<br>
of the tree's DNA which turned organic chemicals into timber.  These<br>
organised patterns, wonderful as they are, remain parasitical upon the laws<br>
of quantum physics that obtain at the foundations of phenomenal reality.<br>
And our knowledge of those laws, and their physical manifestation, are<br>
utterly reductionist.<br>
	=09<br>
Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg cites Dostoyevsky's underground man: `Good<br>
God, what do I care about the laws of nature and arithmetic if for one<br>
reason or another I don't like these laws...'  Weinberg's scorn for this<br>
self-satisfied despair leads him into an awful pun: `At its nuttiest<br>
extreme are those with holistics in their heads, those whose reaction to<br>
reductionism takes the form of a belief in psychic energies, life forces<br>
that cannot be described in terms of the ordinary laws of inanimate<br>
nature.'  He adds, candidly: `The reductionist worldview is chilling and<br>
impersonal.  It has to be accepted as it is, not because we like it, but<br>
because that is the way the world works.'<br>
	=09<br>
Why, then, do so many people so ardently believe otherwise?=20<br>
	=09<br>
Our supreme eagerness to impute purpose, telos, narrative to the world<br>
arises because that is indeed an appropriate way to understanding the human<br>
realm, the regime of intentions for which our minds have evolved their<br>
special competence.  Minds, as we've seen, are more like rowdy parliaments<br>
than diamond crystals.  At the same time, like parliaments they operate<br>
through a selected speaker.  Oliver Sacks's An Anthropologist on Mars, for<br>
example, is rich with bizarre and illuminating tales about the mind and its<br>
breakdowns, especially autism and autistic gifts.  He gives powerful<br>
evidence for mental modularity, while insisting that what's missing in<br>
autism, say, is exactly a higher level of global organisation - a<br>
categorising self.  Is this holism or reductionism?  The complex reality,<br>
in a way, eludes simple labelling.  Finally, though, we are faced with<br>
wounded people whose global functions have failed to emerge, one way or<br>
another, from the parts that comprise them.  Yet clearly we are genetically<br>
structured to work as `selves', despite recent deconstructive bids to<br>
disperse the self. =20<br>
	=09<br>
At a recent seminar given by a young woman graduate student working on<br>
cyborgs, cyberspace and feminism, I heard much citation from Luce Irigaray<br>
and other poststructural gurus.  The performance was dazzling, impressively<br>
learned after its fashion, and... totally arbitrary.  No method was invoked<br>
for testing the assertions other than by their shock value, on the one<br>
hand, and their adherence to fashionable doxa, on the other.  When I asked<br>
why possibility X or Y had been discarded, I was told that the speaker just<br>
didn't think it was... didn't feel it was... didn't...  Next question,<br>
please.  I pressed her.  Hans Moravec claims X, I said, and he's one of the<br>
world's specialists in this field of artificial intelligence and robotics,<br>
so how can you just bypass his claims because you don't feel like liking<br>
them?  Er um, what I really wish to concentrate on is... =20<br>
	=09<br>
The road to black holism is lined with cognitive dissonance.<br>
	=09<br>
Another example: I fell into conversation with a New Age woman touted as<br>
enchanting and spiritually wise (utterly unlike me, in short).  I found her<br>
a sweet, kind, sickly sentimental, utterly gullible dipstick.  We had a<br>
very long and painful afternoon, interspersed by frantic cups of tea.  Each<br>
statement she made was weirder and more credulous than the item preceding<br>
it; the world was run on principles of numerology, and you can change<br>
traffic lights to green by wishing hard as you approach them, and aromas<br>
cured everything that ailed your body (except for the grave intestinal<br>
illness that had almost killed her months earlier, which was fixed in<br>
hospital by huge doses of cortisone - which she ungratefully and in<br>
retrospect dubbed toxic chemicals forced upon her by a crudely reductionist<br>
science), and the iris was connected to da hip-bone, and UFOs were driven<br>
by little grey aliens, and Sai Baba could levitate and pour endless<br>
quantities of dust out of his open hand and vomit up gold phalluses a foot<br>
long, and crystals had magical powers, and the Urantia Book was the source<br>
of all wisdom, such as the passages about how humans had evolved through<br>
the stages of Green Men and Purple Men and Blue Men, and... =20<br>
	=09<br>
At first I listened to this gibberish with wonderment, as if privileged in<br>
an anthropological way to observe a rare sub-culture of Pre-rational<br>
Humankind.  After a while (shame on me!) I gratuitously began to lecture<br>
the poor thing, in an increasingly frenetic and cross-disciplinary way, on<br>
alternative explanations for these phenomena that current science might put<br>
forward.  I ranted on, delivering myself of cognitive science explanations<br>
for just why she found such unsubstantiated hogwash so believable.  She<br>
reeled away hours later in a bruised mental condition, I gather, and I have<br>
never seen her since. =20<br>
	=09<br>
You might wonder, as I do: why did I feel impelled to set her straight?<br>
Leave aside whether I have any warrant for thinking that my book-larnin'<br>
gave me a grip on truth superior to her woolly word-of-mouth subcultural<br>
melange; of course I do.  But I don't stand on street corners preaching<br>
godlessness to passing Mormons.  This urge only comes over me when I find<br>
myself in a room with one or more black holists whose views affront me in<br>
their inanity and intellectual poverty.  Or, more importantly - not just<br>
their views, but their ways of deploying, testing, applying and revising<br>
those views. =20<br>
	=09<br>
Despite appearances, I am not especially dogmatic about any particular<br>
sub-sections of my world view.  Like a good many intellectuals struggling<br>
to keep their heads above the torrent of new books and journal articles and<br>
Internet postings, I modulate my opinions about quantum theory and<br>
cosmology and the structure of mind and society according to whichever<br>
brilliantly-argued source I read last.  But (no credit to me in this fact,<br>
of course) those somewhat flexible views form a kind of mutually-bracing<br>
geodesic structure of some power and grandeur.  And maybe they generate<br>
Dawkins-style memes that insist on broadcasting themselves and fighting<br>
opposing memes to the death. =20<br>
	=09<br>
Is holism a meme deserving of death, or at least retirement?  On the one<br>
hand, as we have seen, in some misleading sense everyone is a holist.  Who<br>
would deny that the simplest protein or even molecule manifests spontaneous<br>
self-organisation, folding, specificity, that could not easily be predicted<br>
from its components?  A fortiori for living critters and cultures.  But<br>
that does not imply there's something like a mind doing the shaping,<br>
putting in the complexity from the top down, which is the crucial step for<br>
most holists.  Nor is an emergent mentality at a level higher than the<br>
individual human especially consistent with the world we observe.  Despite<br>
alleged `synchronistic' events or coincidences, I recall my experiences<br>
rather than yours.  We simply don't remember the experiences of others.<br>
When I raise my hand to scratch my nose, your arm does not lift into the<br>
air instead.  We're firewalled by our skulls.  If there is a `holistic'<br>
channel, it is clearly very weak and noisy.<br>
	=09<br>
Top-down `holistic' lines of analysis reek to me of sad reports of African<br>
Ebola victims.  Owing to their ancient holistic wisdom, the luckless<br>
victims in Zaire know that the disease is caused by evil or enraged<br>
spirits, having nothing to do with anything so stupidly reductive as an<br>
infesting microorganism, so they're holistically bribing the guards who so<br>
unreasonably lock them away from the free exercise of their right to go<br>
hither and yon unchecked, spreading the damnable disease. =20<br>
	=09<br>
Granted, that isn't a very sophisticated brand of holism, and classy black<br>
holists can cite Paul Davies and Robertson Davies and for all I know Betty<br>
Davis in their cause - but it remains wrong-headed for just the same<br>
reasons that disease-demons are.  The nearest I have seen to a strong<br>
scientific case for physical holism is John Gribbin's recent Schr=F6dinger's<br>
Kittens, which promotes John Cramer's quantum theory as the Final Answer.<br>
Much is made of non-locality, of the strange connections from present to<br>
future and back to past that wind everything together in the Cramer model.<br>
One is obliged, learning of such models, to think a little more charitably<br>
about a certain kind of holistic hyper-connectivity.  But Cramer quantum<br>
theory does not support mysticism, and Gribbin himself steals backwards<br>
away from any such implication.<br>
	=09<br>
Reductionism has been faulted as evaluating credibility solely in terms of<br>
rational and empirical criteria.  One must not conflate the two, of course.<br>
 Any strict division between holist-introvert-intuitive and<br>
reductionist-extrovert-empiricist is vitiated exactly because each of us<br>
contains multitudes, and can shift modes depending on the demands of<br>
reality.  It's like `top down' versus `bottom up' - both strategies are<br>
constantly in play, and often interact by way of Douglas Hofstadter's<br>
Strange Loops.  If it turned out (as some believe) that people empirically<br>
tended to be healthier and happier if they organised their lives around<br>
ludicrous cosmological tenets, perhaps you would have to grit your teeth<br>
and endorse the practical `credibility' of these laughable or odious<br>
doctrines.  If it turned out that you really could build a better engine or<br>
ecology by analysing them in terms that allowed internal contradictions -<br>
that is, by being `non-rational', both A and not-A at once - a preference<br>
for the empirical might oblige you to adopt those practices, despite the<br>
outrage that would represent to classical logic.<br>
	=09<br>
Actually, it is arguable that quantum theory already requires the<br>
abandonment of syllogistic canons of reason.  And maybe pre-contact<br>
aboriginal lifestyles exemplify the life-style benefits of doing so.  (But<br>
give me electric lights, high-speed dental drills, and antibiotics any<br>
day).  On the other hand, quantal complementarity is either restricted to<br>
its tiny realm, or will prove to be just a stop-gap methodological kludge<br>
until a still better physics is devised.  And the social benefits of<br>
animism seem to me largely a by-product of the practical impotence of such<br>
doctrines.  If your medicine is based on magic and your economy on foraging<br>
(however much memory and skill is required in its practice), you fail to<br>
reach the population growth that, as its side-effects, can produce<br>
pandemics and arms races and power hierarchies and exponential re-entrant<br>
knowledge growth.  So among the benefits of believing incorrect things<br>
about the world is that you are restricted to such terrific holistic<br>
interventions as killing all the megafauna of an entire continent by<br>
burning the original ecology to the ground over a few tens of thousands of<br>
years...<br>
	=09<br>
Must materialists be reductionists?  (Presumably not: neuroscientist Steven<br>
Rose is a Marxist who repudiates reduction as a philosophical method, even<br>
if he adheres to it in the lab.)  Certainly it is a materialist position -<br>
whatever that means in a quantal universe where matter is congealed force -<br>
to reject all hypotheses or methodologies that posit any top-down aspects<br>
of reality not derived by evolution from fundamental forces and particles.<br>
That still leaves lots of weird windows, though. =20<br>
	=09<br>
It might be, for example, that human minds are, after all, somehow and in<br>
some respects quantally non-locally connected.  Or perhaps earlier<br>
intelligences arisen elsewhere in the galaxy have evolved by now to<br>
`godlike' estate and secretly run the universe.  Or maybe a Hoyle/Tipler<br>
end-of-eternity Time God works backward through time to re-arrange history<br>
(astonishing topics to which we'll return).  Or perhaps the phenomenal<br>
universe is actually and literally a cybersimulation in higher dimensional<br>
space, with us as sub-routines...  If any of these were true, then a<br>
rigorous materialism would indeed require top-down explanations of many<br>
phenomena at our human realm (as the Gaia hypothesis might turn out to do,<br>
although James Lovelock's originating version is strictly materialist).<br>
But there's no strong evidence that these merry conceits actually have a<br>
real-world instantiation (except, maybe, the ambiguous data from the best<br>
parapsychology labs). =20<br>
	=09<br>
In practice, reductionist hypotheses would seem preferable wherever<br>
possible, because that's the way science has reached its goals in the past.<br>
 Notably, non-reductionist models (elan vital, for example) have turned out<br>
to be misleading, based on bad analogies and wishful thinking.  But<br>
materialisms, too, can be `holistic' or non-reductionist, or claim to be;<br>
Marxism is only the most well-known.  None of this has much bearing on<br>
issues of the mind, of the Freud-versus-Jung variety, say, except that as a<br>
materialist I become wary (or even furious) when I hear intelligent people<br>
airily invoke `psychic energies' or `ids' or `Shadows' as if these<br>
metaphors possessed the same level of instrument-mediated reality as<br>
electron flows and dopamine titres.  Such figures might have a metaphoric<br>
allure given our current comparative ignorance of the mind/brain-body, but<br>
they drag us into explanatory culs de sac. =20<br>
	=09<br>
Watching Passions of the Mind, a series of television programs about the<br>
life and thought of Carl Jung, I was entertained in a horrified fashion by<br>
the way his acolytes handled Wolfgang Pauli's defection from the celebrated<br>
Jung-Pauli synchronicity hypothesis.  (The black holists never tell us<br>
about that apostasy, oddly enough.)  Pauli abandoned this great scientific<br>
truth, said his former analyst, because he could not face the deep inner<br>
mysteries of the Shadow.  These monsters therefore lay in horrid wait for<br>
him - and hence, she said with ill-disguised relish and self-satisfaction,<br>
he swiftly died of cancer.  Admittedly, psychological stress can be shown<br>
(empirically and rationally) to obstruct immunological function via a<br>
recently discovered brain chemo-modulator pathway... and so maybe stress<br>
hinders repair of early cancer cells.  Nonetheless, the claim that Pauli<br>
got cancer and died because he resisted Jungian analysis is deeply<br>
offensive and self-serving.  But quite typical of black holism's malicious<br>
or stupid magical thinking.<br>
	=09<br>
Well, perhaps that does not matter, if what counts is experiential richness<br>
of life.  For millennia, wise people have obviously lived wonderfully<br>
satisfying lives without the slightest notion that the earth goes around<br>
the sun or that the blood circulates or that tiny invisible animals make<br>
you sick.  But I cannot help thinking that to employ the best available<br>
physics and physiology has to be preferable to clinging to time-hallowed<br>
common-sense errors.  It would be a terrible travesty of intellectual<br>
justice if our dawning awareness of the on-rushing Spike became conscripted<br>
by black holists, warped into yet another comical New Age fantasy of<br>
effortless deliverance.<br>
