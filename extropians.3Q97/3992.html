<i>&gt;&gt;Although there are undoubtedly fundamentalists who would shriek that Faith</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;must reign supreme over Reason, there are also sane people, some of them with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;doctorates in physics, who would insist that every word of the Old Testament</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is unvarnished and unmetaphorical fact.  Many would take offense if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;suggested that their belief is not "in accordance with or sensitive to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;evidence and reasons".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;While it is not my intention to intervene in religious disputes at this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;time - I feel we'll all know who was right soon enough - I do feel it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;necessary to remind everyone that there are sincerely and unapologetically</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;religious people, who are often involved with charitable issues and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;generally spread a little Light around, even if it is in the name of God. </i><br>
<p>
How /more/ good could they do if they gave up their irrational faith?<br>
I'm personally quite fond of many religious practices--in fact I'm<br>
contemplating founding a religion myself.  Such things as building a<br>
community, teaching a moral foundation, maintaining history, organizing<br>
celebrations and ceremonies, and coordinating long-term projects are<br>
very good things--but none of them require irrational faith, or God, or<br>
any of the other silly things most religions waste time on.  If the<br>
people doing those good things are offended by those of us who disdain<br>
faith, then maybe they'll be encouraged to do those same things for<br>
rational reasons.  It is irrational for me to hold my tongue solely for<br>
their discomfort.  If they take offense at my simple, honest expression<br>
of my beliefs, that's far more intolerant of them than my desire to<br>
express beliefs that don't happen to match theirs.<br>
