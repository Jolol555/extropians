     Anders Sandberg wrote (regarding a meteor that fell on Australia in <br>
     1969):<br>
     <br>
     I'm sceptical; saying it is fungi and bacteria sounds a bit too bold.<br>
     It is likely that the newspaper has distorted the news somewhat.<br>
     Looking through the web suggests that Dr Richard Hoover isn't<br>
     involved in meteor research, although he seems to be interested in<br>
     diatoms.<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight:<br>
     <br>
     I read today that bacteria has been discovered 2 miles below the <br>
     surface of the earth.  Don't know much about geology (sounds like a <br>
     song...) but I'd assume 2 miles deep is a bit inhospitable for all but <br>
     the most robust tiny life forms.  So what if there's microbes on Mars? <br>
     We all blew out from the same stellar stuff billions of years ago.  <br>
     Maybe Mars was a resort planet at one time.  Looks like a pretty red <br>
     rock now!  Am I being callous?  Perhaps.  I just don't see what the <br>
     big deal is.  Does the notion of life, ANY life, however microscopic, <br>
     really impact our place in the universe much.  Seems to me like even <br>
     the religious zealots would be shrugging their shoulders.  I much <br>
     prefer our research dollars going towards restoring and improving <br>
     earth conditions and listening for "come back" signals from out there. <br>
     <br>
