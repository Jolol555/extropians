I think widespread nanotech would be a wonderful thing, if we could do it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  So, everyone has the means and the ability to make whatever they want in</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotech.  Someone, somewhere is working away building their back goo.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Meanwhile *everyone everywhere* are working towards ways to improve their</i><br>
<i>&gt; defense in case this someone somewhere attacks (the people are aware of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; danger, because nothing is hiden from them).  Who's going to win - billions</i><br>
<i>&gt; of people who want to live, or one that wants to kill?</i><br>
<p>
The one that wants to kill.<br>
<p>
Besides, it's not going to be one psychotic, it's going to be entire psychotic<br>
governments, or even the entire Chinese government which, though sane, might<br>
realize it couldn't dominate a population with access to nanotechnology.  Give<br>
the Chinese government nanotechnology and they will launch an all-out effort<br>
to create a preemptive strike.<br>
<p>
Add this to the advantage in relative development speeds ('mune is much more<br>
complicated) and in strategy and tactics on the molecular level (as<br>
discussed), and not only will there be a war, but the Chinese will win - that<br>
is, if we confine ourselves to defense.<br>
<p>
Now, the U.S. knows this as well as I do.  So do all the other governments. <br>
They will revert to the tried and true doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction.<br>
<p>
The end result is that all the governments have nano-arsenals.  None of them<br>
trust each other.  As with Anti-Ballistic-Missile systems, any proposed 'mune<br>
will be treated as upsetting the balance of power.  Any attempt to set up a<br>
'mune system would probably provoke a first strike.  Meanwhile, the Chinese<br>
government is oppressing the living hell out of their populations.  All the<br>
governments are doing their damndest to prohibit all nanotechnology to their<br>
citizens.  And NOW these governments have the power to do WHATEVER THEY WANT...<br>
<p>
Not that they'll be doing it for long.  Soon there will be a very short war.<br>
<p>
Giving nanotech to one person is taking a big chance.<br>
Giving nanotech to all governments is simple suicide.<br>
