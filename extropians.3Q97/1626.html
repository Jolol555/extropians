<p>
I've seen slightly better (imho) argument.  While most of the world<br>
was pantheist or polytheist, Christians are monotheist and the Chinese<br>
concept of god was less personal.  If a polytheist's experiment fails,<br>
he can try asking a different god for help; a monotheist, deist or<br>
atheist knows that there's only one Natural Law for everybody.<br>
<p>
(Socrates, if I understand right, was a monotheist.)<br>
