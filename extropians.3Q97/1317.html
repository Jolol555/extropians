In a message dated 97-07-29 20:06:01 EDT, I said:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
<i> &gt;Reference : SHIVA a science fiction book of some years ago which postulated</i><br>
<i> &gt;drawing power from the Ionospher by "shorting' it to ground using laser</i><br>
beams<br>
<i> &gt;to ionize a path.</i><br>
<p>
And you said:<br>
 <br>
 I haven't seen this. Is it good hard SF?<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
I seem to recall that it was published in the 70s...next time I stop by the<br>
house I'll check...I NEVER throw a book I like away.  not really good hard<br>
SF....I'd say the giggle factor is about 50%<br>
<p>
And I said:<br>
<i>&gt;Reference: Forest Bishops Web Page...his article on an Antartic Mass Driver</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Orbital  Catapult )</i><br>
<p>
And You said;<br>
<p>
Please, it is called "South Pole Accelerator". The reason I name my <br>
inventions/concepts is to assist in my claim to them- the same reason<br>
parents name their children.<br>
<p>
<p>
Sorry...no offence...best I could remember at the time...then..as now...I had<br>
no access to the web.<br>
<p>
And You said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Roswell New Mexico</i><br>
^^^^^^^^            And how's it going in the hometown?<br>
<p>
Roswell was fine...Not my hometown...got a fair truckstop...and a middlin<br>
bookstore...drop mucho dinero in both.<br>
<p>
<p>
They're making a big deal about the Aliens..(alien this and alien<br>
that....billboards, signs, bars etc.)  The notiarity is making them a fair<br>
amount of money.<br>
