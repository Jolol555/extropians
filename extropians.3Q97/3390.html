In a message dated 97-09-11 08:11:02 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And starve?  In the US?  I don't THINK so.  Not unless they are terminally</i><br>
<i>&gt;  stupid...too many freeebies available.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
That is the most callous thing I have ever heard. While Iagree 100% about the<br>
freebies, I am completely offended at your words about terminal stupidity. I<br>
think it reflects on you badly. I don't know you so I won't make any<br>
judgement about your own intelligence.<br>
And as for people not starving, well... I have different data than you. I<br>
don't THINK <br>
one way or the other ( research is better than MUSE-ing over this subject)<br>
but I have read about urban and rural starvation and undernourishment in<br>
infants and toddler development and how it affects physiological and mental<br>
developement. It can indeed, create a terminal kind of stupidity and it is<br>
nothing to laugh abuot. Cry <br>
about maybe, but not taunt or jeer.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In the not too distant past the average life expectancy was ......20.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
This is very unfounded to my knowledge. Where do you collect your facts?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;By that standard I'm working on three life spans...and NO ONE could call me</i><br>
<i>&gt;rich....I'm just a poor ole truck driver.....work my 100 hrs a week (give or</i><br>
<i>&gt;take) and be glad to have it...</i><br>
<p>
; - )<br>
Yes i am glad you are a hard worker. That is a good thing in my value system<br>
as well. But it isn't much of an argument. <br>
