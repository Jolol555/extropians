What if I sign up for cryonics, then tomorrow a meteor falls on me and<br>
annihilates every last neuron in my brain?  To me, these are the same<br>
question. The answer: I have lost the game of life... but at least I<br>
tried.  Hopefully, I'll get an 'A' for effort.  Maybe Tipler is right<br>
about that Omega Point-- that's what I'll be hoping when I look up at that<br>
meteor.<br>

Very excellent point... but the solution to this is to simply evolve<br>
faster than my and everyone else's autonomous computers.<br>
<p>
Maybe 'simply' is the wrong word.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'm more intelligent than a computer right now (if you were really nasty,</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not saying it will, but it might, should either or both of my "what if"s</i><br>

<p>
I don't buy it.<br>
<p>
I cannot see a highly superior population of autonomous computers caring<br>
one bit about collaboration with human beings.  This would be like us<br>
colloborating with mosquitoes... why would we do it?  They're<br>
infinitely more stupid than me are, and all they do is suck our blood.  I<br>
prefer to swat them.  Imagine if mosquitoes were our masters, how long<br>
would that last?<br>
