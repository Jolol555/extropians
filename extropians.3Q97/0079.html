What do you think would be valid indications that one has the capacity<br>
to be redeemed? The one doing the indicating is the criminal himself.<br>
Are any of his or her indications ever to be trusted and thereby termed<br>
valid?<br>
<p>
I suppose we're talking about repeat offenders who have shown no<br>
capacity for redemption. In such a case, how many tries does a criminal<br>
get? Or using the prior discourse, how many times must a criminal<br>
recidivate before he has demonstrated his or her lack of capacity for<br>
redemption?<br>

<p>
I (stick neck out) would suggest that all material is capable of being<br>
recycled. Especially as scarce and valuable a material as intelligent<br>
life.<br>
<p>

<p>
Do you think that people are always responsible for their actions? I<br>
tend to waffle on this point (to a fault), so I hope you might let me<br>
pick your brain a bit.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I value human life highly. So highly that I feel that people who do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; value human life do not value their own life enough to go on living.</i><br>
<p>
So then the reason for frying them is not that they do not value other<br>
human lives, but rather that they do not value their own? Or is it a<br>
combination of the two? To take this further along the so-called<br>
tangent, why is human life any different than other life? Unless we are<br>
talking about sentience, life is life is life. I would argue that to<br>
value human life to the exclusion of all other life is not valuing life<br>
at all. It is homophilia, maybe evolutionary, but merely an innate wish<br>
to see the species continue. Do you think that you might be talking<br>
about valuing intelligent life?<br>
<p>
