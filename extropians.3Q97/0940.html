Robin Hanson:<br>
<i>&gt;This sounds a bit conspiracy-theorist to me.  How exactly would all</i><br>
<i>&gt;social institutions be hurt by behavior that helps people understand</i><br>
<i>&gt;how gender is constructed?</i><br>
<p>
I think that prior to responding to your question I need you to <br>
re-read the post you took it from.  The first paragraph summarizes <br>
Lorber's premise, and the second paragraph forms the logical <br>
extension vis-a-vis the response of societal institutions to a <br>
transgressive act.<br>
<p>
Most people who have read Lorber have a strong reactions to her work, <br>
but she is widely acknowledged as a formidable intellect, with an <br>
impressive editorial and academic resume--throwing around terms like <br>
'conspiracy theorist' seems a shallow, almost knee-jerk response to <br>
her work.<br>
