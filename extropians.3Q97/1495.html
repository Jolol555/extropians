<i>&gt;I heard that science cured a blind person (he was blind since birth) but when</i><br>
<i>&gt;they cured him he freaked out and couldnt handle it.  It was a total new</i><br>
<i>&gt;dimension to his consciousness, you have to prepare for that spiritually.</i><br>

<p>
Danny, you may be thinking of the work done with the last generation of<br>
syphilis <br>
eye infection patients a few decades ago. Their corneas were clouded at birth<br>
and at best they could distinguish light from dark. Later surgery like that<br>
developed for cataract patients was employed in an attempt to give these<br>
people<br>
a clear visual path. <br>
<p>
The best information I have on that is that many of the "cured" patients<br>
could <br>
not interpret images at all, found the new input upsetting because it was<br>
"just <br>
noise", and went back to wearing dark glasses. Is babble in a language you <br>
don't understand "a total new dimension to [your] consciousness?"<br>
<p>
This is not to imply that I don't understand *your* language.<br>
<p>
My bogometer is in the red. Not to be negative or anything, but... *PLONK*<br>
