The problem is that this is a very difuse energy<br>
source, so you need a fairly big installation. However,<br>
if you mostly want to use low-density energy (as in home<br>
heating and cooling) you can in fact use well, stream, or<br>
lake water effectively in an open-loop configuration, or<br>
you can bury a bunch of polybutylene pipes about 4 feet<br>
underground and circulate water in a closed- loop system.<br>
There are companies that install residential geothermal systems.<br>
They use electrically-driven heat pumps to boost from the 56<br>
degree F ground temp to the house temp in the winter. These<br>
systems have a high capital cost, but a very low running cost. <br>
   I just did an altavista search (+home +geothermal) and got<br>
a bunch of stuff, including<br>
   <a href="http://www.cpco.com/electric/home.html">http://www.cpco.com/electric/home.html</a><br>
I'd love to play with this stuff with the goal of replacing the<br>
electric pumps with rankin or stirling engines using a working<br>
fluid with a vapor temp in the corrrect range, and using solar<br>
boost. I suspect that this is feasible, but its not economical<br>
for me: I work for a living. However, consider the implications<br>
for when nanotech is available. You can get all the energy you<br>
need for heating and cooling by running a closed-loop pipe in<br>
the ground, horizontally or vertically, about 200 feet of pipe<br>
per 1000 square feet of living space. A bit more pipe for<br>
domestic water heating, maybe a bit more to power the system and<br>
to boost for cooking. the remainder of your current domestic<br>
power demand is near zero. So, nanotech frees you from the<br>
power grid.<br>
