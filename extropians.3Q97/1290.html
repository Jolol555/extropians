Yes. But in that case he won't complain, instead he will hype his<br>
research, use plenty of buzzwords ("java based connectionist agents<br>
in intranets") and warn that the japanese are doing the same<br>
research. <br>
<p>
Real scientists get their chance to get even once they got their<br>
Nobel prize, Fields medal or whatever - they can spend all day<br>
telling their awed audience the hardships they had to suffer to<br>
discover their great discovery, how science policy should really<br>
work, and immortalize their old nemesis with some witty remark. :-) <br>

I have not had the time (and will not have the time) to seriously<br>
evaluate them. I'm fairly sceptical, for the simple reason that they<br>
have not produced any truly noticeable demonstrations. If they really<br>
are on to something, it would be easy for them to produce some<br>
dramatic effect showing that significant energy is produced ("do this<br>
and the lab explodes") that would convince even the sceptics. So far<br>
it has been very quiet; as far as I know no papers published in the<br>
major journals, no wild press releases (in itself a good sign). But<br>
this is just a quick impression, I haven't followed the field at all. <br>
