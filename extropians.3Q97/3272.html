     Hi,<br>
     <br>
     Has anyone become familiar with this association?  They are into <br>
     dispensing information (at a cost) in a direct marketing motif to <br>
     educate people on the Federal Reserve Bank, offshore/foreign <br>
     investing, common law, reducing/eliminating taxes, what the US <br>
     Constitution means to "YOU", etc.  The claim is there is substantial <br>
     money-making power in the information they have to offer and there <br>
     seems to be an anarchist feel to it (which I find somewhat <br>
     intriguing).<br>
     <br>
     I have more research to do on it but I do have a sense of trust in the <br>
     person that introduced me to the concept.  The fellow leading the <br>
     organization is Keith Anderson and they have all their seminars in the <br>
     Caribbean or Mexico.  It costs $1250 to get their first 12 hours of <br>
     audiotapes of information.<br>
     <br>
     A while back there was a thread here about making money in offshore <br>
     investing.  Any connection between those posts and this organization?<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
