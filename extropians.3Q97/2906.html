I do grant that in practice most of the world will be protected by<br>

True by default these days, since cities haven't figured out how to feed<br>
themselves yet.  If we skip over that barrier, however, protected cities<br>
will outevolve attack goo precisely because they are all the intelligent<br>
life.  See below.<br>

<p>
&lt;Boggle&gt;  The _sea_ will "reach that level of technology"?  This is a<br>
sea of mindless goo, no?  Even if it's backed by someone intelligent,<br>
we're still talking one lab versus a city -- more likely, many, many<br>
cities.  It is the city which needs a minimum level of technology --<br>
concrete moats and waterhoses in one of my scenarios -- to fend off the<br>
sea while *it* advances such that it can fight off the sea with<br>
increasing ease, and later regard it as so much raw material.<br>
<p>
You've also ignored my claim that as the first nanotech is likely to be<br>
based on nearly pure carbon even vast seas of it will be controllable<br>
through burning.<br>
<p>
<p>
I'd also like to provide a much more basic reason why it would be<br>
completely irrational for the first "nanopower" to try to wipe out the<br>
world so that they can take over the universe.  What are they going to<br>
do with the universe?  They're a nanotech research lab.  Do they know<br>
how to use nanotech to make food?  Perhaps they can just copy that (hope<br>
they copied some ethnic restaurants first) but what will happen when they<br>
catch a disease?  Develop cancer?  Or Alzheimer's?  Will they know how<br>
to build an airplane -- they can copy one, but can they modify it?  Can<br>
they build a spaceship?  Drextech is a miraculous tool, but it will take<br>
knowledge to apply, knowledge a nanolab will probably not have.<br>
Particularly if nanotech comes before AI or detailed neuro-knowledge.<br>
If the lab waits for the latter, other labs will develop nanotech.  If<br>
it strikes to exploit its temporary lead, it won't know what to do with<br>
it.<br>
<p>
"Do you think so little of the art of carpentry, than any man can pick<br>
up a hammer and build a barn which does not fall down, no matter how<br>
much he hits his thumb and curses?" -- a mage to his student, by Robin<br>
McKinley.  The world is complex, and civilization more so.  Nanotech is<br>
not a genie which can replace it all.<br>
