Here's quite a long piece by me from the August 1997 issue of The New York<br>
Review of Science Fiction, an admirable monthly journal I recommend to<br>
anyone seriously interested in sf (they have a web site):<br>
<p>
Spares by Michael Marshall Smith<br>
New York: Bantam Books, 1997; $22.95; 321 pages<br>
reviewed by Damien Broderick<br>
<p>
Look, this reviewing caper has its quandaries.  I'm prattling away in one<br>
corner of someone's kitchen to a couple of pals who know the genre, the<br>
mode, whatever the hell it is, and a young women who knows very little<br>
about sf sticks her head in, a little puzzled, raises a question that shows<br>
she's never read Martin Amis, or maybe even heard of Cordwainer Smith, and<br>
the self-satisfied verities jolt across the sudden narrows, wander into<br>
sidebar data-dumps, or nose-dive into confused silence.  <br>
<p>
Who are we doing this for?  How much are we suppressing, anyway, in this<br>
supposition that we are indeed `we', with some joint stock of common<br>
truths, perceptions, positions, cultural capital?  Is the review sub specie<br>
aeternitatis, as it often comically pretends, or du jour?  Who's the<br>
babbling loon sitting here in judgement of someone's months or years of<br>
effort, who's this arrogant character asserting with a straight face that<br>
for the duration (a thousand or so words) `Science fiction, c'est moi'?<br>
<p>
Just now it's me.  What follows does not pretend to be the word of God,<br>
even when the shape of reviewing language makes it sound as if that's what<br>
I'm trying to marionette.<br>
<p>
I just read a book I'd never heard of, by an author ditto.  It took me<br>
weeks, and was not fun.  The packaging of my `advance reading copy' was<br>
minimal, less than you'll find in the stores.  It told me that Spares will<br>
soon be `a major motion picture' from Spielberg's Dreamworks company.  This<br>
is not a good start.  Most mass media sf is dire, debased.  By contagion,<br>
you suspect that anything deemed suitable for translation into big<br>
Spielberg candy came pre-digested as pap.  Not always - not Empire of the<br>
Sun, after all, not The Color Purple, maybe not Keneally's Schindler's Ark.<br>
 But the title here is not encouraging, especially given the happy<br>
coincidence (I write in March, 1997) of Dolly the woolly clone.  What luck<br>
for Mr Smith!  How much better luck, of course, if Dolly had made the 11<br>
o'clock picture opportunity after the movie.  Maybe the first human clone<br>
will drop in on time.<br>
<p>
Are these maunderings suitable to a review of a book (I learn after a foray<br>
into the Net) by the winner, for his first novel, Only Forward, of the<br>
August Derleth Award?  Paul McAuley, a wonderful writer, recommends Smith's<br>
`clutch of fine short stories', telling me that he is `a hot new dark<br>
horror/SF writer, who sort of wandered into the genre without knowing too<br>
much about it, rather like Jeff Noon.'  Yes.  Smith is a mass media man who<br>
wrote for some British Radio 4 program called `And Now, in Colour', and<br>
today is scripting the mini-series adaptation of Clive Barker's vast and<br>
legless Weaveworld.  Yes, and he was born in 1968 in Cheshire, England, but<br>
has lived in the USA, South Africa, Australia, and now is back in the UK.<br>
Do we need to know all this, we readers?  Most don't know the least thing,<br>
or care, I'm told, about the authors or their lives, literary views,<br>
politics, marital status, number of functioning limbs.  I do, because I'm<br>
steeped in the mega-text, which is a net for trawling up whole struggling<br>
ecologies from the deep.<br>
<p>
Spares, eh?  Before opening the covers you knowing sf knowers know<br>
something of what you'll meet.  Cloned copies of the rich and famous,<br>
something like that, kept on ice or otherwise quiet, culled in emergencies<br>
for their histocompatible organs (proof against immediate immune system<br>
attack by the recipient).  Like zombies they will rise, taking their<br>
revenge as Other against the smug, hegemonic Self.  Or they will be set<br>
free (as they are in Lois McMaster Bujold's Mirror Dance) against their own<br>
ferocious and indignant, or just muddled, opposition.  And all of it likely<br>
to be a category mistake, a congeries of dumb errors, so blatant and<br>
infuriating that you wish the author had a dozen necks so that he might be<br>
hanged more than once for his crimes.<br>
<p>
Well, Spares is all that and worse, but also more than that, and strikingly<br>
better, here and there, in bricolaged patches that peel off like organs<br>
stitched together without much concern for their mutual coding.  That kind<br>
of audacity is fun.  You can be reading some conventional evocation of<br>
visceral horror (`Vinaldi and I stopped running, our chests suddenly filled<br>
with liquid fire.  I reeled off into the bushes and vomited<br>
uncontrollably') and lurch right into Martin Amis trade-marked wry: `Bodies<br>
are great, and I wouldn't go anywhere without mine, but sometimes they're<br>
so disappointing.  If we mistreated them as badly as we do our minds then<br>
everyone would be dead, and yet there they go, complaining all the time.<br>
Someone needs to get all our bodies, sit them down, and give them a good<br>
talking to.'<br>
<p>
But this isn't really a Robert Sheckley knockoff, so whimsy takes it only<br>
so far.  Its generic cut-ups echo a certain non-stop hallucinogenic<br>
whirlpool which is the narrator's Rapt-ruined brain, but the central<br>
seriousness (I suppose it is) gets compromised again and again by cheap<br>
theatrics, or bleugh yuck Barkeresque set-pieces, or Hitchhiker's Guide<br>
frolics, and those dumb, dumb, truly stupid trope snowcrashes.  <br>
<p>
Here's a Douglas Adams bit: Our guys (ragged breathing, bang bang the guns<br>
at their backs) slam into an xPress elevator and Jack Randall, our main<br>
guy, lights up.  The elevator's droid halts between floors and delivers a<br>
tiresome health lecture.  Jack's not going to be stalled by a politically<br>
correct machine.  `"Where are your cognitive centers stored?" I asked,<br>
racking a shell into the barrel of my gun... "And can the elevator function<br>
without them?"<br>
<p>
`"Yes it can," the elevator said, with an air of slight puzzlement...<br>
<p>
`"Because,' I said, `if you don't shut the fuck up I'm going to blow you to<br>
shit and then spend the rest of the journey smoking in comfort.  I may even<br>
have a cigar.'"<br>
<p>
Fun-ny, as Homer Simpson would say appreciatively.  But in the context of a<br>
story set in the 22nd century, we're being told that nobody in a century or<br>
more has ever before scammed an AI, or if they did nobody reported the<br>
fault, or if they reported it nobody worked out how to fix the glitch.  Or<br>
am I being way too dully earnest here?  After all, the story is set in New<br>
Richmond, which is a city that grew out of a five-mile square aerial<br>
shopping Mall whose engines failed one day.  It is a sort of Blishean<br>
Cities-Not-In-Flight, a kind of Ballardian Really-High-Rise, a merry gag<br>
that never quite takes off because it's stuck on the ground to begin with.<br>
<p>
I was once sent a feminist woman's sf novel entitled, unpromisingly,<br>
Wingwomen of Hera.  It started with some astronomy:<br>
<p>
`Two planets hung in a quiet corner of space, revolving in leisurely orbits<br>
around their two suns...<br>
<p>
`[A] comet fell between the two planets, coming so close to the second that<br>
all landgrowths spontaneously burst into flames and the seas boiled at the<br>
same moment.  But not close enough to pull either planet into its lethal<br>
embrace.<br>
<p>
`As its tail lashed them, both planets were pulled away from their<br>
comfortable orbits, reeling crazily until they found and settled into new<br>
paths of destiny.<br>
<p>
`The first planet now swung in a slow figure eight around both of the<br>
suns,' and so on and so forth.  I did not read any further.<br>
<p>
Was it unfair of me to be offended by such culpable ignorance, such<br>
`poetic' tosh?  The author, one Sandi Hall, and her publisher,<br>
Spinsters/Aunt Lute, of San Francisco, might have felt that I was being<br>
unduly severe.  But I didn't care.  Ms Hall was playing, as Gregory Benford<br>
might say, without the net up.  Indeed, I doubt she had ever heard of the<br>
net.  I'm pretty sure Mr Smith, too, is innocent of that informal contract<br>
which binds us to make sense in science fiction, even when the high point<br>
of our novel is peeling off a child's face and sticking it on the front of<br>
the television set.<br>
<p>
The big problem, the one that won't sink down and go away nicely, is the<br>
Spares, of course.  They live in horrid humid tunnels, the Farm, where<br>
bruised Jack has wandered after barely surviving the Vietnam War, sorry,<br>
The Gap War, where they went into the jungle and killed and raped the<br>
uncomprehending, incomprehensibly violent villagers and children (`often<br>
used by the villagers to carry mines') who lived in the North, appearing<br>
and disappearing through a confusion of military-industrial quantities of<br>
drugs.  Jack, reduced by a domestic horror that we finally meet on page 116<br>
and a military atrocity on page 278, oversees and tends the mindless Spares<br>
who blunder in the Farm's tunnels, until he takes upon himself the<br>
redemptive task of teaching them to be human.  <br>
<p>
These are teenagers who have never had the least socialising, and who are<br>
regularly mined for organs, limbs and other portions of their persons, and<br>
beaten and raped between times.  There is a word for such unfortunates:<br>
`wolf-children'.  In the real world wolf-children are, and remain, mute,<br>
barely human, even when they're caught young and treated with great  care.<br>
Jack teaches some of them to read.  Then he cracks his aptest students out<br>
of the Farm and takes them on a ruinous saga, blundering forward in a path<br>
that reflects, unless I'm mistaken, the author's anguished real-time search<br>
for a plot.<br>
<p>
I won't try to explain the plot he stitched up, because it wouldn't be fair<br>
and because it doesn't matter a hoot.  There are mock-Lacanian essays in<br>
explanation: <br>
<p>
`"...the fucking Gap... It's making people think things that aren't true."<br>
I told him that it was true now.  That it was seepage, stuff that should be<br>
unconscious become conscious.  The planet's dreams, seeping through the<br>
wall like hallucinations on the edge of sleep.'  <br>
<p>
You can get a long way with an explanatory device like that.  But once<br>
you've got there, where have you got?  `I believe The Gap is made up of all<br>
the places where no one is, of all the sights which no one sees.  It comes<br>
from silence, and lack, and the deleted and unread; it is the gap between<br>
what you want and what you have...'  Desire as absence, as Lack.  Well,<br>
yes, ho hum.<br>
<p>
What I Lacked, dragging myself unwillingly though a book I'd agreed to<br>
review, was some explanation for how Smith thought he could get away with<br>
the fundamental dumbness of his titular idea.  What he's trying to blend is<br>
schlock horror and genuine science, casting aside the guidance of fifty<br>
years of cloning as a well-plumbed, highly developed sf trope.  I'm not<br>
blaming him for going off on his own.  I'm complaining because of where he<br>
went.  Look at the logic of the thing.<br>
<p>
Against the law, one gathers (not that there is much, for this is a crude<br>
police state where the rich and lofty own the police) rich people have set<br>
up reserves of genetically identical copies of their children, a year or<br>
two younger.  Evidently they have no feelings of kinship for these twins.<br>
And only one copy per donor, apparently, but maybe there is some<br>
redundancy, for there is more than one Farm.  At any rate, the rich have<br>
gone to the trouble of cloning their kids, lest something awful happen to<br>
these scions.  And this is the condition of their ambulatory organ-banks:<br>
<p>
`Twice a day, a medic drone checks vital responses and gives each spare a<br>
carefully designed package of foodstuffs to ensure that it grows and<br>
develops in tandem with its twin. [!]   Sometimes the droids'll get them to<br>
move around a bit, so their muscles don't atrophy.  [!!]  Apart from that,<br>
all the spares know is one long endless twilight of blue heat...  The<br>
doctors find the right spare, cut off what they need, and then shove it<br>
back in the tunnel.  There it lies, and rolls, and persists, until they<br>
need it again.'  `[M]angled and dissected bodies stumped around them,<br>
clapping hands with no fingers together, rubbing their faces against the<br>
walls and letting shit run down their legs.'<br>
<p>
Yes, I guess that'd be the optimum way to ensure that your medical back-up<br>
is in peak condition for the rare disaster when you'll require a graft or<br>
organ transplant.  But wait a minute - rare disaster?  The SafetyNet Farms<br>
are less than 20 years old.  A clone is useless to anyone except the<br>
original donor.  So what are these hapless creatures doing with no fingers,<br>
or missing limbs or eyes?  Even at my advanced age I don't know anyone who<br>
needs a compatible major body part.  True, given the amount of feckless<br>
gun-play reported in the novel, these people are careless with their fleshy<br>
parts.  But this careless?<br>
<p>
Even Michael Marshall Smith is embarrassed by the absurdity.  He mumbles a<br>
bit as he mentions the exemplary case of Steven Two and his `brother out in<br>
the big room' who was `a real piece of work'.  Steven Prime crushed one<br>
hand in a car door at 10.  `A little discomfort for a while, some tiresome<br>
physio sessions, but he ended up whole again.'  I wonder if Smith has ever<br>
broken a major bone, or had eye surgery.  You wouldn't be eager to go<br>
through that again.  But Steve was such a rotter that at 17 his face was<br>
scalded by a woman scorned, so the doctors `took his brother's face away'.<br>
That would be the way to do it.  Just peel it off, I suppose, and pop it on<br>
the scraped surface.<br>
<p>
And the SafetyNet doctors have a strange idea of the impact of stress on<br>
the human body.  `The operations on the spares were never made under<br>
anesthetic, [just] muscle paralyzer...'<br>
<p>
In other words, we have here Grand Guignol under the pretence of medical<br>
science, and it doesn't stand still for an instant when you pay it the<br>
mildest scrutiny.<br>
<p>
It would have made more sense to kludge the science more boldly, as others<br>
have done before.  Solve the rejection problem, and a single body-shop<br>
spare can be mined by numerous purchasers.  That way you can whittle down<br>
your victims without making a complete fool of the reader.  Even so, it's<br>
hard to make sense of the economics of `spare hands [with] no fingernails<br>
left, only ragged and bleeding tips, when internal organs were found to be<br>
so bruised they were barely usable, when spares' skins showed evidence of<br>
cuts and burns which did not tally with any official activity'.  Smith<br>
makes some sort of attempt to rationalise these atrocities, and their<br>
acceptance by those who pay to sustain their children's spares (it's the<br>
pathology of The Gap, poisoning everyone it touched), but by that stage we<br>
aren't just playing with the net down, we've abandoned our racquets and balls.<br>
<p>
Enough.  I'm taking my bat and ball home.<br>
<p>
Silly.  Sorry.  Too silly, or not silly enough.<br>
