This conference, as the one's in the past have been achievements.  They<br>
continue to expand and each one is rewarding.<br>

I enjoyed this panel because it did give me an opportunity to take the<br>
audience into the future, if only for a short time.<br>

<p>
The future of gender was in my specific talk, sorry you missed it.  I didn't<br>
put a lot of emphasis on "gender" per se, because my area of discussion was<br>
"sexuality."  However, I did bring up new types of genders and stated that<br>
there will be such enormous shifts in sexuality that it will affect gender.<br>
A really wonderful moment was when I was asked what I thought about a<br>
specific gender scenario as presented by Lenny Shaw from the audience.  I<br>
stated quite clearly that being gender balanced and gender biased was not a<br>
transhumanist approach, in my view and alluded to other appoaches.  At that<br>
point, Dave Krieger, also from the audience, stepped up to the mic and<br>
addressed the issue and presented his professional workplace as an example<br>
of a mixture of genders to concur.  I think it was summed up quite<br>
excellently by Dave.  I then took hold of the issue and make my final<br>
comments in a summation of transhumanist ideas about gender.  <br>
<p>
It was unfortunate that Kathryn Ageis did not attend the discussion for two<br>
reasons.  First, and noteworthy, I intentionally cut my talk in half in<br>
deference to Kathryn and anyone else in the audience who I knew would want<br>
to openly discuss sexuality. I even called out to her one time during my<br>
talk, and during questions and answers, asked Kathryn to come to the mic. It<br>
is unfortuante she wasn't available. The second reason why I think this was<br>
unfortunate is because silence cannot be heard. <br>
<p>
If anyone has a voice that desires to be heard, the best way to address<br>
ideas and issues is to come to the very format where they are being<br>
discussed.  The adverse is not a positive contribution.  Fortunately,<br>
neither Sharon nor Chris were aware of this at the time and it did not<br>
interfere with their presentations.<br>
<p>
Both Sharon and Chris made important contributions.  I might not agree with<br>
both of them, or either of them.   BUT they, as anyone else at the<br>
conference have a right to be heard, they were panelists.<br>
<p>
Regardless of this glitch that you so dramatically mentioned, and the<br>
uneasiness it caused, I had a lot of fun for my few minutes discussing<br>
sexuality.<br>
