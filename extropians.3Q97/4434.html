I can't find my copy of the book, but I was always struck by what<br>
must have been the translation of the poem about a haircut - cleverly<br>
rhymed, with every word beginning withe the letter S, as the challenge<br>
went.  The result is fairly widely quoted and attributed to Lem.<br>
But presumably he did not write it in anything like the English<br>
language form.  I wonder how it is done in other languages?<br>

Seduced, shaggy Samson snored.<br>
She scissored short.  Sorely shorn,<br>
Soon shackled slave, Samson sighed,<br>
Silently scheming,<br>
Sightlessly seeking<br>
Some savage, spectacular suicide.<br>
-- Stanislaw Lem<br>
