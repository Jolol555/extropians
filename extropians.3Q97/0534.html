I really liked what Wax had to say. In an anarchy, all possibilities are<br>
allowed. I don't know why you are fixated on the idea that companies<br>
must all be owned by all of their employees. If they go into the job<br>
investing existing assets, then great, but the idea of giving one<br>
ownership for free when they start a job is dumb, not to mention<br>
economical unfeasible (people seem to wonder why the privatization of<br>
many companies in Russia has failed so badly).<br>
<p>
Employees should also have the right, as many currently do in this<br>
country, to invest whatever level they wish in the company, even $0. If<br>
they can make a better profit investing elsewhere, its their money. I'm<br>
really tired of people who think that people need to be protected from<br>
themselves. Stupidity is the last Darwinian influence on our society,<br>
lets not give that up, lest we begin to deevolve....<br>
