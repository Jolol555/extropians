<i>&gt; From: Bob Grahame &lt;bgrahame@cix.compulink.co.uk&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; How do you implement banishment if the Diaspora has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; already headed out at .99 c?</i><br>
<i>&gt; This could be a problem. It depends on the balance between the </i><br>
<i>&gt; acceleration and the reproduction. Until (or if) we approach the Omega </i><br>
<i>&gt; point then there is no real reason (that I can see) to stop and use </i><br>
<i>&gt; every atom (or solar system) we come across. If we find space is pretty </i><br>
<i>&gt; self-similar, it might pay us to expand out towards 'interesting' areas </i><br>
<i>&gt; (unusual pulsars etc.) and ignore quite a proportion of intervening </i><br>
<i>&gt; space, just leaving a few monitoring drones to 'stake our claim', if we </i><br>
<i>&gt; want to. Much of America went unclaimed until the more economically </i><br>
<i>&gt; active regions were filled out, and in an exponentially expanding sphere </i><br>
<i>&gt; this may take a *long* time to happen. Of course, if 'we' choose to </i><br>
<i>&gt; reproduce faster than we accelerate, there would be no niches left only </i><br>
<i>&gt; a few points behind the leading edge.</i><br>
<p>
	I think reproduction would expand to fill all available areas as soon as<br>
possible.  This is simply because if one entity decides to do so, there<br>
will<br>
be a lot more entities (or a lot more of that entity, growth is a type of<br>
reproduction) around that think expansion anywhere is good.<br>
	In addition, with nanotech it would be possible to transform an entire<br>
solar<br>
system to mind by leaving a seed no bigger than a cubic micron.  A bigger<br>
seed<br>
could hold even more information (or the additional information could<br>
simply<br>
be sent by the parent, who is hurtling towards those "interesting" spots at<br>
the speed of light so as to arrive at the time it was needed).<br>
	The colonization America is not a good example because human beings cannot<br>
adapt themselves to any environment nor could they reproduce without<br>
significant effort on the part of the parent, both conditions<br>
post-biological<br>
entities will not have to worry about.<br>
