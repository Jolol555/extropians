     Damien Broderick wrote regarding the film "Contact":<br>
     <br>
     I haven't seen the movie, but I do know that directors like to cut &amp; <br>
     paste.<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     Spielberg made a point in a recent interview of saying he felt totally <br>
     justified to reinterpret in a film from a book and his spin sounded <br>
     completely reasonable.  Film and books are disparate mediums where the <br>
     images in one are thrust upon you and you conjur up your own as your <br>
     read through the text of a book.  I, for one, have never been moved to <br>
     tears by a book but I know people who have and it's fascinating.  On <br>
     the other hand, a well-done Hallmark card commercial can make me gush.<br>
     <br>
     Damien?  Haven't seen Contact?  Has it not premiered down there yet?<br>
     By the way, ordered your book (my first trans-hemispheric transaction) <br>
     and looking forward to reading it.  It's my hope to get a Singularity <br>
     spin into a screenplay that has the same impact that Contact has had.  <br>
     I have another play that I'm in pre-prod on right now though.  <br>
     <br>
