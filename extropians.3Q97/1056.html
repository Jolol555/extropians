Anders Sandberg wrote about the kenes in Greg Benford’s novel _Sailing<br>
Bright Eternity_:<br>
<p>
&lt;Benford never went into any detail about it, and it was mainly an<br>
imaginative plot device and something that fit well into the theme of<br>
his pentalogy (the struggle and co-evolution of different phylums of<br>
"life"). His basic idea seems to be that once you have sufficiently<br>
rich "memospheres" where memes can thrive (like the Internet?),<br>
predatory memes can appear, some kind of meta-lebel entities which are<br>
not directly observable to the hosts of the memes (humans or<br>
computers). In fact, since they somehow *eat* memes, we can't even<br>
think or understand them. I seriously doubt that the last is possible,<br>
but it is a fun idea that there could exist beings which we are *by<br>
definition* unable to comprehend. &gt;<br>
<p>
That wasn’t really a spoiler because there’s a diagram right up front<br>
in the book that shows this hierarchy of intelligences ;-)  <br>
<p>
I’m not sure these would be predatory memes in the sense of eating.<br>
It’s probably more a situation of control levels as in cybernetics.<br>
<p>
Here are some excerpts that ARE more of a spoiler and give some flavor<br>
for the story:<br>
<p>
Benford has the 'voice' of the Syntony describe how: "a new stage<br>
deploys. Above the apparent order of the gene world, above even the<br>
drama of organisms ... the largest theater of all ... self-replicating<br>
ideas in the minds of machines . . . called kenes." <br>
<p>
I wonder, though, if 'above' is an inappropriate concept. Perhaps<br>
microbes and genes are just as ‘intelligent’ as human organisms *on<br>
their own level*. The same would hold for kenes and memes. Benford<br>
seems to somewhat recognize this when he says "all wove and lurked and<br>
had no conscious voice. They broke onto the conscious stage only with<br>
force, sudden actors in a play that no one faction wrote."  I take<br>
this to mean that they can only be conscious or act through their<br>
embodiments or instantiations.<br>
<p>
Then, showing an uncharacteristically bitter bias against humans,<br>
Benford spoils it for me by saying "A human could not do that. Could<br>
not step outside and watch itself have an idea". <br>
<p>
Hmph! I know that I have watched myself have ideas, though I certainly<br>
can’t do this with any kind of consistency or completeness. Then<br>
Benford starts ranting about "The messiahs. The fever-eyed shamans.<br>
Bastards," and how the Hunker Down was necessary "to shrug off the<br>
addictive superstitions that beset all humans in groups". <br>
<p>
I wonder, though, whether intelligence and ignorance aren’t both<br>
scalable. Where we are intelligent, Benford's so-called "Highers" know<br>
nothing, and vice versa. This culminates in the deterministic dictum<br>
of the Syntony: "Know this: All matters known to you further the<br>
affairs of the lesser levels, to our wishes. We do not negotiate. We<br>
do not dictate. We cause to happen." <br>
<p>
I think it’s possible that there is both ‘upward’ and ‘downward’<br>
causation, depending on what level you are observing.  Also, I wonder<br>
if Benford really believes this. For example, he has Nigel say to<br>
Abraham, when they seem to be floating in some kind of cyberspace<br>
being examined by the Powers: "Ignore all these onlookers. Even Gods<br>
can be just a backdrop, if we choose." <br>
<p>
The next step is to recognize that consciousness might be scalable.<br>
The Syntony can not be conscious ("all wove and lurked and had no<br>
conscious voice"), only its agents, on whatever level, can do that.<br>
And if consciousness is scalable, then we could possibly abandon our<br>
genomic bias and transform our viewpoints to any other level. <br>
<p>
As sages have said for centuries, "as above, so below".<br>
