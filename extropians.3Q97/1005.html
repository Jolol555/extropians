<p>
My concern with this idea however, is that it may have the opposite <br>
effect of which I'm intending - to destroy the sense of community I'm <br>
trying to nurture.<br>
<p>
Many people here say they respond to ideas most. For me, the *people* <br>
behind those ideas are just as important. Because the real power of this <br>
list has been the opportunity its given me to meet like-minded people <br>
with whom I can share ideas and polish my thinking.<br>
<p>
I would hate to see this list disintegrate into factions of people <br>
hiding behind excessive filters - although I sense this may already be <br>
happening to a large extent. (Or is that just my paranoia talking?)<br>
