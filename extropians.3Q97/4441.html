<i>&gt;         I have always disliked the whole idea of "left" and</i><br>
<i>&gt;         "right" in</i><br>
<i>&gt; politics (or non-politics, as it may be.)  By saying that one is</i><br>
<i>&gt; "left wing" it gives the impression that the person in question</i><br>
<i>&gt; has *only* left wing tendencies when they may possess many "right</i><br>
<i>&gt; wing" qualities as well. The Advocates for Self-Government has a</i><br>

Hitler was an outstanding example of a "left wing extremist" even<br>
though he's portrayed by the "left" today as a "right wing<br>
extremist".  Such cult-like dichotomies do nothing to further<br>
progress.<br>
<p>
It really means little in practical terms whether one is "left" <br>
or "right" in anarchy.  The "left" wouldn't survive without <br>
utilizing coercion (oxymoron!), or adapting capitalist techniques.  <br>
So by default, "right" anarchy is anarchy.<br>
<p>
"Left" anarchy is nothing more than intellectual masturbation for<br>
socialist and communist ideological refugees, particulary in the<br>
highly-statist European countries.  Along with well-intentioned<br>
"liberals" in general, they are so completely brainwashed by<br>
masochist-statist-think, not even anarchy gives the relief they<br>
desparately seek.  "Compassionate capitalism" is probably going to<br>
be the new euphorism for approximating practical anarchy in the<br>
years ahead.<br>
<p>
Karl Marx is seriously rolling in his grave confronted with the<br>
fact the Chinese Red Army controls the "means of production" by<br>
owning and investing in private corporations.  Not even the<br>
militaries depending on "democratically appropriated funding" in<br>
the West can beat that.  I think its an astute sign of the future.<br>
<p>
BTW, it's interesting that anarchy is "uptist" on that chart from<br>
A.S.E..  It probably imparts "progress" subconsciously.<br>
