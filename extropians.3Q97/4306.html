In a message dated 97-09-23 05:28:44 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I'm convinced that it is true that if you cannot explain<br>
 your field of study to an interested 10-year old, then you haven't<br>
 understood it yourself. &gt;<br>
<p>
I'll buy that...now for a question?  Suppose that  **I'm** intereted in<br>
something and an  &gt;expert&lt; in the field can't explain it to &gt;me&lt;.  There<br>
seems to be only two possibilities....either I am less capable of<br>
understanding than a 10-year old....&lt;so simple that only a child can<br>
understand it????&gt;   or that the &gt;expert&lt; is very much less of an<br>
expert...being unable to explain his subject to a college educated,...fairly<br>
widely read adult something which he SHOULD be able to explain to a child.<br>
<p>
Or am I missing something?<br>
