Wax,<br>
<p>
The things that you find wrong with home schooling are exactly the reason <br>
so many people chose to have home schooling. Lack of rebellion, the chance <br>
to impart core values and control over some to the influences that these <br>
parents fear from the education system will always provide the basis for <br>
continued interest in home schooling.<br>
<p>
However, I also know that one of our friends gave up home schooling because <br>
the kids were driving her nuts. You might say that the kids were home <br>
schooling the mom.<br>
