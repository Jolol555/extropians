Dear Associates on list extropians,<br>
<p>
Now that f-prime@activist.com (Freespeak) has launched the debate on NSPIC.<br>
NSPIC = Neuro-Semantic Political Illusion Complex, and I have had the<br>
opportunity to read the article "Deep Anarchy" by Max More, my two posts to<br>
list extropians may seem like too much, too soon, on an unrelated subject.<br>
 If that was your impression, the fault is all mine, but your impression is<br>
still mistaken.<br>

I feel his pain!  I discovered in 1953 that the principles which regulate our<br>
stable and prosperous corporations have not been applied to our political<br>
systems, and over the 44 years not even a handful of people have been able to<br>
communicate effectively about this obvious systemic defect of omission in<br>
public policy.  At the end of the day, the debate on NSPIC must converge on a<br>
SINGLE structure for an optimum society, not on a DIFFERENT structure for<br>
every mail list on the internet.<br>
<p>
Here is another post to prompt the debate,<br>

Dear Defenders of the Republic:<br>
<p>
If you are satisfied with the present trends in our world-wide laboratory of<br>
nations, then you have no need of a technically valid conceptual model<br>
(framework) of industrial society with which you can evaluate proposed<br>
approaches to global governance.  Read no further and send me your<br>
un-subscribe requests!<br>
<p>
The practical approach to sustainable global governance is to acknowledge the<br>
excessive amount of chaos created by the systemic defect of omission in our<br>
public policy, and supply the defect of omission.   This approach requires<br>
the social science community to develop and promulgate to the public a<br>
technically valid conceptual framework that comprehends the whole system of<br>
an infinite variety of sovereign corporations operating under ONE LAW in<br>
tandem (series) with the human assets of the world commonwealth.<br>
<p>
You ask: What is this "systemic defect of omission" bull shit?  It is our<br>
propensity to evade our taxes by withholding half of the public investment we<br>
should be making in our developing human assets.  That is, we babble about<br>
the importance of public education to the future of every nation, while<br>
charging the support of children in our own nation entirely to the household<br>
budget of young low income parenting families.  The immediate effect of that<br>
unavoidable, but randomly distributed, item of fixed cost is to destroy the<br>
operation of a free market for all but gay, lesbian, celibate, elderly and<br>
high income households.  Here is a defect of public policy that inflicts a<br>
financial injustice on the great majority of the population in every society<br>
in history that has ever suffered the defect.  And most of them have suffered<br>
the defect, eventually.<br>
<p>
We know this condition as the "English Disease" by its symptoms of a volatile<br>
5 to 25% unemployment rate and a perennial 2-3% inflation rate that is<br>
observed in every industrial society that allows the priestly establishment<br>
to claim part of the first Tithe in addition to the second Tithe which is<br>
their due.  Everyone knows by now that the first Tithe is for the development<br>
of the nation's most expensive and important assets, its children.  That is,<br>
5% of GNP for their education and 5% of GNP for their support.<br>
<p>
Sustainable global governance eludes our grasp because people on the Left<br>
rail at the multinational corporations and people on the Right rail at the<br>
government, while both corporations and government are essential to the<br>
general welfare of the Commonwealth.  Having been systematically educated to<br>
be ignorant of a technically valid conceptual framework which could inform<br>
their judgment, the Left and Right surrender democratic governance (that is,<br>
control and rule) to THE INVISIBLE GOVERNMENT, whose ultimate aim, as<br>
described in 1962 by author Dan Smoot, is to create a: "one-world socialist<br>
system and make the United States an official part of it."  <br>
<p>
The alternative to such a "one-world socialist system" is obviously "a<br>
one-world de-centralized system" of sovereign nation states under ONE LAW.<br>
 The ultimate promise of making a public disclosure of the theory of such a<br>
de-centralized system, is this:  Those sovereign nations that presently find<br>
their central government trending to become more powerful and expensive, but<br>
less effective, would find it possible to muster enough public support to<br>
reverse that trend by means of corrective actions that have been standard<br>
practice in corporate management since the Bank of England was founded in<br>
1600.<br>
<p>
A substantial majority of both Left and Right will, I believe, approve of<br>
that part of the FORWARD to the report of the UN Commission on Global<br>
Governance where it is written:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; "We are not proposing movement towards world government, for were we to</i><br>
travel in that direction we could find ourselves in an even less democratic<br>
world than we have--one more accommodating to power, more hospitable to<br>
hegemonic ambition, and more reinforcing of the roles of states and<br>
governments rather than the rights of people. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
It comes down to this:  the contribution of English speaking people to the<br>
emerging new world order (whatever it may turn out to be) ended with the<br>
Great Inflation of the 1970's and '80's, and will not resume until they put<br>
their own house in order.  And this they cannot do until their social<br>
scientists develop and promulgate a technically valid conceptual framework<br>
that comprehends the whole system of an infinite variety of sovereign<br>
corporations operating in tandem (series) with the human assets of the world<br>
commonwealth.  The smaller nations cannot establish a stable and prosperous<br>
new world order while the United States and the United Kingdom are still<br>
trending toward an order "more accommodating to power, more hospitable to<br>
hegemonic ambition, and more reinforcing of the roles of states and<br>
governments rather than the rights of people."  The U. K. and the U. S. still<br>
hold the balance of world wealth and power, for the short run.<br>
<p>
But, having passed their apogees of wealth and power in 1914 and 1969,<br>
respectively, the United Kingdom and the United States are LOSING GROUND with<br>
every passing day and are FREE TO CHOOSE only between restoring their moral<br>
leadership in world affairs, and, being destroyed by internal chaos as our<br>
wealth and power decline.<br>
<p>
We can get serious about this TEFLON TOPIC by asking the members of the<br>
President's 1983 Commission on Entitlements what they intended to accomplish<br>
when they established the present Social Security Payroll Tax of 15% on<br>
earned income below $63,000/year, without any exemptions for dependents, and<br>
a zero% tax rate on all income above $63,000/year?  The members of that<br>
commission that I remember are Robert J. Dole, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Allan<br>
Greenspan, and Peter G. Peterson.  <br>
<p>
As David Lawrence, late Editor of U.S. News &amp; World Report, told me in 1970:<br>
 "your TEFLON TOPIC will not be newsworthy until some prominent person<br>
addresses the topic in a public forum."  My vision of the model could be as<br>
mistaken as McNamara's vision of the Viet Nam \War, but no one has dared to<br>
say that, because a single industry application of this model was issued a<br>
U.S. Patent in 1953, and the theory of the model had been reduced to practice<br>
by American industry, Germany, Japan, and the Scandinavian countries in the<br>
1940's.  If you have seen one such system with only one class of ACTIVE<br>
productive assets and an infinite variety of PASSIVE productive assets, you<br>
have seen them all.  <br>
<p>
I wonder who will be the first prominent American to address the topic since<br>
Henry Carter Adams last addressed it in his 1887 essay, RELATION OF THE STATE<br>
TO INDUSTRIAL ACTION?  Such a bold address will open the floodgate of public<br>
debate!<br>
