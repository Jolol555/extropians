<p>
This sounds like what has been called 'astral travelling'.  Check out a<br>
book by Susan Blakemore (?) (I think it might be called 'Out of the<br>
Body') on the subject. She's a good scientist who had this kind of<br>
experience, and investigated it, taking in turn all theories about it<br>
<i>&gt;from the wooliest magical ones to the most rigorous scientific, and</i><br>
weighing up their pros and cons. The magical theories say the 'astral<br>
realm' is genuinely independent, like physical reality, and kind of<br>
connected with it, but there's no good evidence for this yet.<br>
<p>
I would be interested if anybody else has some up to the minute research<br>
info. on this.  The phrase 'eidetic imaging' makes it sound like there's<br>
a new branch of knowledge opening up, coming at the thing from a<br>
cognitive psych angle.<br>
<p>
'Astral travelling' (which is probably the same thing as 'lucid dreaming',<br>
but while awake) has been practiced extensively in the Western occult<br>
tradition, less extensively in Eastern traditions (except the Tibetan<br>
Buddhist, which has a whole branch of yoga devoted to it).  <br>
<p>
It's conceivable that there may be some therapeutic value in the process<br>
- it's like, you 'travel' through the 'realm' of your own personal<br>
symbolism, which is grounded in your personal (perhaps also social/memetic)<br>
history and your deepest desires (or society's/the species'), which you<br>
engage in 'dialogue' in personified forms ('archetypes'?)<br>
<p>
It's interesting that the reverse of this (external reality seeming to<br>
be internal) is also a logical possibility - perhaps some forms of<br>
schizophrenia and/or autism?<br>
