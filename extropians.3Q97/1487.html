<i>&gt; Thanks, these are the kinds of things I think the future is going to be</i><br>

<i>&gt; matter the only thing left is the imagination.</i><br>

Indeed, in one of some my mad menthal researches (not that all <br>
are like these, at the opposite, but these help a lot to <br>
separate from the local spatial-temporal knowledge, and, sometimes, <br>
discover something "unseen"...) I thought that since our brains are <br>
nothing more than a molecular agglomerate ( as I've already said <br>
somewhere...) and, consequently,  a matter agglomerate interacting <br>
something very near, such brain is processing nothing more nothing <br>
less than a certain quantity of the possible physical interactions <br>
between particles of such matter ( obvious...). The mere "feeling" <br>
(detecting) of such interaction already would mean (in a certain <br>
level) a knowledge experience of any of such happening interactions. <br>
So we already "know" them inside ourselves and are simply translating <br>
them to, f.ex., a math/phys language...(higher levels of <br>
knowlegde...) <br>
And why wouldn't we have already  the possibility of "controlling the <br>
matter" as mentioned dear Danny... and do not know how to do it...<br>
Matter dealing with the same matter....with a control-processing <br>
global function (the brain + other sensors...) and possibility of <br>
concluding about itself...    <br>
<p>
A thing  litterally to think...<br>
<p>
PS: About the lainguistic mistakes, as I'm not an english language <br>
country citizen, I ask you to forgve me (Except some that I do not <br>
remember... I will possibly agree with the English Education <br>
Ministry - or something like that - which said that the "palmer"in <br>
useful  with some school boys (or if one behave as if were...)) <br>
