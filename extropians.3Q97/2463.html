In a message dated 97-08-24 17:43:48 EDT, you write: <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; Which (if any) of the creatures you know of can survive long term in a <br>
 very high vacuum (say, under 10^-9 torr) at 3 degrees kelvin?  Presumably, <br>
 most all water would be gone. &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
That just preserves the spores BETTER.  Low water activity in the case of<br>
spore survival is an advantage.  For instance vacuum freeze drying is the<br>
best method currently available for keeping spores alive. (Just add water and<br>
nutrients to revive them).   Suboptimal water activity will stop or slow<br>
growth and can make some on-spore forms of bacteria _more_ susceptible to<br>
other hostile conditions.  You can look in the book _Preservative-Free and<br>
Self-Preserving Cosmetics and Drugs_ (see below) the for which ones are<br>
affected. <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; Of course, things might hide inside a rock <br>
 for much longer, with the pressure being much higher. &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
Vacuum is not considered to be a problem for for bacteria.  For instance,<br>
vacuum packed meat is vulnerable to _Clostridium botulinum_ (another spore<br>
former, BTW) growth and botulism toxin formation. <br>
 <br>
Pressure is also not a problem for bacteria.  I personally found no bacterial<br>
reduction at 65,000 psig (the highest my system would go).  Later, I read<br>
120,000 psig also had no reduction in viability. <br>
  <br>
 &lt;&lt;Do you know of any books or papers specifically discussing the survival of<br>
 <br>
 organisms over extremely long time-spans? <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt; </i><br>
 <br>
There are some really good books on microbiology in extreme environments.<br>
 Start by searching key words "extreme environments," "extremeophiles," and<br>
looking at <a href="http://asmusa.org">http://asmusa.org</a>   <br>
You will need a university library, but look at _Applied and Environmental<br>
Microbiology_  a journal,  and the general text: _Microbiology_ by Prescott,<br>
Harley and Klein.   <br>
