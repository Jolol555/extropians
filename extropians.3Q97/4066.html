Years ago I worked on videogame development (Mattel Intellivision),<br>
and for a proposed (but later cancelled) extension we were creating<br>
musical themes.  I worked with a very creative musician, Robert Randalls,<br>
who was eager to push the limits of the sound chip.  He put in funny<br>
sound effects in some of the music, but for one piece he experimented<br>
with a different scale, which he had read about but never had a chance<br>
to try.<br>
<p>
The normal scale has full steps, like from C to D, and half steps, from<br>
C to C# to D.  The scale Randalls wanted to use had C# be different<br>
from Db, so that you had equal steps from C to C# to Db to D.  I think<br>
there was also a single step between E and F and between B and C.<br>
This divided the octave into 18 equal steps rather than the usual 12.<br>
Most of the white notes came out to be about the same.<br>
<p>
It was just as easy to program the sound generator to use these<br>
frequencies as the standard ones, of course, and Randalls had a great<br>
time playing with the altered scale.  We ended up using only one piece<br>
like this. It had a lot of runs in it, since that showed off the special<br>
charactersistics in an intriguing way.  It sounded good.<br>
<p>
So realize that the standard 12 tone scale isn't the only one possible.<br>
