<p>
The laws of physics are by definition unlikely to change, although if<br>
you can build basement universes the constants and symmetry breakings<br>
might be different ("Well, I have always thought having 2-dimensional<br>
time is a bit gauché").<br>
<p>
If there are limitations (which conservation laws seem to imply),<br>
then there will likely exist scarcities, and economics of some kind<br>
may apply. For example, in a rapidly growing technosphere<br>
reproduction can be exponential but the amount of resources grows as<br>
t^2. <br>
<p>
Memes are likely to remain, possibly in new forms. Replicating<br>
information patterns seem to be the lifeblood of the singularity, so<br>
they will definitely prosper. Whenever there is dense communications<br>
and host systems they will have the opportunity to grow. Possibly new<br>
levels of complexity can appear (like the 'kemes' mentioned in<br>
_Sailing Bright Eternity_ by Gregory Benford: predatory<br>
intelligent memes). <br>

<p>
Yes. One could imagine a pluralist singularity, where diversity grows<br>
exponentially as previous memes are amplified, mutated and selected<br>
faster, or an uniform singularity where somebody actually succeeds in<br>
becoming a SI and turning the solar system into food. In the later<br>
(and partially the former) case the memes and values present will set<br>
the future course. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The consequences of the Singularity depend on what is done with</i><br>

<p>
Values. <br>
