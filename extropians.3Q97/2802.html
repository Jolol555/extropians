<i>&gt;  &gt; Tolerance is an obligation /only/ of listeners, not speakers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think this overstates things a bit; I certainly feel no obligation</i><br>
<i>&gt; to tolerate anything anyone cares to say to me.  If someone is</i><br>
<i>&gt; spewing offensive speech at me, I have zero obligation to listen</i><br>
<i>&gt; to it: I'll get right up and walk away without a shred of remorse.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (It's called plonking.)  If tolerance is an obligation at all, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is an obligation of human beings regardless of their speaking or</i><br>
<i>&gt; listening roles.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps it is a simplification.  The kind of "tolerance" I mean is<br>
that you not only must refrain from punching him in the nose for his<br>
choice of speech (an obligation, you correctly point out, of all<br>
speakers and listeners), but that you further should not allow the<br>
offensive style of speech, or one's perceived motives of the<br>
speaker, or one's personal opinion of things or people outside the<br>
explicit meaning of the speech itself, to cloud one's judgment of<br>
the value of the ideas, and most importantly, to influence the<br>
availability of the ideas to others.  One is free to use speech to<br>
label another speaker a crackpot, but if one goes beyond that and<br>
tries to silence unpopular speech, or judge the ideas of speech<br>
based on the speaker's other beliefs, then one is being an intolerant<br>
(and thereby ineffective) listener. <br>
<p>
I do have mixed feelings about plonking individuals; even those<br>
with whom I constantly disagree or share no interest I generally<br>
read cursorily on the chance that an interesting idea may pop up.<br>
After many years on the net without a kill-file of any kind, I must<br>
admit that I now use them.  I block spam to my site when I can,<br>
and I have two people whose postings I kill.  These latter two<br>
decisions were difficult for me, and I only undertook them with<br>
serious consideration.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; The obligations of a speaker are clarity and honesty above all else.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, but a clear and honest speaker who fails to communicate with </i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone because he drives away his target audience with implicit</i><br>
<i>&gt; insults before they've really listened to his message isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; accomplishing much.  I don't think there's anything particularly</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropic about futile and self-defeating activity.</i><br>
<p>
True enough, but if you only piss off a few intolerant listeners<br>
as a fair price for better communication to the rest, it may be a<br>
good bargain.<br>
<p>
[For recent list members, Eric and I have had this particular<br>
discussion before, and you will find it in the archives (I think<br>
the thread title was "Plea")]<br>
