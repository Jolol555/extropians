While this has been a problem in the past, I look forward to a day when<br>
even this social convention can be avoided.  Uploadable intelligence makes<br>
the problem of killing the body, at worst, an inconvenience.  Government<br>
itself will become a lost cause ... what punishment can be dealt on the<br>
uploadable (replicable) brain?  What force can hold it in place?  What<br>
agency can permanently remove an article of information from this world?<br>
&lt;/opinion&gt;<br>

John Stuart Mill argues that man is essentially striving for happiness;<br>
that society should therefore strive for the happiness of those within it.<br>
But what happens to the utilitarian society when man arrives at the point<br>
to which he has been striving, when he reaches happiness at the throw of a<br>
switch?  Society falls apart; man himself becomes functionless.<br>
<p>
What kind of society is left?<br>
&lt;/opinion&gt;<br>
