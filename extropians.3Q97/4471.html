My point is that anything as blatantly anti-survival as<br>
stand-still-and-be-eaten cannot be part of our instinctive make-up. Any such<br>
notion would be very quickly eliminated from the gene pool. Therefore,<br>
defense-is-not-wrong *must* be a human instinct.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In fact, the whole</i><br>

<i>&gt;that defense against aggression is not 'wrong', and it is moral to defend</i><br>
<i>&gt;against aggression. </i><br>
<p>
Why do you believe defense against aggression is moral? Why not amoral?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now, define "aggression".</i><br>
<p>
It is not the purpose of the primethic decision to define defense or<br>
aggression, but rather to identify the real world phenomenon that<br>
establishes the basis of both rights and morality. IOW, where do these<br>
concepts come from?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Still, this could mean that defense is either moral or amoral. In non-human</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;context, we would probably deem defense to be *amoral*. In human context,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;however, it is in the interests of the vast majority to make a personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;moral choice to the effect that proportionate defense against aggression is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;*moral* and thus aggressive behavior which elicits a defensive response is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;*immoral*.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are you saying that people can pick and choose? </i><br>
<p>
I am saying that people *do* pick and choose.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If so, who is to say that</i><br>
<i>&gt;one choice is 'moral' while another choice is 'immoral'. What defines 'moral'?</i><br>
<p>
Defense cannot instinctively be immoral. The choices are *moral* or<br>
*amoral*. The decision that proportionate defense is moral, and aggression<br>
is immoral, is what defines 'moral'. The decision that defense is not just<br>
something we do (amoral), but rather something that is right to do (moral),<br>
is the very basis of morality and rights.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I call this choice the "primethic" decision.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I guess you can call it whatever you like, but what exactly does</i><br>
<i>&gt;'primethic' mean? </i><br>
<p>
It means making the primary ethical decision that proportionate defense<br>
against aggression is moral and aggression is immoral. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;The primethic decision establishes the basis for both "rights" and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"morality" since to deem defense against aggression, in the human context,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to be *amoral* is to deny the *existance* of both rights and morality.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Defense against aggression is moral, by definition. What definition of</i><br>
<i>&gt;"aggression" are you using that would lead to the mistaken notion that</i><br>
<i>&gt;defense against aggression might somehow possibly be 'amoral'?</i><br>
<p>
Where does the *concept* of morality come from if not the primethic<br>
decision? A definition must ultimately connect to a real world phenomenon,<br>
or it is meaningless. Why, when we view a dispute between humans, do we<br>
judge who is *right* and who is *wrong*? Do *all* people do this, or just<br>
those who have made the primethic decision?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; If</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;defense against aggression is amoral...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It isn't, ever.</i><br>
<p>
Why?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; ... then aggression which elicits a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;defensive response must necessarily be amoral.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It isn't, ever.</i><br>
<p>
Why?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The personal moral choice to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;be made, then, is *rights/morality* or *no-rights/amorality*.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How so?</i><br>
<p>
There can be no concepts of morality or rights without first believing that<br>
defense against aggression is moral, and aggression is immoral.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;If these, in fact, are the only two choices, then my proportionate defense</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;against aggression is, from my point of view, moral, and from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;aggressor's point of view, either moral or amoral. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Aggression, by definition, is immoral. A rights violation. </i><br>
<p>
What real world phenomenon forms the basis of your definition?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Either way, such defense</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;*imposes* nothing on the aggressor. That is to say, proportionate defense is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;not, even from the aggressor's point of view, an immoral aggression.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Probably true, but your argument is weak and does not support your conclusion.</i><br>
<p>
Where do the concepts of *rights* and *morality* come from? Where do your<br>
definitions come from?<br>
