<i>        &gt;black whole tear the intrepid astronaut to bits?</i><br>
               <br>
If no force is acting on the astronaut except gravity, that is, if he's <br>
freely falling, then ever particle in the poor man is moving in parallel <br>
straight lines, or rather the analog of parallel straight lines when you're <br>
dealing with curved surfaces, a geodesic. 4 dimensional spacetime can be <br>
thought of as the surface of a 5 dimensional sphere, but that can't really be <br>
visualized so consider the 2 dimensional surface of a 3 dimensional sphere, <br>
like the earth.<br>
   <br>
If I'm on the equator and want to go to the north pole by the shortest route <br>
then there is only one path I can follow, a geodesic. Suppose I have company <br>
on my trip because my neighbor, also on the equator 10 miles west of me, <br>
is going to the pole by the shortest route too. Both out paths are absolutely<br>
perpendicular to the equator and at first, when we've only gone a short <br>
distance, my path and that of my neighbor seem absolutely parallel too, but <br>
as we continue our journey we start to get closer together until at the pole <br>
we collide. There was no force pushing us together, it's just what happens <br>
when 2 people follow a geodesic on a sphere. Even if we were 2  dimensional <br>
creatures incapable of visualizing the third dimension we could still deduce <br>
that the ground must be curved in that mysterious direction because we find <br>
that parallel straight lines converge if they're long enough, if fact that's<br>
what is mente by a surface being curved.<br>
   <br>
At fist our astronaut feels no force as he falls into the central point of <br>
the black hole, the singularity, because all his parts are moving straight <br>
and parallel, and if space was flat things would stay that way, but it's <br>
curved and the curve is increasing. Despite moving in parallel his parts are<br>
nevertheless getting closes together and will continue to do so until every <br>
particle in his body occupies exactly the same point in spacetime, he'd be <br>
crushed to death long before that of course.<br>
                            <br>

<i>        &gt;When space-time distorts, as I understand it, 'new' space-time is        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;not created, existing space-time merely stretches. But it stretches        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;only in the context of an external point of view. Anything within        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that space-time would not see the stretching</i><br>
                            <br>
<p>
If our astronaut was the size of a mathematical point then he would feel no <br>
force and have no problem, but he's so big that his head and feet are in <br>
VERY different reference frames, and that's not healthy for our poor friend.<br>
