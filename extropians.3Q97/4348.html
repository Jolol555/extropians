<i>&gt; "The untrained man reads a paper on natural science and thinks:</i><br>

I'm hardly an untrained man, and I when I refer to complex terminology,<br>
I don't mean long words derived from latin syllables. Those I can figure<br>
out rather easily. Its acronyms and "in" terms that seem to be only<br>
known by specialists in the field, which seems to reinforce that<br>
exclusivity. I'm not alone in this. I've seen several articles in<br>
prestigious science journals write similar complaints in the last year.<br>
<p>
This phenomenon is not just part of science publishing. While studying<br>
mechanical engineering at WPI, I noticed that there were texts that were<br>
educating and informative, and texts that had the same sort of elitist<br>
nomenclature that acted more to filter people out of fields than bring<br>
them in by educating them. I also noticed that these two types of texts<br>
were used by professors that behaved on a similarly polar scale toward<br>
students in the classes they taught.<br>
