Certainly not.  What I think might more properly be assumed is that people<br>
are hired to do jobs and that so long as they do them satisfactorily they<br>
may reasonably expect that their employment is secure, all other things<br>
being equal. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Interesting idea to contractually</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Part of my point was to suggest that contracts always rely for their<br>
intelligibility and force on a welter of unstated assumptions. The very<br>
idea of the contract which *specifies* every exigency in advance is a<br>
fantasy.  I wondered whether or not the idea that people are hired for<br>
jobs in respect of their capacity to perform them rather than their<br>
capacity to exemplify unfashionable kinds of humans is among these<br>
unstated assumptions.  It seems to be -- at least among many of the<br>
unpleasantly surprised employees who find themselves abruptly unemployed<br>
after employers discover, e.g., that they are gay.  Btw, in most of the<br>
United States the "Equal Opportunity Employer" designation does *not*<br>
protect lesbians and gays.  The whole thrust of the suggestion that we<br>
treat discrimination as breach of contract was to divert the easy<br>
interpretation that unpopular minorties seeking protections want something<br>
for nothing (say, the outward appearance of a tolerant world secured at<br>
governmental gunpoint), to a more congenial interpretation that would<br>
accuse the racist, sexist, heterosexist, or whatever employer of trying to<br>
have his cake and eat it too (say, wanting to profit from the existence of<br>
a particular sociocultural regime of civility while selectively refusing<br>
some of its central stipulations).  Best, Dale<br>
