Anton Sherwood:<br>
: &gt; Would you kill someone for saying, "My thoughts are the only<br>
: &gt; privacy I have left; they are not for you" ?<br>
<p>
(M.L. addressed my _next_ question at length but didn't touch this one.)<br>
<p>
     [...]<br>
: &gt; (see also the parole hearing in _The Shawshank Redemption_)<br>
<p>
Mike Lorrey:<br>
: I've seen it. As I recall, the guy who escaped was innocent.  [...]<br>
<p>
I refer to Morgan Freeman's character's parole hearing,<br>
at which he said something like "You know and I know<br>
that this is all baloney, so just stamp your little papers<br>
and let me get back to my cell."<br>
