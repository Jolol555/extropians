Dear EvMick and other fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
Possibly, among the main delights of being married to a very understanding<br>
and loving elementary school teacher are the dialogues we engage in on how<br>
to teach grades one through five to engage in critical reasoning and make<br>
value judgements..<br>
<p>
It's not so much in explaining something to a 10 year old, it's getting<br>
them to fully understand what you are explaining and teaching and being<br>
able to build in their own minds on what they have learned. At the heart<br>
of this transmital of understanding is developing in each child the<br>
knowledge, skill and ability to share the knowledge (and hopefully the<br>
wisdom) inherent in the knowledge they have accumulated. <br>
<p>
We have all accumulated some information in our lifetimes. Does that<br>
information develop into knowledge that we can share, and thereby use to<br>
help increase the sum total of human understanding?    <br>
<p>
Is this what understanding should and can be?<br>

In a message dated 97-09-23 05:28:44 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I'm convinced that it is true that if you cannot explain<br>
 your field of study to an interested 10-year old, then you haven't<br>
 understood it yourself. &gt;<br>
<p>
I'll buy that...now for a question?  Suppose that  **I'm** intereted in<br>
something and an  &gt;expert&lt; in the field can't explain it to &gt;me&lt;.  There<br>
seems to be only two possibilities....either I am less capable of<br>
understanding than a 10-year old....&lt;so simple that only a child can<br>
understand it????&gt;   or that the &gt;expert&lt; is very much less of an<br>
expert...being unable to explain his subject to a college<br>
educated,...fairly<br>
widely read adult something which he SHOULD be able to explain to a child.<br>
<p>
Or am I missing something?<br>
