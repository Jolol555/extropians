[Andrea decides to see if there's a useful conversation in this thread,<br>
before Perry explodes upon realizing that this is someone who helps write<br>
"consumer protection" laws for New York.]<br>

I suspect this is true, and that is part of the problem that so many on<br>
this list have with these regulations.  Why don't we take the IRS rules<br>
about contractors as one example?  You said to Perry that we could<br>
comfortably expect these regulations to adapt to suit organizations as they<br>
change.  In fact, the IRS tightened the rules for when you can call someone<br>
a contractor just as many companies have started to use contracting<br>
heavily.  I have been asked by firms, for whom I believed I was clearly<br>
contracting, if I would please sign on as a temporary employee just to<br>
avoid IRS issues.<br>
<p>
If contract relationships are the wave of the future, why is the IRS making<br>
it so difficult to operate this way?  It's relatively easy to explain if<br>
you take a public choice approach and assume that the IRS wants to maximize<br>
it's revenue and power with little regard to the effect on the economy.<br>
How would you interpret the situation?<br>
<p>
