So could the leading lab. And it would be more attractive to <br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You're changed scenarios again!  First it was destructive gray goo</i><br>

<p>
We are trying to discuss several scenarios at once on this thread, <br>
that's why it seems like some suspect rethoric maneuver is taking <br>
place. The nihilit fanatic is only dangerous if nanotech becomes <br>
everyman's tool, as Ander's said he think it will. But before <br>
that happens, we have to look at what the big, leading institutions <br>
would do with it.<br>
