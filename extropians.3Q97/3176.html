Dear Sunah and other fellow Extropians:<br>
<i>&gt;From what I've read, and from my discussions with people who are far more</i><br>
familiar with the complexities of human behavior than I am, what you seem<br>
to be complaining about is nothing more than your frustration in dealing<br>
with your perception of  our many human inadequacies. <br>
We sometimes feel frustrated because we have not yet found a way of<br>
expressing ourselves in a manner that some of our contemporaries can<br>
understand. <br>
Essentially, we may be annoyed at our own limitations as much as, or more<br>
than, what we perceive to be the the intellectual, emotional, educational,<br>
social or cultural limitations of others. Our initial reaction to this<br>
frustration is frequently anger. If we are capable of understanding the<br>
roots of this emotional response and can transcend our emotions and<br>
achieve reason and logic, our cognitive skills will, hopefully, take the<br>
forefront and help us achieve wisdom.<br>
I suspect that to some degree we all want to evolve beyond our present<br>
limitations and our frustrations. <br>
Is that not a purpose of the Extropian philosophy?<br>

OK, here's the thing. There is one big thing that is happening around me<br>
all the time that I just don't relate to. Why do people get pissed off at<br>
other people for being stupid or illogical or wrong? I can see, if you<br>
like<br>
them, wanting to help them out, or if you have a pet theory they disagree<br>
with wanting to take your theory out for a spin, or if they are hurting<br>
your business, suing them, but I just can't see being upset about other<br>
people's opinions. Does anyone want to explain this?<br>
