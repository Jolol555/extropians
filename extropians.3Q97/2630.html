Someone was kind enough to point out to me that AMG recently wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;....Harry Truman.</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;....was the last real human being in the White House. </i><br>
<p>
There, you may be right; although I'd count Eisenhower too. Not on<br>
humanitarian/mensch grounds, but on the grounds of being someone who was at<br>
least slightly inclined to actually speak his mind. Harry was a relatively<br>
plain-spoken man, Ike somewhat less so; "after them, the deluge"--image<br>
became all, and shortly thereafter the old party system, warts and all, but<br>
where roughly twenty thousand people who cared enough to wade through all<br>
the cigar smoke could actually pick a candidate (and expected to be told by<br>
him what he stood for), transmogrified into the toad-on-steroids<br>
PAC-representation scheme we are currently saddled with. Since somewhere in<br>
the Nixon years, there is zero reason to keep one's promises to anyone _but<br>
the people who paid_ to see you elected--the very thing the law(s?) that<br>
caused PACs was(/were?) supposed to keep from happening. Quel ironee.<br>
<p>
The other thing I keep in mind is that Harry was president for the last (in<br>
the sense of "most recent"--_vide_ "The Fourth Turning") time the US<br>
culture had as subtext "we're all in this together". I had a dream the<br>
other night which was set in that time. At one point during the dream, I<br>
made a point of thanking someone for doing something, then realized they<br>
were looking at me funny because _they weren't doing it for me, they were<br>
doing it because it was the patriotic thing to do, and we should both<br>
already know that..._, and I wondered if they'd spotted me as being from a<br>
"foreign culture" and were going to report me as a possible spy. <br>
<p>
I was actually seriously worried about the gaffe. Then I woke up.<br>
<p>
ObExtroContent:<br>
If _The Fourth Turning_ has any merit, this might become a cultural<br>
commonplace again. Has anyone here given any thought to the tradeoffs<br>
involved in surviving/thriving in such a time?<br>
