These are indeed both excellent graphic novels, some of the best in<br>
the field. <br>
<p>
But I think you'll find that those who wrote them (Alan Moore, David<br>
Gibbons, and the Scotsman whose name I've forgotten who writes the<br>
'Invisibles', another more recent good comic) are pretty solidly<br>
left-wing.  Not stupid, knee-jerk lefties, mind you, (I mean, I have no<br>
doubt that they've probably given libertarian and extropian ideas some<br>
serious consideration) but leftists nonetheless - I'm pretty sure of this<br>
because they come from the 2000AD stable, which was a*very* left-oriented<br>
UK comic all through the 80s, and had a few offshoots (e.g. a comic<br>
called 'Crisis') which were as red as they come.  So unless they've<br>
changed an*awful* lot since then ...<br>
