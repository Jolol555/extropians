<i>&gt;I heard that science cured a blind person (he was blind since birth) but when</i><br>
<i>&gt;they cured him he freaked out and couldnt handle it.  It was a total new</i><br>
<i>&gt;dimension to his consciousness, you have to prepare for that spiritually.</i><br>

Actually, you may be thinking of the woman whose hearing was cured.  <br>
An amazing theatrical play was recently produced about her life, and <br>
I heard an interview with some of the doctors and the actress who <br>
portrayed her.  A riveting hour of conversation (so few of those on <br>
the airwaves nowadays!) that touched on many transhumanist themes.<br>
