<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Virtually all human beings would instinctively agree that defense against</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;instinct, i.e. defense is immoral, would be anti-survival.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Lots of things that are moral can be anti-survival. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;My point is that anything as blatantly anti-survival as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;stand-still-and-be-eaten cannot be part of our instinctive make-up. Any such</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;notion would be very quickly eliminated from the gene pool. Therefore,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;defense-is-not-wrong *must* be a human instinct.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Strictly as an empirical observation, Gary's idea seems to be true of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;overwhelming majority of people.  Only outright pacifists believe defense is</i><br>
<i>&gt;immoral.</i><br>
<p>
Even this (pacifism) can only be learned behavior, not instinctive, and can<br>
only be an effective strategy in the assumption that the vast majority of<br>
others have, in fact, made the primethic decision.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;In fact, the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;point of morals is to create rules that people will follow even in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;situations where it is not in their immediate interest to do so. In extreme</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;circumstance, it's possible that death might result. Consequently, I agree</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;that defense against aggression is not 'wrong', and it is moral to defend</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;against aggression. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Why do you believe defense against aggression is moral? Why not amoral?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Now, define "aggression".</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;It is not the purpose of the primethic decision to define defense or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;aggression, but rather to identify the real world phenomenon that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;establishes the basis of both rights and morality. IOW, where do these</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;concepts come from?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You ought to know that Ken DEFINES aggression as a rights-violation, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;rights as agreements.  Real-world actions are not relevant to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;definition.  Specifically, Ken has stated that if A bops B on the nose, this</i><br>
<i>&gt;is only aggression if A defines it as such.  Therefore, no observer can ever</i><br>
<i>&gt;'see' aggression.  The victim would have to show that at the time that A</i><br>
<i>&gt;bopped B that A 'agreed' that bopping is wrong.  THEN it would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;aggression.  But in another related thread Ken has also agreed with Bernard</i><br>
<i>&gt;Curry who stated that anyone can unilaterally void an agreement at any time,</i><br>
<i>&gt;if there is no perceived 'net benefit'.  Voiding rights agreements voids the</i><br>
<i>&gt;possibility of aggression.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Therefore it is a very good bet that aggression hardly ever exists.  Most</i><br>
<i>&gt;occasions that LOOK LIKE aggression are simply cases of unilaterally voided</i><br>
<i>&gt;non-aggression agreements.  Of course, most people who don't abide by an</i><br>
<i>&gt;agreement have darn good reasons (to them, at the time).  Most will give you</i><br>
<i>&gt;some reason why the agreement shouldn't really 'apply', or that the action</i><br>
<i>&gt;should be permitted as an 'exception', or should be part of an 'escape</i><br>
<i>&gt;clause', or was an unfortunate 'necessity'.</i><br>
<p>
Why don't we let Ken speak for himself?<br>
<p>
If *you* want to say that rights are by agreement, then where does agreement<br>
come from? Ultimately, there must be a real world connection, or the very<br>
concept would not exist, and we wouldn't be having this discussion.<br>
<p>
The concept of agreement, or more specifically, consent, is clearly implied<br>
by the primethic decision. If defense is not moral, and aggression is not<br>
immoral, then consent is meaningless. By deciding that defense is moral, and<br>
aggression is immoral, we claim a right to consent for ourselves, and<br>
unilaterally offer a reciprocol, and equal, right to all others.<br>
<p>
The all-important question is not whether the primethic exists, but whether<br>
it is instinctively shared by all, or a decision is made along the way. The<br>
fact that it *exists*, either way, lays the groundwork for rights, morality,<br>
and subsequent agreements (consent).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Still, this could mean that defense is either moral or amoral. In non-human</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;context, we would probably deem defense to be *amoral*. In human context,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;however, it is in the interests of the vast majority to make a personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;moral choice to the effect that proportionate defense against aggression is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*moral* and thus aggressive behavior which elicits a defensive response is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*immoral*.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The primethic decision establishes the basis for both "rights" and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"morality" since to deem defense against aggression, in the human context,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to be *amoral* is to deny the *existance* of both rights and morality.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Defense against aggression is moral, by definition. What definition of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;"aggression" are you using that would lead to the mistaken notion that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;defense against aggression might somehow possibly be 'amoral'?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Where does the *concept* of morality come from if not the primethic</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;decision? A definition must ultimately connect to a real world phenomenon,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;or it is meaningless. Why, when we view a dispute between humans, do we</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;judge who is *right* and who is *wrong*? Do *all* people do this, or just</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;those who have made the primethic decision?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If we are libertarian, we judge by their agreement.  Of course, with Ken's</i><br>
<i>&gt;new thoughts about voided agreements, I'm not sure it will ever matter.</i><br>
<i>&gt;After all, if one can unilaterally void agreements, one can void rights</i><br>
<i>&gt;agreements with penalty clauses, too.  Perhaps it is more libertarian to</i><br>
<i>&gt;simply ask everyone what should be done with them.  "Mr. Capone, you are</i><br>
<i>&gt;charged with assault and murder, and we are inclined to agree with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;complaint.  Now, what punishment do you wish?  And will it be cash or charge?"</i><br>
<p>
Let's wait and see what Ken has to say.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If these, in fact, are the only two choices, then my proportionate defense</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;against aggression is, from my point of view, moral, and from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;aggressor's point of view, either moral or amoral. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Aggression, by definition, is immoral. A rights violation. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;What real world phenomenon forms the basis of your definition?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Not required.  Definitions are the building block of the system.  We are</i><br>
<i>&gt;entitled to make them up.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, we make them up to describe...what?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Either way, such defense</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*imposes* nothing on the aggressor. That is to say, proportionate defense is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not, even from the aggressor's point of view, an immoral aggression.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Probably true, but your argument is weak and does not support your</i><br>
conclusion.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Where do the concepts of *rights* and *morality* come from? Where do your</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;definitions come from?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why, assertion, of course.</i><br>
<p>
Assertions concerning...what?<br>
