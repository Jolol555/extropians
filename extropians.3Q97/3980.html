<i>&gt; Yes, the power to print currency is reserved to the Fed in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Constitution. But one must ask, "Why?" </i><br>
<p>
There is intentionally no provision for printing "legal tender" in<br>
the so-called Constitution, only coining "lawful money".  That the <br>
private Federal Reserve managed to defraud the Congress for a power <br>
it did not possess, confiscate gold from the American people, make <br>
debt liabilities the only "legal" medium of exchange, et al. is <br>
merely in keeping in line with the intentions of the malevolent <br>
powers behind it.  Recall what the so-called 14th Amendment states:<br>
<p>
"The validity of the public debt ... shall not be questioned."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Clearly, allowing local scrips is inflationary. Or, at the very </i><br>
<i>&gt; least, creates money where money would not have been. This is of </i><br>
<i>&gt; course very, very bad for central fiscal policy. No matter what </i><br>
<i>&gt; the Fed does to reduce inflation, anyone with poker chips (or the </i><br>
<i>&gt; capacity to make poker chips) may add to the money supply at will.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In short, I'm not surprised they hate new currencies.</i><br>
<p>
Ithaca Hours in Ithaca, New York, which is a very successful scrip <br>
that has been cloned worldwide, closely matches the issuance of new<br>
scrip with actual labor/goods produced in the community.  Thus,<br>
inflation is nonexistent.  This is no threat to the Fed/IRS since<br>
it helps offset the currency inflation (since any gain in Hours<br>
terms is "required" to be included as a tax liability.)<br>
<p>
The Fed has more than a monoply on just printing currency for its<br>
reason to fear true competitors.  It rakes in nearly infinite<br>
profits by devaluing it before it's placed into circulation.  <br>
<p>
On a central bank level, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is solely<br>
unique among the world's central banks in that it does not have the<br>
ability to print currency at all.  (The Hong Kong Dollar is pegged <br>
to the U.S. Dollar however).  Hopefully, the Chinese terrorcrats <br>
will see fit to leave it alone.<br>
