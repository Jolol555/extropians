<i>&gt; I have been a subscriber to Extropy since issue #4.  Despite a </i><br>

<p>
So using people is not so bad after all...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; BUT:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropianism has as its basic tenet the goal of surpassing all limits</i><br>
<i>&gt; to our freedom.  But as extropians rush to shed the tryannies of</i><br>
<i>&gt; government, authority, death and taxes they rush to embrace the blind tyranny</i><br>
<i>&gt; of evolution and the free-market.  You have accepted the slavery of</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural selection and market pressures to get ajob.  the extropian tyrannical</i><br>
<i>&gt; maxim is: Evolve or die!</i><br>
<p>
If natural selection is as tyrannical as government, authority, death<br>
and taxes, and as adverse to freedom, why would any extropian<br>
transhumanist rush to embrace it?  <br>
<p>
You have done very little homework on this one. <br>
<p>
Have you ever encountered, in you two-year sojourn through extropian<br>
culture, the term "autoevolution?"<br>
<p>
Perhaps not.<br>
<p>
While I cannot speak for extropians in general, my personal transhuman<br>
goals tend to eviscerate biological fundamentalism. I don't want to be a<br>
slave to natural selection any more than you do. What do you think about<br>
autoevolution? Why cannnot humanity, with enough information and<br>
technology, eventually control and/or guide its own evolution apart from<br>
natural selection? I'd appreciate a cogent argument.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; Please witness the following posts made in</i><br>

<i>&gt; I worry about the people who are completely excluded in participating</i><br>
<i>&gt; in our economy by drug laws, sub-standard education, and welfare traps.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Fix those problems and I bet we could handle your hard cases.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Me: Who said the solution is geting these people back to work?  I want</i><br>
<i>&gt; to eliminate mandatory work altogether.  Prosperity w/o drudgery is my</i><br>
<i>&gt; goal!  Pass the joint!</i><br>
<p>
Wait, now. You like RAW's RICH economy, but you don't like putting<br>
people out of work with robotics? Are you trying to be inscrutable on<br>
purpose? I read _Schroedinger's Cat_ and _Right Where You are Sitting<br>
Now_ and in each discussion of the RICH economy, RAW allowed for people<br>
to design themselves out of their jobs via machinery. What do you really<br>
want -- people working as per status quo, or people not working as per<br>
RAW's suggested plan?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; QueenMuse:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The "LIVNGRY" you speak of has "enabled" the corfters for JUST long</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough to destroy their livelihood! As with Native Americans, it also sets</i><br>
<i>&gt; up a system where the government has</i><br>
<i>&gt; control, a hand out, and the power to provide - and the populace is</i><br>
<i>&gt; "disenfranchised" - or "dis-empowered". I do have compassion for these</i><br>
<i>&gt; people, and it is sadly disturbing, becauseas your post suggests, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem nor the solution is simple to solve.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But facts show:  we provide for people in need, we also rob them of</i><br>
<i>&gt; theirdignity!! It is a humanitarian's nightmare.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Me:  All I can say here is its all nonsense.  You are saying people</i><br>
<i>&gt; must work work work!  How puritan of you!  Yes, I did see the movie</i><br>
<i>&gt; transpotting.  Those people have no incentive to better themselves.</i><br>
<p>
You may remember this bit from the movie you cite, yet apparently missed<br>
the point of:<br>

<i>&gt; I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. </i><br>
<i>&gt; And the reasons? There are no reasons. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?</i><br>
<p>
Notice the past tense of the infinitive "to choose." <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Lee Daniel Crocker:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If one lacks the necessary tools to survive in that culture ( and by</i><br>
<i>&gt; your description they will) then Evolution will be as unkind today as it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is on our homeless little brothers in the streets..</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Me: Wouldn;t be nice just for once to not have to worry about</i><br>
<i>&gt; constantly updating your skills just to survive?  What a bitch.  Escape the</i><br>
<i>&gt; blind laws of evolution.  I want my MTV and Liesure!!!</i><br>

reference).<br>

Extropy is definitely in your future. :-)<br>
<p>
Everyone has the thorn in their flesh. You've made yours clear. Why not<br>
spend your time productively by suggesting ways to overcome "the blind<br>
laws of evolution" instead of lambasting people for citing them? <br>
<p>
"You've got these claws; you've got these fangs . . . You're looking at<br>
the claws, you're looking at the fangs . . ."<br>

Welcome to the list, Holly.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Lee Daniel Crocker:  Evolution is not "kind" or "unkind"; it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing more than a mathematical consequence of a certain set of initial</i><br>
<i>&gt; conditions: replication, mutation, competition.  Far better to understand and</i><br>
<i>&gt; make use of an existing effectthan to try to fight it.  You might as</i><br>
<i>&gt; well try fighting pi.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Me: What a defeatist attitude for an extropian.  Fuck Pi!  If I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to struggle for billions of years with String Theory or wormhole physics</i><br>
<i>&gt; to beat pi, I will!</i><br>
<p>
At this point you have sunk to irrationality. You can say "Fuck pi,"<br>
with no afterthought. Yet you refuse to consider the fact that<br>
evolution's laws are not necessarily immutable. Let's try to start from<br>
a common ground, then:<br>
<p>
"We, however, want to be those who we are -- the new, the unique, the<br>
incomparable, those who give themselves their own law, those who create<br>
themselves!"<br>

  <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Accept *NO* Limits!!</i><br>
<p>
Which limits do you think I accept?<br>
