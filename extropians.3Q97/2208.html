Deep and wise reflections about the Extro conference as it fades <br>
into the sunset along with the vapor trail of the plane that whisked <br>
this surly Easterner away from the land of palm trees and deserts....<br>
but maybe also a little gossip.<br>
<p>
I enjoyed the opportunity to indulge in broader bandwidth <br>
communications with persons who I have come to respect and like, and I <br>
know that I did not get to spend enough time with everyone, or even <br>
to actually meet every familiar name.  Will we ever outgrow the human <br>
need for physical proximity, to stand near, see a smile, share a <br>
meal, laugh together, dance just briefly?  Looking at us all gathered <br>
into one room, how frustratingly normal these bodies, how insufficient <br>
to express the fierce originality of thoughts generated within.  <br>
<p>
For one who has never seen past Texas, the sudden immersion in <br>
California tech culture quickly overwhelmed.  Even before <br>
reaching the Doubletree, I was taken on a whirlwind tour of the Stanford <br>
and Apple campuses, courtesy of my fellow airline passengers.  After the <br>
conference, several more days in Palo Alto and Stanford with one friend <br>
who works in biomedical informatics, and another in orbital <br>
mechanics.  Both of whom were impressed with my heretofore unnoticed <br>
ability to discuss Drexler, Minsky, and Dyson spheres!  <br>
<p>
Then, on to Berkely with my friend Jaime and, of all things, we ran into <br>
Robin Hanson, just moving into his new office building!  We explored <br>
his new home together.<br>
<p>
And then, San Francisco, for the less mindful pursuits of shopping, <br>
wandering, nightlife, and climbing Bryant Hill.  A day's drive along <br>
the coast, where we spotted the elusive mountain cows of Bodega Bay.  <br>
Shrieks from Jaime upon the discovery of monstrous alien seaweeds <br>
marooned on the sand.  Rocks that glowed pink on the cliff and grey in <br>
my hand.  Fog, powered by the sea wind, that swept across with the force <br>
of a rainshower.  Back to the Castro and Harrison Street for a long night <br>
of taking in the living carnivals behind every door.  The sudden <br>
realization that I'm leaving and Jaime's staying and the plane isn't <br>
going to wait, it being mechanical and not subject to the failings of <br>
human indecision.  <br>
<p>
And back, at last, to the warm embrace of loved ones here, <br>
and the even warmer embrace of the weather, a heat index of 105 degrees <br>
upon my descent into Baltimore!<br>
