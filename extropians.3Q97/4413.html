To all those who have read Banks,<br>
<p>
I recently subscribed to the Culture List hoping to find some liberated <br>
souls who share some of our extropian values.  I was wrong.  The list is <br>
dominated by statists of all kinds, who IMHO, have a an amazing 'trust' <br>
in authority to lead them.  I found this disheartening as I think 'The <br>
Culture' is an amazing vision of the future.  Does anybody think that <br>
'The Culture' and extropiansm are compatible or incompatible, and why?<br>
<p>
Some snips from the Culture List:<br>
<p>
I said:<br>
Then and only then will the 'Culture' become attainable - not through <br>
some state ordained process, but by the individual enlightenment of all <br>
its members.<br>
<p>
Response:<br>
<p>
Give me _one_ example of this happening?  Unfortunately all evidence<br>
tells me that the state is the lesser evil.  If the all its members<br>
(or most of them) are indeed enlightened and participates in <br>
controlling and defining what the state is, then I believe this<br>
to be a good and workable system.  Even in the most enlightened and<br>
free countries in the world this is not the case now, but I believe<br>
the alternatives are _much_ worse.<br>
<p>
It always suprises me that americans are so frightend of the state.<br>
In the US the state is much less prominent than in most european<br>
countries, but still they go on and on about 'big goverment' and<br>
what have you.  I think it was Wired Magazine that ran an article<br>
about what control the big credit companies have over you.  They<br>
amass lots of information about you and is under virtually no control.<br>
If it had not been for the state you would probably had no rigths<br>
to know what that information is or get them to remove false<br>
information about you.  To be honest I'm much more worried about<br>
what VISA knows about me than what the state knows.  At least the<br>
state doesn't sell the information to whoever wants to buy it, like<br>
these companies does.<br>
