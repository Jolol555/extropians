Someone I'm not targetting specifically wrote:<br>

} from a different poster.  As a newcomer to the list, I have no<br>
} satisfying way (except my patience, and the patience of others<br>
} reading my posts) of determining the effective culture of this<br>
<p>
You know, when I first joined, in the summer of 1993, when Perry<br>
Metzger, Romana Machado, David Friedman, Carl Feynman, David Krieger,<br>
Timothy May, and other names from the halcyon days were around, I hardly<br>
posted for two years, I think.  At least one year.  I was filled with<br>
awe at such a high signal group -- I think I came straight from<br>
alt.politics.libertarian, thanks to Tim Starr -- that it took so long to<br>
develop the confidence, comfort, and perhaps the ideas, to post<br>
frequently.  <br>
<p>
And official netiquette does suggest that newbies lurk for a few months<br>
to get the feel of a mailing list or newsgroup.<br>
<p>
Here's an idea for the Idea Futures... how long before someone starts a<br>
moderated or outright restricted extropians discussion list?<br>

"To this day, no one has settled the controversy over whether Christ's<br>
body is literally present in the bread and wine of the Communion.  This<br>
is unfortunate, since many people were executed for their divergent<br>
opinions on this issue.  It would be nice to know which ones got burned<br>
by mistake." -- Frank Sulloway, _Born to Rebel_<br>
