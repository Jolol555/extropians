Unfortunately, according to current jurisprudence, self-defense carries<br>
with it an objective standard of reasonableness. The standard being,<br>
what would a normal, reasonable, and prudent person do under the same or<br>
similar circumstances. In this situation, a jury would look at the<br>
circumstances, decide what the threat of violence really was, decide<br>
what self-defense was necessary, what self-defense was unnecessary but<br>
justified, and then decide if the self-defense exceeded these<br>
guidelines. It's all annoyingly arbitrary.  <br>

<i>&gt; Since Article Ten</i><br>
<i>&gt; defines the "militia" as any male between the ages of 18 and 40 (or is</i><br>
<i>&gt; it 45?),</i><br>
<p>
There is no Article 10. Goes only to Seven. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and also states that local sheriffs are empowered to</i><br>
<i>&gt; temporarily draft from the militia pool for local law enforcement needs</i><br>
<i>&gt; (where the "posse" concept came from), it is apparent that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; constitution intended every member of the "militia" to have authority</i><br>
<i>&gt; and responsibility for law enforcement within the confines of their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; property and family.</i><br>
<p>
This is nowhere to be found in the copy I have, unless I missed it<br>
entirely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I find another funny parallel, in rural Washington State, every county</i><br>
<i>&gt; but I beleive King, Thurston, Pierce, and Snohomish have passed in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; past three years county ordinances requiring every homeowner to posess a</i><br>
<i>&gt; gun and ammunition.</i><br>
<p>
This seems as grave a violation of one's freedoms as to disallow gun<br>
ownership completely.<br>
