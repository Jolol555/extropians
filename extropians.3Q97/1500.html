Warning: no scientific basis for any of the following, just musings.<br>
(vaguely in response to "meme supremacy" mailings). <br>
<p>
Discrimination 1---The simple kind of straightforward xenophobic "I hate<br>
you because you look (are) different" stuff, popular with kids and other<br>
mentally underdeveloped people. When consequently applied to people of<br>
(vaguely) the same genetic stock also called "racism".<br>
<p>
Discrimination 1b---Same as 1 except for the fact that the "offender"<br>
"knows better" (knows that the "target group" isn't really weird &amp; creepy<br>
but picks on them anyway out of pure malice. Common in all race and age<br>
groups.<br>
<p>
Discrimination 2---comparing looks and memes and concluding<br>
that they're different, and depending on the standards you use,<br>
that some are better than others (superior/inferior if you will). It<br>
can sometimes be observed that a certain meme occurs more frequently in (a)<br>
certain group(s) of people who clearly (looks, geography etc) share the<br>
same genetic background. Now if this meme happens to be bad by the<br>
particular standards that you use this means that in this field at least<br>
certain (genetic) groups as a whole will rank lower on your scale than<br>
certain other (genetic) groups. This could be called "scientifically based<br>
racism". This <br>
kind of "racism" does not hate, it just observes and concludes. <br>
It is a logical consequence of man's curiosity.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately it does happen quite often that emotionally unstable<br>
people or people of limited intellect confuse racism/discrimination 1<br>
with racism/discrimination 2, and thus react with rabid ferocity to<br>
neutral observations. It's even worse when people who can see<br>
the difference clearly, pretend to confuse the two in order to gain<br>
(cheap) status with the really blinded individuals and their peers.<br>
This is the kind of behaviour favoured by politicians and (other)<br>
community leaders. In many ways it is even more repugnant than<br>
the "dumb" no 1 racism and at least as bad as 1b, for it is <br>
sneaky and manipulative and devoid of any honest emotion.   <br>
<p>
Of course, in everyday interaction each person should be judged<br>
seperately, and not be unduely stereotyped, yet this is exactly<br>
what those (alledgedly) well-meaning anti-racists ("equalists")<br>
are doing; if you're branded a racist (iow *dared* to say something<br>
negative about a race (other than Caucasians) and negroes in<br>
particular than automatically everything you say (on whatever<br>
topic) will be deemed crap and those kind, peaceful and tolerant<br>
people all of a sudden turn out to be not-so-kind, tolerant &amp; peaceful<br>
at all. It appears they have plenty of exceptions to their general<br>
"humanistic" rule...<br>
<p>
All very understandable of course. Man, having evolved from an<br>
upright killer ape, couldn't have lost his violent primal urges <br>
overnight (on an evolutionary timescale). They're still in there,<br>
often well hidden and carefully suppressed, but there nonetheless.<br>
The "peaceful" hippy/liberal/humanist way is probably a very<br>
unnatural state of being for an originally agressive and opportu-<br>
nistic creature like man. That's why communes etc. seldom<br>
work. In fact, they seem to accelerate mental degeneration to<br>
an almost cave-man like state (the clan led by the Alpha male).<br>
Consequently, extropians also must vent their "primal anger"<br>
sometimes, and what better target than a "racist"...Well, glad<br>
to've been of service :)  <br>
<p>
Btw, you should see the movie "The Forbidden Planet" (60's I<br>
reckon). It shows what could happen to a (extropian-esque)<br>
society when it loses touch with (or: denies) it's more primitive <br>
side. Although the movie isn't much as a whole (though mildly<br>
entertaining), the point is clear for those who want to see it. <br>
Denial killed the cat.<br>
<p>
Your black neigbor may very well be your mental equal/superior, but<br>
the culture linked to his forefathers is inferior to the culture linked to<br>
 *your* forefathers if you measure by things like technological<br>
advancement, personal safety and possibilities for growth<br>
 (although *both* sets of cultures were and are highly inadequate<br>
by transhuman standards). This does not mean you should look down on your<br>
neighbor (just for this reason) because he isn't responsible for the<br>
actions of his forefathers (or those of his contemporaries of the same<br>
race). Consequently, you are not responsible for the actions of *your*<br>
forefathers (like slavery or genocide) so there are no flagellant guilt<br>
trips (like German youths "apologizing" for the holocaust), and (if you're<br>
being consequent) no such things as automatically returning "sacred land"<br>
to Indians <br>
or paying damages to the grandchildren of slaves. These are after all<br>
things of a long gone past, and today's generations cannot be held<br>
accountable  (assuming one argues within the realm of rationality). Every<br>
person should only be accountable for eir actions unless party in an<br>
"agreement" that states otherwise. Right?<br>
