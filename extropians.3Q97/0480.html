Fascinating.  Did you know what the case was about at the time of the<br>
question?  (I probably wouldn't consider attempting nullification for<br>
a violent crime, and I wouldn't admit my willingness to the judge<br>
pre-trial for a drug "crime".)<br>
<p>
The last time I was in a jury pool, we already knew that it was a<br>
violent rape case before I was dismissed (at the first opportunity<br>
after I answered questions individually).  The judge was taking great<br>
pains to make sure that the jurors would be able to look a bloody<br>
pictures without losing it.<br>
<p>
I've apparently established a reputation for being an expert on jury<br>
nullification, since my friends often come to me for advice when<br>
they've been called for Jury Duty.  About half of them ask me for help<br>
with the intent of finding out how to get out of Jury duty.  <br>
<p>
I, on the other hand, think of Jury duty not as something the state<br>
wants to coerce me into doing (though it clearly does.)  Rather than a<br>
responsibilty, I consider it to be a right.  It's one of the few<br>
opportunities a citizen in this country has to directly overrule the<br>
government.  It's also the only thing I can do to help ensure that<br>
there are some reasonable people in the jury pool.  If all<br>
libertarians, and all educated folk do their best to get out of jury<br>
duty, there'll be no one to listen critically to the prosecutor's<br>
testimony when I am falsely accused, or when I'm truly accused of some<br>
illegal behavior that shouldn't be a crime.<br>
