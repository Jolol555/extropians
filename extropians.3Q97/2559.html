I started wondering about your reality some time back, EvMick.<br>
Truck-driving extropian cowboy grandfather! Wow, What a persona.<br>
I then decided that actual reality isn't all that relevant. You're<br>
real enough to provide useful and entertaining insights, even when<br>
I disagree with your politics. Basically, we have uploaded a tiny<br>
portion of ourselves into a highly-restricted VR known as<br>
"extropians@extropy.org". If we choose to make software modifications<br>
to the upload, who cares?<br>
