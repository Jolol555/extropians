<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; But to show I can, I shall now prove four related propositions:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  1)  The sky is green.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  2)  The sky is purple.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  3)  The sky has red polka-dots.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  4)  (Generalized:)  The sky is any color.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  1)  Sun is yellow.  Sky is blue.  Yellow + blue = green.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  2)  The sky is purple, at night.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  3)  The stars are polka-dots.  Some of them are red giants.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  4)  There are many planets in the Universe.  Some of them will have skies of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  any given color.</i><br>
<p>
[Danny's rebutals] <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1) the sky is only blue and yellow, not green, but then again there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; sometimes tints of greens in storms and at sunsets</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2)if the sky is purple it isnt fully night, but then again in cities that</i><br>
<i>&gt; have pollution the sky may look purple</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3)stars are not polkadots, they're stars, but then again stars are just words</i><br>
<i>&gt; to define those bright round things in the sky, and they llok like points</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than dots, or maybe just very small dots</i><br>
<i>&gt; 4)you dont know for a fact about those planets, they could or couldnt, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; there's a high probability they could</i><br>
<p>
Very good work.  Now, if you can learn to apply those critical-thinking<br>
bullshit-detection skills to things you /want/ to believe, as well as those<br>
you don't, you'll be on your way to shedding your credulity for a more<br>
rational and productive mind.  One must judge a truth not by how true it<br>
sounds or feels, but by how well it holds up to criticism.  If you don't<br>
even /try/ to criticize every idea, then you'll fall for anything.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The proof about astrology is that is that many if not all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; predictions are correct in some way...</i><br>
<p>
Yes, in two ways in particular: predictions that are vague enough to<br>
not be measurable, and in the beliefs of its adherents.<br>
<p>
Here's a simple experiment you can do at home: find as many friends or<br>
family as you can that /do not/ regularly read newspaper horoscopes<br>
and note their birthdays.  Over a period of several weeks, record the<br>
predictions made by the horoscope section of your local paper, then<br>
call each friend, flip a coin, and either read em the prediction for<br>
for eir sign, or a randomly chosen one.  Ask em if the prediction is<br>
accurate for that week, and record all the results.  Don't tell them<br>
where you're getting the horoscopes.  Be honest about the test: flip<br>
the coin fairly, take the first prediction in the text, and demand<br>
a yes or no response /for that week only/.  It's even better if /you/<br>
don't know which is the "correct" horoscope when you ask.  You can<br>
arrange that by having someone else flip the coin and choose for you,<br>
and only record the result /after/ you get the answer.<br>
<p>
After a few weeks, plot the accuracy of the predictions.  You will<br>
find that the randomly selected ones do just as well as the "correct"<br>
ones, and that your friends will tell you that you're a miraculously<br>
accurate mindreader, even if they get random ones, because people<br>
interpret horoscopes to mean what they want them to mean.<br>
<p>
This experiment and similar ones are done regularly by science classes<br>
(though not as regularly as they should be), and thousands upon<br>
thousands of trials produce the same result: for any measurable criterion,<br>
astrology performs no better than chance, every time.  But the subjects<br>
always /think/ it does.<br>
