One of the most difficult decisions you have to make in public discussions<br>
is how to deal with people possessed by dangerous memes.  If you let the<br>
meme go unanswered, it might propagate even though the logic behind it is<br>
so weak.  If you answer it, you might raise the stature of that meme in<br>
other people's eyes, you certainly prolong the annoying thread, and you<br>
waste your own time that you could use productively.  By and large, I tend<br>
to answer it.<br>
<p>
Everyone else is free to skip this.  If you want something to get the bad<br>
taste out of your mouth, read anything by Thomas Sowell.  He writes clearly<br>
and interestingly about the long-term effects of culture and cultural<br>
dislocation, and it will give you a good historical perspective on this<br>
debate.<br>

Surprise, surprise.  People immigrate into a culture that has a<br>
long-standing meme about the only large racial minority the society had<br>
until then (imported, mind you, into a slave system that lasted 400 years<br>
and deliberately destroyed the cultural structures that help people<br>
succeed), and the new immigrants pick up the dominant culture's nice,<br>
little, protective, scapegoat meme.  Yes, all races distrust others, it's a<br>
meme thing.  That many of them pick on Blacks is not evidence of much.<br>

<i>&gt;"Prejudice" as the media like to call it is often simple rational thinking.</i><br>
<p>
Prejudice and stereotyping I can deal with.  They are useful ways of making<br>
quick decisions without using a lot of valuable mental energy.  But if you<br>
hold on to your stereotypes in the face of evidence and logical<br>
counter-arguments, you're an idiot.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The facts: the whole of central and southern Africa hasn't produced</i><br>
<i>&gt;an even remotely technolological "modern civilization". </i><br>
<p>
What does this have to do with genetic determination of intelligence and<br>
potential?  Are you saying that "civilization" is a result of intelligence?<br>
 I have read an interesting book that claimed agriculture was only<br>
economically rational above a certain population density (Douglas North,<br>
Structure and Change in Economic History), and this was even more true of<br>
cities.  Regardless, we know very little about ancient civilizations, and<br>
even less about the archeological record of Africa, so I don't give much<br>
weight to this assertion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Fact: they did not even invent the wheel or bow and arrow.  </i><br>
<p>
What is this supposed to imply? Caucasians probably didn't either, they<br>
just learned them from someone else.  If I come up with two other early<br>
technologies Africans had, are we even?  It's far easier for me to believe<br>
that stable civilization is an accident of history, sustained by<br>
geographical characteristics that allow for exposure to and trade with<br>
other cultures.  Sub-Saharan Africa, unfortunately, was geographically very<br>
isolated. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Unlike for example native</i><br>
<i>&gt;Americans they did not adapt when confronted by white (Boer) settlers</i><br>
<i>&gt;and were crushed (while the American natives were primarily defeated</i><br>
<i>&gt;by "alien" diseases like smallpox).</i><br>
<p>
Native Americans, in both North and South America, may have "adapted", but<br>
they were demonstrably less successful.  Their culture was practically<br>
wiped from the face of the two continents, replaced by an imported culture<br>
that has controlled the area ever since.  Africa, on the other hand, is<br>
still largely African.  Even in South Africa, the Boers and English didn't<br>
manage to immigrate or reproduce enough to even match, much less<br>
out-number, the native races.  Could it be characteristics of the African<br>
environment that make our western memes or genes less advantageous there?<br>
As Africa slowly pulls itself out of the miserable quagmire of colonial<br>
rule and cold-war supported dictators, I suspect your genetic theory will<br>
loose what credibility it has.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Black Africans have been favoured as</i><br>
<i>&gt;slaves since ancient times, because they were often well built and</i><br>
<i>&gt;none too bright. They *are* generally less in control of their</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotions...the list goes on and on. It's really too bad for the blacks, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;history and present day reality are rather harsh judges. There is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;"justice" in nature, just in our heads. </i><br>
<p>
Now, you presented the last set as facts, and I am willing to argue them on<br>
interpretation.  You have *no* evidence for these claims, so I won't bother. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now if you really want to help you have to acknowledge the problem</i><br>
<i>&gt;first. And of course there are plenty of smart, kind and "civilized" </i><br>
<i>&gt;blacks equal or even better than many whites, but...a) they are often</i><br>
<i>&gt;of mixed race, so "genetically enhanced" and no longer real "blacks"</i><br>
<p>
(I don't know if I can finish this.  You're making me queasy.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;b) they could fully develop themselves only because they grew up in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;white "civilized" culture that is reasonably supportive (certainly when</i><br>
<i>&gt;compared to a primitive tribe) of critical thinking, science etc.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, so now you say that cultural context in necessary for individual<br>
intellectual growth.  So if I didn't happen to live within a technical<br>
civilization, would that be evidence that I am genetically less intelligent?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Believe me, these modern blacks don't feel much of a "bond" with </i><br>
<i>&gt;their less advanced congeners. And why would they...mental</i><br>
<i>&gt;properties are after all more important than looks...right?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now about the meme thing: do you honestly belief that "all memes </i><br>
<i>&gt;are equal"? If so, why aren't you over at Christian chat or Commytalk?</i><br>
<i>&gt;After all...it's all the same thing.</i><br>
<p>
I don't get this.  I don't think that all memes are equal, and that's one<br>
of the factors to which I ascribe the problems Blacks have today, both in<br>
the US and in Africa.  You, on the other hand, seem to be arguing that<br>
meme's are racially, or genetically, determined.  Which is it?<br>
