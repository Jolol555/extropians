Interesting. There is no easy way to tell whether you are right. The <br>
maturation time of nanotechnology is certainly an important parameter <br>
in predicting the future. There are two things I could take issue <br>
with. (1) Will nanotech mature slowly? And (2), given slow <br>
maturation, will that mean that a multipolar world order can remain <br>
stable?<br>
<p>
(1)<br>
Why exactly do you think every stage will take thousands of <br>
genius years? (I presume you mean good-scientists years?)  Isn't the <br>
design work fairly tractable (Drexler has already produced some nice <br>
designs) and it is mainly the lack of molecular tools that prevent us <br>
from starting building things? Better CAM would help a lot, and it is <br>
on its way.<br>
	As you point out, each partial achievment would bring great benefits <br>
to the power that makes it, so wouldn't this mean that it would have <br>
a good chance of pushing further ahead, leaving the competition <br>
behind?<br>
	If superinelligence (that could perform a thousand genius years in a <br>
short time) comes before nanotech, or is developed at an early stage <br>
of nanotech, then the bottle neck would almost certainly be the <br>
hardware, the molecular tools, and in such a case the maturation <br>
process would be almost instantaneous.<br>
<p>
(2)<br>
I believe the answer to the second question is No. I think there <br>
would either be a negotiated merger, or the stronger power would <br>
obliterate the weaker, and then immediately rebuild itself, and then <br>
expand spherically at a good fraction of the light speed. A Yes <br>
answer to (2) would presuppose that a negotiated merger isn't made, <br>
and that neither power can know with a great probability that it is <br>
strongest, or that the stronger power has some absolute ethical <br>
prohibition from attacking its weaker rival.<br>
