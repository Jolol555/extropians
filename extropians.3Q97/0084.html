Being concerned with the future progress of humankind <br>
should be the prime concern of all civilized beings. <br>

<i>&gt;&gt; This dialogue, although quite enjoyable, seems to be going off on</i><br>
tangents<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of the hypothetical extremes. This is not that bad, nor is it that</i><br>
good.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What tangents? Every argument you have made without substantiation has</i><br>
<i>&gt;been countered with statistical evidence, which you continue to ignore</i><br>
<i>&gt;or constest. Is this an admittance of error or merely an aversion to</i><br>
<i>&gt;confrontation?</i><br>
<p>
Not entirely true. Much of my response was not statistical. Here's more:<br>
<p>
I don't consider fundamentals of human behavior to be tangents, but<br>
postulates.<br>
A.M. seems to be interested in developing what seems to ba a Fabian vision<br>
of <br>
well-mannered perfect(able) abstractions. Wow. 6+ billion and counting,<br>
surely <br>
a tall order? Well, not if one makes the proper simplifying assumptions.<br>
<p>
It's a bit like the old joke whose punch line goes "assume a spherical<br>
cat..."<br>
Or like Lenin musing aloud to his crowd, "What is to be done?"<br>
<p>
NOTE: No, A.M., I am not calling you Lenin. OK?<br>
<p>
I'd love to help engender a world where people respect each other more. <br>
I hope, by my agnostic vision of godliness, to make some contribution in<br>
that wise.<br>
But, to quote myself,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When respect for one's fellow man is strong, arms are an utter non-issue.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Absent that respect, what remains?</i><br>
<p>
I consider the first sentence true, based on personal experience. <br>
I consider the following question fundamental, not tangential.<br>
<p>
There is nothing abstract about a twice-previously-raped career nurse<br>
being <br>
accosted in a parking garage. Nothing *whatsoever*. How _dare_ anyone deny<br>
<p>
her the power to stop her assailant?<br>
<p>
Sorry, I guess the present day is just an unpleasant hypothetical.<br>
I'm sure glad that nurse is only in my mind.<br>
Let's plan a perfect future world, it's so much nicer, so much realer. <br>
Just like Epcot Center.<br>
<p>
And regarding Wellsian technocratic "futurist" central-planning<br>
"exegesis":<br>
Be very suspicious of anyone who tells you "I know what's best for you"--<br>
unless you *are* a child.<br>

Dear Michael and other fellow Extropians,<br>
<p>
I guess that for some people the glass will always be half empty.<br>
<p>
I'd still like to try to fill the glass with joy.<br>
<p>
Enjoy!!!<br>
