Between the time of your death and infinity, the chances are you will be<br>
resurrected in some form.  There are several ways in which this could happen.<br>
 You could preserve your brain at the time of death and have it reanimated at<br>
a later point, you could simply die and then at some point in the future<br>
exist as a computer simulation or you could wait until you are a natural<br>
rerun.<br>
<p>
If time is infinite then theoretically every eventuality will occur an<br>
infinite number of times.  Therefore, at some point we will all be<br>
reincarnated in every possible form that can carry on our conscious mind.<br>
 However, there is likely to be a very large amount of time between death and<br>
resurrection, unless we are in control of the process (cryonics).  <br>
<p>
For a rerun to occur (a being that develops so similar to yourself it carries<br>
on your consciousness) the surrounding world would have to be exact in every<br>
detail up to the point of your death (so that the being has the same memories<br>
and 'thinks' it is you).  For transhumans this seems pointless as you gain<br>
nothing from it, it does hold one interesting point to all those looking<br>
forward to an afterlife.  They will live, but they won't know they've died.<br>
<p>
Simulation as a posthumans recollection of the past, or as an experiment<br>
could also rerun dead minds.  After simulating the consciousness of our<br>
chosen victim, we could then put them into a steady state of evolution to<br>
become fellow posthumans.<br>
<p>
Preserving yourself at the time of death gives you a smaller time frame in<br>
which to be reincarnated and would hopefully mean you'd have someone around<br>
to tell you what happened.<br>
<p>
Not dying in the first place seems like a good idea, but whatever happens<br>
you're not going to die.  However, you might be resurrected in the year<br>
98,000,023, be reincarnated in a mirror universe (not that you would know) or<br>
be subjected to some nasty multiple consciousness paradoxes.<br>
<p>
In short, even if we are all immortal, it's better to be in control of your<br>
own resurrection (especially if time turns out to be finite, in which case<br>
we're all screwed).<br>
