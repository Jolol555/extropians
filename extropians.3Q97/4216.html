I have been reminded by both posts regarding "NSPIC" that the religion<br>
phenomenon is of the same stuff as the statism phenomenon.  The<br>
manipulation of language by those who would have others believe in a<br>
certain brand of holiness or magic appears to make such a belief<br>
inevitable.  As editor of NOMOS I was once in debate with a writer who<br>
wanted me to publish his definitive proof of the existence of god--only<br>
problem was that his opening axiom was that there are certain things<br>
which must be taken on "faith" (one of those words of which we speak).<br>
<p>
And, really, the entire phenomenon of looking at society through a<br>
certain neuro-linguistic model is widespread--as I embarked upon<br>
homeschooling my children, I remember being appalled at other young<br>
mothers who were enchanted that the state had generously taken the<br>
burden of registering their children into school from them, sending the<br>
forms home fait accompli! Expectations, assumption, all built upon<br>
laziness of mind, fear of responsibility.  So the question is whether<br>
the language is the key or the essential assumption that "I don't have<br>
to make this decision or that choice as it has been predigested by those<br>
who know".<br>
