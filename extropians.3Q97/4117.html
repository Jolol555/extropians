I want to welcome Wei Dai to the extropians list.  I know he will make an<br>
interesting contribution.<br>
<p>
It is a very good question how probabilities would work when you start<br>
thinking of cloning.  We have had only a bit of discussion on this in<br>
the past, sometimes in the context of the many words interpretation of<br>
QM, sometimes in the context of cloning or mind cloning.<br>
<p>
The way I look at it is this.  Consider repetitions of the experiment,<br>
and for each person who results, look at what fraction of outcomes he<br>
has seen in his lifetime.  The limit, as the repetitions approach<br>
infinity, would be the probability.<br>
<p>
This justifies probability on the basis of past experience.  We expect<br>
a coin to flip with 50-50 odds because we have always seen it work<br>
that way in the past.  I believe people whose predictions of probability<br>
coincide with their later experiences of events will be most successful,<br>
hence this definition of probability will spread and become accepted.<br>
(However, there are some paradoxical aspects to this definition.)<br>
<p>
In Wei's experiment, when we do the repetitions, each person who<br>
results from each stage gets the experiment done to him.  So after<br>
each time the coin lands heads, twice as many people will be the<br>
subjects of the experiment.  Obviously we cannot keep this going for<br>
too long!<br>
<p>
I have to change the wording of Wei's questions slightly because now<br>
the experiment is being repeated.  Here is the wording I would use:<br>
<p>
1. What is the probability that you were just cloned (that is, that you<br>
were just created as a copy of another person on this last coin flip)?<br>
<p>
2. What is the probability that the coin landed head up on the most<br>
recent coin flip?<br>
<p>
3. You were not cloned as a result of the most recent coin flip. What<br>
is the probability that the coin landed head up?"<br>
<p>
Here is a chart where I have tried to trace the people who result from<br>
a sequence of coin flips.  I show 6 coin flips, which for specificity<br>
fall H,T,H,T,H,T.  I think my results will be valid for other<br>
plausible coin flips.  We start with person 1, and after the first coin<br>
comes up H, we have his copy, person 2.  These people then participate<br>
in further runs of the experiment.  After 6 coin flips we have heads<br>
3 times, and so there are 2^3 or 8 people at the end.<br>
<p>
I mark with a (*) each person who finds that he is is a newly created<br>
copy after the most recent coin flip.<br>
<p>
<p>

    1   2*<br>
<i>    |   |</i><br>
    T   T<br>
<i>    |   |</i><br>
    1   2<br>
<i>    |     \</i><br>

    T   T   T      T<br>
<i>    |   |   |      |</i><br>
    1   3   2      4<br>
<i>    |     \   \       \</i><br>
    H       H   H        H<br>
<i>    | \     | \   \ --\    \---\</i><br>

<i>    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |</i><br>

    1   5   3   6   2   7   4   8<br>
    <br>
Now, using this chart we can answer the questions above by simple<br>
counting.  Below I show the values which will be calculated by each<br>
person, with the person number in the left column followed by the odds<br>
he calculates from his history line.<br>
<p>
1. What is the probability that you were just cloned (that is, that you<br>
were just created as a copy of another person on this last coin flip)?<br>
(Count fraction of stars on each history line.)<br>
<p>
1 - 0/6<br>
2 - 1/6<br>
3 - 1/6<br>
4 - 2/6<br>
5 - 1/6<br>
6 - 2/6<br>
7 - 2/6<br>
8 - 3/6<br>
<p>
Average odds are 1/4.  This number should be the same after any number<br>
of coin flips.<br>
<p>
2. What is the probability that the coin landed head up on the most<br>
recent coin flip?<br>
<p>
1 - 3/6<br>
2 - 3/6<br>
3 - 3/6<br>
4 - 3/6<br>
5 - 3/6<br>
6 - 3/6<br>
7 - 3/6<br>
8 - 3/6<br>
<p>
Average odds are 1/2.  This will obviously be independent of the number<br>
of coin flips.<br>
<p>
3. You were not cloned as a result of the most recent coin flip. What<br>
is the probability that the coin landed head up?"<br>
(Ignore the starred items and calculate fraction of heads)<br>
<p>
1 - 3/6<br>
2 - 2/5<br>
3 - 2/5<br>
4 - 1/4<br>
5 - 2/5<br>
6 - 1/4<br>
7 - 1/4<br>
8 - 0/3<br>
<p>
Average odds are 49/160.  I'm too tired to work out what this will<br>
limit to as the number of coin flips increase, but it is not far from<br>
Wei's suggestion of 1/3.<br>
<p>
So, assuming I haven't made an arithmetic mistake (which is possible;<br>
it took me about 4 tries so far), I come out pretty close to Wei's<br>
answer of A. 1) 1/4, 2) 1/2, 3) 1/3.  It looks to me like these are<br>
the average fractions of the time a group of participants will have<br>
encountered "yes" answers when they leave the experiment.<br>
