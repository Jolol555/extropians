I found this a while ago while surfing. It may not apply here, but I thought<br>
it might be interesting to those who haven't seen it before. It's hardly a<br>
rigorous study, probably based on the author's personal experience. I'd expect<br>
evidence in support of it to be mostly anecdotal. Nonetheless, my experience<br>
and intuition suggests it is probably not too far off the mark.<br>
<p>
<p>

<p>
THE NATURAL LIFE CYCLE OF MAILING LISTS<br>
<p>
Every list seems to go through the same cycle:<br>
<p>
1. Initial enthusiasm (people introduce themselves, and gush a lot about<br>
how wonderful it is to find kindred souls).<br>
<p>
2. Evangelism (people moan about how few folks are posting to the list,<br>
and brainstorm recruitment strategies).<br>
<p>
3. Growth (more and more people join, more and more lengthy threads<br>
develop, occasional off-topic threads pop up).<br>
<p>
4. Community (lots of threads, some more relevant than others; lots of<br>
information and advice is exchanged; experts help other experts as<br>
well as less experienced colleagues; friendships develop; people tease<br>
each other; newcomers are welcomed with generosity and patience;<br>
everyone -- newbie and expert alike -- feels comfortable asking<br>
questions, suggesting answers, and sharing opinions).<br>
<p>
5. Discomfort with diversity (the number of messages increases<br>
dramatically; not every thread is fascinating to every reader; people<br>
start complaining about the signal-to-noise ratio; person 1 threatens<br>
to quit if *other* people don't limit discussion to person 1's pet<br>
topic; person 2 agrees with person 1; person 3 tells 1 &amp; 2 to lighten<br>
up; more bandwidth is wasted complaining about off-topic threads than<br>
is used for the threads themselves; everyone gets annoyed).<br>
<p>
6a. Smug complacency and stagnation (the purists flame everyone who asks<br>
an 'old' question or responds with humor to a serious post; newbies<br>
are rebuffed; traffic drops to a doze-producing level of a few minor<br>
issues; all interesting discussions happen by private email and are<br>
limited to a few participants; the purists spend lots of time<br>
self-righteously congratulating each other on keeping off-topic<br>
threads off the list).<br>
<p>
OR<br>
<p>
6b. Maturity (a few people quit in a huff; the rest of the participants<br>
stay near stage 4, with stage 5 popping up briefly every few weeks;<br>
many people wear out their second or third 'delete' key, but the list<br>
lives contentedly ever after).<br>
