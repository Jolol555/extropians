[SNIP]<br>
I think we have a "minor" speed-of-light problem here.<br>
Unless the galaxy brains find a way around relativity, <br>
then a galaxy brain cannot coordinate it;s own<br>
actions in less than roughly the time it takes to<br>
traverse a galaxy twice, which is on the order of<br>
100K years. I personally believe that any SI is essentially<br>
incomprehensible to use mere humans, but if I were an SI, I'd<br>
start by concentrating my available mass to increase my<br>
effective interaction rate. My rate of increase of effective<br>
capacity would be limited by the rate at which I could<br>
concentrate matter. There is a trade-off here. I could<br>
increase my accretion rate by increasing the acceleration of<br>
the matter but (without some new physics) I would have to<br>
expend reaction mass to increase my accretion rate. This mass<br>
is lost, so while my accretion rate goes up, my ultimate<br>
acquired mass goes down. If the SI can disciver some new physical<br>
principles, it may be able to get around this by using a<br>
gravity drive (or something.) However, unless it also sidesteps<br>
relativity, galaxies can interact only on the million-year<br>
timescale. I'm unwilling to speculate on the motivations and<br>
actions of even a modest SI (say 10 times as smart as the<br>
smartest human.) I'm a lot less willing to speculate on the<br>
motivations and actions of a million-year-old galaxy brain.<br>
