Not really.  The protection afforded by a corporation is that individuals<br>
generally can't be held responsible for the misdeeds of the entire<br>
organization.  Individuals *can* be held personally liable for their<br>
individual actions, within the employment regulations regarding such things<br>
(which are generally applicable to all businesses).<br>
<p>
If you, as a businessman, own an unincorporated company and the yokels in<br>
engineering unleash a fatal flaw, you are *personally* liable for their<br>
screwup as sole proprietor of the company.  If you were incorporated and<br>
the same thing happened, the most you could lose is your company.  The<br>
corporate structure is practically necessary for large businesses.  The<br>
necessity of incorporation for small businesses is considerably more<br>
debatable.<br>
