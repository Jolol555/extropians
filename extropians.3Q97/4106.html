Dear Associates on list extropians,<br>
<p>
The following note will introduce a topic that has held my interest since I<br>
was first introduced to it in 1953 as the Marketing Engineer on a project to<br>
develop a new automatic dispatching system (ADS) for the electric power<br>
industry.  The successful prototype system dispatched only nine power plants<br>
owned by a single corporation operating in an interconnected power system of<br>
many power companies, and the new ADS product was eventually applied on all<br>
of the many power companies in the interconnected system.  That was an easy<br>
sale, because the theory and practice of operating interconnected sovereign<br>
power companies with a minimum fuel input to the whole system, that is, at an<br>
optimum dispatch as limited by safety and system stability considerations,<br>
was fully developed in the 1930's and '40's and known to all operating<br>
companies in the interconnection.  But in the social sciences there is no<br>
generally accepted theory, and the practice of law makers is "smash and grab"<br>
without regard to the nature and life-cycle of the productive human assets<br>
which constitute our social systems.  I am not saying that human beings are<br>
are as simple as power plants, but I believe that the analytical methods of<br>
the physical sciences have a vital role to play in the social sciences, if<br>
the powers that be will allow it.<br>
<p>
Your response to this note, if any, will determine if the TEFLON TOPIC should<br>
be part of the ADVANCED FREEDOM DEBATE ON THE NEURO-SEMANTIC POLITICAL<br>
ILLUSION COMPLEX (NSPIC).<br>
<p>
Best wishes for the success of the debate,<br>
<p>

Subj.:	A Conceptual Framework For The TEFLON Topic<br>
Date:	97-08-20 16:27:56 EDT<br>
From:	WesBurt<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Dear Masters of  All Natural, Capital, and Human Assets:<br>
<p>
In my note of 97-08-09 to all concerned lurkers on the internet, I misspoke<br>
when I wrote: "This TRANSPARENT or TEFLON topic consists of two parts, (1) a<br>
Macro view of society as a WHOLE, and, (2) a Micro view of any one person of<br>
any possible age or condition within that society."  <br>
<p>
For practical purposes the topic must consist of two Macro models as<br>
described in my note of 97-08-09, or four parts, in order to establish a<br>
conceptual framework capable of representing "society as a WHOLE."  This is<br>
because every society, from a self-sufficient village to the world economy,<br>
consists of the same three components, that is: (1) a population of people,<br>
(2) their environment and accumulated physical assets, and (3) the continuous<br>
flow of physical goods and services which are produced, saved, invested,<br>
wasted, or consumed by the particular society in question.  <br>
<p>
One Macro model measures, describes, and locates the net output of the<br>
environment and accumulated physical assets of the society within the<br>
conceptual framework.  A second Macro model measures, describes, and locates<br>
the net output (or consumption) of each member of the society within the<br>
conceptual framework.  While the third component, the continuous flow of<br>
physical goods and services which we call the Gross National Product (GNP),<br>
flows through both Macro models to make the conceptual framework a single<br>
system that comprehends everything this side of the continuous energy input<br>
which the earth receives from the sun.  <br>
<p>
Notice that the only purposeful actors in this framework are the members of<br>
society, and they have been acting ever since time was first invented, so the<br>
whole earth framework that we are looking at is the final result of all<br>
previous HUMAN ACTION, as von Mises put it, and presently includes a<br>
population of 4+ billion people, a present GNP of about $4,000/year per<br>
person, and a vast accumulation of wealth in the form of public<br>
infrastructure and personal property.  But, when the framework is moved below<br>
the level of the whole earth to focus on one nation at a time in our<br>
laboratory of nations, the World Bank reports an astonishing, indeed an<br>
obscene, range of GNP/capita in a world society that is supposed to be bound<br>
together by a world-wide communication network.   <br>
<p>
Taking World Bank figures for 1994 in order of increasing GNP/capita we find<br>
Ethiopia at $130/year/capita, Haiti at 220, the Russian Federation at 2,650,<br>
Mexico near the world average at 4,010, Ireland at 13,630, the U.K. at<br>
18,410, Germany at 25,580, the U.S. at 25,860, Japan at 34,630, Switzerland<br>
at 37,180, and Luxembourg at $39,850/year/capita.  An unbiased observer could<br>
not help but conclude that our vaunted world-wide communications system has<br>
been used more often to obstruct, than to facilitate, the diffusion of<br>
knowledge among the peoples of the earth.  He might also wonder about the<br>
sorry condition of the less fortunate Ethiopians if the Ethiopian national<br>
average is only $130/year/capita, and about the future condition of Americans<br>
who seem oblivious of the fact that their output/capita was 171% of Swiss<br>
output/capita in 1949 and is now only 70% of Swiss in 1994.  Is this what<br>
Charles Murray was thinking about when he wrote LOSING GROUND and THE BELL<br>
CURVE?<br>
<p>
Speaking of the diffusion of knowledge among the peoples of the earth,  we<br>
read in Etienne Gilson's condensation of the original Forward to Saint<br>
Augustine's THE CITY OF GOD:<br>
<p>
  "ONE WORLD is impossible without ONE GOD and ONE CHURCH.  In this truth<br>
lies the ever timely message conveyed to man by St. Augustine's CITY OF GOD."<br>
 <br>
<p>
After fifteen centuries of failing to realize any of Saint Augustine's three<br>
worthy objectives, the public needs to be informed about the original and<br>
most essential requirement for achieving those objectives.  That requirement<br>
is to promulgate a complete statement of the ONE LAW, a statement which makes<br>
one God, one World, and one Church technically credible.  Alexander the great<br>
knew of, but did not live long enough to implement, that original and most<br>
essential requirement.  The status-quo has been perpetuated for an additional<br>
twenty-three centuries because an incomplete knowledge and an incomplete<br>
application of the natural laws have financially favored the gay, lesbian,<br>
single, celibate, elderly, and wealthy households while retarding the<br>
financial development of every young dumb parenting family.  This whole<br>
process of perpetual injustice has been self-sustaining since Holy Scripture<br>
promulgated the Decalogue containing 5/6ths of the Law in the Book of Exodus<br>
without connecting the Decalogue to the Three Tithes of Moses which contained<br>
the other 2/6ths of the Law in the Book of Numbers.  As the young parents<br>
grow old, they insist that the following generations must suffer the same<br>
retarding effects which they suffered under an incomplete version of the Law.<br>
 The elderly say, "It will strengthen their children's character, make them<br>
as virtuous as we are, and keep them from becoming more successful than we<br>
were."  <br>
<p>
The ultimate question about the utility of a technically valid conceptual<br>
framework for an industrial society seems to be this:  Will it enable the<br>
elderly (George Soros, George Bush, Peter G. Peterson, and David Rockefeller)<br>
to embrace both parts of the ONE LAW when formulating public policy?  Or,<br>
will we continue to apply the whole Law to our capital assets and only 5/6th<br>
of the Law to our human assets?<br>
<p>
Let's hear that sparkling dialogue from the Lurkers,<br>
