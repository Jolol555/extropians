<i>&gt; From: EvMick@aol.com</i><br>
<i>&gt; Date: Tuesday, July 08, 1997 10:10 PM</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In a message dated 97-07-08 11:06:36 EDT, you write:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; I think reproduction would expand to fill all available areas as soon</i><br>
as<br>
<i>&gt;  possible.  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Whence the Fermi Paradox?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Doesn't (mumble mumble)'s Law indicate that there has already been time</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough for the entire galaxy to have been colonized?</i><br>
<p>
Of course.  I'm just using the rules of natural selection, and our current<br>
understanding of physics, to describe what would happen if such entities<br>
evolved.  I cannot completely explain the Fermi Paradox, obviously.  My<br>
only guess is that there are more efficient ways to get energy and matter<br>
to convert to mind than paving the universe.  I do not have suggestions as<br>
to what those are.  It's just that after a billion years, it would seem<br>
intelligence would discover some physics we do not have an inkling of now.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I would point out two possibly pertinent points.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As the level of affluence goes up....the birthrate goes down....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The only reason that the U.S.'s population is going up is</i><br>
immigration....the<br>
<i>&gt; "natives" are below ZPG. As is true in other industrialized nations.</i><br>
<p>
Irrelevant.  We have to take care of our young.  Human beings are a bad<br>
model for the far future of intelligence.  The ecosystem is a better model.<br>
 Memetic evolution is useful as well.  The effect of wealth on human minds<br>
is likely to tell us nothing.  Postbiological minds could colonize the<br>
universe with small seeds that started converting matter into mind as soon<br>
as it got near a star.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; REALLY HIGH Tech.  (Nanotechnology, Uploading and consequently Very</i><br>
Virtual<br>
<i>&gt; Reality) </i><br>
<i>&gt; Suppose  that when a society reaches a certain level it IMPLODES.  </i><br>
Expanding<br>
<i>&gt; into Cyberspace at many hundred multiples of lightspeed....but that  that</i><br>
<i>&gt; cyberspace is expanding only at the speed that the society's nanotech is</i><br>
<i>&gt; converting all ambiet matter into computational machinery...</i><br>
<p>
	Virtual reality maybe fun but it does not get much accomplished.  You<br>
cannot explore new physics without a connection to the outside world.  You<br>
also cannot avoid dangers.  Those entities that concentrated their efforts<br>
on avoiding real threats would be more successful than those that divided<br>
their time between the real world and artificial worlds.  Survival (of<br>
replicators) is the name of the game.  If it doesn't help survival, it's<br>
useless (evolutionarily speaking).<br>
	You might also want to chose a better metaphor.  I find "Expanding into<br>
Cyberspace at many hundred multiples of lightspeed..." to be so vague<br>
(using c to measure distance through ideaspace, where there is no light) as<br>
to be meaningless.<br>
