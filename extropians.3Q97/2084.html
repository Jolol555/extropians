For those who think they are unattractive, it helps show that<br>
non-physical elements are far more important than the media<br>
lets on, and that the range of "desired" is much broader in real life<br>
than in modeling, acting, and pornography.  For anybody, knowledge of<br>
psychology, goals, and techniques of sex and sexual attraction allow<br>
one to make oneself more desirable, to more precisely target those who<br>
would desire you, and to<br>
make oneself more of a value to one's partner(s).<br>

You’d be suprised how many women would find many of you fellow male<br>
extropians attractive.  I recall several women remarking how cute<br>
Anders Sandberg was based on the presentation of his lecture - not<br>
that Anders is already a stud anyway.  Many women today are just as<br>
attracted to brain power as physical brawn - so don’t give up hope!<br>
