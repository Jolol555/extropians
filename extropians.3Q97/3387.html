In a message dated 97-09-10 22:52:35 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 Please, I hate to enter into it with you, because I know who i am <br>
 arguing with, but how can someone be poor AND rich at the same time? &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
WEll speaking as one ole truckdriver....<br>
<p>
Today's "street person' i.e homeless...live in wealth beyond dreams of<br>
avarice of the serfs of the middle ages.<br>
<p>
Or to put it another way...<br>
<p>
In times gone by only the ruling class, those with "the divine right of<br>
Kings"...had such things as....more than one set of clothes....<br>
<p>
So poor by todays standards...(I was In South East Asian during the Viet Nam<br>
fisasco...you wanna talk about POOR?  There ARE no poor in current day USA.)<br>
is rich...haloucinagenically rich...by standards of the past.<br>
<p>
And starve?  In the US?  I don't THINK so.  Not unless they are terminally<br>
stupid...too many freeebies available.<br>
<p>
Hint: Try explaining a VCR...or even a TV to Pharoh Rameses II...or King<br>
Edward the whatever.<br>
<p>
In the not too distant past the average life expectancy was ......20.<br>
By that standard I'm working on three life spans...and NO ONE could call me<br>
rich....I'm just a poor ole truck driver.....work my 100 hrs a week (give or<br>
take) and be glad to have it...<br>
