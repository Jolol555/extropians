I remember seeing it, but I don't remember where.  They said something like<br>
"Cold Fusion is possible in a laboratory environment but is too costly to be<br>

Actually, the government is feeding you mis-misinformation, everything they<br>
tell you is true because they know you wont believe it.<br>
