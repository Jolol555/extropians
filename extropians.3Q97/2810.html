To recap:<br>
<p>
Hall Finney:<br>
<p>
It may be that a super-mind does find it convenient or necessary to<br>
give<br>
its sub-parts a certain amount of autonomy, similar to Minsky's model<br>
of our minds as a society of interacting subsystems.  There could still<br>
be disagreement or conflict among the parts as to the best division of<br>
resources, just as we in our own minds sometimes have trouble making<br>
choices between conflicting possibilities.<br>
<p>
Forrest:<br>
    <br>
I am not convinced that a Jupiter Brain style SI can retain a single<br>
identity over its extended structure. If its 'seat of consciousness'<br>
is <br>
distributed over a volume of space (perhaps in the interest of<br>
redundancy), a 'center' (C1) at one point will diverge by deltaC in<br>
time deltaT from a 'center' (C2) at another point. <br>
If the signal propagation delay (deltaT) is long enough, C2 might have <br>
evolved a will and outlook too different from C1's to be considered<br>
the same SI. I think this effect make the development of a<br>
planet-wide, single identity SI very complicated, a Solar System-wide<br>
SI very unlikely, and a star-spanning SI impossible.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
   I have to agree with Forrest on this point.  I find a Jupiter Size<br>
SI<br>
unlikely from an economic sense.  An appropriate analogy might be to<br>
compare a decentralized market (ours) vs a centralized market (old<br>
Soviet Union).  If you have two jupiter size brains, one that is an SI<br>
and the other that is a vast decentralized network of smaller<br>
identities (a communidentity, sociodentity?), the decentralized<br>
network will more likely yield greater complexity and memetic<br>
evolution from a much greater diversity of identity viewpoints.<br>
 <br>
 The interesting thing here, is that as an in(dividual) who has the<br>
ability to cut and paste any part of their self with any other in this<br>
network - what becomes of our definition of identity?  Are we<br>
then liquidenties (liquid + entity/identity)?<br>
 <br>
