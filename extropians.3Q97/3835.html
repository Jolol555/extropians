<i>&gt;Derek Strong aka Derek Ryan:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm not positive that "never initiate force" works as a complete definition</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the libertarian philosophy, but it seems like a pretty good</i><br>
<i>&gt;generalization.  </i><br>
<p>
Agreed.  It works as a good short definition of libertarian philosophy, but<br>
you can posit sufficiently convoluted situations such that I, for one, would<br>
violate it.<br>
<p>
For example, suppose I was on a train and heard about some nut running<br>
through it who was shooting randomly.  He bursts into the car I'm riding in<br>
and begins shooting. The man next to me is carrying a gun, but happens to be<br>
a rabid anti-gun fanatic who is bringing in the weapon to the local police<br>
gun round-up she-bang, and he refuses my polite request to borrow his gun.<br>
It is his property. I will be initiating force against him if I take it from<br>
him by force. Strictly following the no-inititation of force rule could get<br>
me killed. I may decide to grab his gun, shoot the crazed nut (not the<br>
anti-gun fanatic), and offer to reimburse him for his bullets. I'll take my<br>
chances with the jury if he presses charges.  I think Nozic (sp?) goes into<br>
cases like this in "Anarchy, State and Utopia", but he uses invading tanks<br>
screened by captured hostages.<br>
<p>
"Never initiate force" may be like Newtonian physics, it works as a good<br>
approximation in the everyday world, but may not give the right answers in<br>
atypical situations.<br>
<p>
