Tony, I don't know if this retired admiral said specifically that he wanted<br>
to get a single huge fax from you, but I would feel remiss in my (admittedly<br>
self-assigned) duties as a communication facilitator if I didn't mention that<br>
I found your post very difficult to read -- I almost gave up when it went<br>
on for paragraphs without saying what the twelve track parallel plan was<br>
*for*.  I encountered a further hurdle when the numbers weren't identified<br>
([TRACK 1] instead of just [1], expecially since there's another [1] nested<br>
in one of the items).  I encountered another by not seeing the list of<br>
titles at the front of the document so I could get an idea of its structure<br>
before I started.  And I finally gave up when I had to skip to the end of<br>
each item to try to get an idea what it was about, so I had some context<br>
in which to put the quotation (sometimes it helped more than others).  And<br>
I couldn't really see what the section on science had to do with<br>
disarmament.<br>
<p>
In any case, I'm willing to believe that I am atypical, but while your<br>
concept may be sound, interesting, even vital, I couldn't make it through<br>
your message.  I hope not to offend, just to expand your audience.<br>
<p>
Recall that people can remember and process more information if it's<br>
chunked.  I guess my main point is that I didn't see enough chunking.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Kennita<br>
