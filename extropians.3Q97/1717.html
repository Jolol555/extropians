&lt;&lt; &gt;     So, as we reach a period in human civilization where novelty will <br>
<i> &gt;     exponentially increase and great change will happen in a cosmological </i><br>
<i> &gt;     flicker, what signs are apparent that women are maneuvering into their</i><br>
<p>
<i> &gt;     ascendant positions to take on a more controlling interest in human </i><br>
<i> &gt;     affairs? </i><br>
 <br>
 I thought we was already there.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Its my favorite theory, that time/novelty will come to a climax/end in 2012,<br>
based on the Mayan calendar and a model of time based on the I-ching by<br>
Terrence Mckenna.  Terrence developed the time model without the knowledge of<br>
the Mayans end date and got it to the day, December 21(?) the winter solstice<br>
when the sun rises to allign with the galactic center.  <br>
     Since the beginning of time novelty in the universe has been incresing<br>
exponentially, the complexity of matter has been getting faster and faster,<br>
and there's no reason why this should stop.  You can see it spanned over the<br>
universe within the last millions of years and through the development of man<br>
and our develepments, its continuous, and leading to something. <br>
<p>
there's a mailing list that talks about this, its very good, they talk about<br>
a lot of things: www.levity.com/eschaton/novelty.html<br>
<p>
also check out Terrence's site: <a href="http://deoxy.org/mckenna.htm">http://deoxy.org/mckenna.htm</a><br>
