<p>
I discussed this with Erik Möller a year back. The conclusion (at<br>
least from my point of view, I think Erik disagrees) was that even a<br>
government with nanotech trying to keep the technology under control<br>
would be at a severe disadvantage to disgruntled nanotechnologists,<br>
industrial spies, nerds in basements reading Nanosystems and current<br>
research journals etc; the measures needed to keep everybody in line<br>
would simply turn into a balooning police state with no certainty<br>
that it ever would work (see _The Bohr Maker_ by Nagata for a good<br>
illustration of this scenario).<br>
<p>
The main problem isn't nuclear weapons and other stuff that needs big<br>
technological bases or controllable ingredients, like (say) <br>
antimatter (a lot of energy is needed, and likely a big accelerator),<br>
but the mass destruction weapons that can be made in secret, using<br>
hard-to-trace ingredients. I can easily get enough ammonium nitrate<br>
to become very dangerous, but I doubt it would be as simple for me to<br>
get the ingredients for nerve gas - the latter chemicals are watched,<br>
while ammonium nitrate is commonly used. The same goes for nanotech<br>
weapons, bioweapons and other stuff we fortunately haven't thought of<br>
yet. It is likely it will be extremely hard to avoid proliferation of<br>
them. <br>
<p>
The problem is that most systems of control can only decrease the<br>
likeliehood that mass destruction weapons are used, and as world<br>
population and technological abilities increase the risk of somebody<br>
somewhere using them. If you hunt the weapons maker, they will become<br>
more secret. Making people less inclined to use them is a better<br>
idea; but unless 100% of humanity becomes very nice and sane (or<br>
brainwashed) there will always be some kooks somewhere. The other way<br>
to motivate people not to use weapons of mass destruction is of<br>
course the threat of being annihilated. If a weapon can be traced<br>
back, then this threat may work. Even MAD has a certain power<br>
(*everybody* has nukes, and if you use one they will start to fly),<br>
but in a sufficiently large population there will be people deranged<br>
enough to ignore that too. So we are back at square one: we can make<br>
mass destruction weapons less likely, but we cannot be sure there are<br>
no nutcases who will not care about the consequences.<br>
<p>
I think the best way to deal with this is to try to minimize the<br>
risks, while making sure that if something awful happens you can deal<br>
with it: in a nanotech world, I would invest in active shields<br>
(several of them, and tweak them to be slightly different frome<br>
everybdoy else's), in a world with plenty of biotech I would make<br>
sure I had connections to people with good medical knowledge (CDC?)<br>
and so on. Not ideal, but perhaps the best we can get. <br>
