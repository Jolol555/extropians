I have found that mathematical argumentation herein maximizes <br>
insertion of the fuzzy memetic code, such that resistance to <br>
fuzzy approximates 0%.  This is both my experience and that <br>
of the vast majority of other "fuzzy approximation units," <br>
i.e., bio-logical fuzzy processors that are like you.<br>

<p>
 While the physical facts are always <br>
 100% true, our statements about them <br>
 may be true, more or less. Fuzzy logic<br>
 measures the degree of "more or less."<br>
 For example:<br>
<p>
 THE STATEMENT  "the glass is full" about <br>
  a glass of water that is 70% full can be <br>
  thought of as a set, S, with ten members:<br>
<p>
  S = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}<br>
<p>
  where each member is a 10% portion of the<br>
  glass's volume that is filled with water.<br>
<p>
 THE GLASS,  which in reality is only 70% <br>
  filled with water, is the set, G, such that:<br>
<p>
  G = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}<br>
<p>
  where, like S, each member is a 10% portion of <br>
  the glass's volume that is filled with water.<br>
<p>
  The intersection of S and G = G, therefore<br>
  seven members of S correspond to the truth,<br>
  to the physical reality. ERGO: S has a truth <br>
  value of 70%, or: t(S) = .7 where 100% = 1.<br>
<p>
  Aristotle claims: t(S) = 0<br>
<p>
  which is an inferior conclusion where we want <br>
  our conclusions to maximize the standard of <br>
  a one-to-one correspondence between statement <br>
  X and physical fact. IF truth = physical fact, <br>
  THEN a fuzzy-truth-value standard maximizes the <br>
  truthfulness, or accuracy, of logical mapping.<br>
<p>
  I believe that Aristotle's outcome above is <br>
  0% true because G is a subset of S by 100%.<br>
<p>
<p>
And now for some random noise:<br>
<p>
Resistance to fuzzy is futile. All nonfuzzy memetic <br>
codes will crumble. Surrender to fuzzy or, like bad stuff...<br>
<p>
There may be a correlation between bivalent memetic codes <br>
and social aggression, expressed perhaps most clearly in <br>
the "us" versus "them" conflict, either 100% friend or <br>
100% enemy, 100% good or 100% evil... ergo: aggression.<br>
Maximal fuzzy memetic insertion may maximize social peace.<br>
