If you look at the beginning of Genesis, the sequence of events<br>
is exactly they way evolution went.  First, light - the big bang,<br>
radiation, photons.  Then the stars and planets.  Then water on<br>
earth.  Then plants and animals.  Finally, human beings.<br>
The word "day" in many places in the Bible refers to years and<br>
eras.  A puzzle is why God rested on the seventh "day".<br>
This was to set an example for humanity of having a Sabbath,<br>
with is on the seventh day, Saturday (the Christians moved it<br>
to Sunday, though a few still observe the seventh day).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Well, given faith, the one with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; right answer is the one that has more evidence ro make the argument.</i><br>
<p>
No.  Knowledge consists of theory and evidence together.<br>
Evidence alone does not create theory.<br>
Try this experiment.  Draw three dots on a sheet of paper.<br>
Now draw a line connecting them.  The line is your theory.<br>
I can draw a different line connecting the dots.<br>
That's my theory.  There are an infinite number of thoeries<br>
that are consistent with the dots.<br>
Evidence *tests* theory.  It does not create theory.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That's Darwin, you think? </i><br>
<p>
There are a lot of unanswered questions with Darwinianism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why is God not on this list?</i><br>
<p>
How do you know God is not on this list, under some alias?<br>
