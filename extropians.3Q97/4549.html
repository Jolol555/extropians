<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;But there can also be cultural quantum jumps that doesn't involve new</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;physical technology, such as the introduction of mind-maps, modern</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;book indexing (which increases usability immensely) or the introduction</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;of new notations in science.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I would call mind-mapping a technology, not a sub-culture. But then,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the border between technology and culture is fuzzy. Is transhumanism</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a culture or a technology? Or is it just information?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would say technology is the stuff we use to acieve various ends,</i><br>
<i>&gt; usually our perceived wants. Culture is larger, it includes all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; stuff we do and think, even if it has no real "use". The line can</i><br>
<i>&gt; be quite fuzzy.</i><br>
<p>
There has been significant scholarship on the linkage between<br>
technologies and social development. Since most new technology prior to<br>
the industrial revolution was weapons oriented, it has been easy to see<br>
how advances in weaponry have forced cultures to evolve. Guns have been<br>
widely credited with nailing the coffin on individual aristocratic power<br>
by might of arms.<br>
<p>
The present internet is also seen as the great democratizer of media and<br>
propaganda, which is slowly putting  the ideas of majority tyranny,<br>
political aristocracy, and multinational control of media sources to<br>
bed.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What I'm trying to suggest is that a medium can contain cultural</i><br>
<i>&gt; artifacts, which in turn can contain other systems. For example</i><br>
<i>&gt; the technology television supports the cultural world of television</i><br>
<i>&gt; programs, of which some might act as specialized media for more</i><br>
<i>&gt; specialized cultural activities (like newsprograms, which are</i><br>
<i>&gt; the medium for television news reporting).</i><br>
