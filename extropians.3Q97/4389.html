Hi!<br>

<p>
If errors are caused to the DNA during life itself, it's because the<br>
cell's DNA repair is not working well. What I see is an error in the<br>
piece(s) of DNA that codes the repair procedures of the cell, this must<br>
be fixed, and the errors that appear during life itself are a result of<br>
this inherited error.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Question : Exactly what kind of error's are you having in mind ?</i><br>
<p>
I wish I had an answer but unfortunately no-one on earth knows for sure.<br>
IMHO, there are many genetic errors that affect us after our sexual<br>
peek, they could be a lot of things. Ever hear of the telomerase theory?<br>
There are others, personally I think that if only one error would be the<br>
cause for aging, natural selection would already have solved our aging<br>
problem. See my "Why are We Allowed to Age?" article for more on the<br>
evolution of aging at:<br>
<a href="http://homepage.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/science/why.htm">http://homepage.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/science/why.htm</a><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The "error's" present in the original DNA are not the only causes </i><br>
<i>&gt; of aging. In most cases other contributions are more important :</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) For part of the biochemical processes in the cell the use of </i><br>
<i>&gt; free-radicals is essential. Because biochemical processes </i><br>
<i>&gt; are largely determined by statistics (movements of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; reagents are not controlled but are random), free-radicals </i><br>
<i>&gt; can drift to places where they can do harm. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) Damage created by radiation (high energy photons or </i><br>
<i>&gt; particle radiation)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3) The buildup of harmful wasteproducts which are not completely</i><br>
<i>&gt; removed by the processes in the cell</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 4) Maybe I forgot a few other causes ..... ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; All these result in :   </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	-damage to the DNA coding (possibly creating a cancer cell)</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	-creation of unwanted cross-bonds</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	-damage rendering proteins non-functional</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However biology is using ways to fight this damage by repair </i><br>
<i>&gt; mechanisms. Proteins and other cell-parts are constantly </i><br>
<i>&gt; replaced. The DNA is checked for error's which are corrected. But</i><br>
<i>&gt; these processes are however not capable (by design!) of correcting </i><br>
<i>&gt; all the damage. Gradually the accumulating damage is rendering </i><br>
<i>&gt; the complete cell non-functional (aging of the body).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Therefore (cell-) aging cannot be prevented by only "correcting" </i><br>
<i>&gt; the "errors" that were present in the original DNA.</i><br>
<p>
Error's occur in all cells, radiation damages the DNA, mutations happen<br>
naturally, free radicals can do damage, etc. However, the cell must be<br>
prepared to deal with these problems. For example, I read recently that<br>
the cells of animals that appear not to age, are more efficient at<br>
dealing with free radicals, they have more powerful anti-oxidants. <br>
I understand what you're trying to say, aging is not because of a few<br>
naughty genes but because of our original's design incapacity to deal<br>
with many of life's situations. I agree, actually I think that our<br>
positions are pretty close, when you write, "redesigning the DNA", I bet<br>
it's not much different than when I talk about correcting errors. Please<br>
note that when I write "correcting errors", I include correcting natural<br>
functions that are not working properly - such as anti-oxidants. Where I<br>
think we might not agree is when I claim that our cells have the DNA not<br>
to age (germ and cancer cells are a good example) and with genetic<br>
engineering we can make the right genes active and turn our somatic<br>
cells into immortal cells.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Actually, till now, I was automatically assuming the immortality </i><br>
<i>&gt; of each cell to be necessary for immortality of the body. But </i><br>
<i>&gt; ofcourse this is not required. Non-functional cell's can be </i><br>
<i>&gt; replaced by new cell's. However for extreme immortality this </i><br>
<i>&gt; process will not do away with all damage, because damaged DNA </i><br>
<i>&gt; will be transferred to the new cell's. After a long enough </i><br>
<i>&gt; period (a thousand years?) this will result in all cell's having </i><br>
<i>&gt; error's in their DNA.</i><br>
<p>
Cells can only divide a limited amount of times (did you knew this?),<br>
long before a thousand years, cells will run out of divisions and<br>
eventually die.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; For example, the cells do correct error's in their DNA. They do this </i><br>
<i>&gt; by comparing the opposing bases of the DNA helices. But if the damage </i><br>
<i>&gt; is so extensive that a complete basepair is damaged beyond recognision, </i><br>
<i>&gt; this process will not be able to correct the error. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However MNT will be able to (easily) repair even this damage. </i><br>
<i>&gt; It will just compare the DNA from several separate neighboring </i><br>
<i>&gt; cells! There is no existing biological process which can do this. </i><br>
<i>&gt; That is why I claim that to reach immortality (using only </i><br>
<i>&gt; genetic code altering) the DNA has to be completely redesigned. </i><br>
<i>&gt; (Because new, more extensive, repair processes are required.)</i><br>
<p>
Actually there is a biological process that can do what you propose,<br>
I'll call it, "natural cellular selection". If some cells are badly<br>
damaged and cannot repair themselves, they will die. The neighboring<br>
cells would then have more space, nutrients, water and other resources<br>
to divide. They would then be able to divide more times than normally<br>
and would "occupy" the place of the cells that died, they would replace<br>
them. It's like natural selection in the wild. This happens all through<br>
our live, the big problem is that cells can only divide a limited amount<br>
of times and therefore we will eventually die.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (Ofcourse, nature doesn't want the DNA to be completely fault </i><br>
<i>&gt; resistant, because then natural evolution would stop. This however</i><br>
<i>&gt; is no problem for our human future, because artificial evolution is </i><br>
<i>&gt; much faster than natural evolution.)</i><br>
<p>
I agree completely and I actually mention this in my home page.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And we haven't even discussed diseases caused by bacteria and</i><br>
<i>&gt; viruses. Which can be fought enormously effectively by MNT.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Because the probes build for fighting diseases in the body can </i><br>
<i>&gt; be intelligently controlled, and reprogrammed almost instantly </i><br>
<i>&gt; (by broadcast...) to recognize any new virus or bacterium. </i><br>
<p>
I'm not so optimistic about this, at least in a near future. Have you<br>
ever studied our immune system? It's very complex. Our ability in terms<br>
of creating this "probes" you mention, is still, with my current<br>
knowledge, a long time away in the future. Perhaps one day we can do it<br>
but for the next decades or even centuries we will have to rely on<br>
enhancing our natural defenses and creating a few new simple weapons of<br>
our own (like antibiotics), perhaps giving direct instructions into the<br>
immune system in order to speed the natural process and other procedures<br>
but always having our natural defenses has a landmark. For example, our<br>
immune system recognizes any new virus or bacterium, the problem<br>
sometimes is that the immune response takes too much time. Also,<br>
intelligence means nothing in the world of microorganisms, to fight<br>
millions of virus you don't need intelligence, you need brute force. And<br>
also, why create incredibly complex microscopic machines (which will<br>
surely not be cheap) if there are natural compounds and cells that do<br>
the function well enough? Only when science has advanced so much that<br>
these machines are better than natural "warriors" (which will also<br>
evolve and be artificially enhanced in the future) and that will, IMHO,<br>
only happen in a long time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Why do I think artificial MNT cell-repair machines are easier to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; design? Because you don't have to use DNA gene programming !!</i><br>
<i>&gt; Joa Pedro replied:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;No but you will still have to know what to repair, there are countless</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;errors in our genome each of them creating it's own effect, there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;several defective proteins and you will have to know what these are in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;order to repair them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; When MNT cell-repair machines are used you don't have to alter the </i><br>
<i>&gt; original DNA. The DNA only has to be checked for new error's caused </i><br>
<i>&gt; by damage. Unwanted crossbonds have to be detected and removed. And</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-functional proteines have to be recognized and repaired. This </i><br>
<i>&gt; should render the cell completely "healthy" again.</i><br>
 <br>
I see, like in a sinking boat, instead of filling the hole, you<br>
constantly throw water out of it. Well, as long as it keeps the boat<br>
floating, it's a great idea. The question is, is it easier and/or<br>
quicker than genetic engineer?<br>
Anyway, I think you've missed my point. What I was trying to say is that<br>
for MNT cell-repair machines to act, they will have to know where and<br>
against what to act (how to tell normal from mutant proteins). To know<br>
this, cytogerontology, microbiology and other life sciences must<br>
discover them. Therefore MNT cell-repair machines are dependent on<br>
cytogerontology, microbiology, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Joa Pedro replied:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;MNT is highly dependent on microbiology to achieve</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the purpose you propose.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, there are different pathways for developing MNT. Personally</i><br>
<i>&gt; I guess the microbiology pathway is more complicated and therefore less</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely to succeed first, I favor the STM/AFM pathway. However </i><br>
<i>&gt; it also seems likely that a hybrid approach can be used.</i><br>
<p>
A hybrid, you mean with both biological and artificial materials? Like a<br>
microscopic Robocop, part man, part machine? Sounds interesting, there<br>
are applications of MNT in many areas of general biology, my main<br>
problem with them is that I think, with my current knowledge, MNT will<br>
take longer to appear than you think. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;As a conclusion, I think MNT might also play a role in achieving life</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;extension, to repair the damage done to our cells, perhaps even to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;change our genes (gene therapy is still not achieving great results</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;lately) but the ultimate way to achieve life extension is by correcting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;our DNA.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That depends on what you consider ultimate. However I still claim that </i><br>
<i>&gt; you will have to redesign the complete DNA.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps I haven't made myself clear, like I mention before, correcting<br>
errors includes making the cell's repair procedures more efficient. I<br>
think I didn't explain this point very accurately in my last message and<br>
that is why I am concentrating on it, so there are no doubts about my<br>
intentions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I hope you will see that MNT is the best (only feasible) pathway </i><br>
<i>&gt; to real immortality.</i><br>
<p>
No, because, like I mention before, as far as I know, it will take much<br>
longer to produce an machine that prevents aging rather than preventing<br>
aging with genetic engineering or other biological procedures.<br>
For example, why create artificial enzymes if there are natural ones<br>
that work? In the same line of reasoning, why create machines to prevent<br>
aging if there are natural ways to do the same? It's a waste of time and<br>
resources. Perhaps you can give me a few examples of present<br>
applications of MNT? Give me some real work, some real nano-machines<br>
that can, in a near future, do what you propose. I can do that for the<br>
path for reaching immortality I which to follow (immortal cells, gene<br>
therapy, genetic engineering, mapping of aging genes, etc).<br>
