<p>
    Dear Admiral Gayler,                              30 September, 1997<br>
<p>
<p>
    Again, thank you so much for speaking with me when I've telephoned you from <br>
    Bristol, England at your home in Alexandria over the last couple <br>
    of years.  I really enjoy our conversation so much -- a <br>
    dream come true (for me, anyway!).  Magic!!!  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
    A word on methodology: my approach to problem-solving is basically <br>
    that of Karl Popper; and more particularly, Imre Lakatos' <br>
    proposals in his "The Methodology of Scientific Research <br>
    Programmes" (Cambridge, [1978]).  These are among the most <br>
    powerful and effective instruments of intellectual weaponry I<br>
    know of.  I sent you Bryan Magee's wonderful little book "Popper" <br>
    as a gift from me to you; and to 'repay forward' the work you've <br>
    done already for peace with freedom.<br>
<p>
<p>
    [ I have to admit to sometimes 'speaking through quotations': if <br>
    others say what I want said better than I can say it, 'let them <br>
    fly'! ]<br>
<p>
<p>
    I *don't* start from the problems of the _specific means of <br>
    warfare, important though these are (especially nuclear weapons). <br>
    With Heisenberg, I don't think these are the basic -- or even the <br>
    worst -- problem:  My primary concern is with 'The Causes of War' <br>
    (see Geoffrey Blainey's classic academic  text of this name, publ. <br>
    Sun Books, Melbourne). Blainey's view (following analysis of <br>
    several hundred wars from 1700 to 1971) amounts to the conclusion<br>
    that wars arise as a result of faulty intelligence evaluations of <br>
    one's own or the other side's interests, aims, strengths and will <br>
    to fight; wars "usually begin when two [or more] nations disagree <br>
    on their relative strength, and wars usually cease when the <br>
    fighting nations agree on their relative strength."<br>
<p>
<p>
    And I think the problems of disarmament can actually be more <br>
    readily resolved long-term by something like the twelve-track <br>
    strategy I outline here, with the tracks running separately yet <br>
    simultaneously, more or less in parallel (an Integrated <br>
    Operational Plan for worldwide peace with freedom, if you like!).<br>
    <br>
    Such a plan incorporates specific advances to general nuclear<br>
    disarmament, while (hopefully) avoiding the dangers of open-ended <br>
    non-nuclear warfare.  Its central focus is upon what we're <br>
    fighting for -- and against -- and the means by which we fight; <br>
    and upon the human and material costs.<br>
<p>
<p>
    Still, there are indeed 'no final moves'!<br>
<p>

TITLE: "William Hood on war"<br>
<p>
TEXT:  "Like war, spying is a dirty business.  Shed of its alleged glory, a<br>
soldier's job is to kill.  Peel away the claptrap of espionage and the spy's<br>
job is to betray trust.  The only justification a soldier or a spy can have is<br>
the moral worth of the cause he represents."<br>
<p>
    William Hood was deputy to James Jesus Angleton, legendary Director <br>
    of CIA counterintelligence; 'Mole' p. 11;  publ. Weidenfeld's [1982].<br>
    I've discussed various problems with William Hood very recently.  <br>
    He's contactable through the AFIO.<br>
<p>
                      ----------- * * * * * -----------<br>
<p>
<p>
[01] TITLE: 'Values as the expression of the central order'<br>
<p>
TEXT:  'The problem of values is nothing but the problems of our acts, <br>
goals and morals.  It concerns the compass by which we must steer our <br>
ship if we are to set a true course through life. The compass itself <br>
has been given different names by various religions and philosophies <br>
... but I have a clear impression that all such formulations try to <br>
express man's relatedness to a central order.   In the final analysis <br>
the central order, or the 'One' as it used to be called with which we <br>
commune in the language of religion, must win out....<br>
<p>
  If we ask Western man what is good, what is worth striving for and <br>
what has to be rejected, we shall find time and again, that his <br>
answers reflect the ethical norms of Christianity even when he has <br>
long since lost all touch with Christian images and parables. If the <br>
magnetic force which has guided this particular compass - and what <br>
else was its source but the central order? - should ever become <br>
extinguished, _terrible_ things may happen to mankind, far<br>
more terrible even than concentration camps and atom bombs.'<br>
<p>
<p>
    Werner Heisenberg, [1971] 'Physics and beyond: encounters and<br>
conversations', published by George Allen and Unwin, London.<br>
<p>
<p>
    Thorpe is emphatic in asserting that we must never forget that such a<br>
conclusion must on no account be attributed solely to the Western insights<br>
stemming from the Christian revelation; he gives the following Admonitions as a<br>
further example, drawn from the Amerindian tribe of the Shawnees (who were<br>
dispossessed of their Oklahoma lands in 1839).<br>
<p>
<p>
TITLE: The Shawnee Admonitions:<br>
<p>
TEXT: (1)  "Do not kill or injure your neigbour, for it is not him you injure,<br>
you injure yourself."<br>
<p>
      (2)  "Do not wrong or hate your neighbour, for it is not him that you<br>
wrong, you wrong yourself.  Moneto, the Supreme Being. loves him also as she<br>
loves you."<br>
<p>
  Quoted from W.H. Thorpe, 'Purpose in a World of Chance' Oxford [1978].<br>
  A Biologist's View. George, Allen and Unwin.<br>
<p>
<p>
    This is clearly related via the central order to the (negative) <br>
Judaic injunction not to do unto one's neighbour that which one would <br>
not wish to befall one's self.  My own -- perhaps agnostic -- <br>
orientation is nearer Taoism [and Greek mythology]; but these ethical <br>
principles are capable of reformulation for most spiritual -- and even <br>
humanistic or 'atheistic' -- contexts.<br>

[02] TITLE: "The Role of the Sciences"<br>
<p>
TEXT:  I am constantly reminded of the role of the Newtonian <br>
foundations in Kantian ethics.  I do think that the near-destruction <br>
of 'Classical Physics' was a tragedy that broke the self-confident -- <br>
Kantian -- foundations of 19th Century liberal optimism and rational <br>
expectations of a better future, and further opened the door to the <br>
barbarism of Prussian militarism, aggressive racial nationalism, <br>
Marxism and National Socialism in the 20th Century.<br>
<p>
    I've spent much of the last 10 years working on a Scientific <br>
Research Programme which is founded on an extended Classical <br>
Mechanics, which replaces Special Relativity and General Relativity <br>
and Quantum Mechanics with an intelligible and accurate integrated <br>
Scientific Research Programme -- Relational Mechanics -- which can be <br>
stated on a sheet of A4 paper.  Here's the 'Core Programme' of <br>
Relational Mechanics:  There's an accompanying 120K file which closely <br>
argues for the programme on a positive 'balance-sheet' heuristic of <br>
clarity, simplicity and accuracy in description, explanation and <br>
prediction.   'Physics demystified!'  &gt;:-}<br>

<p>
TITLE: A Scientific Research Programme of Relational Mechanics<br>
<p>
TEXT: The basis of Relational Mechanics is the single principle, that <br>
the laws of physics have the same form in all frames of reference in <br>
uniform translation, and are the same everywhere. It extends Classical <br>
Mechanics into the realms presently occupied by Special and General <br>
Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.<br>
<p>
 Dimensional Analysis of Measure Ratios: Mass = M.  Length = L.  Time = T.<br>
<p>
 [1] MATTER IN INFINITE SPACE: Material objects having extension exist <br>
in a space which is without intrinsic properties, and which exists to <br>
infinity in every direction.<br>
<p>
 [2] UNIFORM TIME WITH UNIVERSAL SIMULTANEITY: The elapsing of time is <br>
uniform and unidirectionally forward, with an instantaneous present <br>
time which occurs at the same time - simultaneously - everywhere. <br>
Signal intervals can be calculated to achieve corrected accurate <br>
predictive and retrodictive data.<br>
<p>
[3] EQUIVALENT GALILEAN RELATIVITY: All forces, material coordinate <br>
positions and velocities are relational; and all co-ordinate systems <br>
or frames of reference in uniform motion relative to one another are <br>
Galileian systems.  There is no privileged or "absolute" reference <br>
frame.  There is full addition of velocities across co-ordinate <br>
systems or reference frames.<br>
<p>
<p>
 [4] GENERALIZATION OF THE LAWS OF MECHANICS: All the laws of <br>
 mechanics have the same form in every inertial frame of reference or <br>
 coordinate system.<br>
<p>
 [5] CLASSICAL MECHANICS: INERTIA: The stasis or movement of anything does not<br>
change unless and until a force acts upon it.<br>
<p>
 [6] CLASSICAL MECHANICS: ACTION: A change in movement of anything is<br>
proportional to the force acting upon it, and is made in the direction <br>
of the force which acts upon it.  (f = ma = ML/T^2; Force = mass times <br>
acceleration).<br>
<p>
 [7] CLASSICAL MECHANICS: REACTION: For every action, there is an equal<br>
reaction in the opposite direction.  (f1 = -f2).<br>
<p>
 [8] RELATIONAL GRAVITATIONAL FORCE: The relational gravitational <br>
 attraction between massy objects is proportional to the sum of their <br>
 masses, and is proportional to the inverse square of the distance <br>
 between their centres of mass.  If gravitational force should prove <br>
 to be propagated at a finite rate, and objects be moving radially <br>
 relative to each other, then the additional velocity-dependent <br>
 modification for propagated spherical forces, Woldemar<br>
 Voight's [1887] equations (later known as "Lorentz Transformations") <br>
 would be required, as a first approximation to non-linear equations <br>
 for delayed interaction over a distance.<br>
<p>
 [9] RELATIONAL ELECTRIC FORCE: The relational electric attraction or <br>
repulsion between charged objects is inverse-square proportional to <br>
the distance between them.  If electric force proves to be propagated <br>
at a finite rate, and objects be moving relative to each other, then <br>
the additional velocity-dependent modification for propagated <br>
spherical forces, Woldemar Voight's [1887] equations (later known as <br>
"Lorentz Transformations") is required, as a first approximation to <br>
non-linear equations for delayed interaction over a distance.<br>
<p>
    Coulomb's Law and Voight's equations yield Maxwell's equations <br>
without further assumptions, as proved by Leigh Page, Yale Professor <br>
of Mathematical Physics [1912] and [1913].<br>

<p>
 [10] RELATIONAL MAGNETIC FORCE: The relational magnetic attraction or<br>
repulsion between north and south magnets is inverse-square <br>
proportional to the distance between them.  If magnetic force proves <br>
to be propagated at a finite rate, and objects be moving radially <br>
relative to each other, then the additional velocity-dependent <br>
modification for propagated spherical forces, Woldemar Voight's [1887] <br>
equations (later known as "Lorentz Transformations") would be <br>
required, as a first approximation to non-linear equations for delayed<br>
interaction over a distance.<br>
<p>
    The [static] lines of magnetic force follow from the force <br>
interactions described by Poisson's equations.<br>

<p>
 [11] QUANTIZED MASS AND ENERGY VALUE OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION:<br>
Electromagnetic structures which are radiated and absorbed ('photons') <br>
have intrinsic mass, and this mass occurs in in multiples of a minimum <br>
mass.  This mass, when in linear translation and with up to three axes <br>
of classical rotation, ('spins') as well as three degrees of <br>
vibration, gives rise to quantum effects.  Such electromagnetic <br>
structures ('photons') are made from the same material as other forms <br>
of matter - negatively charged microparticles (which we can call <br>
electrinos); positively-charged microparticles, (which we may call <br>
positrinos).  There are also neutral microparticles, (presently called<br>
neutrinos).<br>
<p>
 In free space the velocity of emittance of a radiated photon <br>
 _relative to its source_ is constant at L/T = 299,792.485 + or - <br>
 .0012 km/second.<br>
<p>
 E = hv, where E is the energy value of the photon; v is its <br>
 frequency; and h is Planck's constant, which has the measure-ratio of <br>
 ML^2/T, and is presently calculated as 6.6262 x 10^-34 Joules/second. <br>
 There is accordingly a lower as well as an upper limit to photon <br>
 size.  Relevant equations may be found in R.A. Waldron, [1977] and <br>
 [1982].<br>
<p>
 These quantized electromagnetic structures, in conjunction with <br>
 Beckmann's [1987] theory of electron orbits, provide the basis for <br>
 developing the quantized dynamics of particle systems, including <br>
 atoms and molecules.<br>

conservation of energy over time; and full conservation of momentum. <br>
Mass is invariant with respect to relative velocities, as are length <br>
and time.<br>

[03] TITLE: "The Role of Philosopy in the Furtherance of Open Societies"<br>
<p>
    Popper's "The Open Society and Its Enemies" is a basic text, as is <br>
his [1994] "The Myth Of the Framework."  Tarski's Correspondence <br>
theory of truth is central; and Lakatos and Musgrave [1976] is also <br>
'essential reading', as is John Hospers' fine book 'An Introduction to <br>
Philosophical Analysis.  And even David Carradine's fine book 'The <br>
Spirit of Shaolin' &lt;smiles&gt;.  [1997: And Immannuel Kant., 'Was ist <br>
Aufklarung?'].<br>

[04] TITLE: "The Role of the Arts"<br>
<p>
TEXT: "They were wrong, and they will always be wrong, those prophets <br>
who say Art will degenerate, will exhaust all conceivable forms, will <br>
die.  It is we who will die; Art will remain.  And shall we -- before <br>
we perish -- manage to understand all its facets and all its purposes?<br>
<p>
    Not everything has a name.  Some things lead us into a realm <br>
beyond words. Art thaws even the frozen, darkened soul, opening it to <br>
lofty spiritual experience.  Through Art we are sometimes sent -- <br>
indistinctly, briefly -- revelations not to be achieved by rational <br>
thought.<br>
<p>
    It is like that small mirror in the fairy-tales -- you glance in <br>
it, and what you see is not yourself: for an instant, you glimpse the <br>
Inaccessible, where no horse or magic carpet can take you.  And the <br>
soul cries out for it..."<br>
<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
      The brilliant American actress Dorothy Jean Seberg, from <br>
Marshalltown, Iowa, (see her in incomparable performances, in Otto <br>
Preminger's 'St. Joan', where -- as a 17-year-old girl -- she was <br>
chosen from 10 000 to play Joan of Arc; and in Robert Rossen's <br>
magnificent film 'Lilith.') was hideously and protractedly killed as a <br>
direct consequence of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's malicious actions <br>
against her.<br>
<p>
      Hoover circulated vicious press stories including one that the <br>
baby she was expecting was of mixed race, and imposed unbearable <br>
pressures on her. She miscarried, and subsequently tried to kill <br>
herself on each anniversity of her lost baby's death.  She was later <br>
found dead in Paris, her body stuffed into a car trunk by the side of <br>
the road).<br>
<p>
     David Richards' biography of Jean Seberg is titled 'Played Out.'<br>
<p>
<p>
    And radical actress Frances Farmer's horrifying autobiography, "Will <br>
There Really Be A Morning?" (filmed as 'Frances' with Jessica Lange. <br>
[1983]) as a truly terrifying public warning of the perils and <br>
consequences of coercive psychiatry.  We _cannot_ allow such <br>
terrorist acts be committed against people anymore.<br>

[05] TITLE: "Realizing Human Potential"<br>
<p>
TEXT:  I'm working intermittently on a -- shareware -- personal <br>
computer multimedia programme which offers some of the benefits of the Human <br>
Potential methods, inexpensively, on a more widespread basis.  There <br>
is quite a lot of interest in such technologies nowadays.  The work of <br>
LTC Jim Channon's 'First Earth Battalion Foundation' is also well <br>
worth a look; as is the generality of work done on the realization of <br>
Human Potential described in Pearson &amp; Shaw's book "Life Extension -- <br>
A Practical Scientific Approach"; and "MegaBrain" by Michael<br>
Hutchison.<br>
<p>
Ms. Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau can make a fine multimedia presenter <br>
and teacher for this programme, and I have asked her to consider <br>
participating in the project.<br>

[06] TITLE: "The Open Society and its Enemies"<br>
<p>
TEXT: Over the years, I've developed a simple political and social <br>
programme -- 'Democratic Agorism' -- which aims to provide both <br>
assessment benchmarks and practical measures to achieve more fully <br>
free and open societies worldwide.  And Open Societies don't war with <br>
each other...<br>
<p>
   Latest revisions of the 'Democratic Agorism'  program available from: <br>
<p>
              <a href="http://www.agora.demon.co.uk">http://www.agora.demon.co.uk</a><br>
<p>
The essential elements of Demopcratic Agorism are modular and synergistic:<br>
<p>
They include:<br>
<p>
[A]  A contractually-based day-by-day electoral system - Vectored Politics<br>
[B]  Full-Liability Personal Indemnity Insurance, enabling full restitution.<br>
[C]  Personal Radio Alarms: for event-driven and customer-driven policing<br>
[D]  A Restitutive Legal System, with online 'courts' and arbitration.<br>
[E]  Good Basic Income Provision for all -- independent incomes for all.<br>
[F]  Networked information services and library facilities<br>
[G]  National Health Insurance chargecard and online diagnostic facilities<br>
[H]  Online education and skills-development facilities<br>
[I]  Tradenet buy/sell/swap/finance/work  transaction services<br>
[J]  Packaged 'political' services provided via elected representatives<br>
<p>
<p>
    If all children (indeed, all of us) had these inexpensive radio <br>
alarms, they would be greatly more secure from all kinds of abuse.  I <br>
have given this idea to Motorola Corporation. If (for instance) <br>
JonBenet Ramsey had bean wearing one, she could have instantly <br>
summoned help, and could be alive today.<br>
<p>
      I am a formal external adviser to the Boulder, Colorado District <br>
Attorney's Office in her case.<br>
<p>
      (What was done to JonBenet Ramsay and to Mary Kay Schmitz <br>
LeTourneau have matching patterns.  See especially the section 'The <br>
Little Fascist' in "What Do You Say After You Say 'Hello'?  The <br>
Psychology of Human Destiny"  by Eric Berne MD).<br>

[07] TITLE: "Wars of Ideas; Wars on Ideas"<br>
<p>
TEXT:  As Popper says ("The Myth Of The Framework"), civilization really <br>
started with the invention of swords.  Civilized and intelligent men <br>
then saw that fighting with words makes better sense, with bad ideas <br>
dying instead of people.<br>
<p>
    So I support wars of ideas waged on behalf of the ideas of the Open<br>
    Society, backed with:<br>
<p>
    Triple-track diplomacy (positive, negative and covert-action);<br>

    Psychological warfare (viz. Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger's <br>

<p>
    Reactive 'Antiweaponry' Defences (Precision-Guided Munitions, <br>
    conventional antiballistic missile systems -- viz. the _original_ <br>
    "High Frontier" ideas in Dan Graham's Heritage Foundation Project <br>
    Book of that name [1982], not the hyped-up SDI stuff that <br>
    dissipated the money and the political support which could have <br>
    built High Frontier's Layered Defense proposals.<br>
<p>
<p>
    I would ask you to please consider the "High Frontier" proposals<br>
    independently of your experience of the late Dan Graham:  I was <br>
    impressed by the way he welcomed a visiting Soviet journalist to a <br>
    High Frontier presentation in London, and emphasised how the US <br>
    and the USSR could work together to block nuclear attack.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Some of our MoD and conservative people were averse to Strategic <br>
    Defense ideas because they feared the nullification of Britain's <br>
    'independent deterrent':  yet our Trident systems rely on American <br>
    know-how for accuracy; and I'll not soon forget my Royal Navy <br>
    friend Peter McManus -- later a 'Top Gun' air combat trainer 'on <br>
    loan' to RAF Valley in the late 'Sixties -- telling me of the <br>
    terse reply they were given at their fighter-bomber mission <br>
    briefing, when someone asked how they were supposed to get 'back <br>
    home' again, when the nuclear targets were at the fighter-bombers' <br>
    limits of range:<br>
<p>
    "What do you think there will be to come home to"?<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
    The aim of my sort of Twelve Track Operational Plan should be<br>
    to fight and win the war of ideas *peacefully* for the Open <br>
    Societies, transforming enemies into friends wherever this may be <br>
    possible.<br>

and resilient 'horizontal' free and equalitarian social orders <br>
envisioned by (most of) the Lockean founders of the American Republic. <br>
(If a quiet patriotism is the love of the _idea_ of a country, I'm <br>

    Lots of Internets, with lots of alternative data-radio and <br>
telecomms providers! Cheap or free powerful and secure personal <br>
computers.  Spontaneous orders then form from the free chices made by <br>
the individual telecommunicators.  David Andrews' excellent book "The <br>
IRG Solution: Hierarchical Incompetence and How To Overcome It" <br>
(Souvenir Press, [1984]) gives good insights into these social <br>
processes and their internal dynamics.<br>

<p>
   TEXT: In 1944, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation ran this magazine<br>
   advertisement,showing a grim pilot, about to take on Zeros at twelve <br>
   o'clock, imagining this staccato message to his wife:-<br>
<p>
      "I want to tell you what I'm fighting for.. it's you and our <br>
  little house and the job I had before... and the chance I had, the <br>
  fighting chance, to go ahead on my own.  That's what all of us want <br>
  out here... to win this war... to get home... To go back to living our <br>
  lives in a land -- and a world -- where *every* man is free to <br>
  grow as great as he's a mind to be...  where *every* man has an <br>
  *unlimited* opportunity to be useful to himself and his <br>
  fellow men ...<br>
<p>
<p>
      "Tell 'em we'll be back... nothing can stop us... And tell 'em no <br>
  matter what they say, no matter what they do... to stay *free*.. to <br>
  keep America a land of *individual freedom*! <br>
<p>
<p>
      _That's_ what we're fighting for... <br>
<p>
      _That's_ what we're willing to die for... <br>
<p>
      _That's_ the America we want when we come home."<br>
<p>
<p>
      So say Mary Kay Schmitz Letourneau and I.  Amen.<br>
<p>
<p>
    ...............<br>

    "We had better figure out what happened if we expect any army,  <br>
     conscript or volunteer,  even to _remember_ what it's fighting for." <br>

      FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was Lee Harvey Oswald's employer of <br>
record at the time of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, <br>
according to evidence given by Texas Attorney-General Waggoner Carr, <br>
who in his sworn testimony provided the Warren Commission with <br>
Oswald's FBI employee number and salary details.  Hoover wrote a day <br>
later that Oswald 'acted alone...'<br>

[12] TITLE: "The Role Of Mythologies"<br>
<p>
    Science fiction has been aptly described as 'The Mythology of the 20th (and<br>
21st) Century.  Foremost among my favourites are Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings'<br>
(in which coercion is the main evil, and individual free will is the foundation<br>
of the principal virtues).  And Cordwainer Smith's incomparable stories (Dr.<br>
Paul Linebarger's nom de plume)<br>
<p>
      And of course the mythology of Classical Greece.]<br>

    I hope you find these ideas worthy of your consideration and further<br>
discussion;  I'm really looking forward to hearing from you!  I'm entirely<br>
happy for you to discuss all this with others if you think it's worthwhile.  I<br>
have no secrets from the Puzzle Palace!! &lt;smile&gt;<br>

TITLE:           *** WELCOME TO 'PHYSICS/GENERAL' ***<br>
<p>
"... seen as the result of human endeavour, of human dreams, hopes, <br>
passions, and most of all, as the result of the most admirable union <br>
of creative imagination and rational critical thought, I should like <br>
to write 'Science' with the biggest capital 'S' to be found in the <br>
printer's upper case.<br>
<p>
<p>
  Science is not only like art and literature, an adventure of the human<br>
spirit, but it is among the creative arts perhaps the most human: full of<br>
human failings and shortsightedness, it shows those flashes of insight<br>
which open our eyes to the wonders of the world and of the human spirit.<br>
But this is not all. Science is the direct result of that most human of all<br>
human endeavours - to liberate ourselves. It is part of our endeavour to see<br>
more clearly, to understand the world and ourselves, and to act as adult,<br>
responsible and enlightened beings. 'Enlightenment', Kant wrote, 'is the<br>
emancipation of man from self-imposed tutelage . . . from a state of in-<br>
capacity to use his own intelligence without external guidance.  Such a<br>
state of tutelage I call "self-imposed" if it is due not to any lack of<br>
intelligence but the lack of courage or determination to use one's own<br>
intelligence instead of relying upon a leader.  *Sapere Aude!*  Dare to use<br>
your own intelligence! This is the maxim of the enlightenment.' [ref. <br>
6, Immanuel Kant, 'Was ist Aufklarung?']<br>
<p>
<p>
  Kant challenges us to use our intelligence instead of relying upon a<br>
leader, upon an authority. This should be taken as a challenge to<br>
reject even the scientific expert as a leader, or even *science itself*<br>
Science has no authority. It is not the magical product of the given,<br>
the data, the observations. It is not a gospel of truth. It is the result<br>
of our own endeavours and mistakes. It is you and I who make science,<br>
as well as we can. It is you and I who are responsible for it...<br>
<p>
<p>
  The nuclear bomb (and possibly also the so-called 'peaceful use of<br>
atomic energy' whose consequences may be even worse in the long run)<br>
have, I think, shown us the shallowness of the worship of science as an<br>
'instrument' of our 'command over nature' or the 'control of our physical<br>
environment': it has shown us that this command, this control, is apt to be<br>
self-defeating, and apt to enslave us rather than to make us free - if it<br>
does not do away with us altogether. And while knowledge is worth dying for,<br>
power is not. (Knowledge is one of the few things that are worth dying for,<br>
together with liberty, love, kindness, and helping those who are in need<br>
of help)."<br>
