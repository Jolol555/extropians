        The main reason for this is simply the association of omnidimensional<br>
ideas (words that are on a flat computer screen) with multidimensional people<br>
and their personalities.  There is usually a lot more to people than can be<br>
transmitted in the words they write...taking into consideration word<br>
inflection, body language and facial movements etc.  In short, a person's<br>
*character* is what carries him beyond his words; Extro-3 was a prime<br>
example of that: though I knew most of the attendees through their writing,<br>
I found myself wanting to "meet" everybody in person --an impossible task<br>
when there are so many to meet!  ;-)<br>
