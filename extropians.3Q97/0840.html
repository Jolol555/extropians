In 'The Bell Curve' is an appendix which claims to explain the tortured<br>
history of using tests (including IQ) as a method of employee selection.  It<br>
would appear that all tests on which blacks score lower than whites on the<br>
average have been banned, as being discriminatory.  This doesn't explain why<br>
IQ scores do not appear on resumes outside the US, however.<br>
<p>
I say 'claims to explain' because I no longer trust 'The Bell Curve' to tell<br>
the balanced truth.  I've seen enough criticism of it to believe that it is<br>
as slanted as possible without actually telling barefaced lies.<br>
