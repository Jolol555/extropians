Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt;,<br>
<p>
	Thanks for the web reference.  I'll have to check it out.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We want to measure the state of a quantum system, and bring that</i><br>
<i>&gt; measurement into the quantum computer, preserving its quantum</i><br>
<i>&gt; nature.</i><br>
<p>
	Your usage of the terms like "bring into" is very vague.  Do<br>
you mean detect and represent in a classical cause and effect way even<br>
though some of the cause/effect and representation and amplification<br>
machinery or whatever might be quantum?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In a classical computer, we will basically absorb the photon, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; measure some of its state.  However, because of the Heisenberg</i><br>
<i>&gt; uncertainty principle, we will inevitably measure only a part of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; state.  Something is always lost.</i><br>
<p>
	But whatever the phenomenon, once it is amplified or detected<br>
enough to represent in any computer, whether quantum or not, why can't<br>
the particular phenomenon be virtually simulated or modeled in a<br>
sufficiently complex classical computer?  How is it that the quantum<br>
machinery doesn't loose the information and clasical machinery losses<br>
it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Today we can bring a photon in and put it into a loop, with</i><br>
<i>&gt; amplifiers,</i><br>
<p>
	My understanding of "amplification" is you use one cause and<br>
effect phenomenon to control in a cause and effect way a completely<br>
different, more powerful, phenomenon.  A transistor uses a few moving<br>
electrons to control the flow of many electrons - hence amplification.<br>
Saying one amplifies a particular physical thing, like a photon,<br>
doesn't make much sense to me.  You can't amplify a single moving<br>
electron, you can just use it to control the movement of many other<br>
electrons.  Can you help me out here?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and preserve most of its state for some fleeting instants.</i><br>
<p>
	By "preserve" do you mean keep the photon in that state, or do<br>
you mean represent the state of the photon with some other, different<br>
and maybe amplified physical phenomenon that detected it's state?<br>
<p>
	This is all over my head so if this is too technical don't<br>
worry about it.  Maybe some day all do the required reeding to<br>
understand more of this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To actually do a lot of calculations on the photon (enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt; simulate a conscious mind!) while preserving the phase and state</i><br>
<i>&gt; information so perfectly will be quite a feat, to say the least!</i><br>
<p>
	I have a real problem with misleading (or ambiguous at best)<br>
statements like this.  We can simulate a few neurons with classical<br>
computers.  Given enough classical computing and observation power we<br>
could, theoretically, simulate, classically, all the neurons and other<br>
relevant machinery in a brain and thereby "simulate a conscious mind"<br>
right?  Are you simply implying that quantum computers will give us<br>
the required computing power to do this?  Or are you talking about<br>
some quantum phenomenon here that clasical computers, no matter how<br>
complex, could never do?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Hope this sheds some light for you -</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, definitely.  Like all things, I guess, more answers<br>
simply produce even more questions.<br>
<p>
		Thanks.<br>
<p>
