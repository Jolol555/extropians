<i>&gt;I fully share John K Clark's confidence in the reliability of the </i><br>
market<br>
<i>&gt;mechanism when its technical requirements are satisfied, but we need to </i><br>
have<br>
<i>&gt;more public discussion on the one big wart that is the mother of all </i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;little warts attributed to the free market by its many opponents.  That </i><br>
big<br>
<i>&gt;wart, IMHO, is the failure of corporations or governments to remove </i><br>
fixed and<br>
<i>&gt;unavoidable costs from the variable cost data used by product lines or</i><br>
<i>&gt;households to price their products and services in a competitive </i><br>
market.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That big wart is very simple, a ten year old can understand it, but has </i><br>
been<br>
<i>&gt;treated as an act of God in the media, in our schools, and on the </i><br>
internet;<br>
<i>&gt;while the industrial nations have rested content with 5-25% </i><br>
unemployment and<br>
<i>&gt;2-3% sustained inflation, since the 1890's.  I don't understand why!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Let's talk about the warts.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'm not 10 years old, and I don't understand what your are talking <br>
about. Your statement:<br>
<p>
'The Big Wart...is the failure of corporations or governments to remove <br>
fixed and unavoidable costs from the variable cost data used by product <br>
lines or households to price their products and services in a <br>
competitive market.' <br>
<p>
..doesn't make sense to my 30 year old brain - could you please <br>
elaborate?<br>
<p>
Paul<br>
