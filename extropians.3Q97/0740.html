[Delayed by the NSI DNS disaster...]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From: Andrea Gallagher &lt;drea@alumni.stanford.org&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; David Friedman has an essay in Machinery of Freedom on a anarcho-capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; education system.  You should check that out, though it's mostly applied to</i><br>
<i>&gt; college.  Personally, I would love to see a world where 18 year olds could</i><br>
<i>&gt; get reasonable jobs without going to annother four years of school.</i><br>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt; So, in an anarchic (or market-like) school, what do you have to show the</i><br>
<i>&gt; employers?  You need something more consise that the entire portfolio of</i><br>
<i>&gt; work, and you'd like something that helps them rank you in relation to</i><br>
<i>&gt; other applicants.</i><br>
<p>
I do lots of interviewing, and frankly I'd love to see a world in<br>
which we ended the idea of degrees. I've seen too many people who knew<br>
what they were doing and had no degrees, and vice versa.<br>
<p>
I rarely even am as concerned about what someone knows as I am with<br>
their work habits and whether they can think. So few people can think<br>
clearly about abstract problems that I'm willing to educate<br>
half-educated employees who can think clearly much more than I'm<br>
willing to hire someone who can do a narrow skilled kind of work but<br>
who can't learn quickly or think well in unusual circumstances.<br>
<p>
When someone goes to get a job in many creative fields, one actually<br>
does bring a (literal) portfolio of one's work to prospective<br>
employers, who examine it and make a decision based on it. I'm not<br>
averse to seeing us return to such things.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The option our federal government like is to create one</i><br>
<i>&gt; Great Standard Tesk of All Knowledge, but that's likely to dictate how</i><br>
<i>&gt; children are made to learn and doesn't help in specialized fields.</i><br>
<p>
On the other hand, we can have private organizations like the<br>
Educational Testing Service construct such things without government<br>
intervention. Such tests may in fact be useful for screening out<br>
riff-raff prior to an interview process, but usually no objective<br>
measure (like GPA or presence of a degree) is good for more than<br>
screening anyway...<br>
