Yet another good reason for eliminating the state which gives them those <br>
extra rights.<br>
<p>

<p>
What about Reich's books? I've never had the chance to read them, but I'd<br>
presume he did a pretty good job. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Example: euthanasia is illegal in most country's, but is becoming accepted</i><br>
<i>&gt; in some and has been practised by the Eskimo's for thousands of years.</i><br>
<p>
I was under the impression that Eskimo 'euthanasia' was much closer to<br>
what we'd call 'murder'; people didn't commit suicide because they were in<br>
horrible pain, but committed suicide or were killed because they were a<br>
drain on the community.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; With a Darwinian Economy I meant an economy without any ethical rules or</i><br>
<i>&gt; law-enforcing organisation (like a state).</i><br>
<p>
Which is a far cry from the kind of anarcho-capitalist or libertarian free<br>
market societies we've talked about here. The *only* difference between<br>
anarcho-capitalism and modern society is that we privatise everything,<br>
including the government and legal system. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm not saying it won't work, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think it would work very well (that was what the post was all about). But I</i><br>
<i>&gt; find the side-effect of such a system much too high.</i><br>
<p>
So by your own definition you're a fascist (you put the interests of the<br>
group above the interests of the individual)? <br>
