<i>&gt; Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt; wrote (a very good account of the standard </i><br>
<i>&gt; response by Everettians to the problem of how to make sense of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; probabilities):</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The idea is that as the state function evolves into a mixture of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; non-coherent states, a measure function can be applied to the various</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; components of the mixture, based on the probability amplitudes.  Everett</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; shows that, in the limit, the probability results observed from a series</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of measurements will match the squared-amplitude of the relative state,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; exactly as required by conventional QM; this is true except in a set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; branches of total measure zero.  So you then only have to assume that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; branches with amplitude zero never exist, and you derive that observed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; probabilities will follow the predictions of conventional QM.  (This is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the basis for DeWitt's claim, since he takes the premise as obvious.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes this is what they say. The problem is that the measure doesn't </i><br>
<i>&gt; seem to correctly represent probabilities, if the world is as the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Everett interpretation says it is. If there is exactly one version of </i><br>
<i>&gt; me in a world where I measure Spin up, say, and exactly one version </i><br>
<i>&gt; of me in a world where I measure Spin down (and no other versions of </i><br>
<i>&gt; me, in this simplified example), then why is it that *this* </i><br>
<i>&gt; version of me usually ends up being the version of me that obtains </i><br>
<i>&gt; the outcome that quantum mechanics says is the most probable one? </i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what you are saying here, in speaking of three different<br>
versions of yourself (the one which measures Spin up, the one which<br>
measures Spin down, and *this* one).<br>
<p>
You may be asking something like the following:  I am about to make<br>
a quantum measurement, which has two possible outcomes, spin up and<br>
spin down.  We have prepared the system so that quantum theory predicts<br>
that the spin up outcome will occur with probability 99%, spin down with<br>
probability 1%.  I make the measurement, and as we know, most of the<br>
time it comes out spin up.<br>
<p>
Yet, in some versions of the many-worlds interpretation, the world is<br>
said to split into two parts when I make the measurement, so afterwards<br>
there are two instances of me where before there was one.  Since there<br>
are two, subjectively there should have been a 50% chance that I would<br>
find myself in one particular one of them.  This contradicts the 99%<br>
chance which I actually observe.<br>
<p>
I may be missing your point in simplifying the argument to this point,<br>
because it does not seem to me to carry much weight.  A priori there<br>
is no more reason to expect the splitting phenomenon to give equal<br>
probabilities to finding yourself in one of the two outcomes than to<br>
give 99% or any other probability.  The mere fact that one went to two<br>
does not imply that the two outcomes have equal measure in any sense.<br>
<p>
Actually, in Everett's paper he did not consider these kinds of discrete<br>
measurements, which lend themselves to these somewhat misleading (IMO)<br>
counting arguments.  He discussed the continuous case, where the measurement<br>
had an infinite number of possible outcomes.  There, it is necessary to<br>
use an integral rather than a simple sum to describe the state function.<br>
And it is natural then to introduce a measure function to weight the<br>
various branches of the state function.  You then derive the probability<br>
of an observed outcome by integrating the measure function over the range<br>
of all parameters which produce that specified outcome.<br>
<p>
A simple counting argument for numbers of worlds can't work if there<br>
are infinite numbers in all classes.  If you want to apply the counting<br>
argument to the continuous case, what you have to do is in effect to come<br>
up with your own measure function, one which is not based on the amplitude<br>
but which is a constant.  It is much less clear in this case that this<br>
measure function is a priori the right one.  Rather, the measure function<br>
to be used must be specified explicitly as part of the interpretation.<br>
<p>
It is not a strong argument to say that the Everett interpration must be<br>
wrong because it uses a different measure function than one which may<br>
strike you as a priori correct.  Bryce De Witt thinks Everett's measure<br>
function is a priori correct!  Both views are mistaken, IMO.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Imagine that at each point of time t we define the set Ct as </i><br>
<i>&gt; containing all time slices of minds that exist at t. Then, as time </i><br>
<i>&gt; goes by, the proportion of mind slices in Ct that would see quantum </i><br>
<i>&gt; mechanical predictions verified experimentally would quickly become </i><br>
<i>&gt; completely negligable; and yet, miraculously,  it constantly turns </i><br>
<i>&gt; out that I am in Ct! The improbabiliy that this should happen is the </i><br>
<i>&gt; improbability that the Everett interpretation is true, if there is no </i><br>
<i>&gt; way to escape this conclusion.</i><br>
<p>
Again, to explain how I interpret this argument, we can consider the<br>
measurement above to be repeated many times.  If you assume that one<br>
split occurs with each measurement, then after, say, 20 measurements,<br>
only the branch which measured spin up every time has high probability.<br>
Yet only one of the 2^20 possible branches is this one.<br>
<p>
As before, the reply is simply that all the branches do not have equal<br>
measure and equal probability.  We must assume that the probability,<br>
the weight, of a branch is measured by the square of the amplitude<br>
associated with that branch.<br>
<p>
As I wrote in my earlier message, this is an additional postulate which<br>
must be added to the strict Schrodinger equation in order to derive<br>
the observed results.  I believe that it is nevertheless much simpler<br>
and more plausible than the projection postulate of conventional QM,<br>
which it replaces.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; (You might think of this as indicating that the "degree of reality" of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a branch is proportional to the square of the amplitude.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But then I want the follower of Everett to explain to me what a </i><br>
<i>&gt; degree of reality is, and more particularly why there is a greater </i><br>
<i>&gt; probability that I should find myself in the world with the higher </i><br>
<i>&gt; "degree of reality", when there are two real worlds and there is one </i><br>
<i>&gt; version of me in one of them and one in the other.</i><br>
<p>
Why ask why?  This must be postulated.  Is it plausible that subjective<br>
probability follows the square of the amplitude?  There are arguments<br>
in favor of it.  Everett showed that the only worlds which would observe<br>
probabilities consistently violating the predictions of QM have amplitude<br>
approaching zero.  I think it is a plausible axiom to suggest that<br>
worlds with amplitude zero are not experienced.  But it is an axiom,<br>
and it is not right to ask "why" it happens.  You might as well ask why<br>
the Schrodinger equation works.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If sense cannot be made of "degrees of reality" (I'm not convinced it </i><br>
<i>&gt; can't, but it's a very deep issue) then, it has been proposed, </i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps we should say that there are a greater *number* of worlds </i><br>
<i>&gt; associated with more probable outcomes. This would solve the problem </i><br>
<i>&gt; of probabilities, but now look at the ontology you have bought into. </i><br>
<i>&gt; You have commited yourself to an *uncountable infinity* of worlds </i><br>
<i>&gt; existing side by side, many of them identical! (Is it even meaningful </i><br>
<i>&gt; to postulate two distinct worlds that are *exactly* similar.) All </i><br>
<i>&gt; simplicity and plausibility seem to have been lost at this stage.</i><br>
<p>
I've seen this suggestion, but I don't think it is economical or necessary.<br>
In my opinion the measure/probability postulate solves the problem<br>
adequately, based on the arguments I described above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The bigger problem with the conventional interpretation IMO is that it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; inconsistent; the two different processes produce different results, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it is not clear exactly when we should use one or the other.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure exactly what you referes to as the "conventional </i><br>
<i>&gt; interpretation". Personally, I (also?) am unhappy with  </i><br>
<i>&gt; interpretations that appeal to the notion of measurement at a </i><br>
<i>&gt; fundamental level. But we must not forget the possibility that </i><br>
<i>&gt; something like the GRW interpretation turns out to be correct, so it </i><br>
<i>&gt; would be all too hasty to jump to something really weird, especially </i><br>
<i>&gt; if it doesn't even work.</i><br>
<p>
I am referring to the "Copenhagen" interpretation, which suggests that<br>
there are two kinds of processes which govern the time evolution of<br>
dynamical systems: in isolation, the system follows the Schrodinger<br>
equation, which describes the deterministic evolution of the state<br>
function; and when measured, the system's state changes discontinuously<br>
and randomly to one of the possible measured values, with probability<br>
based on the square of the amplitude of that value's component in the<br>
state function.<br>
