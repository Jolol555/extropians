I wonder if there exists anything one might call a transhuman technology<br>
mutual fund? I've been keeping up with Nanothinc's Nanoportfolio at<br>
<a href="http://www.nanothinc.com/NanoVentures/WhatsNew/nanoport.html">http://www.nanothinc.com/NanoVentures/WhatsNew/nanoport.html</a> and<br>
conducted a cursory Web search for relevant info, but as yet, I've hit a<br>
dead-end. In general, from a short-term perspective, it may be a good<br>
time to get into tech stocks since the market correction these past few<br>
weeks. Of course, for the long-term, there's a pile of money to be made<br>
in such stocks (money which would expand the ole' future light cone<br>
so-to-speak.)<br>
<p>
I'd appreciate any info from those in the know.<br>
