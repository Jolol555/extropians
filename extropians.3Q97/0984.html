&lt;For a rerun to occur (a being that develops so similar to yourself it<br>

exact in every detail up to the point of your death (so that the being<br>
has the same memories and 'thinks' it is you).&gt;<br>

Hal Finney replied:<br>
&lt;Not at all, you could be created "from scratch" as an exact match of<br>
your current body/mind.  There is no reason why the surrounding world<br>
would have to match.  You would experience a discontinuity if the<br>
external world changed, of course.&gt;<br>
<p>
Cosmology aside, this is precisely what I never understood from _The<br>
Physics of Immortality_: My body/mind is a product of innumerable<br>
interactions with my environment.  How can neural nets, or whatever<br>
Omega might use, spring full-blow like Athena from the head of Zeus<br>
without some kind of interactive growth or training?  How can<br>
‘brute-force resurrection’ create something human-level or greater<br>
*that once existed* ‘from scratch’ without also simulating all the<br>
environmental input factors that conditioned that being?<br>
<p>
Even if there are only x^y states of ‘matter’ possible and infinite<br>
computational resources at Omega could compute all possible<br>
combinations, how could ‘The System’ ever *select* those<br>
configurations that might have had some resemblance to actual history<br>
(which would seem to be required in order to call this a<br>
‘resurrection’)?<br>
