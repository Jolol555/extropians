     A short time ago, I was wandering through the web, and happened to<br>
come across a description of Extropianism. Reading though it, I became<br>
aware that this was something that fit in nicely with my developing<br>
belief structure. After a bit of looking around, I came across the<br>
mailing list, and joined.<br>
     Since that time, I have been sitting here enjoying the view,<br>
listening to the conversations, and feeling the breeze. Now, I still<br>
enjoy the view, and still listen to the conversations, but the wind up<br>
here is getting a little much.<br>
    It seems that I am faced with a choice. Either I can step up the<br>
pace of my self-generation, or I can shave my head to reduce the drag.<br>
The ideas on this list seem to be thrown out fast and furious, and for<br>
someone with little over the 'traditional' high school education (aside<br>
from some specialized industry courses), there is a lot passing by just<br>
above my level.<br>
    Basically, what I am wondering is what areas/books would some of you<br>
consider mandatory reading to help one become a 'whole' person? What are<br>
some of your favorite books? Are there any books you would consider<br>
fundamental introductions to various topics, or laying essential<br>
groundwork?<br>
    I am aware that these are highly individual questions, but I am<br>
trying to get a grasp on what pieces I am missing.<br>
