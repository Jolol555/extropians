This is an objection to the popularized notion of "many worlds" rather<br>
than to Everett's original idea of eliminating state function reduction.<br>
IMO you can't take this "universe splitting" idea that literally.  What I<br>
prefer is to suggest that the effect of the decoherence (and resulting<br>
independence) of branches of the state function is "as though" the universe<br>
were splitting.  But there is only one state function; what changes is<br>
which part of it you can interact with.<br>
<p>
So the problem with counting the "number of worlds" is not really a<br>
serious objection against Everett's ideas.  As I wrote in my other<br>
message, Everett actually worked with the continuous form of the state<br>
function throughout, so he would have had an infinite number of worlds<br>
right off the bat, if he were using that term (he never says "worlds").<br>
<p>
A good, accessible article comparing the popular many-worlds interpretation<br>
with Everett's original relative-state formulation is Am. J. Phys 58 (9),<br>
September 1990, p. 829.  (Am. J. Phys. is a relatively non-technical journal<br>
for physics teachers and students.)  Among the arguments against MW in<br>
the popular form is that it violates conservation of mass, since new<br>
universes are being created all the time.  This is really a matter of<br>
misunderstanding Everett's key idea.<br>
