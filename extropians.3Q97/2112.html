Robin writes-<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[...] many people in our society are literally starving for sex,</i><br>
<i>&gt;at least of the sort that they value. [...]</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I fear that these people are just made to feel worse by</i><br>
<i>&gt;discussion of all the variations beyond their reach.</i><br>
<p>
If the standard types of sex aren't of the sort that one values,<br>
then variations might bring sex-of-the-kind-one-values within<br>
reach.  Or sex of a kind one is capable of psychologically, socially<br>
or, er, whatever.<br>
<p>
But I would still guess that being turned off by standard sex wasn't why<br>
most sex-starved people are.  Unless you count things like embarrassment,<br>
rejection, disease, alienation, psychological warfare within couples,<br>
etc. to be features of standard sex.  If people talk about variations on<br>
those things, I (e.g.) might overcome my squeemishness and pay attention.<br>
<p>
Robin's post made me realize that I sympathize with outsiders to such<br>
an extent that maybe I'm trying to sympathize with issues that are<br>
more rarified, less mundane than my own.  Abstracting can be dangerous.<br>
<p>
Other people have said that uncomfortable conversations can be good for<br>
you.  But still there's this sense of "brought to you by the sexual<br>
vanguard."  To a sex-starved person variety can look like a luxury (even<br>
if it isn't really) and envy can color perception.<br>
<p>
Of course sexual "starvation" is largely a matter of perception.  You can<br>
live a long healthy life without sex.  It's different with food.<br>
