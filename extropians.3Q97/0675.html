Just came thru the Arizona Port of Entry on I-10 heading east...thermometer<br>
says 105.<br>
<p>
I'm hauling farm tractors and their extra duals.  Four duals (tire...about 2<br>
foot thick by 7 ft in diameter...maybe 500lbs each) are stacked like donuts<br>
on my upperdeck.<br>
I strapped them down...each strap has a breaking strength of 12,000lbs...a<br>
working strength of 5,000lb.  The rule of thumb is to use 1.5times the<br>
working strength times the weight of what is restrained.  (1.5 x 1,000 =<br>
1500...) one strap was way plenty.<br>
<p>
But I noticed that the first strap I tossed over had a cut in it.  So I added<br>
 two more straps just for giggles....I like my redundancy to have redundancy.<br>
 I arranged them in a TeePee or Net fashion...each one going thru a clevis<br>
that I put on the top of the tires.<br>
<p>
Tightened down as hard as I could on the winches...pretty secure.<br>
<p>
The guy here at the port asked me if I had another strap...he pointed out<br>
that one was cut.  To fix it...the "or else" was implied...but none the less<br>
real.<br>
<p>
Now I never argue with cops...they got the guns...and the prime rule of life<br>
is that if youre bigger you get to hit.  So I added another strap.  3 good<br>
straps at 5 thousand  pounds each...plus one that's got to be good for at<br>
least 2000 to hold down a weight of about 1000... <br>
<p>
So I pull around again...Nope...no good ..bad strap....fix it.<br>
(remember....it's 105 degrees.)<br>
<p>
Now I'm a little bit irritated..So I pull ALL the straps off ....except<br>
one...being sure it was really, really pretty....  And pull around there<br>
again....<br>
<p>
He looks at the staps...he looks at me..I grin....he looks at the  straps<br>
again..He didn't see a cut ...everything was fine...I got to go.<br>
<p>
Go figure.<br>
