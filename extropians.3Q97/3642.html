I posted my own visualization of spacetime.  My objection to yours was that it<br>
sounded sort of like this:<br>
<p>
"Imagine a 2-D world with a large hole in the center.  Any flatlander trying<br>
to cross the 'hole' gets squeezed into the center."<br>
I.e., a spatial geometry.<br>
<p>
I was particularly worried because of the way Aegis responded; it sounded like<br>
that's what she had been visualizing.<br>
<p>
Anyway, we both know it's spacetime.<br>
<p>
Sometime I'll have to post a wonderful description of what it would look like<br>
to fall into a black hole; it's from one of my earliest physics books,<br>
"Frontiers of Modern Physics: New Perspectives on Cosmology, Relativity, Black<br>
Holes and Extraterrestrial Intelligence."  (Much smaller than it sounds.)  I<br>
think I was only nine or so at the time, so the only part I really got were<br>
the vivid descriptions of the black hole and the odd behaviors around the<br>
event horizon.<br>
