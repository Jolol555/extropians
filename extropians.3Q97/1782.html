When a conference "clicks", the one feeds the other.<br>
<p>
I saw that happening more often than not.<br>
<p>
Of course, I'm biased about the presentation after dinner, because <br>
I saw actual *progress* there. (big grin).<br>
<p>
Is Ping on this list? If not, can we DRAFT him?<br>
<p>
I'm still grinning...<br>

Agreed. Also worthy of note is that the Doubletree staff is mostly new, <br>
as was probably clear to experienced con-goers used to the more seasoned <br>
Red Lion staff that has been supplanted. <br>
