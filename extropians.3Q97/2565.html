<p>
There is a difference between the three systems you mention, on the <br>
one hand, and nano self-replicator on the other. Mycoplasma <br>
genitalium, automotive vehicles and comersial software are all <br>
required to be fairly optimized. To build an optimised nano <br>
self-reproducing device would be much harder than simply to make <br>
something useful that can replicate. For example, a universal Turing <br>
machine has been constructed in Conway's Life world. The entity is <br>
very big and it was hard, but nothing near a thousands of genius-year <br>
task, to do it. The feasibility stems from the fact that you have <br>
identical components that you can put together into bigger identical <br>
components, and so on, and at each step you need only consider the <br>
apparatus at a certain level of abstraction. If this is the right <br>
analogy for nanotech, then the design work would seem tractable, once <br>
the right tools are there. But I will take your opinion on this <br>
issue into account in my future thinking. And debugging is also a <br>
complication.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; (3) Drexler and Merkle are two very (very!) smart guys.  They have labored</i><br>
<i>&gt; for years, and designed what?  Some bearings, a transmission, a PLA, and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Stewart platform?  And you claim this shows how easy it is?  I'd hate to see</i><br>
<i>&gt; an engineering task you considered hard! If we keep working at this rate,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we should see a complete assembler in around a millenium.</i><br>
<p>
Those are again optimized designs. What about the rod logic <br>
computer? And I didn't Drexler give it as an exercise to his students <br>
to design an autoreplicator when he taught a course at some <br>
university? I am not sure about how detailed these designs are, <br>
though. (Could anybody tell us this, please?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;	As you point out, each partial achievment would bring great benefits </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to the power that makes it, so wouldn't this mean that it would have </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;a good chance of pushing further ahead, leaving the competition </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;behind?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This assumes that it is possible to acquire the massive resources needed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; develop the next generation without letting anyone know how the current</i><br>
<i>&gt; generation works, or even that it works.  I would suggest that this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; impossible, since the resources have to be gathered either by selling</i><br>
<i>&gt; products or extortion by threats of violence.  Both of these are highly</i><br>
<i>&gt; visible activities. </i><br>
<p>
If the early generations of nanotech can be used to build things, <br>
those things can be sold without giving away details about how they <br>
are made. Or if the early generations can be used to build better <br>
computers, then the military might benefit from that while keeping <br>
the project secret.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As soon as the world realizes that there is massive</i><br>
<i>&gt; power to be had, everyone will work like crazy to catch up.</i><br>
<p>
But the leading power will work like crazy to keep the lead. If they <br>
all work equally hard, the one that starts out with an advantage <br>
should get to the goal first. The main point we are discussing is <br>
weather the other powers would by then have obtained enough nanotech <br>
to effectively defend themselves against the leading power. I think <br>
the major military advantages could differ dramatically between some <br>
of the pairs of adjacent generations, so that the first power to <br>
develop the later version would have an easy match against the power <br>
who has the earlier version. This means that even if the whole road <br>
to advanced self-replicators is long and slow, there would still be <br>
some point where a slight progression yielded huge military payoff<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;If superinelligence (that could perform a thousand genius years in a </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;short time) comes before nanotech, or is developed at an early stage </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of nanotech, then the bottle neck would almost certainly be the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;hardware, the molecular tools, and in such a case the maturation </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;process would be almost instantaneous.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I entirely agree.</i><br>
<p>
How likely do you consider that scenario?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;(2), given slow </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;maturation, will that mean that a multipolar world order can remain </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;stable?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;(2)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I believe the answer to the second question is No. I think there </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;would either be a negotiated merger, or the stronger power would </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;obliterate the weaker, and then immediately rebuild itself, and then </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;expand spherically at a good fraction of the light speed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is at least one other possibility, and it is the one that keeps the</i><br>
<i>&gt; world system stable: the cost of subduing the smaller power is more than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; profit obtained from its submission.  Please explain why an imbalance in</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotech is more likely to make this solution infeasible than does an</i><br>
<i>&gt; imbalance in e.g. nuclear missiles, or iron swords.  Nanotech makes the cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; of conquest smaller, but also reduces the profit of conquest, since</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything gets so much cheaper with nanotech.  What are you going to get</i><br>
<i>&gt; from your conquered enemies?  Natuaral resources?  Go to the asteroid belt!</i><br>
<i>&gt; Lebensraum?  Well, that's OK if you like scorched earth.  I'd rather have my</i><br>
<i>&gt; own O'Niell colony. </i><br>
<p>
Forget about the earth, what is at stake is half the universe (the <br>
chance to double the amount of value-structures you can create) and <br>
the possibility of getting rid of an enemy that might decide to <br>
destroy you at a later time. (Even more than this if there are more <br>
than one rival power aspiring to nanotech.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm being sarcastic here, perhaps more than I should be, but I genuinely</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't see the payoff to instantaneous extermination of foriegners through</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotech, espescially when your enemies will have at least nuclear weapons</i><br>
<i>&gt; and at best nanotech only one generation behind your own.  </i><br>
<p>
Not all foriegners would need to be exterminated, only those that <br>
refused a negotiated merger. But if genuinely hostile powers were not <br>
extreminated (or disarmed) at this point, it would only be a matter <br>
of time when they would be in a position where they could <br>
exterminate us.<br>
<p>
Whether nukes are a complication depends on how advanced nanotech we <br>
are talking about. I agree that they would seem to retain some <br>
deterrence at the early stages.<br>
<p>
The outcome also depends on whether a superinelligence is in <br>
controlled or whether the powers are ruled democratically by ordinary <br>
people. In the latter case we would have a further complication.<br>
<p>
Subduing the enemies might be more acceptable to the masses if it <br>
could be done without bloodshed and harm to the other nation's <br>
population. Advanced nanotech would make this possible.<br>
<p>
<p>
What we are discussing lies at the very heart of the future. Maybe it <br>
has never been done so incisively, anywhere, as we are now doing it, <br>
on this thread.<br>
