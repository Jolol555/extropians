<i>&gt;     Eliezer observes:</i><br>
<i>&gt;     How would thoughtsharing of various types affect sexual mores?  Define</i><br>
<i>&gt;     an Augmented human as a "primary" human supported by several other</i><br>
<i>&gt;     experts sharing the world through virtual reality and communicating</i><br>
<i>&gt;     continuously, waking and sleeping, on subvocal/subconscious/hypnotic</i><br>
<i>&gt;     channels.</i><br>
<p>
I think it might be funny to see how singles bars change -- "There's<br>
yes-yes in your eyes" would become harder to argue with, and shy people<br>
could have their desires known more easily.  It could also cause some<br>
fights among the jealous types -- after a stranger walks by, one partner<br>
complains to the other 	"Hey -- that was more than 'just looking'!".<br>
<p>
I also worry about the sorts of situations (remembering a movie, here)<br>
where real wackos get off on raping and murdering so they can feel the<br>
panic/anger/etc. "vibes".<br>
<p>
It also occurs to me that if these sorts of things can be recorded,<br>
the recordings might make useful evidence in rape trials.  Or to<br>
remind feuding or fading couples how they used to feel.<br>
