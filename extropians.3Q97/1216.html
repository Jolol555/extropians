LOL!  Well, doesn't this suggest something to you?  Combine this<br>
consideration with the fact that everything the government tries to do<br>
beyond upholding the law and providing a basic safety net (e.g.<br>
controlling what people may ingest and/or their morality - the 'Drug War')<br>
just makes the problem worse, and ...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;For those of you who have wonderful theories on how to improve government</i><br>

Again, it does you credit that you think like this: the people are<br>
indeed paying your wage.  <br>
<p>
I think the fostering of this meme - that government is our employee -<br>
ought to be the main libertarian political task.  It is the perfect<br>
way-station on the way to no government at all. For as soon as people<br>
understand that the government, at best, is simply a bunch of folks they<br>
have collectively hired to do a job, they will begin to think "Ah, if<br>
that's the case, then perhaps we should look more carefully at what it<br>
is we are asking them to do!"  Also "Ah, if that's the case, then I darn<br>
well want some value for money!"<br>
 <br>
 Does this make some kind of sense to you as a compromise meme on which<br>
 we could agree?<br>

Dear George and other fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
I'll have to think about that one for a while.<br>
<p>
The germ of an idea just struck me and I have to work on it and see what<br>
it develops into before I can do something with it. <br>
<p>
Enjoy!!!<br>
