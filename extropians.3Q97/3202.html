Now that the blizzard has abated I would like to suggest a new type of goo,  <br>
Adrian Karth goo. Oh well, at least now we know the list can handle high <br>
volume.<br>

<p>
                            <br>
I think it's important to ask yourself exactly what is bad about death,  <br>
personally I don't like death because it doesn't seem like much fun, it <br>
doesn't seem like much of anything. Remember those old Twilight Zones when at <br>
the end the hero is horrified to discover that he's really dead, even as a <br>
kid I never understood that. The thing I don't like about death is oblivion, <br>
but this fellow was still discovering things and is experiencing things.<br>
I'd be astounded  and delighted to discover I was dead, because that would <br>
mean death wasn't all it was cracked up to be.<br>
                            <br>

<i>        &gt;you "know" you exist here and now, and that your memories are real         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and your own. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That is my working hypothesis but I don't "know" it to be true, and if I'm <br>
wrong so what. It didn't bother me yesterday, why should it bother me <br>
tomorrow?                   <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>      &gt;Why take this enormous risk with direct uploading when you can do       </i><br>
<i>      &gt;the whole process gradually and without ever losing your consciousness </i><br>
                            <br>
<p>
Well, it's possible that fast uploading will destroy my consciousness while <br>
doing it slowly will preserve it. It's also possible that slow uploading will <br>
destroy my consciousness while doing it quickly preserve it. Both have equal <br>
probability of being correct, about the same chance as me being the only<br>
conscious being in the universe.<br>

<p>
<p>
But some questions are worth asking and can even be answered, such as:<br>
<p>
If I think I'm conscious, am I? <br>
Yes.<br>
<p>
Is it possible that I don't think, I just think I think? <br>
No.<br>
<p>
If I think I've survived, have I? <br>
Yes.<br>
                            <br>
<i>        &gt;Such questions are IMO content-free</i><br>
<p>
I disagree because they have a practical side, a baring on your future <br>
actions.<br>

<i>        &gt;Let's say every time your mind changes, you've died, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then I've already died at least a thousand times today alone and it didn't <br>
bother me one bit. I expect I'll die a thousand times tomorrow too and see no <br>
reason that should be any more unpleasant.<br>
                            <br>

<i>        &gt;keep those memories consistent.  </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
I agree.<br>
<p>
<p>

<i>        &gt;and one little glitch in logic and you're gone.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I grant you that there might be practical advantages in uploading slowly, <br>
at least at first until the bugs are worked out, but I maintain there is no <br>
philosophical advantage.<br>
                            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;if you rebuild your mind in exact detail, you've sort of missed the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;point, since it will be slower than its real world counterpart.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Slower? The software is the same and the hardware is a billion times faster, <br>
why would things be slower?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The new "you" (the uploaded duplicate) will probably think the same,         </i><br>

<i>        &gt;a fake          </i><br>
        <br>
So just what is it that the "original" (whatever that means) has that the <br>
"fake" does not, a soul?                                 <br>
