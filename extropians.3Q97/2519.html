   "There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has<br>
is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough<br>
criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that<br>
it becomes impossible to live without breaking laws."<br>

Mr Retired Government "Civil"Servant  (my yeaaaaaars of government<br>
service...in which..in an earlier post, he ADMITS (no shame...didn't scuff<br>
his foot..turn his head..or NOthing when he said it.) to having participated<br>
in the crafting of thouands of pieces of &lt;restrictive..bydefinition&gt;<br>
regulations....<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;  I'm familiar with "Vote Scam" and numerous other books critical of one</i><br>
<i> &gt;  aspect of government or another. When push comes to shove</i><br>
<p>
To which I insert <br>
(the gubment is usually doing the pushing and shoving...the indian<br>
tribes...the civil war...and little minor episodes such as Ruby Ridge and<br>
Waco. Or how about the "viper militia" in Phoenix Az...bunch of fat ole Viet<br>
Viets who got their jollies by going out in desert and making<br>
boom-boom...reliving times past when the guvment ruint their adolescence....<br>
they were infiltrated by "agent provactuer" of Clinton Administration  who<br>
set 'em up....now one of them is facing jail-time. (jury folded...Judge<br>
INSTRUCTED them to...well you figure it out...but fully informed jury...or<br>
questions of constitutionality...or jury nullification....were specifically<br>
forbidden)<br>
<p>
Mr. Civil Servant  continues:<br>
<i> &gt;however, the system - with all its flaws - usually works until ignorant</i><br>
ideologues<br>
<p>
To which I reply<br>
<p>
But I can't be an ideologue...the gubment says that I'm "apathetic"..(along<br>
with about 150 million others) ..and as for ignorant...it's hard to find out<br>
things when the  leftt-wing controlled media only selectively reports what<br>
fits it's agenda..but I try... I knew about "Vote Scam" ,  as well as how a<br>
Seat for the house in Louisiana was stolen by the liberal...how Bob Dornan's<br>
seat, the house  of Reps from California ,was stolen by the liberal (voter<br>
early,vote often!  We'll even fill in the ballot for you if you no savy<br>
english)... ..and in times past how one such example in Pennsylvania was so<br>
odourous...so Blatant that the election was reversed...how the immigration<br>
and naturalization scoundrels rushed thru several MILLION new<br>
applicants...just in time for the election...never bothering to perform a<br>
background check...which they were required to do BY Law...thus letting<br>
thousands of felons into our country...and how LBJ managed the grave yard<br>
votes...and how in Chicago under Mayor Daley....but you get the picture...you<br>
probably know more about it than I do.....from experience...first hand....I'm<br>
ignorant.<br>
<p>
Mr. Civil Servant said:<br>
<i>&gt;with nothing better to do tear it down. </i><br>
<p>
To which I reply<br>
<p>
You're right.. I'm a Viet Nam vet..Ten years  indentured servitude in the Air<br>
Force. ..six years of that overseas.. I  currently work 80-100 hrs per<br>
week...get home to see my family maybe every other month...get half my<br>
paycheck stolen by the government (in one of it's many<br>
aspects..city/county/state/federal)...whose benevolent minstrations cause<br>
everything that I buy to cost ten times what it would<br>
otherwise...yeah...nothing better to do.<br>
<p>
Mr. Civil Servant Continues<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;  It would be nice if we spent more time trying to improve the system</i><br>
<i> &gt;  instead of just trying to beat it to death.</i><br>
<p>
To which I reply:<br>
<p>
So what...exactly ...would constitute "improving' the system?  Voting? Voting<br>
is like masturbation....it feels good for a little while but has no long term<br>
effect.. Meek submission to the yoke?  "Yasss Massa...I be glaaaaaadd to do<br>
dat Massssa.!! " Evidently identification of error and abuse constitutes<br>
"beating it to death"... <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
&lt;by the way...did you read my post about the deputies  in texas  in search of<br>
those nasty drug lords... breaking into the wrong house...sexually abusing<br>
the two women..psychologically abusing their daughter....we sure NEED 100,<br>
000 more cops don't we...like the Philanderer in Chief said?&gt;<br>
<p>
But doesn't that directly contravene the admonitions of Jefferson?  Remember<br>
him...dead white guy...said something about when a government got too<br>
obnoxious that it was the DUTY of its citizenry to replace it.  (uh...him and<br>
his buddies felt the need to throw off the yoke of  the most powerful<br>
government on earth at the time...for abuses FAR less and taxation FAR less<br>
than we currently endure today)<br>
<p>
To which YakWax replied<br>
 <br>
 Wouldn't the government be perfect if we just got rid of all those obnoxious<br>
 citizens? &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
To which I add my nickel's worth.<br>
<p>
Other governments have had that thought...Hitler(a government) got rid of<br>
several million Jews (and other ethnic groups)...Stalin(a government) made<br>
Hitler look like a piker..starved a whole nation to death (The Ukraine)...Pol<br>
Pot(a government)  killed a few million just a decade or so ago (which Mr.<br>
Civil Servant's government vehemently denied until recently)..<br>
<p>
In fact governments cause more death an destruction... by accident...among<br>
their own citizenry...than the worst criminal ever DREAMT of in his most<br>
blatant delusion of granduer...(how many did Jeffry Daumer kill?..compare<br>
that to _  How many black men died of the Syphillis experiments? How many<br>
unsuspecting hospital patients died in the Plutonium experiments?  How many<br>
innocent soldiers  near the Trinity Site at White Sands died from radiation<br>
induced cancer from being ordered to line up..face "thataway" and have a nuke<br>
blown up in their face?) <br>
<p>
And now with the advent of nanotechnology...and the goo hue dilema...consider<br>
Mr. Civil Servant's remarks...and wonder ... Do we REAAAAALLY want nanotech<br>
to be a government monoply?  (pick a government...any government...even a<br>
world government)<br>
