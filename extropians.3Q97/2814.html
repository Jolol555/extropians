<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;         Wow.  Those are beautiful words; you mean to tell me that Rifkin</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sees the above sentences as *bad* things?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That was a direct quote attributed to Rifkin. In the preceeding text the</i><br>
<i>&gt; author, who apparently spoke with Rifkin, said the man considers</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual human identies are, at least pertly, "endowments of the natural</i><br>
<i>&gt; world," and that any technologies (genetic engineering in particular),</i><br>
<i>&gt; that can alter that endowment can "undermine the sense of self."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So yes, it appears he considers these *bad* things.  Talk about</i><br>
<i>&gt; polarity...</i><br>
<p>
I'm starting to think Jaron Lanier was right in his much-cited (well,<br>
somewhat-cited) editorial "Extropians and Stewards"<br>
(<a href="http://www.well.com/user/jaron/topspin.html">http://www.well.com/user/jaron/topspin.html</a>) where he suggests an<br>
ideological division between those who want to preserve and those<br>
who want to evolve. This seems quite similar to de Garis terrans vs. <br>
cosmists. Rifkin is 100% on the Steward/Terran side.<br>
<p>
It is interesting to note that these two views, while they can back<br>
up some of their arguments with facts, are basically differences in<br>
values and hence not resolvable through rational discussion. <br>
