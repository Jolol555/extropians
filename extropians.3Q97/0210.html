Eric Watt Forste &lt;arkuat@pobox.com&gt; injected some great noise:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Precisely the opposite is true. I can't think of any reason to</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe that anyone could objectively observe anything happening</i><br>
<i>&gt; inside the very instrument they are observing with.  One can observe</i><br>
<i>&gt; one's own feelings, but one cannot do so objectively, at least not</i><br>
<i>&gt; without doing great violence to the ordinary-usage sense of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; English word "objective" as it is usually applied to the word</i><br>
<i>&gt; "observation".</i><br>
<p>
	I'm not talking doing violence to the word "objective".  We<br>
will have machinery that will objectively observe complex "neural<br>
correlates" and predict when one is experiencing a common "red"<br>
sensation.  We will objectively understand what this subjective "red"<br>
sensation physically is and why (or at least how) the particular<br>
neural operations produce such a phenomenal experience and how our<br>
brain builds these individual sensations into our unified worlds of<br>
consciousness.<br>
<p>
	Eventually we will have artificial machinery that, like<br>
brains, objectively produces such subjective sensations, and uses such<br>
to not only represent and reason about information but also to<br>
motivate and to impart value, love, and other things that are usually<br>
considered "spiritual".<br>
<p>
	If we can make machines (other than by procreation) that<br>
produce such sensations, would you not consider such engineering<br>
knowledge "objective" knowledge without doing violence to the meaning<br>
of that word?  Our DNA objectively knows how to do it, we've simply<br>
got to ask it how it does it and then do likewise.<br>
