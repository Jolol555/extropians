<i>&gt; who have demonstrated the ability/imagination to care for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; group of people instead of just themselves should be allowed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; vote and run for political office?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the story, it is assumed that being a veteran is the only</i><br>

<i>&gt; ability, and more importantly other ways to prove you have it?</i><br>
<p>
The reason vets had the power was explained. RAH presumed a future that<br>
had gone into a near collapse, but everything was put back together by<br>
vets, who wrote their own constitution, so its obviously a result of<br>
self interest as much as our own Constitution's early definition of a<br>
Negro as being 3/5ths of a man, but men who couldn't vote, for the<br>
benefit of slaveholding southern states to hold more power in the House<br>
of Representatives. RAH's story was to illustrate his beleif that a vet<br>
dominated government would be a better form of democracy than the one we<br>
have now in terms of being able to recognise and react to outside<br>
threats.<br>
<p>
In the "present day" of the story, its also explained that a "vet" is<br>
anyone who has been in government service, so its apparently grown to<br>
the point where its not quite government by bureaucracy.<br>
