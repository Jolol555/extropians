I don't think there's been any period of inflation in the<br>
United States as bad as the 1970s since the Civil War.  The Fed<br>
was in full control of the money supply during the 1970s.  And<br>
I don't think that any economic fluctuation in United States<br>
history was quite as bad as the Great Depression, which also<br>
happened on the Fed's watch.<br>
<p>
The old gold economy produced nothing to match these disasters.<br>
<p>
(The Civil War inflation was a result of outright<br>
counterfeiting by both governments, like the old Continentals<br>
of the Continental Congress or the worthless paper money<br>
printed by the Weimar republic... nothing to do with the gold<br>
economy there.)<br>
