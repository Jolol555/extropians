I am a cryonicist, and I apologize if this is an old, old, conversation,<br>
but nobody seemed too concerned with commenting on it for a couple days.<br>
<p>
Several of your thoughts were interesting to me.<br>
You also seemed to have some questions, so ...<br>
<p>

   If I had to choose ongoingness of my personal awareness, <br>
   I'd choose an uploading and storage of my experiences because <br>
   that's more me than my body which seems to curiously change <br>
   from year to year.  <br>
<p>
This is one of the Great ideas, especially if you have no doubts about <br>
getting what you want out of the experience with the Tech available at <br>
the time.  I will, no doubt, find an option similar to what is now <br>
thought of as uploading an unavoidable necessity, just not any time real <br>
soon.<br>
<p>
   Freezing my body (or even more whimsically, my head) <br>
   seems a rather quaint notion.<br>
<p>
To me, it seems like an extreme notion.  Indeed, I believe that dying <br>
and being frozen to perserve the physical pattern of my identity is the <br>
second worst thing that can happen to me.  The reason I am a suspension <br>
member, is to avoid the worst thing that can happen to me...<br>
<p>
     Does extropian thinking focus so much on the physically proven and<br>
     sound as to consider this the most preferable and viable <br>
     solution to achieving "immortality"?  <br>
<p>
I believe, as a newly realized extropian, that the realm of <br>
thought includes considerably more conservative estimations, and wildly <br>
more imaginative speculations on the possible. The extropian continuum <br>
also manifests a stong "gravitational" gradient for the currently<br>
feasible with an eye toward pushing that to the physically, or even <br>
conceptually possible.<br>
<p>
   As a mental exercise, I wonder what<br>
   discoveries of the essence, the unforseen would radically change <br>
   such notions?  That which is beyond the horizon where the <br>
   fishermen's wives are no longer visible from the shore and you <br>
   are going on gut instinct and conviction.<br>
<p>
The above is yet another argument for cryonics' <br>
"ambulance to a doctor 100 years in the future."  If I am to give <br>
myself a better, or even perhaps a good, chance of seeing one of the <br>
better solutions to continued identity, I need to excercise the <br>
options available to me. Even if I had been alive for 400 years,  <br>
I would not cling to the medical traditions of the time of my birth.  <br>
Just so with life extension.  I would much rather make regular <br>
backups of my pattern (along with streaming real-time backups, if <br>
available) which were likely to survive my physical existence, <br>
rather than provide for being frozen.  No such thing is around.  <br>
Cryonics, as imperfect as it currently is, happens now.<br>
<p>
   To subscribe to life extension methods such as cryonics, <br>
   I'd have to be more sure of what "life" is.  Too many details <br>
   missing from this to make an informed decision.  <br>
<p>
Need more time to think...? How about more than your "natural" lifetime?<br>
  <br>
   To me, it's akin to a kid saying, when I grow up, I want to be <br>
   a firefighter, all because s/he likes the trucks and the uniform <br>
   and is completely oblivious to the danger and personality type <br>
   required for such a job.  Maybe that's enough of a notion to <br>
   go for it.  <br>
<p>
Is this saying that a longer life might not be good, or that cryonic<br>
suspension won't be fulfilling?  Any cryonicists want to chime in<br>
with their fond yearnings for suspension for its own sake?<br>
<p>
   For me, cryonics sounds like a better spin on life <br>
   insurance...you may get to enjoy it.  Gentlemen, place your bets.<br>
<p>
Well, you must admit, there is a point there.  I feel much <br>
better about paying my $24.58 a month for the chance that I might <br>
actually be around to see and take care of my friends and loved ones, <br>
instead of having a lump sum payment do it alone.<br>
<p>
Concerning the inherent assumption that there is another alternative<br>
to a currently understood process for preservation:<br>
<p>
Even assuming some chance of existence beyond death without <br>
intervention, I am not interested in a deity that is angry about <br>
my attempts to survive. That kind of god is already steamed about <br>
those antibiotics I took...<br>
<p>
Reincarnation can wait until I have some pretty good evidence <br>
that I will be substantially better off...<br>
<p>
Concerning the probabilities involved:<br>
<p>
Those who wish to be in the control group need do nothing.  <br>
You are already signed up! <br>
<p>
Since I'll probably be truly dead otherwise,<br>
it's the experimental group for me.<br>
