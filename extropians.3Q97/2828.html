     The responses to my ad hoc analysis of the question of legitimacy of <br>
     supernatural or speculative phenomenon (modern folk lore) dealt with <br>
     personal experiences as to how, as youths, each author confessed to a <br>
     UFO hoax of some kind.  It's all a child's prank, folks, back to work.<br>
     <br>
     The point of my post was in the social and emotional dynamics <br>
     *associated* with the responses to such fringe/pseudo/junk topics.  <br>
     This is an area where extropian principles get quite disoriented, <br>
     where the impossible remains irrefutably the impossible because there <br>
     are presently no scientific strings to hold it up.  The dreaming is <br>
     big as long as its in a qualified arena which is all well and good.  <br>
     The speculations of that which would be regarded scientifically as <br>
     outrageous have a purpose just as imaginary friends, fairies, and <br>
     Santa Claus have to children.  <br>
     <br>
     I, for one, would not dismiss the impulse of a child to fabricate a <br>
     UFO sighting or a drunken young man to rig a hoax.  Neither of these <br>
     things serve to *invalidate* anything except for that person's <br>
     individual actions.  Sure, there are gobs of people likely <br>
     perpetrating similar hoaxes.  I don't go chasing after them, have no <br>
     obsessive interest in their potential authenticity but I am intrigued <br>
     by the motivation.  <br>
     <br>
     There's a children's movie coming out soon that is loosely based on a <br>
     prank two little British girls played at the turn of the century.  <br>
     Using what was then, relatively new technology, they photographed <br>
     themselves with "cut-out" fairies they constructed and made headlines <br>
     that they had discovered real fairies.  As grown women, the girls <br>
     reportedly confessed to the hoax.  At the time, their community was in <br>
     a frenzy to see the fairies, to believe, to get in touch with <br>
     something very deeply ingrained in all of us, a desire to see the <br>
     extraordinary, the unbelievable.  I regard those impulses as anything <br>
     but coincidental.  <br>
     <br>
     Incidentally, from what I can tell from the trailer for this film, the <br>
     story is being pitched as "true" with special-effects fairies all the <br>
     rage.  Look for them in your Toys-R-Us real soon.  But y'know, fairies <br>
     have quite a lot of appeal as mythic figures go.<br>
     <br>
     Thus far, events like The Singularity, for all their assurance to <br>
     evolve us beyond the brink of our imagination, have all the appeal of <br>
     a Borg assimilation. <br>
     <br>
     I have no need to read books that *debunk* any more than I have time <br>
     to read those in favor because I don't invest enough energy into <br>
     believing them in the first place.  BELIEVING IS A CHOICE.  Although I <br>
     haven't read the book on which the film is based, a central point of <br>
     the film "Contact" was that empirical truth was superseded by one <br>
     person's unique and unexplained experience.  I don't know if the same <br>
     series of events existed in the book but I found it ironic that the <br>
     senate inquiry at the end of the film actually proposed that, per <br>
     Occam's Razor, it was more likely that the world's richest eccentric <br>
     perpetrated an immense and costly hoax on the world. Of course, only <br>
     Ellie Arroway *knew* (or thought she knew) differently.  Everyone else <br>
     had to go on faith and a covetous group are we when we don't get our <br>
     own experience.<br>
     <br>
     If on the scales we can imagine, we've a sense hat we're being lead <br>
     along by big government, big business, big media, whoever, who's to <br>
     say that on the grandest scales we are not so apt to consider, that <br>
     reality as we know it might be an immense, cosmological play.  Perhaps <br>
     that notion has something to do with the fact that when I see a film <br>
     like "Contact", no matter how many times, I'm moved to tears because <br>
     somehow I know, without being able to prove, that "the game is afoot" <br>
     and my sudden emotion is more attributed to the folly of my myopic <br>
     thinking and the consequential pain that it has caused.  Is it true?  <br>
     No, it's what I feel.  Truth is but varying levels of agreement based <br>
     upon observations and repetition.  We're so confident now that we <br>
     won't fall off the edge of the world but we know so little of it, much <br>
     less the rest of the universe, whether physical or non-physical.  <br>
     <br>
     Perhaps the dream is dreaming us.<br>
     <br>
