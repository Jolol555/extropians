Hmmm.. want to quote some text but I have no mouse (I/O card just exploded,<br>
hard disk corrupted, everything's broken).  Anyway, Natasha More replied to<br>
my comment about 'art being creativity without justification' and I'd just<br>
like to say that I didn't actually mean to send that e-mail out because I had<br>
phrased it wrongly, but somehow it got sent anyway (something somewhere is<br>
probably broken).  What I should have said was something along the lines of<br>
"scientists are artists who feel the need to justify their work."  The<br>
scientist builds idea and 'things' around a need to prove something or stay<br>
within the boundaries of fact, the artist is more freely creative, has less<br>
outside justification for what he/she is doing and generally explores themes<br>
beyond the realm of fact, the psuedo-scientist builds ideas around false<br>
boundaries(?) which he/she believes to be factual.<br>
<p>
..or something like that.<br>
