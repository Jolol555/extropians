     A suspicious letter drops through the slot in the door.<br>
     <br>
     It has a plastic window through which you read:<br>
     <br>
     Congratulations on your new purchase:<br>
     "supreme meme" is "No idea is sacred"<br>
     You may already have won MORE!<br>
     <br>
     You wipe your sweaty brow and tear the envelope open...<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Here is the fine print:<br>
     <br>
     Whether the idea / notion / concept / label / category / belief / <br>
     slogan / vehicle of cultural appropriation of "meme" ...<br>
     (delete whatever proves applicable / inapplicable)<br>
     ...is really built to include paradox.<br>
     <br>
     Because "No idea is sacred" is not a paradox, nor is it true; just as <br>
     "No idea is sacred, except the sacred ones." is. The logical <br>
     equivalent of the value statement "no idea is sacred" is "No statement <br>
     is true." which is a paradox, as is "Nothing is true" as in "Nothing <br>
     is true, everything is permitted.". If you accept the logical <br>
     equivalent, you accept the paradox. If you stick with last week's <br>
     "supreme meme" which is "No idea is sacred" you buy the problems of <br>
     defining "sacred", and which dictionary best defines it? And who wrote <br>
     that? And who told them? Someone will eventually tell you that god <br>
     told them, and then you'll have a schizophrenic on your hands, telling <br>
     you this is sacred and that's sacred and now it's time to make war <br>
     with the infidel because they say the sacred sandal of OofaBlathaTekk <br>
     smells like curry and we know it smells like cheese.<br>
     <br>
     So: reject falsity in a world where nothing is true<br>
                               or<br>
     Establish and enshrine new hierarchies of nonsense (new AND IMPROVED!)<br>
     <br>
     What's yer poison, cowboy? <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     The qualifying factor that could make "meme" special enough to <br>
     <br>
     also represent paradox is that it is, I believe, a french term <br>
     <br>
     equivalent to "mama".<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     And while you're at it, why not consider<br>
     <br>
     why the concept of meme was ever invented<br>
     <br>
     in the first place<br>
     <br>
     and in whose name is it propogated<br>
     <br>
     and what exactly is it<br>
     <br>
     that makes it<br>
     <br>
     just<br>
     <br>
     so<br>
     <br>
     special?<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     "It's the bubbles of nothing that make it really something."  <br>

     You leave the empty envelope near the phone, at the bottom of the neat <br>
     stack of other empty envelopes, scribbled messages for housemates, <br>
     other people's lives. <br>
