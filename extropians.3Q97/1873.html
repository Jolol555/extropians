<i>&gt;Thanks, Darren. But &lt;/hubris mode ON&gt; wait until next year! &lt;/OFF&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Aw, I can't! The overall conference was, in my opinion, an astonishing<br>
success.<br>
<p>
<p>
Max continued:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I did find the inclusion of a debate on the future of gender quite bizarre.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I fail to see that gender has any long-term future</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It certainly has a future as long-term as the introduction of</i><br>
<i>&gt;nanotechnology</i><br>
<p>
We're probably in agreement, then. My "long-term" was longer than yours. <br>
<p>
What I'd really like to hear, preferably from someone who has studied the<br>
subject, is what the definition of gender actually is.<br>
<p>
For the sake of fun, here is the argument you asked me to provide:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Gender may change drastically over the coming centuries, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;you need to provide an argument that it has no long-term future.</i><br>
<i>&gt;You may be correct, but that's not obvious.</i><br>
<p>
I criticised the gender panel. Criticising someone else is easy and small.<br>
Much more difficult would be for me to have an original idea, as did so<br>
many of the panellists.<br>
<p>
So I'm sorry. I risk consigning my thoughts to the history bin by omitting<br>
references to statistical or experimental studies, but I will attempt,<br>
without waiting for our official definition, an argument from logic. (That<br>
is, begging pardons from all, what I like to think I am good at.)<br>
<p>
I guess that it depends upon what your goals are, and mine include being<br>
one of those "fit" entities who will "survive". The phrase "the survival of<br>
the fittest" may be harmless tautology, but as competition for resources<br>
hots up, I can only imagine that those who survive will indeed be the<br>
fittest, and that the logical conclusion the fittest will come to is that<br>
gender is an ancestral oddity. <br>
<p>
An evaluation of an individual for the purposes of determining whether or<br>
not one should invest in exchanging information with them should<br>
approximate the value of the information which could be exchanged, the<br>
probability that it will be exchanged successfully, and the cost of<br>
exchanging it or at least trying; all in a variety of possible scenarios.<br>
<p>
I've tried putting gender into into the equation at all available points,<br>
and, assuming that the other entities in the exchange have the same<br>
rationality (big assumption admittedly), it doesn't seem to me to fit. What<br>
other purpose does gender serve?<br>
<p>
Perhaps if we replace the word "gender" with "characterisation", it starts<br>
to make sense. Or "sex" perhaps?<br>
<p>
As usual with these things, I bet the debate finally boils down to the<br>
semantic definition. I feel as if the word "gender" has been hijacked by a<br>
community of those whose minds are sexually preoccupied. Once a mere<br>
semantic classification itself, it now seems to have all manner of varied<br>
meanings depending upon which literature you read. And I don't read very<br>
much of it, so I had better shut up.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;For most of the next century at least, I see gender becoming increasingly</i><br>
<i>&gt;individualized but not extinct.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, now I see where I have gone wrong, and admit it. The "future" does<br>
indeed begin now. Gender has a place now, assuredly for the next ten<br>
minutes, and, as you point out, perhaps for a century or more to come. I<br>
was looking a little further ahead than that when I said "long-term".<br>
Probably much too far for the opinion to have any relevance.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Secondly, the loudest contributions come</i><br>
<i>&gt;not from silence but from participation.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;pregnant pause&gt;<br>
<p>
&lt;g&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
Regards,<br>
Darren<br>
