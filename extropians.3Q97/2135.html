There's probably some of that -- keep the innocents from the fleshpots<br>
of the city.  Then again, since these families started in the city, I<br>
think this is too simplistic.  America, at least of the 1950s, has<br>
having your own house as part of the "Dream".  That supplies desire, and<br>
tax subsidies for mortgages and direct subsidies of cars and freeways<br>
supplies the means for an explosion into the suburbs.  When the city<br>
starts declining more people flee increasing crime and decay.  I like to<br>
think their safety remains the same, transferring risk of crime to risk<br>
of auto accidents, but I have no data.<br>

<p>
I re-read that part.  She doesn't say explicitly what monetarism said<br>
about stagflation.  For all the other theories she shows an explicit<br>
contradiction, but elsewhere implies that stagflation defeated all<br>
macro-economic theories.  Monetarism was called in after stagflation<br>
took effect but failed (as of her writing) to cure the problem, so there<br>
is probably no contradiction.  Monetarism seems adequate theoretically<br>
but failed in practice, and thus was defeated.  "In sum, measures<br>
contrived to fight inflation were proving ruinous to producers and their<br>
work forces, while measures contrived to help producers were enlarging<br>
government deficits."<br>
<p>
I think, but am not sure, that stagflation ended under Volcker/Greenspan<br>
by the mid-80s.  I presume that would provisionally count as vindication<br>
for monetarism -- unless one could find some other reason for recovery.<br>
I've been inclined anyway to suspect that macro-economics is the real<br>
voodoo economics, simply due to lack of solid data (complex subject,<br>
we've only been collecting good data for some decades, and screwing with<br>
the system in different ways most of the time -- not exactly a<br>
controlled experiment); Jacobs' criticism and the apparently universal<br>
bafflement at the current state of the economy aren't doing much to<br>
convince me otherwise.<br>
<p>
} An interesting supporting point to her claim - I don't know if she makes it<br>

<p>
Yep, I've gotten that far.  As Anton notes, she blames national<br>
currencies.  She accepts classical analysis of currencies as feedback<br>
mechanism -- import too much and your currency drops, forming an<br>
automatic and temporary tariff and export subsidy -- then first makes an<br>
analogy to a hundred people with a hundred lungs and one brainstem.  Not<br>
a healthy situation; this is the multi-city nation.  Later she describes<br>
one brainstem controlling the breathing of an elephant, 3 sheep, 2<br>
puppy dogs and a rabbit.  This is a multi-city nation much of whose<br>
trade is international.  Presumably one city will be strongest in trade;<br>
it then gets the most accurate feedback signals from currency<br>
fluctuations.  The other cities get choked off, and the nation-state<br>
turns into a city-state with excessive welfare rolls (i.e. the rest of<br>
the country.  Rural America gets a larger share of welfare dollars than<br>
most voters realize, I think.)<br>

} and its hinterland.  Examples: London/England, Paris/France,<br>
} Berlin/Prepartition Germany, Tokyo/Japan, Moscow/Soviet Union, Madrid/Spain,<br>
} Lisbon/Portugal, Athens/Greece, Mexico City/Mexico, Buenos Aires/Argentina,<br>
} Sydney/Australia.  The city-state is typically 1/6 or so of the population,<br>
<p>
Milan and relatives/Italy, Stockholm Sweden, Copenhagen/Denmark,<br>
Toronto/Canada.  The<br>
Netherlands are a partial exception:  many cities are hooked up in a<br>
"Ring City".  The basic rule holds: one currency, one active economic<br>
region.<br>
<p>
Large empires mostly trade domestically, so there's no feedback, and the<br>
cities wander market space at random until they die off.  This may be<br>
what happened to the Roman Empire; control was increasing centralized,<br>
and the various cities gradually decayed.  <br>
<p>
The US has a high proportion of domestic trade, so turning into a<br>
city-state would be slow at best.  Earlier in our history, and in Japan<br>
as well, protective tariffs can take the place of currency fluctuation.<br>
Post-colonial cities should have had weak currencies, because they were<br>
weak, but being grouped with strong rural exports (especially from the<br>
South) boosted the dollar and could have strangled development, as in<br>
her example of Uruguay.  Tariffs helped our cities develop, but<br>
effectively this was a subsidy from the South, and tariffs don't provide<br>
internal feedback.<br>
<p>
One thing about the Pacific Rim, the "tigers of Asia": Hong Kong and<br>
Singapore are nothing but cities with their own currencies, and Taiwan<br>
and South Korea are pretty small, close to city-states naturally.<br>
<p>
Another optimistic note about them was that Western Europe took<br>
centuries to rebuild after the fall of Rome, led by Venice which fed off<br>
of Constantinople in the beginning.  America took about a century or two<br>
to build up its cities.  Japan took a few decades (twice) to<br>
industrialize.  The Pacific Rim has moved even faster.  Whether this is<br>
due to greater general knowledge or being smaller and smaller bits<br>
relative to a large economy is unclear, but it might be good news for<br>
the speed of development elsewhere, if it ever starts right.<br>
<p>
But medieval Europe had many, many currencies, at least once they were<br>
rich enough to have any currencies.  The cities of the Hanseatic League<br>
had their own currencies.<br>

True.  "Great city", "city region", "import-replacing city".  I like<br>
"great city" myself.  Do San Diego or the big cities of Texas qualify?<br>
I'm wondering what the distribution of great cities is in this country,<br>

<p>
Maybe she says that later; so far it's because we have a lot of domestic<br>
trade, and perhaps multiple strong international trading cities to begin<br>
with.<br>
<p>
She also suggests that unification might have been China's bane,<br>
claiming most Chinese innovations preceded full unification.  If true<br>
this would be a more concrete link than Jared Diamond used to explain<br>
why Europe overtook China.  He had to say being unified allowed China to<br>
regress stupidly as one unit, without competition.  Jacobs would posit<br>
that stagnation was inevitable.<br>
<p>
All of which suggests that Europe is about to make a big mistake.  If<br>
currencies -- feedbacks -- should be tightly linked to the regions they're<br>
feeding back to, Europe needs more, not less.  Scotland and Southern<br>
Italy have cities, after all; they just don't do anything.  Being<br>
coupled without feedback to London and northen Italy is bad enough.<br>
All of Europe?<br>

And even priests were coming to spend some time in it, because of the<br>
collection of religious books.  There were one thousand, two hundred and<br>
eighty-three religious books in there now, each one--according to<br>
itself--the only one any man need ever read.  It was sort of nice to see<br>
them all together. -- Terry Pratchett, _Small Gods_<br>
