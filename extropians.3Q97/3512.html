<p>
&lt;&lt; Despite our friend EvMicks usual cynicism it must be remembered that the<br>
 vast majority of election are fair and honest. It is a rare exception when<br>
 there is so much tampering with the voting machines or the ballot box that<br>
 an election has to be done over.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Naturally...I figured that would be the case...and since one election is of<br>
no importance...I would be foolish to mention the fifteen or twenty<br>
others...so I won't.<br>
<p>
 In this situation -- and being more than slightly familiar with Mr.<br>
 Dornan's past antics -- I suspect that he is spending an inordinate amount<br>
 of time inventing a nice juicy conspiracy theory. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
Nevermind that he has documented all his claims<br>
<p>
&lt;He will, no doubt, be<br>
 aided and abeted by his friends on the extreme right wing of the<br>
 Republican Party and a scandal hungry media.&gt;<br>
<p>
Actually...the spineless Republicans are distancing themselves from him...and<br>
the media is doing it's best to ignor the whole episode...as it is with<br>
numerous other situations with the administration...the Arkansas State<br>
Trooper...The media campaign felonies...Al Gore's<br>
"indescretions"...etc...etc..etc...<br>
<p>
 &lt;&lt;Don't take it too seriously. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Naw...course not...if you did...then George Washington's quote might come to<br>
mind.<br>
<p>
"Government is like fire...a valuable servant...but a terrible master".<br>
