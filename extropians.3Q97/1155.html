Comfort?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the perspective of the confused people, they're not confused.  Most</i><br>
don't actually care.  The average person's worries go about as far as which<br>
government to choose (at the most), and then they hand the problems over to<br>
them. They choose comfort and ignorance over empowerment and truth.<br>
 Governments and religions are offering people the easy way out, the delusion<br>
that by voting or praying they're going to make a difference.<br>
<p>
Just to prove a point, there was a chat show on a couple of days ago (I don't<br>
know the name it wasn't that important).  They were talking about the<br>
problems with child crime on the streets, a couple of people were discussing<br>
the need to get kids 'off the streets', and then a woman in the audience<br>
stood up and said:<br>
<p>
"We don't need to be out on the streets helping these kids, we need to be in<br>
our homes praying for their souls"<br>
<p>
The audience clapped and cheered.  There's you problem.<br>
