Microsoft has billions of dollars because we don't have a free market.<br>
 Without copyright and property rights Microsoft couldn't keep it's<br>
customers.  The free market, due to the lack of copyright, incourages user<br>
centric product design.  A company cannot keep customers by _locking them in_<br>
like Microsoft, it has to keep customers with superior design and<br>
implementation.  I expect to see the freeware approach to software design as<br>
the standard way of doing things in the free market.  Creating network<br>
communities that play a part in building your products is an excellent way of<br>
insuring sales.  The fact is things like Linux, GNU, etc. could make huge<br>
amounts of money without comprimise on freedom or open standards, but the<br>
computer market is not mature enough to focus on areas beyond technology.<br>
<p>
I don't see how art or personal exploration would be changed by the move to a<br>
free market, other than the cost of living being less.<br>
