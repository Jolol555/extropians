Hi!<br>
<p>
Thank you all for your replies, pretty much what you defend is economic<br>
anarchy, although you don't use this word.<br>

<p>
Voluntary actions? You're talking of voluntary, unselfish actions from<br>
the same species that constantly kills, destroys and robs other members<br>
of the same species? I don't think that's possible in today's world,<br>
there's just too many greedy and selfish persons.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Won't this corporations have too much power and therefore harming</i><br>

<i>&gt; I doubt that they'd have as much power as governments do now,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and governments often harm everyone (the consumers and general</i><br>
<i>&gt; public) but themselves.</i><br>
<p>
In all your messages there is a hate towards government, I also despise<br>
politicians but don't corporations 'own' the government, even in the<br>
U.S.? It's the same thing, the same problem.<br>

<p>
I'll be honest, I don't know what negative feedback is and I know<br>
nothing of basic economics but I always knew that "united we stand,<br>
divided we fall". If a corporation starts achieving a substantial<br>
advantage towards everyone else, as it grows, it will eventually become<br>
more efficient, more capable, will be able to have the most competitive<br>
prices and therefore, will achieve a monopoly status. Right? (I see that<br>
in Portugal every time, small shops complaining about big commercial<br>
centers and supermarkets)<br>

<i>&gt; environmental issues addressed.</i><br>
<p>
I think that this sentence is a good example of a very important detail<br>
you seem to forget.<br>
In this list, and even in the internet, the average person is from a<br>
much higher social scale and much higher intellectual level than the<br>
rest of the population. IMHO, most persons are stupid, plain stupid.<br>
Besides, many persons are also selfish and greedy. The consumer, the<br>
common citizen doesn't know and doesn't care about environmental issues.<br>
I'll give you an example, one of the first countries to urge for serious<br>
measures to prevent global warming was Holland. Why? Not for altruistic<br>
reasons, of course, but because part of Holland is below sea level, land<br>
conquered to the sea by dams.<br>
You talk about how the market will control big corporations and the<br>
millions of consumers will lead the market into the best path, let me<br>
ask you something, why is government so corrupt? People theoretically<br>
control government (by voting) and still government is corrupt, why is<br>
that? What makes you think that indirect control of economy by persons<br>
is going to improve anything?<br>
<p>
EvMick says that free-market works, my question is for whom, for the<br>
persons who are already wealthy or for the ones who are poor and have<br>
nothing?<br>
Since unselfish reasons rarely incentives anyone to do anything, let me<br>
ask you something, do you think that the poorer classes generated by<br>
free-markets will stand still? My bet is that they'll riot and that is<br>
what I fear.<br>
<p>
Finally, one more, last, thing, Chris R. Tame wrote:<br>
<i>&gt; Doesn't anyone read books anymore?  Why do so many people on the net ask</i><br>

<i>&gt; going to the basic literature rather than by a flurry of incomplete or</i><br>
<i>&gt; sketchy net responses? Who wants to spend time typing in elementary</i><br>
<i>&gt; introductions to basic libertarian thought?</i><br>
<p>
I read books, I find it, however, much less boring and time consuming to<br>
ask other persons. Or do you read a book every time you have a doubt or<br>
a question?<br>
<p>
Thank you all for your replies,<br>
