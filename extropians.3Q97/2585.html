<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, there's a couple of questions I'd pose about nuclear nanotech:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; A fission bomb is based on the creation of a critical mass, where the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; growth of neutron flux due to fission is larger than the loss into the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; surroundings. Unless nanotech could build a neutron reflector (which I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; doubt is physically possible?)</i><br>
<p>
Probably not possible. It is a matter of nuclear properties rather tham <br>
electronic <br>
and molecular structure.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Okay.  Well, it'd take more tech than I thought, but a few points:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Modern atomic technology goes like this:  You have a mass of U235, with all</i><br>
<i>&gt;the atoms inside being arranged randomly.  Atoms fission all the time, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt;material isn't very dense, so most neutrons escape.  Then an implosive</i><br>
<i>&gt;explosion occurs which condenses the material down to a tiny, tight ball. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Neutrons collide with other U235 atoms, causing a chain reaction.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We all know this implicitly, but I'm verbalizing it so we can alter the </i><br>
scenario.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
R. Feynman quote:"<br>
<i>&gt;they did not know that the neutrons were enormously more effective when they</i><br>
<i>&gt;are slowed down in water.  In water it takes less than a tenth - no, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;hundredth - as much material to make a reaction that makes radioactivity.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt;kills people around and so on.  It was very dangerous, and they had not paid</i><br>
<i>&gt;any attention to the safety at all."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So you don't need neutron reflectors; just ordinary water.  I'm not sure</i><br>
<i>&gt;whether "10% to make radioactivity" and "10% to get critical mass" are the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;thing. </i><br>
<p>
Not quite. Water acts as a neutron moderator, i. e. it slows "fast' neutrons <br>
down,<br>
increasing the collision cross section, hence the rate of nuclear reactions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'd be surprised to</i><br>
<i>&gt;find out that they were unrelated, though.  Still, it could be that no amount</i><br>
<i>&gt;of water decreases the size of a critical mass.  Let me know if so.</i><br>
<p>
Just so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;And, getting a bit speculative, what if you take U235, store it in ordinary</i><br>
<i>&gt;water, and then use nano to "catch" the slowed neutrons that emerge?  Could</i><br>
<i>&gt;you store the neutrons and use them as a catalyst for the bomb?</i><br>
<p>
Nyet. Free neutron half-life is about 15 minutes. Also, an atom cannot <br>
"grab" a neutron, only a nucleus can, changing the isotope or causing fission.<br>

<i>&gt;Inertial confinement only operates on a single pellet, the fuse.  (Ha ha!) </i><br>
<i>&gt;The problem with inertial confinement is delivering enough energy. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Quantum-well lasers are something like 10 to 100 times as efficient, and I</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe they aren't difficult to construct given nano.  Englobe the whole</i><br>
<i>&gt;pellet with lasers instead of using one.  Then fire.  I think that you could</i><br>
<i>&gt;probably deliver at least 1,000 times as much energy as in modern inertial</i><br>
<i>&gt;confinement.  It'd take a gigajoule to set the thing off, sure, but then you</i><br>
<i>&gt;have a fusion explosion and you can use it to set off arbitrarily larger ones.</i><br>
<p>
***Very, very good Mr. Yudkowsky.***<br>
<p>
 What you have started to describe is a device I<br>
conceived several years ago and have not published, called "Mr Fusion". This in <br>
fact constitutes the first public disclosure. And yes, it is very much like <br>
current laser inertial confinement, except the EMP front is vastly more <br>
structurally refined. Each laser is individually addressable. It may be possible <br>
to convert some portion of the released energy directly to electric by using the <br>
QM well as receivers.<br>
See "The Optical Assembler" interview at the NanoTechnology magazine website for <br>
a description of a similar array.<br>
<p>
==================================================================================<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Ask</i><br>
<i>&gt;some fusion researcher:  "If you had complete control over the molecular</i><br>
<i>&gt;structure of matter, and could get anything built of available atoms just by</i><br>
<i>&gt;wishing for it, could you build a powerful fusion reactor?"</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but this still requires bettter plasma dynamics modeling and the rest of <br>
the things that have been just around the corner for the last forty years.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm far from an expert on explosives... but couldn't you get a bit of an</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; improvement by detonating the ENTIRE bomb with electronic synchronization, </i><br>
so<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; that the entire blast arrives time-on-target?</i><br>
<p>
? This is what the shaped high explosives in an atomic bomb do already.<br>
