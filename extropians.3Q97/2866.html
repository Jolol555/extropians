I'm not belittling the horror of the Holocaust.  But the knowledge, skills,<br>
culture, art, and history of the Jewish people remain intact.  In 2 thousand<br>
years, the damage done by the Holocaust will be unnoticeable, just as nobody<br>
really cares anymore that Caesar killed over 2 million Gauls, deliberately<br>
and genocidally, during his conquest of Gaul.  But the destruction of the<br>
Library, and the other examples I cite, will never be replaced.  I feel their<br>
loss today, and 2 thousand years from now others (or hopefully me) still<br>
will.<br>
<p>
Hitler *wanted* to do something as bad as the examples I cited - eradicate<br>
the Jewish race, religion, and culture.  But, fortunately, he failed.<br>
 Alexander the Great and Cortes succeeded in similar endeavours.<br>
