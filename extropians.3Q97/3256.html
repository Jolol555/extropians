I'm no psychologist but in my experience (personal, first-hand,<br>
no_urban_legends_here) some individuals keep on fighting all the way and<br>
others just curl-up and accept their mortality.<br>
Last januari I was in the Andes, climbing Aconcagua. We evacuated a climber<br>
who had taken too little time to acclimatise to the thin air (about 50% of<br>
what you get at sea-level). This man (in his fifies) was having *severe*<br>
mountainsickness. He had cerebral edema and there was water in his lungs,<br>
causing further oxygen deprivation. His body temperature was below 30 deg<br>
centigrade and he had been in this state for several hours. It's a long<br>
walk from 6,000 meters down to basecamp (carrying a 150-pound package), and<br>
it took about 6 hours. At some point we thouht we'd lost him but then he<br>
opened his blood-shot eyes and croaked: "just get me home, first round of<br>
drinks on me"<br>
The basecampdoctor later told me that the guy should have been very dead,<br>
but he just refused to quit. He was fully recouperated after a week (and<br>
did buy us more drinks than we could manage).<br>
Our team summited a week later in good wheaterconditions, on the way back<br>
we saw two other climbers in trouble, they both had early mountainsickness<br>
symptoms and one had broken his leg. It was a bad situation but not<br>
directly life-treatening.<br>
We were busy preparing an improvised strecher when the guy with the broken<br>
leg became uncounsious and then stopped breathing. We went trough the whole<br>
drill to keep him alive. It didn't work. He died. I still do not understand<br>
why, and neither do the doctors and officals I talked to later. This was a<br>
very healty, young individual. No fatal wounds, no extreme hypothermia or<br>
oxygendeprivation.<br>
<p>
All this shows (to me anyway) how much more we have to learn about the<br>
interaction between basic bodyfunctions and the 'mind' (as in: the<br>
informationprocessing that happens in the brain).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;2)  Does anyone have any suggestions for what we can do to prevent this? </i><br>
<i> &gt;How many more of our luminaries will go gently, peacefully into oblivion</i><br>
<i> &gt;before we begin to stem the tide?  </i><br>
 ---<br>
<i> &gt;Marvin Minsky and Eric Drexler both finally signed up, and that makes me</i><br>
<i> &gt;feel better.  But I'm sure each of you can think of countless intellectual</i><br>
<i> &gt;influences whose cryonics membership status is non-existent or unknown. </i><br>
<i> &gt;What can we do about it, if anything?</i><br>
<p>
Maybe some people don't want to live forever, it sure isn't my top<br>
priority. I would like to live very long (forerver) but more than that I<br>
want to *live*, to do what I love doing most, even if it kills me (and<br>
since I'm not a 'luminarie' the world will keep on turning ;-).<br>
<p>
At this point the financial sacrifice I would have to make for signing-up a<br>
suspension contract (even if it was possible in Holland - Den Otter is<br>
working on that) doesn't justify the (IMHO) low probability of being<br>
restored to full functioning. If I have $50K to spare I'd rather use it on<br>
an Everest expedition or something else I can enjoy now, for certain, than<br>
investing it in a project with a low chance of succes.<br>
<p>
I can imagine that ceasing to exist could be acceptable if you feel you<br>
have lived a full life, if you are content with your accomplishments (not<br>
that I expext to be content soon, but somebody might be).<br>
<p>
Anders already said this:<br>
Improving life-extending technology and the spread of Exropian memes will<br>
help. Mainly we have to fight this idea of the inevitabililty of death so<br>
that people can make an informed choice.<br>

P.S.<br>
<i>   &gt;&gt; Since I know nothing for sure, nothing seems really unthinkable &lt;&lt;</i><br>
<p>
Methinks that this is a great line to put on any site aimed at introducing<br>
Transhuman / Extropian ideas to people who are new to them.<br>
Just a thought.<br>
