To Holly:<br>

<i>     &gt;I expect the skills I have now will be obsolete by the end of 98..</i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;I no longer have the time nor energy to gain new skills at the rate</i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;required by today’s free-market. I will probably be obsolete within</i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;2 years and dead with 5 unless something very *fundamental* changes</i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;from the free-market hell which is killing me. [...] help - I want</i><br>
  <br>
<i>        &gt;to live! I want to live in the amazing future that is unfolding.</i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;Shouldn’t everyone get an *EQUAL* chance to live well in the future?</i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;Otherwise aren’t extropians nazi’s - either by choice or by default?</i><br>
                  <br>
I understand this dilema all too well.  What is around the corner, however,<br>
are certain<br>
core technologies, which if harnessed and applied appropriately, can in fact<br>
become<br>
the instruments of empowerment, rather than a harbinger of defacto<br>
obsolescence<br>
cast upon the general population.  This is, in fact, the very essense of the<br>
evolutionary<br>
aspects of a series of threshold increments to be tested by, and hopefully, <br>
successfully negotiated, and responded to as becoming more robust entities.<br>
<p>
As one who is directly involved with the development of some of the integral<br>
components<br>
of an area of technology specifically embedded into this functionality matrix<br>
of the<br>
near future, it is precisely with you, and folks of a similar ilk, confronted<br>
with this <br>
dilema, that I temper my motivations and developmental trajectories with.<br>
<p>
Know this as truth . . . your scenario is indeed all to well understood, and<br>
acknowledged<br>
<p>
You will indeed be here, flourish, and relish in the experience of a world<br>
scarcely <br>
imagined by your predecessors.<br>
