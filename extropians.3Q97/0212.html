If Extropians view capitalism as the only accepted form of spontaneous<br>
order, then I don't have to think twice about leaving this list. I'd<br>
be glad to debate any of you one on one, though. Actually Virginia,<br>
there's another version of Robinson Crusoe. Yes, as a matter of fact it<br>
does involve a brush with psychosis. When did you start thinking that<br>
the way to mental health was easy? "But the priest did not turn to the<br>
west. He knew that the west was closer to the east, but thought that it<br>
was guarded by the columns of Hercules and uninhabited by people." <br>
