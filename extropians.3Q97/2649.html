The toadies you refer to would include the entire crew of some<br>
Naval vessel. As I recall, you were an Air Force crypto tech. Would<br>
you and your buddies in the Air Force have agreed to keep a secret<br>
equivalent to a shoot-down of this flight? I know my buddies at<br>
the Army communications center (I was an E5, MOS was 72F) would not.<br>
Why do you think the crew of that ship would keep quiet? These<br>
young sailors are fundamentally the same type of guys as you and I<br>
were at that age. (Well, OK, I admit that sailors are different, but<br>
not that way.)<br>
<p>
Sailors are young americans that are not much different from<br>
other young americans. This also applies to junior officers. If a <br>
missle have been fired from a ship that night, at least some of<br>
these guys would have seen it, and at least some "sea stories"<br>
would have leaked.<br>
<p>
Senior enlisted people and officers are somewhat older americans<br>
who aren't all that much different from other americans of the<br>
same age. You may argue that these guys have chosen to be<br>
facist oppressive Statists. It's possible that some match<br>
that description, but not the ones I've met.<br>
