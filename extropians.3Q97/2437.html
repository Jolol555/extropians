<i>&gt;  everybody can (and does) own guns, policing becomes dangerous as  hell,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  cops want bigger guns and more of them, and they will use them more</i><br>
often.<br>
<i>&gt;  In Holland NOBODY get's to own a gun unless there are special &gt; </i><br>
circumstances.<br>
<p>
Indeed, and this SUCKS! The crime rate isn't low at all in Holland, we<br>
(yes,<br>
I'm Dutch myself) have more than our fair share of muggings, rapes, murders<br>
(yes, including killer kids) etc, etc. The tough gun laws and the warped<br>
"pinky"<br>
criminal-loving justice system make sure that only the bad guys pack heat,<br>
and get only mildly punished (say, 3 years for murder) if punished at all<br>
(you<br>
know: lack of jailspace or a minor technicality error in the police report<br>
and<br>
things like that are enough to let 'em walk). Now if a law-abiding citizen<br>
*dares*<br>
to defend himself, his family and/or his property (even with his bare<br>
hands!) against  an assault by those "poor guys that had such a difficult<br>
childhood" [and<br>
hence had to turn to crime]....well, you've guessed it....he's in *deep*<br>
shit! <br>
The justice system will make sure that this horrible crime of "taking<br>
justice<br>
into your own hands" is dealt with swiftly and severely (they'll let a<br>
couple of<br>
child molesters walk, if necessary, to make sure that "this heinous<br>
criminal"<br>
is put away. I'm hardly exaggerating!). <br>
<p>
Example: a man caught some dude breaking into his house, and they get<br>
into a (fist)fight in which the home-owner broke his arm, but managed to<br>
knock the burgular unconscious. Now the owner is facing charges of<br>
attempted<br>
manslaughter, while the real criminal is out on the streets again (I<br>
believe he<br>
wants to file charges against his "attacker", and given the legal<br>
situation, he might very well win this case).<br>
<p>
Note: even pepper spray is illegal in Holland. Teargas is classified in the<br>
same<br>
category as flame throwers (!) and "unlawful" possession is punished<br>
accordingly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (yeah, yeah...does holland have an imigration problem or an emigration</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem?...that is ...are people trying to get in ..or get out...or</i><br>
neither?<br>
**Yes** we do have a immigration problem. Thanks to the pinky government<br>
policies the country is being *flooded* by poor immigrants from all corners<br>
of the world (but especially Turks, Moroccans which will probably result in<br>
Islam becoming the number one religion after the turn of the century, with<br>
as much as 50% (and eventually more) of Dutch citizens being Muslim.<br>
*They* breed a lot faster than "we" do. I guess we all know what happens<br>
to tolerance, progress and liberal ideas in general when Islam takes<br>
over...)<br>
The immigrants are responsible for a disproportionally great percentage of<br>
crimes (what a surprise!) according to recently published police statistics<br>
(there was quite a fuss about this, because the results weren't<br>
"politically<br>
correct". The sanctimonious Dutch are *very* squeamish when it comes to<br>
"ethnic issues", maybe even more than you guys...)<br>
<p>
Our great socialist social security is generous to the lazy opportunists<br>
(that's<br>
one of the main reasons why we're so popular with immigrants; they know),<br>
while at the same time it's harsh on the ("native") sick and elderly. <br>
<p>
<i> &gt;  We have LOTS of people trying to get in...and very few wanting to</i><br>
leave.<br>
Right! The only people trying to get *out* of Holland are the more<br>
successful<br>
(wealthier) ones, because of some of the highest taxes in the world (hey,<br>
*someone* has to finance the great parasite state!)<br>
<p>
Rant finished (for now). I hope y'all have a somewhat better understanding<br>
of<br>
my point of view after this. I still like Holland though, just hate the<br>
political/<br>
justice system. I've heard some countries want to copy our "model". My<br>
advice:<br>
*don't*.<br>
<p>
