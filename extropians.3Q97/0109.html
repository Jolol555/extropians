Dear Sir,                                    4 July 1997<br>
<p>
Further to my discussion with your Secretary this day, your 'Dr.' Babikar's <br>
actions, and the _continued_ actions of your staff even after the GMC's <br>
position was communicated to them, has damaged my health, and destroyed my <br>
confidence in the integrity of any 'treatment' you provide.<br>
<p>
<p>
Accordingly I will be lodging a further complaint with the GMC, and <br>
instituting legal proceedings against Southmead hospital/staff.<br>
<p>
I will be seeking to arrange more beneficial medical services, which would <br>
necessitate my freely-given and fulllly-informed consent, with full copies <br>
to me, of symptomatology, presenting problem, tentative diagnosis and <br>
suggested treatment plan, with ongoing monitoring as to side effects and <br>
efficacy. [For post-traumatic stress disorder ]<br>
<p>
You may expect delivery of all proceedings imminently.<br>
<p>
<p>
Yours faithfully,<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Tony Hollick<br>

[ The principal senior investigating officers at Criminal Intelligence <br>
Division, New Scotland Yard, are fully informed as to these matters, and it <br>
will be for the Crown Prosecution Service to consider the questions of <br>
illegal actions and threats by your staff, obstruction of justice and <br>
interference with witnesses.<br>

The relevant US-related matters are directly under consideration by the <br>
Office of the Chief Justice, the Supreme Court, United States of America.<br>

According to a Conservative Central Office staffer who used to work for <br>

As students of lojic and objective truth know, all that matters is the <br>
correspondence of statements with the facts.  'Psychology' or 'psychiatry' <br>
have nothing whatsoever to do with it. Neither does my 'state of mind.'<br>
