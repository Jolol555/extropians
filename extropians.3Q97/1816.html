Dear Judge Lau,                             12 August 1997<br>
<p>
Thank you so very much for your procedural help in enabling me to submit <br>
this brief to your Court, for the Hearing of 29 August (the birthday of <br>
Constitutional philosopher John Locke, by the way).<br>
<p>
<p>
There follows my amicus curiae brief in the case of Mary Kay Schmitz <br>
LeTourneau.  I am asking for further advice in the matter.   I am acting <br>
entirely independently, and on my own judgement.  I have no financial <br>
interest in the case.<br>
<p>
<p>
Relevant press reports are on file at:<br>
<p>
       http;//www.seatimes.com   (Seattle Times).<br>
<p>
All my hopes and dreams for America's future, and for the future of Mary <br>
Kay and her family, will be with you all on 29th August.<br>
<p>
Yours sincerely,<br>
<p>
Anthony Hugh Hollick<br>

<p>
Dear Special Agent Charon,                             10 August 1997<br>
<p>
Thank you so much for speaking with me concerning Dan Satterberg's (and <br>
others') vicious and most probably unlawful behaviour towards Mary Kay <br>
Schmitz LeTourneau and her family. I hope quite desperately that you can <br>
help her.<br>
<p>
<p>
This a matter of the utmost and immediate concern.  Mary Kay Schmitz <br>
LeTourneau is presently incarcerated at King County Jail, 620 West James, <br>
Kent, Washington 98023.  She has been assigned prisoner number 97-34198.<br>
It's a miracle she's still sane after months of quite inhuman persecution <br>
at the hands of Johnson, Satterburg et al.<br>
<p>
<p>
I am grievously reminded of the words of Deputy Attorney General Vincent <br>
Cuccia after the death of the American comedian Lenny Bruce at the hands <br>
of his team of prosecutors:<br>
<p>
"We drove him into poverty and bankruptcy; we watched him fall apart; we <br>
knew what we were doing: we used the law to kill him."  (Ernest van den <br>
Haag, later of the Heritage Foundation, was a prosecution witness in the <br>
matter).<br>

There follows a copy of the faxes sent to Satterburg and the Defense <br>
Attorneys prior to the (in my view, inexplicable) 'guilty' plea.'<br>
<p>
My full amicus curiae brief to the court for the August 29th Hearing will <br>
contain additional legal arguments and issues.<br>
<p>
<p>
I am fully willing to assist the courts and yourselves in this matter.<br>

<p>
Dear Mr. Satterburg, Mr. Maleng and Ms. Johnson,     5 August, 1997<br>
<p>
<p>
Please accept this as formal confirmation that (inter alia) I shall be <br>
filing an Amicus Curiae brief for consideration by the relevant courts in <br>
the case of:<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
     Mary Katherine Schmitz LeTourneau:  Ref: 97-1-015 23-1 . KNT<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
<p>
As I have discussed with you all on several occasions now, this case has <br>
grave human-rights and international relevance and implications, as well <br>
as raising profound legal, hmuman rights and social issues under the laws <br>
of the State of Washington and the United States itself<br>
<p>
I owe you a preliminary explanation for my direct personal involvement in <br>
this case.  This also constitutes a statement for the relevant official <br>
records.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[A] As explained to me by Mr. Dale Foreman of the Washington State <br>
Republican Committee, the prosecution is being brought to make an example <br>
of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau. This is unacceptable. Political 'Show <br>
Trials' and witch-hunts do not form any proper part of the American legal <br>
tradition.<br>
<p>
<p>
As Mr. Satterberg will well recall, I contrasted his and his colleagues' <br>
prosecutorial zeal in in hounding a harmless female school-teacher most <br>
unfavourably vis-a-vis his and his colleagues' seeming indifference and/or <br>
reluctance to go after Microsoft Corporation and its officers (based at <br>
Redmond in Seattle, well within King County jurisdiction) for prima facie <br>
grotesque breaches of United States laws, including (inter alia) the <br>
Charter of the National Security Agency itself.<br>
<p>
This is a matter of the utmost gravity for the constitutional rights of <br>
all American Windows95 users in the US and elsewhere, who have thus been <br>
rendered vulnerable to terrorist and criminal attack.<br>
<p>
<p>
[Note: This refers to Windows95 'backdoors'.:  it is now under active <br>
investigation by Mr. William Neukom, Chief Legal Executive of Microsoft <br>
Corporation, at my direct request. --AHH ].<br>
<p>
<p>
I pointed out very directly to Mr. Satterburg that many CIA and NSA <br>
staffers were well aware of (and outraged by) these matters, and he could <br>
perhaps start his invstigations by discussing these problems with them.<br>
<p>
<p>
Indeed, this whole Microsoft Corporation affair is a matter of direct <br>
and most basic concern to the entire North Atlantic Treaty Organization <br>
(NATO) and all its members.<br>
<p>
<p>
Inescapably obviously, Mr. Maleng and Mr. Satterburg are most unwilling to <br>
pursue grotesque legal infractions when they involve a major Seattle <br>
employer, powerful (and perhaps feared?) rogue elements in the intelligence <br>
and security services, and the many extremely rich and powerful interests <br>
who are gaining illicitly from criminal misconduct by enriching themselves <br>
via illegally obtained 'commercial intelligence.'<br>
<p>
<p>
'The Economist' writes: <br>
<p>
(p. 48, July 26th, 1977, "Inside the Belly of the Beast')"<br>
<p>
"When it comes to campaign finance, there is in fact a nasty, unspoken <br>
bipartisan consensus: that both parties are addicted to massive <br>
amounts of money, and they do not want to change the system that gives it <br>
to them."<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[B] The 'alternatives' presented to Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau (and the <br>
direct or indirect threats levelled against her) during the pre-trial <br>
interrogations constitute unapccptable coercion, and a violation of her <br>
rights, as well as an attempted pre-emption of the proper role of the <br>
courts.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[C] The Statute under which Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau is being accused <br>
constitutes a direct attack on the role of the Judiciary, as well as being <br>
in violation of accepted legal norms.  It is also -- in my view -- a <br>
Statute which violates the Separation of Powers by reason of the <br>
Legislature's attempting a usurpation of the the proper functions of the <br>
Judiciary to determine matters of fact, intention, and the moral content <br>
of actions.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[D] The Statute in question is quite certainly a gross example of that <br>
most evil legal positivism which characterized Nazi Germany and Stalin's <br>
USSR, whereby the 'law' was deemed to be whatever the State wanted it to <br>
be. The Statute therefore violates the jurisprudential bases and character <br>
of the entire United States legal system.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[E] The Prosecution _agrees_ that whatever took place between Mary Kay <br>
Schmitz LeTourneau and the then-13-year-old boy in the case took place <br>
without any element of coercion or other imposition of will being present. <br>
 Yet -- by direct analogy --  the Prosecution would seek to assert that <br>
(in Shakespeare's play) Romeo subjected Juliet to 'child rape', and -- in <br>
present-day Seattle -- would be coerced to plead 'guilty' to 'child rape' <br>
charges in direct and blatant contravention of the facts.<br>
<p>
Such coercion is _grossly_ improper, and is in itself tantamout to an <br>
interference with the accused's rights to plead and appeal directly to the <br>
relevant courts themselves.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[F] For a mother to be threatened with protracted and obligatory <br>
psychiatric intervention and coercion intended to 'cure' her of her love <br>
for her child's father is _completely unacceptable_ under all ethical and <br>
human-rights principles.  Such action would grossly violate the standards <br>
of medical ethics of the relevant professional bodies, and constitutes <br>
grounds for formal complaint thereto.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
[G] As I have previously stated, Mr. Satterberg, Mr. Maleng and Ms. <br>
Johnson will ineluctably be held directly and personally accountable for <br>
every aspect of their actions in this (and any other relevant) case.<br>
<p>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
A TIME FOR CHOOSING:<br>
<p>
Why should I (and many others) be so concerned by the vicious prosecution <br>
of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau (and others who have physically harmed or <br>
coerced no-one)?<br>
<p>
<p>
I can find no better words than these.<br>
<p>
<p>
   "You and I have a rendezvous with Destiny.  We can preserve for our <br>
children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we can sentence them <br>
to take the first step into a thousand years of darkness.  If we fail, at <br>
least let our children and our childrens' children say of us that we <br>
justified our brief moment here.  We did all that could be done."<br>
<p>
<p>
-- Ronald Wilson Reagan, addressing the Republican Convention in Phoenix, <br>
Arizona 33 years ago, on Barry Morris Goldwater's bid for the Presidency.<br>

"Freedom means doing whatever you damn well please." -- Barry Goldwater<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
Summary of Constitutional Amendment Issues:   12 August 1997<br>
<p>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
<p>
Amendment I<br>
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, <br>
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of <br>
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to <br>
assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of<br>
grievances.<br>
<p>
<p>
Contention: Mary Kay Schmitz Letourneau was required to have an abortion, <br>
mainly by reason of the racial origins of her baby, and her baby's father <br>
(Samoan/American)), notwithstanding that she was and is a Roman Catholic, <br>
and considers abortion impermissible on religious grounds.  She refused to <br>
kill her baby.  Had she had the abortion, there would have been no <br>
complaint by her husband's parents, and thus no case brought against her. <br>
This also is a clear abridgwement of relevant civil rights.<br>
<p>
<p>
In her attempted defense and pleadings, she is -- to the best of my <br>
understanding, knowledge and belief -- being threatened with reprisals <br>
against herself, her family (inter alia her baby, her older children and <br>
her baby's father).<br>
<p>
<p>
Amendment IV<br>
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, <br>
papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, <br>
shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable <br>
cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing <br>
the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.<br>
<p>
There appear to have been clear violations.<br>
<p>
<p>
Amendment V<br>
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise <br>
infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand <br>
jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the <br>
militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor <br>
shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in <br>
jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case <br>
to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or <br>
property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be <br>
taken for public use, without just compensation.<br>
<p>
This has clearly been grossly violated in this case.   The prosecution <br>
have pre-empted (or attempted to pre-empt) virtually every aspect of the <br>
'trial' proceedings, from plea right through to sentencing.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Amendment VI<br>
In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a <br>
speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and <br>
district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district <br>
shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of <br>
the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the <br>
witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining <br>
witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his <br>
defense.<br>
<p>
<p>
Clear violations.<br>
<p>
<p>
Amendment VIII<br>
Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, <br>
nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.<br>
<p>
<p>
To threaten a mother with (or inflict) forced psychiatric destruction of <br>
her love for her child's father is grotesquely cruel.  I must hope it is <br>
also unusual, in the USA at least.   I am consulting with Dr. Richard <br>
Ciccione, of the Americam Psychiatric Association Judicial Action <br>
Subcommittee on this, and with Dr. Peter Gruenberg, of the Ethics <br>
Committee for their statements concerning the 'psychiatric' aspects of <br>
the case, and the threatened penalties.<br>
<p>
<p>
Amendment IX<br>
The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be <br>
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.<br>
<p>
<p>
The right to found a family is expressly recognized by the United Nations <br>
Declaration of Human Rights (New York, 1947).<br>
