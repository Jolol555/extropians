Oh, absolutely!  Either God exists or It doesn't.  The Bible is either true or<br>
false.  I'm just reminding everyone that there are two sides to this argument<br>
and they do not think alike.  Nor is either method of thinking morally<br>
superior - although there are other methods of thinking which are definitely<br>
inferior, such as that which led to the Spanish Inquisition.  It is of course<br>
the case that that method of thinking which is factually *correct* is probably<br>
superior in some fashion.<br>
<p>
My point is simply that there is no need for xenophobic fear and hate in<br>
either direction, and that such xenophobia will likely lead to tragic and<br>
comic efforts by their side to prevent the Singularity even as they wait<br>
patiently for Armageddon.  Or needless attacks on people of quiet faith and<br>
goodness on an issue that's about to be resolved anyhow, just because no other<br>
way of thinking can be tolerated.<br>
<p>
One side wants to serve God.  One side wants to become God.  Are the deeds<br>
that are likely to result really incompatible?  Why offend people who could be<br>
our natural allies?  Any reasonably intelligent religious person can see that<br>
the Singularity is Armageddon, the coming of the Messiah, or Arafel.  We don't<br>
even have to claim it in order to garner support; we need merely respect the<br>
postulates that lead them to support us.<br>
<p>
Some of them will be happy to help us, and particularly to defuse any reflex<br>
panic at AI or IA - as long as nobody attacks these perfectly good people out<br>
of xenophobia.  I have seen *vicious* attacks on religion - not necessarily by<br>
anybody in this thread, but vicious nonetheless.<br>
<p>
You don't have to believe them.  You don't have to agree with them.  You don't<br>
have to like their mental methods or what looks like "doublethink".  Just<br>
respect the good ones for the good they do, and _don't_argue_ about Ultimate<br>
Issues that can quite safely be handed down to our more intelligent future selves.<br>
