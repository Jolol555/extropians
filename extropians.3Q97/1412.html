<i>&gt; It is well known to people who take hallucinogens that it is possible to</i><br>

<i>&gt; informative.</i><br>
<p>
While I believe there may be some anatomical evidence for some of this,<br>
the reports of hallucinators are not reliable.  They may be simply<br>
mistaken about the nature of the experiences they are having.<br>
<p>
Some philosophers would argue that it is impossible for someone to be<br>
mistaken about the nature of his perceptions, but I disagree.  If a<br>
hallucinator thinks he is seeing a purer red than he has ever seen before,<br>
it could be that in some sense the red is actually the same as what he<br>
has always seen, but that part of his mind which judges purity is not<br>
working properly.  Similarly, if he thinks he is seeing a mandala of<br>
infinite fractal complexity, and is simultaneously perceiving every<br>
minute detail far beyond the resolution he is normally capable of,<br>
again I would suggest that he may be simply misjudging how much detail<br>
he is actually perceiving.<br>
<p>
The same thing happens when the hallucinator hits upon a thought which<br>
strikes him as incredibly meaningful and insightful.  Often, in the<br>
aftermath, he realizes that the idea was actually rather prosaic.<br>
<p>
What all these cases have in common is that the part of the mind which<br>
evaluates the nature of the perception seems to be affected, so that the<br>
perception is judged as being more "special" than it actually is.<br>
<p>
This is not to argue that all hallucinatory reports are mistaken, simply<br>
that we cannot take them at face value given that the brain is not working<br>
normally.<br>
