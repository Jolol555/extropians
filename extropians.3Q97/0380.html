Subject: CFP: Learning in Autonomous Robots<br>
<p>
Dear Colleague,<br>
<p>
Maja Mataric and I are guest editing a special issue of Prof. George<br>
Bekey's Autonomous Robots Journal. Please review our CFP which is salo<br>
available online.<br>
<p>

<p>
                           Call for papers<br>
                        Autonomous Robots Journal<br>
             Special Issue on Learning in Autonomous Robots<br>
<p>
             Guest editors:  Henry Hexmoor and  Maja Mataric<br>
<p>
                 Submission Deadline: August 15, 1997 <br>
<p>
Autonomous Robots is an international journal published by Kluwer<br>
Academic Publishers, Editor-in-Chief: George Bekey<br>
<p>
<p>
Current applications of machine learning in robotics explore learning<br>
behaviors such as obstacle avoidance, navigation, gaze control, pick<br>
and place operations, manipulating everyday objects, walking,<br>
foraging, herding, and delivering objects. It is hoped that these are<br>
first steps toward robots that will learn to perform complex<br>
operations ranging from folding clothes, cleaning up toxic waste and<br>
oil spills, picking up after the children, de-mining, look after a summer<br>
house, imitating a human teacher, or overseeing a factory or a space<br>
mission.<br>
<p>
As builders of autonomous embedded agents, researchers in robot<br>
learning deal with learning schemes in the context of physical<br>
embodiment. Strides are being made to design programs that change<br>
their initial encoding of know-how to include new concepts as well as<br>
improvements in the associations of sensing to acting. Driven by<br>
concerns about the quality and quantity of training data and real-time<br>
issues such as sparse and low-quality feedback from the environment,<br>
robot learning is undergoing a search for quantification and<br>
evaluation mechanisms, as well as for methods for scaling up the<br>
complexity of learning tasks.<br>
<p>
This special issue of Autonomous Robots will focus on novel robot<br>
learning applications and quantification of learning in autonomous<br>
robots. We are soliciting papers describing finished work preferably<br>
involving real manipulator or mobile robots. We invite submissions<br>
from all areas in AI and Machine Learning, Mobile Robotics, Machine<br>
Vision, Dexterous Manipulation, and Artificial Life that address robot<br>
learning.<br>
<p>
Submitted papers should be delivered by August 15, 1997. For a small<br>
extension or problems with submission please contact contact Henry<br>
Hexmoor as soon as possible.<br>
<p>
Manuscripts should be typed or laser-printed in English (with American<br>
spelling preferred) and double-spaced. Both paper and electronic<br>
submission are possible, as described below.  <br>
<p>
For paper submissions, send five (5) copies of submitted papers<br>
(hard-copy only) to:<br>
