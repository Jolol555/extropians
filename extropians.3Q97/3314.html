<i>&gt;From CNN Headline News today:</i><br>
<p>
"Some entrepreneurs are salivating over the prospect of finding gold,<br>
platinum, cobalt and other valuable resources in space. James W. Benson<br>
has established the company SpaceDev, and says he plans to launch a<br>
robot craft to an asteroid to take photographs, scientific readings,<br>
and to prospect for mining sites. "Space is a place, not a government<br>
project," Benson told reporters Wednesday in Washington. He needs more<br>
money to finance his $50 million mission, but doesn't want any from the<br>
government."<br>
<p>
Go, man, go!,<br>
