Wow! I have some questions on this:<br>
<p>
Were any wreath-shaped quipu found? These might be monthly or <br>
yearly calendars. Planting and harvesting might be represented by<br>
a pendant string, for example. An astronomical calendar should be <br>
recognizable, and decipherable.<br>
<p>
Were any fids, needles, combs with widely-spaced teeth, or odd-looking<br>
frameworks found in the graves that held the quipu?<br>
<p>
Any children's graves found? These may hold the equivalent of a<br>
grammar book.<br>
<p>
Are some of the knots of a kind that can be easily moved along the string<br>
(e.g. the simple overhand knot)? These would allow updating the record.<br>
Loosening the knot with a fid, then sliding it along the string with the fid,<br>
pulling the ends to re-set the knot. Are three any beads on the quipu that<br>
might perform the same function (beads can encode more local information <br>
than a knot, like the icons below)?<br>
What type is the primary knot?<br>
<p>
Have any knot theorists studied these things?<br>
<p>
Are there cross-links from one branched structure to another? These may <br>
indicate interrelationships, or simple keep the structure organized. It seems<br>
to me a large and complicated quipu might have had an associated framework.<br>
Alternatively, they might have been suspended on several threads from<br>
something that looks like a small gallows.<br>
<p>
The knotted string construct you describe has the ability to store information <br>
in a multi-variable (multi-dimensional) fashion. Several knotted strings tied <br>
together at a single point may represent many different aspects of the <br>
same thing.<br>
<p>
The efficacy of this system of representation may have hampered the<br>
development of the written word.<br>
<p>
I have dabbled with various means of representing information in a 3D<br>
construct. My latest effort is a 3D animated scheduler- icons stand or <br>
march along a time axis, priorities and other variables on the other<br>
two axes. The icons code for various kinds of projects and activities, <br>
colored lines (!) connect between them to indicate interrelationships. <br>
It is unfortunately entirely visual,  although audio could be added<br>
(e.g. click an icon for a spoken description).<br>
<p>
The tactile (in addition to the visual) nature of the quipu is, I think, a decided<br>
advantage- something I argued for on a recent panel discussing VR<br>
applications. I was shouted down (by Howard Davidson, no less) based <br>
on the amount of the brain devoted to visual vs. tactile processing. I would <br>
now argue that this ratio is a recent development, that primitives (like me) <br>
have a somewhat different ratio, weighted more towards the physical. This <br>
is a testable hypothesis.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, much of my inventive work involves conceptually _feeling_,<br>
or _being_ the thing, as opposed to looking at it from the outside.<br>
Einstein spoke of a similar method, I think he called it “muscle knowledge”.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;        Have you ever heard of the quipu of preColumbian Peru?</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you have, it's a minor miracle.   The  archives of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Incan quipu were burned by the Spanish conquerors, after</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Council of Lima in the year 1583.   There are about</i><br>
<i>&gt; 400 authentic quipus left in the entire world.   Every</i><br>
<i>&gt; last one of the quipus we possess nowadays was dug out of</i><br>
<i>&gt; a human grave.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;        No one today seems to have any real idea how these</i><br>
<i>&gt; quipu worked.  They all looked more or less like this one</i><br>
<i>&gt; -- they had a thick fabric backbone, with a series of</i><br>
<i>&gt; dependent fringes.  But the fringes could also have</i><br>
<i>&gt; fringes.  Sometimes there were as many as six</i><br>
<i>&gt; subdirectories coming off the backbone of the network.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They had a variety of different knots.  They had quite a</i><br>
<i>&gt; wide variety of colors.  People have only the vaguest</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas what the colors may have signified.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;        The Inca economic system was a centralized command</i><br>
<i>&gt; economy.   A third of the nation's economic output was</i><br>
<i>&gt; stored in vast ranks of stone cells.  Everything down to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the last sandal was recorded on quipu.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;        I don't think there was ever an alphabet in quipu.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't think that the Inca were literate in that fashion,</i><br>
.  But there may have been geneologies in string --<br>
<i>&gt; hierarchies, maybe family trees.  Maps, even -- three</i><br>
<i>&gt; days' journey, they forded a blue river, they fought a red</i><br>
<i>&gt; battle -- you can imagine how usefully suggestive this</i><br>
<i>&gt; might have been.  Maybe you could attack language even</i><br>
<i>&gt; more directly with a quipu:   meter, stress, quantity,</i><br>
<i>&gt; pitch, length of the poem -- why should this be hard to</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe?   In English we sometimes call telling a story</i><br>
<i>&gt; "spinning a yarn."</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...  When a</i><br>
<i>&gt; quipucamayoc read one of these recording devices, I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; think his lips moved.   There was nothing crude or halting</i><br>
<i>&gt; or primitive or painful about the experience -- a quipu is</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainly a  more tactile and sensual and three-</i><br>
<i>&gt; dimensional experience than a book.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;        The quipu was a medium.  It was a way to cast the</i><br>
<i>&gt; world into an entire new form of order.  It was a medium</i><br>
<i>&gt; invented by and for a very careful and methodical people,</i><br>
