MLorton; Thank you for responding.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; The point is that - under positivist laws -- the prosecution has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (absolutist) powers are conferred by the 'legislation'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is no *other* legal theory that has a different result.</i><br>
<p>
Yes there are -- several.  But the problem is made very difficult by the <br>
lack of internal and external metrics (see my CIX 'Liberty' (NCCL) <br>
conference essay).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; If we concede that there are people who are too young to consent to sex, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; are stuck with defining a statutory age (or else trying to establish</i><br>
<i>&gt; majority on a case-by-case basis, a much worse outcome).</i><br>
<p>
We can establish a civil-law rights-based approach, which provides for a <br>
_presumption_ of incapacity to give informed consent below a defined age <br>
(or alternatively, a set of objective parameters).  The Courts (and the <br>
judge) could test the validity of the presumption if it is challenged by <br>
the older or the younger party.  Kids have rights, too.  Deprive them of <br>
the right to say 'yes' and there saying 'no' becomes rather less valuable <br>
and worthy of respect.  That's part of the problem.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; One could conceive of monstrously unjust laws of all descriptions.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; question is, is this law which is actually in force unjust and if so,</i><br>
<i>&gt; why.</i><br>
<p>
See (inter alia) my Amicus Curiae briefs to Judge Linda Lau's Court.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is a difference between the conviction and the sentence.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; sentence in this case seems (to me) egregious to the point of</i><br>
<i>&gt; unconstitutionality.  She should have gotten probation and lost her</i><br>
<i>&gt; licence to teach.</i><br>
<p>
The statute and the prosecution are unlawful and unconstitutional.  She <br>
should walk free from the Court on August 29.  And we need every good <br>
teacher we can get, especially looking at the poor shape the world's in right now.<br>
<p>
I've proposed that she teach again via the Internet and multimedia.<br>
<p>
Best Wishes,<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
OK.<br>
<p>
This is not a 'popular' case to argue (civil liberties seldom are).<br>
<p>
There's an academic study, 'Child Loving' written by (ISTR) William <br>
Kinkaid [publ. RKP]  which I haven't read.<br>
<p>
Let's look at this seriously.<br>
<p>
Firstly, at a methodological level:  (Pardon my French!)<br>
<p>
<p>
Following logician Alfred Tarski, we can say:<br>
<p>
"The statement 'Les pedophiles sont particulierement dangereuse aux les <br>
membres de public' is thrue if -- and only if - paedophiles are, in fact, <br>
particularly dangerous to members of the public."   Ironically, such <br>
relationships are known in France as 'Special friendships.'  There's a <br>
novel of that name, by Roger de Peyrefitte, which is on this topic.  No <br>
sex in it, BTW.<br>
<p>
<p>
We do not have a good statistical basis for knowing how many members of <br>
the population are 'paedophiles.'  The American Academic Hypertext <br>
Encyclopaedia by Grolier [1993] describes people who find pre-pubescent <br>
children sexually attractive.  But consider: such preferences are not <br>
binary.  They range from people being completely erotically indifferent to <br>
pre-pubescent children, through to finding them (or some of them -- but <br>
which? One?  All of them?) sexually _irresistable_.<br>
<p>
<p>
Sexual attraction can only properly apply to a reproductive context. So <br>
we're not dealing with sexuality at all -- pre-pubescent girls cannot <br>
reproduce, and boys and men cannot reproduce at all, except with fertile <br>
females.<br>
<p>
So we're really considering unilateral eroticism -- an internally <br>
experienced erotic attraction, which ranges from (say) zero to a hundred <br>
percent -- we have no _metric_ for it, anyway -- and reciprocated erotic <br>
interactions - an exchange of intellectual and sensory experience.<br>
<p>
But erotic feelings are internally-experienced 'World II' phenomena -- <br>
again, there is no external metric.  And they can therefore have _no <br>
impact whatsoever on other people_ (except insofar as other people can <br>
sense them at some tacit level).<br>
<p>
Insofar as pre-pubescent children actually have no capacity -- knowledge and <br>
experience -- of and for for erotic arousal, they can hardly either sense <br>
it in other people, or understand it either.<br>
<p>
So we just don't know.  The positivist assertion must therefore be false.<br>
<p>
But is it objectively true, all unbeknownst to us?<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
Cut to the chase.<br>
<p>
<p>
People are understandably very concerned about strangers who forcibly <br>
inflict unwanted physical assaults (of varying degrees of severity) on <br>
children who never sought out such behaviour.  But this is very rare -- in <br>
the case of grave genital or anal assaults.  <br>
<p>
Insofar as grave physical abuse by strangers _does_ occur, it <br>
predominantly occurs in situations where the children are deprived of <br>
liberty -- i.e. in childrens' 'homes' and [coercive-type] schools.  There <br>
is much empirical evidence for this.  Vastly more grave assaults on <br>
children (genital and/or anal) occur at the hands of their parents, in the <br>
home: people who have 'legitimate' power over them.<br>
<p>
In almost all cases, these assaults can actually be completely prevented <br>
and stopped, and children need no longer suffer, or -- like Jonbenet Ramsey, <br>
aged 6, be hideously tortured and then murdered.<br>
<p>
<p>
[ August 19 1997 Note:  I'm an adviser to the Boulder, Colorado District <br>
Attorney's Office in the JonBenet Ramsey case  Either -- vastly unlikely <br>
-- one or other of her parents killed her, or -- vastly more probable -- <br>
it was a carefully [plannned political] 'demonstration' killing, carried <br>
out by paid psychopaths.  The investigating authorities are not making it <br>
very easy to discover the facts in this matter].  Time will tell.<br>
<p>
<p>
Asking 'What powerful and unpleasant people has John Ramsey upset?' might <br>
prove a fruitful line of inquiry.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
        The real-world solution is simple:  equip all children with <br>
personalized miniature radio 'search-and-rescue' beacons, activated in <br>
crisis situations and emitting a personalized radio alarm signal,  This <br>
can be instantly picked up, the source location triangulated and given <br>
Global Positioning Coordinates, and appropriate rescue services sent to <br>
the scene immediately, by the fastest possible means.<br>
<p>
        The small units can be worn as pendants, bracelets, on a belt.  <br>
Anywhere accessible to the child should they be in a crisis situation.  <br>
Taining children to use them is simple. They're very cheap to manufacture. <br>
Come to think of it, we could all do with these -- it results in <br>
incident-driven policing at the behest of the person under threat. This <br>
would be most fruitful in reconfiguring policing to be a system of <br>
delegated self-defence, rather than a means of social control operated by <br>
the governing hierarchical authorities.<br>
<p>
Microlert was offering such a service for US $30 a year in California, in <br>
the Seventies.  <br>
<p>
Advocates of authoritarian and violent parenting and schooling (Gillick, <br>
Howard, Shephard) _hate and detest_ this sort of idea, which is now <br>
actually being made available to children under threat within their <br>
homes, in America...<br>
<p>
Ask yourself why it is, that the 'authorities' seem to have so little <br>
concern for the phyical, psychological and emotional well-being of each <br>
and every one of us -- children _and_ adults.<br>
<p>
The exaggerated 'AIDS' propaganda backfired on the 'moral' authoritarians, <br>
resulting in a vast proliferation of erotic non-penetrative activity -- <br>
so-called 'safe sex.'<br>
<p>
The social-control freaks are _really pissed off_ about this failure.  A  <br>
lot of effort and resources went into the scare.<br>
<p>
Stuff called BHT (E321) -- a near-perfectly-safe food preservative and <br>
anti-oxidant -- zaps all lipid-coated viruses it's so far been tesed on, <br>
in 250 mg. oral daily doses. No side-effects, no immunocompromize effects.<br>
<p>
It's generic, and sells for around five bucks a kilo.<br>
<p>
Do a WWW search on 'Fowkes' and 'BHT'<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
The idea of children remaining 'innocent' in the context of modern <br>
tobacco, confectionery and newspaper shops is quite risible, insofar as <br>
there are all that many children incapable of erotic responses left. Go <br>
look at the magazine racks in any shop. Just look at the cover pictures <br>
and text.<br>
<p>
        Orchestrated witch-hunts against mostly harmless and inoffensive <br>
people is much nearer what the 'authorities seem to want to go in for.  <br>
Coercion. Wonder why?<br>
<p>
No civil libertarian should have much of a problem answering that: -- <br>

<p>
I'm hardly any kind of  'paedophile' -- my idea of 'attractive' is the <br>
glorious Olivia Newton-John.  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
But I did see my best friend lying in a mortuary, with ice crystals on his <br>
face, stone dead.  He liked emotional involvemet with -- and on occasion <br>
mutual erotic play with -- good-looking boys between the ages of twelve <br>
and fourteen.  They seemed to welcome it, AFAIK.  If I'd had any reason to <br>
think that they didn't, he wouldn't have been a friend of mine for a <br>
moment longer.<br>
<p>
<p>
With me was another good friend with similar inclinations.  He went on to <br>
become a top Royal Navy carrier pilot and a gifted 'TOP GUN' air combat <br>
trainer.  He trained to fly one-way nuclear mission against the USSR -- <br>
which would have killed and maimed million of people, had been ordered to <br>
do it.  Quite futile, too -- when someone asked 'but we haven't the fuel <br>
capacity to get back, they were told: "What do you think will be left here <br>
to get back to?"<br>
<p>
He ceased to have any interest in younger boys as he grew older, but is <br>
still an 'out' gay in Oz.<br>
<p>
<p>
I have no reason to think that either of them ever did any kind of harm to <br>
anyone.  I don't have friends who are like that.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
One of the parents resented their son's attachment to my best friend, and <br>
'sweated' a 'confession' out of their son... The police were summoned, <br>
and very commendably seemed suprisingly unconcerned, and he was charged <br>
with 'indecent exposure', ISTR.  However, they told him he couldn't expect <br>
to go on 'doing it.'<br>
<p>
All too true.<br>
<p>
<p>
A little later, he was found dead by his mother and sister.<br>

Address the issues.<br>
<p>
If you think you have an  argument, that is,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Oh -- one statement was OK</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;not a 'popular' case to argue</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Indeed it's not, and it is pretty obvious why it is unpopular -- and </i><br>
<i>&gt;quite rightly too.</i><br>
<p>
That's the sort of response that says:<br>
<p>
<p>
"We prefer killing people, destroying their lives. creating a climate of <br>
terror, letting children suffer and die, instead of PREVENTING CHILDREN <br>
BEING HARMED BY GIVING THEM FREE RADIO PANIC ALARMS as these trounlesome <br>
defenders of unpopular cases keep telling us to."<br>
<p>
<p>
Mustn't let the _children_ decide, and be in command of their own defence <br>
in these matters, must we now?<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, kids are suffering and dying, almost entirely at the hands of <br>
adults who are known to them (including their parents), an an oppotunity <br>
to extend draconian controls by the State goes unopposed -- by you, <br>
anyway.  For practical purposes, you're encouraging one of the worst <br>
outbreaks of 'moral panic' for a hundred years, with dire 'knock-on' <br>
effects on everyone's fundamental civil liberties.<br>
<p>
That seems to be acceptable to you.<br>
<p>
What the hell are you doing _here_, posturing as being concerned about <br>
civil liberties -- including the rights of children to say 'yes' and 'no' <br>
and have their wishes respected and enforced.  That's what all this is <br>
really about.<br>
