 It is my view that the time has come for government to get out of <br>

The 1997 Space Commercialization Act is supposed to remove this <br>
de facto obstacle. Read G. Harry Stine's "Halfway to Anywhere"<br>
for various tales of NASA, et al, ancien regime.<br>

They do indeed exist, though the situation is very fluid now.<br>
Foreign competition has been very helpful.<br>

Here's an item of interest from Lawrence Roberts. <br>
This web site's Library of Space treaties is absolutely great! (if <br>
you're into that sort of thing, like I am)<br>

Subject: Space Law &amp; Policy Web Site<br>
<p>
I am pleased to announce the formation of The Archimedes Institute, a<br>
policy research organization devoted to the efficient and equitable<br>
development of the solar system.  The Archimedes Institute is working to<br>
improve the legal and policy climate of the space sector through the<br>
generation and dissemination of reasoned policy analysis, the <br>
enhancement<br>
of communication between government, academia, the commercial sector and<br>
the general public, and the implementation of private policy initiatives<br>
such as a registry for private claims to solar system resources.<br>
<p>
Check out the Institute's web site at <br>
<a href="http://www.permanent.com/archimedes/">http://www.permanent.com/archimedes/</a>.<br>
 <br>
<p>
In addition to the FREE claims registry, the site offers full texts of<br>
international agreements, national legislation and a variety of articles<br>
and other materials from its library as well as over a hundred links to <br>
a<br>
wide variety of space related organizations and resources.<br>
<p>
The Archimedes Institute has been awarded NSS's S.P.A.C.E. Site of the <br>
Week<br>
for Sept. <br>
20-27!<br>
<p>
Lawrence Roberts<br>
Director<br>
