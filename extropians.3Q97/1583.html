Your first paragraph, below, makes several points. The relation between<br>
them is not clear to me, but I'll address them one by one.<br>
     <br>
<i>&gt;     Why do you find it hard to see that the man's view of life extension </i><br>
<i>&gt;     involves the relinquishing of acquired self-hood? </i><br>
<p>
How is this supposed to work? Perhaps I'm missing something, but<br>
relinquishing all selfhood all at once at the time of biological death<br>
looks to me like a terrible way to pursue life extension. As far as I know,<br>
Clarke doesn't believe in a non-physical afterlife. (Another SF giant,<br>
Robert Heinlein, apparently did and so that's why *he* rejected<br>
cryonics--that and the dislike of his wife Virginia for cryonics.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      It tends to be for </i><br>
<i>&gt;     the pro-cryonics crowd the ultimate holy grail (pardon the religious </i><br>
<i>&gt;     pun) that the body and the self are unconditionally joined.  </i><br>
<p>
I don't what this has to do with the foregoing point. Also, it sounds false<br>
to me as a generalization. No one can accurately speak for all cryonicists,<br>
but after over a decade of involvement, I have a good feel for how many<br>
cryonicists think. Not only are many of us planning on being suspended<br>
head-only (neuropreservation), but many of us expect to either be revived<br>
as uploads or make that transition soon after. (Assuming we don't live long<br>
enough to upload without a period of suspension.) Uploads will have no<br>
single body, and will need no one physical location to exist. The many<br>
cryonicists who favor uploading therefore do *not* see the self and body as<br>
"unconditionally joined". Except, of course, in the sense that software has<br>
to have physical computers on which to run (but not any single computer or<br>
location).<br>
<p>
The issues surrounding the contribution of body to personal identity are<br>
complex. If you're interested, I refer you to my doctoral dissertation on<br>
personal identity, especially the last chapter:<br>
<a href="http://www.primenet.com/~maxmore/disscont.htm">http://www.primenet.com/~maxmore/disscont.htm</a><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     I have no </i><br>
<i>&gt;     interest in cryonics and it has nothing to do with fear.  </i><br>
<p>
What does it have to do with? Do you think it won't work? Or do you have<br>
faith in an afterlife?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     But a person </i><br>
<i>&gt;     with the intelligence that Clarke has and the vision that he has time </i><br>
<i>&gt;     and time again most aptly conveyed to the world doesn't seem to match </i><br>
<i>&gt;     up to the judgment you would assign him.</i><br>
<p>
There are many brilliant people who have made amazing contributions who,<br>
nevertheless, make major mistakes in their thinking. My comments are Clarke<br>
are based on the little I've heard about his views. I would love to discuss<br>
them with him in person.<br>
     <br>
<i>&gt;     Clarke may find that cryonics, despite any compelling empirical </i><br>
<i>&gt;     evidence, is just a quaint notion, like a child not wanting to give up </i><br>
<i>&gt;     his belief in Santa Claus.  It's not so much the preservation of </i><br>
<i>&gt;     body/brain that cryonics promotes but the restoration/reactivation of </i><br>
<i>&gt;     a pre-existing "self".  This alludes to self being completely </i><br>
<i>&gt;     electro-chemical in nature.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     To that I pose the question: what of the person who suffers </i><br>
<i>&gt;     irrecoverable amnesia, forgeting all memories of the former life </i><br>
<i>&gt;     including intimate relationships, even children.  Did that "person" </i><br>
<i>&gt;     die?  Who know is in charge of the body of that person?</i><br>
<p>
If the person not only lost all memories but also their values,<br>
dispositions, and beliefs, then I would say that person had ceased to<br>
exist. If a new personality develops or is implanted somehow, a new<br>
individual is now embodied in that body. The self is not identical with the<br>
body or even the brain, but with the information embodied and how it is<br>
processed.<br>
     <br>
<i>&gt;     On the other hand, look the people documented in the book/film </i><br>
<i>&gt;     "Awakenings".  Time stopped for these people, sometimes for decades, </i><br>
<i>&gt;     until they were brought back to life (mentally).  The thing was, </i><br>
<i>&gt;     during their zombie-like state, their physical lives were continuing.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;     A cryonically preserved body/head may be regarded as living.  I think </i><br>
<i>&gt;     a distinction between preserved and living is yet to be made.</i><br>
<p>
That's incorrect. Cryonicists have made that distinction for years. I've<br>
described such a state as "inactivate" and it's usually been called<br>
"deanimate". I wrote a column for Cryonics magazine years ago. One dealing<br>
with this issue was called "The Third State". I can email you it (after the<br>
conference) if you like.<br>
