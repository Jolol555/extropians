This is something I simply don't understand.  How can anyone believe that<br>
enforcing laws that favour one person over another is 'ethical?'<br>
<p>
Here's an example:<br>
<p>
You have two people, an able bodied man, and a disabled man.  We currently<br>
don't have the technology to fix the legs of the disabled man so that he can<br>
walk.  So, in order to create equality we must break the legs of our able<br>
bodied man.  In the future we may be able to fix the legs of both men, but<br>
are these breakthroughs more likely to come from one able bodied man and one<br>
disabled man, or two disabled men?<br>
<p>
Ethics are the product of selfish guilt, "If *I* were in his shoes."  They<br>
generally do more harm than good (I'm sure Hitler thought he was very<br>
ethical.)<br>
