Rick Knight wrot:<br>

<i>&gt;       I watched a documentary about women and witchcraft through the Middle</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       Ages up to the beginning of the Renaissance.  It is *estimated* that </i><br>
<i>&gt;       some 9 million women were put to death during the European and </i><br>
<i>&gt;       American witchhunts to stamp on wicca and pagan memes in favor of the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       patriarchal institution of Roman Catholicism (I shant call it </i><br>
<i>&gt;       Christianity if only to make the distinction).</i><br>
<p>
Off the subject, but..  I'm currently working on a fictional screenplay about<br>
mordern-day witchhunts (it's actually a satire on the way the government<br>
treats drugs, capital punishment and law, but don't tell anyone until *after*<br>
the contracts are signed).  The screenplay's as finished as the rest of them,<br>
but I'm working on some test footage to woo potential producers.  After which<br>
I'm going to work on _the big secret extropian project_, which will be<br>
closely followed by the _even bigger pro-anarchy project_.  The witchhunter<br>
project is all shaping up nicely, lots of acidic dark humour, a good story<br>
line and strong social comments.  And when I get the test reel done, add<br>
unique directing and great cinematography.  The biggest problem I'm having<br>
with it is trying to avoid the temptation to have a "there was witchcraft<br>
after all" ending, the potential special effects could be great, but it would<br>
spoil the message.<br>
<p>
--Wax<br>
<p>
P.S. The big secret extropian project is currently lacking in the story area,<br>
so I've spared you any details, but I've got some good visuals lined up (I'll<br>
soon be creating a computer generated short as part of the uploading scene.)<br>
 The even bigger pro-anarchy project is just *huge*, has the fullest story of<br>
them all and cannot be produced on anything less than _the worlds biggest<br>
bugget_, hence the reason I'm waiting until after I've made something,<br>
producers don't tend to produce big movies from unknown losers (for some<br>
reason!)<br>
<p>
Oh.. and hope I didn't offend anyone with the title change.<br>
