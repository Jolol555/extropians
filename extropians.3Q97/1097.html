I have no problem in principle with the existance of statists like<br>
AMG. AMG is free to continue believing his attempts and those of<br>
others to regulate people's lives to be "good for them" or whatever he<br>
wishes. On the other hand, I'd frankly prefer that he not hang around<br>
here if that's what he believes.<br>
<p>
Occassionally, I find it interesting to actually debate things with<br>
statists. That is to say, I occassionally enjoy demolishing their<br>
arguments, and since their arguments are nearly always very poor, this<br>
is not very stressful. However, I tend to pick the time and place for<br>
such things when *I* wish to do so, not when others do.<br>
<p>
The question has been brought up "is this a clubhouse or a recruitment<br>
effort". It's obviously a clubhouse, or at least was originally<br>
intended as such. I must admit that the original intent might not<br>
matter, and that many institutions evolve and that answering a fuzzy<br>
non-eprime question like "what IS this thing we call the extropians<br>
list" isn't even possible.<br>
<p>
However, for those that care what my original intent was, back in the<br>
mists of time, when I asked Max for permission to open the doors on<br>
the electronic discussion ground for readers of "Extropy" magazine,<br>
I'll re-iterate it:<br>
<p>
The world is a big, dark cold place full of statists, deathists,<br>
Rifkinites, etc. Every day, all of us do battle with that world, in<br>
greater or lesser ways. Every once in a while, its nice to kick off<br>
the shoes and have some intelligent discussion with people who<br>
basically agree with you. There are VAST areas of unexplored terrain<br>
just within the "extropian sphere". How *do* you deal effectively<br>
with things like the defense problem in an anarchist framework? What<br>
are possible strategies for creating the first assemblers? Are there<br>
nootropics that are actually of real use? (Those just off the top of<br>
my head without any real pause for thinking.) Sure there are places<br>
for discussing all this stuff elsewhere, but they are vastly<br>
outnumbered by the number of places where even mentioning you're an<br>
anarchist or mentioning you are trying to live at least as long as<br>
the unverse continues will get you hostility.<br>
<p>
There is also the issue of pure cameraderie. Simon Levy recently<br>
mentioned to me that the biggest tangible long-term benefit to him of<br>
the Extropians mailing lists was the set of long term friendships he<br>
forged through it with like-minded people, and I tend to agree with<br>
him there. I can meet statists like AMG any time or place I like --<br>
how easy is it, though, to meet fellow anarchocryonicists?<br>
<p>
Lastly, there are a lot of things I've legitimately learned through<br>
exposure to lots of other smart people who basically share my world<br>
view, and lots of opportunities I've gained over time to refine my<br>
ideas and in some cases alter or abandon them. Although one might not<br>
think it, my viewpoints on a lot of topics, and many of my practical<br>
every-day attitudes, changed a lot because of my exposure to smart<br>
people who were coming from the same direction but who disagreed with<br>
me on particular points.<br>
<p>
There is nothing wrong with "recruitment" and such, but there are<br>
valid functions in the world for both places where one debates ideas<br>
like the extropian world view and for places where one kicks back and<br>
relaxes with one's fellow extropians. This is not to say that the<br>
extropian world view should be a dogmatic fixed set of ideas<br>
unamenable to debate or change, but only that *CONSTANT* debate about<br>
things people already basically have their views set on is tiresome,<br>
and one wants a place to get away from it periodically. An idea set<br>
that is defended from questioning is doomed to become an encrusted<br>
dogma, but one doesn't want to spend every minute of one's entire life<br>
questioning every premise, either.<br>
<p>
Andrea (as she so often does -- thank goodness we have a rational head<br>
or two about) points out that I'm perhaps romanticizing the turbulent<br>
past of the list and that there has ALWAYS been conflict between the<br>
periodic interloper who thought that democratic socialism was the<br>
bee's knees or some such, and that we shouldn't think there ever was a<br>
"golden age". Fair enough. However, whether or not in the past we had<br>
less or more "junk" posted isn't ultimately important -- what is<br>
important is "what do we want". [As an aside, although I remember the<br>
problem being smaller years ago, I must admit that my memory isn't<br>
what it once was -- oh, for a limitless solid state infrastructure<br>
instead of this limited cranium full of squishy neurons!]<br>
