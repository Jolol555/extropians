The name comes from Hugh Everett, best known for the Everett, or many worlds  <br>
interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Everett has been dead for many years now,  <br>
at least in this universe. He was disappointed at the poor reception his <br>
theory received and lost interest in Quantum Mechanics, he spent most of his <br>
life writing nuclear war games for The Pentagon. In his youth Everett was <br>
interested in the philosophical aspects of Quantum Mechanics and in the last <br>
few years his theory has increased in popularity. <br>
<p>
Quantum Mechanics has been more successful, over a wider range of conditions <br>
than any theory I know of, but it has always suffered from philosophical <br>
problems. Is that a wave or a particle?  In what direction is that photon <br>
polarized? The standard Copenhagen  interpretation, believed by most <br>
Physicists, is that nothing is anything  until a measurement is made and the <br>
wave function collapses.  If you decide to use a photographic plate, an <br>
electron is a particle.  If you decide to use an interferometer, an electron <br>
is a wave.  This works fine except its a bit vague about what a measurement <br>
is  and who is taking the measurement. Are Human Beings the only ones able  <br>
to make an observation and change a potential reality into a actual one? <br>
What about a chimp, or a dog, or a bug?                <br>
<p>
In 1957 Hugh Everett solved the measurement problem but at a very high price, <br>
too high most thought. He said that when any particle undergoes the smallest <br>
detectable change ( a quantum jump ) the entire universe, including you the <br>
observer, duplicates itself and splits in two, but we have (almost) no way<br>
of communicating with the other universe. If true this would mean there is an <br>
infinite number (some say just an astronomical number) of universes. <br>
<p>
Many universes would differ from this one in only one tiny detail, but some <br>
would be very different. Even EXTREMELY unlikely events would happen in one <br>
of them. In one I was just elected The Pope, in another I graduated from <br>
Ringling Brothers Clown Collage, and in yet another one all the molecules of <br>
air diffused by chance to the  other side of the room as I type this and I <br>
suffocate.<br>
 <br>
Today David Deutsch is probably the leading advocate of Everett's ideas. In <br>
response to critics who say the theory is untestable he maintains that an  <br>
intelligent  quantum computer could detect these worlds, if they are there. <br>
 <br>
A conscious quantum computer shoots electrons at a metal plate that has  <br>
2 small slits in it. It does this one at a time. After leaving the plate the  <br>
electrons hit some photographic film, but do not look at the photograph until  <br>
later.  The quantum mind has detectors near each slit so it knows which slit <br>
the various electrons went through. The quantum mind now signs a document<br>
saying that it has observed  each and every electron and knows what slit each <br>
electron went through.  It is very important that the document does NOT say <br>
which slit the electron  went through, it only says that they went through <br>
one slit only, and the mind has knowledge of which one. Now the mind uses <br>
quantum erasure to completely destroy his memory of the experiment. The only <br>
part remaining is the document.  Now look at the photographic plate. If you <br>
see interference bands then the  many world interpretation is correct. If you <br>
do not see interference bands then there are no worlds but this one and the <br>
conventional interpretation is correct.  In the Copenhagen interpretation<br>
when the results of a measurement enters the  consciousness of an observer <br>
the wave function collapses, in effect all the universes except one disappear, <br>
so you get no interference. In the many  worlds model all the other worlds <br>
still exist in parallel and will converge and interfere with each other when<br>
the electrons hit the photographic film.<br>
 <br>
Deutsch thinks an experiment like this will actually be performed in the <br>
first half of the next century. The reason it is so difficult is that the  <br>
conventional view says that conscious observers obey different laws of  <br>
physics, many worlds says they do not. To test who is right we need a mind  <br>
that uses quantum properties. <br>
 <br>
It will not be easy to erase memories completely with nothing leaking out to  <br>
the rest of the universe, but recent developments suggest that it may be  <br>
possible. This sort of quantum isolation would not just be needed to test  <br>
many worlds, it would be essential if you want to make a quantum computer .<br>
