Having &lt;nothing better to do&gt;...a little while ago...I cruised the Web<br>
extensively... (I loooooooove the net....just THINK of a question...and you<br>
can FIND OUT!!!...If Id'a had this as a KID!!)  with hydrogen on my mind.<br>
<p>
And lo and behold...<br>
<p>
there are a dozen or so companies working on Fuel Cells which do or could run<br>
off hydrogen...producing electricity and distilled water as the only<br>
byproduct.<br>
<p>
There is an Ocean Thermal Energy Converter alive and well at the University<br>
of Hawaii...It's rated at 200KW of which 20KW is left over after<br>
overhead...&lt;Twenty Kilowats of FREE electricity...didn't cost anything for<br>
fuel...didn't cause ANY pollution...didn't deplete ANY natural &lt;what other<br>
kind is there?&gt; resources&gt; They don't say anything (I don't think) about<br>
electroliysis...but what's to stop it?<br>
<p>
There are several dozen modified Buses  currently running off Hydrogen.<br>
<p>
Gas or Diesel engines need only slight modification to run off Hydrogen.<br>
<p>
(But everyone seems to be waiting for Government ASSistance.)<br>
<p>
Here's a possible scenario....(&lt;since I have nothing better to do&gt;...when I'm<br>
not bashing government...I design things...in my head...the rest of me is<br>
busy driving)<br>
<p>
Some bright boy (or girl) designs a Von Neuman OTEC....a seed...this seed<br>
need not be small...In fact I evision something in size  between that of a<br>
semi-tractor trailer rig and small freighter (ship)..factory produced...by<br>
the ???&lt;dozen..hundred??&gt;<br>
<p>
Take the OTEC seed and place it in  deep (the deeper the better) tropical<br>
water relatively close to the equator..there must be a minimium of 36degree<br>
temp differential between the bottom and surface....not rare...LOTS of ocean<br>
fits the bill)<br>
<p>
The OTEC seed  hits bottom  and unfolds (or hangs suspended and<br>
unfolds..details..details).. a tight mess of wires , the "skeleton" of the<br>
pipe reaching from the frigid depths to the sultry surface knits itself into<br>
structural forms (stiff leg sea structures) borrowed from the oil<br>
patch...once assembled the "wire frame" is electrically charged (Solar Panel<br>
array...mini OTEC...diesel generator...&lt;details..details&gt;.<br>
<p>
A property of sea water is that charged wire tends to accumulate depositions<br>
of minerals from the water...sea-ment.   This seament can be extremely<br>
strong...structurally strong. Strong enough (with the wire "re-bar" for the<br>
structure of the OTEC...only the "guts" need be transported to the site. The<br>
rest "grows".<br>
<p>
Eventually a tube condenses from  the bottom to the surface...a low pressure<br>
high volume electrically powered pump (Turbine?)(installed via telepresense<br>
remote?) pushes the frigid water, into the tube, to the {(or near....probably<br>
better to be beneath storm surge depth) [but the equatorial tropics have<br>
mostly vertical air movement...horse latitude..Doldrums...so storms are rare<br>
<i>]&lt;???seems logical????&gt;)} surface. There the rest of the Open Cycle Ocean</i><br>
Thermal Energy Conversion unit is located.  (Vacum Pumps...Steam<br>
Turbines...Electrical Generators...Condensation Units ....government health<br>
inspectors &lt;NOT&gt;)..  for specifics of the technical details dial up OTEC on<br>
your search engine...check out the  Hawaii   research center. <br>
<p>
Three immediate products arise from the OTEC...distilled water (five times<br>
less salt than tap water)...Electricity...and nutrients from the depths<br>
(surface tropical waters are typically nutrient poor)  An infinite<br>
&lt;well...lots and lots and lotss&gt; amount is available.<br>
<p>
Use your imagination as to the disposition of these there primary products..<br>
 I have..my imagination includes the on-site production of Hydrogen..(and<br>
oxygen?).it's liquidification..and transport to sea side pipeline terminal by<br>
a fleet of WIG's (Wing In Ground Effect craft..(I figure water propulsion<br>
would be most fuel effecient..prop or water jet)..{.there's web pages on them<br>
too) fueled by the "boil off" of the liquid Hydrogen...upon arriving at the<br>
pipeline terminal they offload the majority of their load saving enough for<br>
one craft to make the return trip....then queing and connecting to be towed<br>
back to the OTEC for another round....no fuel costs...possibly robot craft<br>
.(except for one crew...or maybe not)<br>
<p>
The offloaded Hydrogen is then transported via natural gas pipeline (after<br>
boiling to ambient temp) &lt;seems like some use of the tempeture differential<br>
could be found..such as electrical generation? to run the pumps...to feed<br>
into the grid?&gt; to points of use. (natural gas has a high Methane<br>
content...which itself has a high Hydrogen content...the addittion of<br>
molecular Hydrogen to the natural gas should cause no problems I would<br>
guess..for the time being..eventually the Hydrogen could be kept pure and<br>
sold and used as is...(thus elimating the creation of COtwo...and hastening<br>
the next Ice Age...which would lower sea levels , bury Alaska under a glacier<br>
and cause Texas to double in size...such a deal!!!)<br>
<p>
Other minor side-effects of the OTECs might be unlimited Lobster<br>
Thermidor...or other "domesticated" species..grown in the Sea Farm made<br>
possible by the nutrients brought to the surface...<br>
<p>
"We Have The Technolgy...We Can Rebuild Him"...<br>
<p>
&lt;ooops sorry...wrong scenario.&gt;<br>
