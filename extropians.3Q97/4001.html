<p>
It's also the western european country where the gov't spends the highest<br>
percentage of the GNP (53% in 1994, US: 23% in 1994), and it's probably the<br>
country with the highest percentage of gov't jobs.<br>
<p>
To understand why the Netherlands can never be the model for any European<br>
country looking to do what the Netherlands have done, you have to know that<br>
Rotterdam is Europes top harbor (282 mln tons in 1991), and one of the<br>
worlds largest. The countries economy depends highly on transport &amp; sales<br>
of imported goods to other european countries.      <br>
<p>
For a country who's economy depends so much on it's neigbours, <br>
the purchasing-power of its own population becomes less of a priority to<br>
its economy, which is why in western Europe only spain, portugal, greece<br>
and ireland have a lower purchasing-power, all countries with a<br>
substantially lower (40% or more) gnp/head of the population. <br>
<p>
So if you take the 3-10% more that the gov't spends of the gnp, add the 10%<br>
more taken away in the planned economy in purchasing-power, and add the<br>
fact that the economy gets extra stimulation anyway because of the<br>
countries position as transit route for most of western europes imports,<br>
you have the explanation why the Netherlands doesn't have to finance its<br>
social excesses through measures that scare away investments, and still be<br>
able compete very well economically with neighbouring countries. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Continental European statesmen are looking</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;towards the Netherlands for guidance on how</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to achieve social security and economic growth</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;at the same time.  Hans Tietmeyer, President of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Bundesbank calls the Netherlands, "the model</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;country, the example of the continent."</i><br>
<p>
Seeing his position, he would have said this more with economic policies<br>
than social policies in mind, as the economic and monetary policies of the<br>
Netherlands are based on the German ones much more than those of other<br>
european countries. As for european monetary &amp; economic integration, the<br>
Netherlands have always been one of the first to adapt to Germany's. Which<br>
isn't so strange regarding the 60%/15% interdependence of the economies.<br>
(old data, don't know what it is today) Rotterdam is Germany's harbor more<br>
than it is the Dutch...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;The Dutch model, however, simply doesn't work.</i><br>
<p>
It does, but at a cost most Dutch people do not realize.<br>
The point is that the Netherlands are in a unique situation because of its<br>
strategic geographical position in Europe, any country hoping to model<br>
after the Dutch social-economical example will need a comparable<br>
stimulating economical factor.<br>
(i don't think there's a single European country with one that compares)     <br>
<p>
The Dutch simply do not need to reform, unless its neighbours do, and still<br>
maintain the average standard of living level, while being able to keep up<br>
one of the highest levels of social security in Europe. <br>
<p>
Ofcourse if they instead maintained an average social security level, their<br>
standard of living might rise to being the highest in Europe. <br>
<p>
Just my observation. <br>
