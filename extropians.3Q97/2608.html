&lt; This takes my thread back to where it derives from, Paul M.<br>
Churchland's work (and not just his) on "folk psychology" and the<br>
possibility (eliminative materialism) that hardly any of the words<br>
that we currently use to describe psychological phenomena have any<br>
actual referents.  Psychological phenomena might easily be concrete,<br>
real, physical, computational phenomena *without* having any kind of<br>
one-to-one correspondence with any of the words we currently use to<br>
talk about psychological phenomena.&gt;<br>
<p>
I recently read a review of Churchland’s "Engine of Reason" in PSYCHE<br>
(see <a href="http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/v2/psyche-2-29-dacosta.html">http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/v2/psyche-2-29-dacosta.html</a>) and<br>
started thinking about this again and decided to look up eliminative<br>
materialism.  I found a nice overview of the philosophical categories<br>
in Richard Vitzthum’s "Philosophical Materialism", a lecture given to<br>
the Atheist Students Association at the University of Maryland,<br>
College Park, on November 14, 1996, available at<br>
<a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_vitzthum/materialism.html">http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_vitzthum/materialism.html</a><br>

&lt;When someone today describes himself or herself as a materialist,<br>
they generally mean they stand somewhere in a spectrum defined at one<br>
end as reductive materialism[3] and at the other end as eliminative<br>
materialism[4]. [SNIP] One promising theory is that networks of<br>
neurons in the brain consist of subsidiary groups of neurons or even<br>
individual neurons that serve as the axes of a multi-dimensional<br>
system of coordinates that can mathematically translate one kind of<br>
value to another kind of value. [SNIP] eliminativists hold that the<br>
theory is so revolutionary and so much more convincing than current<br>
theories of the brain -- for instance, that the brain is basically<br>
propositional and language-oriented -- that it will eventually<br>
displace and replace the linguistic theory, just as the modern theory<br>
of mental disease displaced the medieval theory of demonic possession.<br>
Against them stand the reductive materialists, I among them, who share<br>
their enthusiasm for the new theory but believe that it will<br>
successfully reduce at least portions of the old theory the way<br>
Einstein's relativity successfully reduced Newton's laws of motion.&gt;<br>
<p>
&lt;[4] Eliminative materialists contend that minds don't exist, that our<br>
'vague talk' about things like feelings, thoughts, desires, etc, needs<br>
to be eliminated from our vocabulary and replaced with precise<br>
scientific terms referring only to brain states.&gt;<br>
(<a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_vitzthum/materialism.html#F4">http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_vitzthum/materialism.html#F4</a>)<br>
<p>
I couldn’t disagree more! Vitzthum also states that "eliminativists<br>
and reductionists believe only in physical substances and properties".<br>
 Is software *and its usage* simply a "property" of the computer on<br>
which it is running?  I think these accounts are lacking a key<br>
concept, organization, which has been well developed by systems<br>
science and cybernetics (cf. Principia Cybernetica).  In fact, some<br>
connectionists are beginning to wonder whether they have not been<br>
paying enough attention to system architecture (cf. "Connectionist<br>
Learning: Is It Time To Reconsider The Foundations?" 14 May 1997 post<br>
by Asim Roy at <a href="http://neuro.psy.soton.ac.uk/~at/Archive/0026.html">http://neuro.psy.soton.ac.uk/~at/Archive/0026.html</a>)<br>

&lt; [8] Functionalists claim that mental states are functional states<br>
(rather than brain states) which connect input (environmental<br>
stimuli), other mental states (interconnected functions), and output<br>
(behavioral responses) in a cognitive system by means of causal<br>
relations. [Snip] Most functionalists are physicalists [materialists]<br>
in that they hold that only appropriate physical states could serve as<br>
such causal intermediaries. But they... [hold that] mental properties<br>
cannot be identified with physical-biological properties.&gt;<br>
(<a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_vitzthum/materialism.html#F8">http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_vitzthum/materialism.html#F8</a>)<br>
<p>
This sounds much closer to my way of thinking about things, except for<br>
"rather than" in the first sentence - I would say "as well as". The<br>
"identified" is key in the last sentence - few complex systems are<br>
reducible to the *sum* of their parts because some parts are dual<br>
purpose, participating as components in several systems, even serving<br>
several functions simultaneously.<br>
<p>
Another very useful reference was Lyle Zynda’s metaphysics handout,<br>
"Churchland on Eliminative Materialism" for a 1995 Caltech course at<br>
<a href="http://sun1.iusb.edu/~lzynda/handout14.html">http://sun1.iusb.edu/~lzynda/handout14.html</a> :<br>
<p>
&lt; Churchland argues that functionalism is in fact a reactionary theory<br>
that tries to save an outmoded conception of our mental lives (folk<br>
psychology) by abstraction. Folk psychology is made immune to advances<br>
in neuroscience by postulating that its categories (beliefs and<br>
desires) are only "functional states." According to Churchland, this<br>
is a scientifically illegitimate move, as illegitimate as an attempt<br>
to save alchemy in the face of the new chemical theories of Lavoisier<br>
and Dalton by postulating that its categories were merely "functional"<br>
and not really chemical. &gt;<br>
<p>
Well, sure, it’s a "scientifically illegitimate move" *if* your<br>
research is aimed *only* at mechanical description! But, is the<br>
scientific method appropriate for guiding all forms of human activity,<br>
such as poetry or sexuality? When it comes to structural descriptions<br>
and engineering research, eliminativism is probably the appropriate<br>
description, especially with major paradigm shifts. BUT, I would<br>
counter that it’s a *philosophically illegitimate move* to deny any<br>
sort of functional analysis!  I think this is particularly true in the<br>
case of neuroscience (as opposed to chemistry, for example) which is<br>
still in its infancy.<br>
<p>
I’m beginning to feel that this eliminative approach advocated by<br>
Churchland reeks of throwing out the baby with the bath water and<br>
leaves us, for example, wallowing for years in the intricacies of<br>
neural net vector processing when there are important architectural<br>
and relational issues that we should also be addressing.<br>
