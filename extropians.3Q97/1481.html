I completely agree with Hal's comments on secular humanists. They agree on<br>
many extropian values, but their lack of egoism will kill them!<br>
<p>
Clarke knows about cryonics, and has even written a brief for Alcor back<br>
when they were under attack by government agencies. He has no plans to sign<br>
up, and has some objection based on his view of personal identity, i.e., he<br>
thinks there is no point signing up because he will eventually become such<br>
a different person. I find it hard to see this as anything other than a<br>
rationalization for some fear he has.<br>
<p>
Maybe one day a bunch of extropians will be able to corner him in a room<br>
and probe at his philosophical views and perhaps persuade him to change<br>
them to something less lethal.<br>
