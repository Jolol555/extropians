                      <br>
<p>
Yes, and if you look up "reality" you will find "something that exists" or <br>
its equivalent, and looking up "being" will tell you it possesses the quality  <br>
of reality. I have never found that a dictionary to be very enlightening <br>
philosophically, probably because lexicographers are not great philosophers <br>
but also because they get the knowledge to write their book from common usage, <br>
and that not much use in philosophy where it's customary to push concepts to <br>
extremes to see where they'll break.  <br>
<p>
By itself a dictionary is nothing but one big circular definition.    <br>
All the definitions in a dictionary are made of words, and those words also <br>
have definitions made of other words also in the dictionary, and round and <br>
round we go. The way out of this paradox is the fact that much, perhaps most,<br>
of our knowledge in not in the dictionary because it's not made of words.<br>

<i>     &gt;You're redirecting the discussion into the limits of our epistemology.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>     &gt;nonetheless, there is a universe out there, independent of us.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Interesting theory.<br>

<i>      &gt;If all humans died tomorrow the bacteria and the Virgo cluster         </i><br>
<i>      &gt;would still be there, and the chair would last quite a while.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
And exactly what is it that the Virgo cluster has that the Mandelbrot Set <br>
lacks?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>       &gt;The sense impressions of the real things you mentioned were        </i><br>
<i>       &gt;formed from the actual things. The Mandelbrot set sense impressions        </i><br>
<i>       &gt;were formed from a finite approximation to the Mandelbrot set.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
You're saying that The Mandelbrot set does not exist because it's too complex, <br>
only simple cartoon like things can be real. Well OK, but then who needs to <br>
be "real"?  It would seem that possessing the quality of "reality" is not <br>
desirable.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>       &gt;as you pointed out, finite representations of the Mandelbrot set        </i><br>
<i>       &gt;are *very* different from the actual Mandelbrot set.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
We can know something about the Mandelbrot set, we just can't know everything. <br>
How is that different from a chair?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>       &gt;I can make a program that creates the sense impressions I'd get from        </i><br>
