&lt;&lt; The idea is that if<br>
 you have multiple people deliberate, argue and debate about the right<br>
 thing to do, you are more likely to get a reasonable answer. &gt;&gt;<br>

One of those good ideas that never seems to work in reality.  What is it they<br>

<p>
It seems that a group is constrained by it's lowest common denominator.  I<br>
read of a study years ago that indicated that the overall intelligence of a<br>
group decreased as the group size increased.<br>
