In a message dated 97-08-31 02:09:31 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; The toadies you refer to would include the entire crew of some<br>
 Naval vessel.<br>
<p>
Actually I thinking of the FBI and the news media..but you have a point.<br>
<p>
 As I recall, you were an Air Force crypto tech. Would<br>
 you and your buddies in the Air Force have agreed to keep a secret<br>
 equivalent to a shoot-down of this flight? I know my buddies at<br>
 the Army communications center (I was an E5, MOS was 72F) would not.<br>
 Why do you think the crew of that ship would keep quiet? These<br>
 young sailors are fundamentally the same type of guys as you and I<br>
 were at that age. (Well, OK, I admit that sailors are different, but<br>
 not that way.) &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
In my career field secrecy was a major concern...we were told not to tell<br>
ANYONE.....ANYTHING..... about ANYTHING.... actually it even caused some<br>
psychological problems with some of the younge more trusting guys.<br>
<p>
And yeah...I do think that it could be covered up given the scenario I<br>
sketched...particularly if the missel was sub-launched. Very few onboard the<br>
launch vehicle would know what or if the missel hit...it was supposedly an<br>
over-the-horizon shot..<br>
<p>
The senior NCO's and the Orificers would be most likely to toe the<br>
party-line...they've been trained in obedience for much longer...and have<br>
more to loose.  (from my experience in the VietNam. debauchle....I could tell<br>
you a few stories about THAT..)..and the "sea stories"...(called War Stories<br>
in the AF)..would be irrelevant....there are always War Stories...it's a<br>
major form of entertainment.<br>
<p>
Sad to say...I think I'm still leaning toward the missel theory...wish I<br>
wasn't.<br>
