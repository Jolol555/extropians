Exactly. What I was thinking of was some kind of system that could<br>
keep truth (or empirical facts) safe, available and uncorrupted. Of<br>
course, this is not just a matter of piling up the information in<br>
the vault of a trusted group, we need something more flexible and<br>
able to withstand info attacks and the need to change some information<br>
as new evidence accumulates. Perhaps some kind of constitution-like<br>
system of rules guaranteeing slow and carefully inspected change<br>
combined with a distributed network and strong cryptographic verification.<br>

<i>&gt;    I can see VR providing a defense from disinformation campaigns, in that</i><br>
<i>&gt; they could be used by a responsible organizatrion to remove the filter</i><br>
<i>&gt; entirely.  In an entirely immersive environment, people could see events</i><br>
<i>&gt; and processes without editing or commentary, see everything there is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; see on the process and thus make their own decisions.</i><br>
<p>
I can imagine John laughing so that he falls on the floor reading that - <br>
as he said to me: "Thats *exactly* what we would like you to think!". <br>
The problem is that the more VR and internet we use, the more we use <br>
second-hand information that can be tampered with. Do you really trust <br>
your filters? Do you really think you see things directly over the net? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The interactivety</i><br>
<i>&gt; is even more important, as somebody could keep accessing information on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; subject until they were satisfied that they knew what was going on.</i><br>
<p>
Very true. This is the one strength of the net - you can get several<br>
independent files and check that they say the same. The problem is that<br>
most people don't do that. <br>
