<p>
A retreat to space is the most likely method of negating the sea's strategic<br>
advantages, leaving the local tactical advantages of home ground.  Even if the<br>
goo can fling unlimited missiles after you, they'll be defeated, and their<br>
material consumed, only adding to your size.  Even so, spacegoers might be<br>
vulnerable to being surrounded, or having their light cut off.  But any city<br>
on a planet is untenable, since the planet might turn into a sea.  If you have<br>
all the material you're using, leave for space while you still can.<br>
<p>
So then we have the following scenario:<br>
<p>
1.  Drexler (for example) gets nanotech in some hidden laboratory.<br>
<p>
2.  (Dictator phase.  These actions are taken without debate.)<br>
  A.  Drexler disables all nuclear weapons.<br>
  B.  If there is any obvious and safe way to do so, human bodies are<br>
strengthened to survive the coming disruption.<br>
  C.  Drexler builds a fortress for himself and hides within.<br>
  D.  Drexler announces nanotech.<br>
<p>
3.  (Monopoly phase.  Debate, but only Drexler has nanotech.)<br>
	Drexler directs the nanotech to take each city, build it a Colony, and fling<br>
it into space.  He might also give some mechanism whereby an individual can<br>
request his own Colony; I'd want one.<br>
	Drexler also directs the nanotech to build a transit system between Colonies;<br>
and to build some huge number of spare Colonies so individuals or fringe<br>
groups can have them.<br>
	He doesn't have to disturb the surface of the Earth (except for all the<br>
missing cities); he can use the sea floor for raw material, and even bring up<br>
a lot of extra sea floor in case we need more.  Maybe even the asteroids would<br>
suffice; would there be enough of each element?<br>
	Sweeping the Earth for farmers would be harder and more arbitrary, but it<br>
could still be done.<br>
	At the end of phase three, Earth is depopulated.  All inhabitants are<br>
compartmentalized in space, either in Earth orbit or spread through Earth's<br>
orbit.  Note that this whole phase has to take place in minimum time, and that<br>
Drexler has to do it all himself.  (This suggests, in practical terms, that<br>
nanotech centers should have complete plans for Colonies always on hand.  And<br>
we might start looking for popular consent... bearing in mind that there'll be<br>
a lot of "I *like* Earth" whining until actual nanotech is demonstrated.  But<br>
it needn't come as a shock.)<br>
  Even so, can one person do all the nano-design work involved?  I don't know.<br>
 I should think we'd need high-level crystalizable designs, the physical<br>
equivalent of pseudo-code.  Can we do that?  Right now?  What would be needed<br>
to do that right now, in terms of cash and computer power?<br>
  Since the whole point of this is to avoid spreading contamination, and to<br>
avoid the goo gaining an overwhelming material superiority, the Colonies<br>
should really orbit the Sun, be at least 10,000,000 miles from Earth or any<br>
other planet, and be at least 100,000 miles from each other.<br>
<p>
4.  (Nanotech phase.)<br>
	Drexler makes nanotech freely available and abdicates.  The goo cannot become<br>
a sea due to lack of available material; it must spread by spores and<br>
therefore immunity is workable.  It might be necessary to implement primitive<br>
'mune in the colonies before GNUing nanotech.  All such systems will<br>
necessarily be primitive, however, because they will be implemented only by<br>
one person and designed only by whatever pre-nano team does the pseudocode.<br>
<p>
In this situation, I'd go off alone, above the ecliptic, and far away from<br>
everyone else, maybe snagging an asteroid along the way to use for raw<br>
material.  I'd remain in communication, using what 'tech became available and<br>
offering my own suggestions.  But mainly, I'd be experimenting with neural reprogramming.<br>
<p>
I don't know how the rest of the populace would take it.  I don't know how the<br>
Extropians would take it.  I don't know whether warfare could be devastatingly<br>
prosecuted on that scale, with nukes and lasers disrupting the fragility of<br>
space.  I don't know what kind of mutual defense treaties would be organized. <br>
I don't know what countries would survive.  I don't know what life will be<br>
like.  I don't know what the Singularity ETA would be.<br>
<p>
But...<br>
<p>
We'd have nanotech.  And, if not safe, at least we wouldn't be doomed.  This,<br>
I think, is more or less the minimum change in rules for nano 'mune to work.<br>
<p>
-- Disadvantages.<br>
<p>
1:  What if there's an enormous advantage for offense over defense in space -<br>
not in nano 'mune, but in ordinary warfare?  What if one Colony can, in a<br>
first strike, wipe out a thousand others?  Will we be safe from the goo, only<br>
to be devoured by each other?<br>
<p>
2:  I can't help but think that at least some dictatorial powers are going to<br>
be needed to evacuate the Earth.<br>
<p>
3:  How many Colonies will succumb to gray goo within themselves, from foolish<br>
experiments?  What percentage will survive?  What percentage will be left?<br>
<p>
4:  How does Drexler, all by himself, do all this?  What's the minimum size of<br>
the Nano King's Court?<br>
