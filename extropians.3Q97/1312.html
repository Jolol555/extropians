<i>&gt;There is a recent history of viewing physical frontiers as promoting virtue</i><br>

<i>&gt;colonialism or later global "running-dog" capitalist. John Ruskin in 1878</i><br>

God said 'exterminate them Injuns', and it was good.<br>
I think these kind of doctrines are an afterthought, or gilding over of <br>
primal imperative.<br>
One nice feature of the rest of the Solar System is the low occupancy rate,<br>
as I find it necessary to point out to my Cherokee friend, who thinks we should<br>
clean house here on Earth first.<br>

Frederick Turner's essay "The Significance of the Frontier in<br>
<i>&gt;American History" (1893) argued that.., opportunities for</i><br>
<i>&gt;growth and self-renewal would be shut off, leading to decadence.  Turner</i><br>
<i>&gt;held that the frontier experience was central to America's character, "the</i><br>
<i>&gt;meeting point between savagery and civilization."  In other words, an</i><br>
<i>&gt;extropic arena of vitality.</i><br>

Well, this is what I get for replying to email in reverse order. This sounds <br>
like the essay I am looking for, and may still be a very relavent document in <br>
Extrpoic theory.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Frontiers are not "goals," a frequent misapplication of the term, they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;boundaries.  They are really physical, meaning spatial, or rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;territorial.  Any use of the word "frontier" outside of this meaning is</i><br>
<i>&gt;only metaphorical.</i><br>
<p>
Just so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We are too hemmed in here.  We</i><br>
<i>&gt;are like restless ants, and our restlessness is ratcheting up.  Space is</i><br>
<i>&gt;only real physical frontier to escape the </i><br>
<p>
(insert capitalized neologism of your choice).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Absent a frontier, absent space to dream in, and move in, humanity implodes</i><br>
<i>&gt;into a stagant dogmatic sinkhole.</i><br>
<p>
cf "present day"<br>
<p>
 This bears repeating:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  From the experience of the Crusades ..[[etc]] it has been *Space* (or Extension)</i><br>
<i>&gt;, that was placed</i><br>
<i>&gt;at the pinnacle of spirituality.  Our true longing, to expand and grow,..., </i><br>
is to leave earth physically and explore outer space.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Short of being able to do this, we are reaching out to create and then tame</i><br>
<i>&gt;the wilderness of cyberspace.  Cyberspace, after all the media hype is</i><br>
<i>&gt;boiled down, is simply a temporary stopover, a holding pattern, until our</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology advances further into real space... </i><br>
