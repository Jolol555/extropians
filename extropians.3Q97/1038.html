In a message dated 97-07-21 12:03:30 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; before the caldera occurred. The Minoan's apparently fled to<br>
 another stronghold, the island of Crete, where they were virtually<br>
 wiped out by the tidal wave following the massive explosion.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Actually I beleive the story is somewhat different....I spent four years on<br>
the Island of crete in the late seventies...unfortunately I never got to go<br>
see Thera...it is a big tourist attraction.<br>
<p>
My understanding (I may be mistaken) was that Thera and Crete were<br>
contemperanious...Crete being the homeland.  Thera the colony....there are<br>
extensive ruins of the Minoan civilization still extant on Crete...the Palace<br>
of Minos comes to mind...when the Volcano on Thera went Ka-Blooey it made a<br>
BIG ripple...enough to scrub away most of that day's civilization....I<br>
beleive Homer (?)..(the guy who wrote about Atlantis)...was referring to<br>
something in the past ...folklore handed down...before the disaster...<br>
<p>
My understanding....based upon what I picked up while there....was that Crete<br>
was the EARLIEST civilization....Assyria..Babylon...Egypt...Greece....all<br>
came later....<br>
<p>
Of course...I may be wrong....I was more interested in other things than<br>
history while I was there....but that is my recollection from the museum I<br>
toured while there.<br>
