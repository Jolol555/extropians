<i>&gt; I tend to lean towards a holistic neuron arrangement explaination. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; the arrangment of neurons in your brain defines your identity, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; only because each and every neuron is in a particular place, which, as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; consequence, births something more than the sum of the physical</i><br>
<i>&gt; components (a particular identity). That is, a squishy mess of neurons</i><br>
<i>&gt; put together based upon an incomplete picture of the *entire*</i><br>
<i>&gt; arrangement would not yield anything more than a squishy mess of</i><br>
<i>&gt; neurons. </i><br>
<p>
Holism can work the other way too: an almost correctly put together<br>
brain would self-organize to a state very similar to the original<br>
person as memories, personality, chemical gradients etc relaxed<br>
towards a consistent state. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Reductionist study of the brain may be helpful to understand</i><br>
<i>&gt; biology, but I would hazard that it is insufficient to understand</i><br>
<i>&gt; something so complex (and unfortunately, abstract) as identity. </i><br>
<p>
It is funny to notice that the idea of holism is in some sense<br>
deeply conservative. It claims that we can (and must) understand<br>
the whole system without looking at the parts, and that attempts<br>
to do so anyway will fail. The odd thing is that top-down explanations<br>
(which are holistic) so far has not been very successful in helping <br>
us understand the mind, the body and the universe despite centuries<br>
of thinking, while bottom-up explanations of reductionism have worked <br>
quite nicely even if they are limited. <br>
<p>
Personally I see no problem with having complex and abstract<br>
properties emerging from low-level systems, they do it all the<br>
time. As I think it was Carl Sagan said: "there is no such<br>
thing as *mere* matter"!. The simplest systems demonstrate<br>
complex behaviors based on simple internal interactions; we<br>
can choose on what level we want to study them, but it is often<br>
easier to deal with the lower levels first and then deduce <br>
how they interact to produce higher levels. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is not to say that our understanding of the brain will never reach</i><br>
<i>&gt; the point where we can "fudge" things a little. But, one neuron</i><br>
<i>&gt; incorrectly arranged may have little effect on identity -- say one step</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the identity continuum. Two neurons incorrectly arranged -- two</i><br>
<i>&gt; steps. Would three neurons incorrectly arranged have only a three-step</i><br>
<i>&gt; effect? Or would it be four steps? Or six? What about four neurons? An</i><br>
<i>&gt; exponential, geometric or one-to-one effect on identity?</i><br>
<p>
That depends on how you measure geometry, what local metric you use<br>
in identity-space (see Sasha's excellent paper about it, on his website).<br>
My guess is that the effect will depend a lot on which neurons are<br>
erroneous, some are more important than the others. My experience<br>
from neural networks suggests that they tend to be fairly stable as<br>
you disrupt them until a certain point, and then they quickly break<br>
down. So the identity left after a certain number of fudges<br>
would look like this:<br>
<p>
---------                 100% identity<br>
         \<br>
<i>          |</i><br>
<i>          |</i><br>
<i>          |</i><br>
<i>          |</i><br>
<i>          |</i><br>
           \<br>
            ------------  Zero identity<br>
---Neural Change--------&gt;<br>
<p>
This suggests that small errors are completely insignificant. <br>
The big question is where the breakdown happens; we know far too<br>
little to be able to say for certain. A guess is that it corresponds<br>
to a fraction of the total cell number, and given what we know about<br>
dementia, I would guess that you could probably have around 0.1-1%<br>
neural change and still be safely yourself (with a possible <br>
performance decrement). <br>
