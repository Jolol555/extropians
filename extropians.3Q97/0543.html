Well, I cranked up my copy of the freeware Home Planet program<br>
(written by the estimable John Walker) and set the Wayback machine<br>
for 2000 - May 01, then let it walk forward.<br>
<p>
It looks like all the planets do wind up on the same side of the<br>
Sun, *not counting the Earth*--but from an astrological perspective <br>
I guess the Earth isn't a planet... Or that all the planets except Mars, <br>
but _counting_ the Earth, wind up on the same side, depending on exactly<br>
what day in May you look at.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From Damien Broderick:</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is way off topic, but it's a meme-jungle out there.  An ep of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Chris Carter series `Millennium' was shown here in Oz the other night, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;which the Grand Key to It All (maybe) is revealed as an impending planetary</i><br>
<i>&gt;line-up </i><br>
<p>
Hardly a line-up. At least by my orrery, all you get is a scatter of planets <br>
that all fall on one side of an imaginary line bisecting the Solar System.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;of seven planets, all neatly on the same side of the sun as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;earth, in May 2000.  Not having a digital orrey to hand, I wonder if anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;who does have access to such a program could confirm or deny this detail?</i><br>
<p>
Well, *AS SEEN FROM EARTH* they would make a line; but this is<br>
just because they're pretty much more or less on the plane of the Ecliptic<br>
(I'm not sure what's up with Pluto, and I'm not fascinated enough<br>
to go fire up Home Planet again and go see about it). Not counting Pluto, <br>
that would be seven planets in a line, visible at night, all right. <br>
A pretty long line, though.<br>
<p>
Methinks they "sweetened this up" for an impressive _2001_-style lineup<br>
visual. Did they?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I find it hard to believe, and assume the scriptwriters just kinda...</i><br>
<i>&gt;rearranged the solar system, to make the story work.</i><br>
<p>
See above. I welcome anyone else to confirm. It may very well be rare.<br>
