&lt; 2. The human body has its sensons and actuators ( arms, eyes,<br>
etc...). Why do they need necessarily to be tied to the body and why<br>
do they need to be concentrated in just one part. They could be just<br>
multipartitioned in various nano sensors/actuators... Just<br>
management.... ( about the "esthetic" caracteristics, including our<br>
"good" sensations they can be gotten "virtually" (as  already are its<br>
interpretations...) inside the main processor (possibly parallel), and<br>
via dynamical (and possibly virtual too...) interactions of the<br>
"subparts"...) Indeed, that's a possibilty of getting new great<br>
sensations... for example, on getting sense of different places at the<br>
same time... &gt;<br>

You might like to read the section on "Assimilation and Functional<br>
Integration" in ch.4 of Max More’s "Diachronic Self" thesis available<br>
at <a href="http://www.primenet.com/~maxmore/chapter4.htm">http://www.primenet.com/~maxmore/chapter4.htm</a> from which I quote:<br>
<p>
"When a person undergoes changes, it is internal processes that count<br>
in assimilation, not external functions and purposes.  [SNIP]<br>
Functional integration, it turns out, seems to require something like<br>
exclusive, or at least interference-free, access to a part of the<br>
self. It does not require physical connection, conscious or direct<br>
control, nor sensory awareness of the part. [SNIP] The kind of<br>
interdependence involved in functional integration, whatever the<br>
physiological details, entails mutual support, feedback, homeostasis,<br>
and adaptation."<br>
