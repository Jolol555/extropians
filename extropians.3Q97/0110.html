I was referring to reprogramming those people currently deemed "incorigable"<br>
or "beyond help", like chain murderers, the mentally ill, etc.  I didn't mean<br>
that anyone would have a carte blanche to reprogram anyone who doesn't think<br>
in any particular way.  What would you prefer to offer someone, jail,<br>
execution, or just reprogramming of the violent / stupid / whatever part of<br>
their brain?  Personally, I think a violent person would thank you after the<br>
reprogramming because they'd realize how much better life is when they aren't<br>
so violent, and they didn't even need to become a vegetable as would occur in<br>
a labotomy.  :-)  Shawn<br>
