A year or two ago a gene was found in the roundworm C.elegans that if mutated <br>
allowed the worm to live 8 times its normal life span. This is not quite as  <br>
exciting as it seems because the mutation also slowed down everything in the <br>
animal about 8 times. In today's issue of the journal Science Dr. Gary Ruvkum<br>
found that if he made a change in another gene, called daf-2, the worm lived <br>
3 times as long BUT without slowing the animal down and putting it into a  <br>
general torpor.<br>
<p>
Ruvkum also found the daf-2 gene in humans and 35% of it is identical to the <br>
one in worms. In humans daf-2 codes for a protein in the outer wall of cells  <br>
that is the receptor for insulin. Insulin is just information, it tells cells <br>
how much glucose to metabolize. The products of this metabolism are free<br>
radicals and other nasty things thought by many to be responsible for aging <br>
and the reason that animals on a very reduced diet live longer.<br>
 <br>
People with non-insulin dependent diabetes also have a mutation in their <br>
daf-2 gene, although it's not know if it's the same one Ruvkum produced, <br>
these people can make insulin but can't use it efficiently, they don't live <br>
longer and that's puzzling. Maybe the extra glucose in the blood is more <br>
detrimental than other effects are helpful or maybe another mutation or <br>
another gene is involved, but I think it's hopeful and I'm not the only one.<br>
<p>
Longevity expert Dr. Caleb E Finch of The University of Southern California <br>
says "I think it's  a gorgeous piece of work[...] the bottom line is that <br>
there may be fundamental mechanisms that prevail among all multicellular <br>
organisms and that may be very informative in managing human  aging. [...] <br>
as we learn more about the specific behavior of genes that predispose to <br>
health problems we will be able to modify many aspects of aging".<br>
