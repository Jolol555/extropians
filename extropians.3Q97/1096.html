I've heard that theory.  The problem is that the moon is about 4by old, while<br>
Pangaea appears and disappears on about a 600 my cycle.  The continents move<br>
out (ring of fire) but then they move back (ring of blah?).  They've cycled<br>
about 6 time since the moon formed.  Also, the current theory of moon<br>
formation is that a *big* rock smacked the earth and knocked the entire crust<br>
into orbit, in little bits.  Most of it stayed up there to form the moon.<br>
 But as a result, there's no particular place the moon's material came from.<br>
<p>
But I've also heard a another theory.  Continents, especially large ones,<br>
thin the rock over which they sit, making it easier for magma to pop up,<br>
creating new rifts.  Once formed, the rift creates an ocean.  However, once<br>
the continent is gone, rifts are more likely to close and eventually do, and<br>
the continents drift back together.  So you get a cycle: Pangaea - Pangaea<br>
rifts apart - Atlantic/Pacific/multiple continents - Atlantic rifts close -<br>
New Pangaea.<br>
<p>
Supposedly the Atlantic closes rather than the Pacific because it's always<br>
smaller.<br>
