You're confusing positive and negative rights... &gt;:-}  'Power to do' and <br>

Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau's father (John G. Schmitz) opposed sex <br>
education in schools too, as it happens.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I mean, what did she *think* would happen?</i><br>
<p>
Her husband Steve agreed to bring the kid up as part of their family. He'd <br>
had a vasectomy, I'm told.  His parents didn't like the isea of a <br>
'mixed-race' (Samoan/American) child in the family, and she was confronted <br>
with an 'abortion-or-prosecution' alternative.  She rejected abortion: she <br>
loves her baby.<br>
<p>
Sooo... Steve's parents jump the gun and go to the _Child Protection Unit_ <br>
in Seattle (Wonder on whose advice?) and destroy her life and her family, <br>
so that Steve and they will (they think) get custody, care and control of <br>
the kids.<br>
<p>
<p>
Just guess who's waiting for them in the so-called 'Child Protection Office'?<br>

Well, I was baptized into the Anglican (Episcopalian to you!) Church.  Me <br>
and Cordwainer Smith too (Dr. Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger) -- see his <br>
incomparable short story, "The Game of Rat and Dragon" (GALAXY, [1955)).<br>

I was never Confirmed in the Anglican faith, because I could not give my <br>
rational assent to the Nicene Creed of 325 C.E.  Isaac Newton, many of <br>
whose views I share, believed in the doctrines of Arius, declared <br>
heretical by the Council of Nicea.  Newton also believed that the Western <br>
Empire ('LATHEINOZ') in Greek) was the work of the Devil, BTW.<br>
<p>
<p>
More interestingly, Newton believed space to be the sensorium of God.  The <br>
sensorium is the space within which we imagine and visualize.  God <br>
imagines matter and forces in space and across time, not just pictures or <br>
images.  A Universe 'infinite in all directions' (anything else would be a <br>
limitation on unlimited powers - a view shared by Cardinal Nicholas of <br>
Cusa, who advanced precisely this view in @[1440], including the view that <br>
there were other inhabited planets circling other stars...<br>

<i>&gt; Men and women have normal penetrative sex whilst specifically preventing</i><br>
<i>&gt; reproduction, and I don't think that changes the nature of their</i><br>
<i>&gt; attraction in the slightest; it continues to find a basis in a mutual</i><br>
<i>&gt; desire for sex: that is, it remains sexual.</i><br>
<p>
To me, 'sexual' means 'making babies.'  This activity subsumes many, many <br>
others, of course.<br>
