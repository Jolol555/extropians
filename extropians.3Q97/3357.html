No, the reason this hasn't happened is because of barriers to<br>
trade and migration imposed by national governments.  If each<br>
person on the planet had an global market for their stuff, and<br>
if laborers were allowed to travel to and work in the most<br>
lucrative markets without first securing permits and passes,<br>
then we'd see a very drastic increase in the global standard of<br>
living.<br>
<p>
Of course, some of the comfortable people living in the more<br>
lucrative markets would be disturbed by having to compete with poor<br>
and hungry people on the labor market, which is why such laws exist.<br>
This is the answer to your question: the greed and indifference of<br>
the comfortable and laws designed to protect their cushy lifestyle<br>
from the poorer parts of the world. Tear 'em down, say I.<br>
