     Eliezer observes:<br>
     <br>
     How would thoughtsharing of various types affect sexual mores?  Define <br>
     an Augmented human as a "primary" human supported by several other <br>
     experts sharing the world through virtual reality and communicating <br>
     continuously, waking and sleeping, on subvocal/subconscious/hypnotic <br>
     channels.  <br>
     <br>
     I respond:<br>
     <br>
     I can only respond to this on the very surface as it triggered <br>
     something I have been meaning to point out.  Sentimental and fanciful <br>
     puss that I am, I have seen "Contact" three times.  After an initial <br>
     viewing of a movie I like that much, I start analyzing content and <br>
     looking at the not-so-obvious stuff.  <br>
     <br>
     BLOWING PART OF THE MOVIE WARNING!<br>
     <br>
     One thing I noticed in my return visit is Ellie's meeting with the <br>
     entity (on the beach) that manifested as her father. Even after she <br>
     had deduced her thoughts/memories had been "downloaded", and the <br>
     entity congratulated her on her observation, he still *behaved* as if <br>
     he were her father commenting that she had her mother's hands.  In <br>
     that moment, it occurred to me that Ellie and the entity had shared <br>
     the most intimate of contacts possible to two conscious creatures.  <br>
     Blows the lid of what we try to achieve in our most intimate sexual <br>
     moments (unless, of course, one's sexual experiences are pursued for <br>
     the sake of dominance and power attainment).<br>
     <br>
     I'd like to have extended discussions on the waking and sleeping part. <br>
     There's something in me that likes the (what I presume to be) private <br>
     nature of sleep and dreams.  And I'm not really a private person!<br>
     <br>
