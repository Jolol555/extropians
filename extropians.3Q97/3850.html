     The biggest problem I'm having with [a screenplay on modern <br>
     witchhunts] is trying to avoid the temptation to have a "there was <br>
     witchcraft after all" ending, the potential special effects could be <br>
     great, but it would spoil the message.<br>

     Are you sure it would spoin the message?  I could see how it could <br>
     actually embellish it if it were treated without fear and done with <br>
     respect to actual wiccan/pagan/celtic beliefs.<br>
