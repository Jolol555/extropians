<i>&gt; ...Is it time for an Exline?  I think this would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; a "peer-reviewed" online journal of articles, research, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; debate on futurist topics.  The part most useful to me is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; in order to be eligible for inclusion in such a journal, writers</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be required to supply abstracts for their material that</i><br>
<i>&gt; could be searched and read by busy individuals such as myself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What I haven't figured out is why someone would run such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing, and why people would consent to review writings -- how</i><br>
<i>&gt; would they get paid?  Presumably if the reviewers are of high</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough reputation, writers will do the abstracts just so they</i><br>
<i>&gt; can submit the papers for review (hm -- this might also result</i><br>
<i>&gt; in some more well-thought-out writings).  Somehow it seems that</i><br>
<i>&gt; subscriptions wouldn't work, because there's so much information</i><br>
<i>&gt; available for free.  Maybe a time-delay subscription, where</i><br>
<i>&gt; people who pay get more articles?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Darn it, what would *you* pay for?</i><br>
<p>
There are three services here: content, abstracts, commentary.<br>
Any business model not based on the "content is free" model is<br>
doomed to failure, so you have to get paid for the ongoing service<br>
of providing abstracts and commentary.  The writers are paid a<br>
one-time fee for the content, plus a commission on future sales<br>
of commentary on their article.  Articles are put into a search<br>
engine that users browse.  It brings up the title and one-line<br>
description of each article that hits the search, and has links<br>
to (a) the full content, for free, (b) brief abstracts/summaries<br>
written by the journal's editors or other writers, each of which<br>
has eir own point of view/style, and (c) recently-written<br>
commentary on the article by the journal editors or other writers.<br>
(b) and (c) are constantly updated, and are charged for, but the<br>
customer is buying their novelty, their trust in a writer, their<br>
ability to explain complex work, etc.;  They're not buying content<br>
by itself, they're buying the service of making the content easier<br>
to find, organize, and understand.<br>
<p>
Another thing you can sell is access/interaction: for $5, ask the<br>
writer a question to which you are promised either a useful<br>
response or your $5 back.  Of course, each question and its<br>
answer becomes a new commentary product for you to sell.<br>
<p>
It is important that the full-blown content be there--you can't<br>
/only/ sell commentary.  It might work, but if the service works,<br>
your custmers will become more expert in the fields they research<br>
(that's what they're paying you for), and will want the gory<br>
details of everything, and will probably change their searching<br>
habits (perhaps they begin by reading reviews by someone who is good<br>
at simplifying things for beginners, then progress into reading<br>
commentary by intermediate-level writers, then finally to reading<br>
critical analysis by other authors in the field.<br>
<p>
The hard part will be extricating the minds of authors from chronic<br>
paper-think that infests the publishing world.  Convincing them that<br>
giving their material away will make them twice as rich as hording<br>
it, especially if they dabble in reviewing each other.<br>
