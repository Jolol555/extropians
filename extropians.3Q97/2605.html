Yes, I agree. It is conceivable that an SI would have conservatism or <br>
naturalness as values. (Presumably because those values were <br>
prevalent in the culture in which it was built, so that these values <br>
were programmed in.) But that's what they are: specific values that <br>
would have to be explicitly added, not something that we can take for <br>
granted.<br>
<p>
In general, I think we can say the following: Sentimentality values <br>
will be less prominent than they are today. By sentimentality values <br>
I mean values that are dependent on an object's historical origin or <br>
specific association with a beloved one etc. Why would they be less <br>
prominent? Because at least in some cases they are valued only <br>
indirectly, for the psychological effects they produce (a curl from a <br>
lost lover elicits memories and nostalgia, for example). But in the <br>
future, these effects will be more efficiently produced by <br>
manipulating the brain or the emotional centres in the <br>
superintelligence (assuming it has bothered to preserve them). <br>
So the physical objects (such as Mother Earth) would no longer be <br>
needed.<br>
