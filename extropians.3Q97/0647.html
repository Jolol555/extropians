<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Even though they finally dug up a minor classified program that they<br>
were able to use to fit the facts that they previously admitted to, the<br>
facts that they have also admitted to destroying all of the paperwork to<br>
do with the incident, and that they don't know who destroyed it, even<br>
though regs for recording of such records destruction were in place at<br>
the time, and the fact that they had to come up with TWO stories to fit<br>
ALL of the public claims about the story merely raise a flag with me. As<br>
I said prevously, I still think that Roswell is in all likelyhood what<br>
it is and is being used by gov't disinformation agencies to develop<br>
misdirection toward their true classified programs. I am not a UFO nut.<br>
I am into researching black programs and bringing them to light, as I<br>
feel that an open society like ours should not have any programs that<br>
the citizenry does not know about. ROswell has come into my radar scope<br>
merely because of all of the interesting inconsistencies that would<br>
raise flags in the mind of an investigator that had not already<br>
prejudicially come to a conclusion about the case.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Nope, it was a report by a soldier who claimed to be at the crash site</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of the full vehicle, not the Brazel ranch.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, if the saucer didn't exist then such reports don't matter. I mean,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I could claim to have been at the crash site and been temporally</i><br>
<i>&gt; distorted to the 1990s, but it wouldn't make it true.</i><br>
<p>
This would be the easiest thing to prove. If you had been temporally<br>
displaced a number of years, and your dissapearance had been documented,<br>
then you would be living proof that such an event occured.<br>
<p>
however, the soldier was not displaced for years, just that he claimed<br>
that what felt like a few minutes inside was actually several hours<br>
outside.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If its all cultural related to current scifi literature projections of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technology, where are the cyber abductions? Where are the "I was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; uploaded by an alien" stories?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How often do you see those on Star Trek? They haven't yet filtered down</i><br>
<i>&gt; into popular culture.</i><br>
<p>
Lets see, Kess had the mind of an alien warlord uploaded to her mind,<br>
then you have the Borg, and there was an episode from the original show<br>
that used a similar device...<br>
<p>
Then you have movies like Johnny Mnemonic and Lawnmower Man and TV shows<br>
like Tek War and VR5, etc..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The reports I've seen said that the materials, when looked at under a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; microscope, looked like they were made up of bazillions of microscopic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; welds.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This would necessitate a welding machine the size of bacteria, eh?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Possibly, but why should anyone believe the reports? And why would anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the ability to build such a machine bother with 'welding'? Why not</i><br>
<i>&gt; just stick it together atom by atom to produce a perfect surface?</i><br>
<p>
Ever hear that a proper weld is stronger than the material being welded?<br>
imagine the whole sheet being nothing but microscopic welds. Perhaps<br>
such a culture has not been able to develop nanotech to the atomic level<br>
that some people here dream about. Maybe they had but it is not<br>
economical and this technique is a good cost effective compromise.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Corso was at the base at the time. This is known.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Interesting; evidence?</i><br>
<p>
Gee, only DOD records, White House pictures, Pentagon phone books, the<br>
usual. He WAS an intelligence officer for several decades and was at<br>
Roswell at  the time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You forget the bureaucratic machine. Don't have something on base?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; where's the right contractor? From what I've seen of Area 51, its all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; contractor run. From my own experience on many bases, most of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; logisitics stuff is handled by civilians and contractors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And you think that such an organisation could keep this 'crashed alien</i><br>
<i>&gt; spacecraft' a secret for thirty-three years? Why is ignoring these</i><br>
<i>&gt; inconsistencies bad for 'debunkers', but fine for believers?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
SOmething as mundane as the SR-71 was kept secret for ten years, as was<br>
the F-117. Lets imagine that our government concluded from the wreckage<br>
that the alleged aliens were from a socialist planet. What do you think<br>
they would have done? THis was the McCarthy era, mind you. Mere actors<br>
were being blacklisted for life just because they refused to lie about<br>
their freinds to congress. The last thing they needed during the entire<br>
cold war, and even today, is for the population at large to know that<br>
there is a superior culture on another planet that they think is<br>
socialist.<br>
<p>
I see nothing inconsistent about it. As a matter of fact, the new<br>
government story proves that they CAN keep a secret for 50 years. They<br>
did not declassify the Mogul project until recently, did they not? and<br>
that, in respect to the greatest event in human history, is a mere<br>
unmentionable footnote. So they can keep a secret for 50 years....<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The photos released were several days later, after Gen Ramey had put the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cover story in place. Considering that weather balloons were heavily</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; used by the weather people on base, gussying up something in a day or so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would be rather easy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So. You have evidence that anything was substituted? *Marcel says that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; photo is genuine*. You disbelieve your prime witness?</i><br>
<p>
Marcel said at the followup press conference where the "evidence" was<br>
presented that this was the "true" wreckage. He later recanted this<br>
according to what I've read.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; According to Brazel, the eve before he initially found the scattered</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; peices (June 15th), he and his family experienced a huge explosive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sound, louder in his opinion than the lightning that was common on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; summer evenings in that area.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmm, do you have a source for this?</i><br>
<p>
The testimony of Brazel and his family. The earlier testimony you posted<br>
was from an interview he gave to the local paper after he had been<br>
detained for two days by the feds. He has said that they worked him over<br>
mentally pretty badly, making all sorts of threats if he opened his<br>
mouth at the time...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But the mogul project was BASED at Roswell. If anyone knew what a Mogul</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; balloon was, it would have been the people at Roswell field.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Alamogordo. Sorry.</i><br>
<p>
Alamagodo is about an hour drive from Roswell....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Anyways, outside of the radio reciever, the mogul balloon was exactly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; like a normal weather balloon. The radar reflectors were for radar</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; tracking of the balloon.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, according to the Sceptical Enquirer:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "While many UFO proponents claim the wreckage shown in General Ramey's</i><br>
<i>&gt; office was just a weather balloon switched for the "real debris," Moore</i><br>
<i>&gt; pointed out that the radar targets used by NYU were unlike anything flown</i><br>
<i>&gt; in New Mexico before and that "they were not available in Fort Worth to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; substituted for the debris in General Ramey's office." Warrant Officer</i><br>
<i>&gt; Newton was able to recognize the debris in General Ramey's office because</i><br>
<i>&gt; he happened to have used an early version of the same targets while</i><br>
<i>&gt; serving as a weatherman in Okinawa. The earlier-model targets Newton used</i><br>
<i>&gt; did not have the reinforcing tape with the pinkish-purple flower designs."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But I guess Moore (one of the Project Mogul scientists) is just part of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government coverup, right?</i><br>
<p>
The purple flower tape was not shown in the photo, nor has it been<br>
recognised by Marcel,as far as I know. <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
