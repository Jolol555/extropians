Ancient biplane used for some of the earliest commercial flights. I think<br>
it was the first biplane with an enclosed cabin for passengers. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; True commercial aircraft are extremely</i><br>

<p>
And the 'saucers' reported by Roswell 'witnesses' aren't? (But odd that<br>
this material which is supposedly so indestructable could be torn into<br>
little pieces in a crash). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Still, a plane with 20,000 flight</i><br>

<i>&gt; interstellar flight of 20 light years at .98 C with no maintenance</i><br>

<p>
Yes, it is. Cruising at 0.98c is hardly a harsh flight regime if you have<br>
a shield ahead to catch debris impacts. After your engines shut down<br>
you're simply cruising for years until you reach your destination. Landing<br>
and take-off are also the most extreme parts of an airliner's flight<br>
regime, but they still have to keep their engines running for the whole<br>
trip. And, of course, the crew can't maintain the plane as it's flying,<br>
which alien astronauts could. <br>
<p>
Let's compare this to shuttle maintenance, qualitatively the closest<br>
current approximation: the effort required to overhaul a shuttle is almost<br>
fixed regardless of whether it's in space for two days or two weeks. The<br>
vast majority of maintenance is related to launch and landing, which both<br>
happen precisely once per flight. Longer flights merely require more minor<br>
maintenance like removing more garbage, adding more fuel for the fuel<br>
cells, greater chance of having to replace a window damaged by debris etc.<br>
The second the shuttle engines ignite you're up for thousands of man-hours<br>
of work, even if it doesn't launch. <br>
<p>
Finally, I find it highly unlikely that aliens as technologically backward<br>
as the Roswell reports imply could travel interstellar distances in their<br>
little saucers. Far more likely they'd be simple planetary transports<br>
which would have been in storage until they reached Earth, then serviced<br>
thoroughly before flight. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Well, one could say that the skunk works guys were the ones who built</i><br>
<i>&gt; it, so that may be an advantage over using high school graduates or</i><br>
<i>&gt; dropouts who were drafted. Plus Kelly Johnson never liked having people</i><br>
<i>&gt; who just did heavy looking on, like so much military work is.</i><br>
<p>
Precisely; and how much of the increase in maintenance on modern military<br>
aircraft is simply an increase in the amount of 'heavy looking on', or<br>
badly-designed maintenance programs? <br>
<p>
Ben Rich mentioned that the massive Air Force oversight to ensure that <br>
they didn't charge for any $600 hammers greatly increased the cost of the <br>
Stealth (not-)Fighter, probably by far more than corruption in the company <br>
could have done. NASA have on occasion found tools inside a shuttle after it <br>
returned and discovered that three inspectors all signed off the forms to <br>
say that those tools were removed. This is why I was concentrating on <br>
commercial aviation, where there's a great incentive to minimize the <br>
required maintenance and oversight. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Additionally, the CIA got a new plane, while the USAF got a well used</i><br>
<i>&gt; plane. Maintenance time goes up with airframe age.</i><br>
<p>
AFAIK the CIA started out with the original single-seat A-12, but the USAF<br>
bought two-seat SR-71s from Lockheed instead; I don't think that any<br>
aircraft were transferred over, but I don't have my books handy to check.<br>
Also, AFAIK NASA were maintaining their SR-71s with a CIA-sized crew, and<br>
those aircraft were around twenty-five years old (although I don't think<br>
they flew as often). <br>
