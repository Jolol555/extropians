     Yes, I'm an elitist of sorts. I'd rather hear Carl Feynman woolgather<br>
     about ways to build craft to explore the Sun's atmosphere than hear<br>
     the empty-headed wannabes mumble along. Why? Because Carl is a better<br>
     thinker and his speculations are thus far more interesting to read,<br>
     that's why. I'd say that Carl is, in fact, "better" than "Danny", at<br>
     least at informed speculation on scientific topics of interest to me.<br>
     <br>
     (And no, I wouldn't mind at all if the fuzzy-headed crowd felt<br>
     insulted and left. In fact, I highly encourage them to do so.)<br>

     I don't know if I fit into your last sanctimoniously-declared category <br>
     but if so, my skin is far thicker.  While I'm not here to duel with <br>
     such negative opinions as your recent post, I am here to learn about <br>
     things (and I've assimilated plenty) AND discuss possibility however <br>
     improbable.  Even something far-fetched has (for me) an amusing <br>
     appeal.  While you regard a contributor such as Danny as some sort of <br>
     gnat-like nuisance, I regard him as simply someone in the process of <br>
     discovery.  <br>
     <br>
     We can discuss Star Trek-style replicator technology (presumably <br>
     because there's some potential science-qualifying banter that can be <br>
     squeezed out of it) but not pole shift.  This is a digest for goodness <br>
     sake!  It amazes me that people get irked by the extra few seconds to <br>
     download something they would eventually judge unworthy or the extra <br>
     pressure they have to exert on the finger they apply to the page down <br>
     key.<br>
     <br>
     If the Extropian Digest of yore was filled with this kind of <br>
     pontifical grandstanding, then apparently a great many of its <br>
     contributors have discovered the wonderous benefits of a good <br>
     laxative.  Check with your local Walgreens.  There's help available. <br>
     &lt;G&gt;<br>
     <br>
     Incidentally, I would say that most of us on this list are elitist <br>
     about one thing or another.  Humility and benevolence, as I have thus <br>
     far observed, are not particularly Extropian traits, at least not in <br>
     any explicit sense.  That's okay.  The ideas are high octane.  I'm <br>
     sure there's a list elsewhere for Mother Teresa and Gandhi fans.<br>
