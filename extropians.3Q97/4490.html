&lt; [Iain M. Banks] latest Culture novel ('Excession') is based around<br>
this [eliminate property by making it sentient] . . . It's not as much<br>
fun as some of his other books and far less coherent, but it's the<br>
first to concentrate on the AIs rather than organics, touches on the<br>
Culture's decision to avoid the Singularity, and shows that he<br>
understands the issues. Plus he includes uploading, identity transfer,<br>
backups etc for the first time. &gt;<br>
<p>
I had not heard of _State of the Art_ which Mark mentions, but a<br>
couple of Banks’ non-Culture novels deal with uploads:<br>
<p>
_Feersum Endjinn_ (1994) sketches the autocratic society of those who<br>
remain behind after humanity’s Diaspora and has lots of misfit uploads<br>
wandering around in the "cryptosphere" (plus some imaginative<br>
macroengineering in the ‘real’ world).  It’s an entertaining account<br>
of what might happen when very high technology is left in the hands of<br>
those who have little idea of how it works, especially as the<br>
Encroachment approaches..<br>
<p>
_The Bridge_ (1986) seemed to be an examination of the economics of<br>
upload psychiatry, masquerading as the gothic dreams of a coma<br>
patient; but, I never finished reading it..<br>

"He had had to use a sword a few times, and - on occasion - opponents<br>
had attempted to best him through other levels of the crypt, imagining<br>
him into situations within which they thought he could more easily be<br>
defeated and absorbed.  He found, however, that he had little<br>
difficulty assuming control in such situations.  Much appeared to<br>
depend on ones’ wit; a general flexibility and quickness of mind plus<br>
an extensive and catholic knowledge-base - as long as these attributes<br>
were combined with a generous dash of ruthlessness - were all that one<br>
really needed to operate successfully within such imagined realms."<br>
- Iain Banks, _Feersum Endjinn_ (p240)<br>
