In a message dated 97-07-13 09:16:11 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Reading your 'how I got here' post reminded me how old I am!  The books<br>
 you use as reference points for example are quite modern, and didn't<br>
 exist at all when I was going through the same kind of process.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Ahh...you're probably not any older than I am...I've got two grandkids.<br>
<p>
But that just illustrates how fast "times they are a changin'".<br>
<p>
Some of the concepts we talk about (seriously...with full expectation of<br>
eventual realization) would have been too radical for even the most fevorous<br>
drug dreams not too long ago.  And here I say "we"...I only managed to get on<br>
board less than a month ago...but I'm having a great time.<br>
<p>
More Books.  Alvin Toffler's  "The Third Wave"...novels by Walter Jon<br>
Williams especially "Aristoi" ..books by Micheal Flyn.<br>
<p>
FYI...Eric Drexler's "Engines of Creation" is available for downloading from<br>
the Foresight Institute's web page.  Julian Simons works are also available<br>
on the web...don't know the exact name of his homepage but a search engine<br>
can find it...or get it from the Gutenberg Project.<br>
