Dear transhumans: <br>
<p>
Over the years, there have been innovations in cryonics not only from a<br>
technological standpoint, but also by ideas developed through various<br>
mediums and approached in countless ways.<br>
<p>
We have innovative writings such as Ettinger's _The Prospect of Immortality_<br>
and "Man into Superman_.  <br>
<p>
Fred and Linda Chamberlain starting Alcor Foundation, Max More starting<br>
Mezar, Paul Wakfer's Prometheus Project, and ideas into articles by Mike<br>
Darwin and Steve Harris.<br>
<p>
There is science fiction such as _Chiller_ by Benford, _Tech-Heaven_ by<br>
Nagata, and _The Door Into Summer_ by Heinlein.<br>
<p>
There is biographical accounts such as _Great Mambo Chicken and the<br>
Transhuman Condition_ by Regis.<br>
<p>
Also, television and film:  _Late for Dinner_, both "Picket Fences" and L.A.<br>
Law" episodes dealing with cryonics.<br>
<p>
There are innovative actions such as outsmarting the Riverside Coroner's<br>
office in preserving Dora Kent's head. And services such as starting of<br>
Cryonet by Kevin Brown.<br>
<p>
Can anyone suggest creative undertakings about or relating to cryonics?<br>
<p>
Thanks!<br>
<p>
