<p>
No, being levelheaded and realistic means looking at the facts as objectively<br>
as possible, being practical, etc.  Check the definitions in any dictionary,<br>
pessimism != realism.  Pessimistic people will often use it a catch-phrase to<br>
support their own slanted view of the world and it's *very important* not to<br>
let them get away with it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To me "be realistic" equals an admonition to be pessimistic.  EXAMPLE:</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Don't try to do something innovative in life and leave a </i><br>
<i>&gt;legacy, you should</i><br>

<p>
But it means nothing of the sort.  You've been had by pessimists good at<br>
debating.  One, properly, should do a cost-benefit for doing something<br>
innovative and leaving a legacy.  If the benefit is high, as it is for most<br>
of us, it will justify a slim chance of success.  Besides, the chance of<br>
doing *something* interesting and new isn't that slim if that's what you try<br>
for.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;If I had been "realistic"  I would have given up looking for my new heat</i><br>

<i>&gt;discovering a new species?  </i><br>
<p>
Of microorganism?  Pretty high.  We certainly know only a small portion of<br>
microorganism species, based on soil DNA studies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Well, I was NOT realistic . . . The new heat</i><br>
<i>&gt;resistant species I discovered is called _Talaromyces trachyspermus_. </i><br>
<p>
Well, congratulations.<br>
