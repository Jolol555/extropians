I must of necessity keep this brief, because I am presently battling an <br>
illness that brings on bouts of fatigue, and I am trying to get over <br>
it before next weekend, but two notes:<br>
<p>
In re Shaun Russell's comments about 'rights groups':  I share many <br>
of your concerns, Shaun, and have spent much of my semiretirement as <br>
an activist trying to help my core groups overcome some of those <br>
pitfalls.  But I have found in working on several issue areas, <br>
including women's rights, peace, etc., that gay issues really cluster <br>
around the type of 'ground zero' issues that relate to basic human <br>
existence and self-determination.  Some time is devoted to fluff <br>
issues involving terminology and whatnot, but most time is spent on <br>
the more serious elements of societal coexistence, and the everpresent <br>
threat of violence directed against the community helps to focus <br>
people.  <br>
<p>
In re Natasha's response to my posting:  I must confess to a bit of <br>
confusion about your reply, because you seem to have broadened your <br>
initial statement to include other groups, whereas I originally <br>
understood you to be making an assessment of the power that my <br>
community supposedly has right now.  And, in comparing the two <br>
assessments, I would tend to give more weight to the assessment of the <br>
persons living and working within that community, as I would with <br>
such an assessment about any community or group.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
