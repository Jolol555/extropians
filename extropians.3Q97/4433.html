(big snip)<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Otherwise you'd be throwing, say, European left-anarchist values at</i><br>
<i>&gt; American</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;right-anarchist values, and making a mess.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's true that the two trends of anarchism have difficulties to cohabit. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; was accustomed to left anarchist values when I first meet the extropians</i><br>
<i>&gt; more than one year ago (through the transhuman list), and it was a real</i><br>
<i>&gt; "cultural shock!". Only now I begin to understand the values of these</i><br>
<i>&gt; strange animals (I continue to disagree, but, at least, I understand).</i><br>
<i>&gt; This kind of debate always remind me "Illuminatus"  this card with two</i><br>
<i>&gt; faces one saying "property is theft" the other "property is liberty". This</i><br>
<i>&gt; depends, says Wilson, of the meaning of "property" One is property of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; means of production; the second is property of personal objects.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Right-winged anarchism goes too far (IMHO) when it suggest the</i><br>
<i>&gt; privatization of all (such as for instance, oxygen supply in an O'Neill</i><br>
<i>&gt; cylinder), and left anarchism is wong when it contests the property of</i><br>
<i>&gt; personal goods (for instance, Emmet Grogan, leader of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarcho-socialists Diggers, telling Allen Ginsberg he was an ugly</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalist, only because he wanted  to retire in a house with a garden!).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Are right and left anarchism really opposite ideologies ? sometimes, there</i><br>
<i>&gt; can be a fruitful collaboration. The best example, IMO, is the GNU project,</i><br>
<i>&gt; a pure anarcho-socialist project (no property of information!) which gave</i><br>
<i>&gt; birth to successful companies such as Cygnus.</i><br>
(snip ditto)<br>
<p>
Remi: Absolutely, these are diametrically opposed and incompatible<br>
ideologies: this is a purely ethical issue: by what right would the<br>
state or your "brothers" own the means of production or any part of what<br>
you had worked for?  While it is the belief of many<br>
objectivist-libertarian types that the mixed economy is inherently<br>
unstable, it is the case that the mixed economy is unethical because<br>
individuals are entitled to maintain the rights to and distribute as<br>
they see fit, the fruits of their productive behavior. How does who<br>
decide who is more entitled to own and distribute what I produce than I<br>
myself?  If anarchy is freedom from statism, then what structure do you<br>
propose to cooperatively steal my goods and redistribute? And how do you<br>
intend to keep me producing under this situation?  Read &lt;i&gt;Atlas<br>
Shrugged&lt;/i&gt;!<br>
