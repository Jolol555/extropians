     As a follow up to my initial response to Hagbard's question, I first <br>
     want to express my concern that some may interpret my questions as <br>
     inquisitional and pontifical in nature.  <br>
     <br>
     I am trying to get a better understanding of the classic Extropian <br>
     mentality, only essences of which I comfortably subscribe but I find <br>
     them a fascinating group nonetheless.  While the particular tactics I <br>
     may use provoke, it is not intended to offend.  <br>
     <br>
     However, instead of posing the questions in a way that seeks to cement <br>
     credibility for me at the expense of personal alienation of the <br>
     subscribers to this digest, let me instead, share what measures I take <br>
     and would like to take to ensure the quality of my physical health and <br>
     vitality into "old age" (although I'm quite optimistic ours may be the <br>
     first generation to cinch that destiny).<br>
     <br>
     * My diet is predominantly vegetarian and predominantly organically <br>
     tended.  <br>
     * I supplement with a number of minerals and am researching other <br>
     tonics to add to my regimen.  This is right now, somewhat adhoc.  I'd <br>
     like to consult a nutritionist to get a more personalized regimen.<br>
     * I stay out of the sun and if I am in the sun for long periods of <br>
     time, I wear sunscreen, shades, hat.  <br>
     * I perform facial exercises and moisturize and exfoliate the skin on <br>
     my face and neck.<br>
     * I exercise three times a week and would like to increase that <br>
     because the number of calories I consume compared to my metabolic rate <br>
     isn't as it was in my 20s.<br>
     * Psyllium shakes on a fairly "regular" basis &lt;G&gt;<br>
     <br>
     I'd actually like to get more ideas on what people do to ensure the <br>
     quality of their physical health.<br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
