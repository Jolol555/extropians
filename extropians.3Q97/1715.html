Eric Watt Forste &lt;arkuat@pobox.com&gt;,<br>
<p>
	You criticized some of den Otter's &lt;otter@globalxs.nl&gt;<br>
comments which were in partial agreement with some of the ideas I've<br>
also posted and am struggling with.  I have very much respect for<br>
people like you, Max, and many others which have time and time again<br>
successfully convinced me of your correctness through argumentation.<br>
To some degree, then, I surrender some of my self ownership to such<br>
people which I consider to be more of an expert or an authority than I<br>
am.  I'm sure that there are at least a few people on this planet that<br>
know what is better for me better than I know what is better for me.<br>
I try to listen intently and give head to such people, especially<br>
whenever they disagree with some point of view I previously thought<br>
was correct.  I'm only an average Joe and certainly not the smartest<br>
person in the world.<br>
<p>
	Here you are, apparently, at least partially, disagreeing with<br>
my thinking that it might be ok for someone to force someone to do<br>
something IF they know, absolutely, that that is what is right for<br>
that person.  (i.e. a Mother knows a toddler should not wander into a<br>
busy street and forcefully prevents them from doing so.)<br>
<p>
	So anyway, let me ask you a question I've been struggling with<br>
about what the proper behavior should be.  Lets say you have a very<br>
close loved one.  Say it is one of your children or something.  Lets<br>
say he's about 17 years old and you know that throughout his life he<br>
has consistently expressed a desire to not be cryonically preserved -<br>
possibly because he is a totally convinced member of some religion<br>
which is against it.  Let's call him Jeff.  You figure Jeff hasn't<br>
really seriously considered dieing or whether he would really want to<br>
be preserved because he is so young even though he has several times<br>
explicitly said to you he did not want to make any effort to be<br>
preserved.<br>
<p>
	Suddenly, Jeff is involved in an instantaneous, life taking,<br>
but not brain destroying accident.  In other words, without expecting<br>
to die he doesn't get the chance to, with his final breaths, say: "I<br>
don't (or do) want to be cryonically preserved."  Let's say there just<br>
happens to be a cryonic team there, ready to preserve him, and that<br>
funds for the procedure and long term preservation are absolutely no<br>
problem.  Let's say the decision is entirely up to you.  In other<br>
words there are no other significant family or friends of the person.<br>
The cryonics team is awaiting your (as his parent and soul guardian)<br>
answer to their question:<br>
<p>
	"Do we preserve him or don't we?"<br>
<p>
	What would you tell them to do?<br>
<p>
	I ask anyone that is a better moral expert than I, what should<br>
I do?<br>
<p>
