Good point. I have been looking at the Swedish political arena<br>
for some time, and it is very clear that it is not intended for <br>
the benefits of humans, just a group of organizations. After all,<br>
we do not elect individual politicians, just their parties,<br>
and through memetic selection organizations which make the<br>
fitness lansdcape nicer for organizations will prosper. There<br>
are some interesting cases of co-evolution and symbiosis <br>
(I suppose one could call it conspiracy, but I prefer a biological<br>
formalism) which leads to the formation of stable structures<br>
with very little interest in individual humans. Of course,<br>
many humans adapt to this to get maximal benefit from the present<br>
structures, creating career politicians, bureaucrats and wellfare-<br>
addicts.<br>
<p>
All in all, it seems that our problem is that we have metaorganisms<br>
around that doesn't help, and often hinder, transhuman progress.<br>
The big question is how to deal with this, and what kinds of interactions<br>
(and ethics) we should develop between individuals and metaorganisms.<br>
