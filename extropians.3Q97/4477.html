Hi!<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Like I mentioned before, I know the meaning of the word but I couldn't</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argument, in explaining to me the author's (EvMich) point of view. Like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I said a thousand times, I don't know nothing of economics</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; or english grammar ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Why do you say that? Most people I met in the Internet say I have an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; excellent English. Even when I go abroad and have to speak English,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; no-one has ever said I had a bad knowledge of the English language,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you're the first and I would like to know why.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I apoligize sincerely, it was a very mean thing for me to point out.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; general, your grammar is very good-- probably better than mine; however,</i><br>
<i>&gt; my little remark was in reference to your statement "I don't know nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt; of economics."  When you say "don't know nothing," that is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; double-negative.  It's almost as big a mistake as when I finish half my</i><br>
<i>&gt; sentences with a preposition.  Ah, we're Science students, we don't know</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing about grammar, do we?</i><br>
<p>
Apologies accepted (was the "apoligize" error intentional?) and, yes,<br>
you're right, I should have written "I know nothing", in Portuguese (as<br>
well as other languages that come from Latin such as Spanish) a<br>
double-negative such as this one is correct.<br>
Answering your question, I think we should know about grammar, rhetoric<br>
and even marketing. Remember that when searching for, say, a job, it's<br>
not who you are that matters, it's what the employer thinks you are. I<br>
read some things about marketing, I read a book about arguing and I<br>
worked hard to improve my vocabulary (both in English and Portuguese).<br>
It doesn't matter if you are a good professional if the others don't<br>
think the same way! Of course that being a good professional is<br>
important to impress others but, personally, I know lots of incompetents<br>
with great jobs and fame and lots of brilliant persons who are<br>
unemployed. Also from personal experience, my writing skills (which are<br>
not exceptional but do the work) have surely earned me many points in<br>
exams on those questions one is not particularly sure about the answer,<br>
know what I mean?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;The more people try to solve the aging problem, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; quicker will it be solve, the better for all of us, including myself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Answering your question, if someone woke me up to ask me how to play a B</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; chord, I would be upset because that persons disturbed my sleep.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As some people on this list are disturbed by the massive amount of mail in</i><br>
<i>&gt; their box every day from people asking the same basics questions, over and</i><br>
<i>&gt; over.</i><br>
<p>
Do you want to compare the trouble of replying to a couple of messages<br>
once in a while (which can be a matter of days, weeks or months but no<br>
less than that) with the agony of not being able to sleep? It's two<br>
completely things, the word "disturbed" has two different meanings in<br>
the two sentences.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; A better example is my aging research,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the more people I can teach about aging, the more people will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; interested and start researching and the more people would try to solve</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the aging problem. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And so you must weigh the advantages of spending your time teaching others</i><br>
<i>&gt; and spending your time actually doing research.  When you spend too much</i><br>
<i>&gt; time teaching others, you have to cut back so you can do more research.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is all anyone on the list is saying: too much time is being spent on</i><br>
<i>&gt; answering basic questions(as opposed to more complicated and unanswered</i><br>
<i>&gt; question), so people asking these questions are being discouraged in</i><br>
<i>&gt; favour of going and reading a book.</i><br>
<p>
I saved this reply for later, as a sort of finishing touch, I think that<br>
with the amount of people asking this kind of questions (in the last<br>
week I think that was just me, not too much), you don't have an arguing<br>
base to complain. As I said before, I respect your positions and I shall<br>
ask no more basic questions but I think that if you spent a few minutes<br>
per week answering basic questions that wouldn't do you any harm, that<br>
wouldn't disturb you and in the end you would convert more persons to<br>
your ideas.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; If I told you "the A chord isn't actually an A, it's a B flat", you would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; say I'm wrong.  What if I replied: "I don't believe you, but I don't want</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; to read any books on subject... maybe I will eventually get around to it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; In the mean time, I don't believe you.  It's obvious that the A chord is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; actually B flat, I don't understand how you can even begin to think it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; not."  Wouldn't that make you a little frustrated? (come on, be honest ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yes but if you ask 100 guitar player what is an A chord, they will ALL</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; give you the same answer. However, if you ask 100 economists if</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; free-markets are the best solutions, they won't give you the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; answer.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have yet to have an economics professor or teaching assistant who</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't think a free-market is the best solution.  If you admit you</i><br>
<i>&gt; haven't read any books on economics, how can you make this statement?</i><br>
<p>
Personally I never had any teacher of economics because I never had to<br>
learn economics in scholastic life but just because I don't read any<br>
books that doesn't mean I don't know anything about it. I read the daily<br>
newspaper, I watch TV, I read books that mention economical issues, I<br>
talk with other persons about economics, I manage my own money, I buy<br>
and sell things, I'm no ignorant and, fortunately, I have the ability to<br>
think based on observations. Just because I don't have a Ph.D. in<br>
economics that doesn't mean I don't have the ability to talk about<br>
economical issues. And I do know economists that don't see free-markets<br>
as the best solution.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Free-markets is not (at least for many people) the best</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; solution, it's not the ultimate truth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, but what is?</i><br>
<p>
That is what I would like to find out. I asked my original questions<br>
because I wanted to see if free-markets was a possible solution to many<br>
of the world's problems.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; An A chord is always an A chord</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and if anyone disagrees on that he is immediately wrong,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think you should go to your local library or even the internet, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; search for the word "epistemology" before you make a statement like that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What makes you so sure?   Why is he "immediately wrong"?</i><br>
<p>
Come on, a philosophical discussion now!? You know what I mean. <br>
