OK, I'll try to reconstruct wat transpired ;-) Hopefully this will clear<br>
any misunderstandings and allow us to move on.<br>
Sorry for usage of all the bandwith.<br>
<p>
First I posted something in response &amp; support of Paul Hughes' post "Re:<br>
Extropianis (Protestants in Disguise?)" about the apparent virtue that many<br>
Extropians seem to place in Hard Work.<br>
<p>
Below that post I put a text the I had received sometime ago from<br>
www.inspire.com about the danger of fixation on hard work<br>
Ii posted it because I consider it makes a clear point in a very eloquent<br>
manner:<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
QUANTUM_LEAP<br>
<p>
"I'm sitting in a quiet room at the Millcroft Inn, a peaceful little place<br>
hidden back among the pine trees about an hour out of Toronto.  It's just<br>
past noon, late July, and I'm listening to the desperate sounds of a life<br>
or death struggle going on a few feet away. <br>
<p>
There's a small fly burning out the last of its short life's energies in a<br>
futile attempt to fly through the glass of the windowpane.  The whining<br>
wings tell the poignant story of the fly's strategy - try harder. <br>
<p>
But it's not working. <br>
<p>
The frenzied effort offers no hope for survival. Ironically, the struggle<br>
is part of the trap. It is impossible for the fly to try hard enough to<br>
succeed at breaking through the glass. Nevertheless, this little insect<br>
has staked its life on reaching its goal through raw effort and<br>
determination. <br>
<p>
This fly is doomed. It will die there on the windowsill. Accross the<br>
room ten steps away, the door is open. Ten seconds of flying time and this<br>
small creature could reach the outside world it seeks.  With only a<br>
fraction of the effort now being wasted, it could be free of this<br>
self-imposed trap.  The breakthrough possibility is there.  It would be so<br>
easy. <br>
<p>
Why doesn't this fly try another approach, something dramatically<br>
different?  How did it get so locked in on the idea that this particular<br>
route, and determined effort, offer the most promise for success?  What<br>
logic is there in continuing, until death, to seek a breakthrough with<br>
'more of the same?'<br>
<p>
No doubt this approach makes sense to the fly.  Regrettably it's an idea<br>
that will kill. <br>
<p>
'Trying harder' isn't necessarily the solution to achieving more.  It may<br>
not offer any real promise for giving what you want out of life. <br>
Sometimes, in fact, it's a big part of the problem. <br>
<p>
If you stake your hopes for a breakthrough on trying harder than ever, you<br>
may kill your chances of success. <br>
<p>
Self-discipline and persistence are true virtues.  Over a lifetime they<br>
can make a powerful contribution to success and achievement.  They are<br>
fundamental to the development of your talents. It's extremely important<br>
to apply yourself diligently, and sometimes, staying power is what<br>
delivers a big win. <br>
<p>
But ordinarily, you will find that trying harder produces only incremental<br>
gains, not quantum leaps. Also, keep in mind that sometimes trying harder<br>
(even a lot harder) offers little more than a straight path to burnout. <br>
Attempting to succeed through 'more of the same,' being resolute and<br>
relying on committed effort, can blind you to better pathways. <br>
<p>
If you want to make a quantum leap, quit thinking about trying harder. <br>
More effort isn't the answer. Get ruthless about trying something<br>
different?  Abandon the status quo. Change your behaviour. Look for a<br>
paradoxical move.  Ricochet? If you're trying to climb over the wall,<br>
open a door and walk through. If you're pushing against the river, try<br>
going with the flow.  Use finesse instead of effort. The tendency when<br>
you stall out or begin to level off in your performance is to go back to<br>
the basics and 'do what you do best.' But doing what you do best could be<br>
the worst thing you could do.<br>
<p>
Quantum leaps come when you seek the elegant solution.  So look for an<br>
approach characterized by simplicity, precision, effeciency and neatness. <br>
Call for a fresh perspective, a deft move, a path of less resistance. <br>

Then Rick came in:<br>

<i> &gt;Thanx Rick, again (for clarity) I posted that story underneath, and</i><br>
<i> &gt;seperatly from the main post, not to make a specific point but just because</i><br>
<i> &gt;I consider it very enlighting. I did not refer to any listmembers</i><br>
whatsoever.<br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Having susrvived many thing that I shouldn't have statistically, I am</i><br>
<i> &gt;generally very optimistic about what can be done about al kind of problems</i><br>
<i> &gt;(let's call them challenges, much better ;-).</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt;     Peace</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;The world is always in short-supply of that. I do not Expect that we will</i><br>
<i> &gt;settle all our differences anywhere soon, that's OK. Diversity is good. It</i><br>
<i> &gt;prevents you from becoming lazy about your beliefs. Could we maybe, sort-of</i><br>
<i> &gt;turn all the political threads into problem-solving-oriented discussions?</i><br>
<i> &gt;(don't get me wrong I'm just as guilty as anyone in 'defending my belief')</i><br>
<i> &gt;Point some of our combined brain-power to currently feasable solutions for</i><br>
<i> &gt;some of the worlds worst economic &amp; social problems.</i><br>
<i> &gt;We have more resouces (mental, informational) than 99,5% of the global</i><br>
<i> &gt;population, anyone interested in putting some of it to work for their</i><br>
benefit?<br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I was thinking about things like cheap medicine produced in the milk of</i><br>
<i> &gt;genetically-engineered cows/sheep. Making the first cow is of course very</i><br>
<i> &gt;complex and expensive. But once you have a working model they reproduce</i><br>
<i> &gt;themselves (well almost ;-). This is the kind of technology that can be</i><br>
<i> &gt;implemented *today* (we have a prototype bull here in Holland) and be put</i><br>
<i> &gt;to work at very low cost in third-world countries, requiring only a simple</i><br>
<i> &gt;infrastucture and little knowledge from the endusers.</i><br>
<i> &gt;Millions of lives could be saved at only minimal cost to all of us (the</i><br>
<i> &gt;reseach would pay for itself problably, we need medicine too).</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Ideas on stuff like this anyone?</i><br>
<p>
Are we clear on this? I think that's about it, sorry everyone for the<br>
consumption of precious bandwith.<br>
I think any other communication on this should be done off-list ;-)<br>
