John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt;,<br>
<p>
	Thanks for your obviously well informed answers. (and more<br>
importantly for clearly understanding what I was so poorely trying to<br>
ask. ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Backward causality? Splitting universes? Observer defined reality? I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't know, I do know that something very weird is going on.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, for sure.  I just don't understand why people insist on<br>
taking it clear to being dependent on being consciously observed or<br>
represented.  Why not just accept the much simpler: any macro physical<br>
representation of the event (i.e. a firing neuron or switching<br>
transistor, orientation of magnetic flux on tape...) be considered an<br>
"observation"?  What does a phenomenal conscious representation of the<br>
event have (especially since it is so causally separated from the<br>
actual event) that any other macro physical representation of the<br>
event (many of which are causally much closer to the quantum event)<br>
doesn't have?  What on earth is the reason for bring consciousness<br>
into it is what I always wonder.  It does nothing but make things<br>
infinitely more complex doesn't it?  A clear violation of Occam's<br>
razor?  Wasn't this what the Schrodinger's (sp?) cat idea was meant to<br>
point out?<br>
