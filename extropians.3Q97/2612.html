The National Food Processors Association (NFPA) and the USDA wants FDA to<br>
lift the ban on meat irradiation to prevent food poisoning such as Hudson<br>
Food's ground beef:<br>
 <br>
     WASHINGTON, Aug. 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Efforts by the U.S. Department of<br>
Agriculture to help ensure the safety of the nation's food supply "should<br>
focus on preventing food safety problems, rather than on unnecessarily<br>
expanding USDA's enforcement powers," according to Dane Bernard, Vice<br>
President of Food Safety Programs for the National Food Processors<br>
Association<br>
(NFPA).<br>
<p>
     It is NFPA's belief that USDA should focus its resources on *prevention*<br>
of <br>
food safety problems, rather than on greater recall *authority.*  More than<br>
four <br>
years ago, USDA asked FDA to approve the use of food irradiation -- a <br>
treatment that kills pathogens such as _E. coli_ 0157:H7 and _Salmonella_ --<br>
on <br>
red meat.  This scientifically proven safe and effective technology has<br>
already been approved for a number of other food products, such as fruits,<br>
vegetables and poultry.  Irradiation for food has been endorsed by an array<br>
of national and international food safety and health experts. USDA should<br>
press FDA to act now.  The safety studies have all been completed and have<br>
passed multiple peer reviews four years ago.  The FDA should not wait to make<br>
this important food safety tool available for use on meat. <br>
