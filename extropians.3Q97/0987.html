In a message dated 97-07-22 05:17:20 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I don't get it.  Yes, the plates move in different directions,<br>
 that's obvious.  If every pair of nearby plates were converging<br>
 (or diverging), the planet would have to be shrinking (or growing).<br>
 I can't visualize what Shaun is suggesting here - that two plates<br>
 may approach each other without colliding?  Or that some collisions<br>
 have a lateral component (that can't be surprising)?<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Actually the planet has been growing, when the planet was one land mass, it<br>
was 80% the size of what it is today.  They can tell by the way the<br>
continents fit.<br>
