<i>&gt;    It's ironic Lee that you and I have so much in common that you can't </i><br>
<i>&gt; see past your passionate opinions of things to see what I'm really </i><br>
<i>&gt; asking.  First of all, I never once said PICS &lt;itself&gt; can or cannot be </i><br>
<i>&gt; used to censor anything.  In fact since I know very little about PICS, I </i><br>
<i>&gt; haven't stated anything affirmative about PICS at all.  Perhaps my </i><br>
<i>&gt; questions were not worded precisely enough to fit your semantic </i><br>
<i>&gt; prejudices. Thus, your responses to my QUESTIONS have been off base. </i><br>
<i>&gt; This seems to me that your more interested in showing off your opinions, </i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than to constructively answer my specific questions.  If this is </i><br>
<i>&gt; not the case, then I will try for round 3.  I hope this time my </i><br>
<i>&gt; questions are worded in such a way as to not upset your sensabilities.</i><br>
<p>
I'm really trying to understand what you are asking, and doing my best<br>
to answer, despite your belief that I am not.  It is not possible for you<br>
to "upset my sensibilities"--they are mine alone.  If I become upset,<br>
that's my fault, not yours.  I answered you specifically, constructively,<br>
meaningfully, and in direct response to your questions.  I did not evade<br>
or equivocate, and I did not impugn your motives--in fact I don't give a<br>
damn about your motives nor should you about mine--and I gave you useful<br>
and complete information.  If it wasn't the answer you wanted then you<br>
need to ask a different question, and I will respond to that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    Is there a way for PEOPLE to get around other PEOPLE &lt;using&gt; filters </i><br>
<i>&gt; to censor them without their consent?  For example, is there a way for a </i><br>
<i>&gt; clever enough Chineese citizen to gain access to those parts of the Net </i><br>
<i>&gt; the Chinnees Government has blocked? Can a high-level filtering system </i><br>
<i>&gt; be hacked?  And if so, how?</i><br>
<p>
A much more detailed question, unfortunately it's not answerable.  It's<br>
like answering "Can software be hacked?"  Of course some can, and some<br>
can't.   None of that has anything to do with PICS.  A PICS bureau is a<br>
source of information, nothing more.  I don't know how to answer your<br>
questions any more specifically or accurately than that.  Are there<br>
social implication of PICS?  Of course, the same as there are social<br>
implications of any information.  Will some people use that to keep<br>
information from people?  Probably.  What can be done?  Well, if the<br>
censoring software can be hacked, then hack it; that depends on the<br>
software, not on PICS.  I suspect that in the age of satellite net<br>
conections, it will be practically impossible for such a system to work,<br>
because PICS can only /add/ data to the system, and it's hard to<br>
restrict which software people use when it too is available on the<br>
net and software without restrictions is easier to create and more<br>
profitable than software with restrictions.<br>
