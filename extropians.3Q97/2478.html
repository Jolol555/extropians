Dan@Clemmensen.ShireNet.com (Dan Clemmensen):<br>
<i>&gt;I would be very interested in discussions on the era leading up to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Singularity. In particular, what can we do to minimize societal upheaval</i><br>
<i>&gt;while accelerating the pace of technological advance?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, this is probably a fruitful area of inquiry. <br>
<p>
Some things worth considering:<br>
<p>
How well do people in general adapt to change, and how much do they<br>
like it? Are there basic traits of flexibility? Can flexibility be<br>
nurtured by culture or amplified artificially? <br>
<p>
In the future scenarios developed by Aleph, I noticed recently that<br>
catastrophe theory could be applied to society. Essentially the<br>
catastrophe surface was controlled by the parameters of how much<br>
society tried to control new technology (social impact statements vs.<br>
invent whatever you like) and how well it adapted to new technology<br>
("Internet is a fad" (an actual quote from the Swedish communications<br>
minister!) vs. "Let's use this, with some caution"). I found that<br>
at least in our scenarios (which may or may not reflect reality)<br>
a catastrophe could occur if society didn't adapt; when a society<br>
attempting to control technology fails, or when a previously free <br>
society due to popular pressure really enforces technology controls,<br>
a very fast transition can occur if the society has not adapted to<br>
the technology, likely with social upheaval as a result. Besides, <br>
in the no adapption case the internal tensions in society were higher.<br>
<p>
[Note: in only one of the four scenarios was a singularity a noticeable<br>
future possibility; in one other it might occur, but a more likely <br>
long-term future would be a branching of humanity into very different<br>
directions, and in a third it might occur further in the future based<br>
on a non-western culture]<br>
<p>
How will economy change in the time up to the singularity? Can today's<br>
corporations adapt fast enough, or will the break up?<br>
