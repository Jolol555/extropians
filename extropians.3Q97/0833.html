<i>&gt;&gt; So, in an anarchic (or market-like) school, what do you have to show the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; employers?  You need something more consise that the entire portfolio of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; work, and you'd like something that helps them rank you in relation to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; other applicants.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I do lots of interviewing, and frankly I'd love to see a world in</i><br>
<i>&gt;which we ended the idea of degrees. I've seen too many people who knew</i><br>
<i>&gt;what they were doing and had no degrees, and vice versa.</i><br>
<p>
Yes the signal has noise.  But it is not all noise.  The solution<br>
isn't to throw away the signal, but to find less noisy signals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I rarely even am as concerned about what someone knows as I am with</i><br>
<i>&gt;their work habits and whether they can think. </i><br>
<p>
But can you design a credential/test which strongly correlates with<br>
these features?  If you could, and if others employers value these<br>
features like you do, you could make a *lot* of money creating a<br>
credentially service.<br>
<p>
A pretty-free market currently provides certain credentails, and the<br>
market is pretty open to those who want to market new credentials.  So<br>
if you think you have a good idea for a product here, I encourage you<br>
to create it.  But in the absence of much serious effort here, I think<br>
it is also reasonable for the rest of us to think that it is pretty<br>
hard to beat the existing educational credentialing services.<br>
<p>
I've always been curious why IQ scores don't appear on resumes.  IQ is<br>
a well documented and studied credential shown to have high<br>
correlation with future success.  Personal interviews, in contrast,<br>
look really lousy in academic studies.  Is it a signaling problem,<br>
where anyone who would choose to put their high IQ on their resume is<br>
likely a member of a small subset of the high IQ folks who you don't<br>
want?<br>
