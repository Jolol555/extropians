Actually, in the U.S. this situation is changing (I guess it all<br>
depends<br>
on the perceived threat model of the local authorities.)  Tim McVeigh<br>
used<br>
an ammonium nitrate bomb and so large purchases of it are being<br>
passively<br>
monitored, although it is still easy enough to steal and just about<br>
every<br>
farm in the country has enough to make a reasonably sized boom.  As<br>
far as<br>
nerve gas goes, this is also fairly easy to make (although this fact<br>
is less<br>
widely known since there are few "how to make Sarin" texts floating<br>
around<br>
the Internet :)  Sarin was actually discovered almost accidentally<br>
just<br>
prior to WWII and it is only a few steps removed from insecticides,<br>
anyone<br>
with a decent background in organic chemistry can make it.<br>
Biological<br>
agents are more difficult to come by and that is mostly because after<br>
it<br>
was discovered that the Japanese cult which gassed a subway station<br>
had<br>
been trying to get Anthrax specimens the controls on who gets viral<br>
samples<br>
were tightened up.  On the other hand most bio labs are poorly<br>
secured and<br>
a simple break-in or even armed robbery will probably get you what<br>
you need.<br>
<p>
Nuclear weapons are the only mass-destruction weapons which require a<br>
large<br>
infrastructure to create.  The number of countries which have<br>
admitted to<br>
having chemical weapons now that a ban is in place has proven to be<br>
quite<br>
surprising, and after looking at the list of those countries which<br>
were<br>
suspected of having such weapons it becomes quite apparent just how<br>
easy<br>
they are to make...<br>
