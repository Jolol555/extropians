<i>&gt; Sure, but it seems to me that most serious outbreaks of military</i><br>
<i>&gt; disorderliness nowadays are civil wars, not international wars. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't think of any reasons to believe that a world government would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be a more effective means of reducing the risk of total annihilation</i><br>
<i>&gt; from civil wars than the current setup, or an even more decentralized</i><br>
<i>&gt; setup.</i><br>
<p>
UN has terminated the shooting in Bosnia, and there is some hope that <br>
the peace will hold, though a shortage of resources might force a <br>
withdrawal of the Nato troops next year. There are several other <br>
examples of successful UN peace keeping missons (and some of failed <br>
ones), but this is still a rather new phenomenon and learning is <br>
still in progress, so I think there is room for hope, especially if <br>
the UN is given adequate funding.<br>

<i>&gt;  &gt; What are your grounds for thinking that a reformed, democratic</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; United Nations would provoke and escalate mote disputes than it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; would settle?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because, for instance, the reformed democratic government that I</i><br>
<i>&gt; endure, the federal government of the United States of America and</i><br>
<i>&gt; its wholly-owned subsidiaries, provokes and escalates more disputes</i><br>
<i>&gt; than it settles.  One could mention the police execution of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Black Panther leadership in Chicago a couple decades ago, or the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mess in Waco, Texas a few years ago.</i><br>
<p>
Small potatoes!.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Many wars seem to originate in differing interpretations of some</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; legal or historical circumstance. I have often thought, oh, if</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; there only were an impartial arbiter to which the rivalling nations</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; could submit their cases, and a responsible international force</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; that could implement the judgements.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What makes you think that a reformed, democratic United Nations</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be impartial? (Or that their international force would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsible, though I find this far easier to imagine than an</i><br>
<i>&gt; impartial United Nations. The current United Nations is</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely partial.)</i><br>
<p>
UN itself would not need to be impartial (though it would presumably <br>
be much less partial that the parts that are fighting), it would <br>
only need to implement the decisions of some independent tribunal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; The only realistic candidates in the foreseeable future are either</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; the UN or a coalition led by the USA. I think it is dubious that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; most people would accept the USA as an international Dad in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; long run.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think any increase in the influence that the US federal government</i><br>
<i>&gt; has over world affairs would be disastrous.  It has far too much</i><br>
<i>&gt; busybody meddling influence as it is.  I find both of your "realistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; candidates" quite frightening.</i><br>
<p>
The future is frightening, be brave.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; I would suggest a reformed UN in which the USA and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; other powers had an influence that were in some proportion to their</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; real power.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What the heck is "real power" and how do you propose to measure</i><br>
<i>&gt; it? (I hope you're not going to say "in watts". ;)</i><br>
<p>
By real power I mean the power they have in the world as opposed to <br>
the power they have within the present UN. I don't have any specific <br>
proposals for how to measure it, but I think a UN is less likely to <br>
function well if some nations perceive that they are <br>
underrepresented. (A rough measure of real power would be GNP.)<br>
