I wouldn't agree or disagree.  It's worth researching, obviously, but I<br>
don't know what "likely" means here.  It's a complex subject we don't<br>

"Sizable" is vague.  One city fighting off a planet of goo might lose.<br>
One half of a planet could fight off another half, particularly since in<br>
all the scenarios I've seen most of the brains are on the defense.<br>
And there's still the possibility that most of the biosphere is already<br>

"Certain minimum technology level" is completely vague.  You can shift<br>
the levels on either side to force whatever result you want.  And I<br>
think I disagree with the claim in general anyway: the natures of the<br>
"island" and "sea" do matter.  A spore surrounded by white blood cells<br>
and a city surrounded by whatnot are not the same thing.  A city can<br>
defeat a first wave and then cannibalize the remains, becoming stronger.<br>
The spread of civilization, except here the wild comes to the city<br>
rather than vice versa.<br>
