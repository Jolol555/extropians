<i>&gt;         &gt;one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So as I understand it, everybody could vote for anybody and the top 500 vote</i><br>

<i>&gt; and soap opera actors would be in this select group, even if they didn't want</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be and had no wish to be in the legislature.</i><br>
<p>
Not at all; I didn't say anything about electing people without their<br>
permission.  That's no better than jury duty.  Besides, the sports heroes,<br>
game show hosts, and soap opera actors can become Guardians, or maybe Lesser<br>
Guardians or Guardians-At-Large.  That's what the House of Decoys is for.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, you can forget about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the secret ballet, who voted for who would have to be a matter of public</i><br>
<i>&gt; record so they'd know where to send the bill to in case your man makes a fool</i><br>
<i>&gt; of himself and actually votes for something.</i><br>
<p>
Is the amount you now pay in taxes a matter of public record?  I don't see how<br>
this changes anything.  [Just completed my 1040 - you think you have it bad, I<br>
didn't even get to vote!]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Lots of people would get tired</i><br>
<i>&gt; of paying for things their fool representative did years ago, and feel</i><br>
<i>&gt; resentment knowing that their neighbor doesn't pay a dime, they'd move,</i><br>
<i>&gt; change their name and disappear, even more would refuse to vote at all.</i><br>
<p>
People evade our mandatory taxes; I don't see how having a say in the matter<br>
would make things worse.  And if people don't vote at all, they (might) still<br>
have to pay for military spending or some such.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I was forced to vote I'd vote for myself because I'd know I wouldn't win,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or I'd go for a Casper Milktoast who vowed to collect his salary, sit on his</i><br>
<i>&gt; ass and not do one damn thing.</i><br>
<p>
Gee, I guess the government wouldn't spend much, then.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;So no more pork</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Absolutely true, no more spending of any kind. Come to think of it, your idea</i><br>
<i>&gt; isn't so bad after all.</i><br>
<p>
"He has discovered our secret!"<br>
"Now we must kill him."<br>
<p>
Yes, EXACTLY, that's the whole POINT, make it almost impossible for the<br>
government to spend money unless there's some overwhelmingly urgent cause -<br>
like an invasion - urgent enough that everyone DEMANDS to spend their own<br>
money on it.<br>
