<i>&gt;I am suggesting that when someone brings up something that </i><br>
<i>&gt;occurs for you like a matador's cape to a bull, you might want to </i><br>
<i>&gt;drill down into what's triggering the response of judging, controlling </i><br>
and flaming.<br>
<p>
Well said!  After all, are not extropians supposed to be rational.  <br>
Saying something is pseudoscience, drivel or trash without rational <br>
inquiry is simply not rational.  For those on the list whose belief <br>
systems forbid inquiry outside of fundamentalist materialism should <br>
either not respond to such posts, or start using their e-mail filtering <br>
programs.  No ones asking you to participate in such discussion.  I am <br>
sure to those of you I'm referring to know who you are.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Personally, I like the fact that this digest covers the map from the </i><br>
<i>&gt;viability of food replicators to ancient evidence of Atlantis BEING </i><br>
<i>&gt;Antarctica (that's where that thread could possibly go..).  It's </i><br>
<i>&gt;entertainment and as memes go, it's a nice distraction, sometimes a </i><br>
<i>&gt;thought-provoking one.  And of course, it doesn't take much reading </i><br>
<i>&gt;between the lines to see that my red flag is control-meisters who &gt;want </i><br>
to get the Animaniacs out of the studio lot (sorry, I have to plug those <br>
guys at least once).<br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<p>
I like the diversity of topics on this list as well.  But what I like <br>
most, is that most people who participate on this list are of high <br>
intelligence and good sport when it comes to debate.  We may be inching <br>
are way to post-humanism, but sometimes our emotions can still get the <br>
best of us.<br>
<p>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
