                          THE RAINBOW BRIDGE<br>
                          ==================<br>
<p>
                          A project to bring<br>
                        spread-spectrum systems<br>
                            down to Earth.<br>
<p>
As a microcomputer enthusiast for some years now, I remember with affection<br>
earlier, 'hobbyist' days of yore. I spent many happy days and weeks and...<br>
constructing and working with a Digital Research Computers "BIGBOARD," which<br>
was the only way I could afford to gain entrance to a magical world of CP/M.<br>
<p>
I read Jerry Pournelle's pieces in BYTE avidly, one of a few who could write<br>
good fiction (science) and technical stuff. This led me to Magic Wand, and<br>
the wonders of dBASE II (designed by Wayne Ratcliff to organize data for<br>
NASA's Viking Lander programme).<br>
<p>
My BIGBOARD came with parallel and serial port options, each with its own<br>
Zilog Z-80 dedicated chip. I soon learned the grim truth, that there was no<br>
parallel port printer driver routine to enable me to get print-outs. Autistic<br>
computers are really bad news...<br>
<p>
After weeks of exploring the black hole of Z-80 opcodes and registers,<br>
I was lucky (veery lucky) to meet up with one Geoffrey Drake, a cheerful<br>
magician who whizzed up a parallel port driver routine in an afternoon.<br>
<p>
The obviously superiority of parallel data transfers was thus imprinted<br>
in my mind. And, SERIAL PORTS COST MORE MONEY!!!<br>
<p>
In due course, David Thompson, a Hewlett-Packard technician in Portland,<br>
Oregon, started his "MICRO-CORNUCOPIA" newsletter for BIGBOARD users,<br>
and other "single-boarders." When I finally med David in Portland in 1981,<br>
it was clear that I had much to learn (still do). He and Portland are both<br>
quiet and civilized. And still, "modems are serial devices."<br>
<p>
No-one seemed to know much about byte-parallel comms. The alias of NSA used<br>
to be "NEVER SAY ANYTHING!" Hmmmmm........<br>
<p>
It was when I read James Bamford's brilliant book on the legendary<br>
"Puzzle Palace", America's National Security Agency, that I started<br>
to realize what REAL communications are all about.<br>
<p>
Imagine: messages (in any language) are encrypted, compressed, and burst-<br>
transmitted at over 20,000 times faster, at one millionth of the usual<br>
radio transmission strength, intermittently spread all over the broadcast<br>
spectrum at shifting pseudo-random intervals, buried in "deep-background"<br>
noise.<br>
<p>
The NSA somehow (!!!) manages to "vacuum-clean" these signals out of thin<br>
air, relay them to Anagram Inn, NSA's HQ in Maryland, and somehow (!!!)<br>
reassembles them, decrypts them and translates them into English, whereon<br>
they can then be passed to the Analytical Branch for the extraction of<br>
any useable intelligence.<br>
<p>
Apart from being fascinating in its own right, this started me thinking:<br>
most bright people are a bit lazy, and constantly look for ways to do<br>
things quicker, easier, better, cheaper. It was then that I realized<br>
that the NSA could INSTANTLY relay and reassemble my computer's RF<br>
emanations at any speed, in real time. And we were being asked to use<br>
300 baud acoustic modems?*!!@? to talk to each other with some difficulty!<br>
<p>
In June, 1988's BYTE, John H. Humphrey and Gary S. Smock wrote on<br>
"High-Speed Modems." On p. 104, this gem appeared:<br>
<p>
                     Multicarrier Technology<br>
<p>
"The fourth approach borrows from spread-spectrum technology used by the<br>
military in secure communications systems. This technology breaks the data<br>
into discrete pieces and spreads them across the available bandwidth on<br>
separate carrier frequencies, keyed at different time intervals. This<br>
requires the enemy to know which spreading algorithm is being used to recover<br>
the individual pieces of the communique. Without the correct algorithm, the<br>
transmissions look like random noise.<br>
<p>
"Modems using multicarrier technology spread the telephone bandwidth with<br>
hundreds of individual carrier tones, each of which is modulated quite<br>
slowly. Digital data is fed to the modem and buffered. Individual bits are<br>
fed to the multiple carriers and data is passed over the link in n-length<br>
bit-parallel fashion.<br>
<p>
The advantage of this approach is its ability to "map around" bad spots in<br>
telephone lines. If discrete portions of the telephone line are of poor<br>
quality, the modems recognize this and simply do not place carrier tones<br>
in those areas. In theory, this lets the modems operate at full speed under<br>
good line conditions and slowly fall back under poorer line conditions. The<br>
modems automatically seek and find the maximum operating speed achievable<br>
under constantly changing line conditions."<br>
<p>
(The Ven-Tel EC18K-34 is included in the review).<br>
<p>
Since then, I have learned of "public domain" discussion of a British radio-<br>
based datacomms system, called "PICCOLO," which works in much the same way.<br>
<p>
Now, sitting on the back of my ST is a parallel port, which I am told can<br>
be made bi-directional. There is also a disk-drive socket and a DMA port.<br>
Surely, I thought to myself, there must be a few bright techno-hobbyists<br>
around who could work up a neat package of hardware and software, to be<br>
sold together under the trade name "RAINBOW BRIDGE." This could be both<br>
fun, profitable, and contribute to the global liberal perestroika being<br>
brought about by the micro revolution.<br>
<p>
Please let me know if you would like to join in this venture.<br>
<p>
Kind and Gentle Regards,<br>
<p>

As far as I can see, the only difference between what you propose here and<br>
something like CIX is the supply of custom terminals to users. As custom<br>
terminals are less useful than general-purpose micros, it's only a powerful<br>
idea if you can arrange for a large percentage of the population to have<br>
these things. So, either (1) you can persuade BT to follow the example of <br>
the French or (2) you can support solutions like CIX. I think that a small-<br>
scale cix-like solution is more probable in Britain.<br>

Though the existence of Fax makes the mail side well, not useful at<br>
all....<br>
And once say ISDN is widespread, you could get access directly to<br>
online services.... finding out how to contact and use them is where<br>
Cix comes in.....<br>
<p>
You don't actually say what problem you are solving and don't resolve <br>
how you make landmail or voice phonecalls use Cix, or how you<br>
actually get someone to do the cross indexing.... <br>
<p>
I suggest you have a look at project Xanadu for the database engine<br>
of a multi-referential linked information service....<br>

I found a company in the Netherlands offers a package that does<br>
Piccolo Mk VI as an optional extra. It is hardware and software<br>
(for the PC what else ?) and costs 299 with the option.<br>
Hoka Electronics, Teiko Clockstraat 31,NL-9665 BB Oude Pekela.<br>
I don't suggest that everyone buys this as it decodes about 30<br>
other protocols, but at least we know that it exists and what to<br>
look for. Looking at the packet radio stuff it may be better to<br>
move all this to that media anyway. Who wants to get their class<br>
B RAE in november then ?<br>
