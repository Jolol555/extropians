In a message dated 97-07-14 08:10:11 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; t would be interesting to see if the process of becoming oneself<br>
 could be aided by artificial means; so far it has been largely a<br>
 random accumulation of experience and a gradual abstraction from<br>
 them. Schooling is one method intended to make this process a bit<br>
 more efficient, maybe some initiation rites could be considered<br>
 growth tools too. Are there others reliable methods?<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I read lots of SF...in one of the last books that I've been able to acquire<br>
"The Reality Dysfunction"...this point is mentioned.  Also David Weber speaks<br>
to the matter in his series dealing with the Genocidal Alein Horde  (can't<br>
recollect the titles just now) ..he uses the terms "implants" and "enhanced"<br>
a lot i seem to recall.<br>
<p>
Also in "Vacumn Flowers" (forget the author)..there is the concept of an<br>
entire personality being overlaid upon ones own...to the point that they are<br>
available in stores...today you can be Barbie,...tomorrow Madonna....(or<br>
whatever)<br>
<p>
I mention the above...science fiction ...to illustrate that the idea has been<br>
considered...by creative..if not inventive...people.<br>
<p>
So let me hypothesize:<br>
<p>
    The "Mind" is a multitude of "programs" running (simultaneously and<br>
sequentially) upon a (currently) biological (protein colloid) "computer".<br>
 These programs, in aggregate, constitute a person's personality, memory,<br>
knowledge and skills (i.e. the programming needed to move the muscles)..and<br>
more.<br>
<p>
I beleive it is conceded that "uploading" is foreseeable.  If in the process<br>
of uploading the original is not destroyed then might partial uploads be<br>
possible?  Might not future products....ready for upload at need....be<br>
languages...organizational skills...mathematics....etc...<br>
