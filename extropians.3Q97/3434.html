Have you ever read Foucault's _Discipline and Punish_? Sounds like you<br>
might find it interesting. In short, Foucault demonstrates the<br>
development of Western hierarchical systems (i.e., prisons, law<br>
enforcement, bureuacracy and government) and the corresponding growth of<br>
society as a disciplinary entity. From prisons (Jeremy Bentham's<br>
Panopticon, in particular), Foucault suggests a common bond between<br>
schools, factories, barracks and hospitals, organized institutions which<br>
allow the control of an individual's time and space hour by hour. People<br>
become used to this "discipline" and thus, begin to discipline<br>
themselves -- morality, vigilantism, etc. Those of you familiar with<br>
Oliver Stone's _Full Metal Jacket_ understand what Foucault is getting<br>
at. Remember the scene where the recruits load up their pillowcases with<br>
bars of soap and then kick the shit out of Private Pyle because he's not<br>
"up to standard." The consequence of daily discipline is a collective in<br>
which discipline becomes internalized. The end result is a society of<br>
individuals which disciplines itself. Such a society is easily governed,<br>
and in extreme cases, self-governing.<br>
<p>
There's much, much more. I recommend the book to critical thinkers.<br>
