     Hi,<br>
     <br>
     I went through all of my e-mail lists and made sure I connected with <br>
     as many of my online friends as possible.  As of 10/1, I will no <br>
     longer be at Platinum.  It's kind of miraculous really.  My life is <br>
     changing for the better, I can definitely feel it.  It's exciting and <br>
     scary all at the same time, kind of like how you feel when you get on <br>
     a real scary rollercoaster or try repelling off a cliff for the first <br>
     time (I've actually only done that ONCE due to my acrophobia).<br>
     <br>
     In the meantime, if you are wanting to get in touch with me by e-mail, <br>
     use my partner's account: tco@creative.net and I'll soon have my own <br>
     personal mailbox again and will give all of you a heads up.<br>
     <br>
     You can reach me by phone at 415/821-3459.  I can be reached at work <br>
     through Tuesday, September 30 at 650/594-8628 and at this e-mail <br>
     address until then as well.<br>
     <br>
     My snail-mail address is still <br>
     <br>
     320 Eureka St. #A'<br>
     San Francisco, CA  94114<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     HAL:  What's going to happen Dave?<br>
     DAVE: Something wonderful!<br>
