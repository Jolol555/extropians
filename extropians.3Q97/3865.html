It's exciting to imagine the possibilities that arise even today from<br>
such a large mass of distributed compute servers.  It looks to me like<br>
Bovine's group has implemented a distributed computing architecture of<br>
high quality and resilience (although I have yet to see their code).<br>
They've made it almost effortless to donate cycles--I logged into a<br>
sparc ultra today and in 60 seconds with no prior experience had its cpu<br>
load up to 100% running their client. Not bad...<br>
<p>
Although they have made clients available for many popular platforms,<br>
I'd like to see a Java applet client, allowing anyone with a web browser<br>
to just load up a page to start donating cycles. Of course having a jvm<br>
doing the compute-intensive operations is pretty slow but it's possible<br>
to write native methods that would speed things up quite a bit.  And<br>
until you get around to writing them for all the different architectures<br>
it will at least work slowly but correctly.  At least the GUI/networking<br>
code can be written once and reused everywhere.<br>
<p>
But forget about the RC5 project and the paltry "reward" they're<br>
offering--what else can be done with a million pentium-class machines<br>
all offering lots of free cycles to the world?  Abstract away the<br>
rc5-cracking-specific code from their client and allow it to run any<br>
module of compute-intensive code that applies to a problem at hand. <br>
What kind of distributed neural network simulations can be built on top<br>
of it?  Or does the bandwidth become a limiting factor that would make<br>
it impossible/pointless to run in real time?<br>
<p>
Maybe compute cycles will become a unit of currency...<br>
<p>

<p>
Yeah, I think that's just running in the background as another thread.<br>
It's 4am...do you know what your CPU is doing?<br>
