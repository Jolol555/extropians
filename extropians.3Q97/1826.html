     Referencing "Men and Marriage" by George Gilder, a not unrespected <br>
     writer, he indicates that no Matriarchial Society has been successful <br>
     due to terrorism by gangs of teenage boys...He cites present day <br>
     Ghetto Blacks as an example...among many examples...<br>
     <br>
     The cause of this appears to be deeply rooted.<br>
     <br>
     Rick responds:<br>
     <br>
     "not unrespected"? Is that like respected or almost respected? &lt;G&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

     So it's those nasty teenage boys (glad I had a girl...most of the <br>
     time) who are the impetus for all this eh?  I can see where that holds <br>
     true in Inner City situations.  But does not poverty factor in and <br>
     undermine matriarchal influence?  Poverty tends to numb one to the <br>
     hardships of day-to-day living.  That disempowerment of the women due <br>
     to poverty (particularly in regards to an ostensibly disempowered <br>
     cultural set due to racial inequality) could very well just open the <br>
     space for rampant teenage mayhem.<br>
<p>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>

{It's been some time since I read the book...but it impressed me a<br>
lot...let's see if I can recall some pertinent points.  It IS nasty teenage<br>
boys...."Every culture is only one generation away from Barbarism...and every<br>
culture must deal with the onslaught of barbarians...their young"<br>
<p>
And poverty has nothing to do with it.  The blacks HAD a culture prior to the<br>
governments meddling thanks to LBJ during the sixties...said meddling pretty<br>
much destroyed it...this according to Ken Hamblin...Walter Williams...Thomas<br>
Sowell (or at least my understanding of what they said...and they are all<br>
blacks) and my understanding of George Gilder.....and personal observation.<br>
<p>
Teen age boys are ruled by their Hormones...and girls control the floodgates.<br>
 Many societies/cultures have methods of sublimating  and controlling the<br>
desires and impulses generated by the hormonal flood...in West Texas where I<br>
am from it was in a large part FOOTBALL....and other sports...to a much<br>
lesser degree....the boys vented much of their anger/frusturation/excess<br>
energy etc...trying to be a football hero and hence get the girls to pay<br>
attention to him....it pretty much worked for a fair percentage of the<br>
suceptible teenage male population....<br>
<p>
This discouraged gangs...another...more primitive (natural...but socially<br>
destructive) method of hormonal storm control...<br>
<p>
In either case the girls were in control.  They could say NO.  The longer the<br>
DID say no the better things worked out....In black Ghettos (and brown, and<br>
white, and yellow and ...I suppose...red)...the girls DON'T say no....hence<br>
there is no control over the boys...the fathers being displaced by government<br>
welfare.<br>
<p>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
------------------------------------------    <br>
     Are there any examples where survival issues aren't weighing heavily <br>
     on the scenario so that teenage boys don't just "revert to type" (now <br>
     THAT'S a generalization! Woo-doggie!)?  Sorry, teenage boys tended to <br>
     make this former wimp's growing up life rather hellish at times &lt;G&gt;.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Mine too...I was &lt;am&gt; a loner...didn't fit in very well in team sports at<br>
ALL...but I faked it...size helped...plus the ability to take a beating...too<br>
stupid to just fall down when I was beat to a pulp..which is what I SHOULD<br>
have done when I took on that Golden Gloves contender in high school...but<br>
NOOOO....(funny...they pretty much left me alone after that...)<br>
<p>
Gilder references Margaret Meads work...it seems she studied primitive<br>
cultures some of which were Matriarchial...and were terrorized by teen age<br>
gangs.  <br>
