<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;The pace of change is not a problem to be solved. It is a fact of life</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;that human beings should synergize with.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; You cannot justify your statement about the nature of the pace of change</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; simply by saying it a fact of life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Huh? I wasn't justifying anything.</i><br>
<p>
That's my point. The latter sentence appears to be readable as both a<br>
corollary and explanation of the former sentence. But, whether or not that<br>
is your intention, these statements lack justification, and that's not<br>
something that sits well on this list: people tend to like 'I think...' to<br>
be followed by 'because...'<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Cancer is a fact of life. Death is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; fact of life. Bigotry is a fact of life. They are all problems and I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; believe they all need to be solved. I'm not necessarily disagreeing with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; you, just asking you for a cogent argument.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you don't disagree then you don't need any argument, cogent or not.</i><br>
<p>
I didn't say that I agreed or disagreed: I'm trying to decide whether or<br>
not I agree, and it would help me in doing that to know the reasoning<br>
behind your statement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyway, sorry for being pedantic. </i><br>
<p>
Don't be, it is oftn the essence of good argument :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The problems you cite are indeed problems. They are also facts of life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The pace of change is not a problem, but it is a fact of life. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I must be missing your point because if you don't disagree then what are</i><br>
<i>&gt;you doing?</i><br>
<p>
See above. You have not convinced me that the pace of change is not a problem.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;I say speed them up so I can augment my inefficent physical form with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;something more capable.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; It seems a little naive to assume that increases in the pace of change, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; even continued change should allow you to do anything at all about your</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; form. Will you be able to afford it? Will you have access to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; technology? Will you even hear of the developments?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ancillary questions, don't you think?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Whether I can opt for augmentation or not is irrelevant to the question</i><br>
<i>&gt;of whether augmentation is available, no? If the pace of change is</i><br>
<i>&gt;slowed, then I might not have even the option, never mind how much it</i><br>
<i>&gt;costs.</i><br>
<p>
No, not ancillary in the slightest. Indeed, since your standpoint is that<br>
such developments are inevitable, your access to them should be your<br>
_primary_ question.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;You are insignificant. So am I.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; This is not a very Extropian attitude.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I nearly became sarcastic. I wonder why you think so? Oh, wait, here's</i><br>
<i>&gt;the reason:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; We may not be owed anything by</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; anyone but that does not have the corollary of insignificance. And if we</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; truly desire change, insignificant is one thing we cannot _afford_ to be,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; either as individuals or as a group.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This doesn't tell me anything about whether we are insignificant or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Whether I can afford to be insignificant in the face of the universe is</i><br>
<i>&gt;not the question I was addressing. If I am significant, then express</i><br>
<i>&gt;that. </i><br>
<p>
I'm not trying to tell you whether or not you are significant now. What I<br>
am saying is that, if we are insignificant, we cannot afford to remain so,<br>
Your phrasing had rather fatalistic overtones, which conveyed a feeling<br>
that we are insignificant and that's that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The tools for my survival are on their way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; To people with money, and friends in high places, and influence, of whom</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; you and I have probably never heard. Unless we do something to involve</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ourselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The tools for *MY* survival are on their way. I didn't include anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;but me. </i><br>
<p>
Are they? It would be in the spirit of the list if you told us what they<br>
were, how they operate and how you propose to obtain them. Actually,<br>
perhaps this is a sterling test for the disposition of Extropians. Is it<br>
every person for him/herself, or will we share our knowledge even in the<br>
face of potential competition?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;No one has any better chance than any other. All your</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;money, all your resources may be rendered worthless at the Singularity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Hmmm. 'And He shall judge them one and all at the great Singularity, when</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; all shall be equal.' Om.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well said.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Notice my use of the construction "may be".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are you arguing with me, or just being clever?</i><br>
<p>
Well, I would hope both. Perhaps I missed the subtlety of 'may be'; it just<br>
seemed that your were undermining your own statements with a final, "In the<br>
end it doesn't matter what we do, because the singularity is going to 'get<br>
us all'."<br>
