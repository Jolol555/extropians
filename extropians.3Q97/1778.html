<i>&gt; From: EvMick@aol.com</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  When i get to be old and smart enough, I will incorporate my uploaded</i><br>
mind<br>
<i>&gt;  into the fabric of a galaxy. So far so good. I think that wil be room</i><br>
<i>&gt;  enough for my taste.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The problem is though... where do I keep the backup?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But what do you mean by "incorporate my uploaded mind into the fabric</i><br>
of...."<br>
<p>
Well the people i have seen die of old age, havn't seem to be that worried<br>
about it. They felt they had experienced everything. Their life was a bore,<br>
and their friends had died. I guess if i'm uploaded and my brain is running<br>
a million times faster, and im so smart that problems that now seems<br>
difficult will be trivial, that there might someday come a time when i feel<br>
that there won't be more to experience. (I'm certainly not shure, but it<br>
could happen.)<br>
<p>
Then, just to get the final kick, i would somehow make my uploaded mind a<br>
part of the universe. Perhaps incorporate it into a galaxy. (Don't ask me<br>
how, i'm just not smart enough yet, but i'm shure theres a way.) It would<br>
be big and it would be slow. But that's just the point.<br>
<p>
The end of the universe (If there is an end) would happen in realtime, over<br>
the course of what seems like a week in subjective time or something like<br>
that.<br>
<p>
Would be a nice way to go. :-)<br>
