<p>
Exsqueeze me? Since when have South Africa and Israel had<br>
unrestricted immigration for all comers (which is what John K<br>
Clark's post was about)?<br>
<p>
It seems to me that the only example of unrestricted<br>
immigration for all comers was the United States of America<br>
before the Chinese Exclusion acts (and the later total<br>
regulation of immigration in the 1920s).  I don't know about<br>
you, maybe it's just a trace of Yankee chauvinism in me, but<br>
I'm rather pleased with the results of *that* experiment in<br>
unrestricted immigration for all comers.  I mean, compared to<br>
the alternatives.<br>
<p>
You "Caucasians" must be really smart if you think that South<br>
Africa and Israel have unrestricted immigration for all comers.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; The problem is others (less "fortunate" than yourself) coming to</i><br>
<i> &gt; *you*. If immigration really was totally free, all successful places</i><br>
<i> &gt; would be overrun even faster by masses of poor immigrants (in your</i><br>
<i> &gt; case wave upon wave of Mexicans, I guess).</i><br>
<p>
Again, I suppose that the nineteenth-century USA proves your<br>
point for you.  For over a hundred years, the immigrants just<br>
rolled in, with no regulation whatsoever, and the country just<br>
kept getting poorer, and poorer, and poorer... (Um, wait,<br>
that's not exactly what happened, was it?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From trying to follow the "logic" behind some of your extrapolative</i><br>
scenarios, it seems to me that you could stand a dose of microeconomics<br>
and price theory.  You might want to look into a little thingy<br>
known as the Principle of Comparative Advantage.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; The "private protection agencies" will probably evolve into *states*,</i><br>
<i> &gt; with their own "turf" (country), "protection money" (taxes) etc.</i><br>
<i> &gt; The correlation between what you pay and what you get will eventually</i><br>
<i> &gt; fade, and you might end up with a truly medieval "city state"</i><br>
<i> &gt; scenario, with bands of thugs roaming the countryside, despotic</i><br>
<i> &gt; rulers, lots of small wars...the works.  Hardly an improvement,</i><br>
<i> &gt; I'd say.</i><br>
<p>
Um, mechanism please?  How will insurance premiums evolve into<br>
taxes?  How will turf-monopolists exclude competition without<br>
annoying (and losing) their customers, and thereby losing their<br>
revenue base?  I hope you can come up with something better<br>
than Nozick's goofy scenario from ANARCHY, STATE, AND UTOPIA.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; &gt;         &gt;"We" are the Caucasians (oh, it's that ugly word again)</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; No not ugly, just rather quaint and old-fashioned, a phrase past </i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; its expiration date, like "moving pictures" or "horse-less </i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; carriage" or "phlogiston" or "luminiferous ether". </i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Any ideas for a replacement?              </i><br>
<p>
"Caloric" needed no replacement, because it meant something other<br>
than thermic energy; it "referred" to an illusory fluid that doesn't<br>
actually exist. Probably "Caucasian" needs no replacement, either,<br>
but if you really want one, it's probably more honest to speak of<br>
palefaces, or more colloquially and metaphorically, of white people.<br>
Of course, "Caucasian" includes all Arabs and most of the people<br>
in the Indian subcontinent... is it your intent to include these<br>
people in your referent, or is this just an embarrassment of early<br>
twentieth century physical anthropological usage to you?  I have<br>
to guess the latter, since you reserve much of your venom for<br>
Muslims, who are mostly Caucasian according to the traditional<br>
usage of that word.<br>
