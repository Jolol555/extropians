I think there is something that should be pointed out clearly here. <br>
What you seem to mean is that  genetic algorithms will play an <br>
important role in designing the immune system. However, what you <br>
often say is that *evolution* will do that. Now, that is not wrong, <br>
but I might mislead some people. Although genetic algorithms can be <br>
said to describe some form of evolution, there is a world of a <br>
difference between natural, blind, Darwinian evolution and specially <br>
designed genetic algorithms that can be Darwinian or Laplacian with <br>
any number of sexes and variable sizes of the property chunks that <br>
are inherited, where all the parameters can be played with by an <br>
insightful experimenter who a guids the process with his knowledge <br>
and overseeing intelligence. These are two separate things, but many <br>
people tend to confuse them.<br>
<p>
evolutionaly computing: designed &amp; controlled<br>
(natural) evolution: blind &amp; controlling<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Design is good at jumping over deserts in the fitness landscape,</i><br>
<i>&gt; while evolution is good at searching it</i><br>
<p>
This would seem to lead to the prediction that the more that is known <br>
the less useful will evolutionary computing be. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; a certain overhead, but it is an overhead for your immune-computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; not for your design capabilities.</i><br>
<p>
What do you mean? My desigen capabilities depend on the <br>
design-programs I run. Since the designs in question are designs for <br>
immune-defence systems, they would run on the "immune-computer". <br>
Hence any overhead for the immune-computer is an overhead for my <br>
design capabilities.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As an example, assume the worst scenario happens and an escaped badly</i><br>
<i>&gt; programmed dishwashing nanite</i><br>
<p>
This does not seem to be the worst scenario to me. The worst <br>
scenario would be something deliberately built to eliminate all <br>
life. (It would be even worse if it was designed to torture it.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;starts to turn all organic life</i><br>
<p>
Why just organic life? Why not dead organic substances, earth, etc. <br>
And is there any good reason why it could not change the earth crust <br>
into something with a higher binding energy?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; into</i><br>
<i>&gt; more of itself. It will spread with the speed of an bacterial</i><br>
<i>&gt; infection, and be quite deadly.</i><br>
<p>
Why couldn't it spread much faster? Bacteria are limited to some <br>
specifid kinds of hosts, the nanites could attack any organic <br>
material and many inorganic ones too.And if they were deliberately <br>
designed, they could transform themself to missiles after they had <br>
eaten enough, and then swoosh accross the seven sees in a very short <br>
time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Of course, as soon as this becomes</i><br>
<i>&gt; known there will be several groups who quickly enclose themselves in</i><br>
<i>&gt; their already built underground bases (Cheyenne mountain is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; example that exists today, and with this level of nanotech I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; there will be more "nanosurvivalists" waiting for the disaster).</i><br>
<p>
They might have to go there pretty quickly, like after a nuclear <br>
alert. They will have to make sure that not a single little nanite <br>
finds a way in. They will have to hope that the nanite doesn't eat <br>
rocks and cement. They will have a limited time to figure out how to <br>
use their very limited resources to eliminate a enemy that already <br>
forms a think deadly layer over the whole earth. They have to hope <br>
that the nanites weren't deliberately designed to pile up explosives <br>
on top of their bunker and blow it all away. --Yes, they *could* make <br>
it, at least in a Hollywood movie...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So</i><br>
<i>&gt; while the biosphere turns to dishwashing goo there will be people</i><br>
<i>&gt; around who are very motivated to find a weapon against it, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; example a tailored "predator nanite" or something similar. It doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; appear likely that the goo could wipe out all the people (just a very</i><br>
<i>&gt; large amount of them)</i><br>
<p>
I'm sorry, but it does seem to me a bit like wishful thinking (and <br>
reading to much SF?). I think I will call this the <br>
go-hide-in-your-basement solution to the antiproliferation problem.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;, and then it would just evolve in an ordinary</i><br>
<i>&gt; way</i><br>
<p>
(Unless it was designed not to evolve.)<br>
<p>
The remarks you made seem predicated on the assumption that the <br>
nanites will be comparable to a particularly virulent biological <br>
plague. Suppose that this isn't true. Then the only method for <br>
avoiding disaster in a society where there are many independet <br>
individuals with full technological access is to have some kind of <br>
active nanotech immune system. It seems to me that the reactions <br>
towards higher binding energy would always have an advantage, so in <br>
this situation there would only be two ways of maintaing status quo.<br>
<p>
The first is if all the material were already very close to its <br>
lowest energy state, so that no more reactions were economical. Does <br>
anyone have a good design for a computer that would work under those <br>
circumstances (we would all be uploads then).<br>
<p>
The second is to have the immune system quickly eliminating any <br>
plagues, and it could use the fact that it has access to more energy. <br>
A good design for this?<br>
<p>
Aha, I just thought of a third way. The independent folks could all <br>
live in a virtual reality that were designed so they could do no <br>
major harm. They would have no access to the real reality, which <br>
would be ruled by a single entity.<br>
