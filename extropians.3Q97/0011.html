I don't know if you're reading this, but it seems I have a problem -<br>
Sometimes I recieve replies to posts I haven't seen, then they'll either<br>
arrive several days later or never at all.  Sometimes I send something to the<br>
list and it will not turn up, but I'll get replies anyway, sometimes it wont<br>
turn up and i'll get no replies.  So where did all the mail go?<br>
<p>
Is it me? Is it you? Is it AOL? (it probably is)<br>
