Indeed, a friend's dictionary also pointed that out yesterday evening. We<br>
had someone from Oracle, from Informix, and from Verity sitting at the<br>
table.  I have high hopes that our term will crop up in some marketing<br>
documents soon...<br>

Even better, if you go to <a href="http://www.eb.com:180/hapax/index.htm">http://www.eb.com:180/hapax/index.htm</a> (after<br>
you've gone to the trouble of signing up for trial membership to<br>
Encyclopedia Brittanica), you can play Hapax Legomena the GAME.  I've been<br>
getting chills about running into this phrase twice in one day.  I love it.  <br>
<p>
Do you think E.B. has given up on innovative forms of information retrieval<br>
technology and are trying to train up the new generation of searchers?<br>

Doing my part to spread this meme far and wide,<br>
