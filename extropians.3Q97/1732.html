Day One.<br>
<p>
Of course, if you're a transhumanist extropian, you can't attend a<br>
conference where K. Eric Drexler is the after-dinner speaker, and leave not<br>
feeling that his presence was the reason for yours. But list subscribers<br>
might already know that.<br>
<p>
For me, the surprises lay elsewhere in the proceedings. The conference<br>
seems to me a monumental achievement for the Extropy Institute. That so<br>
many radically conservative thinkers could be assembled into such a small<br>
space all at the same time is a most pleasing opportunity to those of us<br>
who have our minds open to the future.<br>
<p>
Anders Sandberg has made an indelible impression on my memory with his talk<br>
covering techniques to improve recall and the process of thought. What a<br>
character. I always loved his virtual personality, but the real fellow is<br>
even more fun. I do hope we get a chance to talk over breakfast tomorrow.<br>
Picture in your mind the Swedish chef from The Muppet Show, replace the<br>
chicken with a presentation pointer, make him sixty years old, add a<br>
generous helping of computational neuroscience, some white hair, some thick<br>
glasses and, even though Anders' hair isn't actually white yet and he's in<br>
his mid-twenties, you will know what Anders is about. It's an avatar that<br>
works well for me, and I hang on his words.<br>
<p>
I did find the inclusion of a debate on the future of gender quite bizarre.<br>
I fail to see that gender has any long-term future, a view I did not change<br>
today. It was pleasing, though, to hear Christopher Heward, Ph.D., (an<br>
endocrinologist) announce quite publicly his down-to-earth disagreement<br>
with the widespread, educated thinking on what gender is all about. His<br>
views on the subject clearly come from his groin, and what better place?<br>
This is social interaction in today's real world of testosterone, not that<br>
mysterious plane of "enlightenment" where one can cite study after study on<br>
why there are umpteen different variations on gender and sexuality, despite<br>
what can plainly be seen and emotionally felt when one looks between one's<br>
legs. Of the panelists, only Natasha actually commented on the FUTURE of<br>
anything. But despite the expectations one might have had from the title to<br>
the contrary, nobody actually discussed the future of GENDER. I still<br>
couldn't grasp just what, in a posthuman world, I would need gender for. I<br>
had some sympathy with Kathryn Aegis, whose widely heard yet silent<br>
statement was the loudest of all contributions. (She wasn't there.)<br>
<p>
Stephen Coles, M.D., Ph.D., started out very promisingly, warning so loudly<br>
that one should be cautious when listening to charlatans. One must not<br>
accept medical advice from someone who cannot back it up with a reference<br>
to sound research, he said. He then gave some medical advice, and, only<br>
when questioned, admitted that there was no research to back up the advice<br>
whatsoever. So, before all men go cutting iron from their diets, I suggest<br>
first adding a pinch of sodium and chloride.<br>
<p>
The cryonicists appear finally to have recruited Dr. Drexler, not only as a<br>
subscriber but also as a salesman. I'm familiar with the "you die / you die<br>
/ you die / you don't" matrix, which must have persuaded at least a few to<br>
part with their hard-earned cash, but I'm still surprised that I don't hear<br>
anyone quizzing whether they could extend their lives more assuredly by,<br>
say, buying additional safety features in their home and car. The day has<br>
not YET come for ME when I believe that for a given amount of money, the<br>
period of extension multiplied by the probablity it will work is greater<br>
for cryonics than for buying better food and taking more excercise. If I<br>
spend the money on cryonics today instead of on time off work to excercise,<br>
then maybe I will "die" so soon that the freezing technology won't do a<br>
good enough job. Afford the excercise, goes the theory, and I'll make it as<br>
far as the five star freezer. <br>
<p>
Greg Stock, by contrast, was fascinating. His demonstration of the<br>
ludicrousness of popular opinion on germline genetic engineering was, for<br>
me at least, thoroughly convincing. He reported that, asked whether they<br>
would genetically modify their offspring to enhance functionality, Thailand<br>
had a majority positive response, whilst the U.S. was seriously<br>
unsupportive of the idea. I couldn't help but wonder whether the dominant<br>
variation inter eastern and western religions was at the root. His report<br>
that major in-vivo modification was "much more difficult" than ex-vivo and<br>
germline engineering was disappointing. Like the Americans, I won't be<br>
modifying my children. But I WOULD like to modify myself.<br>
<p>
And the ever-present Max has managed to transform me at once from a<br>
relatively static entity into a continually changing process which actively<br>
seeks criticism in order to develop more rapidly. Thanks, Max, and, er,<br>
wood shavings to you, too.<br>
<p>
So far, a nice trip to California for a salesman from England.<br>
