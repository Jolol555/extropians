Well, that depends on the scale. Their thinking could just as well<br>
exist on different timescales, with quick subminds being isolated<br>
from each other, seeing each other as individuals, and higher level<br>
slower subminds gradually merging. <br>

True, although it will take a long time (many millions of years, at<br>
least), judging by Dyson's calculations. <br>
<p>

Sounds reasonable, beautiful and tricky (but feasible!) to design.<br>
Note that you will have to take GR into account for the orbits;<br>
making them interlace is a very nontrivial problem. Basically the<br>
gravitational field ar radius r will be the black hole + all beads at<br>
lesser radii, which creates a potential on the form<br>
<p>
P(r)= -g Mb / r        r&lt;ri<br>
P(r)= -g(Mb / r + (Ms / (ro - ri))(1 - ri/r)))    ri &lt; r &lt; ro<br>
P(r)= -g(Mb + Ms) / r   r&gt;ro<br>
<p>
(if you calculate classically, which you can't do here :-), where Mb<br>
is the black hole mass, Ms the shell mass, ro the outer radius and ri<br>
the inner radius of the shell. I haven't taken different densities at<br>
different radii into account. <br>
<p>
Hmm, this looks odd. There is a dip in the potential inside the<br>
shell. This suggests that self-gravity might be a big problem if the<br>
shell is massive (the classic dyson sphere is not massive compared to<br>
the central star). This dip might make orbits much trickier to<br>
design, although a fun possibility is having a shell of equal mass to<br>
the black hole orbiting between radii r=1 and r=2, g=1; it creates a<br>
flat potential there - no tidal forces! Of course, I could have made<br>
a simple mistake (and never trust a classical calculation!).<br>
