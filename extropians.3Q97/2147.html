Monetarism is a "kinda" failure.  It had two big conclusions:<br>
<p>
1) Playing with the inflation rate cannot improve the long-term function of<br>
the economy, only mess it up.<br>
<p>
This has basically turned out turn, although there still is some work that<br>
indicates a little (less than 3%) inflation may help.<br>
<p>
2) The inflation rate is determined by the size of the money supply.<br>
<p>
This has turned out to be true only when the financial markets don't innovate<br>
and are fairly restrictive.  It used to work passably well, but is a major<br>
bust today, due to deregulation and computers.  <br>
<p>
Right now the major central banks achieve monetarist goals with<br>
non-monetarist means. The current state of the money markets in<br>
industrialized countries seems to validate their approach.<br>
