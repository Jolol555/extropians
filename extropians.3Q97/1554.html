Indeed, if one shears the hair of a chimpanzee or an orangutan, <br>
having "white" skin, leaving just the head's (and other...) they will <br>
seem with lots of "white" humans... (skin funny..) <br>
As someone said before, the main problem is really the cultural <br>
rascism, because of the observed cultural differences between <br>
humans:  In one side, those with higher level, do not try to get <br>
"nearer" the lower ones. In the other side, the lower levels make it <br>
 very difficult when someones uncounsciously tries to <br>
reflect his characteristics  through them, the superficial feedback <br>
is sometimes not so good... (as a "similis similia" effect) They are <br>
in general not educated enough and, consequently, sometimes seems not <br>
so pleasant to live together... (for example, the first time <br>
we hear a "rap"... I do not bear more than 1 or two minutes...even <br>
country music is better - joking..) Anyway, these are pure <br>
observations on what happens, but, since we are in the side of those <br>
who can really change the things, I suppose the better way is, <br>
parallelly, provide or contribute to the necessary cultural evolution <br>
of the so-called "lower cultural level people". I said parallelly, <br>
because, I even think that it will  be necessary a separation of the <br>
Homo cyber from the Homo sapiens, so the first can really evolute. <br>
And it is no way a case of rascism, cause the spectum of people <br>
intelectually dummy enough for perturbing the evolution of mankind is <br>
independent of colour, money, and.. "psedo-culture..." (sometimes <br>
very misused...)  <br>
