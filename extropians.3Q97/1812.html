SPIKE, as `Pelagius') wrote:<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;Unfortunately the book has not yet been published in less advanced parts of</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;the Australian publisher I hope he lets us know.</i><br>
<p>
and Patrick Wilken added:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'd also be interested where I could pickup a copy here in Oz. Is it</i><br>
<i>&gt;available from all the main bookstores?</i><br>
<p>
I *hope* it's generally available now in bookstores throughout Australia,<br>
because I've been wearing my throat down to a croak with media interviews.<br>
To my delight, most of my interrogators have expressed fascination (plus<br>
the mandatory shivers of terror) at the prospects of radical change as we<br>
approach a Singularity.  <br>
<p>
There have been the odd deplorable exceptions (I mean, ya gotta laff, ya<br>
really gotta laff):<br>
<p>
After I'd explained to one Perth radio interviewer that during the next 50<br>
years the whole of the economy will be destroyed and remade by<br>
nanotechnology, obliterating work as we know it, that the body would be<br>
rewired and retrofitted by genetic engineering, and that the brain would be<br>
augmented by artificial intelligence adjuncts smarter than humans, she<br>
remarked thoughtfully, heading straight for the key issue:  <br>
<p>
`Hmm.  And Damien, tell me, what will people be wearing in 2050?'  <br>
<p>
`Silver lycra unisex jumpsuits, you imbecile, surely everyone knows that,'<br>
I didn't say.<br>
<p>
Eliezer (and thanks for the nice comments, Eli, glimpsed through the<br>
thorns) was worried by my stylistic method:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Broderick doesn't harp on hubris the way Ed</i><br>
<i>&gt;Regis does, but his occasional courtesies to his predecessor still get on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;nerves.  It's even worse because I know perfectly well that Broderick isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;shocked by any of this; he's been on this list long enough to lose it. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Delight in the new, or occasional horror, yes.  But shock?  You can't make me</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe it.  Broderick isn't a technophobe, and I'd wish he'd stop trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt;pretend he was.</i><br>
<p>
I'm charmed by the idea that I might now have been reading extropian and<br>
transhumanist posts long enough to have settled down out of my instinctive<br>
terror of, like, you know, *really scary futuristic ideas*.  I suppose I<br>
need to point out, for the record, that I've been making my living writing<br>
about extreme technologies since... well, since Eliezer was minus 17 years<br>
old.<br>
<p>
That biographical detail aside, it's true that I've chosen in this<br>
non-specialist book to adopt something of Ed Regis's faux-shocked tone in<br>
easing into some of these topics.  It's my experience that while this can<br>
grate on us old troupers/troopers, it's just what the doctor ordered for<br>
the many readers (the thousands and millions of them out there) who start<br>
off wanting to know... what kinds of fashions we'll be wearing in 2050.<br>
<p>
THE SPIKE can be bought by email (from anywhere in the world I assume) from<br>
Dymocks at<br>
<p>

<p>
But note that some genius has entered my name in their files as BRODERICK,<br>
DAMIE, leaving off the terminal N.  (No wonder I'm so anal-retentive about<br>
spelling mistakes!)  So until they fix it that's the name you need to enter<br>
to find me - or maybe just key in SPIKE.  They also provide such unreliable<br>
factoids as listing my recent discourse-theory book about science and the<br>
humanities, THE ARCHITECTURE OF BABEL, as `science fiction &amp; fantasy' - not<br>
true, or it would have sold about 100 times as any copies...  :(<br>
<p>
I hope you-all enjoy the book, and that it *gets out there* in a big way.<br>
