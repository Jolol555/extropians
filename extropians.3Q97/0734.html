I have a hunch that if you come to a thorough understanding of this phenomenon<br>
you will understand why your "Lorrey Drive" will not work.  I initiated a<br>
thread on sci.physics last week about another momentum-conservation-violating<br>
"space drive" which you had referred to a while back, and which is available<br>
at the online IBM patent server.  It would be helpful for you to attempt to<br>
understand why that device will not work, either.<br>
<p>
The point you are missing is the existence of Coriolis forces when a mass<br>
moves in a rotating reference frame; and further, that a "pivot point" can<br>
experience forces in other than the radial direction.  In the case of the<br>
swing, the pivot point where the swing is attached is itself pushed back and<br>
forth, but being attached firmly to the Earth the motion is not noticeable.<br>
<p>
Consider in particular the case where you are crouched in a swing, moving from<br>
left to right, and you suddenly stand up as the swing goes through the vertical<br>
position.  By conservation of angular momentum, you can see that your horizontal<br>
velocity will increase.  But by conservation of linear momentum, some other<br>
object must increase its velocity to the left to counter your increased<br>
momentum to the right.  That object is the Earth, and the pivot point will feel<br>
a force to the left as you stand.<br>
