I've had debates of this kind with other anthropologists in the department<br>
where I'm studying. There are, actually, a lot of studies anout these other<br>
cultures, some very detailed and wide-ranging. Ethnographic study finds<br>
itself in a double bind. If an ethnography attempts to represent another<br>
culture through reference only to the concepts existing within that culture<br>
itself, then the ethnography's audience (usually Western scholars) will not<br>
be able to relate to the information presented. Hence ethnographers are<br>
forced to produce interpretations which are, ex necessite, founded in<br>
Western ethnocentric concepts. At the end of the day there is a delicate<br>
balance to be struck between the as-objective-as-possible relating of the<br>
daily occurences within a society, and the necessarily subjective and<br>
culturally-relative interpretations and glosses (some would say cultural<br>
'translations') placed on those occurences. (I'm currently looking at<br>
ethnographies dealing with witchcraft, which show the differing balances<br>
placed on these two aspects by different ethnographers.)<br>
