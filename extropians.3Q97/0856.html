It's been done.  Blorp, blorp, blorp.  We're the only ape with any native<br>

Crocodiles are a major obstacles, but perhaps not insurmountable if the<br>
aquatic phase was relatively late and they had spears.  In any case, there's<br>
always the seashore.  Something with hands and rocks almost has a ready-made<br>
niche with shellfish there.  I would think transient lakes in the Sahara (one<br>
that shows up for a few thousand years under appropriate climactic<br>
conditions) might also be free of crocodiles.  (anybody here know?)<br>
<p>
Unfortunately even if we could be sure of, say, a coastal origin, the coast<br>
of  Africa is still a fairly big place.  Worse, sea level has varied a lot<br>
too; so the target area would be thousands of miles long by a hundred wide.<br>
 Rather big.  Even if we narrow it down to East Africa it's *still* big.<br>
