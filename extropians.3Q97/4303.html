A THANK YOU TO RICHARD PLOURDE<br>
------------------------------<br>
<p>
I appreciate all the time you've spent on this so far.<br>
It's already been of considerable benefit to me.<br>
<p>
Firstly, as a result of discussing E-Prime with you,<br>
I got the idea of "F-Prime" which basically consists<br>
of English minus Slavespeak.  This could turn out to<br>
be a major step in my forward motion.<br>
<p>
Secondly, I decided to convert about a third of 'Anatomy<br>
of Slavespeak' into E-Prime as an exercise.  For about 12<br>
years I've operated on the basis that "words don't have<br>
meanings; people have meanings for words."  But I was never<br>
quite satisfied with my reasoning and formulations on the<br>
issue.<br>
<p>
On applying E-Prime to this area, it was as if I was driven<br>
deeper into my mind.  I was pleasantly surprised by my new<br>
formulation:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Words Don't Have Meanings; People Have Meanings</i><br>
<i>&gt;-----------------------------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Many people suffer from the basic linguistic illusion that "words have</i><br>
meanings."<br>
<i>&gt;If a word has a meaning, where do you find it? Can it be found in the</i><br>
sound when<br>
<i>&gt;you say it?  Can you find it in the ink when you write it?  Can you find</i><br>
it in<br>
<i>&gt;the dictionary, or does the dictionary contain only words?  What</i><br>
characterizes<br>
<i>&gt;or distinguishes a meaning and how can you recognize it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Consider the possibility that:</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. Meanings reside in the individual brain;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. Individuals create, maintain and update their meanings;</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. Meanings consist of a "neural-patterns-of-instructions-and-associations";</i><br>
<i>&gt;4. A "neural-pattern-of-instructions-and-associations" can be compared to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;computer program that essentially tells the user how to use a particular</i><br>
word;<br>
<i>&gt;5. In order for an individual to use a word in a manner such that he or she</i><br>
<i>&gt;can think and communicate effectively, using that word, requires a brain</i><br>
program<br>
<i>&gt;vastly more complex, than the "brief-user-instructions" in the dictionary;</i><br>
<i>&gt;6. Even if you claim that the "brief-user-instructions" constitute the</i><br>
meaning<br>
<i>&gt;of a word, an individual couldn't use that word effectively without</i><br>
integrating<br>
<i>&gt;at least the meanings of all the words used in the "brief-user-instructions";</i><br>
<i>&gt;7. In order to use a word effectively, the "brief-user-instructions" have</i><br>
to be<br>
<i>&gt;"enriched" a thousand-fold, maybe a million-fold;</i><br>
<i>&gt;8. Operating on the basis that you personally create all the meaning in "your</i><br>
<i>&gt;universe" greatly increases your control over your mental processes, enabling</i><br>
<i>&gt;you to think, communicate, and act much more effectively.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Corresponding to the word "chair" I have in my brain a generalized picture</i><br>
<i>&gt;or template of a range of kinds of objects that qualify as chairs.  This</i><br>
forms<br>
<i>&gt;part of my meaning for the word "chair."  I also have links to other patterns</i><br>
<i>&gt;and memories I relate to "chair."  All of this complexity constitutes my</i><br>
meaning<br>
<i>&gt;for the word "chair" -- a meaning unique to me and vastly greater and more</i><br>
<i>&gt;complex than any "meaning" to be found in a dictionary -- yet similar to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;meanings others have for the word "chair."  My meaning (brain-program) for</i><br>
<i>&gt;using the word "chair" includes a module enabling me to determine, when</i><br>
<i>&gt;others use the word "chair," whether they use it more or less the same way</i><br>
<i>&gt;I do.  (No such "meaning" can be found in the dictionary.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We can communicate because (we have to assume that) when I say "chair," you</i><br>
<i>&gt;trigger, engage, or "boot up" in your brain a meaning similar to mine.</i><br>
Through<br>
<i>&gt;observing responses to communication we discern whether or not we refer</i><br>
the same<br>
<i>&gt;object when we say "chair."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Most importantly, we individually create, maintain, and update our personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;meanings.  Over time, we can improve our ability to use any particular word</i><br>
<i>&gt;more effectively.  We can learn vastly more about any given word than can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;found in the dictionary.  For example, I utilized a variant of English called</i><br>
<i>&gt;E-Prime to write the portion of this report dealing with GS.  E-Prime does</i><br>
not<br>
<i>&gt;contain the verb "to be" or any of its variants; otherwise E-Prime mirrors</i><br>
<i>&gt;standard English.  (You'll find the reasons for writing this way, below.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;You'll also find below, that my meaning for "to be" and its forms varies</i><br>
<i>&gt;dramatically from any "meaning" you can find in a regular dictionary.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now, what if our meanings constitute our most important creations by a</i><br>
long shot?<br>
<i>&gt;If so, to what extent do we render ourselves oblivious of our most important</i><br>
<i>&gt;creations?  Can we create anything physical, without first creating it</i><br>
internally<br>
<i>&gt;in a form that includes meaning?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If we render ourselves relatively oblivious of creating our meanings, how do</i><br>
<i>&gt;we affect our awareness of our physical creations and how much control do we</i><br>
<i>&gt;have?  How much responsibility can we demonstrate?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If we ascribe the creation of our meanings to agencies outside ourselves</i><br>
<i>&gt;("words have meanings"), do we perhaps disown a most important part of</i><br>
<i>&gt;ourselves?  Do we perform most of our "meaning-processing" more or less</i><br>
<i>&gt;unconsciously?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I've already benefited greatly from this debate,<br>
partcularly my association with you.<br>
<p>
Thank you,<br>
<p>
