BTW, for those who have not heard, Gene Shoemaker died this summer, in<br>
an auto accident while doing field work in Australia.  Shoemaker was a<br>
well known and articulate astronomer/geologist/planetary scientist, most<br>
famous for discovering comet Shoemaker-Levy, which crashed spectacularly<br>
into Jupiter in 1994.  He had made his mark earlier by establishing the<br>
extraterrestrial origin of Meteor Crater, near Winslow, Arizona.<br>
<p>
My wife took an intro geology class from Shoemaker when she was in college,<br>
and he had always been one of her favorite instructors.<br>
