 Max More, PhD   and I wrote back and forth in misunderstanding:<br>
<p>
Max: &gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks damien broderick.  ;-)<br>
<p>
Me: &gt;&gt;You're confusing me with danny, which satisfies neither of us.  :)<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Or maybe with Daniel Lee Crocker...  [distant scream, off]</i><br>
<p>
Max: &gt;Er, I don't think so. &lt;snip evidence against this implausible claim&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;Damien, I would never confuse your writing with Danny's. (BTW, its "Lee</i><br>
<i>&gt;Daniel" rather than "Daniel Lee".)</i><br>
<p>
Yes, indeed.  Quite.  My little attempt at a joke or two, sorry.  Perhaps<br>
only the professional book reviewer's eye/brain is warped enough to glom<br>
instantly onto the variants in capitalization and name order that I was<br>
playing with.  I'll try to restrain myself.  (But I was charmed a few days<br>
back when someone - was it Kennita? - referred to `Daniel Lee' quite soon<br>
after he'd mentioned his puzzlement at the habitual inversion of his name<br>
on this list.  I took it for a tease, and fell in with it here.)  <br>
<p>
And yes, there is surely something better I can do with my life, if<br>
anyone's about to suggest that I go off and Get One, so I'll nip off and<br>
have some muesili now before my brain cells harden and shrink for good.  :)<br>
 (Yes, at 11.40 am - I'm a late riser.)<br>
