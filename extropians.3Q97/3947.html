<i>&gt;&gt; The book is called 'Brainchild' by David Jay Brown and published by</i><br>

<p>
Going on the plodding, painfully expository passages Paul cited, I expected<br>
that to be true.  The author made just about every crude mistake that<br>
science fiction writers have learned to avoid during the last 60 or 70<br>
years - usually the mark of a neophyte enthralled by his or her ideas but<br>
without the patience to learn the medium (that is, to learn from the<br>
developments in narrative technique hard-won by pioneers).<br>
<p>
Oddly enough, this aesthetic evaluation has no force with plenty of<br>
readers, who lustily enjoy (for example) the Doc Smith space operas I wish<br>
I'd read when I was 12, before their gauche style and characterisation<br>
became intolerable to me.  A very funny book has been compiled from such<br>
sources - edited by Neil Gaiman and Kim Newman - appropriately titled<br>
GHASTLY BEYOND BELIEF.<br>
