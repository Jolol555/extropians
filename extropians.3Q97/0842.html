Actually there is strong anthropological evidence that the greeks had <br>
many psychedelic rites.  Their use of molded rye as a sacrament is well <br>
documented.  For those who don't know, molded rye yields LSD.<br>
<p>
As a general comment on this thread..I think there is more to <br>
extropianism than just technological progress.  Technologies potential <br>
to augment ourselves, is well though out on this list.  However, <br>
technology in &lt;itself&gt; provides more of a quantitative increase rather <br>
than a qualitative increase in our abilities.  You have to ask yourself, <br>
what would you do with a an IQ of 1000, once augmented by technology? <br>
Would it simply be used to have better reason, or would you seek new, <br>
and novel qualitative mentations and experiences (so call <br>
'rigth-brained' stuff)?  This is where tribal cultures have a lot to <br>
offer us.  We are certainly more advanced technologically than they are.  <br>
But do we have a qualitative advantage as well?  I doubt it.  If it <br>
wasn't for my psychedelic experiences this technological/evolutionary <br>
rocket we are riding, would become much more pointless - "more <br>
technology to go faster to get more technology to go faster to get <br>
more...."<br>

Warm Regards,<br>
