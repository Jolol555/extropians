<i>&gt; In fairness to Sci Am I should mention that the article was a fairly</i><br>
<i>&gt; evenhanded depiction of Rifkin, that didn't explicitly, or implicitly</i><br>
<i>&gt; as far as I could tell,</i><br>
<i>&gt; endorse his views. Anyone interested in science needs to be aware of</i><br>
<i>&gt; those who oppose it.  I found it a useful article b/c I know</i><br>
<i>&gt; very little about Rifkin, though I don't think the article in question</i><br>
<i>&gt; presented the whole picture.</i><br>

	Entropy: A New World Order by Jeremy Rifkin<br>
		 1981 Bantam Books, New York, NY <br>
		 ISBN 0-553-20215-4<br>
<p>
	It has been a long time since I read this book, but from what I can<br>
remember Jeremy Rifkin would be considered anti-extropian.  For example<br>
the opening line in the chapter entitled Toward a New Economic Theory,<br>
page 185; "There is no easy way to make a transition from a mechanical<br>
world view based on the idea of permanent material growth to an entropic<br>
world view based on the idea of conserving finite resources."  Another<br>
chapter is entitled "Diminishing Returns of Technology."  We can't beat<br>
Entropy so why fight it, kind of attitude.  He belonged to the crowd<br>
that was convinced that we were going to run out of oil and other<br>
mineral resources by the year 2000.  <br>
