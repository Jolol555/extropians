Sorry for the clotted terminology.  It's hard to know on an open list like<br>
this how much other people have read, what their clockspeed is, all that.<br>
I'm in the peculiar situation of never having done any science or math<br>
since... well, ever, since I got stuck in a technical school (wood work and<br>
sheet metal and like that) due to my renowned stupidity, and they weren't<br>
big on labs or science teachers...  BUT, despite that background I've been<br>
reviewing pop science books now for a decade for the Australian national<br>
newspaper, so I have a kind of lay sense of what's horseshit and what<br>
isn't.  M-theory, as I mention elsewhere, is membrane theory - hence<br>
`branes', which is a topological term of some generality.  Loopy space -<br>
Lee Smolin and Abhay Ashtekar have been developing a version of general<br>
relativity in which space and time are `foamy', made of `loops' (which<br>
recalls an earlier but failed approach by the genius John Wheeler, called<br>
`geometrodynamics').  These loops somewhat resemble the strings (and now<br>
membranes) of the alternative quantum-based elementary particle theories.<br>
TOE is Theory of Everything, which superstring theory aims to be but<br>
Smolin's current analysis, based on `evolving laws', denies is possible<br>
(sort of).  I recommend Smolin's new book THE LIFE OF THE COSMOS, but it<br>
might be a bit compressed as a starter.  Maybe try some of John Gribbin's<br>
recent books first - SCHRODINGER'S KITTENS, say.  Or one of Paul Davies' -<br>
SUPERFORCE is good, but out of date... but so is everything next week.  :)<br>
