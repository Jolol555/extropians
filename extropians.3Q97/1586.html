Remember the slaveways from Greg Bear's City of Angels? They are getting<br>
close...<br>
<p>
Perhaps we can get a firsthand report on this conference from Tom<br>
McKendree, who will be talking at the event, and thus unable to come to<br>
EXTRO 3.<br>

=== The Scoop ===============================<br>
<p>
Driving Down The Information<br>
Highway<br>
<p>
By Jeffrey R. Harrow, TechWeb Contributor<br>
<p>
It may come to pass -- and sooner than you think -- that your car will<br>
actually do the driving for you down an information-enabled highway.<br>
<p>
The National Automated Highway System Consortium has configured a<br>
7.6-mile section of California's I-15 so cars specially equipped with<br>
video cameras, magnets (to follow magnetic markers on the road) and<br>
radar will do just that.<br>
<p>
According to the NAHSC, the<br>
cost to retrofit existing highways is less than $10,000 per mile, and<br>
the group intends to open a prototype "driverless" highway to the<br>
public by 2002.<br>
<p>
Later this week, the NAHSC said it plans to demonstrate six automated<br>
driving scenarios on I-15's high-occupancy vehicle lanes.<br>
<p>
It would never happen, of course, but what if your computerized<br>
chauffeur was to crash, leading to the more tangible variety? (I'm sure<br>
there are safeguards, but ...) And if that unthinkable was to<br>
occur, would you be at fault? Who would be liable for damages?<br>
<p>
If it was a software bug, would the programmer potentially be liable<br>
for manslaughter? Would points accumulate on your driver's<br>
license or on that of your automotive CPU? Would your insurance rates<br>
go up, or would the rates paid by the automated highway or the car's<br>
manufacturer? <br>
<p>
Those are just the questions that quickly come to mind.<br>
<p>
Don't get me wrong -- I think automated highway lanes, as an<br>
option, are a valuable idea that almost certainly will come to pass.<br>
But I'm suggesting that, as we work out the technical details, we also<br>
remember that the implications of such a development go far beyond the<br>
technology. How will you, your parents and your kids react to this? How<br>
will the insurance companies and the state laws<br>
regarding drivers' responsibilities and liabilities have to change?<br>
<p>
And more. It will get very complicated as the rapidly changing face of<br>
computing and the rapidly traveling automobile merge into the same lane<br>
on the asphalt highway. <br>
