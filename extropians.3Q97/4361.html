the Singularity could be something like the Blight I don't think fear of<br>

<p>
Regard them as human?  Half the time I regard myself as "an AI wannabee<br>
trapped in a male human body".  The difference between the Culture and<br>
the Singularity isn't one of AI rights, or technical capability, or<br>
maximum intelligence.  It's one of ethics, of the behaviors of<br>
civilization surviving through and beyond a rapid transition.  If I was<br>
in the Culture I'd happily fork, or even destructively upload, and grow<br>
my way up to Mind status.<br>
<p>
But I'd be happy knowing that the Amish were still toiling the soil in<br>
Pennsylvania.  Not because I have great love for the Amish, but because<br>
a Mind-civilization which had that much respect for pre-existing<br>
sentience would be a profoundly safe and libertarian (liberal) society<br>
for anyone else.  The image of Singularity I get these days is one of<br>
everything going totally haywire.  But I don't see any proof that's<br>
inevitable.  So I root for civlization.<br>

"For instance, suppose we apply this to nuclear weapon explosions over<br>
inhabited cities.  The Copernican principle says that we don't have a<br>
privileged position within the interval of such usage - odds are, most<br>
of them have already happened.  And the odds that there are thousands<br>
and thousands to come?  Just astronomical.  So don't worry, be happy -<br>
no nuclear wars can ever happen, probably."<br>
