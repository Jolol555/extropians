In a message dated 97-07-15 21:58:32 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; This is way off topic, but it's a meme-jungle out there.  An ep of the<br>
 Chris Carter series `Millennium' was shown here in Oz the other night, in<br>
 which the Grand Key to It All (maybe) is revealed as an impending planetary<br>
 line-up of seven planets, all neatly on the same side of the sun as the<br>
 earth, in May 2000.  Not having a digital orrey to hand, I wonder if anyone<br>
 who does have access to such a program could confirm or deny this detail?<br>
 I find it hard to believe, and assume the scriptwriters just kinda...<br>
 rearranged the solar system, to make the story work.<br>

Hi, yes it will happen, but I heard that all the rest of the planets were<br>
gonna be on the other side of the sun than us.  Either way there will be an<br>
allignment.  Also, many people, including scientists and researchers, believe<br>
that there will be a pole shift on that day, in which the pole will shift on<br>
its axis with antarctica going to the equator.  There's lots of stuff to back<br>
up this theory, such as there being trees on antarctica and the ancient<br>
egyptians saying that the sun used to rise in the west.  There's lots of<br>
books on the subject.  Oh ya, the big thing, all the cataclysms that are<br>
suppose to occur on that day, earthquakes, 500 mile an hour winds(although i<br>
think that all the winds will turn into lots of hurricanes, dropping the<br>
windspeed to 200+), 300 ft tidal waves, widespread freezes, and sea levels<br>
rising (from Antarctica going to the sea, either by sliding off, due to the<br>
momentum and because it is slippery where the ice meets land because ice<br>
turns to sludge with a lot of pressure, causing tidal waves for slipping in,<br>
or it will eventually melt).  But the main thing is the shift in<br>
consciousness it will bring.<br>
