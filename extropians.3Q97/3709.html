<i>&gt; It seems that Mr. Elis a/k/a Hagbard, believes that my comments darken the</i><br>

<i>&gt; is simply bewildered?</i><br>
<i>&gt; The use of the word OBFUSCATORY as Mr. Elis proffers it seems, in some</i><br>
<i>&gt; sense, a bit sophomoric. Is it possible that despite the breadth of his</i><br>
<i>&gt; reading he lacks the depth of perception necessary to understand my humble</i><br>
<i>&gt; and eglectic philosophies.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can understand as well that there are some who choose to reject concepts</i><br>
<i>&gt; outside their limited experience and the constraints imposed by their</i><br>
<i>&gt; culture. There are those as well who attempt to transcend the external</i><br>
<i>&gt; restraints or constraints of their culture and who wish to develop greater</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Despite such bland rejection as Mr. Elis wishes to present, let us all</i><br>
<i>&gt; (hopefully including Mr. Elis) search our minds and remove such clouds as</i><br>
<i>&gt; may prevent us from seing far greater realities than we have previously</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Can we all say "Cogito ergo sum" and speed onward into unexplored</i><br>
<i>&gt; thoughts?</i><br>
<p>
I'll let you have the last public word on this since it's relatively off<br>
topic.<br>
<p>
Sorry to irk you with my unique species of sophomoric humor, no offense<br>
meant. And you are a lyrical writer, perhaps stilted, but it sure sounds<br>
nice. Anyway, I'll keep it above the belt from here on in.<br>

Tabula rasa,<br>
