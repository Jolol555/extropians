[SNIP - Gregory Chaitin, Algorithmic Information Content (AIC),<br>
Charles Bennett’s measure of Depth]<br>
&lt;Depth helps but it doesn't solve everything, the works of a monkey<br>
are still more complex than Shakespeare. I think part of the problem<br>
is that all information is not of equal value, and it's difficult to<br>
get a handle on that mathematically.&gt;<br>
<p>
That "all information is not of equal value" implies meaning, or<br>
semantics.  The AIC and "depth" measures are strictly syntactic. <br>
Semantics basically involves categorization and context.  <br>
<p>
In the most general terms, it seems to me that complexity could be<br>
measured by the number of different functional relationships a system<br>
can maintain, and might further be weighted by the number of functions<br>
it can perform simultaneously.<br>
<p>
As for getting a handle on this mathematically, set theory seems to be<br>
helpful for analyzing relationships between things other than numbers.<br>
You might enjoy Luis Rocha’s essay "Evidence Sets: Contextual<br>
Categories" at <a href="http://ssie.binghamton.edu/~rocha/es_contx.html">http://ssie.binghamton.edu/~rocha/es_contx.html</a>  which<br>
describes how <br>
&lt;Evidence Sets are set formalisms which extend fuzzy sets and interval<br>
valued fuzzy sets through the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence (DST)<br>
[and are] well positioned to model human linguistic categorization<br>
processes because they offer a mechanism to explicitly contextualize<br>
uncertainty. Each of the graded intervals of membership is associated<br>
with a particular context, which can then be reduced or eliminated as<br>
more evidence is gained through an extended theory of approximate<br>
reasoning or through the incorporation of more knowledge into the<br>
model by pragmatic, evolutionary, strategies.&gt;<br>
<p>
JKC:<br>
&lt;I also think it would be a mistake to equate complexity with virtue,<br>
in fact all things being equal, the opposite is true. A simple program<br>
is better than a complex one that does the same thing. A simple<br>
ecosystem such as a temperate forest of oaks and conifers is more<br>
resilient than a very complex one like a tropical rain forest.&gt;<br>
<p>
The temperate forest is more resilient than the tropical forest by<br>
whose measure (survivability against current human agricultural<br>
practices?)  What is "the same thing" that these two types of forests<br>
do (provide a green coloring on the map?)  I’m sure ecologists have<br>
better measures of forest complexity, I’m just not familiar with them.<br>
<p>
As for programs: I can write a terse program with lots of hardcoded<br>
constants and clever optimized algorithms that is simpler than another<br>
program performing the same fixed function, and probably much more<br>
efficient in its execution speed; but, the more complex program, which<br>
might have much more parameterization and be more data-driven by<br>
looking up values in external files, is going to be more flexible and<br>
possibly more maintainable.<br>
<p>
Simplicity IS virtuous at a certain level of abstraction and<br>
operation, but monotonic functions usually tend to get assembled (or<br>
gobbled up) into more complex organizations. <br>
<p>
Bruce Edmonds argues in his "What is Complexity?" essay at<br>
<a href="http://www.fmb.mmu.ac.uk/~bruce/evolcomp/evolcomp.txt">http://www.fmb.mmu.ac.uk/~bruce/evolcomp/evolcomp.txt</a><br>
that <br>
&lt;Complexity . . . is unlikely to have any useful value as applied to<br>
"real" objects or systems.  Further that even relativising it to an<br>
observer has problems. It is proposed that complexity can usefully be<br>
applied only to constructions within a given language. It is argued<br>
that complexity is usefully differentiated from the concepts of size,<br>
ignorance, variety, minimum description length and order. A definition<br>
of complexity is proposed which can be summarised as "that property of<br>
a language expression which makes it difficult to formulate its<br>
overall behaviour even when given almost complete information about<br>
its atomic components and their inter-relations." Some of the<br>
consequences of this definition are discussed.&gt;<br>
<p>
Perhaps you are really saying, as Edmonds put it, that "the reduction<br>
in complexity of our interaction with any part of reality is an<br>
essential component of our existence"; or, the more simplicity we can<br>
achieve in our interactions the more fit we will be (Kauffman’s<br>
"number of conflicting constraints" notion of complexity).  But, it’s<br>
also wise to remember that this makes us more dependent on all these<br>
‘black boxes’ or infrastructure that we’ve built to simplify things<br>
for us.<br>
