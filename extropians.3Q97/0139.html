<i>&gt;to any other. I don't know about you, but if I feel that my way of </i><br>
<i>&gt;thinking about things (my philosophy) is inferior to any other, I set </i><br>
<i>&gt;about trying to find the superior theory - so I can learn it and </i><br>
<i>&gt;integrate it.</i><br>
<p>
I admire that you have set these goals for yourself, but I myself shy <br>
away from ranking sets of philosophy in this manner.  Not only does <br>
it bring up the E-Prime problem, to heirarchically rank human thought <br>
conjures the very shades of ideology I seek to avoid in the first <br>
place.  I prefer to think of it in terms:  'this set of thinking is most <br>
useful to me in my life'.  If I cannot find a useful philosphy, I <br>
would develop one!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To commit means to pledge one's self to a *position* on an </i><br>
<i>&gt;issue, right? </i><br>
<p>
Not necessarily, and if you based your entire polemic on this <br>
contention, I ask that you rethink it.  Humans make commitments <br>
every day, either to a value, to a decision, to a way of thinking, <br>
otherwise we would not be able to take any actions.  If anything, <br>
Richter was responding to the demand to commit to an ideology with a <br>
counter-commitment not to fall into position-based thinking.<br>
