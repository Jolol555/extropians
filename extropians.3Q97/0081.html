Name any "establishment" and RAW has satired it.<br>
<p>
While I agree with you that much of his railing against Sagan seems a<br>
bit unfounded (almost personal?), Sagan represents for RAW what the Holy<br>
Inquisition reprsented to Galileo. RAW argues that any scientific claim<br>
that does not comport with established (?) scientific dogma is a<br>
"damnable heresy" and is branded "pseudo-science" or "poor scientific<br>
method" or some other dismissive.  For this, the scientific<br>
establishment uses the Infallible Method: They only believe that which<br>
can be demonstrated to their reason, and they are able to demonstrate to<br>
their reason only that which they are willing to believe.   <br>
<p>
RAW is not a scientist, he's a satirist. Read a few pages of Right Where<br>
You Are Sitting Now and you'll be annoyed with yourself for having<br>
gotten so worked up over it all. It's like being offended at Gulliver's<br>
Travels. His self-ordained mission in life is what he calls "guerrilla<br>
ontology" or "epistemological judo." He seeks only to warp our set<br>
notions of reality into what he calls new "reality tunnels;" much akin<br>
to taking off the lenses we've grown up with, and putting on new ones.<br>
He wants us to question everything. He accomplishes this by mixing just<br>
enough fact with just enough fiction such that the entire thing is<br>
believable. If you take him too seriously, you take yourself too<br>
seriously. <br>
<p>
While others may disagree with me on whether or not he really believes<br>
Sagan is a no-good-shit, one thing is certain: "When the Walls Came<br>
Tumbling Down" is hitting bookstores soon, I'll be there with money in<br>
hand.<br>
