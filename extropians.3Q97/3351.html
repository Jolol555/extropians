<p>
The easiest way to "explain" that is to point out that it's bullshit.<br>
Life has never been better.  Health has never been better.  The poor<br>
have never been as rich as they are today.  That doesn't seem to stop<br>
lots of people from complaining about all this prosperity, though.<br>
No matter how much they have, they think they need more and need to<br>
work harder to get it.<br>
<p>
It's a fair bet that anyone talking about how bad things are is too<br>
young to remember when most of the American economy was supported<br>
by farmers working 16-hour days in the fields; when children died of<br>
polio and rickets; when an 80-year-old man was a rarity; when fruit<br>
all year round was a luxury only rich travellers could afford; when<br>
smallpox and typhoid and tuberculosis ran unopposed; when even a<br>
typical middle-class family couldn't afford to eat out more than once<br>
a week; when children's toys were board games and wagons instead of<br>
electronics; when birth control wasn't cheap and reliable...<br>
<p>
If you're working too hard, it's because you want more than a small<br>
amount of work will provide; perhaps society conspires to call that<br>
level of wealth "poverty", and therefore undesirable, but in absolute<br>
terms it's a pretty good deal today.<br>
