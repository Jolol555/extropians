In a Political Science class in college, I read an interesting book<br>
called "Groupthink." It was a study of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the<br>
reasons for why JFK's administration pushed us so close to nuclear war.<br>
<i>&gt;From what I remember, groupthink is a colorful term for an overemphasis</i><br>
on consensus. In a bureacracy where nothing is unilaterally decided,<br>
nobody is 100% responsible, and everyone sinks with the ship, nothing<br>
will get done unless it is agreed upon by all. The real-world effects of<br>
this have consequences for public policy. That is, where a committee<br>
begins its deliberations on a matter with the understood assumption that<br>
they all *must* eventually agree, they always will. This means that<br>
other options are not fully explored, or "loose cannons" are brought<br>
back in line not by argument but by outside political pressure, etc.<br>
Unfortunately, I don't remember even the barest sketch of how it applied<br>
to the Cuban Missile Crisis, but it was interesting nonetheless.<br>
