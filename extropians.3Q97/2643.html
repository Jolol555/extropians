Sorry Folks...the devil made me do it...I just found this in my "e-mail<br>
box"...it seems appropriate.<br>
<p>
NO MEDIA BIAS: "This is your ace news anchor, and it's the year 1543<br>
A.D. The modern study of astronomy has shown the superiority of the<br>
human intellect in discerning the movement of the stars, the sun, moon,<br>
and the planets around the earth, as first deduced by the great Greek<br>
astronomer Ptolemy 1400 years ago. The geocentric universe is well<br>
rooted in both science and religion, and has been an accepted fact since<br>
nearly the beginning of recorded history. After all, anyone can simply<br>
stand outside and watch the sky, and see the sun and moon rising in the<br>
east, revolving overhead above a firm and unmoving earth, and finally<br>
setting on the other side of the sky. How could anything be more obvious<br>
than that the earth is stationary, and the heavenly bodies are revolving<br>
about our earth at the center of the universe? Yet every so often,<br>
someone challenges the truth and tries to advance extremist views. Yet<br>
we believe in diversity, and we will bring you those fringe theories as<br>
they arise, for you, our audience, to hear. We now join our expert media<br>
analyst, expert astronomer, and expert on just about everything else<br>
worth being an expert in. Our expert is interviewing that backbencher<br>
Copernicus about his radical, some might say extremist, publication<br>
which he calls "On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres". Over to<br>
you..."<br>
<p>
     "Mr. Copernicus, you have been called an extremist, a bombthrower,<br>
for your belief that, if I have it right, the earth is actually spinning<br>
around in space, and is actually moving around the sun. Now, if your<br>
fantastic theory is correct, there are times when some of us are<br>
actually hanging upside down. Now please tell our audience, do you<br>
really believe all that? Spinning around and we don't get dizzy? Hanging<br>
upside down and we don't fall off? Are you telling this audience that<br>
every focus group and opinion poll is wrong, and that people have been<br>
wrong for over 1000 years? Mr. Copernicus? Mr. Copernicus? I'm sorry<br>
folks, Copernicus has just walked off, refusing to talk to us, muttering<br>
something about media bias. Back to you at the anchor desk."<br>
<p>
     "Thanks. Our audience appreciates your attempt to throw the light<br>
of truth on the dark underside of society. Every once in a while some<br>
mean spirited radical comes along with unproven ideas, trying to upset<br>
the settled facts as everyone knows them to be, and we here at the<br>
Narrowmind News Network will continue to report on those fringe<br>
theories, and continue bringing you the real facts, truthfully and<br>
without bias. For the children."<br>
<p>
     Sometimes truth is a matter of perspective. Falsity becomes<br>
accepted as conventional wisdom, and anyone voicing such wisdom does<br>
not, in their eyes, display bias by simply stating the facts.<br>
Conversely, anyone challenging the conventional wisdom is deemed to be<br>
on the fringes of society. How could it be otherwise? How can one be<br>
biased by simply stating the "truth"? Those who perceive the<br>
conventional wisdom to be in error understand that the speaker of the<br>
"truth" is speaking with bias. Our media is infected with a pro-status<br>
quo bias, and enunciation of the conventional wisdom brings their<br>
reporting no closer to the truth. Our "independent" media operates as<br>
much of a disinformation machine as any run by any totalitarian<br>
government of the past. By subtle distortion, selective reporting, and<br>
outright misrepresentation, our media paints the picture which they<br>
believe advances their goal of maintaining their position of power and<br>
influence in our society<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The above comes via something called "RightNow"...for us conservative,<br>
bombthrowing anarchist reactionary types.<br>
