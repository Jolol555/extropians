They're not out of business because they ARE the business.  What people <br>
feel about Microsoft is largley irrelevant to what choices they have <br>
when buying a computer.  Between the advertising of Intel and Microsoft <br>
a new computer buyer thinks that if it din't say "Intel Inside" it's not <br>
a computer.<br>

With regards to Rockefellers tactics, your facts of history are wrong. <br>
Rockefeller did not have to lower his prices everywhere - &lt;only in those <br>
places he was opening new gas stations&gt;.  History shows this worked <br>
quite well to his advantage.<br>
<p>
I have to make one very important point.  Since we don't actually live <br>
yet in a free-market economy, all we can do is speculate as to how it <br>
might work; thus my questions are theoretical.  My intention is to <br>
increase my overall comprehension of free-market economics.  By doing <br>
so, I am taking on the roll of 'devils advocate' to see how others on <br>
this list can respond to any holes I might see.<br>
<p>
So far, people have made some pretty fair arguments regarding Microsoft <br>
- although I still think some of Microsoft's historical tactics of been <br>
anti-competitive.<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
