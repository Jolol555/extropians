<i>&gt; Do you think I mention terms, of my area of expertise, without knowing</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I still, today, can't understand why do you (or some of you) think this</i><br>
<i>&gt; would happen. And that certainly puzzled me up a bit. BTW, I still think</i><br>
<i>&gt; monopolies happen in a free-market</i><br>
<p>
In a free market, there is nothing stopping someone from starting up a<br>
small business to compete with a monopolistic business.  There may be<br>
monopolies in the sense of one business supplying all of product X, but at<br>
least there is the *potential* for someone else to come along and fell<br>
that monopoly.  With government, true monopolies are possible.<br>
Governments, in fact, are the largest monopolies in the world.  The second<br>
largest are those monopolies created by governments.  I'll give you<br>
some Canadian examples.  IN my home province of British Columbia, the<br>
telephone company was an enforced monopoly.  Competition was against the<br>
law made by the *government*  A competing company wasn't even allowed to<br>
try.  Recently, that monopoly has been lifted, bringing in new companies<br>
to compete and lower prices.  One of the advantages I have immediately is<br>
access to cheaper internet access.  This is what happens when government<br>
takes its hands out of the market.  Example 2: Federal government has just<br>
extended the patent period on new medical drugs to 20 years.  What does<br>
this mean?  It means the government has created a bunch of 20 year<br>
monopolies- they can charge whatever they want for 20 years, since they<br>
have no competition.  Has this been a good explanation?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and I still can't understand why</i><br>
<i>&gt; would negative feedback prevent this and the exploration of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; population by any corp.</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; `Negative feedback' is *not* primarily an economics term, but derives from</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Perhaps it is called something entirely different in your own language, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it is defined in most English dictionaries.  I keep a dictionary on my</i><br>

or english grammar ;)<br>

<i>&gt; skills. Also, actually disagreeing with EvMick's point was not a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; way to understand what he was trying to say.</i><br>
<p>
Good point, Joao.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I hope this matter is dead and buried (Damien, I know your intention is</i><br>

<i>&gt; speaking, I think I'm a much better human being now that I know the</i><br>
<i>&gt; meaning of negative</i><br>
<i>&gt; feedback and why corporations won't be able to be in a monopoly</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I was looking for information but even I wasn't sure about how serious</i><br>
<i>&gt; this information would be.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If you are really interested in learning about anything READ BOOKS!  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you think book reading is "boring" you clearly have little interest in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; acquiring knowledge.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There are books that I find amusing to read, there are books I find</i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting to read and there are books I find boring to read (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; usually stop in the beginning). I read several books about aging, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; subject I find most interesting and disturbing but I never read a book</i><br>
<i>&gt; about economics and would probably be bored to death if I would. It's a</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter or choice and personal taste.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I might read a couple of articles on the net about economy, I still have</i><br>
<i>&gt; some doubts I would like to clear out. Perhaps one day I even read a</i><br>
<i>&gt; book about economy!</i><br>
<p>
Not a bad idea.  You can imagine how frustrating it would be to debate<br>
with me about cryosuspension if I knew nothing about cryonics or aging-<br>
especially if I thought I knew what I was talking about!<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; this crime, and I'll apologize now to all those people who see my newbie</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; posts as same old, same old.   </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Tell me something, wouldn't you like to see the extropian movement</i><br>
<i>&gt; expand itself? </i><br>
<p>
That sounds like a nice idea.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Wouldn't you like to see more extropians than there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; now? </i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't mind some more people to talk to.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Presumably, the answer is yes. Do you think you teach other persons</i><br>
<i>&gt; the extropian principles and thought by telling them to read books?</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  Learning requires one person.(and an information source)  Debating<br>
requires two.  From your posts, it is evident that you need to do the<br>
former, before you do the latter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Personally, I have a fame of being a good guitarist, do you think that</i><br>
<i>&gt; when someone asks me how to do a A chord, I tell him/her that he/she is</i><br>
<i>&gt; stupid and should go and look for it in a book?</i><br>
<p>
No, but teaching someone how to play an A is not a particularly difficult<br>
or time consuming process.  If you had read War and Peace, and I came up<br>
to you and asked "tell me everything that happens in War and Peace,"<br>
wouldn't you just say "Go read the book!"  I know I would, unless the<br>
person couldn't read.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even more time-taking</i><br>
<i>&gt; questions, do you think I just say that people who ask me these</i><br>
<i>&gt; questions are ignorant and shouldn't even deserve to be by my side?</i><br>
<p>
Of course they're ignorant!  They're ignorant of the A chord.  As for not<br>
deserving to be by your side, who, exactly, said that???  I think I may<br>
have missed that post.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course not, I would like more and more persons to learn guitar and since</i><br>
<i>&gt; I love it, I teach anyone who asks me to, within the limits of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge, even that I have to give the same answer 10, 20, 100, 500</i><br>
<i>&gt; times.</i><br>
<p>
What if you are asked this question so many times, it begins to detract<br>
from your aging research?  Then, would you be so altruistic?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now, do you think that you spread the extropian movement by sitting</i><br>
<i>&gt; around thinking: - I'm very smart, the others are ignorants and only</i><br>
<i>&gt; when they, by their own means, know as much as I, will I then see them</i><br>
<i>&gt; as my fellows.</i><br>
<p>
hmmm... I must have missed a lot of the posts.  When was all this said?<br>
Is it possible you're reading a little to much into people's suggestion :<br>
"Go read a book."?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Honestly, this is how some of you acted when I asked my</i><br>
<i>&gt; questions, if you really want to make the extropian movement (or any</i><br>
<i>&gt; other ideology) grow, you have to teach people it's principles, many</i><br>
<i>&gt; times. Do you think Jesus Christ (no matter your religion, you have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; admit he was good at convincing people) just answered questions by</i><br>
<i>&gt; saying: - Read it in the bible, it will be out in a decade or so.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's true that the subject I was asking questions about was not directly</i><br>
<i>&gt; an extropian subject </i><br>
<p>
Sure it is, it's just been debated to death.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;but, even so, you (I take this opportunity to say</i><br>
<i>&gt; that when I say "you" I don't mean all of you but a few who certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt; know that this message is directed at them) showed a lack of will to</i><br>
<i>&gt; teach others that won't lead you nowhere in terms of spreading your</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas.</i><br>
<p>
People are here to discuss and debate, not to convert you.  Extropianism<br>
is a dynamic philosophy... at the same time, Extropian discussion is<br>
well-established.  Some things have been discussed more than they deserve,<br>
because some people refuse to inform themselves before they start making<br>
decisive comments.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Instead of being a small group of which no-one (at least in Portugal)</i><br>
<i>&gt; has ever heard of, and taking 20, 50, 100 or 500 years to develop</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotech and life extension, if others would support "our" (this is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "our" between commas because I don't agree with all your principles)</i><br>
<i>&gt; cause this objectives would much soon be achieved.</i><br>
<p>
True, but this should be achieved without coercion.  I take responsibility<br>
for my own education- I don't expect others to be there to answer my<br>
questions when the answers are at my local library.  Once I have this<br>
information, I can make an informed debate, and decide for myself the<br>
validity of this information.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Maybe people are glancing over your posts because you have obviously</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; glanced over the introductory message to this mailing list.  Joao, people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are not impressed with your posts because you have obviously not read any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of the suggested material in the introductory message to this mailing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; list.  Your post is not uncommon; on the contrary, posts like yours are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bogging this list, and people are getting a little tired of answering the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; same old questions, over and over.  I'm sure you can understand this.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; OK, I went over and read the introduction to the mailing list. First, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; read Dawkin's books suggested in the introduction but that was it.</i><br>
<p>
The Selfish Gene will not five you enough information to effectively<br>
debate economics.<br>
<p>
If I told you "the A chord isn't actually an A, it's a B flat", you would<br>
say I'm wrong.  What if I replied: "I don't believe you, but I don't want<br>
to read any books on subject... maybe I will eventually get around to it.<br>
In the mean time, I don't believe you.  It's obvious that the A chord is<br>
actually B flat, I don't understand how you can even begin to think it's<br>
not."  Wouldn't that make you a little frustrated? (come on, be honest ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Second, although there are a few suggestions to asking questions about</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything, I found this:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The Extropian list is not meant to proselytize, to gain converts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Personally, like I mention above, I completely disagree.</i><br>
<p>
Extropianism is not a religion.  <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; As a conclusion, like I mentioned in my last message, I won't bother you</i><br>
<i>&gt; again about economics or any issues in which I don't have a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge (great, I'll just write about aging, at least in that subject</i><br>
<i>&gt; I can take on anyone).</i><br>
<p>
You sound very confident.  I'm willing to debate aging with you (as I<br>
already have)  I'm also willing to read more books about aging to make it<br>
a more informed debate.<br>
