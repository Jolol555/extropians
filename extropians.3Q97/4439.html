        I have always disliked the whole idea of "left" and "right" in<br>
politics (or non-politics, as it may be.)  By saying that one is "left<br>
wing" it gives the impression that the person in question has *only* left<br>
wing tendencies when they may possess many "right wing" qualities as well.<br>
The Advocates for Self-Government has a somewhat more effective (IMO)<br>
method by dividing a chart into five different political sections then<br>
asking key questions to position one on the chart.  Although this may be an<br>
improvement to the conventional left\right scale, it still leaves much to<br>
be desired.  Probably the easiest way to find someone's views in politics<br>
is to simply ask their opinion on the purpose of government and why.  If<br>
one says that they think that government should be abolished, obviously<br>
they are anarchists; if their reason is because the government has done<br>
virtually nothing to feed the starving and homeless, then their position is<br>
pretty obvious.<br>
