<i>&gt;  &gt;I wish to warn you about a new crime ring that is targeting business</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;travelers. This ring is well organized, well funded, has very skilled</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;personnel, and is currently in most major cities and recently very</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;active in New Orleans. The crime begins when a business traveler goes</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;to a lounge for a drink at the end of the work day. A person in the bar</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;walks up as they sit alone and offers to buy them a drink. The last</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;thing the traveler remembers until they wake up in a hotel room bath</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;tub, their body submerged to their neck in ice, is sipping that drink.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
This is, of course, urban legend.  However, if it were true, New <br>
Orleans would be the place for it (speaking as a former long-time <br>
resident).  They'd come in from the sticks, we'd keep telling them <br>
"the best looking women aren't women" but would they listen to us?  <br>
Nooo....  <br>
