As I said, most people who hold this belief seem caught up in the myth of<br>
"childhood innocence". You seem to be under the impression that kids are<br>
somehow rational, civilised people with whom you can "negotiate<br>
disputes", and ignore the rather obvious fact that most kids are far more<br>
vicious and irrational than most adults. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;How does the weakest boy in the class negotiate with a pack of 8</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;apparently intent on beating him up? That was part of my childhood.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I made it very clear in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the sentence following my statement above that adults should step</i><br>
<i>&gt;into a situation that is dangerous for the child.</i><br>
<p>
Of course, in my experience the adults would do no such thing. Either<br>
they believed, as you do, that kids should be left to fend for<br>
themselves, or they just couldn't care less. None of our complaints to<br>
teachers had any long-term effect on the vicious thugs, and in many cases<br>
made the situation worse by giving them a reason to 'get even' with us.<br>
<p>
The only reliable method we found to deal with them was to throw a knife<br>
at their leader's head (which would, of course, have got us in deep shit<br>
if they'd reported it to any teachers); they stopped messing with us<br>
after that. Frankly I can't think of anything worse for a kid than to put<br>
them in a situation where they're threatened daily by vicious thugs, can<br>
do nothing whatsoever about it without potentially getting into real<br>
trouble themselves, and can't even get an adult to help.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Your example does</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing to obviate the need for crucial socialization into</i><br>
<i>&gt;assertiveness skills, and I also never stated that a home schooling</i><br>
<i>&gt;parent could not provide those settings necessary for that type of</i><br>
<i>&gt;development.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that a home-schooling parent probably couldn't provide the<br>
settings required to learn such "moron management" skills. I strongly<br>
disagree that I or any kid of mine have a need for such skills. What they<br>
need is experience of dealing with the kind of reasonably civilised and<br>
rational adults who they will be working with in the future. What better<br>
way to do that than to spend time with those kind of adults? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, one need not "throw onto a playground" any child for that child</i><br>
<i>&gt;to encounter bullies or other threatening types, and certainly some</i><br>
<i>&gt;sort of training is necessary for every child to deal with bad</i><br>
<i>&gt;situations.</i><br>
<p>
So send them on a martial arts or Practical Pistol course, where they can<br>
learn those skills without being beaten up by vicious thugs. Otherwise,<br>
to take your comments to their logical conclusion, we should drop our<br>
kids off in Watts at an early age and let them find their own way home.<br>
If any of them don't come back, well, that's just "evolution in action". <br>
