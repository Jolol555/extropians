I did, thanks for the reference.  It's very cool stuff if it pans out.  Bear<br>
in mind when you read it that it was all written by Frank himself, and there<br>
is a natural human tendency to minimize the weight of disagreeable evidence.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;New news about getting peppered daily by icebergs...10 million a</i><br>
<i>&gt;year...evidence mounts that this is indeed the case...</i><br>
<p>
Frank hasn't published any technical article on his recent results.  The<br>
press releases sure look good, but so did the press releases on a bunch of<br>
things that turned out to be bogus.  It's impossible to judge his results at<br>
this time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also a sorry commentary on what happens to someone who dares to go against</i><br>
<i>&gt;the status quo...apparently scientists aren't as "truth searching" as they</i><br>
<i>&gt;would like us to beleive.  Maybe if the truth were to fit established theory?</i><br>
<p>
Let's see... he kept his job, lots of people discussed his theory, and the<br>
government gave him several million dollars to put an instrument up on a<br>
satellite to decide matters one way or another.  The worst thing that<br>
happened was that almost everyone told him he was wrong.  Now, if he turns<br>
out to be right, he becomes very famous and respected.  It seems to me that<br>
this is science working exactly the way it ought to.  How would you have had<br>
people act differently?  <br>
