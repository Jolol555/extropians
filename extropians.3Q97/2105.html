This question is a cheerful and spunky way to start the day.<br>

<p>
Now, let's not jump to conclusions about "half its matter."<br>
<p>
Remember, you don't have to duplicate all the information unless you're<br>
worried about losing *all* (and only one copy of) the information.  To<br>
recover from one bit lost out of m, you need something like log2(m) extra<br>
check bits.  As the number of errors you want to be safe from approaches<br>
infinity (it could be &gt; m) the checkbits per loseable bit goes down toward<br>
one.  RAID experts correct me if I'm wrong.<br>
<p>
Me I would have my information scattered in secret--or very public--<br>
places.  On my enemies' computers, for one example.<br>
<p>
In a universe converted to computers, and assuming there are still<br>
the famously problematical Other Entities, then there would be<br>
a market in storage with various combinations of features like speed<br>
and safety.  So your casual information or temporary working storage<br>
might be stored in cheap but flakey memory, your more critical<br>
information multiply backed up and distributed, and your really<br>
crucial core self-definition stuff incorporated into every cubic<br>
meter of the universe, say.  (I mean if you're just starting to plan<br>
your personal storage policy, this might be a good place to start.)<br>
<p>
Then there's the opportunity of "mutual information".  Not only do<br>
different people keep literal copies of the same things, but different<br>
chunks of information can be similar in the sense that you can save space<br>
by compressing the combination rather than compressing each separately.<br>
This means that the storage services could save space by only storing<br>
once what more than one person wants stored.<br>
<p>
So you might not have to store your own copy of "what it means to be<br>
an intelligent entity," or "what a libertarian gets out of the New York<br>
Times," only the uniquely-you stuff.  And of course the more of a Taoist<br>
you are, the more you simply mirror the Way Things Are, so that fewer<br>
and fewer things that can happen count as errors for you.  If you become<br>
completely One with the laws of nature then nothing can violate you.<br>
If you are the universe there is no catastrophe against which you need<br>
backups, Max.  So don't spend your retirement in paranoia--kick back<br>
and relax, you've earned it!<br>
<p>
The problem of saving space on mutual information without compromising<br>
privacy or the desire to have actual redundant copies (if you contract<br>
out to someone to store your backups, how do you know he isn't just<br>
storing them on your system as redundant copies that you've compressed<br>
away?), seems really tough but worth pursuing.<br>
