<p>
The space shuttle, as currently designed, represents an<br>
earth-orbit vehicle.  According to what I've read, it does not<br>
have the ability to achieve escape velocity.  Wait until a<br>
threatening asteroid gets inside range of the orbital capability<br>
of the shuttle, and you lose.  While the space shuttles may have<br>
the ability to move the necessary classes of components into a<br>
parking orbit where, conceivably, those parts might get built into<br>
something useful, the integrated time-payload-capacity of the<br>
current fleet of shuttles might represent "too little, too late."<br>
And that doesn't even begin to consider such issues as:<br>
<p>
1:  sufficiently early detection and tracking<br>
2:  systems required to deflect an asteroid<br>
    ('Breaking-up' a large cast-iron block strikes me as not<br>
    a probable solution.)<br>
3:  delivery systems for the deflection systems<br>
4:  control systems<br>
5:  task planning and implementation<br>
<p>
Toss into the works the inevitable screams of complaint about even<br>
*trying* to perform such a task, ("What if what you do makes<br>
things worse?"  "You have no right to interfere with God's will"<br>
"No asteroid is going to hit -- that just represents a lot of bunk<br>
intended to 'feather the nest' of already rich industrialists,"<br>
"Isn't messing up the earth bad enough -- now you want to mess up<br>
the ecology of the solar system?" etc.) and I infer that we stand<br>
unprepared.<br>
<p>
But I'm not terribly concerned;  I see the odds against an<br>
asteroid hit as sufficiently reassuring for the remainder of my<br>
lifetime that worrying about it will not keep me up nights.  So<br>
far as I'm concerned, the two most important lessons to learn<br>
relate to:<br>
<p>
1:  Sane choices do not come out of the 'convincing'-character<br>
    of unquantified rhetoric.<br>
2:  Passivity has consequences.<br>
<p>
A third thing that we might recognize relates to<br>
misunderstandings, on the part of probably most people in just<br>
about any contemporary society you might mention, about how<br>
science works.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br>
