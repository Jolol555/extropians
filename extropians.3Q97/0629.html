<i>&gt;Date: Thu, 17 Jul 97 11:41:51 CST</i><br>
<i>&gt;From: "Rick Knight" &lt;rknight@platinum.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To: extropians@extropy.org</i><br>
<i>&gt;Subject: Fact or Fiction...Good reading!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Recently there have been some subjects that have popped up of </i><br>
<i>&gt;     questionable, genuine scientific value (Roswell, pole shifting, </i><br>
and <br>
<i>&gt;     maybe psychedelic-driven evolution).  It's intriguing to see the </i><br>
<i>&gt;     rather intense reactions from the more academic members who wish </i><br>
not <br>
<i>&gt;     to have the sanctity of their digest polluted with unproven or </i><br>
highly <br>
<i>&gt;     improbable subjects.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     What's fascinating is the *effect* these discussions have.  One </i><br>
<i>&gt;     reader, upon visiting the pole shift web sites declared "Aw shit!" </i><br>
(as <br>
<i>&gt;     if he was already committed to his cryonics agreement but fat lot </i><br>
of <br>
<i>&gt;     good it was gonna do him now because a world calamity is due by </i><br>
<i>&gt;     century's end),  While the mental tug of war about the physics </i><br>
versus <br>
<i>&gt;     the circumstancial evidence plays out, some go into flame mode at </i><br>
<i>&gt;     having to be subjected to drivel, others wax mildly concerned </i><br>
about <br>
<i>&gt;     the possibility of such a thing occurring.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     There is pre-millenial fever brewing in us all but isn't the </i><br>
current <br>
<i>&gt;     time frame our own invention?  2000 means something because </i><br>
somewhere <br>
<i>&gt;     way back when, we decided it did.  Does 2000 mean anything to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Orthodox Jew or the Chinese?  Or maybe it's because 2000 is the </i><br>
mark <br>
<i>&gt;     of a dominant world culture that makes it more special.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Sure, it'd be nice for something a little novel to occur.  I was </i><br>
in <br>
<i>&gt;     tears watching Contact just because it connected with the </i><br>
childhood <br>
<i>&gt;     pain I felt of not belonging on this pretty fucked-up planet, </i><br>
<i>&gt;     beautiful and pristine as it can be at times.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Hypothetically, if the evidence started pouring in, the pole shift </i><br>
is <br>
<i>&gt;     a definite, I wonder what actions the devoted Extropian might </i><br>
pursue <br>
<i>&gt;     in increasing the assurance that s/he won't be crushed, drowned, </i><br>
<i>&gt;     incinerated etc.. Entertain this notion if you will, suppose you </i><br>
have <br>
<i>&gt;     a little less than 3 years before it's "the end of the world as we </i><br>
<i>&gt;     know it".  What's your plan of action?</i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Hypothetically, all the scientific lack of substantiation aside, </i><br>
what <br>
<i>&gt;     if aliens crashed in New Mexico 50 years ago and the government </i><br>
knows <br>
<i>&gt;     about it.  How does that alter your perception?</i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     If psychedelics open up a conduit in your chemical makeup to </i><br>
receive <br>
<i>&gt;     information from another dimension (yes, I'm introducing this </i><br>
concept <br>
<i>&gt;     that has heretofore not been mentioned), what of that?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     So much thrashing about on the details, the facts, the proof or </i><br>
lack <br>
<i>&gt;     thereof.  You may ask, do I *believe* in Roswell?  When I was </i><br>
younger <br>
<i>&gt;     I liked the idea.  The details are so pureed though, who could </i><br>
tell <br>
<i>&gt;     and who has TIME to dig that deep when ultimately you have to make </i><br>
a <br>
<i>&gt;     decision on faith (or as one reader said about pole shifting </i><br>
"belief <br>
<i>&gt;     bias").</i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     It's a security-based phenomenon to focus one's attention on </i><br>
empirical <br>
<i>&gt;     proof so one doesn't have to deal with the emotions of what to </i><br>
make of <br>
<i>&gt;     the unknowns.  You can keep it all left-brained and quite tidy.  </i><br>
If <br>
<i>&gt;     that doesn't work, you can make some intelligible static as you </i><br>
look <br>
<i>&gt;     down your nose at the quaint naive ones who have dashed the other </i><br>
way <br>
<i>&gt;     like Chicken Little running around in hysteria that the sky is </i><br>
going <br>
<i>&gt;     to fall (or the pole is going to shift &lt;G&gt;).  </i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     These tabloid-worthy stories are myths but I don't regard them as </i><br>
such <br>
<i>&gt;     to dismiss them.  Myths are valuable.  Their archetypal impact </i><br>
brings <br>
<i>&gt;     out a wide range of emotion and it's quite interesting to observe </i><br>
that <br>
<i>&gt;     in others and in ourselves.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     I'm certainly not advocating that the scientifically-minded spend </i><br>
<i>&gt;     overt amounts of time mollycoddling the more impulsive members of </i><br>
this <br>
<i>&gt;     digest.  I am suggesting that when someone brings up something </i><br>
that <br>
<i>&gt;     occurs for you like a matador's cape to a bull, you might want to </i><br>
<i>&gt;     drill down into what's triggering the response of judging, </i><br>
controlling <br>
<i>&gt;     and flaming.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Personally, I like the fact that this digest covers the map from </i><br>
the <br>
<i>&gt;     viability of food replicators to ancient evidence of Atlantis </i><br>
BEING <br>
<i>&gt;     Antarctica (that's where that thread could possibly go..).  It's </i><br>
<i>&gt;     entertainment and as memes go, it's a nice distraction, sometimes </i><br>
a <br>
<i>&gt;     thought-provoking one.  And of course, it doesn't take much </i><br>
reading <br>
<i>&gt;     between the lines to see that my red flag is control-meisters who </i><br>
want <br>
<i>&gt;     to get the Animaniacs out of the studio lot (sorry, I have to plug </i><br>
<i>&gt;     those guys at least once).</i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Lightly,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Rick</i><br>
