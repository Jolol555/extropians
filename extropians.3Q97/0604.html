<i>&gt; But I still don't like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; inconsistencies that debunkers continue to ignore, and rely on gov't</i><br>
<i>&gt; assertions contrary to truth, and evidence of records tampering and</i><br>
<i>&gt; descruction. </i><br>
<p>
Personally I don't like the way that believers ignore the very plain fact<br>
that all contemporary accounts match that of a Mogul balloon and these<br>
accounts weren't challenged until a third of a century later. Or do you<br>
really believe that alien spacecraft are held together with scotch tape? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nope, it was a report by a soldier who claimed to be at the crash site</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the full vehicle, not the Brazel ranch.</i><br>
<p>
Again, if the saucer didn't exist then such reports don't matter. I mean, <br>
I could claim to have been at the crash site and been temporally <br>
distorted to the 1990s, but it wouldn't make it true.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If its all cultural related to current scifi literature projections of</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology, where are the cyber abductions? Where are the "I was</i><br>
<i>&gt; uploaded by an alien" stories?</i><br>
<p>
How often do you see those on Star Trek? They haven't yet filtered down <br>
into popular culture.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The reports I've seen said that the materials, when looked at under a</i><br>
<i>&gt; microscope, looked like they were made up of bazillions of microscopic</i><br>
<i>&gt; welds.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This would necessitate a welding machine the size of bacteria, eh?</i><br>
<p>
Possibly, but why should anyone believe the reports? And why would anyone <br>
with the ability to build such a machine bother with 'welding'? Why not <br>
just stick it together atom by atom to produce a perfect surface?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Corso was at the base at the time. This is known.</i><br>
<p>
Interesting; evidence?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You forget the bureaucratic machine. Don't have something on base?</i><br>
<i>&gt; where's the right contractor? From what I've seen of Area 51, its all</i><br>
<i>&gt; contractor run. From my own experience on many bases, most of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; logisitics stuff is handled by civilians and contractors.</i><br>
<p>
And you think that such an organisation could keep this 'crashed alien<br>
spacecraft' a secret for thirty-three years? Why is ignoring these<br>
inconsistencies bad for 'debunkers', but fine for believers? <br>
<p>
Anyway, if this mortician is the same one mentioned at www.roswell.org<br>
then his testimony is extremely suspect. That guy supposedly stated that<br>
he visited the base with a nurse, and gave her name. That nurse isn't<br>
mentioned in any contemporary records. When told this, our first-hand<br>
witness admitted that yes, actually that wasn't her real name, and he<br>
wouldn't give that out. Yeah, right. See the kind of people believers rely<br>
on for their stories? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The photos released were several days later, after Gen Ramey had put the</i><br>
<i>&gt; cover story in place. Considering that weather balloons were heavily</i><br>
<i>&gt; used by the weather people on base, gussying up something in a day or so</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be rather easy.</i><br>
<p>
So. You have evidence that anything was substituted? *Marcel says that the<br>
photo is genuine*. You disbelieve your prime witness? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; According to Brazel, the eve before he initially found the scattered</i><br>
<i>&gt; peices (June 15th), he and his family experienced a huge explosive</i><br>
<i>&gt; sound, louder in his opinion than the lightning that was common on</i><br>
<i>&gt; summer evenings in that area.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, do you have a source for this?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But the mogul project was BASED at Roswell. If anyone knew what a Mogul</i><br>
<i>&gt; balloon was, it would have been the people at Roswell field.</i><br>
<p>
Alamogordo. Sorry. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anyways, outside of the radio reciever, the mogul balloon was exactly</i><br>
<i>&gt; like a normal weather balloon. The radar reflectors were for radar</i><br>
<i>&gt; tracking of the balloon.</i><br>
<p>
Well, according to the Sceptical Enquirer:<br>
<p>
"While many UFO proponents claim the wreckage shown in General Ramey's<br>
office was just a weather balloon switched for the "real debris," Moore<br>
pointed out that the radar targets used by NYU were unlike anything flown<br>
in New Mexico before and that "they were not available in Fort Worth to be<br>
substituted for the debris in General Ramey's office." Warrant Officer<br>
Newton was able to recognize the debris in General Ramey's office because<br>
he happened to have used an early version of the same targets while<br>
serving as a weatherman in Okinawa. The earlier-model targets Newton used<br>
did not have the reinforcing tape with the pinkish-purple flower designs." <br>
<p>
But I guess Moore (one of the Project Mogul scientists) is just part of the <br>
government coverup, right?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; According to the story, the larger wreckage was found several days or</i><br>
<i>&gt; weeks later, once the story was clamped on.</i><br>
<p>
Again, a story which didn't appear until over a third of a century later. <br>
No-one has so far managed to produce any published account of a crashed<br>
alien spacecraft at Roswell prior to "The Roswell Incident", which itself<br>
only included second-hand accounts. <br>
