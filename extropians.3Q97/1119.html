Sure; I think her writing is over the top and motivated largely by her<br>
desire to be recognized as a genius. However, I think the basic idea is<br>
sound and it's a fun rant. Of course she's British, so it may well be more<br>
valid in British society than others. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is not obvious to me, for example,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that people want to ignore reality,</i><br>
<p>
Well I think that one look at the turnover of the movie, TV and publishing<br>
industry would make that clear... but her main idea is that the human race<br>
values other people far more than knowledge about reality; most people<br>
would rather be alpha-human in their little social group than learn and<br>
create, and that even most of those who start out desiring to do the<br>
opposite learn in time to follow the crowd. In my experience this is<br>
generally true. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; that efficiency precludes</i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting emotions,</i><br>
<p>
She's not saying that, exactly; as I read her she means that sane people<br>
would rather be able to say that they really want to do something but that<br>
they can't do it because society prevents them, than to actually go out<br>
and do it, and risk failing in the process. Again I'd say this is<br>
generally true in British society but less so in American.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; or that sane society is boring. </i><br>
<p>
Try living in a socialist country for a while... or at least a more<br>
socialist country than America.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And I find the</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea that wars are made to divert people from research rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; implausible. </i><br>
<p>
Hmm, I think it's somewhat implausible but wars have often seemed to be<br>
fought to take people's minds off of reality. For example the Falklands or<br>
the Gulf War, both of which greatly improved the politicians' popularity<br>
because people were able to forget just how bad they were doing at home. <br>

P.S. I'm off to Canada for a week or so, and my laptop's staying at home<br>
this time so I won't be able to answer any mail for a while.<br>
