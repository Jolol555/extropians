I thought I'd wait a little while until the expected replies to my post had <br>
drop on to the list before replying to them all at once.<br>
<p>
Daniel Lee Crocker:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If a person is mentally competent to engage in ordinary contracts, can</i><br>
<i>&gt;hold a job, make decisions such concerning sexual relations, other</i><br>
<i>&gt;medical procedures, and other important aspects of life, then any law</i><br>
<i>&gt;or professional "standard" that interferes with that individual's</i><br>
<i>&gt;decision is repugnant to individual sovereignty.</i><br>
<p>
Your conditional clause mimics closely two caveats of my own, in my post:<br>
"given ...the fact that many people asking for it [surgery] have other<br>
psychological problems" and "many such people are not in a suitable mental<br>
state to take such a decision". The medical role here is not to decide<br>
whether or not an individual can take the decision to have surgery, but to<br>
decide whether or not that individual is competent to take such a decision<br>
in an informed, rational and considered way. So your argument in the above<br>
paragraph does not differ from mine, except in one respect. Whilst you<br>
simply introduce an introductory condition clause relating to the abilities<br>
of the individual, I introduce the members of the medical profession as the<br>
people best equipped to decide the applicability of that clause to an<br>
individual. Would you allow the individual to decide mental competency? In<br>
which case (a) you'd probably not get very many people deciding they were<br>
not competent and (b) would you expect any doctor/surgeon simply to ask the<br>
question, "Are you mentally OK?" and believe any answer they received<br>
irrespective of any contraindications?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Medicine is just a product</i><br>
<i>&gt;like any other, and the doctor provides that product at my request and</i><br>
<i>&gt;for my payment.</i><br>
<p>
Except of course when your are in ER, comatose and bleeding to death, when<br>
the product (service) is not at your explicit request. Or in a system such<br>
as the UK has (although one could argue the same to a degree with an<br>
insurance scheme) where it isn't your payment. That is, "Medicine is a<br>
product like any other, except that I might not say I want it and other<br>
people might pay for it."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Well if I want</i><br>
<i>&gt;green tile in my kitchen, I'm not going to listen to some builder</i><br>
<i>&gt;telling me I'm not capable of that decision.  Why should I tolerate</i><br>
<i>&gt;the same arrogance from a doctor or lawyer?</i><br>
<p>
That argument ad absurdum is not a very apposite analogy. Suppose you<br>
wanted to knock a door through a wall. You talk to a builder, who knows<br>
about such things in far more depth than do you, and she tells you that it<br>
would be wise to take the time to do a full survey of the house to find out<br>
if the door would cause it to collapse or not; she herself, being able to<br>
analyse the survey in ways you cannot, would interpret the results of the<br>
survey to let you know the answer. But no! you can take this decision<br>
yourself; you don't need her to take it for you; so you tell her to get on<br>
with it, and your house falls down.<br>
<p>
Besides, even mine is not a good analogy. Because in the subject about<br>
which we are talking you are in effect asking people to assess their own<br>
mental state. Is that viable? Or would you argue that, viable or not,<br>
people should be allowed to take their own decisions; an argument which<br>
effectively removes the conditional clause from your first paragraph.<br>
<p>
Another thing worth noting is part of my orginal posting which you elided:<br>
"Perhaps this [the role of the medical profession] [is] a moral issue which<br>
will have to be faced in an individual basis for each possible modification<br>
as the technology we so-often discuss becomes available..."<br>
<p>
Nanotech would probably make all of this reversible, and one would then be<br>
in a position where an individual could try out the physical change and<br>
then reverse it if depression, suicidal-tendencies, psychosis, or whatever<br>
started to make themselves apparent. (Still, one could ask, could the<br>
individual spot those things in himself, or would he require monitoring<br>
over a 'test' period?)<br>
<p>
<p>
Kathryn Aegis:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My one small addition is that the temporary or permanent nature of a </i><br>
<i>&gt;biological change should not be read as an indication of the seriousness </i><br>
<i>&gt;of that decision for the person involved.</i><br>
<p>
My orginal post, of course, used the phrase "severity and irreversibility"<br>
in recognition of this.<br>
<p>
Although, the temporary or permanent nature of the change is a factor in<br>
the seriousness of the decision. An obvious example is the difference<br>
between, "Want to know what it is like to be dead?", and "Want to know what<br>
it is like to be dead for a minute and then revived using this new, tried<br>
and tested technology?" I can imagine the answers being different for some<br>
people. There must be many more, everyday examples of the irreversability<br>
of a decision changing its seriousness. One that springs to mind is, "I'm<br>
don't think I'm happy in this relationship but if I leave her to find out<br>
whether or not I'm then happier I know I'll never get her back." The<br>
irreversability of the decision to leave effects its seriousness.<br>
<p>
But, whatever, "severity and irreversability" was my original phrase.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The very notion of choice, </i><br>
<i>&gt;of making an active decision about one's own biology or sex role, </i><br>
<i>&gt;challenges the base power structures of human society.</i><br>
<p>
Indeed. As well as challenging its base morality, ethics, socio-economic<br>
distinctions...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Taking on those </i><br>
<i>&gt;encoded norms by refusing to stay in one gender, however it is done--</i><br>
<i>&gt;through semipermanent hormones, permanent surgery, or temporary </i><br>
<i>&gt;cosmetic alteration--carries the same societal consequences for the </i><br>
<i>&gt;individual.</i><br>
<p>
But not the same psychological consequences; nor, for each individuals,<br>
will those societal or psychological consequences be the same. In fact, on<br>
reflection, the three types of modification you mention do not even carry<br>
the same societal consequences, since within societal interaction one has<br>
to include intimate contact.<br>
<p>
Further, you don't say what those societal consequences might be:<br>
ostracization, loss of employment, public ridicule, etc. And these things<br>
can have deep psychological effects: depression, suicidal tendencies, etc.<br>
At the end of the day a major function of gender expression must be<br>
internal happiness: if that is outweighed by the unhappiness caused by<br>
society it seems reasonable that some people will choose to limit their<br>
times and modes of non-'standard' gender expression to reach their optimal<br>
state of happiness. Fine: unless the first time they realize their<br>
depression, realize they are now more unhappy and wish to modify their<br>
gender expression, is after they've had an instant, irreversible operation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The medical profession carries a vested interest in </i><br>
<i>&gt;preserving the binary sex system and, therefore, in its role as </i><br>
<i>&gt;gatekeeper will try to weed out those who would practice some </i><br>
<i>&gt;flexibility.</i><br>
<p>
Well, in the case of the female to male change, doctors are quite prepared<br>
to condone bi-lateral mastectomies and hormonal changes, without requiring<br>
phalloplasty. Equally, breast implants are available to individuals who do<br>
not intend to have vaginoplasty, etc.<br>
<p>
Do you have a specific example in mind?<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
There seems to be the view that the medical profession are 'the enemy' in<br>
this case. Why so? Doctors don't seem to be the enemy when it comes to<br>
things like removing tumours, clearing up infections, setting broken limbs.<br>
Yet, in all these cases there is an element of observation on the part of<br>
the doctor: the biopsy, the swab and culture, the x-ray. Is it not possible<br>
that the psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors and surgeons involved in the<br>
sex change process are there to help; to clarify intentions, point out<br>
potential problems, act as shoulder to cry on, ensure hormones aren't<br>
causing endocrinological damage, etc.<br>
