<i>&gt; You reckon that abolishing money is easier than abolishing trade barriers?</i><br>
<p>
Absolutely.  Trade barriers are powered by xenophobia, fear, misunderstanding,<br>
and have powerful lobbyists who receive the focused benefits.  Abolishing<br>
trade barriers, on a global basis, in a frontal attack, would require<br>
political forces of apocalyptic improbability.<br>
<p>
Everybody takes money for granted, but nobody has any real emotional<br>
investment in money as opposed to barter.  Social inertia isn't exactly easy,<br>
but it can still be overcome, especially when the old way is obsoleted rather<br>
than attacked.  Find and promote a few political/memetic riders on complex<br>
barter, make sure it has an understandable interface, and barter would be more<br>
than politically feasible.<br>
