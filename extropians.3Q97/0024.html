Mike Lorrey reports--<br>
: Concluding their 1997 term, the Supreme Court Justices ruled 5-4 in<br>
: favor of states rights proponents and against the Federal Brady Law.<br>
: They ruled that federal law cannot commandeer the resources and time of<br>
: state officials without compensation to administer the requirements of<br>
: federal regulation. It is a usurpation of states 10th Amendment rights.<br>
<p>
That's a bit odd, since the Federalist Papers predicted that Federal acts<br>
would be enforced mostly by state and local officers.  There are other<br>
Tenth Amendment grounds for killing the Brady Act!<br>
<p>
Now, if only they'd recognize that commandeering the resources and time<br>
of private parties is also an usurpation of our Fifth Amendment rights.<br>
<p>
: Given that state and local officials will no longer be administrating<br>
: the law, the feds are now forced to move forward with the InstaCheck<br>
: program, which is a nationwide database of criminals who are barred<br>
: from purchasing guns.<br>
<p>
Does this mean every gun shop has to buy a terminal, or what?<br>
<p>
: What remains is that a watchdog organization be given oversight to the<br>
: Instacheck program to ensure that this system is not used to collect<br>
: information on the gun buying habits of law abiding citizens.<br>
<p>
They'd never do that - it's illegal!<br>
