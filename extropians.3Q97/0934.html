Are there any books which do describe this well?  If not, maybe you<br>
should write one.  Academics can hardly be expected to put in forty<br>
years like you did before they analyze things.  So its up to people<br>
like you to set them straight.  <br>
<p>
I am especially interested in this issue because there's a good chance<br>
I'll be a professor of political science within the next two years.<br>

Dear Robin and other fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
If you wish you may consult the MACMILLAN ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE<br>
FUTURE as one of many sources of information. Hopefully, it can be found<br>
in your friendly neighborhood university library.<br>
<p>
Please try to avoid going to sleep while reading my contributions to this<br>
two volume set.<br>
<p>
If you wish I will be happy to provide you with a listing of other<br>
published materials.<br>
<p>
Enjoy!!! <br>
