Yes, I think this is the right interpretation.  I don't think the nanotech<br>
in the book is capable of self-replication.  The reasons are not very<br>
clear, but perhaps it is in part due to some technical difficulty (hard<br>
to understand what, though), and in part it is pretty clear for political<br>
reasons.  The range of designs which can be built from the Feed is limited,<br>
and this gives the suppliers of the Feed political influence and control.<br>
So they have little incentive to try to develop self-replication.<br>
<p>
Instead, an underground research project is implemented, using some kind<br>
of bizarre mix of nanotech and biology, sex as computation.  This is an<br>
effort to generate the Seed, an alternative which will free the world<br>
from dependence on the Feed.  The Seed is self-replicating, able to grow<br>
using available environmental resources.<br>
