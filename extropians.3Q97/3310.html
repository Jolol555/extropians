Yes, religion and pseudoscience are both examples of belief<br>
structures, but we anre now intreested in the nature of belief<br>
structures. In fact there is a large amount of philisophical<br>
analysis of this ("True Believers" by Hoffer). There is also<br>
quite a bit of current scientific research by people<br>
like Susan Blackmore. This is very relevant to discussions<br>
about the continuity of an uploaded personality. There are<br>
many who assert that continuity of memory or consistency of<br>
memory are important attributes of "self". However, human<br>
memory is quite malleable. We apparently reconstruct our memories<br>
continuosly, and it's quite easy to impart a false memory.<br>
This is spooky stuff. Your belief structure acts as a filter<br>
as you interpret your sensory inputs, and then acts as an<br>
editor as you reconstruct an event when you recall it.<br>
