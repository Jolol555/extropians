Dear Associates on list extropians,<br>
<p>
It would appear that Mr. F. Mann's promising debate on the Neuro-Semantic<br>
Political Illusion Complex (NSPIC) is attracting the same kinds of flak from<br>
Big Brothers intellectual gladiators as was received by a similar new<br>
enterprise started about one year ago by Eberhard E. H. Weber.  My thoughts<br>
at that time were astonishment at the vicious opposition to open debate, and<br>
concern that we may be, as a nation, too far under the Neuro-Semantic<br>
Political Illusion Complex to save our selves by means of open public debate.<br>
 In that case, we will get a Master.<br>
<p>
Here is the best face I could put on the problem a year ago.<br>
WesBurt <br>

Subj.    The Common Public Interest<br>
Date:	97-01-15 15:40:52 EST<br>
From:	WesBurt<br>
<p>
Dear Subscribers to List &lt;ws1@mundicausa.org&gt; and others:<br>
<p>
<p>
In the four days since the list owner and founder, Eberhard E. H. Weber, <br>
distributed the kick-off essay for this workshop on Sat. Jan. 11, 1997, we <br>
have been treated to an impressive demonstration of how public opinion can<br>
be directed toward preserving the status quo and away from all constructive<br>
 dialog on essential corrective actions.  In other words, we are watching a <br>
demonstration of how to "divide and conquer" a nation.<br>
<p>
There has been a torrent of high noise level mail to the list on two topics, <br>
and both topics force the reader to torture his imagination to find any<br>
 relation between either topic and the purpose of Mr. Weber's essay, <br>
INFRA-HUMAN DETERMINANTS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR.<br>
<p>
Topic # 1, <br>
Mail asking to be removed from list &lt;ws1@mundicausa.org&gt; seems to have <br>
no other purpose than to persuade the watching public that the list owner is <br>
a questionable character who has packed his distribution list with addresses <br>
purchased from some direct-e-mail sales organization.  Those unfortunate, <br>
with too little intellectual curiosity to watch the start-up of a new<br>
enterprise for <br>
a few days, should consider the words of Oliver Cromwell to his opponents: <br>
<p>
"I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, consider that you may be mistaken."<br>
<p>
  And then, if they are still certain that they subscribed to this list by<br>
mistake, <br>
they could push their DELETE buttons until they learn how to unsubscribe, <br>
instead of mucking up the mailboxes of all other subscribers who knew what <br>
they were doing when they signed on.<br>
<p>
Topic # 2,<br>
Mail, "Re: Option Space concept expanded," that mentions the NASA space<br>
 program as a potential cure for our social pathology, seems to have no other<br>
<p>
purpose than to divert public attention away from the purpose of list <br>
&lt;ws1@mundicausa.org&gt; and away from the goals of the four day old <br>
kick-off essay.<br>
<p>
As I read that kick-off essay, it seemed to me that the author had leaned<br>
over <br>
backward to withhold his own ideas, and offer his subscribers a clean<br>
framework<br>
 for dialog in which every avenue of approach to the subject was wide open.  <br>
The author of every new enterprise must keep a sharp eye out for signs of the<br>
Not-Invented-Here (NIH) syndrome among his sponsors, employees, and <br>
customers.  But somewhere, sometime, somebody must propose a direction, <br>
even a mistaken direction is soon corrected, in which the enterprise must<br>
move<br>
in order to discover the common interest of the public and the enterprise.<br>
<p>
If the goals of this list are to be realized, the active contributors cannot,<br>
like <br>
the President's just concluded Commission On Social Security, propose three<br>
 solutions for correcting the one defect in our social order.  The two<br>
workshops <br>
that are running concurrently, as they approach the top of the mountain from <br>
opposite directions and come into view of the other group, must resist the<br>
temptation to shoot at their opposite members in the other workshop.  There<br>
is <br>
only one top to this mountain, and none of us will reach it, unless we see <br>
the top as a broad level playing field, big enough for all.<br>
<p>
Two questions popped into my mind over the last four days as I re-read <br>
the various literature from the MUNDI CAUSA SOCIETY:<br>
<p>
!, What are the significant advantages of using two task forces, two <br>
commissions, two workshops to solve one problem?<br>
<p>
2, Is there an advantage to developing a model for general equilibrium using <br>
negative feedback, another model for the existing compulsive expansion <br>
mode of the economy using positive feedback, and additional models for <br>
different nations according to their unique attributes.  Such an unlikely <br>
economic expert as Pope John Paul II suggested that there is only one <br>
model, for every place and time, when he wrote on page 83 of CENTESIMUS <br>
ANNUS (on the hundredth anniversary of RERUM NOVARUM):<br>
<p>
"A business cannot be considered only as a "society of capital goods"; it is <br>
also a "society of persons" in which people participate in different ways and<br>
with specific responsibilities, whether they supply the necessary capital for<br>
 the company's activities or take part in such activities through their<br>
labor."<br>
<p>
As a Protestant, my "need to know" takes me wherever the evidence leads, <br>
so I am perfectly free to read Pope John Paul II's Catholic Literature, if<br>
his <br>
writings address my interests, which they do in this case!<br>
<p>
Let me restate the second question.  Could we save some time and labor by <br>
looking at only one model?  That is, a model like John Paul II's that could <br>
move over the whole continuum, from equilibrium to the current Rat Race, <br>
when the levels and polarity of feedback are taken as the independent <br>
variables of the model?<br>
<p>
If such a simple model catches the public's attention, those who oppose the <br>
public interest in every shape or form will have to do the heavy lifting on <br>
Public Policy from then on.  No more "free lunch" for them.<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
<p>
WesBurt<br>
