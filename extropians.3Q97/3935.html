Eliezer writes<br>
: I've been convinced that drugs are evil. ... if I go after drugs<br>
: it will be with bioengineered viruses, not guns and policemen and<br>
: warrantless searches.<br>
<p>
So ... your holy plague wipes out the coca plant; beneficial uses of<br>
coca cease (are coca extracts still used in medicine, or are Novocaine<br>
and Procaine wholly synthetic?); and some genius on the Dark Side of<br>
the bio-Force cooks up a new drug, which might be less benign than<br>
crack but that doesn't matter; what counts is that it is not vulnerable<br>
to your anti-coca.  Now what?<br>
<p>
Have you any comment on the idea that crack is a product of prohibition?<br>
Smugglers want a high potency/volume ratio; also, if users have limited<br>
opportunities to get their hit (unlike drinkers who can buy their drug<br>
anywhere and openly extend their intake over a whole evening) they want<br>
that rare hit to be stronger than beer.<br>
<p>
: Nor would I ever attempt to stop (via force), say, David<br>
: Pearce from taking drugs - his ethical system says it's okay,<br>
: and I respect that.  But it has to stop.  Have you ever read<br>
: O'Rourke's description of a crack neighborhood?  It reads like a<br>
: description of Hell.<br>
<p>
Ever heard of Demon Rum?<br>
<p>
What's the difference between David Pearce (who?) and a ghetto user?<br>
<p>
(a bunch of irrelevant metaphors snipped)<br>
