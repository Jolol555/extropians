  Is there a mailing list or other forum just for extropians?  Perry's<br>
words reflect my sentiments.  I still remember my first day on the<br>
extropian newsgroup:  I had finally found my philosophy etched (typed)<br>
by the hands of another.  But it soon became obvious that the newsgroup<br>
was cluttered by coercivists and stagnantites (too blind or fearful of<br>
our self-improvement).  I asked if there was a more extropian forum and<br>
was led to this mailing list.<br>
  The mailing list is a vast improvement over the newsgroup but, with<br>
the combination of increased traffic on the list and less leisure time<br>
on my hands, I find myself yearning for a more focused forum.<br>
  The difficulty (for me) is in trying to avoid the standard "freedom is<br>
wrong/impossible" arguments generated by statists while still being sure<br>
that I am receiving all the worthy postings.  Obviously this is very<br>
subjective.<br>
  I guess I am not saying anything new here but if there is another<br>
forum, I'd would appreciate receiving info on it.  If not, I'll just<br>
continue on this list.<br>
  Thanks.<br>
