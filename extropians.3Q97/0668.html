<i>&gt; By "random" you seem to mean "diverse," sort of.  Surely the ideas</i><br>

<p>
"Random" might have been a non-optimal word to describe what I meant.<br>
You are of course right in that our experiences are not random<br>
(otherwise we would not be able to learn anything; and if they were<br>
completely ordered we would quickly learn the rules and never have to<br>
learn after childhood); but most of the experiences we learn from<br>
have not been planned as learning experiences, and might not even be<br>
good learning experiences (making a simple mistake when driving can<br>
be fatal).  Hence the interest in better ways of growth. A better<br>
word may be "unplanned" experiences. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anyway, I'm not sure any systematic approaches are more reliable than,</i><br>

<i>&gt; the Prussian-developed schools we have, or initiation rites either,</i><br>

<p>
Schools may be good or bad in different respects (and not all of them<br>
are Prussian either, although new forms of learning are needed) but<br>
they certainly help us learn a lot of things that would be very<br>
costly to learn on our own (like reading or writing or basic<br>
physics). A good education can teach us things we would have needed<br>
decades to learn on our own. The problem is that (by definition) they<br>
are best at transmitting academic knowledge and not other important<br>
aspects of human growth. <br>
