     Daniel Quinn in the book "Ishmael")<br>
     <br>
      I would regard a third world shepherd as a leaver, a western world<br>
      rancher as a taker.  The distinction being on their overall impact on<br>
      the world at large.  The shepherd's flock might eat up the grass in a<br>
      meadow which locally may locally impact the population but a modern<br>
     cattle facility can spoil groundwater and produce over abundant <br>
     amounts of methane, not to mention how much grain it takes to feed the<br>
     cattle that one doesn't get back nutritionally or substantively in t=<br>
     he resultant meat or dairy consumption for which the cattle are <br>
     raised.<br>
     <br>
     Anton Sherwood replied (no &lt;G&gt;s so I'll have to assume <br>
     tongue-in-cheek):<br>
     <br>
     Your low-impact shepherds stripped the Mediterranean of its trees<br>
     and enlarged the Sahara.<br>
     <br>
     and I am compelled to respond:<br>
     <br>
     Regarding "my" shepherds, do you have any data on how many centuries <br>
     it took for their systematic devistation to take place?  If this data <br>
     exists, could you provide me with a correlation on their environmental <br>
     impact vs. the U.S. environmental impact in the last, say, 100 years.  <br>
     Yeah, those shepherds, a swarm of locusts they were.  And look, &lt;G&gt;.<br>
     <br>
     Leaver cultures screw up environmental balance quite often but it is <br>
     not planetary in impact.  When they (or their herds) consume all that <br>
     is available, it has a direct effect on population since they have <br>
     impacted their own sustainability.  But because of their limited <br>
     scope, they presumably do it unintentionally because their focus is on <br>
     day-to-day survival.<br>
     <br>
     Correlation: the first banks stored grain because somewhere along the <br>
     line someone figured we didn't have quite enough foresight to control <br>
     our consumption.  Of course we were good at burning and pillaging back <br>
     then as well.  The idea to store grain (the gold seed turned into the <br>
     gold coin) was a good one but the incorporation of which  has created <br>
     a much more severe measure of imbalance and one that has a viable <br>
     global threat attached to it.  <br>
     <br>
     Since we've evolved beyond what nature intends as keeping a balance on <br>
     population (you eat it all at once or there are too many of you, you <br>
     starve), I am hoping we can swing the pendulum a bit back towards <br>
     center.  We've ensured our survival against need but can we guarantee <br>
     our survival against greed? We have the technology, the intelligence <br>
     and the organizational structure to implement such a paradigm but our <br>
     greed and ego seem to be hell-bent on prevailing.  Looks like there is <br>
     still some evolving to do...<br>
     <br>
