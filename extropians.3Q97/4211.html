Upon reading the Neo-Tech  literature ["Neo-Tech" stands for <br>
"fully-integrated honesty"], one find statements claiming Frank R. <br>
Wallace [the founder of "Neo-Tech"] is descended from "William Wallace". <br>
Those who watched the movie "Braveheart" realize that Wallace was a <br>
"freedom fighter" who saw through "Longshanks" masquerade and fought <br>
against his tyranny.<br>
<p>
The nub of it is that the Neo-Tech literature also reveals that Frank R. <br>
Wallace is *a pen name*. He was trying to gain unearned respectability <br>
for his literature by falsely *branding* himself as  a descendent of <br>
"Braveheart", much the same way as "royalty" attempt to gain unearned <br>
respectability by *branding* themselves as descendants of prior fools <br>
and impostors who masqueraded around as "royalty".<br>
<p>
So much for "fully integrated honesty", eh? Although the NT literature <br>
has a lot of profound information, there is also a lot of bunk one must <br>
weed through.<br>
<p>
Braveheart also realized the claim of everyone who resided in Longshanks <br>
"territory" were his subjects by default was a farce. He argued that <br>
since he NEVER sworn allegiance to "Longshanks", he could not be his <br>
"subject". As Spooner stated in chapter 18 of "No Treason No. VI: The <br>
Constitution of No Authority" <br>
[<a href="http://www.creative.net/~star/notrsn6.htm">http://www.creative.net/~star/notrsn6.htm</a>]:<br>
<p>
 "Thus it is evident that all these men, who call themselves by the <br>
high-sounding names of Emperors, Kings, Sovereigns, Monarchs, Most <br>
Christian Majesties, Most Catholic  Majesties, High Mightinesses, Most <br>
Serene and Potent Princes, and the like, and who claim to rule "by the <br>
grace of God," by "Divine Right"---that is, by special authority from <br>
Heaven---are intrinsically not only the merest miscreants and wretches, <br>
engaged solely in plundering, enslaving, and murdering their fellow men. <br>
. ."<br>
<p>
They are merely, ". . .despicable creatures, who call themselves <br>
emperors, and kings, and majesties, and most serene and potent princes; <br>
who profess to wear crowns, and sit on thrones; who deck themselves with <br>
ribbons, and feathers, and jewels; and surround themselves with hired <br>
flatterers and lickspittles; and whom we suffer to strut around, and <br>
palm themselves off upon fools and slaves <br>
[<a href="http://www.netcom.com/~zeno7/gratslav.html">http://www.netcom.com/~zeno7/gratslav.html</a>] as sovereigns and lawgivers <br>
specially appointed by Almighty God; and to hold themselves out as the <br>
sole fountains of honors, and dignities, and wealth, and power---all <br>
these miscreants and impostors know that. . ." as soon as the masses see <br>
through their *brand* they, ". . .will unmake them, strip them of their <br>
gewgaws, and send them out into the world as beggars, or give them over <br>
to the vengeance of the people they have enslaved. . ."<br>
