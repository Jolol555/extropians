<p>
You don't, they didn't, you haven't, and you need not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;I was speaking of seeing it in the morning newspapers, not seeing it in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;person.  More on this a bit later, I'm developing a theory here...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Can't wait! ;-)</i><br>
<p>
The theory is one of those things that sound ludicrously obvious in retrospect<br>
- that the emotions invoked by an event depend on whether we read it, see<br>
it on TV, visit it in person, or experience it from the victim, attacker and<br>
bystander point of view.  The idea is that regardless of the relative<br>
horribleness in ultimate ethical terms, and regardless of the relative<br>
horribleness when visited in person or viewed as a victim, the way the Nazis<br>
ran the Holocaust was the first (only?) genocide that was (1) documented and<br>
(2) came across through the documents.  Thus it was the origin of the<br>
anti-genocide taboo.<br>
<p>
Perhaps the Holocaust has been the only noticed and publicized genocide since<br>
then because it was the first genocide to arrive in the time of movies, and<br>
the first genocide committed by an unpopular defeated enemy.  At the time,<br>
there was no taboo against genocide and everyone's defenses were down.  After<br>
that, the taboo went into effect and all the newspapers couldn't print it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes, in practice we're saying *basically* the same thing. We just arrived</i><br>
<i>&gt; at our opinions via different paths. Then when 'discussion' becomes</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'argument' (why is that? hormones?) and all sorts of emotions kick-in</i><br>
<i>&gt; things become very clouded.</i><br>
<p>
Evolutionary psychology.  Losers of arguments often lose mating privileges.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;I'll handle the ghettos if you handle Cambodia. Deal?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Deal. As long as we can exchange knowledge &amp; experience on a weekly basis</i><br>
<i>&gt; (I guess I'll have to get me a portable InmarSat phone for mail-transfer)</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you happen to develop a nano-bot for defusing mines, let me know.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually Cambodia is not a bad idea, lots of work that needs to be done</i><br>
<i>&gt; over there. With all this lo(nger)livety taken into account I might be</i><br>
<i>&gt; running out of interesting mountains if I don't cut down. Maybe I'll spend</i><br>
<i>&gt; a year doing something else and save some for later ;-).</i><br>
<p>
Why should we need to communicate with each other?  The two tasks are utterly<br>
different!  To solve the crack ghettos I need to rewrite the government,<br>
redesign the economy, do a neurological on drug addiction, and maybe use<br>
force-evolved viruses to target cocaine supplies.<br>
<p>
If you want my recommendation on the genocide problem, here it is:<br>
<p>
If people knew what was going on, if they could see videos of children being<br>
cut in half by gunfire instead of reading about "ethnic strife", there would<br>
be enough popular support to send in enough troops to solve the problem.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, our taboo against genocide, and our taboos against violence,<br>
prevent newspapers from printing such pictures, and prevent TVs from showing<br>
such films.<br>
<p>
So collect all the documentation you can find into a Web site,<br>
www.genocides.org.  Advertise that Web site all over the Internet.  Put death<br>
totals for all the countries into the animated banner, and stills from the<br>
most horrifying photos you can find.  On the site, have some way for Americans<br>
to immediately send email to their Congressman, the President, maybe a list of<br>
international governmental addresses, a place for them to add their name to<br>
petitions, send email to the U.N., a readable list of the most inspiring<br>
letters mailed from the site...<br>
<p>
Considering the technological leverage of our times, one wealthy donor would<br>
probably be enough to finance the entire thing.<br>
<p>
Just because the newspapers refuse to print it, and the TVs won't show it, and<br>
the politicians won't talk about it, is no reason we shouldn't know about it.<br>
<p>
If the modern genocides are as bad as the Holocaust, show!  Don't tell!<br>
<p>
There seems to be a fad in inspiring quotes lately.  May I introduce one from<br>
the Principia Discordia?<br>
<p>
              A SERMON ON ETHICS AND LOVE <br>
<p>
One day Mal-2 asked the messenger spirit Saint Gulik to approach the Goddess<br>
and request Her presence for some desperate advice. Shortly afterwards the<br>
radio came on by itself, and an ethereal female Voice said<br>
<p>
              YES? <br>
              "O! Eris! Blessed Mother of Man! Queen of Chaos! Daughter of<br>
              Discord! Concubine of Confusion!<br>
              O! Exquisite Lady, I beseech You to lift a heavy burden from my<br>
              heart!" <br>
              WHAT BOTHERS YOU, MAL? YOU DON'T SOUND WELL. <br>
              "I am filled with fear and tormented with terrible visions of pain.<br>
              Everywhere people are hurting one another, the planet is rampant<br>
              with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own<br>
              people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.<br>
              O, woe." <br>
              WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THAT, IF IT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO? <br>
              "But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it." <br>
              OH. WELL THEN, STOP. <br>
