<i>&gt; I don't know for sure exactly what are the percentages of cells damaged</i><br>

<p>
I think I mentioned this before, but.. dehydrate the cells!  I wish<br>
someone versed in zoology would butt in here and add some more informed<br>
discussion about the frogs that freeze and unfreeze with no outside<br>
intervention.<br>
  If the frog's strategy of dehydrating their cells does not work for<br>
humans, give me a reason why not. <br>

I'm not saying I have faith in the Prometheus Project's projection, but I<br>
can observe the current rate of technological advancement, and from that<br>
extrapolate that medical technology will be doing things we can't even<br>
comprehend in the very near future.<br>
	As for unfreezing, how will they know when aging is controlled?<br>
Say someone has lived for 500 years, do we know he will live forever?<br>
Obviously not.  Will we ever know?  Well, maybe in an infinite number of<br>
years.  I have doubts that cryonics organizations will use this<br>
information to judge when to unfreeze me.  I expect to be unfrozen when<br>
they can repair whatever damage killed me.  I don't expect this to be a<br>
very long wait unless we suddenly fall into another dark ages.  Medical<br>
advances occur every day.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Speaking about how long it will take for us to control aging, never</i><br>
<i>&gt; forget that even when we correct all the errors in our genome that</i><br>
<i>&gt; create aging now, we will have to worry about the errors that will cause</i><br>
<i>&gt; us diseases when we are 200, 300 or 1000 years old! Our knowledge will</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to advance faster than the millions of genetic errors that millions</i><br>
<i>&gt; of years of evolution have not corrected, it's a very difficult task</i><br>
<i>&gt; (that's why I'm 19 and already worrying about aging). For more see "Why</i><br>
<i>&gt; are We Allowed to Age?" in <a href="http://mithlond.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/why.htm">http://mithlond.esoterica.pt/~jpnitya/why.htm</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; (remember I asked this a couple of months ago?)</i><br>
<p>
Do you intend to still have a genome in 1000 years.  I don't.  I'll have<br>
had all the kids I want to by then, so why else would I need one?  If you<br>
don't like the flawed human genome, get rid of it!  Think about the<br>
advancements that have occurred in the last 50 years... now think what we<br>
will be able to do 1000 years from now.  Getting rid of the genome will be<br>
trivial.  This is in essence what "uploading" is, I suggest you do some<br>
research.  There is already a multitude of nascent strategies for<br>
uploading the human mind. <br>
  All this would be irrelevant to you if you think the genome is necessary<br>
for consciousness- but, again, give me some evidence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As a conclusion, I think that for old persons going to cryonics their</i><br>
<i>&gt; chances of immortality are minimal. If one is cryopreservated at an</i><br>
<i>&gt; early age with few brain damage then he might survive.</i><br>
<p>
This seems awfully pessimistic... even if it isn't, what other options do<br>
you have?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; As for the identity issues, there are many interesting situations. Like</i><br>
<i>&gt; persons who endure terrible accidents or drug abuses. There is a case in</i><br>
<i>&gt; which a man had an iron through he's brain that completely changed his</i><br>
<i>&gt; personality although his intelligence was pretty much the same as</i><br>
<i>&gt; before. Is this the same person as before? I think not. Am I the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; person I was 10 years ago (neural changes have been huge)? No but I</i><br>
<i>&gt; changed, I blossomed into another person in a continuos process and that</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not the case in cryonics or accidents. </i><br>
<p>
Buddha would agree with you.  By saying that you are not same person as 10<br>
years ago, are you saying there is no self?  That's basically what Buddha<br>
said, but it all depends on how you define self.<br>
<p>
I would say there is a self, but it is not a state.  It is a history of<br>
states and changes of state, with the potential for even more<br>
history-making.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Anyway, I'm not planning to</i><br>
<i>&gt; have irons going through my brain neither going to cryonics, I'll just</i><br>
<i>&gt; concentrate my efforts on the aging research.</i><br>
<p>
Why are you placing all your bets on aging research?  This seems overly<br>
risky :(<br>
