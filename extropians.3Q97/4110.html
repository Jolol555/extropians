Although he is a 'fundamentalist' (in the take-it-literally sense), he is not<br>
a Christian fundamentalist in the TV sense of which the term has connotations.<br>
<p>
If you were to ask him how to reconcile the two, he might point out that God<br>
told Adam that he would die on the 'day' in which he ate from the Tree, and<br>
yet Adam lived considerably longer.  And, he might say, there exists a<br>
tradition relating the two uses, demonstrating that 'day' does not necessarily<br>
refer to a 24-hour period.  He would also be very careful to explain that you<br>
can't just point out things at random and say they're metaphors; the alternate<br>
usage of a _word_ has to exist _in_the_Bible_ and there has to be a<br>
pre-existing tradition that the two are related.<br>
<p>
I am making this particular explanation up, but we have discussed religious<br>
issues from time to time, and I am adapting one he used.  The real explanation<br>
might be quite different.  Ask your local priest, mullah or rabbi.<br>
