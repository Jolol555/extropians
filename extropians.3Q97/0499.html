Didn't Stephenson assume the assemblers only worked in a vacuum? It<br>
is very probable that the first assemblers will need very special<br>
environments to work well, and not unreasonable to think that the<br>
cost of designing robust assemblers is higher than providing them<br>
with their special environments (and as you point out, it provides a<br>
safety measure and gives the manufacturers more control). <br>
<p>
However, assemblers that can spread in the biosphere are possible<br>
(existence proof: bacteria), the question is only how high the design<br>
threshold is to make them. My guess is that there will be few<br>
incentives at first, but plenty of research on robust nanodevices<br>
(for e.g. medical use), and at some point it becomes possible to<br>
combine the technologies into robust assemblers theoretically able to<br>
spread in a goo fashion. The grey goo disaster is still unlikely (I<br>
worry more for the golden goo and red goo problem), but it is<br>
possible in principle.<br>
