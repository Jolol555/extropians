Hi!<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Why do you say that? Most people I met in the Internet say I have an<br>
excellent English. Even when I go abroad and have to speak English,<br>
no-one has ever said I had a bad knowledge of the English language,<br>
you're the first and I would like to know why.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Even more time-taking</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; questions, do you think I just say that people who ask me these</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; questions are ignorant and shouldn't even deserve to be by my side?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course they're ignorant!  They're ignorant of the A chord.  As for not</i><br>
<i>&gt; deserving to be by your side, who, exactly, said that???  I think I may</i><br>
<i>&gt; have missed that post.  </i><br>
<p>
No-on said that, I was asking a rhetorical question to serve as an<br>
example of the attitude some people presented when I asked my questions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; course not, I would like more and more persons to learn guitar and since</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I love it, I teach anyone who asks me to, within the limits of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; knowledge, even that I have to give the same answer 10, 20, 100, 500</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; times.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What if you are asked this question so many times, it begins to detract</i><br>
<i>&gt; from your aging research?  Then, would you be so altruistic?</i><br>
<p>
It is just not being altruistic. A better example is my aging research,<br>
the more people I can teach about aging, the more people will be<br>
interested and start researching and the more people would try to solve<br>
the aging problem. The more people try to solve the aging problem, the<br>
quicker will it be solve, the better for all of us, including myself.<br>
Answering your question, if someone woke me up to ask me how to play a B<br>
chord, I would be upset because that persons disturbed my sleep.<br>
Obviously I mention asking questions within the limits of reasonable,<br>
the extreme case you are proposing is almost impossible of happening.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Now, do you think that you spread the extropian movement by sitting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; around thinking: - I'm very smart, the others are ignorants and only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; when they, by their own means, know as much as I, will I then see them</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as my fellows.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; hmmm... I must have missed a lot of the posts.  When was all this said?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is it possible you're reading a little to much into people's suggestion :</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Go read a book."?</i><br>
<p>
Like I said before, it is an example of the kind of attitude some people<br>
expressed, this wasn't said by anyone.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Instead of being a small group of which no-one (at least in Portugal)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; has ever heard of, and taking 20, 50, 100 or 500 years to develop</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nanotech and life extension, if others would support "our" (this is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "our" between commas because I don't agree with all your principles)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cause this objectives would much soon be achieved.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True, but this should be achieved without coercion.  I take responsibility</i><br>
<i>&gt; for my own education- I don't expect others to be there to answer my</i><br>
<i>&gt; questions when the answers are at my local library.  Once I have this</i><br>
<i>&gt; information, I can make an informed debate, and decide for myself the</i><br>
<i>&gt; validity of this information.</i><br>
<p>
That is why most persons never heard of extropianism. Do you think that<br>
is a good thing?<br>
All I'm trying to say is that I disagree with this kind of attitudes and<br>
I think that trying to convert persons to "our" cause is a good thing<br>
that should be pursued. It takes work, of course, but it is, IMHO, the<br>
right decision. The rules of the list are clear, the list doesn't exist<br>
to make converts, I respect that although I disagree.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I told you "the A chord isn't actually an A, it's a B flat", you would</i><br>
<i>&gt; say I'm wrong.  What if I replied: "I don't believe you, but I don't want</i><br>
<i>&gt; to read any books on subject... maybe I will eventually get around to it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In the mean time, I don't believe you.  It's obvious that the A chord is</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually B flat, I don't understand how you can even begin to think it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; not."  Wouldn't that make you a little frustrated? (come on, be honest ;)</i><br>
<p>
Yes but if you ask 100 guitar player what is an A chord, they will ALL<br>
give you the same answer. However, if you ask 100 economists if<br>
free-markets are the best solutions, they won't give you the same<br>
answer. Free-markets is not (at least for many people) the best<br>
solution, it's not the ultimate truth. An A chord is always an A chord<br>
and if anyone disagrees on that he is immediately wrong, if someone<br>
disagrees with free-markets he is not necessarily wrong. <br>
