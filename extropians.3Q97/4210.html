Hello all, I joined the extropy list as a response to Freespeak's<br>
invitation to discuss/debate the NSPIC concept.<br>
<p>
For purposes of context, you should know a little about me.  I have<br>
always been libertarian in my thinking.  Such thought processes come<br>
naturally ... individualism, respect for rights of others, etc... <br>
Truthfully, I had always been an 'outsider' until I discovered the<br>
Libertarian Party where others felt/thought similiarly.  Indeed, some<br>
books I had read did indicate that I was not unique, but I didn't meet<br>
the authors ...<br>
<p>
I attended government run schools, but since I was more intelligent than<br>
most and learned far more quickly than the curriculum progressed, I was<br>
mostly bored.  I did a bit of daydreaming and for the most part endured<br>
the boringness of it all.  But, since I could answer the vast majority<br>
of questions correctly without paying attention, I never got sucked into<br>
the brainwashing that goes on there.<br>
<p>
I was out of high school for many years before I even realized, however,<br>
that there was brainwashing going on ... and I did fall partially victim<br>
to a bit of false understanding about the world.  It was the experience<br>
of the world after leaving school that revealed this.<br>
<p>
I think, despite being basically libertarian in my philosophy since<br>
shortly after birth, that there was still an enlightening process that<br>
occured to really awaken my understanding of the world around me and of<br>
the value of my basic approach to life, my basic philosophical outlook.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; political systems are kept in</i><br>
<i>&gt; place at the deepest and most fundamental level</i><br>
<i>&gt; by a number of illusions </i><br>
<p>
So, I guess that what I am doing is relating my life in an<br>
oversimplified manor to basically second the above quote.  The illusions<br>
begin with the 'political socialization' process in early childhood,<br>
progress through the government run brainwashing centers, called public<br>
schools, and often proceed right on through the interactions and<br>
activities in the workplace.  It seems that few people question them,<br>
once cultivated.  And fewer still will shed them.  Personally, I never<br>
succumbed to the majority of them.  But, even so, some illusions still<br>
penetrated my thinking.  They were easy to resolve once I had found<br>
others with a similar philosophical base to discuss issues and events.<br>
<p>
I never really developed a bad case of NSPIC, which is what I have<br>
called the BGAS (Big Government Addictive Syndrome), but in shaking off<br>
the little case I had, I have noticed that several things are required:<br>
1)  Some fundamental knowledge of rights and markets (which requires<br>
some specific classes of metaphysics and epistemology), and <br>
2)  Self confidence.  Particularly with respect to one's own ability to<br>
reason.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and the unwitting use</i><br>
<i>&gt; of words that hide and perpetuate these illusions.</i><br>
<p>
Language is crucial ... I think I have taken too much time already<br>
though ... I'll step back and let others discuss now ...<br>
