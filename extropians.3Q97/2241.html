<i> &gt; It's time we stopped granting rights and started taking them away.</i><br>
<i> &gt; Such as the right to discriminate, something society and government </i><br>
<i> &gt; passed out many years ago.</i><br>
<p>
To discriminate is to distinguish, and the right to<br>
discriminate arises in the ability to discriminate, which does<br>
not originate with the government.<br>
<p>
The right to discriminate is the right to choose your associates.<br>
Free association is the ability to control (in the long term) your<br>
own future development... it is part and parcel of the task of<br>
self-creation.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that you are preaching universal love. Now, the<br>
older I get, the fonder I become of the old ideal of universal<br>
love.  But we are born lions, one and all, and it's always<br>
struck me as pointless and obtuse to quack about universal love<br>
to fourteen-year-old boys who will *mostly* have no idea what the<br>
heck you're talking about no matter how long you quack. I know<br>
that I certainly wouldn't have. Perhaps in the era of uploads,<br>
we'll be able to start hacking up our legacy code, and it will<br>
be interesting to see what the old ideal of universal love<br>
grows into in *that* environment. (Note: I'm not accusing you<br>
of quacking, just pointing out that universal love is one of<br>
those things that is much quacked about.)<br>
<p>
But you can't enforce universal love through legislation, which<br>
is what anti-discrimination legislation attempts to do. Forcing<br>
people to do what you are telling them is good for them arouses<br>
tremendous amounts of resentment, and rightly so. Morality and<br>
legislation should be firewalled apart, IMHO.<br>
<p>
Personally, what I feel toward those people who have for decades<br>
shaped their own personal development by filtering out all information<br>
that was not offered by people of their own race, class, and<br>
gender... is pity.  And I'm really not very fond of feeling pitying.<br>
(Read too much Nietzsche, heh heh.) Wisdom is funny stuff, and I<br>
suspect that it, too, is still tinted and tinged with the colors<br>
of race, class, and gender. Personally I have tremendously benefited<br>
from paying attention to and trying to absorb some women's wisdom,<br>
black people's wisdom, stuff that is invaluable to me and very<br>
difficult to find when I go browsing among white men's wisdom. But<br>
I was initially programmed as a white man, and so I think it's<br>
perfectly okay for me to have a taste for white men's wisdom. But<br>
I think I'm much stronger and much happier now for having sought<br>
out the wisdom of the women and the black people that I have been<br>
lucky enough to meet.<br>
<p>
(Class is much harder for me to think about because I completely<br>
bought into the standard American brainwashing about the unreality<br>
of class until just a few years ago. As a result, I have only a<br>
hazy idea of what class I belong to... which is probably the sort<br>
of thing that motivated the people who initiated and propagated<br>
the standard American ideology about class.)<br>
