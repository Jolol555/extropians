Being dedicated to the future progress of humankind <br>
should be the prime concern of all civilized beings. <br>

----------<br>
This is a common meme, but I'm not sure it's correct.<br>
I think that the major driving force for flattening<br>
the organization is the advent of the PC. Each manager<br>
has become a great deal more productive, so we need less<br>
managers. I know, all the studies say otherwise, but the<br>
economic forces that drove the growth of management hierarchies<br>
were the increases in productivity of the organizations that<br>
employed them: those organizations became more proifitable than<br>
their competitors and won in the marketplace, because the tasks<br>
the managers were doing increased the productivity of the<br>
companies. Now many of those tasks can be done more efficiently<br>
because the computers help. Therefore, companies need fewer<br>
managers to provide the same level of management.<br>

Dear fellow Extropians,<br>
To some extent the point made is valid.<br>
It must be remembered, however, that the PC is neither the beginning nor<br>
the end.<br>
There is a bigger and broader picture (or paradigm).<br>
Changes in human behavior in response to education and inovation have, I<br>
think, far more to do with changes in organizational structure.<br>
Humankind does, after all, progress.<br>
<p>
Enjoy,<br>
