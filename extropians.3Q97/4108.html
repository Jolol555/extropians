Wrong.  You said:<br>
<p>
"Our case is much different, first because we are obviously much more<br>
complex than any microorganism or even than a frog."<br>
<p>
to which I said:<br>
<p>
"That's not a reason, silly!"<br>
<p>
and you replied:<br>
<p>
"Errors occur and since we are more complex the chances of errors<br>
occurring increases"<br>
<p>
Come on, Joao, selective amnesia really detracts from a debate.<br>
<p>
I'm wrong ever day, can you admit maybe your were in error, just with<br>
once?  It would really make it easier to debate with you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There might be exceptions but statistically speaking, mammals are bound</i><br>

<i>&gt; more complex.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What does IMHO mean, I've always wondered.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In My Humble Opinion.</i><br>
<p>
thanx :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not in the same way as us. Our species appeared about 100 000 years ago</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; while other species (such as alligators, etc) appeared much before. Of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; course that evolution made them more complex but at a lower rate than us</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; and made them more 'perfect'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'd like to hear your definition of "complex" and "perfect" as it pertains</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to this statement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I define "perfection" as the absence of mistakes/errors. More 'perfect'</i><br>
<i>&gt; means with less errors. "Complexity" is harder to define, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; biology/zoology, perhaps the more functions an organism performs the</i><br>
<i>&gt; more complex he is (including internal, cellular functions). Or perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; the higher different types of proteins or cells an organism has, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; more complex he is.</i><br>
<p>
What if the organism has a multitude of different proteins and cells, but<br>
they are organized in a simplistic way?  I am wholly unsatisified with<br>
this definition, and I fail to see how you can make such a concrete<br>
biological statement based on it.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, sharks do get cancer, they get it a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; much lower rate than us but they naturally get it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Really?  Live and learn.  When was this discovered?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think I read it in Steven Austad's "Why We Age" (1997), I don't know</i><br>
<i>&gt; who discovered it but I remember reading that he talked to a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; specialists and they toll him of a few cancers that sharks get. I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; have the book, I read it in a library but I'll try to find the answer to</i><br>
<i>&gt; your question.</i><br>
<p>
thank you, Joao.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If you think the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; functioning and abilities of your brain are "spiritual" and unknowable,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; then I cannot debate with you, because your ideas have been cemented by faith.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think so, I was asking if you think so, I'm sorry if I offended</i><br>
<i>&gt; you.</i><br>
<p>
I was not in the least bit offended, but I am a little offended that you<br>
chose to erase and not answer my original question : "Where do you find<br>
something "spiritual" from my phrase "functioning and abilities of the<br>
brain."  Functioning and ability indicate something concrete and<br>
studyable.  If I said "mystical powers of the brain," this would indicate<br>
something "spiritual"  Is this just a language problem?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ...this is the great thing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; about not having faith... infinite possibilities ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, if I wanted answers to all questions I would have gone to theology</i><br>
<i>&gt; and not Microbiology (just kidding).</i><br>
<p>
Whew, good! ;)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think you'll find the majority of people want to fight aging. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; majority of people also want to die, when it is "their time."  Weird,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; isn't it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; They don't want to die, they just learn to accept it.</i><br>
<p>
I going to have to beg to differ on this one.  Most religions promise a<br>
superior afterlife, filled with bliss and devoid of all human problems and<br>
pain.  If I was a member of one of these religions, I would not only<br>
accept death, I would be giddy with anticipation.  I would want to die,<br>
and if they didn't make that little rule that you go to hell if you commit<br>
suicide, I would do it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps they're</i><br>
<i>&gt; the smart ones, have a quiet, peaceful life while we burn our neurons</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to solve aging. We'll probably get ulcers too.</i><br>
<p>
Our stomachs may get ulcers, but theirs will be rotting underground.  I<br>
prefer ulcers. (especially now that they can cure them with antibiotics)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think you have entirely missed my point.  I will give you 3 points will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; together will give you much grief:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 1. Your brain is fragile- you will lose neurons whether you age or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 2. You have a finite number of neurons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 3. Your neurons do not grow back.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 4. You (I assume) want to live for a long time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll just write a citation from Leonard's Hayflick "How and Why We Age"</i><br>
<i>&gt; "A controversial question in biogerontology is whether or not we lose</i><br>
<i>&gt; nerve cells as we age." This is from the 1994 edition, there is a 1996</i><br>
<i>&gt; edition with an extra chapter, I've read that chapter but I haven't read</i><br>
<i>&gt; the rest, presumably it's the same sentence in the 1996 edition.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And yet you affirm that I lose neurons!</i><br>
<p>
Yep.  And I'll affirm it again: you lose neurons.  Maybe not every day,<br>
I'm not making any claims about that.  Remember when you reminded me of<br>
that man who had the pole through his head, and his personality change.<br>
Do you think he lost some neurons?  Do you think it was aging?<br>
Have you ever played soccer?  Did you know that soccer players who head<br>
the ball more have lower IQ's?  Do you think the soccer ball is just<br>
accelerating the aging process?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Personally I think that we lose neurons but this is just to show you</i><br>
<i>&gt; that sometimes things are not as simple as they look. IMHO, we lose</i><br>
<i>&gt; neurons basically because of aging.</i><br>
<p>
I won't argue with that.  Sounds reasonable, but it doesn't affect my<br>
point in the slightest.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You put an interesting question, if one doesn't age, will he lose</i><br>
<i>&gt; neurons (naturally, of course)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sincerely I don't know and I bet (unless something new has been</i><br>
<i>&gt; discovered in the last months) you don't either.</i><br>
<p>
Looks like I've discovered something new!<br>
<p>
I can see the headlines now:<br>
<p>
"'Pole Through Head May Harm Neurons,' Says Geoff Smith, Prominent<br>
Neuroscientist"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I guess we'll just have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to wait and see.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; While looking in Hayflick's book I found a mention to replicating</i><br>
<i>&gt; neurons in songbirds but he isn't very precise, all he says is that,</i><br>
<i>&gt; songbirds' neurons replicate.</i><br>
<p>
Try that Discover article I told you about, I think it has numerous<br>
references.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Give a laboratory so that I can try them out.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Ah, but I am just a student.  Go where the money is-- not here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Where is the money? </i><br>
<p>
Not here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What are you planning to do when you graduate?</i><br>
<p>
Find it.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess it's a bit irrational (when you don't have any evidences and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; need to draw conclusions, you use your balls right?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; No, I don't.  I find my balls are not very good at making logical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; deductions.  What do women do?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Probably nothing, it explains a lot of things (sorry, stupid joke, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; apologize immediately).</i><br>
<p>
I will accept your apology on behalf of 3 billion women.  Although I'm not<br>
sure why you would apologize, I think this tesicular deduction you speak<br>
of may explain why there are more women in university than men. (maybe not<br>
in Portugal, but in Canada there is)<br>
<p>
Luckily, I am not adding to this imbalance since I do not make testicular <br>
deductions.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You're going to let computers become more intelligent than you?  Haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you seen Terminator 2 ?!?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes I did but as long as they serve us, it's ok.</i><br>
<p>
Why do you think that an entity *more* intelligent than you in every way<br>
would want to serve you.<br>
<p>
Myself, being not neccessarily more intelligent than you, does not want to<br>
serve you, so why would a more intelligent creature wish to?  <br>
