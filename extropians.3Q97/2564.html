You're right that nanites could reduce unliving matter to lower chemical<br>
energies for energy.  But there are several caveats:<br>
<p>
Rock is mostly out.  Some of it might be tappable, but the density would<br>
be very low; you'd have to chew huge volumes to do anything.<br>
<p>
Biomass is energy-rich.  But it's a limited source.  If you turn a large<br>
fraction of biomass into nanites I suspect the remaining fraction won't<br>
power their activities for very long.  Also remember that only 20% of<br>
living or recently dead biomass is useful as feedstock or fuel, because<br>
the rest is water, one of the most useless substances for mech-nano.  So<br>
if defenders can constrain the progress of a pool of goo it could run<br>
out of fuel soon unless it went solar, and solar can be cut off.<br>
<p>
} religious fanatic that wants to destroy the world. The basic issue <br>
} has been whether a private (non-global) immune system can deal with <br>
} this threat.<br>
<p>
Scenario: New York City is the last city left.  All other continents are<br>
a seething mass of grey goo, released by the first "nano-power", which<br>
is also the religious fanatic above.  This goo is fuel- or<br>
solar-powered; does not have internal communications, and thus doesn't<br>
do dynamite or nuclear bombs; and is made of aluminosilicates, so it<br>
won't burn.  How NYC survived to this stage I'll ignore, but I'll assume<br>
it has acquired some stockpiles as necessary.  Also that NYC has more<br>
researchers than any single lab.<br>
<p>
First line of defense: shaded concrete moats.  Convertible into nanites,<br>
but very energy poor.  Nanites crawling over the surface (probably not<br>
in a straight line, I'd guess random walk strategies are used) get<br>
washed off by water hoses.  NYC has plenty of water available.  This is<br>
probably a temporary solution, especially if the nanites anchor<br>
themselves to the surface at each step (that should slow them down?) or<br>
can tunnel underground (sink concrete curtains, then they won't have<br>
energy to go through.)  But that's okay.<br>
<p>
Since the beginning of the crisis researchers have been working on<br>
captured nanites.  Obviously they're looking for countermeasures --<br>
chemicals which will gum up the nanites, or dissolve them, or<br>
something.  But they're also busy figuring out how the things work; by<br>
releasing the nanites the "nano-power" has thrown away its only<br>
advantage.  Perhaps the NYC researchers will be able to come up with a<br>
predator nanite for the goo, which they then release around the<br>
perimeter.  Counter-goo!  Or should I say Bronx-goo?  Defeated nanites<br>
and recaptured land become new resources for the counterattack, solving<br>
the problem of limited resources.  Soon New York has conquered the<br>
world.<br>
<p>
No global immune system; no private nano-immune system to begin with.<br>
Just physical barriers which hold until superior intellectual resources<br>
outfight the attack.<br>
<p>
} mobiliy to the nanites themselves, would be that somebody sprays them <br>
} over a forest from a small aeroplane during the night. Most people <br>
 <br>
Scenario: these are presumably carbon-based nanites, if they eat wood.<br>
The forest is quickly consumed into a huge lake of goo, but the area of<br>
the lake can only spread so far -- only the perimeter nanites are<br>
useful.  In the meantime it's been noticed, and someone ignites the<br>
mess, causing possibly the world's larges fuel-air explosion.  This<br>
scatters lots of nanites all over the place, leading to the "nano-Pern"<br>
scenario: people rush out to find growing puddles of nanites and<br>
flamethrower them.  Concrete houses become a big fad.  Again, nanites<br>
are quickly captured and analyzed, this time by a research establishment<br>
dwarfing that of the previous scenario.  Life is unpleasant, and the<br>
ecosystem is having lots of holes eaten in it, at least at first, but<br>
total destruction is not imminent.<br>

<p>
The "designs" I've heard of have been of single types of materials, or<br>
limited families of materials.  They supposedly can manipulate anything,<br>
but it's all made of diamondoid.  The flammability of which no one seems<br>
to have addressed.<br>

willing to have evolving nanites.<br>
