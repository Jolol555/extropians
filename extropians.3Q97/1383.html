The crux, cleanly expressed.<br>
<p>
But then how may/must this be instantiated?  I have a particular distaste<br>
for patchouli oil.  When I took up with a certain young person some years<br>
ago, she wore the filthy stuff.  I mentioned diffidently how much I<br>
detested its stench (Yetch! Barf!).  With a light-hearted cry, she flung<br>
the bottle into the bin and it was never seen or smelled again.  I thought<br>
this a charming and generous act.  But suppose a new work colleague bathed<br>
in patchoulli, and refused to abandon it.  I suppose I could add the scent<br>
of vomit to the air, or just an increasingly bad tempered mien, but that<br>
wouldn't necessarily help.  And suppose the colleague agreed to forego the<br>
pong if I chose not to wear my running shoes to work.  But damn it, they're<br>
the only comfortable shoes I've ever owned, and they *don't* smell.  And<br>
suppose the typical bigotted clients get so uptight at my colleague's<br>
homosexual repertoire, however muted, that they take their business<br>
elsewhere and we're closed down?  But suppose it's not gay behaviour they<br>
resent but black skin or Jewish noses?  It gets tricky.  Optionality<br>
perhaps has something to do with it - you can decide to forego patchouli<br>
without a major identity crisis, but not the folds of your eyes.  But what<br>
if your hackers all *jest lerve* to go without bathing and washing their<br>
hair and cleaning their teeth?  Yep, it's tricky.  Personally I resolve<br>
many of these hazards by working at home, but that's a cheap way out.<br>
