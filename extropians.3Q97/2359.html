In another venue I've noticed that there's to be a Statist's convention<br>
(Kyoto Japan I think) in which our masters are going to decide to impose a<br>
"Carbon" tax upon us to prevent that massive and all prevailing<br>
horror...global warming.  All because they think that the earth currently has<br>
20 or so per cent more CO two in it's amosphere than it did in the past...and<br>
we all know...don't we.. that CO2 causes the horrible "green house" effect...<br>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;pssst....pay no attention to that man behind the<br>
currtain...water-vapor&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
They're even rigging (this is new?) the numbers to make sure it<br>
happens...i.e. leaving out any indication that there is other than unanimity<br>
regarding a consensus.<br>
<p>
Now the way I understand it...as was experessed earlier I beleive by another<br>
list member.....<br>
<p>
For all of the past discoverable history....or at least the last half<br>
milllion years or so...the earth has experienced ice ages which last for a<br>
hundred or so thousand years...with about ten thousand years of warmer<br>
weather between....<br>
<p>
All of civilization and most of pre-history (as far as homo-sap is<br>
concerned)...i.e. the last ten thousand years...has been in a warm<br>
period...in other words ....were due .<br>
<p>
I also recall that around the dawn of the industrial revolution it started to<br>
get cooler...a lot cooler...such that it was called a "Mini" Ice age in some<br>
quarters...also Greenland,when discovered,  wasn't called green because of<br>
the color of it's snow...<br>
 <br>
Now suppose...just  suppose ,Ma Nature was getting ready to cool of<br>
fTerra-not-so -Firma about 200 yrs ago or there -abouts...but that irrascible<br>
ingrate...homo-sap just happened to start causing lots of addittional CO2<br>
(and other gases) to infiltrate the heretofore pristine atmosphere<br>
 (Volcanoes...fumoroles...geysers...they're all NATURAL...so they don't<br>
count)...and as a consequence...delayed the onset of the scheduled Ice Age.<br>
<p>
Wouldn't it be a kick?  Our loveable lords and masters...bless their greedy<br>
little hearts...so intent on filching some more cash so they can feed their<br>
various "Pork"...cause a global catastrophe...exactly the opposite of what<br>
they are professing.<br>
<p>
(note...this is not new...politicians NORMALLY  do exactly the opposite of<br>
what they say...just hasn't had global consequences until now)<br>
<p>
Anders...better called up Mr. Gomes...maybe he's got a room to rent.<br>
