Excellent point, and it give me yet another reason to try to prevent<br>
computers from surpassing my intelligence: I don't want to be a pet.  If I<br>
end up being one, I think I will have to take some funky drugs to be<br>
content staying that way.<br>
<p>
Side point:  Do you think if humans were to become the pets of a superior<br>
power, they would evolve to become less intelligent, like domesticated<br>
cats and dogs?  This might solve the "funky drug" problem for my children.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; In _Excession_ a ship-Mind talked about the interest it took in the</i><br>

<i>&gt; "State of the Art" the ship is alleged to like to hook humans up</i><br>

<p>
Sounds plausible to me. ;)<br>
  <br>
Another Side Point: I find I'm envious of extropian list-members'<br>
knowledge of science fiction.  I've read minimal amounts, so most of the<br>
ideas taken for granted by some of the more well-read people are entirely<br>
new to me.  Then again, this deficit forces me to be creative since I have<br>
no sci-fi to quote.<br>
