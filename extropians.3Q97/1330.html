Yes, but why are there no papers in (say) Nature, Science or even<br>
Scientific American if it works? While the big scientific journals<br>
are admittedly conservative (they have to be), even they would<br>
publish a paper that clearly demonstrated cold fusion in a correct<br>
scientific manner, especially if there were prototypes already<br>
working commercially (most likely preceeded by in Nature by a "news<br>
and views" review by one of the harshest critics now claiming he was<br>
for cold fusion all the time). <br>
<p>
Clarke doesn't exactly count as a scientific authority (too bad), so<br>
we cannot apply his first law to him ("When an old an respected<br>
scientist says something is possible, he is probably right. When he<br>
says something is impossible he is bery probably wrong"), and morning<br>
TV is notorious of showing anything that would interest people. The<br>
russian hot water heaters sounds interesting, but have all the<br>
hallmarks of pure rumor (remote location, good story, no details<br>
making it easy to check) and seems unlikely given that if cold fusion<br>
could be commercialized that easily, it would be very easy to<br>
demonstrate globally. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Don't know myself...but from where I stand it appears as plausible as the</i><br>

<p>
There is a difference: quantum mechanics is a tried and tested theory<br>
(you see proof of it just by using the semiconductors in your<br>
computer), whose *interpretations* are a field of weird speculation,<br>
philosophy and matter of opinion (at present). Cold fusion claims a<br>
certain physical process occurs, but has not yet produced widely<br>
available evidence. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They didn't cover that in Truck Driving School...or I missed that day...or I</i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't have beleived them anyway since it was run by the gubment and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; mistrust EVERYTHING they say.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, you probably missed the lesson in quantum philosophy, solid<br>
state physics and applied epistemology, but it isn't mandatory :-)<br>
<p>
I think it is a bit stupid to mistrust *everything* the government<br>
says - one has to apply sceptical thinking here too. A sceptic<br>
doesn't believe in what he hears, and he doesn't doubt it either. He<br>
tries to find out if it is true or not.<br>
