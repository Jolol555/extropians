Possibly 'company' was a bad word for use in what I am trying to describe.<br>
 The anarchic system would mean all people are individuals, they do not work<br>
for a company or government.  Each individual offers goods and services on<br>
the market; whether these individuals form into groups or operate under a<br>
company name is irrelevant.  Companies can be described as a group of<br>
individuals each working towards the same goal, they don't have to know each<br>
other, they don't even have to have contracts between them.  They can even be<br>
in competition, but still working towards progress in the same area.<br>
 Management decision is limited, because the market decides who does what.<br>
 For instance, if I produce X amount of a product, but cannot seal that<br>
amount I will reduce X and put my resources into other area's.  There is no<br>
consensus between groups of individuals as they work alone (unless they<br>
decide on consensus).  Therefore each person only manages him or herself,<br>
surely this is faster than hierarchical management?<br>
<p>
Obviously taking figures out of chaos is hard, but I would think production<br>
and company management would improve dramatically - If we have the<br>
communications infrastructure to handle such a system.<br>
<p>
I don't see this as the most democratic system, or the fairest system.  I see<br>
this as the system that will build a competitive and productive environment<br>
that will increase progress.<br>
