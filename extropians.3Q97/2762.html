&lt;&lt; &gt; When a computer became the world Chess champion a few months ago the<br>
<i> &gt; apologists for biological brains were saying there were plenty of other</i><br>
games<br>
<i> &gt; where humans still had a commanding lead, the two most common examples</i><br>
given<br>
<i> &gt; were Go and Othello. Last week a computer beat Takeshi Murakami, the world</i><br>
<i> &gt; Othello champion, 6 games in a row. Any bets on how long Go will hold out?</i><br>
 <br>
 At least a decade. Perhaps 15 years.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
