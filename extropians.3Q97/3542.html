But in their culture this was considered 'acceptible behaviour'. This was<br>
my original point (several posts ago ;-) What is justifiable and what is<br>
not is dependend on culture, time, situation. No absolute right or wrong<br>
exists.<br>

<i> &gt;&gt; With a Darwinian Economy I meant an economy without any ethical rules or</i><br>

<p>
Please explain to me how commercial governement/legal system works?<br>
The governement may not be all that nice and efficient but giving control<br>
over the ICBM'ss to an organisation who's primary purpose it is to make a<br>
yearly profit seems rather risky to me.<br>
<p>
But I am genuinly interested in your explanation.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt; I'm not saying it won't work, I</i><br>

But I<br>

<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;So by your own definition you're a fascist (you put the interests of the</i><br>

<p>
I could think of some situations (in theorie at least) were I would put the<br>
interest of a number of persosns (the group) above the interst of one<br>
induhvidual. I'm pretty sure I am not a facist, based on the discussion of<br>
the last few days I expect many Extropians would classify me as a<br>
social-democrat or a socialist. Well... maybe I'm guilty of being somewhat<br>
of a 'leftie' by US-standards. But hey, my grandparents were communists so<br>
I guess I'm moving in your direction ;-)<br>
