One more comment on the copying question.<br>
<p>
Suppose we change it so that instead of making one copy if the coin<br>
falls heads, we make 100 copies.  You go through the experiment and<br>
awaken, and on the other side of a piece of paper is written which<br>
way the coin fell.  Subjectively, are you almost certain that it says<br>
"heads"?<br>
<p>
Suppose you bet on a thousand-to-one overnight longshot, but arrange to<br>
have a million copies made if you win the bet during the night.  Do you<br>
wake up in the morning convinced that you won the bet? (Not that it will<br>
do you much good, dispersing your winnings among a million copies...)<br>
<p>
Would it be good advice, once copying becomes practical, to make lots<br>
of copies when good things happen, and none (or perhaps even killing<br>
off your own personal instance) on bad things?  Will this change the<br>
subjective probability of good events?<br>
<p>
Tentatively it would seem that the answer to all these questions is yes,<br>
although for the last one we have to specify that we mean "retroactive"<br>
probabilities, perceptions once the events have ocurred.<br>
