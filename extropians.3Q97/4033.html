Hi!<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; If you admit you were generalizing, do you retract your statement that</i><br>

<i>&gt; your post)</i><br>
<p>
I didn't claimed human cells more difficult to cryosuspend, I claimed<br>
human beings more difficult to cryosuspend than frogs, there is an<br>
important difference and I still maintain my opinion on that matter.<br>
There might be exceptions but statistically speaking, mammals are bound<br>
to be more difficult to cryosuspend than other species because they are<br>
more complex.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What does IMHO mean, I've always wondered.</i><br>
<p>
In My Humble Opinion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Not in the same way as us. Our species appeared about 100 000 years ago</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; while other species (such as alligators, etc) appeared much before. Of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; course that evolution made them more complex but at a lower rate than us</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and made them more 'perfect'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd like to hear your definition of "complex" and "perfect" as it pertains</i><br>
<i>&gt; to this statement.</i><br>
<p>
I define "perfection" as the absence of mistakes/errors. More 'perfect'<br>
means with less errors. "Complexity" is harder to define, in<br>
biology/zoology, perhaps the more functions an organism performs the<br>
more complex he is (including internal, cellular functions). Or perhaps<br>
the higher different types of proteins or cells an organism has, the<br>
more complex he is.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; BTW, sharks do get cancer, they get it a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; much lower rate than us but they naturally get it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Really?  Live and learn.  When was this discovered?</i><br>
<p>
I think I read it in Steven Austad's "Why We Age" (1997), I don't know<br>
who discovered it but I remember reading that he talked to a few<br>
specialists and they toll him of a few cancers that sharks get. I don't<br>
have the book, I read it in a library but I'll try to find the answer to<br>
your question.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you think the</i><br>
<i>&gt; functioning and abilities of your brain are "spiritual" and unknowable,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then I cannot debate with you, because your ideas have been cemented by faith.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think so, I was asking if you think so, I'm sorry if I offended<br>
you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ...this is the great thing</i><br>
<i>&gt; about not having faith... infinite possibilities ;)</i><br>
<p>
Yes, if I wanted answers to all questions I would have gone to theology<br>
and not Microbiology (just kidding).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think you'll find the majority of people want to fight aging. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; majority of people also want to die, when it is "their time."  Weird,</i><br>
<i>&gt; isn't it?</i><br>
<p>
They don't want to die, they just learn to accept it. Perhaps they're<br>
the smart ones, have a quiet, peaceful life while we burn our neurons<br>
trying to solve aging. We'll probably get ulcers too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think you have entirely missed my point.  I will give you 3 points will</i><br>
<i>&gt; together will give you much grief:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. Your brain is fragile- you will lose neurons whether you age or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2. You have a finite number of neurons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3. Your neurons do not grow back.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 4. You (I assume) want to live for a long time.</i><br>
<p>
I'll just write a citation from Leonard's Hayflick "How and Why We Age"<br>
"A controversial question in biogerontology is whether or not we lose<br>
nerve cells as we age." This is from the 1994 edition, there is a 1996<br>
edition with an extra chapter, I've read that chapter but I haven't read<br>
the rest, presumably it's the same sentence in the 1996 edition.<br>
<p>
And yet you affirm that I lose neurons!<br>
Personally I think that we lose neurons but this is just to show you<br>
that sometimes things are not as simple as they look. IMHO, we lose<br>
neurons basically because of aging.<br>
You put an interesting question, if one doesn't age, will he lose<br>
neurons (naturally, of course)?<br>
Sincerely I don't know and I bet (unless something new has been<br>
discovered in the last months) you don't either. I guess we'll just have<br>
to wait and see.<br>
<p>
While looking in Hayflick's book I found a mention to replicating<br>
neurons in songbirds but he isn't very precise, all he says is that,<br>
songbirds' neurons replicate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Give a laboratory so that I can try them out.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ah, but I am just a student.  Go where the money is-- not here.</i><br>
<p>
Where is the money? What are you planning to do when you graduate?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I guess it's a bit irrational (when you don't have any evidences and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; need to draw conclusions, you use your balls right?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, I don't.  I find my balls are very good at making logical</i><br>
<i>&gt; deductions.  What do women do?</i><br>
<p>
Probably nothing, it explains a lot of things (sorry, stupid joke, I<br>
apologize immediately).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You're going to let computers become more intelligent than you?  Haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt; you seen Terminator 2 ?!?</i><br>
<p>
Yes I did but as long as they serve us, it's ok.<br>
<p>
See ya,<br>
