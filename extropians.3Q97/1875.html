<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is nothing magical about the number 2, it's just the simplest example. </i><br>
<i>&gt; In your case the universe splits into 5, in 4 of them event A happens in one </i><br>
<i>&gt; of them event B happens. You split just like everything else and have an 80% </i><br>
<i>&gt; chance of seeing event A.</i><br>
<p>
This is indeed a possible route: we make sense of the <br>
probabilities by postulating multiple identical worlds. The drawbacks <br>
of this is, first, that we need to buy a whole lot of new ontology. <br>
This is bad but perhaps not as bad as it first seems, since what is <br>
multiplied is not laws and explanatory principles but only the <br>
objects (worlds) postulated by the theory. Nonetheless, if we have to <br>
introduce an uncountable infinity of parallell worlds, that is a bit <br>
hard to swallow.<br>
<p>
 John Clarke suggests that quantum mechanical <br>
predictions can be exactly reproduces even without a countable <br>
infinity, provided that we accept some indeterminism:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For example, most of the time the world dives into exactly 2, on</i><br>
<i>&gt;rare  occasions with irrational probability it divides into exactly </i><br>
<i>&gt;3. The probability  of seeing the event is an irrational number a </i><br>
<i>&gt;little greater than 2 but less than 3. I never said Everett was </i><br>
<i>&gt;deterministic and got rid of probability, irrational or otherwise, I </i><br>
<i>&gt;only said it solved the measurement problem.</i><br>
<p>
As far as I can see, this would leave us with  a countable infinity <br>
of worlds, but would cost us determinism, a rather attractive feature <br>
of the Everett interpretation. Is this bargain worthwhile?<br>
<p>
An alternative way would perhaps be to say that the Schroedinger <br>
equation is only right to an extremely high degree of accuracy: all <br>
real probabilities are rational numbers; the amplitude square is only <br>
very, very close to the real probability. Is this too inelegant to be <br>
plausible?<br>
<p>
Perhaps we could go further and make do with a large unbounded <br>
*finite* number of parallel worlds?<br>

<i>&gt;IMO you can't take this "universe splitting" idea that literally.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;What I prefer is to suggest that the effect of the decoherence (and </i><br>
<i>&gt;resulting independence) of branches of the state function is "as </i><br>
<i>&gt;though" the universe were splitting.  But there is only one state </i><br>
<i>&gt;function; what changes is which part of it you can interact with.</i><br>
<p>
But what is the difference between a universe in which branches of <br>
the state function split off and a univerese wherein it is "as <br>
though" there were branches that were splitting off? Are there any <br>
observations that could distinguish between these hypotheses?<br>
<p>
We introduced the many worlds in order to fix the probabilities. <br>
If we scrap the worlds then we seem to be back on square one again, <br>
with "measure" that doesn't correspond to the probabilities that stem <br>
from the ontology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A good, accessible article comparing the popular many-worlds</i><br>
<i>&gt;interpretation with Everett's original relative-state formulation is</i><br>
<i>&gt;Am. J. Phys 58 (9), September 1990, p. 829.  (Am. J. Phys. is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;relatively non-technical journal for physics teachers and students.) </i><br>
<i>&gt;Among the arguments against MW in the popular form is that it </i><br>
<i>&gt;violates conservation of mass, since new universes are being created </i><br>
<i>&gt;all the time.  This is really a matter of misunderstanding Everett's </i><br>
<i>&gt;key idea.</i><br>
<p>
It is often said that deWitt is responsible for misrepresenting <br>
Everett in his popularizations. Is this the misunderstanding you are <br>
referring to? For my part, I don't think that the nonconservation of <br>
energy is a very serious objection to the Everett interpretation, <br>
even if taken to imply that literally new world are created all the <br>
time.<br>
