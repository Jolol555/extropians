<i>&gt; I apoligize sincerely, it was a very mean thing for me to point out.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; general, your grammar is very good-- probably better than mine; however,</i><br>
<i>&gt; my little remark was in reference to your statement "I don't know nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt; of economics."  When you say "don't know nothing," that is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; double-negative.  It's almost as big a mistake as when I finish half my</i><br>
<i>&gt; sentences with a preposition.  Ah, we're Science students, we don't know</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing about grammar, do we?</i><br>
<p>
Actually neither is a mistake at all--in English, a double negative<br>
just means something different from what was intended, but is valid<br>
grammatically.  Putting a preposition at the end of a sentence is<br>
also a perfectly valid practice in English, and any teacher who tells<br>
you otherwise should be summarily fired for incompetence.<br>
<p>
But let's not start a grammar war here (though I'd be happy to<br>
start one in private email :)<br>
