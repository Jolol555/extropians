<p>
I have a weird hunch that it is *not* possible to make solid<br>
predictions about chaotic systems without prohibitive amounts of<br>
computation power in the general case. It may be possible to prove<br>
this assertion (or may not -- "does P=NP" has held for a very long<br>
time without a proof.) The related question of "is it possible to make<br>
solid predictions in interesting specialized cases" may be more<br>
tractable.<br>
<p>
I don't make any predictions about what the great discoveries of the<br>
next century will be, given that if we really truly hit exponentially<br>
self-feeding intelligence enhancement its unlikely that we'll have<br>
even a tiny shot at predicting what the next hundred revolutions of<br>
the earth around the sun will hold -- probably more changes for<br>
ourselves than we have experienced thus far in our whole existance as<br>
a species, and perhaps more change for life than it has undergone in<br>
its entire existance on the planet.<br>
<p>
However, I can easily name something on my "most wanted" list of<br>
information. <br>
<p>
What do I want to see? A theory framework that answers (in a<br>
meaningful way) the question "why does the electron weigh as much as<br>
it does" or, in the same vein, "why is the speed of light in a vacuum<br>
what it is?"<br>
<p>
Similarly, the framework should answer (in a meaningful way) the<br>
question "why is the formula relating velocity, mass, and energy of a<br>
body in motion what it is?"<br>
<p>
For years now, we have built up this large coherent body of equations<br>
and constants that give us answers to physics questions. What I want<br>
to know is -- why *these* equations? Why *these* constants?<br>
<p>
The answer may turn out to be unknowable, or there may be an<br>
underlying answer to what gives rise to particular bits of the physics<br>
bestiary. I suspect that some of the questions (like why the charges on<br>
the electron and proton are what they are) may have better answers<br>
than others. At this point, even coming up with coherent ways to<br>
phrase some of the questions is hard...<br>
