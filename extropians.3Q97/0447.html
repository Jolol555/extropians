Many, if not most people wear the clothes they wear because they feel<br>
that they look good in them. Why would I put on an article of clothing<br>
that I thought detracted from my appearance? In much the same way, to be<br>
"clothed" in a belief system connotes a type of external showmanship<br>
that may indeed be a way to cozy up to a certain group of people, or<br>
even win a vote or two. <br>
<p>
Furthermore, beliefs cycle their way in and out of style much like the<br>
latest fashions. Mainline Marxism has in many ways become out-of-style,<br>
and instead, supplanted with the new, more flexible "Marx-based"<br>
frameworks. The intelligentsia turn their noses up at "last season's<br>
holdovers." Of course, to be cutting-edge you have to clothe yourself in<br>
the lastest ideological style.<br>

Good post, RH.<br>
