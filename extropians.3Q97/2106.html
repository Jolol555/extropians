Wow - this is beautiful writing.  The last section is tremendously moving<br>
and awe-inspiring.  I should warn people that I have some brief excerpts<br>
from the web pages here.  If you want the full impact you should first<br>
read the few pages starting from the URL above, which constitute the<br>
conclusion to the book.<br>
<p>
In "Let There be Light", Rawlins first describes the accretion of<br>
dust grains, gradually, slowly, falling together, becoming more dense,<br>
finally bursting into nuclear flame as the heart of a star.  I really<br>
didn't know where he was going with this.  I was stunned when he turned<br>
it into a metaphor for our own future:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We seem headed for our own starbirth, drawn to it just as</i><br>
<i>&gt; inexorably as those grains merge, accelerating toward it</i><br>
<i>&gt; just as surely as the merging accelerates. The attraction is</i><br>
<i>&gt; massive, relentless, unstoppable. When our starbirth</i><br>
<i>&gt; comes, some of us will no longer be truly human; and things</i><br>
<i>&gt; we now call machines will no longer truly be machines.</i><br>
<p>
One thing that seems wrong to me is the title: "moths to the flame"<br>
sounds too much like one of the anti-computer screeds by the likes of<br>
Cliff Stoll.  Actually, Rawlins' book seems to cover many good and bad<br>
aspects of the changes which computers will bring.<br>
<p>
He is cautionary in the concluding chapter when he describes what<br>
he means by this image:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What's special today is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; because of the computer, an undifferentiated intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt; amplifier, our technology has nearly reached critical mass</i><br>
<i>&gt; and is now juggernauting us around the dance floor at such</i><br>
<i>&gt; a pace that we may never again be able to stop and catch</i><br>
<i>&gt; our breath. Now prisoners of the dance, we're moths</i><br>
<i>&gt; irresistibly attracted to the flame of technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Prometheus, disguised as a scientist, has given us that</i><br>
<i>&gt; flame. But fire also burns.</i><br>
<p>
The changes ahead will be hard for some people.  But Rawlins emphasizes<br>
that change is necessary, that stasis would be far worse.  His conclusion<br>
is so good that I can't resist quoting it:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A strange new world is coming, and coming fast, partly</i><br>
<i>&gt; brought into being by a strange new machine. For various</i><br>
<i>&gt; short-term and inescapable reasons of our own we're</i><br>
<i>&gt; rapidly creating an empire of the mind, and now we must</i><br>
<i>&gt; find some way to dwell in it. Our future is filled with</i><br>
<i>&gt; enormous danger, yes, but it's also filled with unimaginably</i><br>
<i>&gt; exciting possibility. Everywhere, life seems to be gathering</i><br>
<i>&gt; itself for a great leap forward. After millions of years of</i><br>
<i>&gt; slow germination, we're rapidly beginning to flower.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We, all of us, are part of the most thrilling adventure ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; unleashed on planet earth. Instead of looking backward in</i><br>
<i>&gt; anger and fear, let's look forward to the next dance step in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the adventure we're crafting for ourselves. A century or so</i><br>
<i>&gt; from now, the earth may simply be the home world of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; species rich and strange, a fiercely new and amazingly</i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting species---transhumanity. The human</i><br>
<i>&gt; adventure is just beginning.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Let's dance.</i><br>
