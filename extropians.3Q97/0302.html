<i>&gt; I didn't make an argument about whether we have, or will be, visited. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; simply tried to say that if anybody was able to visit us thru space, they</i><br>

There are physical limits to stealth capability. Any "Stealth" vehicle<br>
can still be seen by radar from a certain range of angles. A stealthed<br>
vehicle is designed so that the large majority of angles at which radar<br>
is likely to hit it at are such that they are reflected in a direction<br>
different from that which it came from. This is passive stealth, which<br>
if maximized, is usually hard to detect. Incidentally, the flying saucer<br>
is the most stealthy shape useful in a flying vehicle.<br>
<p>
Active stealth, which can more effectively hide a vehicle from detection<br>
equipment designed for a specific range of emanations,  will require the<br>
use of electrical, magnetic, or gravitational fields, all of which are<br>
capable of being detected by additional specialized gear.<br>
<p>
Remember, even in Star Trek, they were able to eventually develop a<br>
countermeasure detection capability to the Klingon cloaking device.<br>
<p>
The most effective possibility is materials which absorb as much<br>
incoming radiation as possible. Some such materials are used today to a<br>
limited extent for radar absorption, but are only effective in absorbing<br>
diffused radar. The main beam reflection must still be redirected. It<br>
cannot all be absorbed. Even if fully absorptive materials are<br>
developed, it will then be possible to detect vehicles by the absence of<br>
background radiation, that which is being absorbed by the vehicle.<br>
<p>
The Roswell incident was supposedly due to some sort of on board<br>
explosion, a malfunction. Given that machines always do break down no<br>
matter who builds them, it is not unreasonable that a vehicle would<br>
break down after an interstellar flight and entering our atmosphere. Man<br>
made air vehicles have always had maintenance requirements of between<br>
20-100 man hours per flight hour. THe more cutting edge ones always had<br>
higher maintenance requirements, with the exception of some of our new<br>
military planes like the F-22, but vehicles like the space shuttle and<br>
the stealth bomber are still way up above the top of the range.<br>
<p>
I once used this to debunk some abduction nuts. They were claiming that<br>
1 out of every 40 people have had abduction experiences. Doing a<br>
utilization analysis of this figure relative to the populations of the<br>
US and the world, I was able to come up with  figures showing that we<br>
should be experiencing between 1-12 UFO crashes per YEAR in order to<br>
support the size fleet required to abduct one in 40 people. Given this,<br>
we should statistically have seen at least several such crashes in<br>
highly populated areas that would have been witnessed by thousands of<br>
people.<br>
<p>
As for your assertion of any visitors not being detected, this goes<br>
against logic. Given that some group, corporation, or government on<br>
another planet would have shelled out billions if not trillions of<br>
EBE-bucks for such an expedition, the idea that they would not try to<br>
wring out the maximum PR, scientific, or economic value from that<br>
investment is ludicrous.<br>
