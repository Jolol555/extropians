<i>&gt;a self-reflexive "evaluation of the character of the evaluation"</i><br>
<i>&gt;from the highly specific perspective of human neural behaviors.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Just this afternoon I completed 'Report #TL07A: The Anatomy of<br>
Slavespeak.'  It should be accessible at<br>
<p>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm</a>&gt;<br>
<p>
some time, 9/23/97.  "Slavespeak" is my word for the language<br>
that keeps the NSPIC illusions in place.  'Anatomy of Slavespeak'<br>
is a 148K report, about a quarter of which deals with General<br>
Semantics and how GS relates to Slavespeak.<br>
<p>
I've been talking and writing about NSPIC issues since 1977.<br>
It was only in 1993 that I became effective enough to influence<br>
a few people to clear the NSPIC spooks (that sounds nice!) from<br>
their heads.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From experience, I expect that very few people will find 'Anatomy</i><br>
of Slavespeak' readable.  You, trained and experienced in GS, will<br>
probably find it a relatively easy read.<br>
<p>
Most people, if confronted with the totality of NSPIC all at once,<br>
would run a mile.  So I'm looking for a series of steps to "ease<br>
people into" NSPIC, a small piece at a time.  I started with the<br>
"royalty" illusion, because, tough as it may be for some to overcome,<br>
I thought it would be the easiest.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Leaving aside the appropriateness of such an evaluation in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;context of this list for the moment, I don't see that</i><br>
<i>&gt;self-reflexiveness explicitly illustrated in any of the posts to</i><br>
<i>&gt;this point.  I find myself wondering if "neuro-semantic"</i><br>
<i>&gt;represents a construct for later introduction, or if the NSPIC</i><br>
<i>&gt;topic, as planned for presentation, has little connection with</i><br>
<i>&gt;neuro-semantics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
'Anatomy of Slavespeak' does cover some neuro-semantic aspects<br>
related to abstracting Slavespeak words and how they may influence<br>
perception, thought, communication, and behavior.  To introduce<br>
any of this into the debate at this time would be "jumping the gun."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Addressing the appropriateness of the topic on various</i><br>
<i>&gt;shared-interest lists, I can comment that, to the degree that</i><br>
<i>&gt;"NSPIC" *does* involve neuro-semantic considerations, it may have</i><br>
<i>&gt;an appropriate 'home' on a list dedicated to general semantics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;(I would forward the name of an appropriate list-manager upon</i><br>
<i>&gt;request in order that the appropriateness of such a discussion</i><br>
<i>&gt;might receive at least a preliminary evaluation of "appropriate</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the list.")</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
If most of the members of a GS list were highly freedom-oriented<br>
and interested in the possibility of clearing out from their heads<br>
any NSPIC spooks that may dwell there, then it would be appropriate,<br>
otherwise not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Moving to such a list, though, might represent a bit of a problem</i><br>
<i>&gt;for stirring up political passions.  G.s. doesn't seem to lead to</i><br>
<i>&gt;passion, but rather to careful analysis of both evidence and human</i><br>
<i>&gt;analytic methodologies.  The passivity of agreement with</i><br>
<i>&gt;philosophical perspectives tends not to find a fertile ground in</i><br>
<i>&gt;such a context.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
The process that people need to go though to clear NSPIC spooks<br>
from their heads tends to be psychological, analytical, and<br>
experiential.  Many people seem to have almost insurmountable<br>
psychological barriers to confronting the possibility that some<br>
of their "certain knowledge" might constitute NSPIC spooks.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I would find it useful to have some framework, some evaluative</i><br>
<i>&gt;model, presented in the context of NSPIC.  Think of the framework</i><br>
<i>&gt;as a specific experimental procedure, or, if more appropriate, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;a specific theory from which we might draw predictions and thus a</i><br>
<i>&gt;path towards falsification.  Such a framework would, itself, stand</i><br>
<i>&gt;as susceptible to criticism, both for its evaluative</i><br>
<i>&gt;appropriateness and for its appropriateness in the context of this</i><br>
<i>&gt;list.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
If such a framework were to be created, it could come from the<br>
published NSPIC-related materials:<br>

know someone who might be?<br>
