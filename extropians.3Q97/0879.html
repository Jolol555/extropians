My understanding is that anti-matter, despite being highly energetic, makes<br>
poor bomb material.  The results would resemble something more like an<br>
extremely energetic fizzle than an explosion and is far too difficult to<br>
handle in quantity.  Not at all economical in comparison to more<br>
conventional nuclear materials.  Research in anti-matter as a military toy<br>
has been directed more towards (anti-)particle beams and the like.<br>
