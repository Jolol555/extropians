<i>&gt; &gt; To build an optimised nano </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We're talking about gray goo here, right?  That has to live in the wild,</i><br>
<p>
No, black goo (deliberately designed war goo, destruction goo, doom <br>
goo) (grey goo is accidental). What I had in mind was something that would be able to live in <br>
the wild, but even without that ability you could still have immense <br>
millitary advantage from being able to build unlimited amounts of <br>
military equiptment in large tanks practically for free.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; without getting all its little cogs and conveyor belts clogged up with</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural molecules  that just happen to fit into its various nooks and</i><br>
<i>&gt; crannies.</i><br>
<p>
An easy way to fix this would be to have those inner parts isolated <br>
from the environment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;For example, a universal Turing </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;machine has been constructed in Conway's Life world. The entity is </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;very big and it was hard, but nothing near a thousands of genius-year </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;task, to do it. The feasibility stems from the fact that you have </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;identical components that you can put together into bigger identical </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;components, and so on, and at each step you need only consider the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;apparatus at a certain level of abstraction. If this is the right </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;analogy for nanotech, then the design work would seem tractable, once </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the right tools are there. But I will take your opinion on this </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;issue into account in my future thinking. And debugging is also a </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;complication.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree that Conway's Life self-replicator design could be carried out to</i><br>
<i>&gt; completion in a short time.  However, it is not a good analogy.  The Life</i><br>
<i>&gt; world is perfect, so engineering reduces to mathematics. </i><br>
<p>
On the atomic level, our world is perfect too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Moreover, Conway</i><br>
<i>&gt; designed his machine to function in an infinite vacuum, so the complexity</i><br>
<i>&gt; produced by the impingement of the world is not present.</i><br>
<p>
Seal it off then.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I doubt that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Life self-replicator could exist in a sea of random pixels, inasmuch as any</i><br>
<i>&gt; design for Life machinery I have seen will be completely destroyed by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; single erroneus pixel.</i><br>
<p>
What about having three (or more) of these original self-replicators, <br>
and one unit that compares the output and kills the one whose output <br>
diverges from the other two, and prompts the construction of a <br>
replacement. Of course, if noise levels get too high then everything <br>
will fall to pieces.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; (3) Drexler and Merkle are two very (very!) smart guys.  They have labored</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; for years, and designed what?  Some bearings, a transmission, a PLA, and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Stewart platform?  And you claim this shows how easy it is?  I'd hate to see</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; an engineering task you considered hard! </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Those are again optimized designs. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No they aren't.  Thay are pretty much the first designs they came up with</i><br>
<i>&gt; that didn't explode in simulation.</i><br>
<p>
I stand corrected.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;What about the rod logic </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;computer? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The only part of it designed to atomic precision was the PLA (programmable</i><br>
<i>&gt; logic array) I mentioned above.  Even there, only the rods were designed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; atomic precision, not the frame that holds them, so maybe I shouldn't count it.</i><br>
<p>
What is the reason why the design only went that far? Was the rest <br>
conceptually too difficult or was it just too big for the computer <br>
simulation to verify?<br>
