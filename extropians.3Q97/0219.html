Some of my objections to Brent's contention that we will be able to prove <br>
things about consciousness just like we do about Geometry, may strike you as <br>
ridiculously unlikely.  I agree, but it's no more bizarre than rejecting the <br>
link between intelligence and consciousness, lots of things are logically <br>
possible but not worth considering.<br>
<p>
I see no reason why someday we will not have an excellent theory of <br>
intelligence.  Actually I thing we'll have a pretty good theory of <br>
consciousness too, but not unless we make a number of assumptions and not<br>
one we can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt to be better than any other such <br>
theory, just beyond a reasonable doubt. <br>
             <br>

<i>        &gt;We will so thoroughly understand the laws of physical consciousness </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and how they correspond and predict what WE feel as we observe, </i><br>
<i>        &gt;manipulate and stimulate our own brain </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
Because your own consciousness is the only one you can observe you must use <br>
yourself as a test subject, by performing experiments on yourself you hope <br>
to develop a theory to " thoroughly understand the laws of physical <br>
consciousness". Understanding means being able to make predictions, so that <br>
could not work. Turing proved that a finite state machine can not always <br>
predict what it will do next, for example if it will stop. If we are <br>
finite state machines then we can't understand ourselves completely and if <br>
we are not then we have a soul and Science can not help us in this matter.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;that there will be no other possibility </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
Even with something much less exotic and far more tangible than consciousness, <br>
like heat or pressure, we can't PROVE that other theories currently unknown<br>
can not explain the facts as well as standard Thermodynamics or maybe even <br>
better. If we can't prove we have the one true theory for something that <br>
simple how could we do it for something astronomically more complex? You'll <br>
never be able to prove a rock is not conscious, it might not achieve it the <br>
same way you do but by some other method you know nothing about.<br>
                      <br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;but that others with similar neural correlates are experiencing </i><br>
<i>        &gt;similar sensations.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Similar? If something is similar then it is not identical. If the failure of <br>
my upload to reproduce apparently trivial qualities like the color of my <br>
brain, changes consciousness so much that it is no longer me, then how can you <br>
ignore the much more profound differences between one person and another?  <br>
If you're correct then tiny changes in a brain can lead to profound <br>
differences in consciousness, even if the behavior changes not at all.  <br>
It would also seem that some very big differences in brain mechanism can <br>
sometimes have no effect on consciousness, for example, if my brain ran <br>
backward for an hour and then forward, my consciousness would be unaffected <br>
even though my brain was operating very differently.<br>
                      <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt;</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;The person I was debating with maintained that the people might not</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;be conscious while in the computer, that the downloading process</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;actually would end up inserting false memories of earlier conscious</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;experiences.  While logically possible, I think the discrepancy</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt; between this point of view and the sense people had of their</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt; experiences would make it effectively unsupportable.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Brent:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;Why?  If this was true then I could argue that the artificial</i><br>
<i>        &gt;fictional memories implanted in Arnold's mind during Total Recall</i><br>
<i>        &gt;prove that the fictional experience was real simply because it</i><br>
<i>        &gt;"struck" Arnold that they were real.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
All memories are real, whether they correspond to the physical objects they<br>
claim to is another question entirely, but as consciousness is not a physical <br>
object this is not relevant.<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;we will know that memories reverse uploaded from an "abstract" </i><br>
<i>        &gt;simulation of ourselves are not real memories of real feelings we </i><br>
<i>        &gt;actually had but that they are merely from abstract, unfeeling, </i><br>
<i>        &gt;simulations.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You're saying that this theory is so good that I would be able to know what <br>
it's like to be you BETTER than you do. If I said "I'm sorry Brent but after<br>
studying your brain and using my theory I must conclude you're not conscious" <br>
then you would have to say "you know best, I thought I was conscious but <br>
I was wrong". I would have more claim to be Brent Alsip than you do, I know<br>
him better.<br>
<p>
Suppose a doctor told you that you were born with a rare brain disorder but<br>
fortunately there is a cure. You take a pill and notice no difference. The<br>
doctor says that you have never in your entire life been conscious until<br>
you took that pill 10 seconds ago, your memories of being sentient before<br>
that were "false" memories. Would you consider such a doctor to be a quack?<br>
