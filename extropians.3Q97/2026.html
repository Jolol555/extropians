I agree with Luke and Anton that I'd have liked more time to talk.<br>
Of course I knew that would be my position the moment I saw the<br>
schedule.  Most big name people I know hardly spend any time at<br>
conferences listening to talks.  They're mostly talking with people in<br>
the halls etc.  <br>
<p>
Let me add to the chorus of people who really enjoyed Extro 3.  What I<br>
mainly enjoyed was meeting all you people in person.  You people are<br>
much more like me, and like people I'm very comfortable with, than<br>
most people I see most of the time.  I was also reminded how important<br>
it was to meet in person sometimes.  I never really had one of those<br>
in depth work-it-all-out conversations I imagine would be the payoff<br>
of personal meetings.  But I did get a much better image of people's<br>
styles and personalities, which helps me interpret and react to their<br>
email postings.  I think it is very valuable for virtual communities<br>
to meet in person periodically. <br>
