Interview of Forrest Bishop by Bill Spence<br>
December 10, 1996<br>
The "Optical Assembler," fka the "Food Replicator"<br>
<p>
<p>
[[Note: This is a partial description of an idea I originally had several years ago. <br>
It has not<br>
proceeded past the conceptual stage, and is offered only for your entertainment.<br>
Forrest Bishop ]]<br>
<p>
<p>
Bill (B):	Forrest Bishop on a different kind of replicator, one that does not <br>
involve robot arms.  <br>
<p>
Forrest (F):	Right.<br>
<p>
B:	What does it use to manipulate?<br>
<p>
F:	This is very similar to what was on the original Star Trek episodes.  They <br>
called it the "Food <br>
Replicator".  It was depicted as a box in which things would simply appear when you <br>
wanted them, and so I <br>
use that name because it has some of the same properties.<br>
<p>
B:	Is the food replicator...Earl Grey tea or ...general country doctor?<br>
<p>
F:	Yes, this is very speculative technology; it's not a for-sure thing; it's more <br>
out on the fringe.  The <br>
central idea is ...<br>
<p>
B:	Well, first, let me ask you, what is a replicator?  It manipulates atoms in <br>
foods and puts them in <br>
specific places where you want them to be? <br>
<p>
F:	Yes, to build an object, you want to create an object that's atomically <br>
precise.  So, some kind of <br>
device to do this.<br>
<p>
B:	And one kind of system is basically robot arms that physically <br>
move things.<br>
<p>
F:	Yes, that's the most popular version.<br>
<p>
B:	And this is completely different?<br>
<p>
F:	Yes, it uses electromagnetic energy in a structured <br>
electromagnetic field to do the same thing.<br>
<p>
B:	To move individual atom, more than one atom:?<br>
<p>
F:	Individual atoms, molecules, small structures.<br>
<p>
B:	Small structures?<br>
<p>
F:	Yes, possibly.<br>
<p>
B:	What does this device look like?  How does it function?  How does <br>
it work?<br>
<p>
F:	The central idea is to create a structured electromagnetic field <br>
that is variable in real time.  The <br>
atoms are moved around by the electromagnetic field.<br>
<p>
B:	Atoms can be moved around by electromagnetic field?<br>
<p>
F:	Yes.<br>
<p>
B:	What frequency are we talking about?<br>
<p>
F:	Roughly, light, visible spectrum, about [600 nanometers] <br>
depending on the particular atom, <br>
depending on whether you're trying to ionize it or not.<br>
<p>
B:	So you're pushing atoms with light?<br>
<p>
F:	Yes.  This is already being done now.  It's partially based on <br>
..<br>
<p>
B:	Trapping an atom with lasers, right?<br>
<p>
F:	Yes.  This has already been accomplished.  In this environment, <br>
imagine a flat plate of emitters <br>
that are--each emitter is addressable; each emitter is very tiny.  By <br>
changing the timing--you have a row of <br>
them--by changing the timing on them, you can create a wave front <br>
that's steerable, just as in a phased array <br>
radar.<br>
<p>
B:	OK.  Light frequency.<br>
<p>
F:	Yes.  So, a planar array of these --<br>
<p>
B:	A whole plane.<br>
<p>
F:	A whole plane consisting of a grid of emitters can construct a <br>
beam of the frequency of your <br>
choice.  The frequency can be varied over [time, space, and phase] <br>
also, and that way, you're creating a <br>
beam that is coherent or different frequencies in different parts of <br>
it, that's steerable over the half-sphere.  <br>
Ideally, you want to use emitters as small as possible--quantum well <br>
lasers are one possibility.<br>
<p>
B:	Are they attainable?<br>
<p>
F:	They are.<br>
<p>
B:	In frequency?<br>
<p>
F:	There's already existing devices that are wholly suitable.  These <br>
are also called artificial atoms for <br>
the reason that you have -- in them, you have an electron that is <br>
trapped in some kind of a potential well, <br>
which then [radiates] as the voltage varies the size of that potential <br>
well.  <br>
<p>
B:	Oh, it's [an] orbiting electron.  Instant frequency of what it's <br>
going to throw off in radiation?<br>
<p>
F:	That's right.<br>
<p>
B:	Pretty clever.<br>
<p>
F:	Yes.  These are existing devices.  Currently, researchers are <br>
trying to make arrays of these which is <br>
going to be difficult, from the one emitter ________one its neighbor.<br>
<p>
B:	Why?<br>
<p>
F:	Because these are tiny [quantum] mechanical properties that <br>
you're playing with.<br>
<p>
B:	So the radiation field of one would affect the other?<br>
<p>
F:	Yes, you could put it that way.  The electric field of the <br>
voltage that's being used to adjust the <br>
potential well in one is affecting its neighbor as well.<br>
<p>
B:	How would you overcome that?<br>
<p>
F:	In this idea, the way to overcome it, if you will, is simply <br>
through computation  [of] the wave <br>
function [of the entire planar array].<br>
<p>
B:	Would it take  into consideration how one field affects the <br>
other?  And changing whatever <br>
parameters necessary?<br>
<p>
F:	That's right.  It would take a massive amount of computer power.<br>
<p>
B:	OK, so you have a plate.<br>
<p>
F:	Yes, behind this plate, you have -- the equivalent of millions of <br>
supercomputers are needed to run <br>
this.<br>
<p>
B:	Oh, that much power?<br>
<p>
F:	That's right.  You're running in real time, and in this case, <br>
real time means you're obtaining a type <br>
of _________ range, so it's a huge computational problem that require <br>
nanocomputers in order to realize it.<br>
<p>
B:	I see.  So you've got one plate with a hemisphere that's <br>
completely controllable where the wave is, <br>
and even what frequency it is.  Then what?<br>
<p>
F:	Then what?  Now, imagine two of these plates facing each other.  <br>
A quantum well emitter is also a <br>
receiver.  A wave that comes in will cause a electron or  quantum well <br>
emitter to transition to a level, if it is  <br>
the correct frequency, which it will be, because it is part of the same <br>
system to design that in.  Therefore, <br>
you can create a standing between two plates.  You can steer that wave; <br>
you can, by phase shifting between <br>
the two plates, you can cause the nodes, the standing of the nodes...<br>
<p>
B:	Where there's energy and where there's no energy.<br>
<p>
F:	Yes, it vibrates something down, kind of like a violin string, <br>
and there are certain points on it that <br>
where the field strengths don't change, called the nodes, and at those <br>
points is where you place an atom and <br>
have it stay.  It's kind of similar to, if you take a board and want to <br>
saw on it, sawdust will bounce up and <br>
down on the boards and collect in the nodes, which is the places on <br>
that board that aren't moving up and <br>
down.  Some parts of the board move and some stand still, and that's <br>
where the sawdust collects.  It's a <br>
little bit like that.<br>
<p>
B:	So you could have atoms that would stay in the low-energy spots.  <br>
<p>
<p>
F:	Yes, which is the nodes.<br>
<p>
B:	But you could move those nodes, is that correct?<br>
<p>
F:	Right, by phase shifting between the two plates, you could move <br>
the nodes back and forth, and the <br>
atoms, theoretically, will move with the nodes.<br>
<p>
B:	Aha!  So, you can move atoms in one axis.<br>
<p>
F:	Yes, one axis.<br>
<p>
B:	So far.<br>
<p>
F:	So far.  Now, make it six plates.  Now you can construct a <br>
three-dimensional, fully specified, <br>
electromagnetic standing-wave field.  You can move it, and the atoms <br>
that are in it can be moved, shifted, <br>
in space.<br>
<p>
B:	Relative to each other?<br>
<p>
F:	Relative to each other, and relative to the box.<br>
<p>
B:	A lot closer together, if need be, or want?<br>
<p>
F:	You'd want it to be.  <br>
<p>
B:	Yes, I guess you would want it to be.<br>
<p>
F:	Yes, the idea is to inject an atom and have a wave front set up <br>
at that point that catches that atom, <br>
or small molecule, or what have you, perhaps you want to hit it with <br>
high energy to ionize it, to create a <br>
radical group, and then you use the standing waves to move it, in three <br>
dimensions, over to where you want <br>
it, and theoretically, cause a reaction.<br>
<p>
B:	Oh, in other words, bring it closer to another atom or molecule <br>
and cause a reaction.<br>
<p>
F:	Yes, [close to the structure] you're building.  Cause a reaction.<br>
<p>
B:	And because you have so much resolution, you could inject lots of <br>
atoms at one time in lots of <br>
places.<br>
<p>
F:	Because you have lots of computational power, you should be able <br>
to do that.  Every time you <br>
place an atom in this electromagnetic field, its field interacts with <br>
that field and, in principle, you can <br>
deduce the location of that atom by...<br>
<p>
B:	By its shadow?<br>
<p>
F:	By its effect on the overall field.<br>
<p>
B:	OK, so you constantly know where the position of all the atoms are, in real <br>
time?<br>
<p>
F:	Yes, like I say, this is getting kind of far out there.  Another problem is <br>
the wavelength is, say, 500 <br>
nanometers, which is much greater than the positional accuracy required for <br>
reactions.  However, by time-<br>
averaging the position of that atom, you should be able to deduce its position to a <br>
small fraction of a <br>
wavelength, in other words, to the resolution required for positional chemistry.<br>
<p>
B:	All right.  So, what we've got here is a box that you can inject atoms into <br>
and grab them with <br>
standing, very complex lightwaves, and literally move them around independently and <br>
get them into <br>
position to go into place.  As opposed to robot arms, you're using lightwaves, <br>
energy.  It sounds very <br>
exciting.<br>
<p>
F:	And the higher frequency lightwave can be used [to knock] an electron off an <br>
atom to create a <br>
radical group, and at the desired time.<br>
<p>
B:	Oh, so, it's more reactive; can jump into...<br>
<p>
F:	Remember, I was saying the plane consists of tuneable quantum well lasers that <br>
have a spatial <br>
frequency distribution so that you can address that atom with the UV ray you want.<br>
<p>
B:	Sounds pretty utilitarian to me.  It's very useful.<br>
<p>
F:	Yes, it's a lot of speculation.  It may or may not happen.  There's some <br>
research and ideas that are <br>
similar to this already being done, so...<br>
<p>
B:	Briefly, what is that research?<br>
<p>
F:	Well, I just learned of a fellow--I think he's simply conceived it--with what <br>
he calls an "optical <br>
crystal"--I think that's what he calls it--and it is kind of the same idea, of <br>
having a three-dimensional <br>
standing wave and placing atoms in the nodes, but not shifting it, but placing atoms <br>
in the nodes such that <br>
they form a lattice structure that's like a crystal, except the atoms are actually <br>
separated quite a distance, at <br>
least one wavelength of light apart, but they're in a lattice.  Now, as I've said <br>
before, the presence of those <br>
atoms alters the field, alters the electromagnetic field in spots, and therefore, <br>
gives it a new optical property <br>
that it didn't have before those atoms were there.<br>
<p>
B:	And it's detectable.<br>
<p>
F:	Yes.  For instance, the index of refraction would be different than if it was <br>
a box of [just] <br>
electromagnetic [energy].  And so by, for instance, changing the frequency, you're <br>
changing the lattice <br>
spacing, you're altering .. the [optical] properties of this volume ....<br>
<p>
B:	With this Optical Assembler...<br>
<p>
F:	That's a good name for it.<br>
<p>
B:	What do you feel like you could build?  Anything?  A cup of Earl Grey?<br>
<p>
F:	No, it's so speculative that I'm already out on a limb, and I don't know how <br>
much further I want to <br>
go.  Conceivably, anything; practically, there's a lot of unanswered questions.  <br>
Somewhere between there.<br>
