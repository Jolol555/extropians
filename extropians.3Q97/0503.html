<p>
	I'm not certain that "hardcoded into our brains by the genes" is<br>
quite correct.  Certainly there are some types of knowledge that can be<br>
had only by the intention of evolution (I use that loosely, I'm not<br>
promoting a deterministic view), such as walking.  We have the knowledge,<br>
we could say, a priori, and just have to learn to utilize it.  There are<br>
some bodies of knowledge, however, that arise in us naturally and not<br>
through sense data simply by the "structure" of the brain.  Now given, the<br>
brain is determined by biology, but the information that it percieves can<br>
in some instances arise by the _very nature_ and structure of the brain,<br>
not by the genetic information composing it.  Mathematics is one of these<br>
bodies of knowledge, I don't believe that it was written in our genes to<br>
discover mathematics, but rather it arose naturally as a benefit of the<br>
way in which our minds percieve.  Seeing in three dimensions is another<br>
example, if somewhat more "physical".  It isn't "hardcoded", but rather is<br>
by the very structure of our eyes and brain to percieve this way (imagine <br>
percieving naturally in other dimensions...). <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; But I</i><br>
<i>&gt; prefer not to believe in knowledge that has no causal origin, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; that's the only causal origin I can appeal to to account for what</i><br>
<i>&gt; philosophers have traditionally referred to as "a priori" knowledge.</i><br>
<p>
	This is a very materialistic view, or perhaps I should say<br>
biologically dependent view.  A good deal of knowledge is not dependent<br>
upon the biological entity percieving it.  What Locke would call Secondary<br>
Qualities, or Descartes Confused or Materially False ideas ARE dependent<br>
upon the observer, this is sense data.  But biological entities can have a<br>
priori knowledge of eternal truths, eternal throughout our universe, not<br>
by genetic intent (again, I'm not implying a telos) but by the very<br>
structure of their percieving.  In other words, we can have knowledge of<br>
eternal truths by virtue of having the structure that we have, the genes<br>
evolutionary purpose isn't necessarily to enable an understanding of these<br>
truths.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Regarding the direct intuitive perception of truth, as with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; perception of the truth of a mathematical theorem after spending</i><br>
<i>&gt; many hours playing with the axioms and lemmas that underlie its</i><br>
<i>&gt; proof, this is still rather mysterious stuff in neuroscientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; terms.</i><br>
<p>
	Douglas Hofstadter in "Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies"<br>
promotes a view of innate pattern recognition.  He does however discuss<br>
actually developing these abilities as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And I can't quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; get away from the fact that phrases used by the mathematicians to</i><br>
<i>&gt; describe the certainty of mathematical knowledge seems to map nicely</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the vocabulary used by Buddhists and other mystics to describe</i><br>
<i>&gt; the certainties arising in their holistic religious experiences.</i><br>
<p>
	*big grin*<br>
<p>
"One would normally define a "religion" as a system of ideas that contain<br>
statements that cannot be logically or observationally demonstrated...Godels <br>
theorem not only demonstrates that mathematics is a religion, but shows<br>
that mathematics is the only religion that proves itself to be one!" <br>
                                                   -J D Barrow<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; ...but the perception of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; gene-pool is not the perception of an individual organism, who is</i><br>
<i>&gt; born with the potential for the development and unfolding of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; "a priori" knowledge but to the pure empiricist is still tabula</i><br>
<i>&gt; rasa as far as a posteriori knowledge is concerned. And clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; the two interact:  a priori "knowledge" serves as a structure within</i><br>
<i>&gt; which a posteriori knowledge can be constructed, but might be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; mere scaffolding that is not much use without being empirically</i><br>
<i>&gt; informed, and actively developed by that other mysterious process</i><br>
<i>&gt; we call "thinking things through".</i><br>
<p>
	This relationship is of course the cure to Locke's claim that the<br>
mind is tabula rasa.  Indeed, there _must_ be some innate or a priori<br>
knowledge, to enable initial perception.<br>
