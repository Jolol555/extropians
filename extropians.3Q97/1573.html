Sarah,<br>
<p>
I think that you have a really good question. I know that there are lots of <br>
very good books written on the rise of western civilization. Almost all of <br>
them include lots of scholarly speculation on how the Calvinist (that is <br>
the Christian sect that you are referencing) made it O.K. to become filthy <br>
rich by reasoning that the more rich a person became the more god must <br>
truly be blessing them. This thinking made it possible to intellectually <br>
support the idea of a powerful merchant class that was able to take part in <br>
governing their nation's affairs (and latter international affairs) as <br>
opposed to the European Nobility's preoccupation with "the divine rights of <br>
kings."<br>
<p>
Where things start get interesting in this "progression of progress" line <br>
of thinking is when people start to speculate on the role played by a <br>
virtually empty North American continent (at least from the European point <br>
of view) with it's limitless natural resources on western development and <br>
capitalism. Many years ago while I was in college I went to  Mexico to <br>
study land reform issues and ran across lots of good books that had some <br>
very different ideas about western progress from the popular ones taught in <br>
this country. I wish I could remember some of the titles but I know if you <br>
look for them you will find them. In fact, I think you will find tons and <br>
tons of written stuff on western progress but (unless things have changed <br>
in the past few years) you will not find very much written on sub-Shari <br>
African culture  -except, of course, how it relates to western <br>
civilization.<br>
<p>
How this fits in with what you are thinking about is I feel that there is <br>
really no way that we can with any confidence understand why western <br>
culture developed the way it did verses other cultures because we simply <br>
don't know anything about these other cultures. The questions that you are <br>
raising are also very revealing about us in the west because they force us <br>
to run smack dab into our western ethnocentric blind spot.<br>
