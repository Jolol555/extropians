Brent Allsop &lt;allsop@swttools.fc.hp.com&gt; wrote in response to<br>
Hagbard Celine's &lt;hagbard@ix.netcom.com&gt; question:<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; What changes in your personal lifestyle have you taken to increase</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the amount of extropy therein (changes = mental, physical, social,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; etc.)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	I'm loving the responses to this question.  I hope what I say</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; here isn't to far off of what was being asked for.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	I was raised in the "LDS" (The Mormons) church.  One of their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cultural natures is to work very hard to "save" others because of "the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; worth of souls".  "bring, save it be one soul into me, how great shall</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be your joy with him in the kingdom..."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	Mormons believe they have the keys to eternal exalted life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If you choose their way you will get it, if not it is choosing death.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They believe all are free to choose one or the other and they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; continually try to convince others to choose their way.  The Book of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Mormon, 2 Nephi 2:27 says:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    "they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    might be miserable like unto himself."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	These philosophies have spilled over into my extropian way of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; life.  In other words, I think that they have things kind of right but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; just backwards.  If one only follows their teachings, doesn't choose</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to do more than have faith and pray and go to the temple... if one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; doesn't do the research work required and if one isn't cryonically</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; preserved..., it is choosing death.  Since I'd hate to have my friends</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and family miss the opportunity to make it to eternal life, I take any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; advantage I can (without being to much of an obnoxious pain), to say</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; things like: "In a thousand years we'll know who is right, who made</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the right choice, who is alive in a glorious, eternal life, heaven and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; who is miserable in hell, sheo, or the grave."  I try to get as many</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as possible to not give into the temptings of those that apparently</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto [themselves]".</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	In other words I'm more or less crying warnings of hellfire</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and damnation to them for making incorrect choices.  I know this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; against the usual extropian nature to live, choose, and let others</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; live and choose what they may.  But, possibly because of my LDS</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; background, I have troubles with this.  I don't want to be the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; one of my LDS family and friends that can be "brought back".  I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; if more extropians took this attitude about getting the critical words</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of warning out cryonics and extropianism would spread much faster.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (Not to mention the corresponding research effort and funding... ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hear about the quantities of LDS owned assets and the amount of works</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and money that goes into the growing number of temples...?)  Many</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; people just aren't yet blessed with enough smarts and must be told</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; what to do with powerful and explicit warnings of how extreme the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; consequences are.  It's sad, believing that their promises of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; salvation are false, to see so many belief systems like LDS be so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; successful at preying on such people that so desperately want to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; told what to do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	</i><br>
I come from a faintly catholic background, so I can more or less <br>
relate to this. To me transhumanism isn't just a the most rational<br>
choice, but maybe also a sort of substitute for religion (maybe<br>
it is for more people, it has been argued that we all have a "religion<br>
slot" in our mind that needs to be filled). Imo, the transhuman way<br>
is presently the only one that (probably) leads to eternal life and<br>
happiness, the others lead to needless suffering and ultimately<br>
*always* [permanent] death. <br>
 <br>
IMHO, the ultra strong tolerance meme that's generally associated<br>
with transhumanistic "ideologies" like extropianism is one of it's<br>
weakest points. "Free choice", "free will" etc. are considered sacred, and<br>
this would be fine in a society of rational individuals, but not in a<br>
society where most people are a couple short of eir sixpack. For example,<br>
if your friends and/or relatives don't want to be frozen after death<br>
[assuming you had the power to do it], would you do it anyway [ I sure<br>
would ], or would you let them rot because of your principles? <br>
 <br>
Reason overrides free choice. Most people are a bit like dumb kids<br>
with a lot of maturing to do. Restricting their freedom in order to<br>
keep them from harm is imo morally perfectly acceptable. They<br>
will thank you later for it, and if not, they can still kill themselves<br>
later...<br>
 <br>
Many are called, but only few [will] answer...I strongly believe you<br>
are more or less "destined" to become transhuman...like someone<br>
said:"you either feel immediately attracted to it, or you hate it". It's<br>
a very special privilege. This would mean that your warnings (about the<br>
flaws of other ideologies and the consequences: paradise lost) can only<br>
"convince" those who were in fact transhumanists all along.<br>
Real believers connot be convinced, no fact will make them question<br>
their beliefs (be they religious or otherwise). You can only save<br>
them by "force".<br>
 <br>
Let's assemble the flock by spreading the Word, and forcefully<br>
save some sinners while we're at it. After all, we just *might* be the<br>
future masters of the universe.<br>
 <br>
Amen<br>
 <br>
Oh, and money is needed, lots of money for the Good Cause...why<br>
aren't y'all getting disgustingly rich with all your knowledge and <br>
connections ??<br>
