     Anders Sandberg noted:<br>
     <br>
     I have noticed that more interesting things happen every month<br>
     now than it happened during whole years of my childhood (of course, I<br>
     didn't see it like that then), so rotations about the sun doesn't say<br>
     much. Maybe one should have something like proper time in relativity,<br>
     "proper mental age" (this may be relevant to your ethics paper?).<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight adds:<br>
     <br>
     This got me to thinking that we do place tremendous emphasis on our <br>
     "year" concept like it *means* something.  Granted, cycles are <br>
     something to set your watch by &lt;G&gt;.<br>
     <br>
     Shortly after the release of "Schindler's List", I saw Dustin Hoffman <br>
     being interviewed on Larry King Live.  I had always wondered, being <br>
     rather a rebel in nature, how SO MANY people were just shepherded into <br>
     boxcars and systematically annihalated.  Dustin really opened up <br>
     something for me when he said noted that Eastern Europeans were <br>
     exposed to as much information, over the course of their lives, as an <br>
     average modern American gets in a day!<br>
     <br>
     Now, accuracy aside, I thought that was a fascinating notion.  So, <br>
     even though people of more agrarian times lived how ever many years, a <br>
     young person in their teens has experiencially far exceeded them in <br>
     many situations.  Notwithstanding the sentimental rites of passage we <br>
     put on such things as first kiss, first sex, first job, first car, <br>
     first house..., I think people like Eliezer have assimilated knowledge <br>
     and a perspective that is rare and extraordinary.  He also has <br>
     extraordinary tools at his disposal for acquiring vast amounts of <br>
     knowledge, something unprecedented in human civilization.<br>
     <br>
     Here's too peeling off the next layer of the universal onion!  <br>
     Eliezer, I wish you peace, love and personal fulfillment, regardless <br>
     of how many seasons you are here.  It took me twice as long as you <br>
     have rotated around to get some of those fundamentals but as the <br>
     nature vs. nurture volley goes, balance them as good as you can.<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
