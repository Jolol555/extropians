Am I the only person who thinks widespreed nanotech is a good thing?<br>
<p>
Let's imagine we have our nanotech, amazingly it appeared over night, and now<br>
we have to decide to either give it to everyone or give it to some world<br>
power.  Now, we know that if we give it to everyone we're likely to give it<br>
to someone who wants to destroy the world.  If we give it to this 'world<br>
power' they can take care of it and make sure it doesn't get into the wrong<br>
hands.<br>
<p>
What kind of person wants to be a 'world power'?  What kind of person wants<br>
to be solely in charge of the most destructive force in the world?  It's more<br>
likely to be the kind of person you don't want in charge, who wants to be in<br>
charge.  Think you can choose the right person?  Obviously you do, that's why<br>
you vote.<br>
<p>
So our world power decides to kill a few people, maybe not *everyone*, but<br>
just the one's that oppose his/her views.  Who's going to defend you, you<br>
gave all the power to that person who's now going to screw you over!  Oh! but<br>
this is going to be the great all-knowing extropian entity.. have you learned<br>
nothing?<br>
<p>
Now let's say we gave it to everyone.  This isn't about the technology, it's<br>
about the knowledge, so we don't have to build our metaphorical nukes and<br>
distribute them in the play ground.  "Everyone's right to his or her nuke"<br>
isn't about nukes, it's about peoples right to information - all information.<br>
 So, everyone has the means and the ability to make whatever they want in<br>
nanotech.  Someone, somewhere is working away building their back goo.<br>
 Meanwhile *everyone everywhere* are working towards ways to improve their<br>
defense in case this someone somewhere attacks (the people are aware of the<br>
danger, because nothing is hiden from them).  Who's going to win - billions<br>
of people who want to live, or one that wants to kill?<br>
