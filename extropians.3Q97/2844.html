<i>&gt; </i><br>
Yes, Pi is an Areal value, and the definition provided above is an Areal<br>
algorithm...... As for computing the trillionth digit, there are more<br>
complex derivations which will yield the trillionth digit with enough<br>
calculation. (I believe the last reported value for Pi has some 52<br>
gigadigits....)<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Ah, serious confusion here. Indeed, to our perception, the Mandelbrot</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Set is infinitely complex, in its overwhelming amount of detail. In</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;terms of complexity theory, the Mandelbrot Set is a simple object.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In terms of which complexity theory? You act as if complexity is a clear cut</i><br>
<i>&gt; obvious idea universally agreed upon. It's not.</i><br>
<p>
Please provide a summary of the various current interpetations of<br>
"complexity". For the moment I am going with the definition mentioned<br>
below. However, I'd like to know more here...<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;The mathematical definition of complexity is basically the length of</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;the string describing the algorithm used to create the object.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously we must talk about the minimum string or it is not unique, but as</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've already mentioned, it's been proven that we can never know if a smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt; string that does the same thing can be found, so if this is the definition of</i><br>
<i>&gt; complexity it's not a very useful concept because we can never know waht it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is for anything.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Misplaced precision here. Yes, finding n, the minimum length of string S<br>
within a propositional system L is similar to the halting problem and in<br>
most cases impossible may be true (and proven as you say). However,<br>
finding a string S1 of 2n or less in length may be easily findable. 2n<br>
is good enough for this line of argument.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Three questions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Exactly what is this property you call "physical" and how can I test to</i><br>
<i>&gt;    see if an object has it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Each element of the object can be one for one mappped into the integers,<br>
and the number of integers required is less than the number of integers<br>
required to count the number of particles in the Universe. The Universe<br>
is presumed to contain a finite number of particles, appproximately<br>
10^80.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 2) If Mreal is a subset of Preal and I have the idea of a fire breathing</i><br>
<i>&gt;    dragon in my mind, does that mean that dragons are physically real?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
The dragons are not, but the idea of the dragons is Mreal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3) If the integers or the Mandelbrot Set are not part of Mreal then how do</i><br>
<i>&gt;    we know anything about them?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
the idea of the integers and the idea of the Mandelbrot set, and the<br>
various theorems, lemmas, etc, are all statable as Mreal finite length<br>
strings.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;The definitions or algorithms for these objects are Mreal, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;therefore Preal. The  definitions are not complex, and the sets</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;themselves are.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The definition is real but the set is not? Can you give an example of</i><br>
<i>&gt; something the definition has but the set does not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Peano Postulates = Mreal set of strings, finitely statable.<br>
Integers = Areal, not finitely listable.<br>
Application of Peano Postulates results in the Integers. Note the term<br>
"Integers" is Mreal, but the set it names is Areal.<br>
<p>
It's a tradeoff. The Mreal strings are much more manipulatable, as in<br>
provability, than the sets themselves, which due to their infinite size,<br>
cannot be manipulated. Mreal we can work with, Areal is not. We can in a<br>
Mreal way discuss the Areal, which is what this thread is doing.<br>
