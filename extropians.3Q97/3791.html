<i>&gt;But in their culture this was considered 'acceptible behaviour'. This was</i><br>
<i>&gt;my original point (several posts ago ;-) What is justifiable and what is</i><br>
<i>&gt;not is dependend on culture, time, situation. No absolute right or wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt;exists.</i><br>
<p>
Are you familiar with the old proverb attributed to Abraham Lincoln (though<br>
I suspect it's a lot older than he):<br>
<p>
   "How many legs does a dog have, if you call a tail a leg?"<br>
<p>
   [sucker answers: "Five."]<br>
<p>
   "No, four. _Calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg._"<br>
<p>
_Maybe_ no absolute right or wrong exists. But saying what you have said is<br>
no proof of this, just blind assertion.<br>
<p>
I'm a believer in cultural relativism, but I take it to mean what it means<br>
to anthropologists, which is that if you are going to understand an aspect<br>
of a culture you have to examine it in context. It does not mean that all<br>
cultures are equal, nor does it mean that everything is relative.<br>
<p>
As a concrete example: if you were to be put to death while traveling in<br>
certain parts of the world for the crime of sticking chewing gum to some<br>
part of a rapid transit train (I am not making this up), would you smile<br>
and say, "No problem, I understand, it's all relative, in fact since I'm<br>
_here_, I believe it's JUST and GOOD that I die..."?<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;Please explain to me how commercial governement/legal system works?</i><br>
<i>&gt;The governement may not be all that nice and efficient but giving control</i><br>
<i>&gt;over the ICBM'ss to an organisation who's primary purpose it is to make a</i><br>
<i>&gt;yearly profit seems rather risky to me.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm. You mean that having nuclear weapons in the hands of organizations<br>
that have, in times as recent as ten years ago, as their stated purpose,<br>
the destruction of capitalism--is somehow better? <br>
<p>
Weapons of mass destruction are perceived as a toughie, but I'll let<br>
someone else tackle that one.<br>
<p>
Consider *this*, however: if things progress as many extropians expect or<br>
hope or are working toward, eventually individuals will possess<br>
energy-manipulation capacities in the equivalent-megaton-yield range. It<br>
doesn't matter if you call the technology that provides this "dilithium<br>
crystals", "shipstones" or "nukes"...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I could think of some situations (in theorie at least) were I would put the</i><br>
<i>&gt;interest of a number of persosns (the group) above the interst of one</i><br>
<i>&gt;induhvidual. </i><br>
<p>
As can I. The question is, am I free to choose? Or did the group choose for<br>
me? *That's* the crux, and one of the things that keeps the same old<br>
arguments going.<br>
