Speaking of Theories of Everything...<br>
<p>
Browsing the web I see that David Deutsch, one of the principle originators<br>
of the quantum computing concept, has a new book coming out called<br>
"The Fabric of Reality", about how close we are to a ToE.  From the<br>
web page at<br>
<a href="http://eve.physics.ox.ac.uk/Personal/deutsch/FabricOfReality/FoR.html">http://eve.physics.ox.ac.uk/Personal/deutsch/FabricOfReality/FoR.html</a><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Fabric of Reality presents a startlingly integrated, rational and</i><br>
<i>&gt; optimistic world view - the result of taking seriously the deepest ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt; of modern science and the philosophy of science. The four main strands</i><br>
<i>&gt; of explanation involved in this synthesis are quantum physics and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; theories of evolution, computation, and knowledge. These strands may</i><br>
<i>&gt; seem unrelated, yet this book shows that they are so closely intertwined</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we cannot properly understand any one of them without reference to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the other three. Considered in isolation, each of them has explanatory</i><br>
<i>&gt; gaps which have inhibited people from accepting them as being literally</i><br>
<i>&gt; true. But considered jointly, they reveal a unified fabric of reality</i><br>
<i>&gt; that is objective and comprehensible, and in which human actions and</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas play essential roles.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The most profound of the four strands is quantum theory, which contains</i><br>
<i>&gt; our most fundamental knowledge of the physical world. Taken literally, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; implies that there are many universes 'parallel' to the one we see around</i><br>
<i>&gt; us, and that they are detectable through the astonishing phenomenon of</i><br>
<i>&gt; quantum interference. The multiplicity of universes turns out to be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; key to the unification of the four strands. For example, both the growth</i><br>
<i>&gt; of scientific knowledge and the evolution of biological adaptations are</i><br>
<i>&gt; best understood as multi-universe phenomena: normally, universes tend</i><br>
<i>&gt; to become less alike with time, and the only two known processes capable</i><br>
<i>&gt; of making them more alike are biological evolution and human thought.</i><br>
<p>
I thought that last sentence was interesting.  I suppose the idea is that<br>
randomness usually makes things diverge, while selection processes are<br>
convergent in that they seek out optimal solutions.<br>
<p>
Short reviews on the web page suggest that the book is going to be well<br>
received and influential.<br>
