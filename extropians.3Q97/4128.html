It has been awhile since I have looked into RTGs (Radioactive Thermal<br>
Generators) but your statements are essentially correct.  RTGs are powered<br>
by Pu-238.  It is a non-fissile isotope of Plutonium that has a half-life<br>
of just under 88 years.  It decays by spontaneous fission and energetic<br>
alphas and so generates quite a bit of heat.  The fact that Pu-238 is a<br>
good heat source is what makes it so useful on space missions to the outer<br>
planets, particular in view of the short life of batteries and the<br>
insufficiency of solar energy for necessary energy.<br>
<p>
The "problem" associated with Plutonium in RTGs is political and has<br>
nothing to do with either health, safety, or proliferation.  Much of the<br>
hysteria associated with Plutonium RTGs dates back to the Goffman-Tamplin<br>
"hot particle" hypothesis about plutonium toxicity.  The assumption was<br>
that inhaled plutonium in even the smallest amounts would produce cancer.<br>
This hypothesis was invalidated early on but has remained part of the<br>
mythos of anti-nuclear and anti-technology groups.  A point that I used to<br>
make when I debated the anti-nuclears back in the late 70s and early 80s<br>
was that it was reliably estimated that atmospheric testing of nuclear<br>
weapons has uniformly dispersd something between 7-10 MILLION tonnes of<br>
plutonium.  Thus, if you go for a walk outside, you WILL be exposed to<br>
plutonium and if you work in your garden you will exposed even more if you<br>
kick up any dust.  If Goffman and Tamplin were correct we would all be<br>
dead now.<br>
<p>
While I am not saying that Plutonium RTGs are benign, the concern focused<br>
on them is way out of proportion to the actual risk.  Frankly, I consider<br>
the kinetic energy of a reentering probe and the possible damage it might<br>
produce as being more a matter of concern than the onboard plutonium. <br>
