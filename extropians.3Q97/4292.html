For those who think I'm turning into a socialist, I have thought of this<br>
myself, and am not sure why I didn't mention it myself.  It's obviously<br>
the most gradual transition, and theoretically should handle any<br>
population explosion problem -- parents have to think about passing on<br>
their capital (if mortal) or saving enough dividends to accumulate a new<br>
reserve for their children.  <br>
<p>
I think the Culture's population control method is social<br>
pressure/fashion; it's gauche to have lots of kids.  It can be done<br>
anyway, but the Culture can afford the occasional large family and if<br>
you believe humans are largely determined by education than those kids<br>
are no more likely to have large families of their own, or at least the<br>
evolutionary pressure has not been visible in 11,000 years.  But like<br>
I've said, I don't read Banks for believable economics.<br>
<p>
John Clark claimed that this wouldn't provide really guaranteed income.<br>
In case of war, yes, but if you own power, material, and factories, and<br>
people remain civilized, the sudden advent of picotech, say, shouldn't<br>
hamper you.  You have the same power supply, property, stuff, and tools<br>
as before.  The catch, I suppose, would be stock in a small slice of the<br>
economy, and losing your trading partners; or a small slice of stock in<br>
a factory, which went out of business somehow.<br>
<p>
} I wouldn't have a problem with tax incentives to promote wider stock<br>
} ownership. (That just means taking less away from people who invest.)<br>
 <br>
Those don't already exist?  I've heard the left say capital faces lower<br>
taxes than labor.  A different concern: do taxes favor low dividend<br>
stock which rises in price over stable stock that issues continuous <br>
dividends?<br>
<p>
Of course, tax structures can be affected by attitudes, which I mentioned<br>
I was trying to change.  For the Singularitarians out there, the<br>
attitudes of whoever makes an SI (what did that stand for again?) will<br>
probably affect its values and behavior, through design, copying, or<br>
counter-reaction.  There are people here who's child-SI would probably<br>
happily view humans as simple feedstock.  Even people who say they think<br>
that'd be a bad thing could cause that, through seeing it as inevitable<br>
and not worth fighting.  If an SI pops up 8.5 years from now like Dan<br>
Clemmensen claims I'd much rather it resemble a Culture Mind, and treat<br>
us indulgently, than a Vinge Power, and treat us callously.<br>
<p>
Although it occurred to me that the Powers beyond the Powers actually<br>
must be more like Minds than I thought.  If the Zones were set up to<br>
protect and nurture newcomers, and not a side-effect of an old war, then<br>
the High Powers also thought putting aside material to come up with<br>
new random diversity was worthwhile.  But they didn't want to hang<br>
around us in the meantime, whereas Minds are happy to have humans as<br>
"passengers, pets, and parasites", probably interacting with them the<br>
way we play postal chess, or raise plants.<br>
