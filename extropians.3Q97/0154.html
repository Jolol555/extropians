I have argued on this list several times that for human beings to<br>
coexist as individuals, on any platform, each must give up a measure of<br>
his or her freedom (freedom to kill, freedom to steal, etc.)<br>
Unfortunately I see no other way to do this, and also ensure that one<br>
gives up no more freedom than another, other than a social contract.<br>
People disagree as to the scope and extent of this contract, but I'm the<br>
only one that seems to think that this is government any way you slice<br>
it. And unfortunately, once you sign the contract, you no longer own<br>
yourself entirely.<br>
