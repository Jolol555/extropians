<p>
A consistently recurring idea throughout the Extro3 conference was<br>
that Identity is a matter of goals, values, intentions.  Max talked<br>
about offloading tasks such as memory, physical upkeep, presentation,<br>
and even some personality traits to technological agents.  What's<br>
left as "you" is how you choose to use them.<br>
<p>
Sasha spoke of the continuing entities in a cybernetic world as<br>
"teleological threads" (perhaps a bit frightening to those of us<br>
who have written multi-threaded software:), with the proportion<br>
of technology to nature being used to implement them increasing.<br>
<p>
Kevin Kelly gave a wonderful speech about long-term projects, and<br>
what makes them succeed and fail.  A central idea was that an<br>
institution with goals and values that looks to the future beyond<br>
its present physical existence can persist.<br>
<p>
The same idea could be found in other talks such as the human<br>
germline engineering one (after the speciation explosion, how<br>
do you identify a being?) and the Jupiter-brian talk (after we are<br>
all distributed intelligences in a large network, where are "we"?<br>
"We" are at the Instruction Pointer of our thread, of course,<br>
waiting for our timeslice to intend for one more cycle).<br>
<p>
Identity = teleology.  I intend, therefore I am.<br>
<p>
It is a natural consequence of this, then, to value freedom<br>
over biological life, because the former gives us identity, not<br>
the latter.  With past and present technologies, the only way<br>
to continue one's identity was to instill your values in others,<br>
such as children or church-fellows.  We now have the technology<br>
on the horizon to maintain ourselves indefinitely, so we may<br>
need those other means less.<br>
<p>
We fear death not because it ends biological processes, but<br>
because it ends our ability to intend.  People risk their<br>
lives for freedom because freedom is the goal, and life is the<br>
means, not the end.<br>
<p>
I, for one, presently intend to preserve myself both in a Dewar<br>
and in a perpetual web site.  Both will be expensive.  If it<br>
came down to a decision on my deathbed that I could afford to<br>
be suspended only at the cost of giving up the web site that<br>
contained a lifetime of values and goals, I'd be inclined to<br>
keep the web site.<br>
