<p>
In some tech fields this is a regular phenomenon.  I suspect the delay is<br>
due primarily to the fact that the analysts are not technically savvy<br>
enough to determine whether the announcement is important or not (among the<br>
many that are routinely made) and are forced to wait for some science types<br>
to speak up.  It is very feasible that money could be made on this<br>
phenomenon if you tracked the science news carefully and were knowledgeable<br>
enough to determine the market reaction.  Some announcements, on the other<br>
hand, produce a Pavlovian response in stock analysts that gives almost no<br>
lead time.  In these cases you can make money only if you are able to<br>
predict the market position after you take cascade and feedback effects<br>
into consideration.  Actually, I find stock analysts' Pavlovian response's<br>
to be fairly easy targets for making money, primarily because they are so<br>
predictable.<br>
<p>
Another related phenomena is that even when the analysts respond quickly,<br>
related companies often experience a similar stock boost, but usually after<br>
a short delay.  This varies widely, dependant mostly on the particular<br>
industry and company involved.  <br>
<p>
I am currently working on software algorithms (part of a larger software<br>
package under design) to predict the delay, cascade, and feedback factors<br>
as the result of such technology announcements.  Accurate probability<br>
assessment in such situations is a non-trivial computational problem,<br>
although the human brain can often "intuit" the situation with training or<br>
experience.<br>
