I thought that this might be of interest to some of the computer<br>
professionals on the extropians list. If I had to take a wild guess,<br>
I'd figure that this is going to go the way of the MicroChannel<br>
bus (for those of you who remember that).  The open PCI bus seems<br>
much better established right now than ISA was at the time of<br>
MicroChannel, when ISA was already beginning to show its flaws.<br>
Without Intel's participation, I doubt i2o is going to get very<br>
far, and given that Intel has been a heavy supporter (e. g. the<br>
Triton chipsets) of the PCI bus so far, I don't know why they'd<br>
want to backtrack.  But from a memetic-evolution perspective, this<br>
looks like a bunch of yeast cells getting together to form a<br>
"Committee to Discourage Sexual Reproduction". At a simpler<br>
level, this is just trade-unionism, I guess.<br>

Check out <a href="http://www.i2osig.org/">http://www.i2osig.org/</a> "i2o" is a developing "non-proprietary"<br>
standard for high-performance computer peripherals. Unfortunately, it's a<br>
closed standard, it requires a NDA, and you need a license to develop<br>
software for it. Their terms are:<br>
<p>
        Membership is $5000/year.<br>
        You can't develop software or hardware for it without being a member.<br>
        You can't disclose source code for your drivers.<br>
        You must stop making hardware or software for it if you lose membership.<br>
        Members can vote out other members.<br>
<p>
The backers of this are Microsoft, Novell, Hewlet-Packard, and NETFrame.<br>
It looks as if the i2o agreements are deliberately written to exclude free<br>
software.<br>
<p>
I suspect that if i2o peripherals become popular, free operating systems<br>
will be locked out from running on PC hardware.<br>
<p>
Please take a look at this and give me a reality check.<br>
<p>
        Thanks<br>
