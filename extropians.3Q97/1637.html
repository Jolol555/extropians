I have no idea how minority politics are handled in Brazil. The USA<br>
values individualism and denying one's identity by attempting to appear<br>
as one is not does not play well here as a minority viewpoint. Of<br>
course there are many who alter their appearance for the usual reasons<br>
of power and reaction to oppression. You might log onto one of the<br>
alt newsgroups for blacks and ask what the term "oreo" means...<br>
<p>

Three remarks, just shy of serious flaming:<br>
<p>
1. I find your attitude offensive in the extreme. I perceive it as<br>
extremely paternalistic, patriarchial and condescending.<br>
<p>
2. Why don't you ASK some Blacks what they think of all this. Kennita,<br>
do you want to say anything??<br>
<p>
3. My limited impressions and very, very limited knowledge of things<br>
Brazilian indicate a very biased male oriented Spanish culture in the<br>
upper echelons of business and academia. Any comments?<br>
