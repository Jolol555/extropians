While "in group" elitism might account for some of the special<br>
terminology (especially when that terminology gets used to<br>
cover-up wild-eyed speculation as fact -- vis. much of the stuff<br>
published about approaches to education or economics or politics),<br>
another factor raises its head.<br>
<p>
Our languages, English as one example, while rich and evocative,<br>
also come from cultures where the twins of animism and<br>
anthropomorphism run rampant.  A flower 'wants' to look at the<br>
sky, a rock 'desires' to fall to earth because of an 'affinity,'<br>
an electron 'gets attracted' by protons and 'repelled' by other<br>
electrons.  A Golden Retriever 'loves' its master, and "Gaia"<br>
'feels' tremendous disappointment and despair at our behaviors.<br>
<p>
Something, such as quantum physics, simply *cannot* get explained<br>
in a language that does not allow for the structural relationships<br>
of quantum physics.  A language, based on animistic assumptions,<br>
and human-native sensory capabilities, cannot suffice.  People can<br>
make explanations in everyday English that satisfy -- but that<br>
misinform.  People can make explanations that have coherence with<br>
current experimental results -- but those explanations fail to<br>
satisfy.<br>
<p>
As a particularly blatant, and quantitatively absurd, example,<br>
I've known people who simply *cannot* accept that the construct of<br>
'color' cannot apply to an electron.  "Well, sure -- they're too<br>
small to see, and even much, much, much smaller than a wavelength<br>
of light -- but still, with good enough instruments, instruments<br>
that can see better than us, we should be able to tell their<br>
colors.  Everything has a color."  Can you imagine trying to<br>
explain an electron as a wave-function to someone hung-up on<br>
"everything has a color?"<br>
<p>
Without recognizing what we do, most of us make language fixed,<br>
and use it as a criterion for "what makes sense" rather than<br>
allowing our senses (and our sensory extensions, such as<br>
microscopes, voltmeters, etc.) to declare what "makes sense" and<br>
adapting our language to express what we sense.  (If we did that,<br>
we might more readily recognize non-sense.  Propaganda, for<br>
example, depends on symbolic-coherence as something sufficient for<br>
convincing.  People say, "That makes sense," even when they have<br>
no way of sensing or measuring what gets said except by reference<br>
to not-sensible and not measurable symbologies.)<br>
<p>
People working in advanced areas of science come to quickly<br>
recognize that language *cannot* get used as a criterion for what<br>
they find.  The 'paradox' of "wave" or "particle" for a photon,<br>
for example, represents a *linguistic* paradox -- one that can<br>
result in unending linguistic debate so long as language operates<br>
as a tacit criterion for fact, but one where the debate evaporates<br>
into irrelevance once people decide to characterize the<br>
interactions of a photon, without regard to language -- inventing<br>
a new language for that characterization if necessary.  And such<br>
necessity occurs.<br>
<p>
Once language gets recognized as a symbology, and a symbology not<br>
inherently able to represent all relationships that we can<br>
characterize, then the need for a revised and extended symbology<br>
becomes evident -- unless we fall into the all-too-common trap of<br>
assuming that if our language doesn't cover it, it ain't there.<br>
<p>
Reconsider your comments in that light.<br>
