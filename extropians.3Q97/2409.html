<p>
     Chad, the evil white-collar executive Aaron Eckhart plays in Neil <br>
     LaBute's "In the Company of Men," is so willfully destructive he hopes <br>
     his latest victim will reach for sleeping pills once he's through with <br>
     her.<br>
<p>
     In the opening scenes, Chad and his pushover pal Howard (Matt Malloy) <br>
     set out to seduce Christine (Stacy Edwards), a deaf office worker. Their <br>
     goal: to simultaneously dump her and avenge themselves on women in <br>
     general.<br>
<p>
     When LaBute and Eckhart attended the premiere of the movie at the <br>
     Sundance Film Festival last January, they weren't prepared for the <br>
     on-the-street reaction afterwards. Although it received a Sundance <br>
     filmmaker's trophy in the drama category, some accused the film itself <br>
     of being misogynistic and cruel.<br>
<p>
     "Women would come up to Aaron and say, `I hate you,' " said LaBute when <br>
     he brought the movie to the Seattle International Film Festival in May <br>
     (it opens for a regular run here today). "Of course he'd remind them <br>
     that `Yyou don't hate me, you hate the character.' "<br>
<p>
      LaBute thinks one reason Chad is so despised is that the story line <br>
      doesn't provide an obvious punishment for him or tie everything up <br>
      neatly.<br>
<p>
     "That's when you've signed your death warrant," said LaBute, who <br>
     welcomes controversy. "Polarizing opinion is no worry to me. There's no <br>
     right or wrong answer to a film. My most feared responses are `That was <br>
     interesting' or `That was different.' "<br>
<p>
     LaBute set out to create a yin-yang relationship between the handsome, <br>
     aggressive Chad and the unassertive Howard, who goes along with the plan <br>
     but eventually wants out. As the story gradually shifts to Christine's <br>
     point of view, their scheming looks increasingly obsessive and pathetic.<br>
<p>
     "For drama's sake you create types of a sort," said LaBute. "Chad is the <br>
     poster boy for the one side you're trying to distill. People are a <br>
     little taken aback by him; they're hoping he's actually fallen for her. <br>
     They don't know what a viper he is; they don't understand his need for <br>
     control.<br>
<p>
     "The way they begin it, it's almost a lark. You want him to be a better <br>
     guy than he is. And Chad has an advantage: The beautiful people get a <br>
     little more rope in life."<br>
<p>
     Eckhart is an old college friend who has appeared in several of LaBute's <br>
     plays as well as the upcoming Kevin Kline movie, "In and Out." LaBute <br>
     cast him because he could make the character ambiguous sexually and <br>
     otherwise, suggesting "15 reasons for what he's done."<br>
<p>
     He thinks Chad is "not unlike a serial killer. He has to take things <br>
     closer and closer to the edge, asking `How's that feel?' He has to know <br>
     how the pain feels, and he's going to take this too far at some point. <br>
     There's a synapse there that isn't firing emotionally."<br>
<p>
     At the same time, he feels a kinship with the character.<br>
<p>
     "Chad is in me, he's in everybody, I think. I've met people as bad as <br>
     Chad, though they had none of the charm."<br>
<p>
     LaBute believes that reluctant identification with the charismatic Chad <br>
     could be a reason for the angry response, although initially he doubted <br>
     that the script would have that kind of appeal. He shot it in less than <br>
     two weeks on a tiny budget.<br>
<p>
     "I didn't know there'd be an audience for it," said Labute, though he <br>
     did guess it when Sundance called to talk about showing it. "Then you <br>
     know you have a topic for discussion."<br>
<p>
     He sees the script as an outgrowth of his stage work: "Betrayal is a <br>
     subject I keep returning to in my plays, which tend to be a little <br>
     darker in spirit than most."<br>
<p>
     LaBute, a 34-year-old Mormon who met Eckhart at Brigham Young <br>
     University, spent his formative years in the Northwest.<br>
<p>
     Born in Detroit, he was a child when his parents moved to Spokane, where <br>
     he spent the next 15 years. He once worked at the city's best-known art <br>
     house, the Magic Lantern theater, visiting Seattle to see foreign films <br>
     that never crossed the mountains. He was a movie buff even as a child.<br>
<p>
     "I have to credit my mother for that," said LaBute. "She's always been a <br>
     voracious reader and film watcher. The first thing I can remember is <br>
     waking up in the middle of `Gone With the Wind' at the Dishman theater <br>
     in Spokane. The red was so overwhelming."<br>
<p>
     After high school, LaBute attended three universities, enrolled in the <br>
     graduate dramatic writing program at New York University, wrote several <br>
     plays ("Lepers," "A Gaggle of Saints") and moved to Fort Wayne, Ind., <br>
     where he lives with his wife and two children.<br>
<p>
     "I always created quickly," he said. "Money (for film production) was <br>
     what I didn't have. With theater you could work much more rapidly."<br>
<p>
     Eventually he was able to raise enough to shoot "In the Company of Men," <br>
     which is essentially a three-character story designed around a <br>
     minimalist budget.<br>
<p>
     "Casting was done with literally just three phone calls," he said. <br>
     "Aaron always wanted to do something with me, Stacy had done a play of <br>
     mine, and Matt I knew. I knew they had theater training, and I knew we <br>
     had only 11 days."<br>
<p>
     Abandoning the vogue for MTV-style cutting, LaBute's movie consists <br>
     mostly of long takes that allow the actors to develop more sustained <br>
     performances.<br>
<p>
     "They knew there was no way to cheat," said LaBute. "I'm a big hater of <br>
     establishing shots and inserts. Editing is a lie anyway. And I'm a big <br>
     fan of actors and what they can do. I can sit and watch two people talk <br>
     forever as long as the talk is good."<br>
