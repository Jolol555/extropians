Dear nice people,<br>
When I asked for information about the possible substitution of a fuel<br>
cell operated by hydrogen as a substitute for the internal combustion<br>
engine as proposed and developed by Mercedes, my main concerns, among<br>
others, however, was the possible necessity of re-tooling all of the<br>
automobile plants in the world. The other possible effects would include a<br>
change in some of the balances in powers due to the possible lessening of<br>
dependence on mid-east oil, the controls --if any -- over the production<br>
and distribution of hydrogen as a fuel, the ecological effects and any and<br>
all possible socio-economic changes and other such contingencies.<br>
<p>
The dialogue that ensued about the viability and characteristics of<br>
hydrogen were quite interesting and enlightening, however. <br>
It never ceases to amaze me how when you go looking for information,<br>
dialogues  often ensue in which you learn about things that you never<br>
considered.<br>
Thank you all,<br>
AMG<br>

Could we have this in English please?<br>
<p>
: The person talking about hydrogen flammability limits was very likely<br>
: confusing hydrogen in oxygen limits with hydrogen in AIR limits... two<br>
: very different situations. Yes, flammability limits in OXYGEN are from<br>
4.7<br>
: to 15 and 90 to 93.9<br>
<p>
Four limits?  Two ranges?  What do the numbers mean?<br>
<p>
: with detonation limits in between (15 to 90% by volume) [...]<br>
: The flammability limits of hydrogen in AIR are 4.0 to 18.2 and again<br>
above<br>
: detonation limits at from 58.9 to 75%  with the 18.2 to 58.9% by volume<br>
<p>
Oh, it's parts per hundred?  But which way does the ratio run?<br>
<p>
"It's so simple, so very simple, that only a child can do it." (TL)<br>
<p>
: zone between the detonation limits this is a fuel it has to burn to<br>
work.<br>
: Propane in use everywhere with hardly anyone objecting has DETONATION<br>
: limits from 2.1 to 9.5 in AIR! (would prefer to use hydrogen)<br>
