My first, and IMHO most important, step was when I realized that how<br>
I felt was entirely up to me. If I felt depressed, I would not try to<br>
find a way out of my situation, while if I felt happy and confident I<br>
had much better chances of finding a solution to whatever problem I<br>
had. So I simply decided to become happy, and have remained that ever<br>
since. <br>
<p>
Physically, I recently (this January) started to train ninjutsu,<br>
which I think is a very transhumanist martial art form. It has<br>
several advantages: increased exercise (very necessary) and awareness<br>
of my body, less fear of physical danger (one should treat it with<br>
caution, but not fear) and plenty of interesting techniques and<br>
metaphors to experiment with. Integrated with this I have made my<br>
diet healthier, learning to enjoy food more.<br>
<p>
Socially I try to seek out intelligent, creative people and discuss<br>
with them; there is little point in dealing with uninteresting,<br>
negative people just due to social customs. I have noticed that there<br>
are no boring subjects if you can find somebody interested in them<br>
who can introduce and enthusiasmate you. Often I notice that it is<br>
possible to act as a catalyst, bringing together great minds so that<br>
they can fire each other. <br>
<p>
Mentally, I have learned to acquire new cognitive tools which I can<br>
use: organizational skills, speed reading, study skills, memory<br>
techniques, a better understanding of how my mind works and a broad<br>
education. "The only skill needed is the skill to learn new skills".<br>
