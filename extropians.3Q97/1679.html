     A colleague and I were discussing the roots of misogyny and homophobia <br>
     today (all this emerged over a discussion of the film "The Crucible"). <br>
      We segued into a discourse about how the end of the Industrial Age <br>
     might signify the cap on the male-dominant well.<br>
     <br>
     It occurs to me that as industrialization wanes in favor of the more <br>
     intellectual pursuits of the Information Age, there will be fertile <br>
     ground for a matriarchal resurgence.  <br>
     <br>
     A matriarchal structure is a more natural social organization simply <br>
     because women are the ones who (could ostensibly) control access to <br>
     conception.  The babies they give birth to are dependent upon them for <br>
     life (not considering at this time, the baby formula vs. mother's milk <br>
     for sustenance caveat).  <br>
     <br>
     When you look at history in Western civilization, males have made it a <br>
     priority to keep women disorganized, first by the creation of the <br>
     family which they themselves were appointed to lead.  Also, setting up <br>
     the preoccupation of physical beauty that creates a false sense of <br>
     competition amongst women by emphasizing vanity which is both a time <br>
     and attention sucking device.  They've had to create and perpetrate <br>
     this man-creator myth.  This has resulted in a social construction of <br>
     females being validated by men, acquiescing to what amounts to their <br>
     fear-based dominion, a house of cards.<br>
     <br>
     In patriarchy, you have these elaborate myths about the great "sky <br>
     father", Yahweh, whoever, "creating life".  Of course, what else could <br>
     compete with the simple truth that life comes from the womb with a <br>
     brief assisting moment from a male?  The social constructs that have <br>
     been put in place don't hold much water when set against the simple <br>
     natural sequence of events that results in the ongoing of the species, <br>
     all made possible in the predominant sense by the female.  Not that <br>
     males aren't necessary, not that it wasn't significant for them to be <br>
     a major brute force dominance during the survival eons.  But once <br>
     civilization set in, they didn't ease off the throttle any...until <br>
     this century.  It seems that women have more than paid them back for <br>
     their necessitated thuggery during the dawn of civilization.<br>
     <br>
     Since survival issues aren't paramount in these much more <br>
     technologically advanced times, it seems only logical that women will <br>
     reclaim their role as the natural life givers, care givers and that <br>
     may likely give way to decision makers and leaders.  Yet still, there <br>
     are the last fervent attempts, the primitive chest beating if you <br>
     will, where men use their trump card, their strength and propensity <br>
     for violence, to delay the inevitable. Of course, a great many of us <br>
     (males) would be content with equality..conceptually anyway. <br>
     <br>
     So, as we reach a period in human civilization where novelty will <br>
     exponentially increase and great change will happen in a cosmological <br>
     flicker, what signs are apparent that women are maneuvering into their <br>
     ascendant positions to take on a more controlling interest in human <br>
     affairs? I've not counted more than a handful of women posting in this <br>
     digest.  Why is that?  <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
