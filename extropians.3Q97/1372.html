<i>&gt;In re Natasha's response to my posting:  I must confess to a bit of </i><br>

<i>&gt;initial statement to include other groups, whereas I originally </i><br>
<i>&gt;understood you to be making an assessment of the power that my </i><br>
<i>&gt;community supposedly has right now.  And, in comparing the two </i><br>
<i>&gt;assessments, I would tend to give more weight to the assessment of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;persons living and working within that community, as I would with </i><br>
<i>&gt;such an assessment about any community or group.</i><br>
<p>
I stand firm on what I have stated in particular that changes happen<br>
regardless of old foggies or hard headed fools. (-;)  I'm amiss at what<br>
other groups you are referring to.  I don't think I mentioned any other<br>
groups.  Although privately E. Shaun and I have been discussing other<br>
"groups" and "individuality" which I don't think were publicly posted.<br>
<p>
Interestingly enough, I did have a long conversation a couple of days ago<br>
with a director of social services at West Hollywood's City Hall.  We<br>
discussed the issues raised on this list.  His comments were very positive.<br>
He attributed much of the strides in the gay and lesbian community as having<br>
been boosted by some organizations in particular and what the future<br>
directions will be.  One aspect of our conversation that I found important<br>
is that the West Hollywood non-discrimination laws have become prototypes<br>
for many communities around the country, and internationally.<br>
<p>
Rather than continue the thread in this direction, I'd rather resume the<br>
initial topic of sex changes if that happens to come up again.  <br>
<p>
Get well! The conference is in 9 days! <br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
