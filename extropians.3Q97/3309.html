<p>
No. It can only give you a second chance at that. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The bigger amount of damage would come from the time I would be in</i><br>
<i>&gt; cryopreservation. I don't have a clue to how much would that be but</i><br>
<i>&gt; we're talking about 50, 100, 200, 500 years! Even more damage is done to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the cells.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, this is likely much less damage than the cryopreservation<br>
process (unless your body is mishandled a lot). Chemical reactions does<br>
for all practical purposes not occur at liquid nitrogen temperatures,<br>
and cosmic radiation damage is not a problem for storage less than<br>
a millennium. See<br>

<i>&gt; Here's my problem, they won't know how the cells were when I died, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; they will just follow a blueprint of 'standard brains' to repair me. My</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem is that, depending on the extent of the damage, I will no longer</i><br>
<i>&gt; be me! I will be a different person because my brain will be changed. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; (or my other me, since that person will no longer be me) might have some</i><br>
<i>&gt; memories of how I used to be but I will be another person.</i><br>
<p>
I think Fred Chamberlain explained it nicely in his talk at Extro3:<br>
identity is a continuum, not binary. So you can be more or less <br>
yourself, the big question is how much cryonics change that. Our<br>
brains constantly change, so if the cryonics-induced change is on<br>
the same order as normal change (or even the major changes brought<br>
about by (say) non-lethal accidents) it could be said to work -<br>
after all, you usually regard yourself as the same person even<br>
after a period of coma and a few broken bones. <br>
<p>
If I was writing the code for the cell repair nanites (for the sake<br>
of humanity, let's hope it will not happen :-), I would probably divide<br>
damage into three classes: <br>
<p>
Simple damage, such as denaturated proteins, cross-links, ruptured<br>
cell membranes and microcracks. This kind can be dealt with fairly<br>
easily by just fixing it, there is an obvious correct solution (OK,<br>
finding that solution might be hard). <br>
<p>
Major cell damage: cells that have been destroyed altogether. I don't<br>
think anybody would object to replacing non-nerve cells with 'standard<br>
cells' based on your own cells (why use anybody else's?). Replacing<br>
neurons is problematic, but if we have a good idea we could always<br>
put in a neuron of the most likely type and connect it to the synapses<br>
we know of; not good at all, but as long as they are fairly few the<br>
change in identity will be very minor.<br>
<p>
Big damage: parts of the body where no information is left; we just<br>
have some hints in the debris left. Here we have to use all the<br>
available knowledge to create a plausible replacement, hoping it<br>
will not be too far off. <br>
<p>
Obviously, if cryonics produces a lot of big damage then it is<br>
likely that the revived "you" would not be much like you. But given<br>
better suspension methods, the first two categories would become more<br>
common, and they do not decrease your identity as much. Ideally<br>
we would only have simple damage, but in real life there will<br>
be some neural major damage (hard to avoid). <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; This reminds me of an interesting problem I once argued about, let's</i><br>
<i>&gt; suppose that scientists find a way to transpose a person to another</i><br>
<i>&gt; distant place, almost instantly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course that one's molecules would have to be disorganized and a mass</i><br>
<i>&gt; of one's molecules would be formed. This mass would then go to the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; place in a few seconds and the molecules would, again, be arranged so</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the body of the person would be a body again, a super computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; would know the exact positions of each atom so that the person who left</i><br>
<i>&gt; location A would be exactly in the same conditions is location B.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you think this is the same person who left or is another?</i><br>
<p>
Now we are getting into the identity question. Most people have different<br>
answers, but a large number of transhumanists seem to be in the pattern-<br>
identity camp: it is the pattern of atoms which makes us us, not which<br>
atoms. So if you could replicate the pattern you would replicate me.<br>
