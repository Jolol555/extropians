<p>
very correct, you've got your logic straight, Socrates is smiling at you<br>
from his grave ;-)<br>
<p>

<i> &gt;philosophy, then please provide a point by point demonstration as to why</i><br>
<i> &gt;these political philosophers are wrong.</i><br>
<p>
I've read some of them, and even if I do not totally agree I find it very<br>
hard to argue against them. But I'm not an economist so that's to be expected.<br>
<p>
I do, however know some stuff about recent history and this taught me that<br>
it is impossible to predict (in advance that is) what the practical<br>
consequences of any new social order will be. Various experiments have been<br>
done during this century, all of them ended in disaster or are still<br>
running without achieving their planned goals so far (Cuba, N-Korea).<br>
<p>
The system called society is, until now anyway, to complex to make a<br>
long-term prediction. Like the wheather, you're dealing with<br>
butterfly-effects (the invention of The Bom, The JFK-assination - all quite<br>
difficult to predict).<br>
<p>
Before 1917 it was very difficult to 'prove' why Karl Marx was so very<br>
wrong, with hindsight things seem a lot clearer.<br>
<p>
I'm not saying Libertarianism could not yield fine results, I'm saying we<br>
just don't (can't!) know for sure because it has not been tried yet.<br>
And untill we do we'll never be sure. <br>
<p>
Hold it! is this *me* arguing *for* trying Libertarianism?<br>
<p>
Well maybe, I'm curious to... It would solve all the discussions.<br>
It would be intersting to see what happens, only will there be an emergency<br>
brake? What if there's something we missed? <br>
Karl Marx missed a few things...<br>
<p>
I'm Extropian, I like experiments...<br>
But it's like when you switch on a new Robot, you'll want a kill-switch<br>
handy just in case there's a bug in your coding, the kind of bugs that you<br>
don't notice untill you run the entire program.<br>
<p>
There was a bug like that in communism... it killed 100,000,000 humans<br>
(conservative estimate). Please de-bug before running!<br>
<p>
I hope someone with more knowledge of economics than myself can point out<br>
any flaws in the documents, I feel something itching but I can't put my<br>
finger on it.<br>
<p>
Thanx Dan, for clarifying a very complicated discussion.<br>
Regards,<br>
Arjen<br>
