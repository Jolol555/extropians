<i>&gt;  &gt; By "random" you seem to mean "diverse," sort of.  Surely the ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; and experiences we are exposed to are more systematic than pure noise.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  "Random" might have been a non-optimal word to describe what I meant.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  You are of course right in that our experiences are not random</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (otherwise we would not be able to learn anything; and if they were</i><br>
<i>&gt;  completely ordered we would quickly learn the rules and never have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  learn after childhood); but most of the experiences we learn from</i><br>
<i>&gt;  have not been planned as learning experiences, and might not even be</i><br>
<i>&gt;  good learning experiences (making a simple mistake when driving can</i><br>
<i>&gt;  be fatal).  Hence the interest in better ways of growth. A better</i><br>
<i>&gt;  word may be "unplanned" experiences. </i><br>
<p>
I have a real problem with this idea.  The keywords to my problem are<br>
"rules", "good", "bad" and "unplanned".  Who sets the 'rules', who decides<br>
which expirences are 'good' or 'bad'?  (and who's ganna make their cute<br>
little jackboots)  If we plan experiences to develop children to fit into our<br>
ideals how will they ever evolve, innovate or rebel.  Imagine if 50 years ago<br>
someone had the same idea and planned your life so that you would develop the<br>
ideology of the time (a good little christian boy); what makes you think we<br>
know any better?  Some animals are born with the ability to walk, we learn it<br>
from trial and error.. there's a reason for that.  The less you are<br>
programmed (which is what 'planned experience' amounts to) the more adaptive,<br>
innovative and creative you are.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Schools may be good or bad in different respects (and not all of them</i><br>
<i>&gt;  are Prussian either, although new forms of learning are needed) but</i><br>
<i>&gt;  they certainly help us learn a lot of things that would be very</i><br>
<i>&gt;  costly to learn on our own (like reading or writing or basic</i><br>
<i>&gt;  physics). A good education can teach us things we would have needed</i><br>
<i>&gt;  decades to learn on our own. The problem is that (by definition) they</i><br>
<i>&gt;  are best at transmitting academic knowledge and not other important</i><br>
<i>&gt;  aspects of human growth.</i><br>
<p>
How long does it take a child to 'pick up' language from listening to its<br>
parents?  and how long does it take to teach a child a language at school?  <br>
<p>
The difference between learning to speak and learning basic physics is that<br>
speaking is all around us, it is tacit learning.  Physics, despite being all<br>
around us, is not as obvious for children to simply 'pick up'.  The way to<br>
accelerate learning is to put this information all around students and let<br>
them take it in tacitly.  The toy of the future could be a holographic<br>
projecting nano-assembler.  To a little kid it looks like a bunch of brightly<br>
coloured balls that do weird thing when pushed together.  But the information<br>
learned from using it (what structures are strong, which ones calapse, etc.)<br>
will stay with them for the rest of their lives, not as something they<br>
learned at school, or something they had programmed into them, but as<br>
something obvious and easy, like the ability to speak.<br>
