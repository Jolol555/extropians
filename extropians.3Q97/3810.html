Yes, let's do it! I was hoping someone at extropy.org could<br>
set up an alias for us to use as our team email address, but<br>
I guess no one is interested in the possibility of winning $1k<br>
+ free publicity. Or maybe they just didn't read my message<br>
because of the excessively annoying mime format it was in. :-)<br>
I guess let's just use the email address "rc5@posthuman.com"<br>
since I have all email for that domain routed to me. I have<br>
2 P100s and at least one Pentium II 266 to throw at it...<br>
Notice on their client, you can download up to 200 blocks at a<br>
time if you want to process them offline.<br>
