<i>&gt; Yes, some fiat tender is backed by real property. But loans in general</i><br>
<i>&gt; need not be granted based upon bank assets. This is why you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; *negotiate* with a bank for a mortgage and recieve a credit card. </i><br>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; But, as banks loan more and more money (to buyers, investors,</i><br>
<i>&gt; entrepreneurs, etc.) the supply of disposable dollars increases. What</i><br>
<i>&gt; does this do? It lowers the value of a dollar -- or more simply, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; causes inflation of prices. Where at one point 1 dollar could buy 1</i><br>
<i>&gt; widget, inflation makes 1 widget cost $1.05 (or whatever). </i><br>
<p>
For loans which are backed by real property, the growth in the<br>
money supply roughly matches the growth in the value of all property.<br>
(The total value of property continually grows due to increased population<br>
and productivity.  People are constantly building new and better things.)<br>
This does not lead to inflation because the two grow roughly in step.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So, my point is, after that annoying review of U.S. econ (which was more</i><br>
<i>&gt; for my own amusement than anyone else's), money is created by way of</i><br>
<i>&gt; bank loans. The process of "creating" money is in no way dependent on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "standard." Given real property, gold, or comic books, a bank needs</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing to create money out of thin air (except a charter from the Fed,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or something like that). Interestingly, this is why a bank can offer you</i><br>
<i>&gt; a credit card. True, this is type II money, but it is still money. A</i><br>
<i>&gt; credit card offers people dollars at a very high price, and may have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been a partial cause of inflation within the past two decades. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The short of it is, I'm missing your point about the sum of mortgages</i><br>
<i>&gt; being approximately equal to the money supply. </i><br>
<p>
I believe that the amount of money loaned which is backed by real<br>
property, mostly mortgages, is much larger than the amount loaned<br>
unsecured, like credit cards.  When I looked this up a few years ago, it<br>
was true.  And it is unsurprising; most people live in housing worth<br>
much more than the value of their credit cards.  (Not many people could<br>
buy their house with their credit cards.)<br>
<p>
Furthermore, as I have said, the total amount of mortgages was<br>
approximately equal to the total money supply.  I'm sorry, I don't have<br>
the figures on hand now so I can't be more precise.  This was based on<br>
information in the Statistical Abstract of the U.S.  If you really need<br>
it I can spend a few hours and get you more accurate figures.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I disagree. The most important thing to a currency is how easily it can</i><br>
<i>&gt; be counterfeited. Wood chips carved with a big "C" for currency will</i><br>
<i>&gt; never be money. Wood is too common, and a currency based upon it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; prone to easy counterfeit. This is why transmutation was such an</i><br>
<i>&gt; intriguing thing. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to take a lump of lead</i><br>
<i>&gt; and turn it into gold? Not because I like gold at all, but because it</i><br>
<i>&gt; cannot be counterfeited -- gold is gold is gold. When Archimedes figured</i><br>
<i>&gt; out how to determine how much gold composes a certain alloy ("Eureka!")</i><br>
<i>&gt; he changed the world forever. (Okay, for a good long time at least.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Gold has a specific mass per volume. Mix in other metals and this mass</i><br>
<i>&gt; per volume changes. The short of it is that gold turned out to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficult to counterfeit. Even with nanotech one cannot counterfeit gold</i><br>
<i>&gt; (picotech?).</i><br>
<p>
This is a good point, but inability to counterfeit will not be enough.<br>
There has to be some value.  Otherwise, what will determine how much the<br>
currency is worth relative to other currencies?  Simple rarity?  We can<br>
see that is not the case.  There are many rare and unreproducible things<br>
which have low value, works of bad art for example.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My point is that no item will become currency unless it is difficult to</i><br>
<i>&gt; replicate. Who cares if it has value or not? As long as it can represent</i><br>
<i>&gt; value, that's all that matters. I don't see what the hubbub is over</i><br>
<i>&gt; money.          </i><br>
<p>
So does that mean I can give you some rarity, no matter how unpleasant,<br>
in payment for a debt I owe you, and as long as it cannot be replicated<br>
you will accept it?  If the item is so rare that, say, only 100 of them<br>
ever exist, can I claim that it is therefore worth 1/100 of the total<br>
amount of property in the world?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Clearly, allowing local scrips is inflationary. Or, at the very least,</i><br>
<i>&gt; creates money where money would not have been. This is of course very,</i><br>
<i>&gt; very bad for central fiscal policy. No matter what the Fed does to</i><br>
<i>&gt; reduce inflation, anyone with poker chips (or the capacity to make poker</i><br>
<i>&gt; chips) may add to the money supply at will.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; In short, I'm not surprised they hate new currencies.</i><br>
<p>
Actually there are reasons to expect competing currencies to be much<br>
*less* inflationary than monopoly currencies.  An inflating currency<br>
becomes unpopular and people shift to the competition.  That's why<br>
countries in the grip of hyper inflation try to prevent people from<br>
using other currencies, and a black market in strong currencies develops.<br>
<p>
So you're right that the Fed would not want this, since it loses the<br>
ability to inflate at will.  Still, the decision should be made not on<br>
the basis of what is good for the Fed, but of what is good for the<br>
citizenry.  As understanding of this relationship spreads, pressure may<br>
grow to allow some experiments along these lines.<br>
<p>
Alternatively, the growth of the net may facilitate "international<br>
trade" on a small scale, people living in one country, telecommuting to<br>
a company in another, and getting paid in the currency of a third.<br>
This could allow currency competition to develop on a wider scale.<br>
