<i> &gt; Yes, but these people were/are hardly Extropians, were/are they,</i><br>

<p>
Dude, I do not surrender my self-ownership to others,<br>
*regardless* of whether they happen to share my "ideals". Now<br>
I'm cringeing thinking about all the media-damage you are<br>
unthinkingly doing with this bull-in-a-china-shop style of<br>
posting. Don't you see that implicit in your remark is the idea<br>
that a world dictatorship would be okay if only an extropian<br>
were in charge? That's self-contradictory thinking, as far as<br>
I'm concerned. If you're into global dictatorship, you're no<br>
extropian, IMHO. End of story.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; If, for example, Hitler would have forced 6 million Jews to go into</i><br>
<i> &gt; cryonic suspension after their *natural* death, could you still</i><br>
<i> &gt; call him *morally* a criminal? </i><br>
<p>
Yes, he would still be a moral criminal for violating their<br>
self-ownership. <br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Is saving a person that's drowning</i><br>
<i> &gt; [in a sea of ignorance and denial] a bad thing?</i><br>
<p>
Saving a suicide against eir will may not be a flat-out bad thing,<br>
but I submit that it is, at the very least, morally ambiguous. If<br>
objective judgements of sanity and insanity were possible in every<br>
case (they are not), then it might be a good thing to rescue insane<br>
suicidal people, but it would be a bad thing to rescue sane suicidal<br>
people. I do believe that there are certain people (irreparable<br>
psychologically damaged people, for instance, who present a grave<br>
and uncontrollable danger to others) for whom the sane thing to do<br>
might properly be suicide. But the real point here is that a<br>
conscious mental life is owned by that mind itself, not another.<br>
And where I come from, self-ownership necessarily includes the<br>
power to destroy oneself. Sometimes ones long-term strategic goals<br>
can include short-term tactical weirdness. Whether you understand<br>
this or not is beside the point: that some people have understandings<br>
of the world that are currently inaccessible to others is exactly<br>
why the principle of self-ownership is so vitally important.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Doesn't superior knowledge almost automatically put one in charge</i><br>
<i> &gt; [or do you have to "play stupid" to save the other's ego's instead</i><br>
<i> &gt; of their lives]?</i><br>
<p>
Sure, but people claiming superior knowledge coming in with arms<br>
(the means of *proving* their superior knowledge to me) to save me<br>
from myself are unlikely to meet with much cooperation from me.<br>
Unless you consider a halo flaming lead "cooperative".<br>
<p>
You are talking war-talk, den Otter, whether you realize it or<br>
not. Those who talk war-talk get war-responses. I don't care for<br>
real physical war myself (I prefer argumentation).<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; they will surely perish. Now this may be fine in the case of  the</i><br>
<i> &gt; anonymous masses, but not with friends and relatives. If they</i><br>
<i> &gt; can't/won't understand the life-bringing logic behind the transhuman</i><br>
<i> &gt; concept, they must be deemed mentally disturbed, and [thus]</i><br>
<i> &gt; incompetend to decide for themselves (ok, ok this sounds so arrogant</i><br>
<i> &gt; it will knock yer socks off, but that's the way it is).</i><br>
<p>
So let me get this straight: you're planning to hold a gun to<br>
your Uncle Ernie's head and *force* him to upload, whether he<br>
likes it or not? To save him from his own bad memes? I think you<br>
might want to inspect your nervous system and make sure you<br>
don't have any weird viral junk lurking there yourself before<br>
you go holding guns to people's heads.<br>
<p>
Seriously: how clean is your system? Have you done a deep<br>
neural-scan lately? Are you willing to claim what few people are<br>
willing to claim: that you have examined all the information<br>
lurking in your soul (you know, that big chordate nervous<br>
assemblage) and all the crufty legacy code all hooked together<br>
in there, weird hormonal things left over from therapsids and<br>
fish and monkeys, and you know that It's All Good?  Because<br>
that's the presumption that you're pinning your whole argument<br>
on.<br>
<p>
Don't *make* me get Lovecraftian on your ass, now.   ;)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; The only reason there is *not* to cryonically suspend [or otherwise</i><br>
<i> &gt; save] a reluctant person, is when you *don't really care*. Period.</i><br>
<p>
I'm sorry, but I see no conflict between deeply caring about<br>
someone and deeply respecting eir self-ownership and eir ability<br>
to control eir own life. In fact, demonstrated ability to take<br>
responsibility for one's own life is one of the things that<br>
elicits caring from me, when I recognize that in other people.<br>
Inability to respect the self-ownership of other human beings,<br>
such as you are demonstrating, is one of the few things that<br>
tends to elicit genuine enmity in me. I'm not there yet, I just<br>
thought I'd let you know that you are treading on ground that I<br>
take very seriously.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; If you think that passively killing people you like/love is better</i><br>
<i> &gt; than to "limit" their "freedom" [of decay] for awhile when they're</i><br>
<i> &gt; dead anyway, so they too have the chance to live a full life in a</i><br>
<i> &gt; marvellous future, you should really check your values (IMHO).</i><br>
<p>
You are talking as if you have an ownership interst in the lives<br>
of other human beings. You may have an interest, but it's not an<br>
ownership interest.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Most things, [including the limitation of people's freedom] are</i><br>
<i> &gt; neutral in themselves, the context the're [used] in decides whether</i><br>
<i> &gt; they are "good" or "bad".</i><br>
<p>
You're right, den Otter. I'd better assemble a tactical<br>
squadron, find out where you live, kidnap you, and set up a<br>
brainwashing operation to save you from your own bad memes.<br>
