<p>
I think in the post that you were replying to, I was trying to<br>
broadcast disapproval, so I wasn't particularly concerning<br>
myself with predictive power.  As Alan Kay said, the best way<br>
to predict the future is to create it.  If it weren't for that<br>
sort of idea, there would be no interesting reasons for<br>
pacifism.<br>
<p>
It's hard to do both exhortation and explanation well simultaneously,<br>
and it's interesting that I phrased my exhortation so badly that<br>
you read it as an explanation.  Maybe I was being sneaky on some<br>
level I wasn't aware of at the time.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Try desires for power, fame, pleasing Allah combined with </i><br>
<i> &gt; indifference towards a long life expectancy (for example, some </i><br>
<i> &gt; Olympic athletes reportedly say they would take a drug that </i><br>
<i> &gt; promised them victory even if they expected it to kill them soon </i><br>
<i> &gt; after).</i><br>
<p>
I can imagine these things, and I can imagine desiring them,<br>
but I'm not boddhisattva enough to be able to avoid<br>
disapproving of those who desire them enough to want to start<br>
wars over them.  Perhaps if I were less materialistic, I could<br>
get along well with warmongers and the ideals over which they<br>
fight.<br>
<p>
You did put an interesting thought in my head though: an<br>
orthodox Tiplerite jihad, being fought over whether or not<br>
big-endian or little-endian computers tended most to the<br>
greater glory of Infinite Computation.  It would be very funny<br>
if it weren't so scary.<br>
