In a message dated 97-07-08 11:06:36 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I think reproduction would expand to fill all available areas as soon as<br>
 possible.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Whence the Fermi Paradox?<br>
<p>
Doesn't (mumble mumble)'s Law indicate that there has already been time<br>
enough for the entire galaxy to have been colonized?<br>
<p>
I would point out two possibly pertinent points.<br>
<p>
As the level of affluence goes up....the birthrate goes down....<br>
<p>
The only reason that the U.S.'s population is going up is immigration....the<br>
"natives" are below ZPG. As is true in other industrialized nations.<br>
<p>
REALLY HIGH Tech.  (Nanotechnology, Uploading and consequently Very Virtual<br>
Reality) <br>
Suppose  that when a society reaches a certain level it IMPLODES.   Expanding<br>
into Cyberspace at many hundred multiples of lightspeed....but that  that<br>
cyberspace is expanding only at the speed that the society's nanotech is<br>
converting all ambiet matter into computational machinery...<br>
