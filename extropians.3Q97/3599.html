Heavier black holes have gentler tidal effects, so you will<br>
survive a bit longer. As for the relative motion, I don't<br>
think it will change much unless you or the hole are strongly<br>
relativistic. Oh, yes, to bring up a current thread on<br>
rec.arts.sf.science, if you fall towards the hole along<br>
a non-radial orbit you will likely experience strong torques <br>
too, so if you miss the hole the resulting spin might kill you.<br>
<p>
Kids, remember that playing near black holes can be dangerous!<br>
Always ask you parents for permission first. <br>

<i>&gt; What if a particle, say a neutron, that was moving very fast -so</i><br>
<i>&gt; close to the speed of light that it's mass was equal to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; earth's mass -were to hit the earth dead center?  Would the</i><br>
<i>&gt; particle just pass on through?  Or would it hit other particles,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which in turn would hit more (other) particles, to such an extent</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the earth would be destroyed?  Would there be an "entry</i><br>
<i>&gt; wound" and an "exit wound?"</i><br>
<p>
I think it would depend a lot on the particle, some particles<br>
interact weakly with matter (like neutrinos) while others<br>
interact strongly (like alpha particles). A neutrino would<br>
likely just sweep through with no effects, while the alpha<br>
particle would likely crash. In the crash some of its<br>
kinetic energy will be transferred to other particles, creating<br>
a cascade. If its relativistic mass was equal to the mass<br>
of the earth, then I think it is quite safe to assume that<br>
there will be no exit wound - there will be no planet,<br>
and likely no moon, left...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  What if the particle were moving so</i><br>
<i>&gt; fast that its mass were 1 solar mass?  5 solar masses?</i><br>
<p>
We are getting up in the gammar-ray burster class here. The sun converts<br>
around one ton of mass into energy every second (I think, can somebody <br>
corraborate this?); converting one earth mass into energy would likely<br>
be in the supernova range. Converting stellar masses into energy would<br>
be visible across the universe, and really mess up things nearby. <br>
<p>
Just to get an impression of the power we are talking about, take<br>
a look at <a href="http://spacsun.rice.edu/~twg/pc500.html">http://spacsun.rice.edu/~twg/pc500.html</a>, which shows<br>
some of the local interstellar medium. Those 100-lightyear bubbles<br>
are likely due to ordinary supernovas... <br>
