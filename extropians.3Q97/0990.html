To interested List-Members:<br>
<p>
Besides developments in intelligent filtering and content rating systems <br>
for S/N ratio, has anyone though of simply creating separate lists for <br>
gradiations of S/N?<br>
<p>
An example would be:<br>
<p>
<p>
Level 1: Very High S/N<br>
<p>
     On this list only the most critical and well-thought out posts <br>
would be allowed via a moderator.  These posts would be in the form of <br>
Journal Articles/Peer Review.  Sort of an online Extropy Journal.  <br>
Reviews and responses would have to go through a moderator or be posted <br>
on levels 2 or 3.<br>
<p>
Level 2: Moderate S/N<br>
<p>
     This list would consist of posts with the expectation that that <br>
they be of a critical and well reasoned nature.  In many ways, this <br>
would resemble the list in its current form.  If peoples posts start to <br>
get too fuzzy, then point them out as you see fit.  If they show an <br>
honest attempt to increase the S/N of their responses, they should be <br>
encouraged.  This list would give others of a more fuzzy-headed nature <br>
to improve their critical thinking skills amidst other highly <br>
intelligent subscribers.<br>
    <br>
    {One of the things I enjoy about the current Extro-List is the <br>
opportunity to meet *PEOPLE* who share like-minded goals.  Sometimes its <br>
nice just to be able to chat with other kindred spirits in an open and <br>
inviting arena. So we should have a level 3.}<br>
<p>
Level 3:<br>
<p>
Any and all who consider themselves extropic would be encouraged to <br>
makes posts on this list so that we can all get better acquainted.  This <br>
is would be a place for people to make connections.   Consider this list <br>
an ongoing 24/7 extro party.  People who hang out too much on lists 1 <br>
and 2 should be encouraged to take their shirt off once and awhile, <br>
lighten up and party.  <br>
<p>
<p>
*Keep in mind these are only examples I made up as I went along.  It <br>
comes from the earnest desire to see all of the people on this list get <br>
the best of all possible worlds - and perhaps start getting along with <br>
each other.<br>
<p>
<p>
Warm Regards,<br>
<p>
Bobby Whalen<br>
<p>
<p>
P.S. People who spend too much time on list 3, should be encouraged to <br>
subscribe and listen in on the more serious discussions of lists 1 &amp; 2 - <br>
maybe they will learn something.<br>
