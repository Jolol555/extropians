But even if that's true, the last comparitive reliability figures I saw<br>
showed that it typically crashes three times as often so you notice it<br>
more. In comparison I don't really care how long Linux takes to start up <br>
(though it feels faster than Win95 and *is* faster than NT) because I can <br>
happily go for coffee on the few occasions when it's neccesary; my workstation <br>
had been up for nearly three months as a development machine and web-server <br>
before someone accidentally unplugged the power lead last week. Goes to show <br>
that there's nothing inherently unreliable about PC hardware.<br>

<p>
Actually from what I've heard the workers at EuroDisney have a typically<br>
obnoxious French attitude, which is why most British folks still prefer to<br>
go to Florida instead. Anyway, until recently going to Disney World was<br>
cheaper.<br>

P.S. I'm typing this on an "absolute crap" 486/66 with 8 MB of RAM,<br>
which makes a fine Linux Web development platform if I'm not connected <br>
to the Net by modem and don't use SSL (both of which are inherently<br>
too CPU-intensive to run at the same time as Netscape and the rest of<br>
the web server).<br>
