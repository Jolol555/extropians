   Yes - that is correct.  I last laid eyes on it over 7 years ago. <br>
As I recall he was definitely trying to *extend* the life of the sun<br>
by converting it into a white dwarf.  His hope was to *sustain* a<br>
10E15+ population solar civilization over trillions of years.  <br>
	I find this whole concept interesting - as extropians do we emphasize<br>
intelligence increase (your method), longevity (Criswells/Beech’s<br>
method) or a delicate balance of both?<br>
