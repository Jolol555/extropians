<i>&gt;&gt; I think your guys are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; thinking too far ahead. Any civilizations first interstellar missions</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; will not be that much different from our existing space program,</i><br>
 <br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I completely disagree.  Statistically, the chances that the aliens just</i><br>
<i>&gt;happen to be within 100 years of our own technological development is so</i><br>
<i>&gt;low as to be absurd.  100 years is less than one ten thousandth of one</i><br>
<i>&gt;percent of the age of the Earth.  Imagine two planets which happened</i><br>
<i>&gt;to create intelligent life which flowered at exactly the same time,</i><br>
<i>&gt;to this level of precision.  Impossible!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You don't seem to appreciate the power which we're going to be able</i><br>
<i>&gt;to wield in 100 years.  Ever hear of the "singularity"?  Ever hear of</i><br>
<i>&gt;"nanotech"?  Ever hear of AIs billions of times more intelligent than</i><br>
<i>&gt;the smartest humans today?  In 100 years *we* (meaning our cultural</i><br>
<i>&gt;descendants) should be able to launch the interstellar expedition</i><br>
<i>&gt;described above.</i><br>
<p>
Both sides here are assuming facts not in evidence. Both *could* be right.<br>
*I* know I have no way of telling besides living through whatever I live <br>
through. I think there's a good chance we may auger in on what I<br>
sometimes call "the nano-Beirut scenario".<br>
<p>
Someone else mentioned the destabilizing effects of, e.g., handing over<br>
backyard atom tech to "anyone"--me, I have a little more faith in people<br>
than to believe they'd nuke school rather than just cut classes...<br>
<p>
But there is little question in my mind that unless things collapse, <br>
individuals will have control of the equivalent energy stored in <br>
weapons of mass destruction--this is an easy prediction because <br>
individuals have already had such control; I mean "more individuals".<br>
<p>
My ongoing question is how to make a world like that stay one I <br>
wouldn't mind coming back to.<br>
<p>
A great danger is that this, or greater (say, strong nt), power will<br>
continue to concentrate in the hands of the few.<br>
<p>
This seems to imply that humans have to grow up or grow out or both.<br>
I don't see clearly how things will go, but I'm pretty sure pluralism<br>
won't be a bed of roses.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is the biggest problem I have with UFO stories.  The aliens are</i><br>
<i>&gt;laughable caricatures, Buck Rogers in a flying saucer.  They're just</i><br>
<i>&gt;like we would have been back in the 1940's if we had that era's idea</i><br>
<i>&gt;of future technology.</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;The limited abilities of the aliens are due to the limited imaginations</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the people reporting them, nothing more.  It's just as dated as Star</i><br>
<i>&gt;Trek.</i><br>
<p>
That's why I like the Vallee scenario(s) from _Messengers of Deception_.<br>
It's amusing to contemplate a natural, Earthly phenomenon that hits<br>
people in such a way that they later explain the occurrence in a semi-<br>
archetypical fashion: angels long ago, strange airship operators in the <br>
last century, BEMs now; all speaking and acting cryptically and "cosmically".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We've got a lot of new people on the list, and they don't seem to have</i><br>
<i>&gt;fully internalized the new way of thinking about the future.  Read some</i><br>
<i>&gt;of Moravec's stuff.  His new book has excerpts on the web at</i><br>
<i>&gt;&lt;URL: <a href="http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/book97/book97.index.html">http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/book97/book97.index.html</a> &gt;.  Read</i><br>
<i>&gt;the other references which have been discussed here recently.  It is</i><br>
<i>&gt;gradually becoming clear that the future is not going to be what we thought</i><br>
<i>&gt;back in the 1960's.  It's going to be awesome, strange and terrible (in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the older sense of the word).  It's going to be great and godlike.  Any</i><br>
<i>&gt;superlative you like can apply.</i><br>
<p>
It's going to be extremely rough sledding, at least for a while.<br>
It _may_ get better after that. Then again, maybe not. How's that<br>
for a specific prediction? :)<br>
