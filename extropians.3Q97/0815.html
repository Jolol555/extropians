But what makes that funny? <br>
<p>
If there was no person involved, how absurd would it be? The notion of<br>
skiing isn't very absurd. The notion of shooting isn't very absurd. But<br>
put a person in the situation of skiing and then shooting, skiing and<br>
then shooting, it becomes a bit absurd. Take it then to another level<br>
where a person is running, and then fishing, that becomes really absurd<br>
-- according to certain criteria. I would say that without the person,<br>
it isn't absurd at all. <br>
<p>
I think EvMick was suggesting that a situation recounted at someone's<br>
expense -- whether explicitly or otherwise -- is the essence of what a<br>
joke is. <br>
<p>
I think I agree.<br>
