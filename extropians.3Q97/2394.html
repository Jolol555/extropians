<p>
	well, i wouldn't go so far as to say that many adults are<br>
	"reasonably civilised and rational".<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; If any of them don't come back, well, that's just "evolution in action". </i><br>
<p>
	yep...<br>
<p>
	the question here is : do we accept the old systems because they<br>
	have done some good, even though they are critically flawed?<br>
	let's say i was raised a christian.  i am now pretty much agnostic<br>
	... i try to reserve judgement when it comes to spooks, phantasmal<br>
	spectres, virgin mothers, all those things that can neither be<br>
	proven or disproven.  should i raise my children to be Christians<br>
	because of a few good things (don't kill people, don't steal<br>
	things, treat one another as you would want to be treated,  etc.<br>
	etc.), ignoring the the thousands of years of wars, rape, and<br>
	strife caused directly or indirectly by christianity?  should<br>
	i raise them as christians just because that's how it's always<br>
	been done in my family?<br>
<p>
	or, for that matter, let's say that i was homosexual and i end<br>
	up with a child through some means.  i want to raise this child.<br>
	should i ditch my life partner and marry a member of the opposite<br>
	sex because "that's how it's always been done"?  <br>
<p>
	or, back to home schooling.<br>
<p>
	i'm not advocating that everybody withdraw their child from school<br>
	tomorrow ... i know any number of parents that would do a TERRIBLE<br>
	job at educating their children ... but that doesn't mean that you<br>
	stick up for public schools.<br>
<p>
	it's the whole damn system that has to be dismantled.  and<br>
	it's happening ... that's why the vestiges of the old (industrial)<br>
	age are crumbling.  the educational system just can't keep up.<br>
	soon it will all be replaced by something that will actually work<br>
	-- for now. <br>
