<i>&gt; Let's be very careful here--Richter said nothing about discarding </i><br>
<i>&gt; philsophy in general and focused entirely on ideology.  Philosphy is a </i><br>
<i>&gt; mental discipline that encourages questioning and rigorous </i><br>
<i>&gt; examination;  ideology discourages critical thinking and relies on </i><br>
<i>&gt; emotions such as fear and insecurity, and as such it is used as a </i><br>
<i>&gt; tool by those who would control others.  Richter had first-hand </i><br>
<i>&gt; experirence in his own life of how ideology is used to control and </i><br>
<i>&gt; imprison other humans, and I greatly admire him for standing up </i><br>
<i>&gt; against it.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, please.  That's not being careful, that's redifining what the man<br>
said into meanings less controversial--evading the issue, not dealing<br>
with it.  Let's not pretend that the enemies of "ideology" don't mean<br>
what they say; they do, and should be held accountable for their<br>
beliefs.  Those who use the term "ideologue" as derogatory--and there<br>
are many--do not oppose only those ideologies imposed by fear or used<br>
to control others.  They hold equal disdain for reasoned ideologies<br>
and ideologies opposed to control.  I have been called an ideologue<br>
in the dergoatory sense more than once for being a free-speech<br>
absolutist, for example.<br>
