Someone, I think it was Forrest, mentioned changes to the law as of this<br>
year. He was right. Not only do these laws represent removal of existing<br>
barriers (if any ever did exist) but I would say that they qualify as<br>
"pump-priming" as well (of special note in this view are secs. 5803,<br>
5807, and 5808).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;From 15 USCS Sec. 5801-5803; 5807-5808 (1997):</i><br>

vital cornerstone of the United States space program;<br>
