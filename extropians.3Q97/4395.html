You have a very good point there. I think this is something--that the<br>
analysis mentioned by someone on this thread recently *does* miss that<br>
point--and I'll try to communicate that to the essayist.<br>
<p>
Then again, doing research on Pluto might be considered to be roughly<br>
equivalent to doing stuff at the North Pole. Hardly a walk in the park, at<br>
least in the terms Heinlein wrote of the Pluto of his day (cf. _Have<br>
Spacesuit, Will Travel_: cold, dark, Spartan, *cold*). <br>
<p>
Also, though this is weak, it is worth considering that the job might<br>
be crummy enough compared to working in industry (pay) or academia<br>
(secret; no publishing == "perishing") that it is indeed hardship for<br>
those reasons too. Consider NSA mathematicians. <br>
<p>
As for physical hardship: living on/around Pluto for a two-year tour of<br>
duty could be a real drag.<br>
<p>
Now it may well be that with all the in-space experience we've logged that<br>
seems to show that *overheating* in your suit is more of a problem than<br>
*freexing to death*, *possibly* things on Pluto are not as dire as<br>
he painted them; Venus is short on swamps and sapient amphibian life, too.<br>
<p>
But you're still breathing your own socks, with no Sun (just a bright <br>
spark in the eternal night sky), no parks, no pets (probably), and no or<br>
few vacations. I'd guess that Heinlein envisioned it as akin to living in<br>
a nuclear sub--that takes a special kind of person.<br>
<p>
But as I say, you have made a strong point, directly related to the<br>
text, which makes it better than Heinlein's "...veteran firefighter or<br>
veteran schoolteacher..."<br>
<p>
Thank you.<br>
