Regarding Damien Broderick's "The Spike"...<br>
<p>
So!  The news is out, eh?  I still can't find it at Amazon.com... so if<br>
anybody finds out how to get Spiked in the U.S., let me know.  I've got<br>
requests for half a dozen copies.<br>
<p>
Take note, ye who post to Our Most Extropian List:  Many trenchant yet blunt<br>
comments about us appear in a footnote on page 261 - and are not listed under<br>
our names in the index!<br>
<p>
<p>
Regarding the book itself:<br>
<p>
Sure, it's a fine book.  Novelty, bright hints of strangeness, casually<br>
dropped gems of information...  A fine book.  Wrong, of course.  "Wrong, but<br>
interesting and informative" is all you can hope for when discussing any<br>
future, much less the Spike.<br>
<p>
The book had quite a few highlights; completely new pieces of information that<br>
delighted and surprised me.  The Alpha Point... pixels in the Utility Fog...<br>
Moravec's description of Exes... and the fine distinction between<br>
Transcension, Inflexion Point, and Event Horizon, which I liked very much.  I,<br>
for one, am an unabashed student and advocate of Transcension.<br>
<p>
<p>
There are a *few* disputes I have with the book.  Note that I'd dispute "The<br>
Spike" if a Vingean Power had written it.  What can I say?  Finding flaws in<br>
anything is part of who I am.  Besides, since the Singularity presents an<br>
alternative, we don't need to pretend that life, or anything in it, is perfect.<br>
<p>
Dispute the first:  After reading my section, I stopped and spent a frantic<br>
day writing "The Ethics Of Cognitive Engineering"(*).  Broderick wasn't overly<br>
fond of - i.e., he was horrified by - my suggestion to tinker with the brains<br>
of children.  Said so in writing, too.  So I think I probably did manage to<br>
genuinely shock a few readers.<br>
(* = <a href="http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/algernon_ethics.html">http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/algernon_ethics.html</a>)<br>
<p>
And then too, I'd have been happier if there'd been room for all my technical<br>
paragraphs... instead of just the dramatic conclusions.  Suddenly I understand<br>
certain stylistic anomalies in books such as "Engines of Creation".  The<br>
authors will carefully explain a new technology, and then - just as they reach<br>
the dramatic conclusion - start repeating themselves.<br>
<p>
Well, it's not pedantry... it's not lack of imagination... it's not<br>
fanaticism... it's not bad editing.  What they knew - that I didn't, alas -<br>
was that the dramatic conclusions are what will be quoted out of context. <br>
Therefore, every dramatic conclusion must contain, in summary, all the<br>
reasoning that leads up to it.  You have to write for your readers' readers,<br>
not just your readers.<br>
<p>
Personally, I'm not sure I could stand to write like that.  Well, it's the<br>
most "controversial" people - read "loony" - who get all the media attention. <br>
So perhaps it's all for the best; why shouldn't one articulate person get in<br>
by mistake?  Besides, this is a hypertext world.  If I want to write<br>
summarized dramatic conclusions, I can write a distinct "Quotable Version" and<br>
link to that.<br>
<p>
Ah, well.  Hence the phrase:  "Help... I've been popularized."  On the whole,<br>
I came across as someone worth reading... and I can't expect Broderick to say<br>
in 6 pages what I said in 40.  And it's nice to be referenced; it makes you<br>
feel more solid, as if your existence is stabilized within the interpersonal<br>
network of the world.<br>
<p>
<p>
Dispute the second and stylistic:  Broderick doesn't harp on hubris the way Ed<br>
Regis does, but his occasional courtesies to his predecessor still get on the<br>
nerves.  It's even worse because I know perfectly well that Broderick isn't<br>
shocked by any of this; he's been on this list long enough to lose it. <br>
Delight in the new, or occasional horror, yes.  But shock?  You can't make me<br>
believe it.  Broderick isn't a technophobe, and I'd wish he'd stop trying to<br>
pretend he was.<br>
<p>
And Broderick is writing about the Singularity, not high technology.  For the<br>
Singularity, hubris isn't the appropriate emotion.  One feels faced with some<br>
great tidal wave of change, vast, tall, overwhelming, strange, rushing at us<br>
inexorably whether we say yea or nay...  As Vinge put it, "Sometimes I think<br>
I'd feel more comfortable regarding the Singularity from a remove of a<br>
thousand years... instead of twenty."  Where Broderick conveys that, the book<br>
is good - but where he gets confused and thinks he's Ed Regis, well, I'd<br>
rather he hadn't.<br>
<p>
<p>
Dispute the third and futuristic:  Broderick is *still* trying to write about<br>
Life After Singularity in human terms.  I hate that.  It strikes me as such a<br>
huge waste of time.  It's not that we can't figure it out - though we can't -<br>
it's that, well, who *cares*?  Leave it to our future selves!  *We* should be<br>
figuring out how to get there.  In this sense, it could be said that I<br>
disagree with the premise of the whole book.  Everything Broderick discusses<br>
could be divided into two groups:  Things that, were I writing them, I would<br>
call "The Near Future"... and things that aren't really our concern.  Alas,<br>
you can't sneak up on the Singularity through "careful, detailed thinking<br>
about what it would really be like to be uploaded into a computer". <br>
[Paraphrase.]  You can fill the air with guesses, striving always to make the<br>
guesses as *strange* as possible.  But of course you can't get it right.<br>
<p>
<p>
Finally, dispute the fourth:  I feel that Broderick is occasionally too<br>
judgemental... and at times, parts of the book show a definite bias towards<br>
what happens to be his own position.  So he's human.  I only worry because, as<br>
I was quoted, I came across as being a little socialist.  This is because one<br>
or two sentences from "Staring Into The Singularity", the ones concerned with<br>
"social science", do sound socialist if divorced from the previous sentences<br>
explaining what exactly is wrong.  Call me loony, but Broderick seems to<br>
advocate taking a center road between socialism and capitalism, and I can't<br>
help but think the two are unrelated.  But the real me tries to think up<br>
streamlinked economies that are to capitalism what capitalism is to socialism.<br>
<p>
<p>
Summary:<br>
<p>
So does the book justify its existence?  Of course.  Don't mind me.  The above<br>
items are really minor flaws.  Broderick wasn't launching a project to design<br>
a Power; he was writing a book.  What you measure in Extropian books are their<br>
love of the new, their bright hints of strangeness, the casually dropped gems<br>
of information.  On that scale, Broderick did fine.  "Wrong, but interesting<br>
and informative" is all you can hope for when discussing any future, much less<br>
the Singularity and Spike.<br>
