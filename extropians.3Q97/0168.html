<i>&gt; How do you implement a "slap drone" for a Jupiter-eater? </i><br>
<i>&gt; For a galaxy-eater?</i><br>
I don't think there is a solution in these cases. If the sociopath is <br>
more powerful than the society, then the society just has to take it's <br>
chances.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Or for a suitably-subtle con man or atom rustler?</i><br>
If they are suitably subtle, noone knows a 'crime' has been commited, so <br>
noone cares anyway. Apart from the philosophers, of course. :-)<br>

<i>&gt; How do you implement banishment if the Diaspora has</i><br>
<i>&gt; already headed out at .99 c?</i><br>
This could be a problem. It depends on the balance between the <br>
acceleration and the reproduction. Until (or if) we approach the Omega <br>
point then there is no real reason (that I can see) to stop and use <br>
every atom (or solar system) we come across. If we find space is pretty <br>
self-similar, it might pay us to expand out towards 'intersting' areas <br>
(unusual pulsars etc) and ignore quite a proportion of intervening <br>
space, just leaving a few monitoring drones to 'stake our claim', if we <br>
want to. Much of America went unclaimed until the more economicaly <br>
active regions were filled out, and in an expotentially expanding sphere <br>
this may take a *long* time to happen. Of course, if 'we' choose to <br>
reproduce faster than we accelerate, there would be no niches left only <br>
a few points behind the leading edge.<br>
