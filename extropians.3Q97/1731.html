<p>
44 bits per proton. If the Beckenstein bound is true (probably is, but it has<br>
never been rigorously proved) then the amount of information inside a sphere <br>
of radius R that contains energy E is less than or equal to 2*PI*E*R/(h *ln2), <br>
h is really h bar. For meters (R) and kilograms (M) that works out to  <br>
2.577 *10^43* M*R bits. A proton has a radius of 10^-15 meters and a mass of<br>
1.67 *10^-27 kilograms, plug that in and you get 44 bits. You'd do a lot <br>
better with a Hydrogen atom. The mass is almost the same but it's a lot <br>
bigger, about 10^-10 meters, so a hydrogen atom can store 4*10^6 bits.<br>

If we have an omega point then countable infinity is all I can guarantee, but <br>
maybe by then we'll think of something.<br>

Mine too. The idea that you can tell if something is real by examining it's <br>
complexity, and the simpler the realer, is confusing. A perfect geometric  <br>
line is much simpler than the tree trunk of a pine tree, yet I think you <br>
would say the tree was more real. Why? The shape of the Mandelbrot Set is <br>
more complex than the shape of a grape, yet you say the grape is real and the <br>
set is not. Exactly what is the relationship between complexity and reality?<br>
