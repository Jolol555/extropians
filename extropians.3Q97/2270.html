<p>
It can also provide defensive capabilities to meet the destructive<br>
capabilities.  It's this balance that has kept us alive until now (internal<br>
nanowar is happening all the time) and it's this balance that will keep some<br>
of us (if not all) alive for a considerably longer time.<br>

<p>
If you make something illegal the only people who will have access to it are<br>
those who want to commit mass-destruction.  We need to leave it open to the<br>
masses so they can defend themselves from any maniac who wants to kill them.<br>
 If one in a million is such a maniac, then we can have a million people<br>
making sure their defence is more than capable of shielding them from that or<br>
any other maniac.<br>
<p>
Educating people about these things, rather than hiding them away so only the<br>
most determined nut can find them is our best chance of survival.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  It seems clear to me that this problem needs to be addressed. I've </i><br>
<i>&gt;  heard people defending "each one's right to his or her own nuke", but </i><br>
<i>&gt;  that principle seems to me absurd. (Since each nuke could kill more </i><br>
<i>&gt;  than a million people, and there probably are more than one </i><br>
<i>&gt;  per million who would use his nuke, it would kill all of us.)</i><br>
<p>
The alternative to "each one's right to his or her nuke" is giving a few<br>
people defensive/offensive abilities and taking them away from the rest.  If<br>
you don't have a problem with that, then I wish you the best of luck when<br>
your world governments leaders hide behind their active shields and you wish<br>
you had been allowed the knowledge to make your own!<br>
