As some of you have no doubt surmised...I have a bad attitude...I know I do<br>
because I've been told so since I was a wee tot....usually by an elder  or<br>
other "authority figuref" whom I was getting the better of in an argument (I<br>
thought of it as reasoned debate).<br>
<p>
Also no doubt noticed by some of the more astute members of this list is my<br>
bent toward anti-authorianism.  Hence one of my favorite questions over the<br>
years to proauthoritarian types is"<br>
<p>
"At what point is it morally and ethically correct for a group to do<br>
something which is morally and ethically incorrect for an individual?"  <br>
<p>
That is...presumably it is incorrect for individuals to steal...but if it is<br>
called taxation (by a group) then it is OK.<br>
<p>
Presumably it is incorrect for individuals to kill....but if it is called<br>
"execution" (by a group)..then it is OK.<br>
<p>
Presumably it is incorrect for individuals to extort, ....but susrely you get<br>
the point.  My question has always been what is the minimium group size?<br>
<p>
Isn't it written somewhere (Federalists Papers? Constitutional supporting<br>
documentation...some political speech by muckity-muck?) that the governments<br>
just rights are derived from it's citizenry?  Suppose the citizenry doesn't<br>
HAVE that right...then how can the coersive and oppressive state claim any<br>
moral justification toward exercising same?.....other than force that is.<br>
<p>
Another thing that I've often wondered.  Suppose a politician is making a<br>
speech saying things that I think are admirable and true...only the<br>
politician doesn't beleive what he is saying...he is only saying it to get my<br>
support....<br>
<p>
Is that politican lying?  Even though he is telling the truth... ?  Does<br>
beleif in what you are saying influence whether it's true or not...?<br>
<p>
At which point I was generally accused of having a "bad attitude"...which<br>
presumably won the argument in favor of authoritarianism.<br>
