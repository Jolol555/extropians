Regarding Damien Broderick's request:<br>
Below are some stories that treat the "travel" theme. Each has already<br>
been reprinted (multiple times in some cases) which may mean they are<br>
too well known. On the other hand, they each have the imprimatur<br>
of multiple editors.<br>
<p>
"Long Shot" by Vernor Vinge.  Analog 1972.  Reprinted in "War with the<br>
Robots" edited by Isaac Asimov, Patricia Warrick, Martin<br>
Greenberg. Also reprinted in "True Names and Other Dangers" by Vernor<br>
Vinge.<br>
<p>
"I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon" (also known as "Frozen Journey") by<br>
Phillip K. Dick. Reprinted in "The Norton Book of Science Fiction"<br>
edited by Ursula K. Le Guin and Brian Attebery. Also reprinted in "The<br>
Collected Stories of Phillip K. Dick. Volume 5" by Phillip K. Dick.<br>
<p>
"Semley's Necklace" by Ursula K. Le Guin.<br>
Reprinted in "Oxford Book of Science Fiction Stories" edited by Tom<br>
Shippey.<br>
<p>
"The Burning of the Brain" by Cordwainer Smith.<br>

<p>

<p>
"Walking the Moons" by Jonathan Lethem.<br>
Reprinted in "Year's Best Science Fiction Eighth Annual"<br>

and is not interstellar but might provide an interesting contrast.<br>
<p>
Good luck putting your collection together.<br>
