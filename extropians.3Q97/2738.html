Nanites haven't evolved to compete with anything. In fact,<br>
nanites don't exist yet. Neither does AI, which would be<br>
necessary in some form for these things to be serious threats.<br>
Extrapolating multiple interacting fundamental advances in<br>
several different fields of technology (e. g. nanotechnology<br>
*and* artificial intelligence) may be fun, but that doesn't<br>
mean we're going to be very good at it. <br>
<p>
It sounds as if you are attempting to make an a priori case for<br>
believing that "nanites" will outcompete (in biological terms!)<br>
biological organisms.  I don't think a priori methods are very<br>
useful in dealing with these kinds of things.  The best we could<br>
do right now, probably, is to open a claim on the Foresight Exchange,<br>
something like "Homo sapiens will be biologically extinct (no more<br>
phenotypes from unmodified Homo sap genomes) by 2050." and see what<br>
odds the market puts on that claim.  This claim would stimulate<br>
research into the areas you are concerned with, because for someone<br>
to speculate successfully on this claim, they'd have to research<br>
the particular issues you are raising.  But the person who registers<br>
the claim is going to look pretty crass: here's an opportunity for<br>
individualist curmudgeons to do something useful with their disdain<br>
for social opinion.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; What about the step from highly optimized designs to very highly </i><br>
<i> &gt; optimized designs? By then we should have AI. And  very highly </i><br>
<i> &gt; optimised attack will almost certainly win over merely highly </i><br>
<i> &gt; optimised defense.</i><br>
<p>
You may well be right about this.  That's why if I were working<br>
in this field, I would be working on defense technologies<br>
(which is what all military-research folks always *claim* to be<br>
working on anyway, especially if they are spending other people's<br>
money, e. g. taxes), rather than optimizing attack technologies.<br>
Fortunately, all medical research is evolving into a<br>
generalized study of real defense technology.  ;)<br>
<p>
If defense designs are kept one generation ahead of offensive<br>
designs, then your last scenario won't come to pass.  If the<br>
next decade is fairly peaceful, then defense designs might just<br>
stay out in front of offense designs.  I still think there will<br>
be some pretty good careers ahead for those who are interested<br>
in figuring out how to amp up the human immune system to deal<br>
with all the new threats emanating from the human nervous<br>
system (where our technologies come from).<br>
<p>
Oh, yeah, and the principle of comparative advantage. I'm<br>
starting to feel that "the principle of comparative advantage"<br>
is my personal "Carthago delenda est" in all these discussions<br>
of future fearsome military competitions between human beings<br>
and their technological offspring.  The only threat I see here<br>
is stupidity.  Anyone with half a brain and the patience to<br>
spend a few months of eir life studying modern economics can<br>
see that initiating warfare is almost always idiocy.  That<br>
doesn't mean we won't have military idiots to contend with, but<br>
it does mean that it's unlikely those military idiots will be<br>
much smarter than us, regardless of whether they are chordates,<br>
uploads, or abacuses.  If they will be so smart, then they<br>
won't be confused by the principle of comparative advantage,<br>
right?<br>
