Robin,<br>
<p>
Here are my reactions to your three proposals:<br>
<p>
1.  "incentive Contracts"<br>
<p>
Seems pretty simple and straightforward.  If you think the economics and <br>
incentives are favorable and easy to justify, the problem in having an <br>
effect on the real world is selling it to insurers, health providers, and <br>
their marketers.<br>
<p>
This may be the most connected to the health policy position you've <br>
accepted, but it doesn't seem to provide a lot of leverage for change, and <br>
the change you'd be pushing for isn't in a direction we care about a lot.<br>
<p>
2.  "Explaining Product Bans"<br>
<p>
This is a fascinating area.  I believe what you said when you started <br>
exploring this idea (as I remember it); this is a path that could lead <br>
(after many years and much work) to a well-known result with a school of <br>
fellow researchers exploring implications.  I think you could make a big <br>
difference in the world with this one.<br>
<p>
3.  "Why do We Disagree?"<br>
<p>
Interesting qeustion but without implication (as far as I can tell)<br>
that push toward a freer society.  My suspicion would be that you<br>
might eventually show that people disagree because they aren't willing<br>
to invest enough to find out where the difference in information is.<br>
Many people are wedded to their positions and would rather keep them<br>
than discover there isn't a right answer; that outcome would leave<br>
them floating in a sea of uncertainty, and they prefer incorrect<br>
certainty to any kind of uncertainty.<br>
<p>
Good Luck,<br>
Chris<br>
