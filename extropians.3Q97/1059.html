<p>
  THE FBI's TWA 800 investigation is being directed by <br>
  an outdated, ineffective, and flawed standard of logic.<br>
  FBI agent James Kallstrom defined the black-and-white <br>
  fallacy of Aristotelian logic the FBI is applying in <br>
  their investigation of the TWA 800 crash [1]:<br>
<p>
      "You don't have a little bit of <br>
      forensics... It doesn't go from 0 <br>
      to 50 percent, it goes from 0 to 100." <br>
<p>
  Kallstrom is saying that a given piece of wreckage is <br>
  either  100% evidence of a crime or it is  0% evidence <br>
  of a crime, it is never a fraction of 100%, such as 20% <br>
  or 60% evidence of a crime. That expresses the standard <br>
  of Aristotelian logic: X is either A or not A, X is not <br>
  both A and not A at the same time. That Aristotelian <br>
  standard of logic is, however, most often false.<br>
<p>
<p>
  SAY HELLO TO FUZZY LOGIC<br>
<p>
  Fuzzy logic is the cutting edge in the field of logic. <br>
  Fuzzy logic establishes that there are degrees of truth <br>
  with respect to a given statement and physical facts. If <br>
  I say that a glass of water that is 70% full is "a full <br>
  glass," that is 70% true (hence the statement is both <br>
  true (70%) and not true (30%) at the same time). [2]<br>
<p>
  If, in accord with Aristotelian standards, we say that <br>
  because the glass is not 100% full, the statement "it's <br>
  a full glass" is therefore 0% true, then we discard 100% <br>
  of the truth about physical facts that the statement does<br>
  contain, which is 70% of the truth it claims to contain.<br>
<p>
  The fuzzy-logic conclusion "Statement X = 70% true" tells <br>
  us more about physical facts than the "X = 0% true" con-<br>
  clusion of Aristotelian logic. Fuzzy is more accurate. <br>
<p>
  The Aristotelian standard of logic the FBI applies dictates <br>
  that if the wreckage of TWA 800 contained evidence that sat-<br>
  isfied the standard  "100% evidence of a missile hit"  by <br>
  95%, such that there was  95% evidence of a missile hit, <br>
  then the FBI would, by the rules Kallstrom has stipulated,<br>
  declare that there is 0% evidence of a missile hit, since<br>
  if there is not 100%, then there can only be 0% evidence.<br>
<p>
  I would say that the TWA 800 wreckage satisfies the <br>
  standard  "100% evidence of a missile hit"  by a very <br>
  high degree: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/crash.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/crash.htm</a> <br>
<p>
<p>
  IN CONCLUSION<br>
<p>
  With Aristotelian logic in hand, the FBI can (a) sweep 99%<br>
  of the truth under the rug, (b) claim there is 0% evidence <br>
  of a missile hit, and (c) still claim to be truthful, where <br>
  a "truthful conclusion" is defined as one derived from the<br>
  flawed black-and-white standards of Aristotelian logic. I <br>
  believe that's exactly what the FBI is doing, and here's <br>
