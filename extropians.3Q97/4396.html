<i>&gt; Here's an interesting take on it:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As an 18-year-old, I was part of the first generation to grow up with</i><br>
<i>&gt; computers.  I was introduced to a Mac Plus at the age of seven (I think).  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; grew up in two realities.  "Click to select" is right up there with "move legs</i><br>
<i>&gt; to walk".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I suspect that I'm also classified as a "singularity rapturist."<br>
I'm 47 years old, and met my first computer at age 20 (I was age<br>
20. It was age 10.) So, you theory may need some modification.<br>
I have been extremely future oriented since age 9 or so because<br>
of science fiction, and I've been a computer professional since<br>
age 21, But I didn't grow up with computers. I've been forced to<br>
the conclusion that the singularity is inevitable, and I'm<br>
optimistic about the outcome, but I still realize that a "positive"<br>
outcome is not the only possibility.<br>
