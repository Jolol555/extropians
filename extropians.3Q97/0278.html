Once again I find myself in the untrendy position of defending Microsoft! I<br>
note that while most companies are slashing research budgets, Microsoft has<br>
recently *tripled* their budget for basic research. They have hired a large<br>
number of exceedingly smart people, especially in regard to advanced<br>
graphics software.<br>
<p>
Whatever truth there was a few years ago in the view that Microsoft was not<br>
creative (a view that I've found exaggerated) has become ever less true<br>
over the last few years. In the years to come, as results appear from their<br>
labs, I think even the Microsoft haters will have to change their views.<br>
<p>
It's Apple that rested on its laurels while Microsoft relentlessly caught<br>
up then, in many areas, overtook. I don't believe it's realistic to blame<br>
all of Apple's woes on marketing. I suspect their cultish approach allowed<br>
them to get lazy. While Apple was busy enjoying being cool, Microsoft was<br>
busy attracting intelligent people and putting them to work at maximum<br>
efficiency.<br>
<p>
Okay, go ahead, call me a corporate lackey.<br>
