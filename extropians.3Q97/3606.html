Yes, I've heard it argued that the Holocaust was merely one in a long string<br>
of genocides.  There have been a long string of genocides.  This is true.  But<br>
the Holocaust stands apart even from them.  11 million people die every couple<br>
of months, simply from normal death rates.  It's not that Holocaust victims<br>
were killed, it's that they were tortured to death.<br>
<p>
Are the survivors of Chad, Somalia, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ceylon,<br>
Birma as scarred mentally as the survivors of the Holocaust were?  Some<br>
Holocaust survivors still sleep with a loaf of bread at night.<br>
<p>
The Nazis took genocide to a new level, not in numbers, but in cold-blooded cruelty.<br>
<p>
I wouldn't argue with anyone who called Chad, Cambodia, or a crack ghetto a<br>
"continuing Holocaust".  Far from mocking the dead, this would prevent similar<br>
tragedies.  Nor would I argue if someone wanted to add a fourth floor to the<br>
Holocaust exhibition, documenting ongoing genocides around the world.<br>
<p>
But, as human history demonstrates, genocide was once as fashionable as<br>
theories of racial superiority.  If not for the Holocaust, we might today<br>
cheerfully dismiss Chad and Cambodia as the extinction of vermin.  By<br>
associating something not instinctively abhorrent, genocide, with something<br>
that is instinctively abhorrent, torture, the Holocaust made genocide as<br>
unfashionable as theories of racial superiority.<br>
<p>
For all I know, in ultimate ethical terms, the 6000 people who die each hour<br>
far outweigh any suffering in the Holocaust; for all I know, a single death<br>
outweighs all the suffering that occurred to all survivors.  But, speaking as a<br>
human, we are simply not sensitive to the deaths of people we don't know.  It<br>
provokes no instinctive reaction in us.  Suffering, on the other hand,<br>
provokes compassion and anger.  And the Nazis systematically inflicted the<br>
greatest density of suffering ever seen in human history.  The Holocaust<br>
surpasses our capabilities of compassion and anger.  Perhaps any genocide<br>
should.  But we cannot grasp a genocide directly; we can only read reports of<br>
it.  The Holocaust stands alone in that even the reports and the pictures are<br>
enough to overload our responses.<br>
