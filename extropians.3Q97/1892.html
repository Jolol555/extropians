Abstract<br>
<p>
    The rapidly improving ability to build atomically precise structural materials of <br>
extreme strength-<br>
to-mass ratio will permit a revolution in aerospace engineering. Graphenes, or <br>
'Buckytubes' may <br>
become available in commercial quantities, allowing the realization of previously <br>
untenable <br>
proposals, such as the 'Skyhook', or geosynchronous tether, for example. A number of <br>
novel <br>
spacecraft propulsion systems and machines are presented, as well as new applications for <br>
some <br>
very ancient devices. The crossbow and other mechanical catapults are re-examined in <br>
light of this <br>
materials development. A design for an electrically powered, automatic Graphene crossbow <br>
capable <br>
of loosing 10 kg payloads at 5 km/sec is presented.<br>
   A Solar System-wide transportation system is proposed by the author for freight and <br>
for <br>
spacecraft propulsion. A network of accelerator/decelerator stations in various positions <br>
around the <br>
Solar System pass 'Smart Pellets' and other forms of matter and energy between each <br>
other, to <br>
planets and other bodies, and to spacecraft in transit. The systems presented here are <br>
amenable to <br>
inclusion in that proposal.<br>
   Between the proposals for particle beam and pellet stream spacecraft propulsion lies <br>
an immense, <br>
largely unexplored spaceflight regime. Pushing a spacecraft using a collimated beam of <br>
mesoscopic <br>
particles, very roughly on the order of a nanogram mass each (plus or minus several <br>
orders of <br>
magnitude), presents new opportunities for high speed interplanetary manned <br>
transportation. This <br>
kind of beam can be tailored in velocity, mass flow, and beam profile parameters to fit <br>
the mission <br>
requirements. The ballistic coefficient, or mass-to-cross-section ratio of this type of <br>
particle is much <br>
greater than single atom particle beams, allowing more precise control over pointing and <br>
dispersion. With atom counts per particle reaching into the millions, molecular <br>
nanotechnologies <br>
may permit the inclusion of entire guidance systems. The receiver onboard the spacecraft <br>
may be as <br>
simple as a pusher plate, or may incorporate particle ionization and magnetic mirroring.<br>
    Combining the concepts of solar sailing and mesoparticles leads to the notion of <br>
mesoscopic <br>
solar sails. A mesoparticle beam composed of thin film sails with nanoscale electronics <br>
and <br>
actuators may be able to accelerate, turn, and navigate itself to a target spacecraft. <br>
Its accelerator <br>
may be the Sun, or a laser located on a deep space 'relay station'. The magnetic sail <br>
analog, though <br>
suffering a scaling disadvantage, is investigated briefly.<br>
   The performance of the rotating tether, or sling, is considerably enhanced by <br>
constructing it of <br>
Graphene fiber. A relatively short sling with a reasonable taper ratio can attain tip <br>
velocities of <br>
several tens of km/sec, along with firing rates of several hertz, making it an attractive <br>
substitute for <br>
the Mass Driver. Scaling down further, the notion of a mesoparticle sling is introduced. <br>
A planar <br>
array composed of many thousands of centimeter-size slings and associated support systems <br>
forms <br>
a type of mesoparticle beam projector.<br>
