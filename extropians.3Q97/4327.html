Just as general info, I will mention some of last acts of the Brazilian<br>
Government, represented by <br>
a demagogic and oportunist Mr named Fernando Henrique Cardoso ( and I even<br>
voted pro him... they "never " show how they really are until they are there<br>
...):<br>
<p>
<p>
1. Normal citizens just will have right to retire at 60 years old ( women<br>
some less), winning, at most, ~    R$14,000.00/y<br>
2. Congressists in just 8 (eight) ys will have same right, and with integral<br>
salary ( &gt; R$ 70,000.00/y) ( very convenient to his intended reelection )<br>
3. He aproved the new Drivers Code: and rejected the obligation of airbag (<br>
the car industries were against before...)<br>
4. Increased the salary of Union's lawyers, and agronomic engineers in up to<br>
200% &gt;&gt;&gt; the responsible minister just said they were indispensable...<br>
<p>
<p>
Just simple examples of the low influence of people in the decisions of the<br>
great majority of governments, so-called "democratic". These  are very far,<br>
f.ex,  from Rousseau's ideia of government,  which should be simply the<br>
executive agent of the State, which, for its turn, would *be* the people<br>
politically organized...   <br>
When will the people have conditions to elect real representatives ??? <br>
( In reallity, this last paragraph is not true: a democratic gov is always<br>
the mirror of its own peoples's personallity... in our case (brazilian) ...<br>
: lack of responsabitity, political disinformation, disorganization and<br>
immaturity... )<br>
