<i>&gt; &gt; 'In order to live, man must act; in order to act, he must make choices;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in order to make choices, he must define a code of values, he must know</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; *what* he is and *where* he is - i.e. he must know his own nature</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (including his means of knowledge) and the nature of the universe in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which he acts - i.e. he needs metaphysics, epistomology, ethics, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; means: *philosophy*. He cannot escape from this need; his only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alternative is whether the philosophy guiding him is to be choosen by his</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mind or by chance.'</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I must plead E-Prime on this one. To ask what man *is* suggests that man</i><br>
<i>&gt; does not *become*. Knowing one's nature and the nature of the universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; in which one exists is IMO the ultimate goal. If I can finally know what</i><br>
<i>&gt; I *am*, then I have stopped evolving. Since time doesn't stand still for</i><br>
<i>&gt; me, I become incorrect about what I *am* only a millisecond later.</i><br>
<p>
The non-static nature of existence is perhaps one of Rand's weak points,<br>
but I don't see it here.  Existence and identity /do/ exist, in the<br>
present tense, in a meaningful way, and this reliance on "becoming" is<br>
in this case an evasion, not a clarification.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For an interesting discussion of E-Prime by one of its major proponents,</i><br>
<i>&gt; check out <a href="http://www.crl.com/~isgs/tobecrit.htm">http://www.crl.com/~isgs/tobecrit.htm</a></i><br>
<p>
Interesting, yes, but a damned poor piece of scholarship.  Lots of<br>
examples of "bad" usage of English and "good" E-Prime, but anyone with<br>
5 minutes reflection can come up with good English and bad E-Prime,<br>
and the fact that he doesn't even try to do so should be a clue to the<br>
quality of the idea.<br>
