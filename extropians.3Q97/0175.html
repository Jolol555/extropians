I have just now found this list. Lorrey and Genen seem to have touched<br>
briefly on a compelling concept during their dialogue: the tendency<br>
towards the "tangent." I'm replying because just last night<br>
while reading Deleuze &amp; Guattari, a reference to Goux: "Jean-Joseph Goux<br>
rigorously anaalyzes the mathematical phenomenon of the curve without a<br>
tangent, and the direction it is apt to take in economy as well as<br>
linguistics: "If the movement does not tend toward any limit, if the<br>
quotient of differentials is not calculable, the present no longer has<br>
any meaning...The tendency finds no end, the thing in motion never quite<br>
reaches what the immediate future has in store for it; it is endlessly<br>
delayed by accidents and deviations. Such is the complex notion of a <br>
continuity within the absolute break(la brisure). In the expanded<br>
immanence of the system, the limit tends to reconstitute in its<br>
displacement the thing it tended to diminish in its primitive<br>
emplacement." (Anti-Oedipus, p. 231). I'm attempting to understand this<br>
myself, yet I do know that this break(la brisure) is absolutely<br>
essential<br>
as an axiomatic of capitalism. It is in operation not only in dialogues<br>
such as these, but also in relation to larger social dynamics. One of<br>
the reasons why schizophrenia as process emerges everywhere within such<br>
a system.(Nomadthought@usa.net)I wish to learn more about extropians and<br>
transhumanism. Ciao.<br>
