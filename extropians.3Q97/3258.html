Yes, this is both interesting and important. It suggests that in<br>
order to survive the accidents we will doubtless get into during our<br>
hopefully extended lives, we should cultivate not just an appreciation<br>
of life but a burning desire to live. It might be a lifesaver.<br>

<p>
Very true. I'm myself interested in how the immune system interacts<br>
with the mind, a research subject which is gradually taking shape.<br>
There is anecdotal evidence that lymphocytes can link up to synapses,<br>
nobody knows what to make of it. <br>

<p>
As I see it, one should accept death, but one should not seek it<br>
or allow it to happen involuntarily if one has better things to do<br>
(i.e. almost everything). The big problem is involuntary death<br>
and to a small extent the present bias of ending one's life when<br>
one really is content with it. <br>
