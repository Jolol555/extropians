<i>&gt;With (at least) one conspicuous exception; the suggestion is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the ancestors of the naked ape lived in shallow water for a time,</i><br>
<i>&gt;like otters.  Such a history explains several features.  The hairs</i><br>
<i>&gt;on our back point toward our spine, as water flows; chimpanzees' hairs</i><br>
<i>&gt;point away from the spine.  We love to swim; chimps are hopeless.</i><br>
<p>
Also we have subcutaneous fat like pigs, otters and other semi-aquatic<br>
animals. Human babies can be born in water and naturally float; try this<br>
with a baby chimpanzee and you end up with a dead chimp baby. Elaine Morgan<br>
has championed this view originally put forward by Sir Alex Hardy in the<br>
1960s in the book "The aquatic ape" (1982, Souvenir Press).<br>
<p>
One of their strongest arguments is that we are have a diving reflex -- put<br>
your body under water and your pulse rate automatically drops to conserve<br>
energy -- and this is something that seems to be lacking in other apes, but<br>
exists in aquatic mammals like the seal.<br>
<p>
In addition to subcutaneous fat our nose and nasal passages are constructed<br>
such that we can dive (and have showers!) without getting water in our<br>
lungs. Again try this with a chimpanzee.<br>
<p>
The idea is that our ancestors learnt to foraged in shallow waters for food<br>
and bipedalism could by explained as an evolutionary pressure to help us<br>
stand upright in shallow waters while we foraged.<br>
<p>
There is even a suggestion as to when this might have happened ~6.5 million<br>
years ago the Danakil Alps in the Afar triangle of Northern Africa became<br>
islands and any in this area would have been cutoff from the African<br>
mainland for over a million years. During this period they may well have<br>
learnt to exploit food along the coast and become so suited to this aquatic<br>
lifestyle that may of the features we now take for granted -- bipedalism,<br>
lack of hair, subcutaneous fat etc had already developed -- when they<br>
returned to the African mainland to continue their evolutionary<br>
development.<br>
<p>
And of course other arguments used for bipedalism (e.g. it developed as a<br>
way to keep body temperature down on the hot savanah) are not incompatiable<br>
with the idea that it originally developed to for a semi-aquatic lifestyle<br>
and then was used by evolution for other reasons.<br>
<p>
The problem with this theory is that it lacks any hard fossil evidence and<br>
I doubt whether any palentologists take it seriously today. Of course its a<br>
little hard to think what would be really knock-down evidence for or<br>
against. And no one seems to have explained why we do have a diving<br>
reflex...<br>
