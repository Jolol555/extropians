This looks like a job for Miss Manners!  Judith Martin (a/k/a said Most<br>
Mannerly One) has written a number of books the theme of all of which has<br>
been that the deterioration of generally intelligible codes of civility<br>
has fueled the disastrous rise of litigiousness in this society (a rise<br>
documented by the likes of Richard Epstein as well).  Where manners fail<br>
we turn it seems to an ever more bloated State apparatus to settle<br>
disputes that concern not the initiation of coercion but outrages of<br>
dignity, petty humiliations and the like.  Look: People are different from<br>
one another. Let's call that -- along with Eve Sedgwick -- "Axiom 1." <br>
Whenever different people fumble into one another there are inevitably<br>
moments of discomfort and dispute.  Very much for the most part, the<br>
examples of "diversity in the workplace" you mentioned -- e.g., workers<br>
who abhor washing, etc. -- are policed into acceptable behavior by cool<br>
glances among co-workers, refusals of lunch invitations, or, as a last<br>
resort, strong words from the supervisor.  Homophobic behavior is likewise<br>
usually mostly unmannerly and ideally would be policed by the same means. <br>
My hunch is that general guidelines concerning the irrelevence of<br>
non-job-related features of an employee's life have so insinuated<br>
themselves into the fabric of the regime of civility which renders<br>
contractual agreements intelligible *as such* that to flaunt them is to<br>
flirt with breach of contract.  (This is a judgment call on my part, a<br>
suggestion for a strategic intervention on behalf of unpopular minorities<br>
that might avoid some of the pitfalls of other more legislative forms of<br>
activist ambitiousness.)  This does not mean that I think it is a good<br>
idea for lesbian and gay activism to make recourse too often to the State<br>
in its quest for civil equality.  Far from it.  As I said, I have heard<br>
that there is a great deal of solid economic research on record that has<br>
supported the contention that a degree of racist, sexist, and heterosexist<br>
behavior intolerable to those who suffer it is nevertheless compatible<br>
with a sufficient rate of profit that few incentives appear to exist apart<br>
from those imposed by the State to ameliorate this behavior.  Part of what<br>
I was thinking is that by forcing those who truly insist on persisting in<br>
irrational behaviors to do so *conspicuously* (i.e., to *specify* the<br>
centrality of homophoia or racism to their general vision), perhaps the<br>
market might actually provide a sufficient regulatory nudge that --<br>
doubtless supplemented by a healy dose of civil disobediance here and<br>
there -- the ideal of *civic* equality might be realized without<br>
supporting the further expansion of the state (and compatible as well with<br>
efforts to hasten the state's diminishment). Of course, all this is<br>
neither here nor there. So long as the state provides support for all<br>
unpopular minorities except lesbians and gays, then that exception itelf<br>
symptomizes a danger that needs to be addressed by activism, whatever we<br>
think about the state as an institution.  The negotiation of the competing<br>
ends of transforming the state (smashing it, as it were) on the one hand,<br>
and working toward civic equality in the world as it is (where an<br>
unsmashed state looms everywhere, as it were), is, to say the least, a<br>
tricky thing...  Heavens, I tagged this BASICS, but it became complicated<br>
quick.  Best, Dale<br>
