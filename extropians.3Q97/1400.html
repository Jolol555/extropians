Apart from the staggering ontological implications, there is one <br>
objection that many philosophers of physics consider fatal: The <br>
Everett theory fails to make sense of the probabilities. For <br>
instance, take a particle that can undergo either of two processes, <br>
and say that according to quantum mechanics the first event (A) has <br>
an 80% chance of occuring, and the second (B) 20%. Now, according to <br>
the Everett interpretation what happens (basically)  is that the <br>
universe splits into two universes; and there is one copy of me in <br>
each of these universes. But if this were the case, then there should <br>
be a 50% chance for me (i.e. *this* copy of Nicholas Bostrom)  to <br>
find that A had happened and a 50% chance that B had happened; which <br>
we know from experiment is not true.<br>
<p>
I don't know of any good reply to this objection that would save the <br>
Everett interpretation.<br>
<p>
<p>
P.S. A serious but very reader-friendly introduction to the <br>
philosophy of quantum mechanics is David Albert's Quantum Mechanics <br>
and Experience (1992).<br>
