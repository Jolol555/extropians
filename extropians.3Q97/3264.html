<i>&gt; The typical Dutch awnser would be 'the middle road' try to combine the best</i><br>
<i>&gt; of both in a mixed model of free market (for efficient allocation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources) and some centralised control (I'll refrain from using the G-word</i><br>
<i>&gt; here ;-) to make sure everybody can have acces to a high standard of</i><br>
<i>&gt; medical care.</i><br>
<p>
That is also one of the likelier possibilities for a change in the<br>
current rules, total de-regulation would be politically hard to implement<br>
but a regulated market system would be somewhat politically acceptable<br>
(it would still be hard to implement, since the first nation to do it<br>
would have to face some criticism from other nations). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think the addition of the right to sell your organs/tissue's, like Lee</i><br>
<i>&gt; Daniel Crocker &lt;lee@piclab.com&gt; suggests (before or after you die) could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; some improvement. It remains trick though, I don't think we want people</i><br>
<i>&gt; having babies for the sole purpose of selling the parts (young/fetal</i><br>
<i>&gt; nervetissue could be very valuable for Parkinsons Disease patients).</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, it would be easy (and politically expedient) to not<br>
include fetal tissue in the donation market. I see no major problem<br>
here.<br>
<p>
On a more theoretical level, I see little wrong with this as long as<br>
it is done before the nervous system has developed too much (how much<br>
this is is another, very tricky question), but I expect others have<br>
very firm views on this matter and it is best to ignore it for the<br>
time being. <br>
<p>
I'm fairly optimistic about the use of immortalization techniques, <br>
embryonal xenografts and other precursor techniques (see Oliver <br>
Brüstle &amp; Ronald DG McKay (1996) Neuronal progenitors as tools <br>
for cell replacement in the Nervous system, Current Opinion in <br>
Neurobiology 6, 688-695)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Just another thought:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "There is nothing in the middle of the road</i><br>
<i>&gt;   besides yellow stripes and dead armadillo's" (anyone know who said this?)</i><br>
<p>
It must have been an American. :-)<br>
