US dollars overseas are not backed by gold, or US gov't services, and<br>

In a sense, modern currency is backed by valuable goods: it is backed by<br>

Gold was hardly useful or practically valuable itself.  Jewelry only<br>
goes so far, and chip wires are new and also probably don't go that<br>
far.  (You can't eat gold.)  But everyone believed that everyone else<br>
would sell food or iron or blacksmithing for gold, so everyone sold<br>
things for gold.  Again, the real backing is mutual agreement, or rather<br>
faith and habit which may get rationalized as mutual agreement.  (Or<br>
they may not.)<br>
<p>
I can't see that there's any serious problem with fiat currency except<br>
the ability to "print" a lot of it, which seems to be generally accepted<br>
as a bad idea these days.<br>
