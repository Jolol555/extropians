     All they (text-to-speech programs) need to do is to get someone to <br>
     record their voice for each word, probably a few different times, with <br>
     different stresses each time.  The problem comes in assembling the <br>
     grammar to fit which stressed words should be used.  Does typical <br>
     grammar apply here or are there new forms of language<br>
     composition/evaluation that can be applied?<br>

     Well, if the text-to-speech freebee (TextO'LE) I got with my <br>
     Soundblaster AWE64 is any indication, the algorithms for constructing <br>
     speech would need to be a little more robust than just a few <br>
     pre-recorded inflections of each conceivable word.  This program hits <br>
     the mark quite often but it does often sound like a Russian with a <br>
     Swedish accent on barbiturates.  And the female voice sounds like me <br>
     on helium and shrooms.<br>
     <br>
     I was "listening to" this programs reciting of "The Long Boom" that I <br>
     downloaded from Wired's web page (more to see if it could tackle some <br>
     of the veverbiage."Internet" and "cyberspace" were very curiously <br>
     pronounced before I added inflection correction (is that like <br>
     conjunction junction?).<br>
     <br>
     I assume this would require more than look up tables to decide when to <br>
     pronounce "lead" as LEED or LEAD or "live" with a short or long "i".  <br>
     That's just one of its shortcomings (but it WAS free).  I was going to <br>
     go about looking for a better program.  If I could capably understand <br>
     (and more enjoy) the inflections and timbre AND it hit more on the <br>
     mark without requiring so much correction, I could "listen" to <br>
     articles and books while making my bed or some other mundane task.  <br>
     Seems like the blind would appreciate this as well.<br>
     <br>
     Any ideas on existing software out there or how to build a better <br>
     mousetrap, I'm listening.<br>
