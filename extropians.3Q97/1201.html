I'm happy you asked, since I'm actually working in this area (human<br>
memory) right now. This is what is sometimes called the "catastrophic<br>
forgetting"  problem - if you teach more and more to a neural network<br>
eventually the stored information will start to interfere with itself<br>
and recall goes down. In some networks (like Hopfield nets) this is a<br>
very sudden collapse from a farily "lucid" network to an useless<br>
"senile"  network. In other kinds of networks (like Hopfield nets<br>
with clipped weights) the disaster doesn't occur, instead old<br>
memories are gradually erased by new ones.<br>
<p>
We don't know what kind of network the human brain is most similar<br>
to, but for a variety of reasons it is likely that it is the later<br>
case. So far nobody has shown any evidence of catastrophic forgetting<br>
(no, Alzheimer is not it, and besides, getting a lot of education<br>
seems to *prevent* dementia instead of causing it). My current<br>
research is looking into how neural plasticity is controlled so that<br>
new memories doesn't erase old ones too fast or too slowly (the<br>
dreade stability-plasticity dilemma). <br>
<p>
What will happen if we can extend our lifespans for (say) 500<br>
years? My guess is that no catastrophic forgetting will occur, but<br>
that newer memories slowly erode older memories. Childhood memories<br>
might be exempt from this, they appear to be very solid. The 500-year<br>
old might remember what he or shw did the last decades fairly<br>
clearly, while more distant eras have been gradually erased ("I have<br>
some vague impressions of the 21st century, but they might be based<br>
on some VR I once saw..."). Often used skills or memories will<br>
likely remain, while less used concepts will fade. It might be a good<br>
idea to regularly do a test to review what fields one need to freshen<br>
up, say every 50th year or so. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If this really is a problem, maybe it's a use for those life-recordings,</i><br>
<i>&gt; no?  It would suck if you lost all the experiences that happened between</i><br>
<i>&gt; childhood and when you get uploaded.</i><br>
<p>
I think it would be a good idea to store them just to be able to<br>
review and document your life for all your future selves. They would<br>
make ideal material for the memory freshening sessions. <br>
