Interesting remarks, Eliezer. Hayek has a lot of thoughts on these<br>
subjects too, in THE CONSTITUTION OF LIBERTY and LAW, LEGISLATION,<br>
AND LIBERTY.  There was also an interesting book by Henry Hazlitt<br>
called  A NEW CONSTITUTION NOW.  And I know that Lee Daniel<br>
Crocker, on this list, has made contributions to the<br>
Constitution of Oceania, which was a recent experiment (not yet<br>
put into practice?) of this sort.<br>
<p>
I am disturbed by your proposal to eliminate the state level,<br>
however. Better to make the "states" smaller and more numerous,<br>
and the federal and "metropolitan" levels less powerful. (Being<br>
an anarchist at heart, I can't really take such scheming too<br>
seriously, though.)<br>
<p>
It's entirely possible that these sorts of structures are far beyond<br>
human engineering skill, and that the US Constitution was partly<br>
a result of careful study of structures that had emerged and grown<br>
without being designed, and partly itself a lucky accident.  This<br>
is why I'd favor a loose confederation of nearly independent states,<br>
who can experiment with a variety of different constitutional<br>
systems without risking screwing up their neighbors societies too<br>
much. Different strokes for different folks, doncha know.<br>
