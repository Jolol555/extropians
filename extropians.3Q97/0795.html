No. First, the statue was *much* too young to relate to the origin of<br>
humanity (the fact that there is an airport today near some runic<br>
stones doesn't mean the vikings had air travel :-). Second, that<br>
people have used psychotropic drugs doesn't show that they have<br>
affected our evolution, just that people have known about them for a <br>
long time.<br>
<p>
Something that might be used to support (or falsify) McKenna's theory<br>
is to compare societies where psychotropic drugs have been used with<br>
societies where they have been rare or not used, and see which have<br>
had the fastest memetic evolution. As a suggestion, what about<br>
comparing Greece and Rome (fairly non-psychotropic as far as I know)<br>
with India (some use, at least) and the indian civilizations?<br>
According to McKenna the amount of novelty among the Atztecs would<br>
have been larger than among the Greeks. <br>
