Thanks to danny (CALYK@aol.com) for posting his favorite links.  Although I<br>
didn't finish browsing them, I did run into one I was happy to find... a<br>
home page for Robert Anton Wilson (<a href="http://www.tcp.com/~prime8/raw/">http://www.tcp.com/~prime8/raw/</a>). <br>
Although I haven't read much RAW, I did read _Prometheus Rising_, and<br>
enjoyed it VERY much.  (I expect I'll get around to reading at least the<br>
Illuminati Trilogy, eventually.)<br>
<p>
Anyway, amongst some thoroughly entertaining stuff, I found one disturbing<br>
item, which I quote here:<br>
<p>
*********<br>
BEGIN QUOTE OF RAW'S "THOUGHT FOR THE WEEK"<br>
<p>
14 Hestia, 76 p.s.U. <br>
<p>
I have lost several friends and colleagues in the last couple of years<br>
(Leary and Burroughs are only the most famous ones) and it has finally<br>
really dawned on me that I am not just "getting older;" I am getting old,<br>
period. Now another friend has cancer, and another is recovering from a<br>
massive stroke. <br>
<p>
I'm glad I have a lot of young friends, because the old ones are all<br>
leaving me. <br>
<p>
Burroughs wrote a lot about preparing for the big casino by getting out of<br>
your body while still alive, via Tibetan and Egyptian methods. Leary also<br>
tried those methods (aided by a Lilly isolation tank) and may or may not<br>
have had his head preserved cryonically, depending on whose story you<br>
believe. I don't regard either of these ideas as preposterous or silly:<br>
Since I know nothing for sure, nothing seems really unthinkable. <br>
<p>
Death makes me realize how deeply I have internalized the agnosticism I<br>
preach in all my books. I consider dogmatic belief and dogmatic denial very<br>
childish forms of conceit in a world of infinitely whirling complexity.<br>
None of us can see enough from one corner of space-time to know "all" about<br>
the rest of space-time. <br>
<p>
Every day is full of wonderments to me: Death will probably come to me as<br>
the greatest wonderment of all. <br>
<p>
END QUOTE OF RAW'S "THOUGHT FOR THE WEEK"<br>
*********<br>
<p>
I had thought that RAW was a cryonics enthusiast.  Instead, this passage<br>
makes me think that he has been influenced heavily by his approaching<br>
death, as was Leary, to the point that he is now comfortable with it. <br>
(Leary was NOT frozen.)<br>
<p>
Two things:<br>
<p>
1)  Can anyone explain to me what's going on psychologically with people<br>
who are on death's door?  How can they spend so much of their thought-time<br>
getting the rest of us to value life so much, only to be willing and ready<br>
to give up life in favor of death the nearer it approaches?  (I actually<br>
have lots of thoughts of my own about this... I'm just looking to hear what<br>
others have to say.)<br>
<p>
2)  Does anyone have any suggestions for what we can do to prevent this? <br>
How many more of our luminaries will go gently, peacefully into oblivion<br>
before we begin to stem the tide?  <br>
<p>
Marvin Minsky and Eric Drexler both finally signed up, and that makes me<br>
feel better.  But I'm sure each of you can think of countless intellectual<br>
influences whose cryonics membership status is non-existent or unknown. <br>
What can we do about it, if anything?<br>
