<i>&gt; From: Anders Sandberg </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In what ways can we</i><br>
<i>&gt; make the personal growth and maturation process more efficient, less</i><br>
<i>&gt; painful and more transhuman?</i><br>
<p>
What you are touching here is really a subset of the apparent conflict, as<br>
seen by many on this list, between:<br>
<p>
Linear &lt;&gt; nonlinear<br>
Mechanical &lt;&gt; biological<br>
Controlled development &lt;&gt; evolution / self organising<br>
Newtonian physics &lt;&gt; chaos theory<br>
Planned &lt;&gt; Random<br>
<p>
I think the solution is to find a balance between these artificial<br>
opposites. All of these things exists. The nonlinear side tends to think<br>
that beacuse many things have a tendency to self organise in an rather<br>
efficient manner, that it is the only way to do things. Also a lot of<br>
people find that because the fractal ideas are new, that they also are<br>
better. That I think is a complete misunderstanding. Extropians and<br>
Transhuman ideals stands for exactly the opposite. Transhumans wants to<br>
controll and transform the universe the way we like it. The most powerfull<br>
force on earth (and perhaps in the universe) is the logic, planning and<br>
controlling mind.<br>
<p>
Chaos theory can help describe complex systems. It dosn't have to be the<br>
way intelligence design these systems to work.<br>
<p>
Your subset is the conflict between Planned education &lt;&gt; Random<br>
experiences.<br>
<p>
It's all part of the thing we call life, and I don't really think that it<br>
can be planned. If you try to plan which part of your education should be<br>
planned and wich should be random, then then there wouldn't really be any<br>
random experiences. :-)<br>
<p>
You can plan to spend a part of your life experimenting though, and that's<br>
probably a vise thing to do.<br>
