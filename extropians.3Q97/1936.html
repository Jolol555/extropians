Yes, it is a promising project, but is only a research program at present,<br>
with no specific plans for actual storage. As one of the original PP pledegers,<br>
($5000/yr, $2000 for pilot project) my motivation here is to help explore <br>
alternatives to liquid nitrogen temperature storage and the associated <br>
freezing damage. _If_ the research pans out I as well as others would switch <br>
to that type of storage, assuming I'm not already suspended in LN2.<br>
In the meantime, Alcor and the like are the only game in town.<br>
