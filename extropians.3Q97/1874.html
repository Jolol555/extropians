<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Here is another excerpt which I thought was an interesting take on a subject</i><br>
<i>&gt; we have often discussed:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Q39  Is linearity exact?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;      -------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Linearity (of the wavefunction) has been verified to hold true to better</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; than 1 part in 10^27 [W].  If slight non-linear effects were ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; discovered then the possibility of communication with, or travel to, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; other worlds would be opened up.  The existence of parallel Everett-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; worlds can be used to argue that physics must be *exactly* linear, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; non-linear effects will never be detected.  (See "Is physics linear" for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; more about linearity.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The argument for exactness uses a version of the weak anthropic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; principle and proceeds thus: the exploitation of slight non-linear</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; quantum effects could permit communication with and travel to the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Everett-worlds.  A sufficiently advanced "early" civilisation [F] might</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; colonise uninhabited other worlds, presumably in an exponentially</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; spreading fashion.  Since the course of evolution is dictated by random</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; quantum events (mutations, genetic recombination) and environmental</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; effects (asteroidal induced mass extinctions, etc) it seems inevitable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that in a minority, although still a great many, of these parallel</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; worlds life on Earth has already evolved sapient-level intelligence and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; developed an advanced technology millions or even billions of years ago. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Such early arrivals, under the usual Darwinian pressure to expand, would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; spread across the parallel time tracks, if they had the ability,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; displacing their less-evolved quantum neighbours.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The fossil record indicates that evolution, in our ancestral lineage,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; has proceeded at varying rates at different times.  Periods of rapid</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; development in complexity (eg the Cambrian explosion of 530 millions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; years ago or the quadrupling of brain size during the recent Ice Ages)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are interspersed with long periods of much slower development.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; indicates that we are not in the fast lane of evolution, where all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; lucky breaks turned out just right for the early development of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; intelligence and technology.  Ergo none of the more advanced</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; civilisations that exist in other worlds have ever been able to cross</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; from one quantum world to another and interrupt our long, slow</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; biological evolution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The simplest explanation is that physics is sufficiently linear to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; prevent travel between Everett worlds.  If technology is only bounded</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; by physical law (the Feinberg principle [F]) then linearity would have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to be exact.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Here he is essentially using the Fermi paradox to prove that travel to</i><br>
<i>&gt; other parallel Everett worlds is impossible.  Of course, the same argument</i><br>
<i>&gt; proves either that travel to other stars is impossible, or that there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; no other civilizations within our past light cone.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Many people believe that neither of these is the case, and that the Fermi</i><br>
<i>&gt; paradox must have some other explanation.  The same belief would invalidate</i><br>
<i>&gt; the claim that MW implies quantum linearity.</i><br>
<p>
In the case of the Fermi paradox, if there are other civilizations <br>
well within our past light cone, and large scale space <br>
colonization is possible, then either they destroy themselves before <br>
they do large scale space colonization, or they take pain to avoid <br>
detection. One of these occurances would have to happen to 100% of <br>
all civilizations in our past light cone. It seems not be absurd to <br>
assume that this is what happens in our universe, but if all possible <br>
series of quantum events actually occur in some world, then there <br>
should be some civilization that miraculously managed to escape <br>
extinction and then happened to adopt a policy of not hiding. So in <br>
the case there are MW then these two answers (self destruction and <br>
hiding) to the inter-worlds version of the Fermi paradox aren't <br>
viable.<br>
<p>
I don't know exactly how the possible non-linearity of the <br>
wave function could be exploited to travel between worlds. It is <br>
imaginable that there would be some limitation analogous to the light <br>
speed. Since there would be extremely many worlds, and the <br>
number would continually explode, perhaps a worlds colonizing <br>
civilization would simply not be able to keep up with the number of <br>
new worlds that are born every second. This could then explain why <br>
our world hasn't been colonized. I think this is a better<br>
objection to the cited argument that MW implies quantum linearity.<br>
