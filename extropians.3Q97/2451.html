     As for the cost...it's getting there...project a little while into the <br>
     future and what will a multimedia net capable computer cost?  I <br>
     dunno...but a whole lot less than it does now...which is about the <br>
     cost of a console type color tv I think...(been a long time since I <br>
     bought a tv...so im not sure)<br>

     Rick Knight adds:<br>
     <br>
     The whole idea of the VERY personal computer needs (and I think is <br>
     preparing for) an overhaul.  I have read about (and jointly envision) <br>
     a computer with no QWERTY (or perhaps just an optional keyboard) <br>
     interface, incorporating pen (like a Pilot) and voice interactivity.  <br>
     It will have smart paper (already in development) which will <br>
     essentially be technologically-realized "magic slates" (remember <br>
     those?).  The "paper" will get fed instructions from the CPU <br>
     binder/cover.  An interface will enable any work, published or not, to <br>
     be displayed on the "pages" and read like a book...text at first, then <br>
     color pictures, then full-motion video, all on a thin piece of paper <br>
     that has been assembled to respond intelligently rather than just <br>
     passively receive some ink blots.  The trees will be so pleased that <br>
     we've made this paradigm shift and so, I imagine, ultimately will our <br>
     lungs (as long as we're bound to using them).<br>
     <br>
     Language has served us well for many centuries but we're still <br>
     clinging to it like it's the end all and be all of communication.  <br>
     Communication needs to be streamlined.  In language, an abundance of <br>
     words need to be eliminated, icons incorporated, media forms enmeshed <br>
     to provide the most time-efficient method of conveying information <br>
     well.  Right now, video is in the hands of major corporation <br>
     interests: the Time-Warners, The ABC-Disneys.  They all have their own <br>
     profit-making agenda.  With the advent of the Internet, information is <br>
     now slowly being dislodged from these bulwarks (although they infest <br>
     the Internet as well...I'm hoping their investment in this medium will <br>
     be either their undoing or their rehabilitation, either would work).<br>
     <br>
     Once information becomes ubiquitous in its availability, I suspect <br>
     business as usual will be a moot point.  Market economy notions are <br>
     headed for the scrap heap.  And questions like Lily poses of Picard in <br>
     the Star Trek: First Contact about the enormous cost of a starship <br>
     will happen substantially sooner than the 24th century.<br>
     <br>
     So, start preparing that essay kids! Here's the topic: <br>
     <br>
     "What would you do if you could do what you dream of rather than what <br>
     is expected of you?"<br>
     <br>
     Regards<br>
     Rick<br>
