<p>
So you've gone a million miles at or around 55 mph. Ever broken a<br>
fanbelt? A radiator hose? a valve or valve lifter? I know the U-joints<br>
on the drive shafts of those babies tend to go...<br>
<p>
Ever get stuck in the middle of nowhere with a breakdown?<br>
<p>
Now, you were operating in a flight regieme of constant surface contact<br>
in a range of 0-75 mph on well paved roadways, that has billions of<br>
manhours of research and engineering behind it, as well as 100 years of<br>
operation of over a billion vehicles under similar conditions. That is<br>
probably the largest engineering base to support the level of technology<br>
in all of our civilization, and they still can't make a starter solenoid<br>
that lasts the life of the vehicle or a cooling system that can run<br>
through the desert without specialized mods.<br>
<p>
Commerical airliners, similarly, have a huge database of flight time,<br>
test, and basic research behind them, so much so that they are the<br>
safest form of transportation around. Yet they still crash, don't they?<br>
Most recently, we have one that blew up over Long Island for no reason<br>
that anyone can agree on, one that lawn darted into the Everglades<br>
because oxygen containers were loaded in the cargo hold, several more<br>
whose wings shattered in  blizzards over the midwest, and numerous<br>
others whose radar and navigation systems weren't good enough to see<br>
mountains in front of them. Locally here in NH, nobody has yet found<br>
that Learjet that dissapeared Christmas Eve after aborting a landing at<br>
our fog draped airport.<br>
<p>
When I made my original post, regarding how the claims of abduction of 1<br>
in 40 persons do not jive with my analysis that shows that given that<br>
abduction rate, we should be seeing a crash rate between 1-12 UFOs per<br>
year. In this instance, I was using commercial airline figures for crash<br>
rates, which are the best around, because I was envisioning these<br>
supposed aliens as operating their abduction operation like an airline.<br>
One fact I left out of my post is that this analysis projected an alien<br>
population on earth of between 40,000 - 100,000 beings needed to provide<br>
support, logisitics, and crewing for this fleet that should range<br>
somewhere between 1000-5000 vehicles. That none of these illegal aliens<br>
have been discovered by our press, or by mom and pop with their shotguns<br>
is indicative of the ludicrousness of the whole abduction thing.<br>
