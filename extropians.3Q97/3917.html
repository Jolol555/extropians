(not related to Rick Knights original question, of which<br>
I unfortunately know very little)<br>
<p>
Just a brief note. I have just returned from a conference<br>
about the military uses of virtual and enhanced reality<br>
(yes, I have a lot to tell). One of the subjects I got<br>
really interested in was information warfare. I had great<br>
fun talking with John Osterholz from the Pentagon about <br>
this, and the general impression I got at the conference <br>
is that truth will be a very scarce commodity in the future. <br>
After all, why crash your opponent's computer when you can <br>
feed him desinformation? And information warfare isn't just<br>
for the Pentagon - everybody can do it.<br>
<p>
The original post gave me a vague idea, inspired by some<br>
other discussions, like memetic civil defenses ("How do<br>
we protect our culture from destructive memes?" - essentially<br>
what a senior officer asked me) and the ideas for a <br>
transhumanist facilitator service. Could it be possible<br>
to form, on a volunteer basis, some kind of "truth maintenance<br>
service" that can in one way or another ensure that at least<br>
some essential facts cannot be distorted?<br>
<p>
<p>
The military-industrial complex is more fun than most think. :-)<br>
