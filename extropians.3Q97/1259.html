<i>&gt; I strongly disagree, I think that's exactly the question.</i><br>
<p>
You see, the proposition asserting the existence of the Mandelbrot <br>
set is not only consistent, it is logically true, i.e. it follows <br>
logically  from the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel's set <br>
theory, the truth of which we do not doubt, do we. So when you ask <br>
whether the Mandelbrot set exists, the answer to your question would <br>
have no relevance to the issue of whether "if something is logically <br>
consistent does that makes it a part of the world?". Hence this <br>
latter question is not *the* question, i.e. not the question we were <br>
discussing, which is the question of the existence of such things as <br>
the Mandelbrot set. (I sense a confusion between consistency and <br>
logical necessity.)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;I do think that the question "Does the Mandelbrot set exist?" needs                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;to be specified and refined. [...] and until you have explained what                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;that notion is, your question appears rather meaningless to me. </i><br>
<i>&gt;            </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You want a precise definition of "exist", I think that would be nice too but  </i><br>
<i>&gt; obviously I don't have one.</i><br>
<p>
I did not say that a precise definition is a prerequisite for <br>
fruitfully discussing the issue; I only said that the question needed <br>
to be made more precise and unambigous than it is. It is a matter of <br>
degree.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; As near as I can tell, Moravec thinks that a mind is the one thing that has </i><br>
<i>&gt; it's own self consistent interpretation inherent within it; in fact that </i><br>
<i>&gt; seems to be the definition of a mind, although you would still need an </i><br>
<i>&gt; interpretation to make contact with it.</i><br>
<p>
I have been eagerly awaiting this new book for over a year now. I <br>
expect there to be clear signs when it finally is released, like <br>
unusually shaped thunder bolts or snow in the middle of the summer.<br>
