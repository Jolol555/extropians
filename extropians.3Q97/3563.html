Your most interesting post made me think of something Nietzsche said about<br>
generosity. I don't have the exact words at hand, but the gist was that the<br>
powerful (he may have said "noble") help the weaker not out of altruism,<br>
obligation, or guilt, but as an expression and outpouring of their own<br>
super-abundant power and health. For those who confuse generosity with<br>
guilt, this is an interesting perspective.<br>
