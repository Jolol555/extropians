As long as we're tossing around personal theories here...<br>
<p>
Agricultural societies will tend towards "civilization", in the<br>
technological sense, anyway.<br>
Why? It is only through agriculture that long term food surpluses can be<br>
created. This leads<br>
to two things: spare time, for intellectual pursuits, and the written word,<br>
used to identify <br>
personal property. Agriculture turns land into a scarce resource, which in<br>
turn creates two <br>
more important things: property rights, and war. Of course, there was<br>
plenty of war before, <br>
but the agriculture makes the spoils so much sweeter, and only those long<br>
term food surpluses<br>
can move and army over long distances. Property rights, of course, allow<br>
individuals to internalize<br>
the benefits of investments, making such investments more likely and more<br>
numerous. These investments lead to two things: taxation, and the formation<br>
of financial structures (lending institutions). <br>
Anyway, I'll stop at this point in history. The bottom line is that<br>
hunter-gatherer societies are too <br>
busy staying alive to mount a manned mission to Mars.<br>

<i>&gt;  &gt; pluralism developed in England and Holland around 1600 to 1700 as</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; a result of a loosely similar situation where trade was easy but</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; conquest hard.  They took lots of (modified) ideas from the Italian</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Renaissance, which in turn had gotten lots of (modified) ideas from</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; the surviving Greek texts.  But, basically, they did it themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You're right about early modern European pluralism. I was confused</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the back of my head by Hayek's arguments in THE CONSTITUTION OF</i><br>
<i>&gt; LIBERTY to the effect that the notion of "rule of law" (as</i><br>
<i>&gt; distinguished from rule of men) was first articulated among the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Greeks and was transmitted in their literature (and that of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Romans, notably Cicero) to modern European political philosophers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But rule of law is a different thing from political pluralism,</i><br>
<i>&gt; though perhaps the historical correlation between the two is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; entirely coincidental.</i><br>
