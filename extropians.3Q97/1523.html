----------<br>
In response to John K Clark's writings, but for the enlightenment of <br>
the whole.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;It can sometimes be observed that a certain meme occurs more    </i><br>
   <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;frequently in (a) certain group(s) of people who clearly (looks,</i><br>
        <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;geography etc) share the same genetic background.  [...] This</i><br>
could         <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;be called "scientifically based racism". </i><br>
<i>&gt;                      </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Racism exists because most animals probably have a gene(s) that makes</i><br>
them  <br>
<i>&gt; feel that their mate should not look very different from the average.</i><br>
It's <br>
<i>&gt; not a totally bad idea because those who look very different are often</i><br>
ill,  <br>
<i>&gt; so this improves the odds that their mate is healthy and that means more </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; children are produced who also have the gene. Like any simple rule of</i><br>
thumb <br>
<i>&gt; it can sometimes make horrible mistakes and become downright ridicules,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; particularly when you put it into a different and much more complex </i><br>
<i>&gt; environment like the modern world. Such caned programmed responses are</i><br>
best  <br>
<i>&gt; for an animal with a brain the size of a squirrel, but Humans are smarter</i><br>
than <br>
<i>&gt; squirrels and can do better, unfortunately they still have that dumb</i><br>
gene.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
These "dumb genes" may get the better of "dumb" people, but<br>
nowadays people are called "racists" when they even try to<br>
imply that certain negative(!) traits are more common with one<br>
branch of humans than with another (if you say: "young blacks<br>
are often good at basketball" there will hardly be any objections,<br>
although this statement is a hardly scientific *generalization*.<br>
Now if you say: "young blacks make up a disproportionally<br>
large segment of the prison population in area X (say, NY)", you'll<br>
quickly be called "racist" (although this is a *fact*). In today's<br>
western memetic climate "racism" which used to mean "unduely<br>
negatively discriminating  against people of a certain genetic<br>
background, persecuting them on mere assumptions" has lost<br>
it's original meaning and is abused by dumb replicators and<br>
manipulative (groups of) individuals to squash any criticism,<br>
no matter how well fundamented (or trivial), of races other than<br>
Caucasians, and most of the time it's a "negro thing". <br>
<p>
"National security" is another examlpe of a neutral term "gone bad".<br>
Right now it is generally associated with shady government operations, war<br>
against it's own people, erosion of constitutional<br>
rights etc. Once upon a time it just meant "securing your borders<br>
against foreign invasions" or something along these lines.<br>
Just like "racism" it has lost it's original meaning, but sneaky<br>
folks still use it as if it were the original to manipulate simple<br>
people.<br>
<p>
What we need, and that's the point of this story, is to either<br>
start using the word (and of course this also applies to "discrimination")<br>
in it's original meaning or invent a new one<br>
so that the "real" racism can be separated from the bogus ones,<br>
and not everything is thrown together. The present situation<br>
benefits no-one (except some manipulative bastards), and it<br>
certainly won't change if no-one dares/wants to discuss it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you're wondering why so many Extropians have such a low tolerance for </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; anything that has the slightest hint of a racist smell, it's because</i><br>
racism <br>
<i>&gt; has never made one thing of value and in fact, with the exception of</i><br>
religion,  <br>
<i>&gt; no meme has ever produced more misery in the world.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                      </i><br>
[re: see above] <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Man, having evolved from an upright killer ape, couldn't have</i><br>
lost         <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;his violent primal urges overnight (on an evolutionary</i><br>
timescale). <br>
<i>&gt;                      </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The "killer ape" theory, the idea that humans evolved from vicious</i><br>
carnivorous <br>
<i>&gt; animals, originated with Raymond Dart, Robert Ardrey distorted and</i><br>
popularized <br>
<i>&gt; Dart's ideas in the dreadful best seller "African  Genesis" in  1961.</i><br>
Dart <br>
<i>&gt; found bones of Australopithecines that had been broken open so the marrow</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; could be gotten to, and Ardrey's imagination ran wild. The theory  has</i><br>
been <br>
<i>&gt; completely discredited for over 20 years, it's now known that the  bones</i><br>
were <br>
<i>&gt; the result of leopards not evil cannibalistic apes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                      </i><br>
What I meant was that primitive man, only just separated from the other<br>
apes, used to be an active killer, whose intellect allowed him<br>
to hunt species (both predators and prey) to the brink of extinction,<br>
and sometimes beyond. This was one fearsome creature, that killed<br>
bears and wolves with only primitive tools. Those genes are still<br>
in there...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Btw, you should see the movie "The Forbidden Planet" (60's I</i><br>
reckon).         <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;It shows what could happen to a (extropian-esque) society when</i><br>
it         <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;loses touch with (or: denies) it's more primitive side. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                      </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, wonderful movie! My dad took me to see it when I was a kid, the</i><br>
first <br>
<i>&gt; movie I ever saw in my life, it scared the hell out of me but I loved it.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Despite corny dialog and a bad last act (Why does the object of wonder</i><br>
always <br>
<i>&gt; have to blow up?) it's still terrific because  of good special effects</i><br>
for <br>
<i>&gt; its time, great music, and one of the most provocative underlining ideas</i><br>
ever<br>
<i>&gt; put  on film.        </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Yes, the special effects were exceptional indeed for the time. Imo<br>
the movie deserves a remake (with the original shortcomings filtered<br>
out and *even better* special effects. The "alien technology" could<br>
be used to promote nanomachines, cryonics, uploading etc. as earlier<br>
(logical!) phases in the alien's technological evolution.<br>
                   <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You're assuming I'm Caucasian, </i><br>
Um, isn't just about *everybody* on this list (which is a fine example<br>
of "white-higher-educated-male-supremacy" [smirk]<br>
  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The recent DNA Neanderthal finding, which proved that we are not</i><br>
descended <br>
<i>&gt; from them, destroyed the only rival to the out of Africa theory, it's</i><br>
pretty <br>
<i>&gt; clear now that not only Homo Habilis but Homo Erectus and even fully</i><br>
modern <br>
<i>&gt; humans originated in Africa. We're all Africans, every one of us.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
It's not *that* clear (there really isn't much evidence one way or<br>
another), but it is widely assumed, and is indeed a plausible<br>
*theory*. It is often used to prove that we're all the same, which is<br>
true to a large extend though it's the "subtle" details that can make<br>
all the difference in the world. <br>
<p>
A theory (can't remember right now who developed it) which I<br>
find very plausible is that certain groups of people moved for<br>
reasons unknown out of Africa, which at that time had a much<br>
more pleasant climate than today, and slowly colonized the<br>
Euro-Asian regions. They were faced by the extreme conditions<br>
of an ice age (or several?) and had to drastically adapt in order<br>
to survive. Only the smartest and the healthiest made it, and this<br>
(or several) "natural selection(s)" gave the later relatives (fair skinned<br>
etc. as an adaptation to the "polar" environment) an edge, it was<br>
a unique evolutional boost whose fruits we still pluck today.<br>
The people that stayed in Africa didn't go through this genetic and<br>
memetic "cleansing", and consequently didn't evolve nearly as<br>
far as their emigrated counterparts. By staying, they outsmarted<br>
themselves, so to speak.  <br>
