(I usually hear "quantum leap", not "quantum jump".)<br>
<p>
Depends on how you use "quantum"; it can mean either the smallest possible<br>
unit of change (if change is quantized), or it can mean a discontinuous change<br>
(if change is usually continuous).<br>
<p>
Thus, when people speak of a "quantum leap", they mean a huge advance without<br>
a lot of little advances, as if the whole technology had suddenly shifted from<br>
one level to another, just as electrons change orbits.<br>
<p>
The idea is not that you've jumped ahead by one quantum of change, since<br>
technological change is continuous (to human observers).  The idea is that the<br>
technology has suddenly started behaving like a quantum system instead of a<br>
continuous one.  The leap was not a leap in a continuous system, it was a leap<br>
in a quantum system.  Hence "quantum leap".<br>
<p>
Perfectly good terminology... I think.<br>
