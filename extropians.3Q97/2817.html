Mary Kay and her 'younger man' _are_ peers.  They _love_ each other. I've <br>
spoken with both of them.  They're glorious people.  Don't you understand <br>
that that's _why Mary Kay_ and the boy were attacked so viciously by the <br>
authoritarian politicians / State prosecutors and others?<br>

Their new baby daughter Audrey is very beautiful, albeit missing early <br>
maternal contact with her mum, who's presently in jail.<br>
<p>
<p>
The boy is _angered_ by the fact that no-oner acting 'for his own good' <br>
_asked_ him what _he_ actually wanted to happen.  They just went agead and <br>
subjected ther woman he loves -- and the mother of his child -- to a <br>
horrifying ordeal.  Books and films are now in progress.  And much else <br>
besides.<br>

     "Dim and yellow against the vibration of the purple-blue shudders the <br>
  faltering light that stands on the tiles of Hidden Lion.  And here is <br>
  Questing the death-hound, here is Elijah for whom Firouz has opened the <br>
  door, hereis Messiah following on Elijah, here is the giant Bohemond <br>
  foul and stinking with excrement that stains his scarlet cross as he <br>
  stands on Hidden Lion lifting his sword vertically with both hands and <br>
  plunging it up and down like a man breaking ground for a post-hole.  All <br>
  around him are broken tiles and among them are heaped gold and silver <br>
  cions that were mortared into the tiles.<br>
<p>
<p>
     Now I see what I have seen before in the darkness and the brightness <br>
  in my mind, I see leaping and still like a butterfy transfixed by <br>
  lightning the elegance of Bembel Rudzuk as he attacks Bohemond; I see <br>
  the great Frankish sword that has been going up and down like a <br>
  post-hole digger suddely leap like a live thing as Bohemond shifts his <br>
  grip and now a track of brightness horizontally cleaves the darkness, <br>
  cleaves the body of Bembel Rudzuk; now in two pieces falls the body of <br>
  Bembel Rudzuk; now in two pieces falls the body of Bembel Rudzuk to the <br>
  broken tiles of Hidden Lion.<br>
<p>
  <br>
  Here now bnefore me is Bohemond.  This is the great moment when I shall <br>
  see the man who has become my world and my jerusalem.  His fouled and <br>
  stiuking mail shirt glitters in the purple-blue luminosity of now, <br>
  his helmet flashes as if wreathed in lightnings; the iron nasal of <br>
  his helmet makes other than human this face I strainm to see but i <br>
  cannot, I shall never see it, I see instead the face of that veiled <br>
  owl of my childhood.<br>
<p>
<p>
     I raise my arm now, I strike with my sword, I see it shatter like <br>
  shards of ice as the great sword of Bohemond makes a *rainbow* in the <br>
  night, in the dawn that is coming.  I stare into the brilliance, I see <br>
  the Virgin and the lion wheeling in the darkness and the light.  I see <br>
  the sun-points dazzling on the sea, the alchemy of the triangualar sail <br>
  changing from the hot and dry to the cold and the wet;  I smell the salt <br>
  breath of Bruder Pfortner.<br>
<p>
     But I cannot see Bohemond in this night and dawn of brilliance, of <br>
     purple-blue luminosity.  No, as the great sword makes another rainbow <br>
     in the pale dawn where hangs the new moon of Tammuz, the last thing <br>
     that I see with my mortal eyes, very very high in the sky and <br>
     circling in the overlapping patterns of the Law, is that drifting <br>
     meditation of storks that I have known from my childhood, each year <br>
     returning to their wonted place."  <br>

<p>
TITLE:           *** WELCOME TO 'PHYSICS/GENERAL' ***<br>
<p>
"... seen as the result of human endeavour, of human dreams, hopes, <br>
passions, and most of all, as the result of the most admirable union <br>
of creative imagination and rational critical thought, I should like <br>
to write 'Science' with the biggest capital 'S' to be found in the <br>
printer's upper case.<br>
<p>
<p>
  Science is not only like art and literature, an adventure of the human<br>
spirit, but it is among the creative arts perhaps the most human: full of<br>
human failings and shortsightedness, it shows those flashes of insight<br>
which open our eyes to the wonders of the world and of the human spirit.<br>
But this is not all. Science is the direct result of that most human of all<br>
human endeavours - to liberate ourselves. It is part of our endeavour to see<br>
more clearly, to understand the world and ourselves, and to act as adult,<br>
responsible and enlightened beings. 'Enlightenment', Kant wrote, 'is the<br>
emancipation of man from self-imposed tutelage . . . from a state of in-<br>
capacity to use his own intelligence without external guidance.  Such a<br>
state of tutelage I call "self-imposed" if it is due not to any lack of<br>
intelligence but the lack of courage or determination to use one's own<br>
intelligence instead of relying upon a leader.  *Sapere Aude!*  Dare to use<br>
your own intelligence! This is the maxim of the enlightenment.' [ref. <br>
6, 'Was ist Aufklarung?']<br>
<p>
<p>
  Kant challenges us to use our intelligence instead of relying upon a<br>
leader, upon an authority. This should be taken as a challenge to<br>
reject even the scientific expert as a leader, or even *science itself*<br>
Science has no authority. It is not the magical product of the given,<br>
the data, the observations. It is not a gospel of truth. It is the result<br>
of our own endeavours and mistakes. It is you and I who make science,<br>
as well as we can. It is you and I who are responsible for it...<br>
<p>
<p>
  The nuclear bomb (and possibly also the so-called 'peaceful use of<br>
atomic energy' whose consequences may be even worse in the long run)<br>
have, I think, shown us the shallowness of the worship of science as an<br>
'instrument' of our 'command over nature' or the 'control of our physical<br>
environment': it has shown us that this command, this control, is apt to be<br>
self-defeating, and apt to enslave us rather than to make us free - if it<br>
does not do away with us altogether. And while knowledge is worth dying for,<br>
power is not. (Knowledge is one of the few things that are worth dying for,<br>
together with liberty, love, kindness, and helping those who are in need<br>
of help)."<br>

EPILOGUE:<br>
<p>
One day, I was speaking with Admiral Gayler at his home in Alexandria, <br>
Virginia, and he said quietly: "I like it here."<br>

Well, alas, not all of do:  I'm listening to this right now:<br>

      "I'm working on a morning flight to _anywhere_ but here<br>
       I'm watching this evening fire burn away my tears<br>
       All my life I've left my troubles by the door<br>
       'Cause leaving is all I've ever known before.<br>
<p>
CHORUS:<br>
  <br>
      It's not the way you hold me when the sun goes down,<br>
      It's not the way you called my name and left me stranded on the ground<br>
<p>
     It's not the way you say you hear my heart when the music ends<br>
     I am just learning how to fly away again...<br>
<p>
REPEAT:<br>
<p>
<p>
       And maybe you were thinking that you thought you knew me well<br>
       But _no-one_ ever knows the heart of anyone else<br>
