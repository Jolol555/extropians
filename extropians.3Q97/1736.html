:         &gt;Switch the legislative branch to an at-large system.  This amounts<br>

: Everybody can't vote for 500 people so somebody would have to decide what<br>
: citizen gets to vote for what congress critter, and this is a huge area for<br>
: potential monkey business.<br>
<p>
What about proxies (as in _The Probability Broach_)?<br>
What about the Hare (single transferable vote) method?<br>
<p>
:         &gt;I should also note that having members-at-large may also fix the<br>
:         &gt;problem where the congress beings spend all their time trying to<br>
:         &gt;get reelected.<br>
:<br>
: Why would that change anything? If a politician doesn't devote full time<br>
: to winning the next election there will certainly be somebody else who will<br>
: and toss him out of office as a result.<br>
<p>
When politicians are seen as interchangeable, selected only for ability<br>
to bring home the pork, I suspect you're right: the permanent campaign<br>
is inevitable.  But if they're decoupled from districts, they can<br>
represent ideological factions; such representatives, I suspect, would<br>
have less competition for their "market segment".<br>
<p>
: The Constitution lasted a long time not because of its perfection but<br>
: because an infrastructure was already in place for it to thrive.<br>
<p>
Interesting!<br>
