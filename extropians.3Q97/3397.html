     Give me an example of (what) the excesses that can and do occur in a<br>

           Rick Knight responds:<br>
          <br>
     See The Tobacco Industry in the early part of this century in the U.S.<br>
     and elsewhere on the planet in recent times.<br>
     <br>
     EvMick:<br>
     <br>
     I don't know about the early part of this century...but currently the<br>
     tobacco industry is heavily controlled....if you consider taxation and<br>
     controls on advertising. I would argue that it does not meet the<br>
     criteria...also I don't see how it could even be considered...it being <br>
     but one industry in the "market" which is very obviously NOT free..<br>
     <br>
     Rick responds:  ...heavily taxed AND subsidized.  Sounds like a dog <br>
     and pony show to me.<br>
     <br>
     EvMick:<br>
     <br>
     The ideal  of a "Free Market" is that of individuals freely buying and<br>
     selling goods and services..by definition if it is not free it is<br>
     controlled....if it is controlled then it is slavery.  <br>
     <br>
     Rick:<br>
     <br>
     Polarized definitions of black vs. White, free vs. Slavery don't seem <br>
     to adequately serve this conversation.  "Free market" is, at a quick <br>
     glance, euphemistic at best.  We banter around the word "Free" in this <br>
     society like it means something but I suppose I'm also taking a lot <br>
     for granted.  Compared to a North Korean in a remote province, I'm <br>
     pretty damn free!<br>
     <br>
     EvMick:<br>
     <br>
     I have no problem with someone killing himself...I don't (nor do I <br>
     want to) own that person...it's his body...his life...his decision.<br>
     <br>
     Rick:<br>
     <br>
     We're going to have a hard time finding common ground because I don't <br>
     share your rather *removed* perspective.  I am more and more convinced <br>
     that if someone suffers, I am suffering.  It's the old butterfly wings <br>
     chaos notion...<br>
     <br>
     Voltaire:<br>
          <br>
     Whoever has power in his hands wants to be despotic; the craze for<br>
     domination is an incurable disease.<br>
          <br>
     Rick:<br>
          <br>
     I regard the inclination to be a despot decreases in accordance with<br>
     an increase of information and a lack of fear unless you are a<br>
     sociopath.  In that case, all bets are off. <br>
     <br>
     EvMick:<br>
     <br>
     I don't agree: Clinton and his cronies are pushing Key Escrow as we<br>
     speak...this INCREASES my fear..Of Government....and yeah...maybe I am <br>
     a sociopath...care to define the term as you understand it?  No <br>
     argument that I'm paranoid.<br>
     <br>
     Rick:  The "right" brand of paranoid though &lt;G&gt;.  To the Industrial <br>
     Age mentality, domination may have been an incurable disease.  I think <br>
     obsession for power is directly tied to fear of survival.  Eliminate <br>
     fear of survival and you, at least, drastically reduce, a need for <br>
     despotic power.  <br>
     <br>
     It's hard to give any viable weight to something that was said at the <br>
     infancy of the Industrial Age (that still echoed Agrarian age <br>
     influence) when we are preparing to eclispse it in this one.<br>
      <br>
     EvMick:<br>
     <br>
     Like  "Give me liberty or Give Me Death"...Patrick Henry<br>
     <br>
     "They that give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary <br>
     safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.  - Ben Franklin, patriot <br>
     and rebel rouser<br>
     <br>
     When I was a boy I was told that anybody could become President; I'm<br>
     beginning to believe it. - Clarence Darrow<br>
     <br>
     I could no doubt come up with lots and lots of statements made at the<br>
     beginning of the Industrial Revolution...or before...from <br>
     say...Newton, Gallileo..Pasteur. Edison. the list is long.<br>
     <br>
     None of that is relevant?  Just because it... "was said at the infancy <br>
     of the Industrial Age (that still echoed Agrarian age influence) when <br>
     we are preparing to eclispse it in this one."<br>
     <br>
     Rick:  There's more of the black/white perspective that you tend to <br>
     filter with.  I have not thrown out the baby with the bath water.  <br>
     Wisdom through the ages *is* relevant.  I find Clinton and company the <br>
     last of a dying breed.  Government is more than overdue for an <br>
     overhaul.  The house of cards will only need a good gust and with all <br>
     the rickety potentials in place (environment, economic, sociological). <br>
      No one wants to give up the scepter.  Whether it's a violent coup or <br>
     an enlightened epiphany, government as usual is being undermined by <br>
     the ravenous acquisition of information by the individual.  I'm <br>
     thankful that I have access to the amount of information that I do <br>
     because it is an adequate size rock for this David to hurl.  There are <br>
     still large portions of the global population who can't or are denied <br>
     access.  <br>
     <br>
     EvMick: We don't still have Agrarian Age Influence...?  I have a <br>
     quarter million dollars worth of John Deere Tractors on my wagon right <br>
     now...not Agrarian?  Toffler (Third Wave) speaks of multiple <br>
     COINCIDENTALLY OCCURING influences.  Agrarian, Industrial, <br>
     Information....Ages...all at the same time.<br>
     <br>
     Rick: Information will enable us to create food in land that is <br>
     essentially barren of any minerals...or create food without using land <br>
     for that matter.  Your John Deere tractors are marvelous constructions <br>
     of the Industrial Age and they may incorporate Information Age <br>
     technology and they serve a purpose.  But information will open up new <br>
     technologies that make a John Deere tractor seem about as practical as <br>
     having an in-dash Victrola. <br>
     <br>
     Eclipsing is a process that occurs over time.  Relax, you'll have a <br>
     job for a while &lt;G&gt;.<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
