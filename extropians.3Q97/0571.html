In a message dated 97-07-15 05:34:55 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; [Aside: Greg Bear likely made it expensive to tone it down in his<br>
 story (which wasn't about nanotech) - cheap, ubiquitious nanotech<br>
 changes things too much, and most authors realize they cannot handle<br>
 all the implications. Linda Nagata and Neal Stephenson are so far the<br>
 only authors I have read who have tried to explore the possibilities. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
It appears so...isn't that irritating?  One of the reasons I love science<br>
fiction is that it's fiction about science...speculative fiction about the<br>
changes in in culture brought about by the advances in technology.(..if this<br>
then .....what?)....&lt;imho..much of what poses for SF today is not...I don't<br>
know WHAT it is...(fantasy? nursery ryhmes?)..but it doesn't meet my<br>
requirements for SF...hence I ignor it).<br>
<p>
In the novel.."Arostoi"..Walter Jon Williams (i think hes the author)..does a<br>
credible job of combineing many emergent technologies .  I read it the first<br>
time and was a little confused...later I read it again and thourghly enjoyed<br>
it...I guess some of the ideas had to ferment for a while.<br>
<p>
And it IS hard...it's easy to be glib and talk about "Singularities" and<br>
"Technological Revolutions" and "The Third Wave"...but i think...(as has been<br>
mentioned earlier)..that most people haven't ..."internalized"...just what<br>
that means..<br>
<p>
Hell...most people don't even have a clear idea of what MONEY is...now try to<br>
imagine a culture that has no need for it?  (James Hogan wrote a novella that<br>
addressed that subject...don't recall the title...had to do with interstellar<br>
colinization..via vat grown embryos under computer control).<br>
<p>
The transition period is what's intriguing...anything beyond a few years gets<br>
TOO fantastic..  but how will nanotech...cold<br>
fusion...biotech...uploading...virtual  and augmented reality be<br>
implemented...in the next few years?  SOON<br>
<p>
I...personally...think it will destroy governments as a concept...and a<br>
society of self-reliant individualists will emerge like a butterfly from a<br>
cocoon...<br>
