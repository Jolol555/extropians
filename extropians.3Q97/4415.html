<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; I said a thousand times, I don't know nothing of economics</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; or english grammar ;)</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Why do you say that? Most people I met in the Internet say I have an</i><br>
<i>&gt; excellent English. Even when I go abroad and have to speak English,</i><br>
<i>&gt; no-one has ever said I had a bad knowledge of the English language,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you're the first and I would like to know why.</i><br>
<p>
You're English is pretty good; he was just commenting on that last<br>
sentence: "I don't know nothing...".  In English, that means you know<br>
something, because the "not" and "nothing" negate each other.  In<br>
Spanish (and Russian and other languages), negatives are cumulative<br>
rather than multiplicative, so "No se nada" expresses ignorance.<br>
You translated the words correctly, just missed a nuance of grammar.<br>
<p>
To further complicate things, many less educated English speakers<br>
incorrectly follow the Spanish rule, and so they /will/ say "I don't<br>
know nothing".  Even educated Americans are notoriously monolingual<br>
and unaware of these cultural and linguistic differences, so they are<br>
likely to mistake your mistranslation for lack of education.<br>
