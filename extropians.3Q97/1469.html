So now we're changing my behaviour so that at that moment I have a lapse of<br>
concentration..... [all the way back to the beginning of time]<br>
 <br>

Now you're changing someone else's behaviour.... [all the way back to the<br>
beginning of time]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  -- an urgent call of nature, contingent on how a bit of food settled</i><br>

<p>
Now your changing the food I ate (and so my behaviour) or the chemical<br>
properties of the food I ate... [all the way back to the beginning of time]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  -- a stab of your cat's claws;</i><br>
<p>
Now you're resurrecting my cat [shame on you]<br>
<p>

The thing is they didn't happen and for any of them to happen you're changing<br>
more than one thing, you're changing everything... everything is a<br>
consequence of everything that happened before it.  There's no escape!!<br>
<p>
For instance: Let's say we flip a coin, there's a 50% possibility of heads<br>
right!?  Possibility is something we have made to explain complex systems,<br>
which we don't understand, can't observe or can't measure.  In reality that<br>
coin is heads was heads and will always be heads.  50,000 years ago that<br>
particular coin, in that place, at that time, in my hand was going to be<br>
heads.  If we knew everything about that coin we would know that it was going<br>
to be heads.  Of course, we can't predict the future because we can't know<br>
the position of everything.<br>
