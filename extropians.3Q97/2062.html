I think it will take less than 30 years.  What we need is to move the brain<br>
to a scalable component software architecture (after which we can use<br>
nanotech to sprawl our grey matter across the universe).  Hopefully we wont<br>
have to make artificial brains as smart as our brain, instead we can meet<br>
half way and then merge the two together (we add computer components to our<br>
brain, the computer adds human components to its brain).  This should happen<br>
when computers develop the ability to learn from us, personal computers<br>
should evolve to be similar to their users; making the convergence of the two<br>
architectures easier.<br>
<p>
After we're scalable and we have all the parallel operations per second we<br>
can possibly build.  It's time to explore new forms of thinking and learning.<br>
 I'm sure that shear speed will not "magically" give us the ability to<br>
understand more, just process information faster.  It's time to start<br>
thinking of what lies beyond our current state consciousness.  Are there<br>
other forms of thought we can adopt? How about conscious memes, each<br>
exploring different situations as individuals to give us a fresh perspective<br>
on new situations (so our old minds aren't put to shame by fresh young ones)?<br>
