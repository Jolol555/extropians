<i>&gt;Aren't you contradicting yourself here?  In fact, advances in software</i><br>

<p>
I never said advances in hardware drive advances in software only the <br>
other way around. Each new version of a Microsoft package requires <br>
faster processors with more memory.  As to weather these newer versions <br>
are better than the old is very debatable.  More features is not <br>
necessarily better software design.<br>

<i>&gt;I''ve got no more than an ordinary end-users smattering of knowledge of</i><br>
<i>&gt;computers, but it seems to me that despite its faults, Win95 is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;definite advance on Win 3.1 in terms of ease of use, speed of running</i><br>
<i>&gt;programs, and multitasking capability.  I *have* spent the occasional</i><br>
<i>&gt;day or two tearing my hair out over some problem, but then I expected</i><br>
<i>&gt;that when I got a computer, because the need for </i><br>
backwards-compatibility<br>
<i>&gt;and the many different manufacturers of ever snazzier hardware and</i><br>
<i>&gt;software having slightly different standards means that there will *</i><br>
<i>&gt;always* be problems.  In fact come to think of it, most of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;complaints of the kind you make seem to forget that a lot of the reason</i><br>
<i>&gt;for Win95's 'bloatedness' is caused by these things, plus the </i><br>
requirement<br>
<i>&gt;that the PC ought to be operatable by even relatively stupid people. </i><br>
<i>&gt;This last requirement is never quite fulfillable, of course, precisely</i><br>
<i>&gt;because it requires a bloated, complex program that is prone to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;occasional problem! :-)</i><br>
<p>
I've been using both Windows and Mac-Based platforms for years.  During <br>
a 2 month period my company kept track of productivity comparisions <br>
between the two platforms.  The results were devastating to the Wintel <br>
Platform - every time a Mac crashed, the Wintel equivalent crashed 6 <br>
times!<br>

<i>&gt;A piss test for taking a job is the employer's privilege.  That is</i><br>
<i>&gt;completely different from govt., because the govt. in no way *owns* the</i><br>
<i>&gt;country.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure I quite follow you here.  The government *owns* the country <br>
in all sorts of ways.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, the bigger operator is still losing money if s/he undercuts; the</i><br>
<i>&gt;bigger s/he is the more money they lose, so in the *long run*, such</i><br>
<i>&gt;monopolies are unsustainable.</i><br>
<p>
Please see my previos post in this regard.  Rockefeller only lowered <br>
prices on gas where he was opening new stations.  This hardly put a dent <br>
in his pocket.<br>
<p>
