Actually, eliminating deficient education would go a long way toward<br>
eliminating the latter, but there will always be stubbornly ignorant<br>
morons. THis is not just a figure of speech, either, seeing as how I<br>
live in upstate New Hampshire. As educated as most people are in these<br>
parts, there is still a significant minority of hereditary locals who<br>
never travel more than 25 miles from their home, don't finish high<br>
school, and are proud of their "downhome", "salt of the earth" status.<br>
<p>
Another big step would be to decriminalize all victimless "crimes".<br>
Doing so would eliminate the social stigma that forces many who<br>
participate in these activites to gain their livihood from further<br>
criminal activity.<br>
<p>
Criminal law should not be used to enforce social norms, but to protect<br>
rights. If you want to practice social engineering, do it with the tax<br>
code.<br>

Dear Michael and other fellow Extropians,
<p>
I couldn't agree more with the need to eliminate victimless
crimes. There are several ggod reasons to do so.
<p>
Actually, among other good reasons, I think it would be 
preferrable to legalize, control and regulate many of them 
minimally in the public interest.
<p>
It would certainly produce sufficient voluntary revenue to help
reduce other forms of oppressive and involuntary taxation.
<p>
As regards those local ignoramuses you are complaining about,
please consider their rationalization of claims to joy in ignorance 
as a defense mechanism. It can be overcome, albeit with some 
difficulty after the formative years; but, it can still be overcome 
with some quite worthwhile effort.
<p>
I hope you all agree.
<p>
Knowledge can be fun.
<p>
A.M. Genen
