<p>
You must know how to contact me, but you don't need to know my physical <br>
location or know what I look like. You must know one of my names, but I could <br>
have others. You might have dealings with 2 names with radically different <br>
reputations and not know and not need to know that both are me. I might make <br>
part of my money honestly and it's important that I have a good reputation <br>
for that name so that people will know by examining my history that if make a <br>
deal they will treated well. I might also make money as a flim-flam artist <br>
selling perpetual motion machines, but I use a different name for that. <br>
As long as you make a deal with the first name you're safe because it's <br>
to my interest to maintain a good reputation for it.<br>

The tit-for-tat strategy is to always cooperate on the first transaction and  <br>
then do what your counterpart does.  If the population is large then most  <br>
transactions will be the first encounter with an individual. This too is an <br>
oversimplification of course.<br>
