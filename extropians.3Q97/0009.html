<i>&gt; &gt; I think that most of us can understand that the leadership of the NRA</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes... that is, after all, their job.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They have concluded that the right to bear arms is not absolute and can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; regulated by the Federal government, the States and and political</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; subdivisions thereof.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You do have a cite for that, of course? I can't think of any supreme court</i><br>
<i>&gt; decision which says that, except the sawn-off shotgun decision (Miller?),</i><br>
<i>&gt; which seems to imply that citizen-units are allowed any weapon suitable</i><br>
<i>&gt; for militia use.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The arguements as to the need for self-defense against predators in our</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; society is best answered by having professionally trained law enforcement</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; officials in each community.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even when US cops are twice as likely to kill innocent bystanders as</i><br>
<i>&gt; civilians are, and when they sell guns to criminals (BATF study in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Washington DC)? Even when studies have shown that legal concealed carry</i><br>
<i>&gt; laws prevent crimes and save lives?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'm a bit dubious as to the need of hunters for many of the rapid fire</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; arms that are readily available as well as the need for handguns.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So? Where does the second amendment mention hunting? Where does it say</i><br>
<i>&gt; that "the right to bear arms" doesn't include handguns?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The collected cumulitive evidence indicates that most people who claim</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they need a handgun for self defense are usually incapable of using one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; under siuations of stress.</i><br>
<p>
Any gun instructor will tell anyone incapable of mastering themselves to<br>
stay away from guns...<br>
<p>
Also, apparently, Mr Genen ignored my prior post last week that included<br>
the results of a study by Handgun Control, Inc., the leading anti-gun<br>
lobbying group out there. The people they commissioned to do the study<br>
(Profs at the U of Chicago) found from FBI data collected between 1979<br>
and 1995 that violent crime dropped an average of 8% in states that<br>
enacted "right to carry" concealed weapons laws in 1994, to take effect<br>
Jan 1 1995. Considering that the FBI reported a 3% drop in violent crime<br>
nationwide, the 18 states with these laws make up 80% of the reported<br>
drop, while the remaining 32 states violent crime rates only dropped an<br>
average of .6%. I think that the difference between 8% and .6% in a pool<br>
in the tens of thousands is statistically significant, don't you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Indeed. Witness the (previously quoted) fact that US cops are twice as</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely as a civilian to shoot an innocent bystander. Taking the cops' guns</i><br>
<i>&gt; away would save a few hunded lives every year.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They frequently end up shooting other family</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; members or themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Indeed, US cops are notorious for killing themselves with their service</i><br>
<i>&gt; weapons (hence the oft-quoted statistic that cops are far more likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be shot with their own guns than by a criminal). But if you're referring</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the notorious Kellerman 'study' I think you should read one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; numerous critiques. It doesn't say what you seem to think it says.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It's possible that the issue of paranoia in our society is entering the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; minds of some of you, as well as the numerous psycho-sexual implications</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of gun collecting,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You're really big on this "psycho-sexual" stuff, aren't you? Personally</i><br>
<i>&gt; when I'm holding a gun sex is normally the last thing I'm thinking of; I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; much more concerned with safe gun-handling. Are you sure this isn't just</i><br>
<i>&gt; something you're projecting on others?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And you have read what Freud wrote about people who are afraid of guns,</i><br>
<i>&gt; haven't you?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         Mark</i><br>
<p>
What did he say? I can always use another quote when I run into anti gun<br>
neurotics...<br>
