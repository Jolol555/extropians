<p>
What is meant by "effectiveness"? How is that any different than<br>
accuracy, and how would anything besides accuracy matter, besides<br>
possibly penetration.<br>
<p>
The anti- weapons systems reports that came out after the Gulf War were<br>
issued by the congresisonal budget office, then under the control of<br>
democrats. The CBO is notorious for twisting and cherry picking data to<br>
fit foregone conclusions, to the benefit of the party in the majority in<br>
congress. Due to this, their reports are not considered by anybody but<br>
the mainstream US media to be worth a hoot, and the media only pays<br>
attention to them when the democrats are in charge there. Granted the<br>
effectiveness of many weapons systems did not, in the final anlysis,<br>
meet up to initial projections, but they also turned out to be nowhere<br>
near as bad as the CBO would have you beleive. This was all covered in<br>
the media, and Aviation Week did a bit of indepth on the whole issue,<br>
exposing the CBO figures as hopelessly inaccurate as the military's<br>
initial projections were in the other direction<br>
<p>
As socialist as the British press is, I imagine that they prefer CBO<br>
data to the truth any day when reporting on US politics. I guess they<br>
still are perturbed by one of our F-111's Paveway bombs hitting the<br>
French Embassy in the raid on Tripoli, after the French denied us<br>
airspace for a direct route. They'd better hope those bombs get more<br>
accurate, you never know when a negative piece in the Times will result<br>
in the misrelease of a couple hundred kilos over a certain office in<br>
London.... ;)<br>
