Yes and no.  Much modern harmony makes use of the ambiguity inherent to<br>
12-tone scale.  A diminished seventh used for a modulation would often have<br>
to have a different tuning to match the chord before it than it would to<br>
match the one following.  Also, if the retuning is "on the fly", in the sense<br>
of not preprogrammed, there is the problem of chords which are ambiguous<br>
until the next chord is played, but which must have been a certain chord once<br>
you've heard the next.  The retuning would have to be done in advance.<br>
<p>
Wendy Carlos has some interesting pieces on "Beauty In the Beast" using<br>
alternative tuning methods, including one that uses retuning while playing to<br>
achieve better chords.  The chords sound very nice but the effect of the<br>
notes changing pitch disconcerts me.<br>
