<p>
On Nova last night, I watched Edward O. Wilson rave about the marvelous<br>
success of ants.  These are social insects, which work cooperatively and<br>
have been very effective in their ecological niche.  They have changed<br>
very little over millions of years due to their success, and in many cases<br>
they dominate the ecology at their scale.<br>
<p>
The reason cooperation can work despite the competitive pressure of<br>
evolution is because all the ants are siblings, children of the same queen.<br>
A gene which encourages cooperation, even when it means sacrificing in<br>
favor of the sisters, may cause its host ant to die, but save multiple<br>
copies of itself in the siblings.  So such genes can spread and thrive.<br>
<p>
When we look ahead to an era where people can have complete control over<br>
their reproduction, the question is whether a similar phenomenon could<br>
occur.  It makes more sense to look at memes (self-reproducing ideas and<br>
customs).  In terms of memetic reproduction, a meme for cooperation and<br>
self-sacrifice could succeed if it sufficiently increased its own spread.<br>
<p>
The loss of a host would eliminate that host as a vector for future spread<br>
of the meme.  This could still be beneficial for the meme, in a couple of<br>
circumstances.  The host's sacrifice could increase the survival of other<br>
hosts of the same meme.  This would be directly analogous to the genes<br>
in the ants.  In this case, we'd expect to see a meme for cooperation,<br>
but only with other people who shared the same meme.  This could be<br>
something like a religion which preached kindness to other people who<br>
share the faith, but not to outsiders.  Other social organizations like<br>
clubs or even racial groups could work the same way.<br>
<p>
Another way that a meme could benefit from its host's sacrifice would be<br>
if that event led to an explosive spread of the meme, like a plant which<br>
casts its seeds to the winds even as it dies.  This might apply to a meme<br>
for heroic sacrifice in circumstances where stories would be told about<br>
the host's death.<br>
<p>
One problem with the first approach is the difficulty of knowing whether<br>
another person is a host of the meme.  With the ants, they can just smell<br>
each other and they know they are siblings.  So the meme might be linked<br>
to some externally visible behavior.  There would still have to be vigilance<br>
for "imitative memes" which mimicked the external behavior but did not<br>
cooperate.  Such a traitor would be denounced and driven out of the<br>
cooperative.<br>
<p>
All these behaviors are actually seen in the world today, to various<br>
extents.  It may well be that they will be preserved even in a Darwinian<br>
ultra-competitive future.<br>
