Actually I would be *very* cautious about this.  What worries me is this<br>
: there's a lot of evidence to suggest that infants are a bundle of<br>
expectations - possibilities waiting to be fulfilled by events in the<br>
world.  This is how nature and nurture interact, in the broad sense. <br>
Artificial wombs would have many positive benefits, for sure, but I<br>
worry that infants raised in them might be mentally disturbed by the<br>
lack of typical womb-like sounds and sensations, and also the responsiveness<br>
and 'feedback' or 'communication' between mother and child in-womb (e.g.<br>
infant shifts position, mother shifts position, stuff like that).  <br>
<p>
If the artificial womb makers are aware of this possibility, and make an<br>
effort to duplicate as much as possible the 'feel' of a true womb (at<br>
least to a degree above the threshold of the infants ability to<br>
discriminate), then no problem.  But otherwise, it's a worry.<br>
