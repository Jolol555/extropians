The more general problem here is the private mistreatment of sentient<br>
beings.<br>
<p>
In the future, it will be possible to create all sorts of minds, with<br>
varying degrees of consciousness, intelligence, sentience, etc.  These<br>
can be created in a state in which they are under the control of the<br>
creator, who can mistreat them as he wishes.  (Think of Vinge's image of<br>
the poor subject being "smeared across a million death cubes".)<br>
<p>
These beings, who could be considered children (this might be a common<br>
method of reproduction in the future, direct creation of new minds),<br>
could be subjected to torture and other forms of mistreatment, within the<br>
privacy of someone's own home (or even within the privacy of someone's<br>
own *mind*).<br>
<p>
Can we expect to do anything about this?  Should we try?  Or must we<br>
just resign ourselves to the fact that some people choose to mistreat<br>
those less fortunate than themselves, and that the laws of nature make<br>
this rather easy to do?<br>
<p>
It's hard to see how to stop it without an omnipresent "blue goo", a<br>
nanotech/infotech police force which monitors all information processing<br>
and prevents the unauthorized creation of minds beyond some level of<br>
sentience.  Not clear that such control is really possible, though.<br>
