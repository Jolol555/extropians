I like to describe it in a slightly different way, which may not be exactly<br>
consistent with Everett's argument but makes the essential insight clearer.<br>
<p>
Normally, QM has two rules: one which describes the evolution of the<br>
wave function over time under normal conditions, and the other, the<br>
collapse phenomenon, which only occurs under poorly-defined measurement<br>
conditions.  Everett's real point is simply to take ordinary QM and remove<br>
wave function collapse.  What you find, surprisingly, is that when QM<br>
phenomena are measured, the measuring device goes into a superposition<br>
of states in which it displays all the possible measurements.  However<br>
these states are decohered to the extent that they have essentially no<br>
interaction with each other.  Therefore you can think of it as though<br>
the measuring device (and the surrounding macroscopic universe) has now<br>
been split into multiple parallel versions.<br>
<p>
The point of this interpretation is not simply to say that the universe<br>
splits when measurements occur.  It is to say, let's investigate what the<br>
world would be like if wave function collapse didn't occur.  And it turns<br>
out, when you work out the details, that you get this effect which is<br>
very much like a universe splitting.  And further, given that the various<br>
disconnected parts of the wave function don't interact, what observers<br>
seem to see is wave function collapse.<br>
<p>
So by taking out wave function collapse, we get a universe in which wave<br>
function collapse is observed to occur.  Hence the two theories make the<br>
same predictions, but Everett's has one less postulate.  By Occam's razor<br>
it should be preferred.  (This is actually a bit of an oversimplification,<br>
since Everett has to make some mathematical assumptions to make his<br>
"apparent" wave function collapse have just the right probabilities,<br>
and so the razor argument is not that strong.)<br>
<p>
I like this way of looking at it better than just saying that the universe<br>
splits on quantum events.  The latter is really a deduction of the theory,<br>
rather than a premise.  And further, it is not a precise statement of<br>
the circumstances described by the theory, which speaks in terms of<br>
wave function components which are decoherent.  Sometimes you'll hear<br>
challenges like "Everett's theory is inconsistent with relativity, because<br>
the whole universe changes instantaneously when a measurement occurs."<br>
I think it is more useful to ask, "how does the quantum state function<br>
change when a measurement-like interaction occurs, given the constraints<br>
of relativity?"<br>
<p>
Also, as I have described it, this is more than an "interpretation" of<br>
QM.  It is actually a different theory, with different (arguably simpler)<br>
premises.  It makes basically the same predictions, except that regular<br>
QM has this sort of blind spot surrounding measurement interactions.<br>
However, when measurements get so precise that complicated quantum<br>
interactions are relevant, and the complex predictions of wave function<br>
evolution would contradict a simplistic wave function collapse picture,<br>
you can be sure that conventional QM will follow the Hamiltonian evolution<br>
process.<br>
<p>
I don't believe that Deutsch's thought experiment will truly be seen as<br>
resolving the issue.  Rather, everyone will agree on what this computer<br>
will do.  Some people may maintain though that the experiment does not<br>
prove the existence of true parallel Everett worlds, any more than<br>
quantum computers do.  Rather, the phenomenon will be seen as an artifact<br>
of the special characteristics of the quantum AI.<br>
