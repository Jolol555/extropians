That is so common a misperception that it makes the many-worlds-faq<br>

Q21  Does many-worlds violate Ockham's Razor?<br>
     ---------------------------------------<br>
William of Ockham, 1285-1349(?) English philosopher and one of the<br>
founders of logic, proposed a maxim for judging theories which says that<br>
hypotheses should not be multiplied beyond necessity.  This is known as<br>
Ockham's razor and is interpreted, today, as meaning that to account for<br>
any set of facts the simplest theories are to be preferred over more<br>
complex ones.  Many-worlds is viewed as unnecessarily complex, by some,<br>
by requiring the existence of a multiplicity of worlds to explain what<br>
we see, at any time, in just one world.<br>
<p>
This is to mistake what is meant by "complex".  Here's an example. <br>
Analysis of starlight reveals that starlight is very similar to faint<br>
sunlight, both with spectroscopic absorption and emission lines. <br>
Assuming the universality of physical law we are led to conclude that<br>
other stars and worlds are scattered, in great numbers, across the<br>
cosmos.  The theory that "the stars are distant suns" is the simplest<br>
theory and so to be preferred by Ockham's Razor to other geocentric<br>
theories.<br>
<p>
Similarly many-worlds is the simplest and most economical quantum theory<br>
because it proposes that same laws of physics apply to animate observers<br>
as has been observed for inanimate objects.  The multiplicity of worlds<br>
predicted by the theory is not a weakness of many-worlds, any more than<br>
the multiplicity of stars are for astronomers, since the non-interacting<br>
worlds emerge from a simpler theory.<br>
<p>
(As an historical aside it is worth noting that Ockham's razor was also<br>
falsely used to argue in favour of the older heliocentric theories<br>
*against* Galileo's notion of the vastness of the cosmos.  The notion<br>
of vast empty interstellar spaces was too uneconomical to be believable<br>
to the Medieval mind.  Again they were confusing the notion of vastness<br>
with complexity [15].)<br>
