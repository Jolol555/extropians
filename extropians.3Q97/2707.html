That's an interesting proposal.<br>

<p>
That means that the singularity is observer-moment relative, and that <br>
it would not occur for me if I find a way to make some meaningful <br>
prediction about the future of intelligence in the universe, even if <br>
everything else make it look like a singularity: immensly accelerated <br>
change, short-cycled positive feed-backs, explosion of computing <br>
power etc. I think the term "singularity" is better used to denote <br>
such an occurrence, whether or not the end result is to some extent <br>
predictable or not. The concept you defined would more accurately be <br>
called "the horizon", and that might also make it less likely that it <br>
will function as a "we can't know anything so let's close our minds <br>
off" devise. (Drexler warned against this version of the concept in <br>
his after-dinner speech at Extro3.)<br>
