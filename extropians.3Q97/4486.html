The idea is that the identity of indiscernibles must be true, electrons are <br>
identical and position can't confer individually, otherwise the Pauli <br>
Exclusion principle which says 2 atoms can't be in the same quantum state <br>
would be untrue, but we know experimentally that it is.<br>
  <br>
The first philosopher to examine the principle of "The Identity Of  <br>
Indiscernibles" was Leibniz 300 years ago. He said that if there is no way  <br>
to find a difference between two things then they are identical and switching  <br>
the position of the objects does not change the physical state of the system.  <br>
Until the 20th century this idea had no observable consequences because <br>
nobody could find two things exactly alike. Things changed dramatically when  <br>
it was discovered that atoms have no scratches on them to tell them apart.  <br>
<p>
Suppose you're looking at two electrons, you may think that you can find a  <br>
difference in them, because one is here and the other one is way over there,   <br>
but can you really? How do you know the particles are not changing positions?    <br>
Would the system be any different if they did? By asking these sort of  <br>
questions and using The Identity Of Indiscernibles we can derive The Pauli <br>
Exclusion Principle, and that is the basis of the periodic table,  and that  <br>
is the basis of chemistry, and that is the basis of life. We can also <br>
discover the fact that there are two classes of particles, bosons like  <br>
photons and fermions like electrons.                             <br>
<p>
Experimentally we can't measure the quantum wave function F(x) of a particle,  <br>
we can only measure the intensity of the wave function [F(x)]^2 because  <br>
that's probability and probability we can measure. P(x) =[F(x)]^2 is the  <br>
probability of finding two particles x  distance apart. Now let's exchange <br>
the position of the particles, the distance between them was x1 - x2 = x is <br>
now x2 - x1 = -x . The Identity Of Indiscernibles tells us that because the  <br>
two particles are the same, no measurable change has been made, no change in <br>
probability, so P(x) = P(-x) . From this we see that [ F(x) ]^2 = [ F(-x)]^2  <br>
so the Quantum wave function can be an even function [ F(x) = +F(-x) ] or an  <br>
odd function  [F(x) = -F(-x) ] , remember (-1)^2 = (+1)^2 =1. <br>
<p>
Both solutions have physical significance, particles with integer spin,  <br>
bosons, have even wave functions, particles with half integer spin, fermions,  <br>
have odd wave functions. If we put two fermions like electrons in the same  <br>
place then the distance between them, x , is zero and because they must  <br>
follow the laws of odd wave functions, F(0) = -F(0)  but the only number  <br>
that is it's own negative is zero so  F(0) =0 . What this means is that the  <br>
wave function goes to zero and  [F(x)]^2  goes to zero , thus the probability  <br>
of finding two electrons in the same spot is zero, and that is The Pauli <br>
Exclusion Principle.<br>
