Hi!<br>

I study at the College of Biotechnology, Oporto, Portugal,<br>

<p>
What about you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; and, as far as I know,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; adding cryoprotectants (glycerol or dimethylsulfoxide mostly) is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; necessary to preserve microorganisms at very low temperatures. They act</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; by preventing the formation of water crystals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; There are indeed complex species (such as some frogs) that can survive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; freezing, they do so by producing a cryoprotectant and then spreading it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; through the body.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Our case is much different, first because we are obviously much more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; complex than any microorganism or even than a frog. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's not a reason, silly!</i><br>
<p>
It ends up being, indirectly, one. Errors occur and since we are more<br>
complex the chances of errors occurring increases. How many times have<br>
you heard of therapies that work fine 'in vitro' and in monkeys and<br>
don't work in humans? Just our brain, is so much more advanced than a<br>
frog's that the possibilities of errors are incomparable. There might be<br>
types of cells in our bodies that doesn't exist in frogs and that will<br>
not freeze the same way as the other cells. <br>
An increase in complexity always increases the potential of errors. BTW,<br>
that is one of the reasons why aging occur in complex animals such as<br>
mammals and doesn't occur in primitive species such as sharks. IMHO,<br>
their evolution lead them to correct the errors in their genome while<br>
our evolution made us consecutively more complex and therefore more<br>
susceptible of having genetic errors or lethal genes. For more see my<br>
next message which is mainly about the evolution of aging.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What's the difference between altering you current brain and genome, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; transferring to a new one?  Is there something special about the neurons</i><br>
<i>&gt; that nature gave us?  And if they're so special, why don't you leave</i><br>
<i>&gt; them the way they are? I'm not so attached to them. As long as I can do</i><br>
<i>&gt; all the same things with my new consciousness-vehicle(or more things), why</i><br>
<i>&gt; should I care whether I've got organic axons or metal ones?</i><br>
<p>
Transferring? Transferring what? Your brain? Your 'soul'?<br>
One idea (that I already though about years ago) is to increase the<br>
viability of our neurons with metal or whatever but this is a continuos<br>
process. Just like now, the atoms that compose my neurons are not the<br>
same that were a few hours ago, exception made to some molecules such as<br>
DNA, our neuron's atoms change continually and I don't complain.<br>
Connecting memory chips to our brain might not be a bad idea but that is<br>
a change and not a transfer. <br>
<p>
I never understood that uploading approach. Consciousness-vehicle? What<br>
is that? A machine with your thoughts? It would take a long time to<br>
change our organic neurons to metal ones and even these would still be<br>
neurons. And, like I mention before, it would have to be a continuos<br>
process and not an instant occurrence.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Don't you think your brain is a bit too fragile?  Personally, I lose</i><br>
<i>&gt; neurons everyday, and they don't grow back.  Don't yours do the same?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Aren't you going to run out eventually?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that's called aging. I intend, in the course of my life, to find a<br>
solution to that problem. I could give a thousand good ideas but that<br>
would be terribly boring for you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; As for evidence, well it's more of a philosophical, theoretical problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rather than a biological one. See the few cases I placed in my last two</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; messages and you'll know what I mean. Personally, I believe (and notice</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the verb to believe instead of the usual verb to think) that I'm my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; brain and that is my conscience.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I cannot debate against someone who "believes."  Have you read Max More's</i><br>
<i>&gt; paper on Pancritical Rationalism.  I see it as a fairly good alternative</i><br>
<i>&gt; to "believing."  Can't you see that belief stagnates progress?</i><br>
<i>&gt; What if you're wrong?</i><br>
<p>
No-one is perfect, we all make mistakes. With the evidences and proofs I<br>
have, which are none, I believe my brain is my only conscience. When I<br>
have some reliable information saying the contrary, I'll change my<br>
opinion.<br>
<p>
Nice talking to you,<br>
