I have to disagree, I see the exact opposite.  Putting destructive technology<br>
in the hands of one person is asking for holocaust, putting it in the hands<br>
of the masses is our *only* chance of survival.<br>

<p>
Hmmm.. that or the possible chance of death.. death please!<br>
<p>
Isn't spontaneous order an extropian principle?<br>
