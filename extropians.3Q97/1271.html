Anders, in common with many people, suggests a mature theory of complexity<br>
as the next big step.  One mighty leap beyond that has been proposed by<br>
Prof Lee Smolin in his new book THE LIFE OF THE COSMOS.  I've only just<br>
started reading this book - which I've been awaiting eagerly for some years<br>
- and find to my surprise that Smolin argues for what one might dub an<br>
`evolutionary nomics' or `general Darwinian nomothetics'.  This is the<br>
notion that fundamental physical and informational `laws' (can't really<br>
avoid scare quotes in such a discussion) are not eternal, Platonic,<br>
existent-even-prior-to-the-Big-Bang, but emergent.  I knew that Smolin<br>
favoured the view that these laws, dimensionless constants, etc, get<br>
remixed with each new budded universe, but I didn't quite expect to find<br>
him arguing that they mutate and evolve *within* a history.<br>
<p>
Some quotes:<br>
<p>
`...one thing I want to communicate... doubt whether the foundations of the<br>
world are indeed to be grasped *solely* by the discovery of a perfect and<br>
eternal mathematical law...  we are beginning to see evidence of an<br>
alternative view... [fundamental order and regularity] might have arisen...<br>
through a process of self-organisation, by means of which the world has<br>
evolved over time to become intricately structured...  I myself rejected<br>
such ideas when I first encountered them.' (p. 15)<br>
<p>
`...I hope to convince the reader that the desire to understand the world<br>
in terms of a naive and radical atomism in which elementary particles carry<br>
forever fixed properties, independent of the history or shape of the<br>
universe, perpetuates a now archaic view of the world.' (p. 18)<br>
<p>
Of course he's not talking talking about the phase changes and uncouplings<br>
at symmetry breaking or anything so simple.<br>
<p>
I have to say that this perspective troubles me deeply.  It smacks of what<br>
I call `black holism'.  But Smolin is one of the smart cookies, and I'm<br>
looking forward to the rest of his book once I get off the phone... <br>
