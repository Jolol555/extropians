I wouldn't be surprised if this has already been discussed, but...<br>
<p>
All I've heard and read of uploading concentrates on taking an intact<br>
brain and "reading it" to another substarate, a non-trivial task by any<br>
measure.  Instead of this approach, how about using a biological brain<br>
as a scaffolding upon which to build an "uploaded" personna.  After<br>
extensive and successive augmentation, the grey matter will matter less<br>
and less. The personna of such a being will begin to spred out of the skull<br>
and into the hardware/software, so eventually the wet stuff will not<br>
do anything that isn't done by the hardware/sotfware.  Take that brain to<br>
the recycle bin-- or what the hell, sell it!  Maybe use it as the seed for<br>
another version of you...  What would you do with your brain if you no<br>
longer needed it? <br>
<p>
Uploading from this approach can for many of us can be considered to<br>
already be underway.  <br>
