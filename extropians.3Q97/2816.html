Someone posing as Abraham Moses Genen wrote:<br>

I know I swore a solemn oath to only post regarding AMG's commentaries when<br>
I agreed with him, but this communication is such utter bilge that I can<br>
only conclude that someone has hacked his account or forged email headers<br>
in an attempt to discredit him. In a comradely spirit, I rise to the<br>
defense of the real Mr. Genen.<br>
<p>
Mr. Genen, I suggest you contact your Internet Service Provider immediately<br>
to see if they can help track down the malefactor.<br>
<p>
Now, I believe that the real Mr. Genen might actually believe in<br>
"collective responsibility"--a concept I personally have a hard time with.<br>
BUT...<br>
<p>
Surely the real Mr. Genen would know better than to claim that _all of us_<br>
"choose to give them...power and authority". <br>
<p>
Add a checkbox for every elected position for "no award--don't fill this<br>
position", and count every eligible voter who does not turn up at the polls<br>
as having voted for same, and the spurious "Mr. Genen" might have a point. <br>
<p>
But of course, we don't have that kind of representation in this country.<br>
We certainly are lucky!<br>
