        Actually (shameless plug here), my current epic poem "The Dawn of<br>
Realization" is going to deal with a lot of the things mentioned above.<br>
Right now, I have based the second Canto on the whole idea of conscription<br>
as well as voluntary warfare; in addition to these concepts, I will also<br>
tackle religion, irrational pessimism and limits in general, just to name a<br>
few.  The whole poem is estimated to be done in about three years, but you<br>
can catch the first Canto in the forthcoming edition of Homo Excelsior<br>
magazine.<br>
