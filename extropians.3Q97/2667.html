<p>
Well, I was kind of attached to spectrum-coding.  Green goo, gray goo, black<br>
goo... blue goo for 'munes... purple goo for Barney...<br>
<p>
I think that we should keep things in perspective.  There's a tendency, which<br>
I fully support, to change the name for "black" every few years(*).  Negro,<br>
black, African-American - it'll be something else by the time nano goes<br>
public.  And, if I may be so bold, "black" was a silly name in the first<br>
place.  They aren't black.  They're brown.  Just like "whites", who are<br>
actually beige.  I'm willing to bet it was some prejudiced fellow who decided<br>
to spectrum-code races with the terms traditionally synonymous with Light and<br>
Darkness.  If you're going to code races by color, call them "beige" and<br>
"brown", including "light brown" and "dark brown", and maybe people will start<br>
to realize how ridiculous it all is.<br>
<p>
Spectrum-coding is a great way to visualize abstract concepts ranging from<br>
battling nanotech to resistor strength.  I'm not going to give it up because<br>
some poor guys got slapped with the wrong end of the spectrum.<br>
<p>
"Red goo" is not an acceptable alternate to "black goo" because nobody can<br>
translate it mentally.  "Khaki goo" is just plain silly.  "War goo",<br>
abandoning the spectrum, is acceptable; as is "death goo".  "Mataglap" would<br>
be fine, since it's easy to translate into Something Evil.  Except that in<br>
"Aristoi", the term was synonymous with any destructive goo, so we'd be<br>
changing the terminology.<br>
<p>
"Black goo" is instantly recognizable as Malevolent Goo.  I've taken to<br>
calling the two sides in chess "chocolate" and "vanilla" so that no prejudice<br>
is implied by vanilla going first.  I offer this as proof of my concern.  But<br>
how we feel about "black goo" may determine the fate of the world.  So I'll<br>
use the most appropriate terminology, with the most appropriate connotations,<br>
and to hell with all racist silliness.<br>
<p>
One of the most trivial applications of nanotech is to change skin colors. <br>
Maybe then the Sneeches(**) among us will quit fighting.<br>
<p>
-- Notes: --<br>
<p>
(*) = Because prejudice does build up, attached to a particular name, and it's<br>
harder to hit a moving target.  What possible harm could a simple change in<br>
terminology do?  (Unless it's a STUPID change, like from "handicapped" to "disabled".)<br>
<p>
(**) = Not a racial slur; Dr. Seuss has a wonderful story - makes racism look<br>
as silly as it is, without preaching against it - about the "Star-bellied" and<br>
"plain-bellied" Sneeches, in which a "Star-off" and "Star-on" machine was invented.<br>
