OOH! OOH! I get to grind one of my favorite axes!<br>
<p>
I agree the drek content has gone way up.  I think some of this comes from<br>
the Extropian commitment to dynamic "optimism".  Really, I maintain the the<br>
purpose of our brains is to figure out what is going on in the world, whether<br>
that's good, bad, or indifferent.  A positive attitude towards problems is<br>
handy; but it's very possible to be too enthusiastic about ideas or<br>
possibilities and ignore reality.  <br>
<p>
I've spent seven years of my life working for companies that made medical<br>
devices.  Both have ended up making relative failures.  In both cases, the<br>
prime problem was that the management was too optimistic and not realistic<br>
enough.  Both devices would have ended up much better if there had been some<br>
hard-nosed attention to the devices' defects, because they were soluble.  But<br>
the people were so convinced they'd invented the greatest thing since sliced<br>
bread nobody bothered to check.  <br>
<p>
Anyway, I see the same with the trepanned chihuahuas here.  They get so<br>
excited about some wierd idea like UFOs being extraterrestial aliens that<br>
they forget that being cool doesn't equal being true.  (Really, being true is<br>
the best kind of cool anyway, but that's another story.)<br>
<p>
It's not just UFOs, though.  There's no more evidence for diamondoid nanotech<br>
than for UFOs.  Drexler and some others have raised the possibility and<br>
addressed some simple issues like building gears; UFOlogists have raised the<br>
possibility and addressed some simple issues like sheilding.  While there<br>
isn't much negative evidence against nanotech, there is some evidence against<br>
ETs in the form of the Fermi paradox; but it's not overwhelming.  And, after<br>
all, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.<br>
<p>
I'd call myself a "dynamic realist".  I really think that would be a better<br>
term for Extropians, at least as it was when I got into it.  Perhaps that<br>
sort of name would discourage the trepanned chihuahuas a bit and encourage<br>
the rest of us to at least wear hard helmets when we start acting that way.<br>
