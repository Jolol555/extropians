I read "StarShip Troopers" as a young boy...I was vastly impressed...and<br>
tended to measure everything in later years using it as a standard...<br>
<p>
That is...Basic Training...(I was In the USAF)...dealings with Government<br>
Officials...College...etc...<br>
<p>
On the whole I prefer the book to reality.<br>
<p>
I doubt I watch the movie...I don't want to mess up good memories..."DUNE"<br>
was a misscarraige..".The Wolven" was an abortion..BladeRunner, (Do Androids<br>
dream of Elecdtric Sheep?),,The Martian Chronicales....and any other SF movie<br>
I can remember was but a pale ghost of the book...but that's true of almost<br>
all movies made from books...to date I've always preferred the book...and<br>
came away from the movie feeling robbed..if not violated...<br>
<p>
Don't think I want to risk that with Heinlein...I liked him a lot.<br>
