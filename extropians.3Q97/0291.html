But what holds one to one's promises?  It isn't some external force, but<br>
one's own will, one's own decision - after all, I *could* break those<br>
promises at any time, if I wanted to.  <br>
<p>
So one is still autonomous: one still owns oneself, one still controls<br>
oneself, by nature.<br>
<p>
One only loses that power if some alien force intrudes on one's control:<br>
and that's what libertarianism has noticed, and emphasises.  The *social<br>
* condition of freedom, liberty, is, effectively, mutual forbearance<br>
<i>&gt;from mutual interference with each others' autonomy, with the kind of</i><br>
exclusive<br>
natural control we *can* have over our minds, bodies and property, to<br>
the extent that we are 'allowed' to by nature's laws and by other people.<br>
