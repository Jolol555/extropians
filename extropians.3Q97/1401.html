Carl Feynman &lt;carlf@atg.com&gt; responded:<br>

<i>&gt; In fact, why stop at stimulating the optic cortex?  Stimulate the</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems,o conscious and unconscious, that get output from the optic</i><br>
<i>&gt; cortex.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, this is what I was trying to say.  I didn't say: "optic<br>
cortex" I said "visual cortex".  The one in the back of the brain that<br>
finally produces our actual conscious visual awareness based on the<br>
date fed to it from the eyes.  The one that produces the visual spirit<br>
world of our awareness that seems to us to be the real world beyond<br>
our eyes but in actuality only models it.  I also tried to mention<br>
that this cortex could be expanded and enhanced to use much more<br>
varied, diverse, higher resolution... qualia to do the conscious<br>
representations as you kind of said here:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is well known to people who take hallucinogens that it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible to perceive colors more saturated than any real percept, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; well as images of far finer resolution.  This indicates to me that</i><br>
<i>&gt; there are internal representational channels in the visual system</i><br>
<i>&gt; whose capabilities are *never* fully exploited by everyday life.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; we could modulate them with meaningful signals, we could make the</i><br>
<i>&gt; world both more beautiful and more informative.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes definitely!  These "more saturated" colors must be<br>
produced by the drugs affect on the primary visual cortex.  Though,<br>
the world wouldn't really be more informative, we would just have a<br>
much more powerful ability to consciously model or be aware of much<br>
more of it.  Consciously seeing beyond infrared and ultraviolet is<br>
much more than simply being able to detect those waves.<br>
Electromagnetic radiation is only arbitrarily mapped to the particular<br>
color sensations we experience and use to represent such in the world<br>
that is our awareness.  In order to see more, we must discover some<br>
new qualia or visual sensation for the detectors to stimulate to<br>
produce some different kind of awareness in the spirit world of our<br>
conscious awareness or mind.<br>
