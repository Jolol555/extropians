<p>
Nicholas Bostrom asks:<br>
<i> &gt; Why?</i><br>
<p>
Much of the cruft and "bad design" that people complain about<br>
in biological systems, at least at the nano level, seems to me<br>
to be rather intricate defenses against hostile life,<br>
especially viruses.  The "junk DNA" that gets spliced out of<br>
mRNA by the spliceosomes in the course of transcription, for<br>
instance. It has been hypothesized that the spliceosomes<br>
developed as a defense against retroviruses, which are capable of<br>
inserting their own DNA into the host germ line.<br>
<p>
I'm starting to suspect that (at the nano level, not at the<br>
macroscopic mechanical level) life is highly optimized for survival<br>
under hostile conditions (where the source of the hostility is<br>
mostly competing life forms).  The incredible dice-rolling device<br>
that generates the DNA that codes for antibodies, etc.  The metabolic<br>
thermodynamic efficiencies, as has been noted elsewhere, are also<br>
rather better than human beings can usually attain with designed<br>
mechanical devices.<br>
<p>
Biological systems often have a tradeoff between toughness and<br>
fecundity. Some species are fragile but extremely fecund, like<br>
mayflies and corals/medusas. The species that are tough (like human<br>
beings) are rarely prolific. The big fear about molecular<br>
nanotechnology is the self-reproducing aspects, the fear of a<br>
highly prolific system.  I think that design tradeoffs would<br>
make the first generation of highly prolific nanotech be either<br>
fragile or extremely energy-inefficient, or both.<br>
<p>
I would expect that we'll have considerable experience in<br>
dealing with prolific nanotech, with energy-efficient nanotech,<br>
and with tough nanotech long before we ever have to face off<br>
against nanotech that has all three of these properties.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; And even if that is the case, don't forget that the step from rather</i><br>
<i> &gt; optimized designs to highly optimized designs might be fairly quick,</i><br>
<i> &gt; and if that's the step that creates the big military potential,</i><br>
<i> &gt; then...</i><br>
<p>
This speculation usually rests on the idea that we will, in<br>
parallel, have developed AIs or easily replicable uploads that<br>
will be able to do good engineering work far more rapidly than<br>
present-day human beings can.  Otherwise, I think Carl<br>
Feynman's estimates that the capabilities of nanotechnology<br>
will unfold over the course of several "technology generations"<br>
(and not in one fell swoop) are on the mark.<br>
<p>
I doubt that uploads will be possible without molecular nanotechnology<br>
for use as probes to determine the structure and processes of a<br>
living brain in order to accurately simulate it.  So I don't think<br>
we can rely on uploads to speed up nanotech development and<br>
substantiate your fears.  We'll have plenty of experience with<br>
nanotech (and time to develop defenses) before we have any uploads<br>
to accelerate the development of nanotech.<br>
<p>
That leaves non-upload AI, which I grow increasingly skeptical<br>
about. (This could change any month, though.)  Minksy and Lenat<br>
and a lot of other people who know a lot more than I do are probably<br>
going to hate my saying this, but the most plausible course of<br>
attack in this field right now looks to me like playing with feedback<br>
nets using a bunch of different unsupervised-learning algorithms.<br>
I am pretty sure that most such systems that have been built have<br>
produced no behavior more interesting than catatonia, but I would<br>
expect that if non-upload AI has a future, this is where it's going<br>
to come from. (I'm not ready to lay any money down on this prediction,<br>
though.)<br>
<p>
The problem, as Minksy would probably point out, is that such<br>
systems are intractable.  Well, there are lots of systems that used<br>
to be intractable that aren't anymore.  Heart surgery was an<br>
intractable proposition five hundred years ago.  I don't know what<br>
it would take to make working with those sorts of systems intellectually<br>
tractable, but I'll probably spend a little while thinking about<br>
it.  I'm sure I won't be alone in this.<br>
<p>
What it comes down to for me is that a lot of our intuitions about<br>
the possibilities in future technology is based on our common<br>
understanding (common among extropians, at least) that we are<br>
physical beings, that our very bodies are existence proofs for<br>
nanotechnology and that our brains are existence proofs for<br>
physically-embodied intelligence.<br>
<p>
I would expect the first physically-embodied artificial intelligence<br>
to follow the "intractable" patterns of the existence proof. There<br>
is no existence proof for physically-embodied artificial intelligence<br>
based on an abacus architecture.<br>
