So holding a gun out to someone and burning their cocaine plants is<br>
force (and therefore bad), but destroying them through an engineered (or<br>
even a non-engineered) virus is not?  Perhaps you think that gently<br>
injecting someone with HIV is not murder, as long as you don't hold them<br>
down while you do it.  If not, please explain the difference as you see<br>
it.<br>
<p>
<p>
Depriving someone of life, liberty or property through your intentional<br>
actions requires force, in my book, regardless of the means which you<br>
employ.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;The problem lies not within any humans but within the</i><br>

<p>
Oh, this is ridiculous.  The problem is not a plant.  The problem is<br>
that certain people, either for psychological or physiological reasons,<br>
prefer the plant to the alternatives, which causes them to use force to<br>
hurt other people.  Simple as that.  If someone wants to drug<br>
themselves, as long as they don't hurt anyone else who are you to force<br>
them to live?<br>
