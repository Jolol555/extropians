[[Nostagia??? Extropian? <br>
Wasn't there a thread on S/N ratios a while back, with some proposals <br>
for increasing it? Maybe it's time to implement some IT breakthrough<br>
or other. I'm partial to a dynamic rating system, perhaps maintained at<br>
the Extropy site. It might also help with the sludge factor if people <br>
can<br>
'see themselves as others see them'.]]<br>

I agree the drek content has gone way up.  I think some of this comes <br>
from<br>
the Extropian commitment to dynamic "optimism".<br>

[[Yes, this is one of the Extropian tenents I disagree with. Wishful <br>
thinking<br>
has to be clearly distinguished from critical thinking. This is not to <br>
disparage<br>
the notion of 'inventing the future'.]]<br>
<p>
 A positive attitude towards problems is handy; but it's very possible <br>
to be <br>
too enthusiastic about ideas or possibilities and ignore reality.  <br>
<p>
Anyway, I see the same with the trepanned chihuahuas here.<br>

[[This item does not belong here at all. Perhaps a reposting of the <br>

It's not just UFOs, though.  There's no more evidence for diamondoid <br>
nanotech<br>
than for UFOs.  Drexler and some others have raised the possibility and<br>
addressed some simple issues like building gears; <br>
<p>
[[Um, here I have to chew on your leg a bit. Drexler's more restrained <br>
position (as<br>
opposed to the popularizations in "Engines of Creation") is a <br>
plausibility arugument<br>
for one type of nanotech, put forth mostly as a conceptual engineering <br>
study. Building<br>
his type of gears is actually one of the most difficult parts of the <br>
argument, as they involve<br>
a lot of energetically unfavorable bond strain. I don't know why <br>
Foresight continues to<br>
use one for its logo. "Globus Gears" made by more conventional <br>
synthesis on carbon<br>
 nanotubes are looking very promising, maybe even just around the <br>
corner.<br>
   There has been something of a sea change in the scientific <br>
community's acceptance<br>
of the feasibility of molecular nanotech, if not of machine-phase <br>
chemistry, over the past<br>
 year. Even Eugene Leitl seems to be softening up. Richard Smalley may <br>
have a cogent<br>
argument against positional control of chemical reactions, but I don't <br>
think he addresses<br>
it from an engineering perspective- that is, simplifying and <br>
restraining the system. There<br>
are just too many ways to workaround the problems. I put much more <br>
stock in Richard<br>
Feynman's argument, he is after all the originator of our most perfect <br>
physical theory.]]<br>
<p>
UFOlogists have raised the<br>
possibility and addressed some simple issues like sheilding.<br>
<p>
[[An extraterrestrial starship approaching Earth would have a very large electromagnetic and<br>
particle signature! Unless of course it is a nanoprobe.]]<br>
<p>
  While there<br>
isn't much negative evidence against nanotech,<br>
<p>
[[As in 'zero'.]]<br>
<p>
I'd call myself a "dynamic realist".  I really think that would be a <br>
better<br>
term for Extropians, at least as it was when I got into it.  Perhaps <br>
that<br>
sort of name would ... encourage... us to at least wear hard helmets <br>
..<br>
<p>
[[Yes, I'd go along with that.<br>
