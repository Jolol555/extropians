<i>&gt; By your definition. How about when humans aggress against animals? Is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; immoral?</i><br>
<p>
If true universal morals are only those which are prosurvival, then the<br>
only violence against animals is that which may cause negative<br>
environmental impact that would impact another human. In this way,<br>
hunters are morally obligated to hunt wild animals at a level which<br>
sustains the populations in the ecosystem. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Where does the *concept* of morality come from if not the primethic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;decision?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Presumably, the concept arose originally from somebody's imagination.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;For what purpose?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Who knows? Maybe it just seemed like a good idea at the time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You're being evasive. Where does the concept of morality come from? For what</i><br>
<i>&gt; purpose?</i><br>
<p>
Morality is a result of a culture's memetic system. How well that<br>
culture survives and grows is a result of how closely the memetically<br>
established morality system dovetails with prosurvival activities.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why, when we view a dispute between humans, do we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;judge who is *right* and who is *wrong*? Do *all* people do this, or just</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;those who have made the primethic decision?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Beats me. Does it matter?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;If all people do this, then the primethic is not a decision, but a human</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;instinct.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Are you suggesting that morals are instinctual?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Possibly. The primethic does seem to be widespread. It's entirely possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; that amorality vis a vis A/D could be learned behavior, with the primethic</i><br>
<i>&gt; being instinctive.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;defense against aggression is amoral...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It isn't, ever.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Because of the definition of 'aggression'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;Only in your dictionary.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Perhaps, but my definition of 'aggression' is not much different from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;common useage, and the dictionary definition works well in all but very odd</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;situations. Your definition of 'primethic' has more serious problems.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Such as?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What real world phenomenon forms the basis of your definition?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Language. In my particular case: the english language.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;You're being evasive. Words describe things. Aggression is not limited to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;human interaction, nor does the word describe a moral judgement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I disagree. In order to label something as 'aggression', it is necessary to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;have already made a moral judgement of the 'aggressive' act in question.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;'Aggression' is a morally-loaded word, and 'aggression' is _always_ a 'bad'</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;thing. I agree that the word is sometimes mis-used and applied to animals,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;but I think that is simply a mistake - anthropomorphism. Similarly, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;word 'aggression' is sometimes mistakenly used to describe violence</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;employed in self-defence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Consequently, I think it might be important to be rigorous about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;definition  of 'aggression', to avoid confusion and misunderstanding. I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;stipulated a definition for 'aggression' that makes sense to me and isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;too different from correct common-useage. If you prefer a different</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;definition, we can certainly look at different one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Virtually any statement can be made valid by simply changing a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; definitions here and there. Be that as it may, even if your definitions were</i><br>
<i>&gt; widely accepted, they prove nothing. Argument by definitions is nothing more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than argument by assertion, substituting, "because the dictionary says so"</i><br>
<i>&gt; for "because I say so."</i><br>
<p>
Note the caveat at the biginning of this particular thread. The<br>
definition of agression used is that of the english language, which<br>
necessitates that the cultural view of the word "agression" be that of<br>
the Judeo-Chirstian memeplex. Other cultures have different memetic<br>
relationships with their words for agression.<br>
<p>
As an example of this difference, I'd like to examine the word<br>
"gratitude". Gratitude is seen as a positive moral behavior that one<br>
expresses when one is the beneficiary of another's intended or<br>
unintended generosity. In no form do english speaking peoples see the<br>
word gratitude as having a negative cultural connotation. However, in<br>
the chinese, korean, and japanese languages, there are numerous words<br>
synonymous with differing levels of gratitude, and the ideograms for<br>
those words all contain ideograms that represent varying levels of<br>
resentment.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Like all concepts, they come from the imagination - the mind. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;interesting question is, how do some things come to be deemed 'moral' and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;other things come to be deemed 'immoral' and many other things fall into</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;neither category and are therefore 'amoral'?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;The primethic decision.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;If the primethic is truly a decision, then some thought must go into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;decision-making process. What thoughts would be relevent? What factors</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;would be considered prior to making this "primethic decision"? Certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;not any self-defense or survival issues, we've already agreed that those</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;are instinctual and instinctual responses require no thought at all. So...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;What remains?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The primethic may very well be instinctive, but I haven't thought of any way</i><br>
<i>&gt; to prove it...yet. Not all survival tactics are instinctive. For those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; are less successful at aggression, or prefer to sleep without one eye open,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the primethic may present a means of peaceful coexistance with their</i><br>
<i>&gt; neighbors. If many share in that decision, then all are safer.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The fact that people feel that defense (against human aggression) *itself*</i><br>
<i>&gt; is moral, and human aggression *itself* is immoral, as opposed to just</i><br>
<i>&gt; aggression against oneself being immoral, would tend to indicate that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; primethic may be instinctive.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Actually, British courts have found that sadomasochists can be<br>
prosecuted even though those being inflicted on agree to the treatment.<br>
