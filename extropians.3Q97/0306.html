<i>        &gt;With regards to Rockefellers tactics, your facts of history are         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;wrong. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Be specific! I gave a number of facts, which one was wrong?<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Rockefeller did not have to lower his prices everywhere - &lt;only in         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;those places he was opening new gas  stations&gt;.  History shows this         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;worked quite well to his advantage.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
And this is how Rockefeller made his money??? It sounds like a wonderful  <br>
opportunity for anyone, EXCEPT Rockefeller, who has access to a truck to  <br>
become very rich. Buy a bunch of widgets where they're dirt cheap and truck <br>
them to where they're sky high. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;They're not out of business because they ARE the business.  What         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;people feel about Microsoft is largley irrelevant to what choices         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;they have when buying a  computer.  Between the advertising of Intel         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and Microsoft a new computer buyer thinks that if it din't say      </i><br>
<i>        &gt;"Intel Inside" it's not a computer.                   </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The only crime Microsoft and Intel have committed is in being successful,<br>
a peculiar sin for a Extropian. Imagine the screaming we would hear if Apple <br>
had won and had "unfairly" crushed Microsoft. Apple would not only be king of <br>
software but of hardware too. For some reason people love to pick on a leader, <br>
when Netscape clearly had the best software everybody dumped on the company,<br>
now that Microsoft has started to catch they get the black hat. <br>
             <br>
It's true that if you were starting from scratch lots of people could make a <br>
more consistent, more elegant, system than Wintel, but Microsoft and Intel <br>
didn't have that luxury. Everything they made had to be compatible with <br>
everything they made before, this imposes a severe burden, but a burden the <br>
most popular operating system in the world MUST bear. If the Many Worlds <br>
Interpretation is correct, I predict that on nearly all those worlds people <br>
are complaining that the most popular operating system is an ugly mess, <br>
a inelegant hodgepodge of kludges. Such is the fate of things that are not <br>
designed all at once but evolve and grow, things like English with it's weird <br>
spelling, or biological organisms for that matter.<br>
<p>
It's in the nature of things that standards are resistant to change, but <br>
that's OK because that is exactly the way a standards should be. The lack <br>
of popularity of the Apple or Next or Bee or whatever operating system  is <br>
not an example of market failure  because in the context of the real world <br>
they are in fact inferior system.  If everything else was equal they  would<br>
be better than Wintel  but everything else is not equal. These systems have <br>
some small technical advantages but that is countered by enormous practical <br>
disadvantages, they will not operate on the type  of computer most people <br>
have and it will not run billions of dollars worth of popular software that <br>
took thousands of man years to write.  It's perfectly valid to take such <br>
things into account when deciding what system is really superior.  When a <br>
standard is set it's just not worth going to a new one unless you get an <br>
astronomical improvement. The market has decided that the Apple or Next or <br>
Bee is not a huge advance of that type. Maybe the market is wrong but I know<br>
it has a better understanding of such things than a bunch of hack politicians.<br>
