<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Personally, I don't know. I do know of the things I saw when I was in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the Air Force that I still can't talk about. Given that all of the stars</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a 50% chance that we've been visited in the past or will be visited</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; within the next 100 years.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Why would the next 100 years be any more special than the last million?  Or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the next million?  On someone elses timetable it should make no difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Because of the light speed balloon of radio signals we are constantly</i><br>
<i>&gt;pumping out. Sooner or later, someone is going to notice at the very</i><br>
<i>&gt;least a drastic change in the radio noise level from this quiet little</i><br>
<i>&gt;yellow dwarf we orbit around. SInce most of the stars in our neigborhood</i><br>
<i>&gt;are of similar age, its higly likely that we are temporally coexistent</i><br>
<i>&gt;with another intelligent race within 100 ly or so. Given that we will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;heading out within the next 100 years, its equally likeley we will</i><br>
<i>&gt;either find them, or we will find each other.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Possibly, but will our very weak (relatively) radio source be detectable<br>
among the myriads of strong radio sources?  Will they even be looking?<br>
Will they care?  They may not even exist on a planet that has an atmosphere<br>
that is particularly transparent to radio waves.  We are making large<br>
assumptions regarding the motives, interest, and capabilities of a<br>
hypothetical advanced race.  Even a distance of 50 ly is prohibitively<br>
large based on our current understanding of physics.  They might not even<br>
be interested in making any type of contact with us, to the point where<br>
they go out of their way to avoid us even assuming they have developed<br>
strong interstellar capability.  A race that was simply looking for<br>
resources in other systems might prefer to avoid us to prevent possible<br>
contention.  Consider all the unoccupied yet equally accessible star<br>
systems available.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;A civilization a mere 100 years ahead of us technologically should have</i><br>
<i>&gt;interstellar capability now and be heading this way. If they are more</i><br>
<i>&gt;advanced, then they could already be here.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then again, the situation could be that we are the most technologically<br>
advanced society in our neck of the woods.  Within a 100 ly sphere, this is<br>
a very plausible possibility.  IMO, our best odds of finding ET<br>
civilizations is to go out and look ourselves.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;I didn't make an argument about whether we have, or will be, visited. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;simply tried to say that if anybody was able to visit us thru space, they</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;would probably be able to do so without us detecting them in any way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I agree.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I am sure the aliens are seriously upset with the disturbing and uncanny</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ability of rednecks and trailer trash to spot their stealthy craft.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hey, Murphey doesn't give a damn about stealth. At least three of our</i><br>
<i>&gt;own stealth planes have crashed, for all their advancement. Stealth does</i><br>
<i>&gt;not mean that you're invisible to a drunk sitting on his porch or a</i><br>
<i>&gt;co-ed getting porked in the back seat, just that such a vehicle is</i><br>
<i>&gt;designed for "low observability", not "unobservability".</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I was presuming that the stealthy craft were of super-advanced alien<br>
origin.  Of course our stealth aircraft have much more limited capability.<br>
"Stealth" as currently applied means hard to detect via electronic means.<br>
As for crashing, "stealth" aircraft have very ordinary airframes and are<br>
subject to the same laws of physics as any other aircraft.<br>
