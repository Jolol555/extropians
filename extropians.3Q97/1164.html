I suspect that people operate with the wrong model of memory -- the<br>
brain isn't a "recorder", and I'm far from certain we have enough room<br>
to really "record" fourty years of experience faithfully, let alone<br>
140. We certainly do forget large chunks of the "less important" stuff<br>
and possibly so that there will be "room" for the newer stuff.<br>

<i>&gt; If we don't make his assumptions, do we still think this will be a big</i><br>
<i>&gt; concern?  If we fix Alzheimer's, what are the reasons to think that</i><br>
<i>&gt; long-term memory is more limited for 140 year olds than for 40 year olds?</i><br>
<i>&gt; If this really is a problem, maybe it's a use for those life-recordings,</i><br>
<i>&gt; no?  It would suck if you lost all the experiences that happened between</i><br>
<i>&gt; childhood and when you get uploaded.</i><br>
<p>
It might suck, but I have come to accept it. If it bothers you a lot,<br>
I suspect a diary might be a simple low-tech way to deal with the<br>
problem.<br>
