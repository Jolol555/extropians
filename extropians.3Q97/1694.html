<p>
Welcome back Eliezer! You were gone too long.<br>
           <br>
<i>        &gt;Inefficiency enters when an unnecessary abstraction makes it possible </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to short-circuit a desired link. </i><br>
<p>
Very true, so dump government, the middleman.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Switch the legislative branch to an at-large system.  This amounts </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to setting up a 121 (1-to-1 correspondence) between voter and </i><br>
<i>        &gt;congressbeing.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Everybody can't vote for 500 people so somebody would have to decide what<br>
citizen gets to vote for what congress critter, and this is a huge area for<br>
potential monkey business.<br>
<p>
                <br>
<i>        &gt;Only constituents whose 121-elected representatives voted for an </i><br>
<i>        &gt;item of spending are taxed to pay for it.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The strongest argument nationalists have, and it's not very strong, is that<br>
government can deliver a public good, your proposal would eliminate even that.<br>
<p>
If a dam is built my constituents will get a lot of benefit out of it, but if <br>
I don't vote for it then they get it for free and in gratitude reelect me in<br>
the next election. The constituents of the moron who did vote for it have to<br>
pay for the damn thing and this makes them very unhappy so they vote the<br>
idiot out as soon as they can.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I should also note that having members-at-large may also fix the </i><br>
<i>        &gt;problem where the congress beings spend all their time trying to get </i><br>
<i>        &gt;reelected.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why would that change anything? If a politician doesn't devote full time to <br>
winning the next election there will certainly be somebody else who will and<br>
toss him out of office as a result.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Do we really need State-level governments?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
We need it just as much as Federal-level government and that's just as much<br>
as a fish needs a bicycle.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;How's this for a First Amendment (Amendment 2.1:)</i><br>
<i>        &gt;"Excepting copyrights, government secrets, and {anything else crucial </i><br>
<i>        &gt;I've forgotten}, no law shall be made which mentions or refers to </i><br>
<i>        &gt;speech; press; pictures; electronically stored information; any </i><br>
<i>        &gt;information which can be expressed as text, speech or pictures; any </i><br>
<i>        &gt;communication of the aforementioned items; or any other form of </i><br>
<i>        &gt;communication or information.  Nor shall the law  mention or refer to </i><br>
<i>        &gt;patterns within this information."</i><br>
<p>
<p>
A big step backwards, at least the current first amendment says nothing about<br>
exceptions. With loopholes this big government thugs could stop anybody they<br>
didn't like from saying anything. I think that if you want to keep a secret<br>
from me then it's your responsibility to do so, not mine. If you fail I see<br>
no reason why I should be punished for your error.<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;Amendment 2.2:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;The total sum of words within all government regulations, including</i><br>
<i>        &gt;this constitution and all government forms, but excepting regulations</i><br>
<i>        &gt;which apply solely to government employees, shall not sum to more</i><br>
<i>        &gt;than 100,000 words or 500,000 letters, whichever is less.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Federal regulation 89723 says " Government shall see to the efficient<br>
operation of the economy" and nothing else. Those truckloads of papers over<br>
there are not regulations, just guidelines.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Nonlinear number-of-votes to representational-power curves, for</i><br>
<i>        &gt;congressbeings, to prevent dictator/messiah problems.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Elections are dumb, an idiotic way of communicating your wishes, there are<br>
much better ways. Every day I send hundreds of exquisitely precise messages<br>
to the Free Market telling it what I want it to do. I also get to compare<br>
brands, I can't do that In a democracy because I'm not voting for goods or<br>
services or even policies, I just get to choose between two grab bags of<br>
promises every 4 years, and democracy is the best form of government,<br>
the best of a bad lot.<br>
 <br>
When I vote in the economy by making a purchase I am sure to get it, I always<br>
win. When I vote for the grab bag I may or may not get it. At any rate, the<br>
chances that my vote will influence things is so small that it's not worth<br>
my time to study the issues very deeply, the result is that the politician<br>
with the better hairdo gets to make the decisions.<br>
                              <br>
<i>        &gt;How many levels of government do we a priori need? </i><br>
<p>
Zero.<br>
           <br>
<i>        &gt;cities should be free to belong to the "state" of their choice, </i><br>
<i>        &gt;or none at all.</i><br>
<p>
Take the next step, give that right to individuals also.<br>
                                                    <br>
<i>        &gt;there are numerous psychological forces acting to screw our designs.  </i><br>
<i>        &gt;The Constitution succeeded because - through a fluke of luck or </i><br>
<i>        &gt;otherwise - these forces were barred from acting.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The Constitution lasted a long time not because of its perfection but because<br>
an infrastructure was already in place for it to thrive. Without a lot of <br>
people willing to obey it and enforce it and interpret it, the Constitution<br>
is just a bunch of words on a piece of paper.<br>
                                            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;the Constitution continues to operate perfectly against tyrants</i><br>
<p>
Perfectly?<br>
           <br>
<i>        &gt;other menaces such as bureaucracy and paperwork are threatening to</i><br>
<i>        &gt;choke the country, and might very well do just that, if continued</i><br>
<i>        &gt;unchecked.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed.<br>
           <br>
<i>        &gt;Something* needs to be slapped into place, and I have no faith in</i><br>
<i>        &gt;stopgap measures to do it - like putting a band-aid on an axe wound.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, but you're proposal to fix government is just a band-aid. Limited<br>
government has been tried many times but is does not stay limited for long.<br>
It seems to be in the fundamental nature of a state to increase it's power.<br>
A state has power an individual or corporation does not have or it would not<br>
be a state, it's inevitable that it will use that power, however small it<br>
starts out to be, to gain even more power, the process increases <br>
exponentially until people can take it no more.<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Capitalism still requires far more computing power, however. I</i><br>
<i>        &gt;believe that the near future, now that we have the computing power,</i><br>
<i>        &gt;will be an extremely streamlinked place.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'm not sure what you mean by this but if you're talking about designing an<br>
efficient economy forget it, that will never happen. Yes, computing power is<br>
increasing rapidly, but for the very same reason the thing you're trying to<br>
model is increasing too.<br>
                                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Money will be replaced by complex barter</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Some truth in that, and government will no longer have a monopoly on money,<br>
you could use any currency you like best. And more, with strong encryption<br>
anonymous re-mailers, DC nets and untraceable digital cash, I will soon be<br>
able to make complex financial agreements with you even if you're on the<br>
other side of the world, and NOBODY including government regulators or taxmen,<br>
could know anything about it. That's one reason I think the nation state will<br>
soon go the way of the city state.<br>
      <br>
