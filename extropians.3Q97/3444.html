<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I might have been too cursory, but that website didn't convince me</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the least about neo-tech. In fact, it almost looked like a SubGenius</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; parody of extropianism; a lot of rants against mysticism, the IRS</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and the current irrationalism interspersed with promises for immortality,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; prosperity and romantic love. There appeared to be some good ideas </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in the texts, but I tend to get sceptical of people who spend more</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; time denouncing their detractors than actually getting to the point. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Actually, it's more of a SubGenius-like parody of Objectivism.  In fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;the charter of Usenet group humanities.philosophy.objectivism states</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the group was created and moderated specifically for the purpose of</i><br>
<i>&gt;banning them, by name, from cluttering the discussion.  Nothing in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;neo-tech world is original, interesting, or need be taken seriously.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
This is largely true, although every so often the neo-techies express a<br>
fairly conventional Objectivist viewpoint in a rather nice way. They<br>
also lay into the Peikovian pseudo-Objectivist cult regularly. Otherwise<br>
Neo-Tech seems to be straight Objectivism with a load of self-invented<br>
jargon added (fully integrated, golden helmets - which sounds slightly<br>
rude - pips, Zon-power and the like), grandiloquent and grandious claims<br>
about their founder and about their legal battles, achievements and<br>
prospective achievements and promises of personal power and prosperity<br>
that sound like those of various other self-improvement and esoteric<br>
cults.<br>
<p>
Has anyone done a proper expose of Neo Tech? Who are its organisers, and<br>
what have they really done. Are they self-deluded ("honest" cultists) or<br>
simply fast-buck merchants ripping-off Objectivism?<br>
