If *you* can survive that long without evovling, I'll be impressed.  If<br>
*you* beat pi while your at it, I, or more likely whatever being<br>
descends from me, will bake you a cake! 8-&gt;<br>

<p>
*Limit* does not refer directly to object or action X that can't be<br>
achieved obtained, but to the *inability* to do or obtain X.  That<br>
inability is part of the identity of whoever wants X.  To overcome a limit<br>
is synonymous with overcoming inability.  To overcome an<br>
inability/limit to get X, one must change something about her/his<br>
identity.  I'll skip the exposition on evolution, but changing one's<br>
identity to overcome some obstacle sounds a lot like "adaptation" as the<br>
word is used with regards to evolution.  I hope someone will comment if my<br>
understanding evolution is flawed.<br>
