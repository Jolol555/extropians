Kathryn Aegis quoted:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Gerhard Richter, painter and essayist:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;'I have committed myself to thinking and acting without the support </i><br>
<i>&gt;of any ideology.  Nothing can help me, there is no idea I can serve </i><br>
<i>&gt;or which, in exchange, could suggest what I must do.  No regulation </i><br>
<i>&gt;determines how, no belief points the way, no construction or vision </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the future provides an overarching meaning.  Ideologies are always </i><br>
<i>&gt;the seducers and exploiters of ignorance, they justify war.'</i><br>
<p>
Ayn Rand, writer and philosopher:<br>
<p>
'In order to live, man must act; in order to act, he must make choices; <br>
in order to make choices, he must define a code of values, he must know <br>
*what* he is and *where* he is - i.e. he must know his own nature <br>
(including his means of knowledge) and the nature of the universe in <br>
which he acts - i.e. he needs metaphysics, epistomology, ethics, which <br>
means: *philosophy*. He cannot escape from this need; his only <br>
alternative is whether the philosophy guiding him is to be choosen by his <br>
mind or by chance.'<br>
<p>
'As a human being, you have no choice about the fact that you need a <br>
philosophy. Your only choice is whether you define you philosophy by a <br>
conscious, rational, disciplined process of thought and scrupulously <br>
logical deliberation - or let your subconscious accumulate a junk heap of <br>
unwarrented conclusions, false generalizations, undefined contradictions, <br>
undigested slogans, unidentified wishes, doubts and fears, thrown <br>
together by chance, but integrated by your subconscious into a kind of <br>
mongrel philosophy and fused into a single, solid weight: *self-doubt*, <br>
like a ball and chain in the place of where your mind's wings should have <br>
grown.'<br>
<p>
So there!  : -)<br>
