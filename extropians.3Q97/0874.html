<p>
Why not, I believe in UFOs and have seen lots of them, everybody has. I'll <br>
bet that if I went outside right now I would see something I couldn't <br>
identify in a hour or two. Big deal. People forget what the "U" in "UFO" <br>
stands for, my only objection is when people insist on turning a UFO into a <br>
IFO and "identify" a light they saw in the sky as a starship from planet <br>
Munimula.                 <br>

I think there are 2 root causes of junk science, one is noble and one is not. <br>
<p>
1) People feel a sense of awe when they contemplate the universe, as well <br>
   they should. Mystics, Scientists, religious people and flying saucer nuts <br>
   all have this in common.<br>
<p>
2) Laziness. Junk Science fans remind me of kids who gorge on jelly beans,  <br>
   they just wallow in awe and don't do their homework that would allow them   <br>
   to explore and find an even deeper beauty.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I'm sure someone in the know will pipe up with the likely political </i><br>
<i>        &gt;allegory tied to the woman in the shoe story  </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
It's no allegory it's cold hard fact. My uncle told me his neighbor had a <br>
friend who's brother heard a man in a bar say that his former commanding <br>
officer dated the sister of the man who cleaned the pool of the postman of <br>
the CIA interrogator of the son of the old lady who lived in the shoe. Well <br>
one of the sons, she had a lot of children actually. <br>
<p>
This is IRONCLAD proof that the story is true, there is no other possible  <br>
explanation. The fact that there is no physical evidence of any sort for any <br>
of this must mean there is a huge conspiracy of government and the evil <br>
moneyed interests to suppress this technology because it would turn <br>
comfortable footwear into affordable housing for all. <br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;although I don't think it's a cold war connection &lt;G&gt;.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not so,  poor housing caused a lot of resentment in the Soviet Union and was <br>
one of the reasons for its downfall. Now that the cold war is over there are <br>
signs that the tight grip over the old lady's technology is starting to <br>
loosen up, you will note that basketball shoes have gotten much more <br>
sophisticated since 1989, further proof that there was an old lady who lived <br>
in a shoe and she had so many children she didn't know what to do.<br>
