Hugo de Garis is interviewed by Wired and describes his views of the AI<br>
future.  He foresees the creation of super-intelligent AIs, "artilects"<br>
(artificial intellects).  The race to create these AIs will be, along<br>
with the nano race, a principle form of competition in the next century.<br>
<p>
Some will favor creating these machines, which are arguably our<br>
replacements: the Cosmists.  Others will oppose them, the Terrans.<br>
de Garis sees the future somewhat similar to Moravec, with the Cosmists<br>
escaping from the Earth, dominated by Terrans (rather confusing choice of<br>
terminology there).<br>
<p>
Moravec suggested that this would lead to temporary stability, with<br>
the AIs in space leaving the earth alone for some time while their own<br>
skills matured, but de Garis sees a more violent short-term outcome.<br>
The Cosmists will seek refuge in space where they can build their<br>
artilects, while the Terrans will pursue them with intent to destroy.<br>
The Cosmists will need to develop their own offensive capabilities as<br>
quickly as possible in order to counter the threat from the Terrans.<br>
<p>
Meanwhile de Garis is working on building a million neuron milli-brain<br>
based on a new configurable cellular automaton chip from Xilinx.  Then<br>
he'll use evolution (or should we call that directed evolution?) to try<br>
to make the brain smart.<br>
<p>
Sounds like he's got a ways to go before his machines take over.<br>
