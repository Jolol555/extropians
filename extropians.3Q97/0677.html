     I spent some time on his mailing list last year; he seems like a loon <br>
     to me, or at least to loudly ignore any evidence against his theories <br>
     (the few people who openly questioned the theories on the list soon <br>
     gave up and left). In fact the general list philosophy seemed to be <br>
     taking 'intution' over evidence and ranting against scientists.<br>

     I'm sure that's how a few of the less empirically-minded types on this <br>
     digest sometimes feel.  In my mind (not quite as eccentric as <br>
     McKenna's I think due to far less transpersonal excursions), the <br>
     middle path of instinct/hunch/intuition that can be (but isn't <br>
     compelled to be) proven is preferable.  The human brain is still a big <br>
     enigma and the whole question of consciousness, unless smugly reduced <br>
     to a well-honed succession of chemical and electrical interactions is <br>
     still a vast area due some serious study.  <br>
     <br>
     McKenna's life has been a very lengthy research experiment.  The <br>
     cautious person may raise an eyebrow to some of his eccentric notions <br>
     but he is one of the few people whose words have so entranced me.  Is <br>
     he just a wacky but adept spin doctor?  Maybe.  But doesn't that put <br>
     him on the same list with some of our great thinkers and inventors?<br>
