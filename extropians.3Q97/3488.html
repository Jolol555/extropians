This is what I mean. Before signing up (if &amp; when this becomes possible in<br>
Holland) I must be convinced that the best way to spend $50K - $120K is<br>
freezing my head then I will. From where I stand now these are large<br>
amounts and at this point I believe there are better ways to spend that<br>
kind of money. Preferrebly  I'd like to use it myself on something usefull<br>
or fun, but maybe it will help people I care about. Or maybe there will be<br>
a doctor in Kathmandu who's fighting lepracy that has some use for<br>
$100.000, save a few lives (for sure!)<br>
<p>
The bottom line is that I consider the revival chances at this time to low<br>
to spend money on in view of alternative use of such a resource.<br>
<p>
I'll be following cryo-technology with interest.<br>
