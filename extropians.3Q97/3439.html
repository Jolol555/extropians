<p>
Pardon?  I fail to see the tyranny here.  No extropian is forcing you to<br>
evolve.  If you just sit there and don't adapt, you will be defeated by<br>
entropy... it seems to me that is the very principle of Extropianism! <br>
Personally, when I stop evolving, I will be dead. If you choose to not<br>
evolve, I think you will find your closest peers will soon <br>
be chimpanzees...<br>
<p>
I have a hard time even addressing this post, because it is based entirely<br>
on laziness.  Technology will give us the *potential* to do things we've<br>
never dreamed of, and you would waste that potential "passing the joint"?<br>
If your purpose in life is to not have to worry about it, why don't you<br>
just die?  This is definitely NOT a suggestion, but I'd like to hear what<br>
your purpose is, or if you have one?<br>
