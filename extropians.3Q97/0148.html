If one applies the term self defense to mean protection of one's self,<br>
property, and dependents from violators of ones rights, whether they be<br>
individuals, gangs, mobs, or any level of government, then you are<br>
exactly right. Law enforcement agencies are only there to dispense<br>
justice after the fact, not to provide protection services. It operates<br>
by threat of punishment as a deterrent (which apparently is not that<br>
effective), not by threat of deadly force against offense. If the<br>
individual feels that the deterrent of law enforcement (which applies at<br>
local, state, interstate, and international levels) does not meet their<br>
needs, they are free to pursue means of self defense. Since Article Ten<br>
defines the "militia" as any male between the ages of 18 and 40 (or is<br>
it 45?), and also states that local sheriffs are empowered to<br>
temporarily draft from the militia pool for local law enforcement needs<br>
(where the "posse" concept came from), it is apparent that the<br>
constitution intended every member of the "militia" to have authority<br>
and responsibility for law enforcement within the confines of their own<br>
property and family.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In that context automatic weapons...not to mention rockets..mortars or pocket</i><br>
<i>&gt; nukes seem perfectly acceptable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Indeed, if you strictly apply the liberal interpretation of the 2nd<br>
amendment, that arms posessed by the people are to only provide for the<br>
militia, being necessary for the security of a free state, then assault<br>
weapons should be mandated for every member of the militia, therefore,<br>
every male between the ages of 18 and 40 or so should be required to<br>
posess such armaments. Perhaps those who refuse to posess meand of self<br>
defense should be fined for deriliction of social responsibility.<br>
<p>
of course, saying this to an anti gun liberal typically puts them in<br>
apoplexies of confusion.<br>
<p>
I find another funny parallel, in rural Washington State, every county<br>
but I beleive King, Thurston, Pierce, and Snohomish have passed in the<br>
past three years county ordinances requiring every homeowner to posess a<br>
gun and ammunition. Needless to say, studies have shown that crime has<br>
gone down in those counties, while it is unchanged or up in the counties<br>
that have not passed such ordinances.<br>
