     &lt;snip&gt;<br>
     When posts are made that insult (extropian) memes, it insults each <br>
     individual extropian...it is insulting each extropian's way of life.  <br>
     When claims are made that one is more extropian than another, it <br>
     breaches that respect which is ever so important.  When a<br>
     person does not possess the few mandatory memes mentioned above yet <br>
     claims to be an extropian, that is a disgrace to the lifestyle.  When <br>
     one worships mystical beliefs that are not provable and have no <br>
     reason, then that person should not call themselves extropian. =20<br>
     <br>
     By ranting like this, I am extrapolating upon the way *I* live and my <br>
     perspectives.  I hope that I have not offended anyone by involuntarily<br>
     trespassing on the grounds of *their* perspectives.  If I have stepped <br>
     on any toes, please tell me so...it won't hurt me.<br>
     <br>
     Rick responds:<br>
     <br>
     It's a modest little think tank e-mail digest, not a front page slam.  <br>
     My advice is to relax a bit, step back and look at (and even enjoy) <br>
     the interesting sociological dichotomy of the personalities and the <br>
     way they respond.  Look at how you yourself have responded.  <br>
     Extropians insulted?  I was under the impression that what set them <br>
     apart was their extraordinary ability to transcend, including rising <br>
     above the ostensibly petty slings and arrows of those who would deride <br>
     them.  Personally, the confidence in my own intelligence and even the <br>
     systems of belief I've woven is armor enough against belligerent or <br>
     hostile exchanges I may encounter in cyberspace.  And that's another <br>
     thing, you're reading text, likely from folks you've never even met.  <br>
     We can infuse *so much* drama into words that were never intended.  <br>
     Looks to me that the only toes you might be stepping on are your own.<br>
     <br>
     Lightly,<br>
     Rick<br>
