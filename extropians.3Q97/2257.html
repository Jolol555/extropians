This is a most unconvincing argument. Supposing the child in question was<br>
ten years old. Or seven. Or five. He becomes attracted to his teacher,<br>
wants to spend time with her, takes her flowers, and as she becomes more<br>
responsive and physcial he, not knowing exactly what the hell is going on,<br>
sees his affection reciprocated and goes along with it. I happen to think<br>
that five year-olds should be protected from a world which can take such<br>
advantage of them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  They're both *magnificent* Americans.</i><br>
<p>
Why? What's 'magnificent' about them? They sound like pretty ordinary<br>
Americans to me, albeit one of them is, potentially, a criminal. (Or has<br>
she already been convicted?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Would an Extropian (or other </i><br>
<i>&gt;   free-society) curriculum exclude or prohibit 'sex education'?  I rather </i><br>
<i>&gt;   think not.</i><br>
<p>
I think not, also. Nor has anybody suggested it would.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Given the lack of </i><br>
<i>&gt;  internal and external metrics for human experience and preferences, </i><br>
<i>&gt;  most of us know better than to 'second-guess' the transactional choices </i><br>
<i>&gt;  people make between themselves.</i><br>
<p>
The point in this case is 'choice', and whether or not children are capable<br>
of making certain informed choices. And in this we base an awful lot of our<br>
raising of children on our belief that they cannot make certain choices.<br>
So, we don't leave paint-stripper on baby's little table; we apply a<br>
blanket "don't talk to strangers rule" rather than trusting the child's<br>
character judgement; etc. We make informed decisions about the<br>
choice-making capabilities of our children, for their protection.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Are you saying you would seek to _coercively prevent_ competent </i><br>
<i>&gt;   youngsters from seeking out and obtaining 'sex education'?</i><br>
<p>
Nobody has said anything like this, Tony. I haven't seen 'sex education'<br>
mentioned once before this post. Unless you're arguing that this affair was<br>
merely a sex education practical?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Is it any of your business. in fact?</i><br>
<p>
I would say it is the business of the child's parents, in their continuing<br>
role as protectors of that child until he reaches such an age as to be<br>
well-informed and competent in matters of physicality. And in so protecting<br>
him, they do not need to resort to their own vigilante means of prevention,<br>
since they have the law to do that for them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Do you believe 'we' can arbitrarily declare love to </i><br>
<i>&gt;   be some sort of 'crime'?</i><br>
<p>
No. Sex with a minor, on the other hand, can be declared a crime, with a<br>
non-arbitrary basis in at least several hundred years of Western cultural<br>
development.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   "Yes" or "No" will do.</i><br>
<p>
No, they won't. You are phrasing your arguments in misleading ways, drawn<br>
from false interpretations of previous statements. A "yes" or "no" to that<br>
is a choice made against options you provide, rather than a sound exegesis<br>
of the arguments to be presented.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The problem is, of course, that certain children are more capable of taking<br>
decisions at an earlier age than other children. However, the<br>
practicalities of the law mean that it must assign one single age to the<br>
meeting of sexual majority. This does not seem unreasonable. If there is<br>
any argument to be put, it must be that this age is too high (as I believe<br>
it is, at 18, for homosexuals in the UK). Personally, given the current<br>
social milieu of the West, I think 16 is about right (and given the state<br>
of the law it would seem the majority agree with me), but I'd listen to the<br>
arguments with interest, especially since a cross-cultural analysis would<br>
show the age of sexual maturity to differ globally.<br>
<p>
What I won't listen to is nonsense about people having suggested that sex<br>
education be banned, or that love be legally controlled, etc. in an attempt<br>
to win arguments which are almost, if not entirely, completely unrelated.<br>
