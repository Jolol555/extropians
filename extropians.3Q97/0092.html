<i>        &gt;transference is more daunting than either the problem of AI</i><br>

Not so, it will be much easier.<br>

<i>        &gt;your transferred self will be an AI  </i><br>

An Upload is not an AI, it would certainly be intelligent but the way it is <br>
organized would not be artificial, it will be copied from nature.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;we would need to understand the brain   </i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
Why? You can upload or download a program and have absolutely no idea how it <br>
works, the program doesn't care, it still does what it does.  I can see why <br>
in general we'd need to understand how neurons work, and in the particular <br>
brain to upload we'd need to know the strength of the 10^14  synapses that <br>
connect the 10^11 neurons in it, but I don't see why we 'd need to understand <br>
how the brain as a whole works to upload it.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;both of which are necessary *but not sufficient*       </i><br>

<p>
Not only is it sufficient it's far more than necessary. <br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;to effect transference, which much include a sense of continuity of         </i><br>

<p>
<p>
In other words it must have a good memory.<br>
                        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Uploading  has computer geeky, science-fictiony connotations.  </i><br>
                        <br>
<p>
I look on it as truth in advertising, Uploading is geeky and it does have <br>
science fiction connotations, religious ones too.<br>
                        <br>
<p>
<i>         &gt;Transference connotes better with a "philosophy of transhumanism."</i><br>
<i>         &gt;What do other list members think?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'm the wrong person to ask, I'm not very good at euphemisms.  <br>

<p>
We don't need to understand qualia to do that, we can do it today with <br>
artificial reality. Your consciousness is where your senses are and to a  <br>
lesser degree where your hand is, the position of your brain doesn't matter <br>
provided it's no so far away that you have signal delay problems.<br>
