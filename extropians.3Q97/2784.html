Although several people have expressed disagreement with this, I think<br>
Nicholas has a point.<br>
<p>
In particular, the doctrine of comparative advantage doesn't seem<br>
relevant.  You aren't going to lose access to the resources represented<br>
by the competition; rather, you are going to subsume those resources<br>
and gain greater control over them.<br>
<p>
It is misleading to draw an analogy with the traditional question of<br>
whether it is better to make someone into a slave or to trade freely<br>
with them.  Generally in that case it is better to trade, since they will<br>
be more motivated to excel when they can benefit by their own efforts.<br>
Unless very closely supervised, slaves tend not to be hard workers.<br>
<p>
However in the context of a nanotech takeover, the balance would be<br>
different.  Nanotech slavery can be perfectly effective.  In fact, it<br>
would be more useful to think of the conquered resources as now being an<br>
extension of the will of the conquerer, rather than slaves.  In fact the<br>
destruction may have involved gray-goo meltdown or nuclear fire, in which<br>
case the intelligences in the conquered region are built from scratch.<br>
<p>
It may be that a super-mind does find it convenient or necessary to give<br>
its sub-parts a certain amount of autonomy, similar to Minsky's model<br>
of our minds as a society of interacting subsystems.  There could still<br>
be disagreement or conflict among the parts as to the best division of<br>
resources, just as we in our own minds sometimes have trouble making<br>
choices between conflicting possibilities.  This would be the closest<br>
one would typically see to a "slave rebellion" in a nanotech era.<br>
<p>
The only real objection I can see to this is that the takeover process will<br>
involve some destruction.  This could mean the permanent loss of useful<br>
information, and it could also delay the time when the new resources can<br>
be fully exploited.  The alternative of mutually beneficial trade could<br>
allow faster conversion to nanotech (since there is no time wasted in<br>
warfare) and would retain more information.<br>
<p>
However these may not be very significant factors, particularly if<br>
the conquering power has a strong technological advantage over the<br>
competition.  The loss of information may be trivial compared to that<br>
generated by a few hours of nanotech crunching, and conquest may be the<br>
fastest method to convert the new region entirely to nanotech.<br>
