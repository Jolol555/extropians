 CurtAdams@aol.com responded:<br>
<i> &gt;With humans, probably very *sub*optimal. A critical part of optimizing human</i><br>

<p>
So maybe we should select on high emotional intelligence also? And improve<br>
communicative abilities and such.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;We do not differ markedly from 35,000-year-ago human</i><br>
<i> &gt;physically or in innate IQ but our society is vastly more productive, from</i><br>
<i> &gt;being set up differently.  </i><br>
<p>
Precisely. We have not changed, maybe we're missing out on a lot of<br>
growth-potential. We have not tried strong selection on traits like IQ.<br>
Not that I think we should, but it's an interesting thought-experiment.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The society you describe would greatly curtail the</i><br>
<i> &gt;possibilities for friendly, cooperative interaction between humans and hence</i><br>
<i> &gt;likely be far less productive than the current one.</i><br>
<p>
Why?, it's not like our current society has no blood on it's hands. We<br>
allow preventable deaths and sleep very well in spite of it. <br>
Of course the deaths would be closer to home for us<br>
rich-folks-in-rich-country's<br>
and that might be a bit nasty (the little boy next-door failing his IQ-test<br>
and such...). But I don't see why 'friendly, cooperative interaction'<br>
between the surviving individuals would be far less.<br>
<p>
Both nazi-germany and stalinist-russi performed great engineering and<br>
scientific feats in spite of their totalitarian nature.<br>
<p>
In response to the post from Joost de Lijser &lt;gd33463@glo.be&gt; I want to<br>
make absoluty clear that I do not, repeat NOT, advocate this (my<br>
enthousiasm in defending the idea just now scared me a bit in fact ;-). But<br>
for increasing the standard-of-living (not the same as quality-of-life) of<br>
highly intelligent, hardworking, highly educated, humans I think it's<br>
workable and efficient. For the other 95%; tough luck.<br>
<p>
I originally responded to this thread to emphasize the dangers of to much<br>
trust in free market systems as the 'natural' and thus the best system.<br>
There are some really rough edges to totally free market system.<br>
<p>
I won't get into the discussion about 'how much governement is good'. I<br>
think many members of this list are against almost any form of governement,<br>
and they problably have good reasons.<br>
My opinion is formed by my upbringing and what I see around me in the tiny<br>
speck called Holland. Free medical care and education, almost guaranteed<br>
housing and a basic income under any condition. No-one dies of starvation<br>
or for lack of basic medicine. Sure tax is high, but I think it's worth it<br>
(think of it as insurance).<br>
I work for IBM, we're in the business of replacing humans by machines.<br>
Sometimes this bothers me a bit, silly me.<br>
<p>
OK, my point is hopefulyl clear and this is not a political list so I'll<br>
leave it at this.<br>
<p>
about one minute ago I got the 'Free-Markets: Extro-Nazi's or<br>
Extro-Saints?' from Holly Pearson and I'm suspecting all hell to break lose.<br>
Let's not do a two-camp yes/no trench war. It was tried in 1915 without<br>
much succes.<br>
<p>
Donning my cyberhelmet... ;-)<br>
