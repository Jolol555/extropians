I can see that people would want to signal their mental abilities via<br>
conversation. I can also see that people might want to display their<br>
ability to persuade the tribe to take some action they favor.  But as<br>
you note, we don't understand why this would require people to<br>
strongly identify with particular views.<br>

<p>
For example, in academic discourse people typically speak about the<br>
strengths and weaknesses of particular views, and less often say "I<br>
believe", even when they do.<br>
