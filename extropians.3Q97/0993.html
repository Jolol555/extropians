Yes, that was a SciAm article, but the linguistic similarities were to<br>
Athabascan languages, which are a group of Amerind languages in North America<br>
separate from the main group and due to an invasion of related peoples across<br>
the Bering strait or landbridge significant after that which created the main<br>
group of Amerind cultures.  I think there were two isolated Siberian<br>
languages related to them as well.  I remember these details because I was so<br>
struck that they found the relatives of the Basques (which had been a mystery<br>
for centuries) and even more struck by who the relatives turned out to be.<br>
 Small world, indeed.<br>
