	that would be fine, arjen, but the fact of the matter is that<br>
	all the cases that WaxYack or whatever his name is mentioned<br>
	-- ruby ridge, waco, gordon kahl (i am quite familiar with all<br>
	the above), as well as many he didn't mention -- move being the<br>
	one that comes to mind firt  ... were all US Gov't "show cases".<br>
<p>
	the fact of the matter is, none of the above incidents were<br>
	precipitated by violence on the part of those which eventually<br>
	got immolated.<br>
<p>
	your suggestion that "if americans got rid of their guns the<br>
	gov't would have no reason to crack down on gun owners" is<br>
	tantamount to saying that "if uppity women don't insist on their<br>
	right to vote than the gov't won't have to crack the heads of<br>
	suffragettes."<br>
<p>
	a way to end violence, perhaps, but in no way a solution.<br>
<p>
	i respect that the dutch don't own personal firearms.  i'm<br>
	glad that it works for you.  i wager to guess that there are<br>
	a large number of other differences between your country and<br>
	the USA.  i suspect that looking at those differences will<br>
	give you an idea of the REAL causes of crime, and why the USA<br>
	suffers so much.<br>
<p>
	but, a quick look at the statistics governing all kinds of crime,<br>
	in all sectors of the american populace will show you, <br>
	IMH (extropian) Opinion, things are getting better!<br>
