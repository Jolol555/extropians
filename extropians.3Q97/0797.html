<i>&gt;      rapid re organization of consciousness into a kind of extreme inner </i><br>
<i>&gt;      subjectivity?</i><br>
<p>
I think nobody knows yet. But my bet is on a reorganization of<br>
consciousness == brain activity patterns. Maybe a self-supporting<br>
mental pattern is set up, and it becomes "real" to the experiencer (a<br>
bit like how novel characters can start to act against their author). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It has been documented that children experience this more than</i><br>
<i>&gt; adults. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, it is intriguing. One theory I have is that the child perceptual<br>
system is not yet fully developed, and at first just contains the<br>
"basics" of perception with comparatively little interpretation and<br>
further processing. This means a lot of computational resources are<br>
free, and can sustain eidetic imagery. As the children grow up,<br>
neurons get recruited into cellular assemblies coding for<br>
interpretation, experiences and interconnections, and the eidetic<br>
imagery gets lost due to interference from our higher level systems. <br>
We don't see the world as we did as children, we see a lot of<br>
concepts.  This might also explain idiot savants - they lack many of<br>
the interfering (but normally very useful) higher level systems, and<br>
their minds can devote themselves to single tasks.<br>

<i>&gt;      Anti Matter:</i><br>
<i>&gt;      </i><br>
<i>&gt;      I once heard some science show say that the energy yield from a </i><br>
<i>&gt;      theoretical anti matter engine would get us to Pluto in nine </i><br>
<i>&gt;      minutes...I more recently heard that a wee chunk of it has been </i><br>
<i>&gt;      manufactured and am curious as to what's to be done with it. </i><br>
<p>
Rather 9 days or weeks (see Robert Forward's publications in the<br>
field). The important problem is of course to manufacture enough for<br>
use as fuel - at CERN they just created nine antihydrogen atoms,<br>
which is obviously insignificant. I have some papers found on the net<br>
at <a href="http://antimatter.phys.psu.edu/:">http://antimatter.phys.psu.edu/:</a><br>
<p>
Antiproton-Catalyzed Microfission/Fusion Propulsion Systems for<br>
Exploration of the Outer Solar System and Beyond, by R.A. Lewis et al<br>
<p>
Productionand Trapping of Antimatter for Space Propulsion<br>
Applications, by Holzscheiter et al. <br>
<p>
The first paper suggests that 10-1000 nanograms of antimatter might<br>
be enough to use for catalyzed microfusion/fission. The second<br>
discusses how to gather this amount and store it. <br>
