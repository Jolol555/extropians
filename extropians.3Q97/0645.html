<p>
People say that 25% accuracy is a crappy result. BS. Considering that<br>
infantry shoots an average of 9000 rounds to kill one enemy soldier,<br>
artillery tosses an average of 50 rounds to nail one tank, etc....a<br>
25-50% success rate is highly surgical by military standards.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; As I recall, lookdown shootdown radar was not developed till the 80's,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and the computing power to clean out the gound noise to spot a guy at 90</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; feet was decades away. The soviets did not have this capability till the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; late 80's with their Mig-31.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe the soviets didn't, but Lockheed demonstrated it with the YF12 in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the sixties. They could cruise along at Mach 3 at 70,000 feet and kill</i><br>
<i>&gt; target drones flying at ninety feet. That the Air Force chose not to</i><br>
<i>&gt; continue developing the technology probably has more to do with politics</i><br>
<i>&gt; than engineering (i.e. they're not going to develop technology which</i><br>
<i>&gt; makes the F111 obsolete).</i><br>
<p>
I'd like to find out more on this radar. This is the first I've heard of<br>
it. I'd also like to see the cost projections. There is more to combat<br>
than whose got a better plane, but whose got a better, cheaper plane. A<br>
study was done by Northrup showing that 2.5 F-5s could outfly an F-15,<br>
and since 2.5 F-5's were somehting like 60% of the cost of an F-15, they<br>
reasoned that the F-5 was a better buy. THis is why so many developing<br>
nations bought F-5s in the 70s and 80s.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Also, outside of losses in Vietnam, F-111's lost less than 10% attrition</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; over 20 years. WHile I was stationed in NM, we lost one plane (out of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; over 60), and that was a hydraulic failure, not a TFR failure. The TFR</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; has a failsafe where it puts the plane into a steep climb out if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; malfunctions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Didn't work very well in England. Presumably it wasn't well tested for</i><br>
<i>&gt; European terrain (from what I remember of my one brief visit New Mexico</i><br>
<i>&gt; was mostly flat with the odd mountain) ?</i><br>
<p>
Eastern NM was quite flat, but central and northern NM is quite hilly<br>
and mountainous, far in excess of Britain or Germany. Additionally, the<br>
high quantities of private guns was another concern. Many farmers hate<br>
the Ardvaaark because it scares the shit out of their cows and dumps<br>
fuel on their pastures, which poisons the cows, so they tend to shoot at<br>
the F-111 rather frequently. Repairing bullet holes in the belly of the<br>
F-111 was one of the more frequent jobs that the sheetmetal boys had at<br>
Cannon.<br>
<p>
What seems like easy rolling hills at higways speeds is really rough<br>
terrain at 450 knots. Also, don't forget that NM terrain is on an<br>
entirely different scale than England. That hill you think is a quarter<br>
mile aways is actually a mountain a couple miles away.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That happens to consistently win awards at Red Flag bombing exercises.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Doesn't matter if it can be shot down before it gets there.</i><br>
<p>
True, thats why the EF-111 was developed. Its great as a mission escort.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; proportionately, that there is a high wing loading, and the swing wings,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that are automatically positioned based on the planes kinetic energy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; level, its adversary can automatically see which planes are in weak</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; positions at which points in a dogfight by the position of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; swingwing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Interesting, I hadn't thought of that. I wonder if it works in Strike</i><br>
<i>&gt; Commander... could do with some help against those damn Tornados.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I haven't played that game, so I'm not sure if its sophisticated enough<br>
to show that.<br>
