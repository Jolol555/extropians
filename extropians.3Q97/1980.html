I'm obviously no linguistics professor, but here's my view, anyway:<br>
<p>
It doesn't necessarily have to understand real world concepts...  Just<br>
accurately matching words with pre-written programs and objects is more<br>
than enough.  For example, NLP already works quite well for Internet<br>
searches, because it's able to tell the difference between a proposed law,<br>
an invoice and a visor of a cap.  That is, a bill, a bill and a bill.  It<br>
may not genuinely know or understand what these are, but it can still do a<br>
pretty good job associating the words with prewritten HTML documents.<br>
<p>
Getting the gist of what I'm trying to do, performing context-sensitive<br>
searching and loading up pre-designed programs is still a big step forward<br>
from the GUI, even if it falls way way short of AI.<br>

<i>&gt;about AI is I can tell my computer to do something no programmer ever dreamed</i><br>
<i>&gt;of, that will be the true computer revolution!</i><br>
<p>
There's no doubt about that!  Nonetheless, just understanding "Send this<br>
year's sales report to my boss," loading up the database, compiling the<br>
report, and mailing it off to my boss's e-mail address would be a<br>
significant breakthrough compared to Office 97, IMHO.<br>
