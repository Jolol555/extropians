Drawing from the initial part of Joao's post, it seems (IMH<br>
non-scientific O) that given damage to the brain via aging, cryo-freeze,<br>
or otherwise, we would be hard-pressed to put you back together with the<br>
same identity.<br>
<p>
I tend to lean towards a holistic neuron arrangement explaination. If<br>
the arrangment of neurons in your brain defines your identity, it is<br>
only because each and every neuron is in a particular place, which, as a<br>
consequence, births something more than the sum of the physical<br>
components (a particular identity). That is, a squishy mess of neurons<br>
put together based upon an incomplete picture of the *entire*<br>
arrangement would not yield anything more than a squishy mess of<br>
neurons. Reductionist study of the brain may be helpful to understand<br>
biology, but I would hazard that it is insufficient to understand<br>
something so complex (and unfortunately, abstract) as identity. <br>
<p>
This is not to say that our understanding of the brain will never reach<br>
the point where we can "fudge" things a little. But, one neuron<br>
incorrectly arranged may have little effect on identity -- say one step<br>
on the identity continuum. Two neurons incorrectly arranged -- two<br>
steps. Would three neurons incorrectly arranged have only a three-step<br>
effect? Or would it be four steps? Or six? What about four neurons? An<br>
exponential, geometric or one-to-one effect on identity? How many steps<br>
are on the indentity continuum to begin with? I don't know, but from my<br>
holistic perspective, I would argue that the effect on identity is<br>
*likely* to be greater than the neuron-position-based amount of<br>
incorrectness in the arrangement. <br>
<p>
At what point to you cease to be "you?" When the number of incorrectly<br>
arranged neurons sets you back more than 50% on the identity continuum.<br>
You're less you than not-you.<br>
