<i>&gt;To elaborate, people want political issues which are closely aligned</i><br>
<i>&gt;with aspects of their own values that they want to signal to others,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and which do not overly threaten how things actually get done.</i><br>
<p>
I think I was thinking about situations where the the values being<br>
expressed have mostly to do with argument itself--being interested in it<br>
and willing to do it, but neither too agreeable nor too argumentative.<br>
In other words, situations where the subject matter is neither<br>
practical nor value-advertising, but mainly a kind of neutral fodder<br>
for an activity that has another purpose.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Your desire to argue is also a social signal</i><br>
<p>
Right.  But the social signal may be mainly about desire to argue!<br>
In other words, sometimes that signal is just straightforward and<br>
practical, in the sense that it starts an argument that you wanted<br>
to get started.<br>
<p>
What I'm saying is that there are other purposes for non-practical<br>
conversation besides value and belief advertisement.  This is straying<br>
a little from your topic, but there are things in common between<br>
different kinds of non-practical communication.  For instance,<br>
the steering toward Grand Issues that the conversants aren't likely<br>
to affect.<br>
