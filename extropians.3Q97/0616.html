There's a Neal Stephenson's short story, "Jipi and the Paranoid Chip"<br>
in the 970707 Forbes magazine: <br>
<p>
Jipi goes to work for Mindshare Management as an online Guest Comfort<br>
Facilitator at the Manila Hotel. Her boss Mr.Cardoza tells her, "It's<br>
a vast field of opportunity ... A young woman with a nice personality<br>
need never be out of work."<br>
<p>
So, Jipi gets promoted to working with renegade paranoid schizophrenic<br>
car-alarm systems that have been evolved by Lamarck Logic, carrying on<br>
a fascinating dialog with one such device, trying to convince it that<br>
she's neither a spoofer or lurker and that its goal in 'life' is to<br>
learn to 'do the right thing' on its own.<br>
<p>
Stephenson masterfully turns this into a sort-of reverse Turing test<br>
as Jipi tries to convince the machine that "the conditions under which<br>
your ancestors were punished and rewarded no longer exist." The<br>
machine ponders: "Then it would follow that for me to exceed the<br>
performance of my ancestors I would have to cease participation in the<br>
reward/punishment structure."  Bzzt - wrong answer!<br>
