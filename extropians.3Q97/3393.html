Ok, so what I've never quite understood is this: why does the extreme<br>
curvature of space-time at the event horizon of a small black whole tear<br>
the intrepid astronaut to bits? More importantly, here's why I don't<br>
understand it.<br>
<p>
When space-time distorts why do the objects around feel the effects of that<br>
distortion as forces acting on their undistorted state? An analogy: take a<br>
latex sheet (I know you all have them at home, you can't fool me) and mark<br>
it with a grid for reference purposes. Now, fasten the edges of the sheet<br>
to a frame, place  weight on it and watch it distort. Throw a coin on to<br>
the sheet. You can still use the reference grid to identify the position of<br>
the coin: it moves with the sheet, acting rather like a point. Now throw<br>
another coin on. As the distortion of the sheet changes they will move<br>
closer and further apart in your frame of reference, but in terms of the<br>
grid on the sheet they will remain the same distance apart. And this is the<br>
point. When space-time distorts, as I understand it, 'new' space-time is<br>
not created, existing space-time merely stretches. But it stretches only in<br>
the context of an external point of view. Anything within that space-time<br>
would not see the stretching; a meter could become a kilometer from an<br>
external perspective, but within that area of space-time the meter would<br>
remain a meter. So where does the force in a black-hole come from. It's<br>
perfectly understandable in terms of gravitational field theory, but I lose<br>
it when space-time distortion is used to explain it. It seems to me that<br>
space-time and the object are not separate, as the one distorts, so does<br>
the other, each of its points remaining in the same relative position to<br>
all its other points.<br>
<p>
Or does space-time distortion cause the creation of 'new' space-time?<br>
