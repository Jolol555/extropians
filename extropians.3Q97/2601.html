<i>&gt; &gt; if nanotech is developed, it will first be fairly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; limited and mainly used in labs by people in white coats. Then its products</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will be marketed and sold, and eventually every home will have its own</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; assembler-tank.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Without a 100% reliable *global* immune system that will be </i><br>
<i>&gt; equivalent to giving everyone access to the launch buttons for the </i><br>
<i>&gt; world's total nuclear arsenal, as Eliezer said. Collective suicide.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, way back in Engines, Drexler recommended that these be *limited*<br>
assemblers.  The kitchen "build anything machine" would be restricted to<br>
building items from a catalog.  New designs would be carefully reviewed<br>
before being added to the approved list.<br>
<p>
The biggest problem with this scheme seems to be preventing someone from<br>
getting access to unrestricted nanotech via some means.  Either they find<br>
a way to subvert their limited assembler, or they do it the old-fashioned<br>
way, via biotech or STMs or self-assembling chemicals, etc.  Or, more<br>
disturbingly, members of the original group which developed nanotech may<br>
have retained access to the technology in its most powerful form, "just in<br>
case".<br>
<p>
If there are several different groups pursuing the development of nanotech,<br>
then it would be even more likely that we would end up with many groups<br>
with access to full nanotech.  Sci-fi ideas like having the first nanotech<br>
group create a plague which seeks out and destroys all the other research<br>
don't seem plausible.<br>
<p>
So in this scenario there are a few groups with full nanotech, which<br>
hopefully they use responsibly (or not at all).  Everybody else has<br>
access to limited assemblers, which create the kinds of improved products<br>
we associate with nanotech, but don't let them destroy the world.<br>
