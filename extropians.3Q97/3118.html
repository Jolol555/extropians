In a message dated 97-09-06 05:53:12 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Perhaps that's already happened, perhaps you died yesterday and entered<br>
the <br>
 realm of total oblivion, perhaps you're not conscious, perhaps you just<br>
think <br>
 you are. If I were to somehow prove to you that that's exactly what happened<br>
<p>
 can you think of any reason you should be the slightest bit upset about it? <br>
 I can't.                                          <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
The universe came into existence with my birth....it exists to amuse me...and<br>
will dissolve with my "Death".<br>
<p>
Isn't there a wacko philosphy or something that actually thinks along those<br>
lines?<br>
<p>
Course....it'd be hard to refute that logic...cause you're just a figment of<br>
my imagination.<br>
