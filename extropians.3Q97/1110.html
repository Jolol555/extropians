     Confusion? Most humans doesn't seem to have any real grasp of what is <br>
     going on, or feel they can't effect it.<br>

     <br>
     I was going to pipe in with apathy but I think confusion probably <br>
     leads to apathy because if somethinig is too confounding you just shut <br>
     down.  For instance, my confusion with how a culture that has a <br>
     majority of people subscribing to Judeo-Christian principles (and I <br>
     reference that only because those who subscribe are supposed to be <br>
     walking the Jesus walk...which is not anything like Church Lady's <br>
     Superiority Dance &lt;G&gt;) and enabled with so much prosperity and <br>
     technology can't come up with infrastructures to handle <br>
     disenfranchisement of an increasing number of stray humans.  After <br>
     moving to SF, I initially carried a roll of quarters to dole out.  It <br>
     didn't take long for me to stiffen my gaze straight ahead as I passed <br>
     by the shaking paper cup of the drifter or the disoriented mumblings <br>
     of the crack head or otherwise mentally ill derilect.  I started out <br>
     not understanding how there could be so many.  Not figuring it out and <br>
     not deciding to make it my life quest, I am presently choosing apathy. <br>
     I still don't understand.  I have rationalized my stand because I have <br>
     classified many of them (not including the mentally ill although they <br>
     implicitly qualify) as non-contributors.  <br>
     <br>
     I say that if you want to be a participant in a culture, you should be <br>
     contributing to it, adding value.  Although I acknowledge that the <br>
     homeless person "adds value" to my life by getting me to pause for <br>
     introspection, it's somehow "not enough".<br>
     <br>
     Thoughts on this?<br>
     <br>
