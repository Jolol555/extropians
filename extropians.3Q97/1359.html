<i>&gt; Well, it is all very absurd, but it's also true. Suppose the two slits are</i><br>

<i>&gt; other. One year after they encounter the slits they fall on your film, there</i><br>
<i>&gt; is no interference pattern and it's clear that each photon went through ONE</i><br>
<i>&gt; and only one slit a year ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now suppose that after traveling for one year after their encounter with the </i><br>
<i>&gt; slits and one second before they hit the film you suddenly decide to hold up  </i><br>
<i>&gt; a polarizer set to 45 degrees. This erases from the universe all information  </i><br>
<i>&gt; on what photon went through what slit and so you see an interference pattern</i><br>
<i>&gt; and it's clear that each photon went through BOTH slits a year ago.</i><br>
<p>
The way I would interpret this is to say that the photons always go<br>
through both slits.  Then, depending on the experimental setup, you can<br>
entangle them with the universe such that coherence is lost, or you can<br>
do it such that they remain coherent and interference can be observed.<br>
This really happens at the point where they hit the detectors (or perform<br>
some other irreversible operation), not before.<br>
<p>
It's wrong to say that the photon went through one slit, even if you<br>
put your eye up to it and *see* it go through.  The photon went through<br>
both slits.  However, you entangled yourself (and hence the rest of the<br>
universe with which you can interact) with the photon state such that<br>
you were not able to see the consequences of the photon going through<br>
both slits.  Coherence is lost and the two possible paths can no longer<br>
interfere.  Effectivelly you have split yourself into two states which<br>
can not interact, each of which sees the photon take a different path.<br>

<i>&gt;         &gt;Surely any old physical "macro" event, any computer (quantum or not)</i><br>

<i>&gt;         &gt;traveling up the optic nerve or a rod or cone neuronn in the retina</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;firring... can do just as much to "collapse" a wave as phenomenal</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;conscious representations can.</i><br>
<p>
I agree (mostly).  There are many studies showing how this kind<br>
of environmental interaction transforms the state from a quantum<br>
superposition to a classical mixture.  That is, interference between the<br>
different branches is no longer possible.  The exception is the quantum<br>
computer, which is specially constructed in order to preserve the full<br>
state information, and allow quantum interference effects to occur.<br>
