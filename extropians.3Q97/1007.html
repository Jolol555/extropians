Danny, the continental plates may only cover 80% of the earth's area<br>
(which I doubt), but the rest is taken up by the pacific and indian<br>
ocean plates which are subducting under the North American, SOuth<br>
American, Australian, and Asian plates. If what you suggest is true,<br>
then we would have a much greater meteoric impact record than we do and<br>
be living under much greater greenhouse conditions. Thus only the<br>
continental plates have grown as divergence continued, but those growing<br>
plates rode over older plates that subducted under them.<br>
<p>
20% of the earth's surface covers a volumebelow it in a cone shape to<br>
the core of approximately 25 billion cubic miles. Given that Pangea  was<br>
in existence as late as a couple hundred million years ago, we would<br>
have to be seeing around 100 cubic miles of meteoric accretion to our<br>
planet EVERY YEAR to equate to a 20% increase in earth's surface area.<br>
As this is obviously not true, then the idea that our earth's surface is<br>
20% greater than in the time of Pangea is ludicrous. We would have to<br>
experience the equivalent of 10 Yucatan extinction asteroids every year.<br>
This obviously would have exterminated life...a long, long time ago.<br>
