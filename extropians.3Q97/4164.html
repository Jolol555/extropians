The disproof of astrology is that most if not all the predictions are<br>
demonstrably *incorrect* in almost every way.  <br>
<p>
How do I know this?  Because I have read a number of well-designed<br>
scientific (`falsifiable') tests of the predictions of various standard<br>
astrological systems, and the success rates all turn out to be absolutely<br>
what you'd expect if the predictions had been allocated at random rather<br>
than by birth-dates.<br>
<p>
danny, if you wish to learn more about this claim of mine, read the<br>
open-minded study by the late Hans Eysenck and his associate D. K. B. Nias,<br>
ASTROLOGY: SCIENCE OR SUPERSTITION.  It's available in Penquin paperback,<br>
or maybe from some other publisher in the USA.<br>
<p>
If you're not prepared to read this book, by one of the most notable<br>
statistically-oriented psychologists of the century, your own claims<br>
deserve to be treated as worthless.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Astrology is very old.  </i><br>
<p>
Exactly.  Its current forms - and of course, the various doctrines differ<br>
wildly, depending what culture's astrology you choose to look at - derive<br>
essentially unchanged from pre-scientific speculations developed by people<br>
who did not know the basic facts about the position, motion, composition or<br>
age of the solar system and the universe, and whose grasp of genetics and<br>
neuro-psychology was rudimentary.  Why do you think this is a statement *in<br>
favour of* the doctrine?!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;there's a tribe in africa (the</i><br>
<i>&gt;dogon tribe) who have known about the star sirius b (sirius a's companion,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the sirius constellation is what the pyramids of giza are aligned to)</i><br>
<i>&gt;thousands of years before we had the technology to discover it.</i><br>
<p>
This is an interesting claim, because it can be tested.  Still, even if it<br>
had turned out to be correct (which it didn't), what is the relevance to<br>
astrology?  It might conceivably be evidence that humans had been given a<br>
disconnected nugget of information by alien space travellers, or time<br>
travellers from the future, or a lost scientific civilisation, or through<br>
the use of strange psychic powers, or once had really good night vision in<br>
an environment without nocturnal optical pollution, but it has *zero*<br>
impact on astrology one way or the other. <br>
<p>
BTW, Sirius is not a constellation.  The bright component of the binary is,<br>
however, the brightest star in the constellation Canis Major. <br>
