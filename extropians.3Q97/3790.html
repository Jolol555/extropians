<i>&gt; The Libertarian principles depend on free will.  When people who have</i><br>
<i>&gt; free will but "not enough wisdom to use it" - such as children - become</i><br>
<i>&gt; involved, the Libertarian principles are either modified or abandoned</i><br>
<i>&gt; entirely, depending on the Libertarian.  When a substance such as crack</i><br>
<i>&gt; starts infecting the population, the Libertarian principles cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; provide a simple solution; they are up against a problem of a higher</i><br>
<i>&gt; order than the principles, one having the ability to modify the</i><br>
<i>&gt; postulates on which the principles depend.  Under the circumstances, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think that my response - that of obliterating drugs (but not users!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; without coercive force - is restrained, mild, and appropriate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Consider crack to be a hostile government equipped with mind control.</i><br>
<p>
If you propose a technological solution, why don't you solvee the<br>
problem more elegantly? Don't use your technology to eliminate the<br>
drug. Rather, use your technology to eliminate the "anti-libertarian"<br>
effects of the drug. Create a technology that permits an "addict"<br>
(physical or psychological) to instantly and painlessly break the<br>
addiction. This restores free choice.<br>
<p>
On a different thread, we've already discussed the fact that an uploaded<br>
intelligence (and several other types of intelligences) will have<br>
direct control of the motivation and pleasure-generating portions<br>
of their "minds". Thus, we'll have to solve the equivalent of the<br>
drug problem some time within the next 50 years anyway, and probably<br>
before we have the equivalent technology for current drugs.<br>
