No truer words could ever have been spoken!  (by Mother Theresa I mean!)<br>
<p>
<p>
How do we clean up our own back yards when people in our country refuse to<br>
see the mess!  "Things are pretty good!" I hear them say..  Corporate<br>
profits up finance profits up, yet our own standard of living seems to be<br>
in decline!  <br>
<p>
I'm sick of the implications that this is a "mystical" event!  <br>
<p>
In my own back yard.. I have found documents from the 1800's warning of<br>
these exact things happening!  Thomas Edison was speaking on this form of<br>
finance!  Henry Ford was also well aware of what was happening.  Church<br>
elders and Popes wrote lengthy articles and Encyclicals on the issues we<br>
were then heading into.<br>
<p>
Read the constitution of The Knights of Labor.  Available at most full<br>
depository libraries.. on Fiche.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, I believe few people will do this because we are so intense<br>
on promoting our own agenda's.<br>
Divide and conquers as Adam Smith used to say.<br>
<p>
What I believe is also unfortunate, is that, Mother Theresa was simply<br>
cleaning up the "waste" our financial system has created.  Someone has to<br>
be a victim in a debt based system of finance.  Better that those people<br>
exist in another country.  <br>
<p>
Until the causative agent is removed from our system of buying and<br>
selling.... we are doomed to a life of debt with the weaker being our<br>
victims.<br>
<p>
The present investigation of the IRS in the US is both the "tip of the<br>
iceberg" and a form of "smoke screen" that will serve to protect the<br>
Federal Reserve Board and probably lead to further consolidate it's power. <br>
<p>
Sorry I beat the Anti-Banker drum but I feel they are viewed as heroes when<br>
they are really our ages greatest villains<br>
<p>
Let Peace prevail<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; Peter Turlands idea sounds interesting, though I am reminded of</i><br>
<i>&gt; something the late Mother Theresa said to a friend of mine. Four years</i><br>
<i>&gt; ago he made an excursion to India as part of a pilgrimage to the Holy</i><br>
<i>&gt; land. There he approached the venerable old woman with the question of</i><br>
<i>&gt; what could he do to help her in her work. She told him to go home and</i><br>
<i>&gt; clean up his own backyard.</i><br>
