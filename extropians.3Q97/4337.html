Just because a lot of new people have joined the list since the<br>
last time we had a discussion of cypherpunk issues, there is a web<br>
archive of posts to the cypherpunks list available at<br>
<p>
	<a href="http://infinity.nus.sg/cypherpunks/">http://infinity.nus.sg/cypherpunks/</a><br>
<p>
I've been using this archive as my primary access to the mailing list <br>
(which can get very political and very tedious at times) for the last<br>
six months or so.  It's reliable, and fast enough that I don't get too<br>
impatient to use it.  I find it ironic that it's located in Singapore,<br>
but hey, more power to the sysadmin.  ;)<br>
<p>
If you just want to take a quick look, I recommend the analytical<br>
essays posted by Tim May.  He's quite the radical rabble-rouser,<br>
but a very sharp cookie who spends a lot of time thinking about<br>
the unfolding effects of computers, communications, and cryptographic<br>
technology upon society at large.<br>
<p>
He also wrote the hilarious satirical essay on Rapture of the Future<br>
which can be found in the proceedings of Extro-1.<br>
