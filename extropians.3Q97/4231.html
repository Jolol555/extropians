Its just a matter of what dwells in people's memories. Big adrenaline<br>
rushing disasters tend to be reinforced in the mind more than subtle,<br>
everyday killers, even though many more people are killed by everyday<br>
humdrum things than catastrophes. People look at the one bomb for<br>
Hiroshima and forget that many more people were killed in the<br>
firebombing of Dresden, and probably they died much more cruel deaths<br>
for the most part than the flash fried Hiroshimans. I doubt that more<br>
than 1 in ten Americans even know that Dresden is in Germany or what<br>
happened there, yet at least half if not more know what happened at<br>
Hiroshima and where it is, when and why. You don't see any worldwide<br>
protests and campaigns to ban conventional bombs, do you? Nor any laws<br>
about how much cholesterol and fat are allowed in foods, even though<br>
they kill more people than radiation or nicotine ever will.<br>
