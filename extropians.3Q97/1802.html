Subject: backlinks ready for testing<br>
<p>
To Senior Associates:<br>
<p>
Backlink software, the Crit Mediator, is now on the web and ready for <br>
your<br>
testing at:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://crit.org">http://crit.org</a><br>
<p>
Source code (by Ka-Ping Yee) is also posted.  Feel free to download it <br>
and<br>
use it at your server, but be aware that we do not currently have <br>
anyone<br>
available to help you with any tech support.<br>
<p>
We do not yet have a special test area as I write this, so until that <br>
is<br>
set up, be aware that you are making "real" backlinks that will be <br>
visible<br>
to others using the system, and they will be expecting actual content.<br>
<p>
This is currently running on one Pentium on a T1 line.  We expect <br>
(hope!)<br>
this to become overloaded, so if you run into performance delays, that <br>
is<br>
probably the problem.<br>
<p>
Everyone involved on this project is heavily overloaded, so we ask your<br>
patience in responding to (or even reading) the massive amount of email <br>
we<br>
expect to receive starting very soon.<br>
<p>
We urgently need additional funding to handle the work that this <br>
project is<br>
expected to attract.  If you can help, please contact me at<br>
peterson@foresight.org, or phone 415 917 1122, or just mail a check to:<br>
Foresight Institute, PO Box 61058, Palo Alto, CA 94306 USA.<br>
<p>
Eric, I, and everyone involved would like to thank the Senior <br>
Associates<br>
for making this project possible.<br>
