This is a good example of reasonable scientific theory being unjustifiably<br>
twisted and modified to fit the preconcieved fantasy of someone who can not<br>
tell the difference.<br>
<p>
Zero point field (also commonly referred to as Quantum Vacuum, or QV)<br>
theory is an interesting consequence of quantum mechanics, but is by no<br>
means a source of "free energy".  The zero point field is a pervasive and<br>
essentially uniform radiation field with a Lorentz invariant spectrum.<br>
Although, you can generate some interesting phenomena by manipulating this<br>
field (currently our ability to do so is extremely limited), these always<br>
seem to require adding energy to the system in some form or another.<br>
<p>
Zero point field theory has *nothing* to do with "another dimension" in the<br>
sense that you are most likely using it.  The only potentially interesting<br>
consequences that I am aware of is a possible explanation of inertial mass<br>
and the gravitational force (which would not be a fundamental force in this<br>
model).<br>
<p>
There are a few scientific and rigorous papers on the net regarding this,<br>
but I do not have the URLs.  On most search engines you'll have to wade<br>
through a ton of garbage to find something good.  "stochastic<br>
electrodynamics" or "Lorentz invariant" are probably a good key phrases to<br>
weed out most of the <br>
free-energy and UFO crowd.<br>
