"Han Y. Huang" &lt;hhuang@mit.edu&gt; proposed the usage of the word<br>
"transference".<br>
<p>
	I kind of like this idea also.<br>
<p>
	Another possibility I like to think about is the possibility<br>
of how the subjective experience of "transference" might be produced.<br>
<p>
	First off, I'm a representationalists, so I believe everything<br>
we are aware of is represented in our brain.  For me, there is a kind<br>
of 'spirit world' in our mind that is everything we consciously know<br>
via our senses.  We aren't really directly aware of the tree out there<br>
we are looking at, but merely a conscious model constructed of qualia<br>
(or spiritual stuff or whatever you want to call it) in our model of<br>
the world in our conscious mind.<br>
<p>
	At the center of this model of the world in our brain is the<br>
model or conscious precept of ourselves.  It feels like we are just<br>
behind our eyes.  This physical location must be due to the way this<br>
conscious model is produced in our brain in this conscious world of<br>
our awareness.<br>
<p>
	In some way the entire world of all our senses is unified into<br>
a single awareness.  Our sight, sound, tactile senses are all unified<br>
into a single spirit world of consciousness.  If we understand how to<br>
recreate such conscious worlds of awareness we will also understand<br>
how to expand these worlds of awareness.  For example, if we add eyes<br>
behind our head and the corresponding additional visual cortex, it<br>
would have to be integrated into and expand the world of our awareness<br>
we already have.  Our initial visual cortex would produce our<br>
awareness or model of what we see in front of us and the new one would<br>
add to this, the model of what we see behind us.  All in one unified<br>
awareness space.  Just as the data from both eyes produces one<br>
combined 3d model of awareness.  With eyes around our head our field<br>
of vision could be increased to be 360 degrees wide modeling<br>
everything around us in our consciousness.<br>
<p>
	Similarly we should be able to add yet another similarly<br>
integrated visual cortex that could be fed data produced by another's<br>
set of eyes.  Giving us direct awareness, in the same awareness space,<br>
of another entirely different point of view.<br>
<p>
	Anyway, what I'm leading up to is, I like to think about the<br>
possibility of synching up the conscious awareness model or spirit<br>
world of the platform we will be uploaded to with our own conscious<br>
awareness before uploading.  In other words it will all be one unified<br>
world of awareness.  It might be possible to architect it in such a<br>
way that our conscious model of ourselves actually migrates, or moves,<br>
or "transfers", within this unified conscious model of space, which<br>
included representations of the two old and new platforms within it<br>
and their sensual points of view.  Everything being universally aware<br>
to this combined consciousness in the same subjective space.<br>
<p>
	If we understand how to properly control qualia and build and<br>
expand conscious awareness worlds in this way, like our brain does<br>
with the data collected by our current multiple senses, we should be<br>
able to produce the experience of "moving" between hosts in any of<br>
many possible ways.  It could be made to feel like an "out of body"<br>
experience where our "soul" (the conscious representation of ourselves<br>
in this conscious space) leaves one body and floats to the new<br>
platform.  Or it could feel like our "self" was traversing down the<br>
physical connection as if it was a tube that was unifying the two<br>
conscious worlds into one combined awareness.<br>
<p>
	Anyway, these technical descriptions are probably way to brief<br>
but I hope at least some of you can get the idea.  Anyone have any<br>
other thoughts along these lines?<br>
