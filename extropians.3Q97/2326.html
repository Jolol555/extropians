In a message dated 97-08-21 10:16:22 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
<i> &gt; Saw this on CNN "Factoids":</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Six countries currently execute children (people</i><br>
<i> &gt; under the age of 18):</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Iran</i><br>
<i> &gt; Iraq</i><br>
<i> &gt; Bangladesh</i><br>
<i> &gt; Pakistan</i><br>
<i> &gt; Nigeria (?)</i><br>
<i> &gt; USA</i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
I wonder if this has anything to do with another subject I'm currently<br>
following...Since you mention that it comes from CNN rather than a credible<br>
source.....I suspect that it does.<br>
<p>
<p>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
The American Society of Newspaper Editors launched a project to<br>
learn why they are losing public trust. Some know that liberal<br>
bias is the problem, but more disparage that thought<br>
<p>
              +++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
<p>
 'Journalism Credibility Project'<br>
may be the industry's most serious effort at large-scale<br>
ombudsmanship. Over the next three years, the society will spend<br>
more than $1 million trying to find out why people don't love and<br>
trust newspapers anymore. <br>
<p>
<p>
 "The society's President, Sandra Mims Rowe, editor of The<br>
(Portland) Oregonian, became convinced of journalism's credibility<br>
problem 'because of negative poll after negative poll coming out'<br>
and 'the amount of negative press in the press about the press.'...<br>
    "During the project, the editors will do some predictable..........."<br>
<p>
          +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
<p>
<p>
Duh!<br>
<p>
Here's a guess on my part.....the USA was added to that list of countries <br>
 because the news media hates the US...<br>
<p>
Why does the news media hate the US?  Because it represents freedom and<br>
individual rights....by associating the US with countries which are opposed<br>
to that view the idea of individual rights and freedom is diminished.  And<br>
Statism gains ground....<br>
<p>
Now I don't hold strongly to this guess...it sounds too much like a<br>
conspiricy...and why invest in a conspiricy when pure ole stupidity will<br>
explain it just as well?  And the news media have demonstrated that in<br>
addittion to being lazy and liberal they are  very much stupid...as reading<br>
any science or technology (or anything that you can corroborate for that<br>
matter...i.e. trucking)  article in the general press  will demonstrate.<br>
<p>
The general public ain't buying it....it's backfiring...the newsmedia is<br>
loosing credibulity instead. Which is interesting to me since the news media<br>
lost all credibulity with me 20 or more years ago during the Veet-Naam war,<br>
and has never regained it.. Does that make prescient?<br>
<p>
Then again....when listing  the USA maybe they were referring to the 3million<br>
or so unborn children who are executed every year.?.....nawwwwwww..<br>
