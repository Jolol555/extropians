From: Brent Allsop &lt;allsop@swttools.fc.hp.com&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So anyway, let me ask you a question I've been struggling with</i><br>
<i>&gt;about what the proper behavior should be.  Lets say you have a</i><br>
<i>&gt;very close loved one.  Say it is one of your children or</i><br>
<i>&gt;something.  Lets say he's about 17 years old and you know that</i><br>
<i>&gt;throughout his life he has consistently expressed a desire to not</i><br>
<i>&gt;be cryonically preserved possibly because he is a totally</i><br>
<i>&gt;convinced member of some religion which is against it.  Let's call</i><br>
<i>&gt;him Jeff.  You figure Jeff hasn't really seriously considered</i><br>
<i>&gt;dieing or whether he would really want to be preserved because he</i><br>
<i>&gt;is so young even though he has several times explicitly said to</i><br>
<i>&gt;you he did not want to make any effort to be preserved.</i><br>
<p>
Jeff has made his wishes clear<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"Do we preserve him or don't we?"</i><br>
<p>
If you are a libertarian....... no.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What would you tell them to do?</i><br>
<p>
I would respect his wishes in this matter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I ask anyone that is a better moral expert than I, what should</i><br>
<i>&gt;I do?</i><br>
<p>
Morals are an individual matter, (therefore beyond experts) we are<br>
responsible for our actions, unless mentally disabled. You should<br>
do what you think best, but you should also take responsibility for<br>
your actions, and realize if revived, Jeff may chose to have<br>
nothing to do with you for ignoring his wishes. <br>
