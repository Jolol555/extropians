<i>&gt;Animals do not engage in aggression. Violence, yes. I believe that</i><br>
<i>&gt;attributing 'aggression' to animals is an instance of anthropomorphism,</i><br>
<i>&gt;roughly in the same category as Walt Disney cartoons featuring mice that</i><br>
<i>&gt;speak.</i><br>
<p>
By your definition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The choices are *moral* or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*amoral*. The decision that proportionate defense is moral, and aggression</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is immoral, is what defines 'moral'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;That isn't what defines 'moral'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;What defines 'moral' then?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Morals are "by agreement". If you agree that a particular</i><br>
<i>&gt;universally-applicable principle is a 'moral', then it is - for you and</i><br>
<i>&gt;everyone who agrees with you about that principle. "Universally-applicable"</i><br>
<i>&gt;means that you presume it applies to yourself and everyone else. Such</i><br>
<i>&gt;presumptions are, of course, rebuttable.</i><br>
<p>
I think we just said the same thing, with me using the word "decision" and<br>
you using the word "agreement." And at the end of this post you agreed that<br>
agreements come from decisions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The decision that defense is not just</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;something we do (amoral), but rather something that is right to do (moral),</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is the very basis of morality and rights.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;You should be more precise. Defense against aggression is moral. Defense</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;against rising floodwaters is amoral.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;OK, make that human defense against human aggression.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As far as I know, only humans engage in aggression.</i><br>
<p>
By your definition. How about when humans aggress against animals? Is that<br>
immoral?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It means making the primary ethical decision that proportionate defense</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;against aggression is moral and aggression is immoral. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh. What exactly distinguishes a 'primary' ethical decision from a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;'secondary' ethical decision?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The secondary is dependent upon the primary.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Is the primary decision dependent on anything?</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what you are asking here. If a decision is dependent on another<br>
decision, then it cannot be the primary decision.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Where does the *concept* of morality come from if not the primethic</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;decision?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Presumably, the concept arose originally from somebody's imagination.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;For what purpose?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Who knows? Maybe it just seemed like a good idea at the time.</i><br>
<p>
You're being evasive. Where does the concept of morality come from? For what<br>
purpose?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why, when we view a dispute between humans, do we</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;judge who is *right* and who is *wrong*? Do *all* people do this, or just</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;those who have made the primethic decision?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Beats me. Does it matter?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;If all people do this, then the primethic is not a decision, but a human</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;instinct.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are you suggesting that morals are instinctual?</i><br>
<p>
Possibly. The primethic does seem to be widespread. It's entirely possible<br>
that amorality vis a vis A/D could be learned behavior, with the primethic<br>
being instinctive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;defense against aggression is amoral...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It isn't, ever.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Because of the definition of 'aggression'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Only in your dictionary.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps, but my definition of 'aggression' is not much different from</i><br>
<i>&gt;common useage, and the dictionary definition works well in all but very odd</i><br>
<i>&gt;situations. Your definition of 'primethic' has more serious problems.</i><br>
<p>
Such as?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What real world phenomenon forms the basis of your definition?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Language. In my particular case: the english language.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;You're being evasive. Words describe things. Aggression is not limited to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;human interaction, nor does the word describe a moral judgement.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I disagree. In order to label something as 'aggression', it is necessary to</i><br>
<i>&gt;have already made a moral judgement of the 'aggressive' act in question.</i><br>
<i>&gt;'Aggression' is a morally-loaded word, and 'aggression' is _always_ a 'bad'</i><br>
<i>&gt;thing. I agree that the word is sometimes mis-used and applied to animals,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but I think that is simply a mistake - anthropomorphism. Similarly, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;word 'aggression' is sometimes mistakenly used to describe violence</i><br>
<i>&gt;employed in self-defence. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Consequently, I think it might be important to be rigorous about the</i><br>
<i>&gt;definition  of 'aggression', to avoid confusion and misunderstanding. I've</i><br>
<i>&gt;stipulated a definition for 'aggression' that makes sense to me and isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;too different from correct common-useage. If you prefer a different</i><br>
<i>&gt;definition, we can certainly look at different one.</i><br>
<p>
Virtually any statement can be made valid by simply changing a few<br>
definitions here and there. Be that as it may, even if your definitions were<br>
widely accepted, they prove nothing. Argument by definitions is nothing more<br>
than argument by assertion, substituting, "because the dictionary says so"<br>
for "because I say so."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Like all concepts, they come from the imagination - the mind. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;interesting question is, how do some things come to be deemed 'moral' and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;other things come to be deemed 'immoral' and many other things fall into</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;neither category and are therefore 'amoral'?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The primethic decision.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If the primethic is truly a decision, then some thought must go into the</i><br>
<i>&gt;decision-making process. What thoughts would be relevent? What factors</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be considered prior to making this "primethic decision"? Certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt;not any self-defense or survival issues, we've already agreed that those</i><br>
<i>&gt;are instinctual and instinctual responses require no thought at all. So...</i><br>
<i>&gt;What remains?</i><br>
<p>
The primethic may very well be instinctive, but I haven't thought of any way<br>
to prove it...yet. Not all survival tactics are instinctive. For those who<br>
are less successful at aggression, or prefer to sleep without one eye open,<br>
the primethic may present a means of peaceful coexistance with their<br>
neighbors. If many share in that decision, then all are safer.<br>
<p>
The fact that people feel that defense (against human aggression) *itself*<br>
is moral, and human aggression *itself* is immoral, as opposed to just<br>
aggression against oneself being immoral, would tend to indicate that the<br>
primethic may be instinctive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Where do your</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;definitions come from?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;My definitions come from the same place that all definitions come from:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;They are created by agreement. Which answers the previous interesting</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;question, I guess.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;And agreements come from decisions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Indeed they do... And decisions are made by a process of reasoning. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;question then becomes: what reasons might be relevent to enter into any</i><br>
<i>&gt;sort of agreements? Especially agreements that might be the basis of</i><br>
<i>&gt;something called: Morals?</i><br>
<p>
