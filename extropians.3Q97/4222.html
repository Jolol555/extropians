<i>&gt; (in reference to someone's use of "so-called 14th Amendment")</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; I have a semantics problem with this paragraph.  I understand</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; referring to the Constitution of the United States as the so-called</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Constitution, as a constitution is a document that governs the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; legal workings of an organization, and many people think that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; legal system often subverts and ignores the provisions of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; constitution in pursuit of their political projects.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; However, an amendment is simply something in a document that was</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; put in later through a process described in the original document.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is precisely the point at issue among those who dispute</i><br>
<i>&gt; the legality of the 14th amendment and the other Reconstruction</i><br>
<i>&gt; Amendments.  The process by which they were added to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Constitution is not the process described in the original</i><br>
<i>&gt; document, because the legal situation at the time (one half the</i><br>
<i>&gt; country having been conquered by the other half) was never</i><br>
<i>&gt; foreseen by the Constitution.</i><br>
<p>
The language could still be clearer.  I'd call it the "putative<br>
14th amendment" rather than the "so-called 14th amendment", because<br>
we don't question its inherent amendment-ness, only its legality.<br>
