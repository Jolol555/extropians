<i>&gt; `Negative feedback' is *not* primarily an economics term, but derives from</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems and control theory and has very general application.  It is at</i><br>
<i>&gt; least 50 years old, and is the basis of all advanced control systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps it is called something entirely different in your own language, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is defined in most English dictionaries.  I keep a dictionary on my</i><br>
<i>&gt; desk, and another on my kitchen table, and when I see a word I don't know I</i><br>
<i>&gt; look it up - I don't start by asking other people.  If it's not in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; dictionary, I look in the encyclopedia in my study, and if it's not there</i><br>
<i>&gt; *then* I have no hesitation in asking.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
To which I would add: perform an Alta Vista search on<br>
the term before asking a question of a live human. This<br>
is sometimes easier than standing up and walking all the<br>
way over to your dictionary. There are also dictionaries<br>
on the web, but the search can often be more helpful.<br>
Try "negative feedback". <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The term is regularly abused in the general English-speaking culture.  New</i><br>
<i>&gt; Age types, and many others, are always smiling gratefully when they receive</i><br>
<i>&gt; what they call `positive feedback' (meaning, for them, encouragement or</i><br>
<i>&gt; praise) and recoiling from the dreaded `negative reinforcement' (meaning,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they suppose, disapproval).  In fact, positive feedback is nothing more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than returning a part of the system's output in such a way that the output</i><br>
<i>&gt; *increases*, while negative feedback uses part of the system's current</i><br>
<i>&gt; output to *restrict* or *lower* continuing output. </i><br>
<p>
I had the pleasure of being in an auditorium in which<br>
a marketing type asked an audience of engineers for<br>
"positive feedback" just as he moved in front of the<br>
speaker while wearing a portable microphone. He got<br>
his positive feedback then, from the PA system. The<br>
Audience cracked up, laughing uproarously. The marketeer<br>
got a puzzled look on his face.<br>
<p>
Population growth, epidemics,  and our singularity scenarios<br>
are examples of positive feedback. The non-technical public<br>
just doesn't get it.<br>
