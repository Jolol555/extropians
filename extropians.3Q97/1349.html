Exactly. Tonight the Lawnmover Man will air on swedish television. I<br>
like the film, it contains several transhuman themes and the graphics<br>
from Xaos Inc was brilliant when it was made. Still, to tell the<br>
story the movie *needs* something gone wrong (at least they did not<br>
use the silly Star Trek idea that superintelligence always leads to<br>
amoralit - the nasty men in suits wrecked the whole experiment). <br>
<p>
Maybe one way of getting tension into a basically transhuman movie<br>
may be to have a conflict between two reasonable points of view,<br>
instead of "good guys vs. villains", like (say) transhumanists<br>
wishing to expand human potential and bring life to the universe, and<br>
environmentalists who want to heal the world and live in harmony with<br>
nauture (the movie could end with the transhumans moving off-planet<br>
as "Children of the Sun", leaving it for the "Children of the<br>
Earth"), but I think most companies would prefer the tried and tested<br>
black vs. white theme. <br>
<p>
Another way of showing transhuman themes in an interesting way is to<br>
look at their human consequences. What about a movie about a family<br>
where a daughter is uploaded after an accident, something like the<br>
typical movie where the daughter is handicapped and people struggle<br>
to adapt and understand the situation? <br>
