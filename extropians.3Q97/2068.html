<i>&gt;This message describes an amazing concept I came up with recently.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;haven't worked out all the details, but if it's true it would be very cool.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Remember that message I sent out a few weeks ago, about how you could build</i><br>
<i>&gt;a device that could hover indefinitely in the atmosphere of the Sun?  Well,</i><br>
<i>&gt;consider this: such devices could be made self-reproducing, so they could</i><br>
<i>&gt;cover much of the area of the Sun, and then used to extract raw materials</i><br>
<i>&gt;from the substance of the Sun.  </i><br>
..<br>
So the extraction machines at the surface can go on<br>
<i>&gt;for a long time before running out of stuff to process.  After a few hundred</i><br>
<i>&gt;thousand years, we will have extracted most of the helium-3 and nitrogen-15</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the swirly part of the Sun (the core of the Sun is non-swirly and doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;mix with the outside).  This will amount to a ball about the size of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Earth.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Assembling this mass into a ball presents a problem, as<br>
we talked about. Maybe consider injecting the mas into a <br>
low Sun orbit (LSO), then do the assembling into a sphere<br>
with a crust.<br>
Leaving it there in orbit, go out to the Oort cloud and gather <br>
up a roughly comparable mass of whatever. This can be accomplished<br>
with relativly little energy expenditure. This mass is now sent on a<br>
long-period cometary-style orbit which intersects the orbit of the<br>
fusion-primer sphere. With proper mass, timing and flyby distance (prograde,<br>
passing behind the sphere) the sphere's orbital velocity is nearly cancelled,<br>
allowing it to drop nearly straight in, as desired. The cometary mass<br>
takes up a Solar orbit of higher angular momentum.<br>
A variation on this is a combo shot: Drop the Oort cloud mass(es)<br>
on orbits intersecting the big moons of the gas giants, either putting <br>
them into periodic solar orbit or straight in.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How to get the bomb to the center of the Sun?  I suggest wrapping it in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;few thousand miles of inert, abundant stuff (say aluminum and silicon) and</i><br>
<i>&gt;then just dropping the whole ball in.</i><br>
<p>
 99% of the Sun's helium-3 was down below<br>
<i>&gt;the layer we could reach before.  Now it will be brought up to the surface,</i><br>
<i>&gt;where we can build the grandmother of all fusion bombs with it.  This one is</i><br>
<i>&gt;about the size of Uranus.  </i><br>
<p>
And do the same here. A good deal of He3 can be obtained from the <br>
gas giants, maybe enough to make this a one step procedure??<br>
