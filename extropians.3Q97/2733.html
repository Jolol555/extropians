(Fairly optimal.) In the sense that it would be *much* easier to <br>
build something on four wheels that moves by itself than it is to <br>
build a vehicle that can compete on the open market today. The <br>
context was this: Carl said that a simple self-replicator would <br>
contain about the same amount of information as a car. So some <br>
kind of analogy-inference might be made if we know how difficult is <br>
it to design a car. Well, how difficult is it? Many highly skilled <br>
people have been busy for many decades designing cars, so it seems <br>
very hard. But this would be to overlook the fact that the <br>
self-replicators we are trying to build need not be optimised in the <br>
sense that cars need to be, if they are to be acceptable to car <br>
designers. The relevant analogy (a weak one, to be sure) is rather to <br>
steerable automobiles on four wheels or something like that; not to <br>
car that could be sold today.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "The Recursive Universe" by William Poundstone.  It has a good layman's</i><br>
<i>&gt; description of Conway's proof, and some guesstimates of what it would take to</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually make a self-replicating Life computer (conclusion: no time soon).</i><br>
<p>
I don't have that book handy, but now I'm beginning to suspect that <br>
what Poundstond makes guesstimates about is constructing such a <br>
gadget in the real world. What we were talking about was Conway's <br>
universal Turing machine in the Life world (a mathematical model). <br>
I think Carl Feynman said that he was aquainted with Conway's proof <br>
and thought that going to the detailed design was only a matter of <br>
filling in some details. (Did you really think that I believed that <br>
somebody had built a Life world replicator in the real world out of <br>
cogwheels or whatever?)<br>
