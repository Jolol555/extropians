I see I should have read through all of today's arrivals before<br>
resending that.<br>

<i> &gt; Yes, I anticipated something like that happening.  Food, medical</i><br>
<i> &gt; supplies, certain consumer goods, and other things that change</i><br>
<i> &gt; hands quickly and rapidly are likely to become...</i><br>
<p>
<i> &gt; "Exchange nexuses."</i><br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Such items will probably become the 'units' by which the price of</i><br>
<i> &gt; something is explained.  Their existence will greatly simplify the</i><br>
<i> &gt; computational work of cyclic debt cancellation.</i><br>
<p>
Well, their existence will solve the "double coincidence of<br>
wants" requirement which plagues all pure barter systems.<br>
That's why money comes into existence spontaneously in every<br>
fluid barter system, and it's why I'm still unclear on why you<br>
want to "get rid of" money (as if such a thing were possible).<br>
<p>
Getting rid of government counterfeit is another thing<br>
altogether, and something I favor.  But that's just one<br>
particular (flawed) monetary system, not at all the same thing<br>
as money in general.  Money in general is just the most<br>
marketable good (or goods) in a given market.  It serves a<br>
valuable function as a communications medium.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; But it still isn't a monetary system.  </i><br>
<p>
I don't see why not.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Here's another way to look</i><br>
<i> &gt; at it:  Before the existence of commodities exchanges, grain got</i><br>
<i> &gt; dumped into the harbor.  </i><br>
<p>
Well, not exactly.  It depends on what you are willing to recognize<br>
as a commodities exchange.  Any ordinary street market where the<br>
traders trust one another well enough to extend credit to one<br>
another can function as a commodities exchange.  In this sense,<br>
commodities exchanges are probably as old as literacy.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Another benefit is that if everything is barter, maybe somebody</i><br>
<i> &gt; will take a look at the economy and say:  "Hey, these 5 hours a</i><br>
<i> &gt; day of paperwork aren't actually producing anything!"  But that's</i><br>
<i> &gt; the question of dispensing with the simplifying, information-losing,</i><br>
<i> &gt; stultifying abstractions called "corporations"... which will wait</i><br>
<i> &gt; for another day.  </i><br>
<p>
Five hours a day of paperwork is a chunk of computation going on<br>
in a distributed computational system called "the global economy".<br>
It produces new information, the value of which cannot be determined<br>
independently of the context in which the information is being<br>
produced.<br>
<p>
Corporations are just voluntary associations like clubs or sewing<br>
circles, except (usually) with a profitable business activity as<br>
the aim of the group.  I'm still not sure about the way personal<br>
liability of actors acting on behalf of the corporation seems to<br>
evaporate under legislation currently regulating most corporations,<br>
but I really don't see how or why one would want to get rid of<br>
them.  Avoid them, perhaps, but not get rid of them.  The economic<br>
theory of the firm is not something I've mastered yet.<br>
