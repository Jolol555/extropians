<i>&gt;&gt; I understand and agree with this: but what do you say to people who say</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I would say that, actually, it isn't an ethic at all but, very precisely,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a politic.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That's a cop-out: I think Galt's oath /is/ an ethic, and one of the most</i><br>
<i>&gt;beautiful sentences ever written in the language.  It expresses precisely</i><br>
<i>&gt;the ethic that "obligation" and "compassion" are not merely unrelated</i><br>
<i>&gt;but quite contradictory.  It is impossible to have true, effective,</i><br>
<i>&gt;compassion from a sense of obligation.  Compassion /requires/ freedom.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Compassion /must/ be voluntary.  Though it is not directly a positive</i><br>
<i>&gt;ethic (i.e., a "thou slalt" rather than "thou shalt not"), it does</i><br>
<i>&gt;express the root from which her positive ethics come: the love of life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I agree that it's extraordinarily beautiful, but it is *incomplete* as<br>
an ethic.  A wee while ago I was on a thread in humanities.philosophy.objectiv<br>
ism arguing in this very area; and there I proposed that there are:<br>
<p>
Rational self-interest and irrational self-interest.<br>
<p>
Rational other-interest and irrational other-interest.<br>
<p>
Rand was very good at damning the second and the fourth, but I don't<br>
think she even saw the possibility of the third.<br>
<p>
And actually, ethics is all about obligations one has in *both*<br>
directions, and the obligation is the same in both directions: one must<br>
be concerned about both self and other, in the sense of doing-the-best-for<br>
; but the rationality criterion imposes constraints on the ways one may<br>
do the best for oneself and other (particularly in that there is a *<br>
practical* assymetry: one has relatively intimate knowledge of and<br>
control over oneself, not so of and over the other).<br>
<p>
And in fact, as Henry Hazlitt showed in his "Foundations of Morality" (a<br>
rare and amazing book), in life on this earth, nine times out of ten the<br>
rationally self-interested action in any given circumstance is nearly<br>
always one and the same as the rationally other-interested action.<br>
