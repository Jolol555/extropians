<i>&gt; &gt;self-sustaining. MAX: have you ever spoken to Glenn Tenney about how</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;he/they run(s) Hackers?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No. I'd like to. How can I get hold of him?</i><br>
<p>
Try tenney@hackers.org. You also *might* be able to get some useful hints<br>
from the people who put on "contact" ... I don't know how to get in touch<br>
with them (ironic, no? but I think some people on the list/members of the<br>
Institute might.<br>
<p>
Keep in mind (and this opinion is strictly sub rosa) some people think<br>
that one or both of the above have ossified and/or dried up; so pick and<br>
choose the strategies you model.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Shorter, tight sessions. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmm, some want longer sessions, some shorter...</i><br>
<p>
This is one of the reasons people multitrack. (grin/grimace--see below)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;And of course multitracking. There are obvious risks and costs, but it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;traditional. This should be enough for us to view it with suspicion. :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've never liked this, and many people seem to feel the same way. It may</i><br>
<i>&gt; become necessary if attendence multiplies.</i><br>
<p>
One of the tradeoffs here is between cohesion/"jackdaw epistemology" in<br>
the good sense (we all get to have more nearly the same conference) and<br>
birds-of-a-feather/stultification/stratification/ossification. How much do<br>
you want to shake people out of talking the same old thoughts to the same<br>
old people? How do you do that respectfully and congruently and still grow<br>
the conference/BEST DO IT SO mindshare?<br>
<p>
These are tough questions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Thanks for your comments Michael.</i><br>
<p>
You're quite welcome.<br>
<p>
