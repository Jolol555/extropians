Paul, I cannot off-hand find the precise issue of "Skeptical Inquirer"<br>
in which this experiment was discussed. Do you have that information<br>
on hand? I do know that several statistical analyses of astrological<br>
phenomena have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.<br>
Some of these have reported statistical significance. I also know<br>
that that there is a great deal of abuse of statistics by scientists<br>
in just about all disciplines, usually because the professional<br>
scientist failed to consult a professional statistician. As I recall<br>
the history, "Skeptical Inquirer" published a review of the article<br>
and questioned the statistical methodology. However, I may be mistaken.<br>
<p>
"Skeptical Inquirer" usually has several articles on the current<br>
pseudoscience silliness, and also ususally has scholarly articles<br>
on the nature of memory, belief, and other psychological phenomena.<br>
<p>
I find these articles especially relevant to the discussions on this<br>
group about the nature of consiousness, the mind, uploading, and memes,<br>
Also to the way some of us (including me) latch onto beliefs.<br>
