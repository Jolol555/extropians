"A swarm of suveillance mites slowly descends from the sky ... they<br>
assemble and process the information into a detailed picture of the<br>
state of the atmosphere".<br>
<p>
So begins Ivars Peterson's story in the July 26, 1997 issue of SCIENCE<br>
NEWS called "From Microdevice to Smart Dust: Learning to Build,<br>
Program, and Control Multitudes of Interacting Micromachines".<br>
<p>
The article is based primarily on the work of Andrew Berlin at Xerox<br>
PARC and Kaigham Gabriel of DARPA reported in the Jan-Mar 97 IEEE<br>
COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE &amp; ENGINEERING, but Peterson adds some additional<br>
cites:<br>
<p>
"the technology necessary for constructing a 'smart dust particle' may<br>
be within reach in 5 years, says Berlin."<br>
<p>
"By merging sensing and actuation with computation and communication,<br>
MEMS [microelectriomechanical systems] devices can be distributed<br>
throughout the environment, coated on surfaces, or embedded within<br>
everyday objects to create distributed systems for sensing, reasoning<br>
about, and responding to events in the physical world on a scale never<br>
before possible", wrote Berlin &amp; Gabriel in their IEEE article.<br>
<p>
Peterson mentions "one potential application is a paper mover" and<br>
micromanipulation assembly lines for electronics and biological<br>
research.<br>
<p>
"At Stanford University, Gregory T.A. Kovacs and John W. Suh have<br>
fabricated cilliary arrays in which each microscopic actuator looks<br>
like the tail of a fish.... Four actuators, arranged in a cross with<br>
tails pointing away from the center, work together a a unit, or motion<br>
pixel....<br>
<p>
"Donald and Karl F. Bohringer ofd the University of Calif., Berkeley<br>
have developed what they call the theory of programmable force fields<br>
to model the actions of cilliary arrays.... Peter Will and his<br>
colleagues at the Information Sciences Institute of [UCLA] have<br>
adopted a similar approach....<br>
<p>
"'How do you program a cloud of dust?' Berlin asks. Should all the<br>
smart dust particles run the same program, or should they specialize?<br>
How do units synchronize their activities when they are in motion<br>
relative to each other and spread over large distances? How can<br>
communication be established and maintained in such a system? How can<br>
it build a global view of a situation using many small pieces of<br>
information that are gathered in different places at different times. <br>
'There are alot of hard problems here', Berlin says."<br>
<p>
IMO, these are many of the same hard problems that must be solved for<br>
AI and nanotechnology. MEMS seem to be a practical, near-term test bed<br>
for experimenting on some of these problems.<br>
