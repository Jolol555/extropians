<i>        &gt;A speed-up of the order you talk about would require new hardware</i><br>
<p>
True, but even now the distinction between hardware and software sometimes <br>
gets a bit blurry.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;that hardware needs to be assembled, which is a physical process         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;which cannot be made arbirarily fast. </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
The black goo must physically move too, spread over thousands of miles if it <br>
is to destroy all life. In that time a Nanocomputer could perform a gargantuan <br>
number of calculations, and to the minds running on those machines the spread <br>
of the goo would seem to move about at fast as the hour hand on your <br>
wristwatch.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;This means that a minute or two would not ba a  "geological time" </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The fastest signals in the brain move at 100 meters per second, many are much, <br>
much, much, slower. Light moves at 300,000,000 meters per second and Nano <br>
computers would be far smaller than neurons, further increasing the speed <br>
advantage.<br>
                     <br>
<i>        &gt;But suppose that you were right about this. Then the first power to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;get to the "singularity" [...]  would only need to be a *few seconds*         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;ahead of the competition to become the ruler of the universe </i><br>
<p>
                     <br>
Yes, I think that's true, but we were talking about black goo. If the first <br>
team that develops Nanotechnology consists of a bunch of homicidal maniacs <br>
then we are all in deep shit, but that's not the first time something like <br>
this has come up. If you're attacked by black goo you won't be one bit deader <br>
than you would be if you were vaporized by an H bomb.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I think you are vastly overestimateing the acceleration.</i><br>
                  <br>
<p>
I'd say more but a million and one things have just popped up and I have no <br>
time.                                               <br>
