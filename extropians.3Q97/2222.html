OK. With 10^80 particles, 4.4 x 10^81, or 10^86 - no matter, both are<br>
finite numbers. BTW, thanks for doing the calculations.<br>

Well, I wouldn't know about Omega Points - if they exist, it's a long,<br>
long<br>
way off from now. My focus is on the present limits to what can be<br>
represented<br>
in this universe, pretty much as it is now.<br>

<i>&gt; Mine too. The idea that you can tell if something is real by examining it's</i><br>

<i>&gt; line is much simpler than the tree trunk of a pine tree, yet I think you</i><br>
<i>&gt; would say the tree was more real. Why? The shape of the Mandelbrot Set is</i><br>
<i>&gt; more complex than the shape of a grape, yet you say the grape is real and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; set is not. Exactly what is the relationship between complexity and reality?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
A Preal object is represented by the particles which comprise it. This<br>
implies that repesenting this object at most requires about the same<br>
number of bits. Note that I am content to use the value you cited for a<br>
hydrogen atom, so n*10^6 bits will do.<br>
<p>
Your example of a line vs a pine tree is just a bit misleading. The<br>
definition of the line is very simple, a true line is not a Preal<br>
object. Obviously a pine tree is more complex than a definition of a<br>
line.<br>
<p>
A Real object such as the Mandelbrot set's shape cannot be directly<br>
represented. Its abstract definition is easily stated in a few hundred<br>
bytes, and this definition is therefore Preal. In fact, the Mandelbrot<br>
set is a rather simple object in terms of complexity theory since its<br>
description is very much smaller than its resulting representation!<br>
