I suggest social shunning of people who seem to be torturing creatures<br>
substantially different from themselves.  A positive prospect is that<br>
the most useful experiments will probably be best done on copies of<br>
yourself - that gives you the most info about improving yourself. <br>
So experimenting on creatures very different from yourself is already<br>
suspicious.  Especially if those other creatures are smart enough do<br>
decide for themselves what experiments would help them improves<br>
themselves.  The problem is experiments on "dumb" different creatures.<br>
