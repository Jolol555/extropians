Of Jane Jacobs' book _Cities and the Wealth of Nations_, the Willow<br>
writes<br>
: &gt;She posits the city as the basic unit of economic expansion,<br>
: &gt;especially through the route of import-replacement, namely the<br>
: &gt;development of local industries to make what had formerly been imported<br>
: &gt;from other cities.  I haven't read any further in the book yet, but it's<br>
: &gt;been very exciting so far.  I hope I've conveyed a bit of that.<br>
<p>
She uses the term "city region", distinguishing cities with extensive<br>
influence on the hinterland, like Tokyo or Los Angeles, from others<br>
like Rome without such influence; she says (I paraphrase from memory)<br>
that twenty miles from Rome you wouldn't know there's a city nearby.<br>
<p>
CurtAdams responds<br>
: An interesting supporting point to her claim - I don't know if<br>
: she makes it in that book - is that many countries are almost<br>
: just one giant city-state and its hinterland.  Examples: [...]<br>
: The city-state is typically 1/6 or so of the population,<br>
: more of the economy, and overwhelmingly dominant cultually. <br>
: Even the US has been such, with New York City playing the role<br>
: from about the Irish Potato Famine to WWII.  Naturally not all<br>
: countries are like this, but it's surprisingly common.<br>
<p>
To me her most interesting claim is that this dominance by one city<br>
is partly an artifact of a single currency.  When a region's exports<br>
lose market share in the world economy, the exchange value of its<br>
currency ought to decline, giving the signal that it's time to cut<br>
imports and begin import-replacement, which is the key step on the <br>
road to developing new exports.  But when multiple city-regions share <br>
a currency, the signals to each of them gets muddled in with signals<br>
to the others, the usual result being that the capital gets the right<br>
signals and expands, while other cities (Manchester, Marseille) get the<br>
wrong signals and decline.  Her metaphor: an elephant, a monkey and a<br>
hummingbird, all sharing a single heart.  The US has largely escaped<br>
the pattern because the role of "capital" is divided between New York,<br>
Washington and now Hollywood.<br>
