<p>
<i>&gt;Why are you assuming at the outset a 50/50 chance of doomsday?</i><br>
<p>
Just as an illustration. The mathematics is easier if we restrict <br>
the example to two alternatives.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You are saying that there are two human races, one where doomsday</i><br>
<i>&gt;occurs, and one where it does not.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, no! This is a subtle point which people tend to miss. If<br>
there existed one very breif and one very long-lasting race, then<br>
the Doomsday argument *wouldn't* work! This is because in that<br>
case there would be a greater prior probability that I would be in the<br>
long-lasting race (after all, the overwhelming majority would be in<br>
that race). It is easy to verify that this change in the priors exactly<br>
counterbalances the probability shift that we are to make upon<br>
discovering that we exist in the initial segment of a race. (See my<br>
paper for the calculation.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Then you go on to predict how many</i><br>
<i>&gt;people will exist in the one where it does not. Actually there are an</i><br>
<i>&gt;infinite number of human races where doomsday does not occur, each with</i><br>
<i>&gt;a different number of people -- an infinite number of urns with</i><br>
<i>&gt;differing numbers of balls. </i><br>
<p>
We have no reason to believe that there are an infinite number of<br>
human races. There are, however, an infinite number of *possible*<br>
human races. Pardon me if this sound like philosophical hair-cutting,<br>
but for the DA it makes an absolutely  crusial difference.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Give me a billion urns (too little to begin with) each with a different</i><br>
<i>&gt;number of balls, and then tell me which urn has ten balls in it.</i><br>
<p>
No problem. You have to specify the prior probability distribution<br>
over the probability space, though. This means you have to tell me<br>
how many urns there are containing n balls, for each n. Then it is<br>
just standard Bayesian statistics.<br>
