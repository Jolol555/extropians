That formation is on the list of interesting things for the Mars Orbiter<br>
Camera to image during the Mars Global Surveyor mission later this year.<br>
There are some technical issues about targeting something that small with<br>
the high-resolution camera, though, so it might not make the cut.  There's<br>
