<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Direct testimony to Congress, for starters.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But there is politics in aerospace development and procurement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll address the "no politics" claim again a little further on.</i><br>
<p>
What happens before the engineers put something on paper and prototyped<br>
is not part of the engineering process, it is market research. That the<br>
market can't pull its head out of its proverbial ass is in no way the<br>
fault of the engineers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The more complex a device, and the more severe its</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;operating environment, the greater its maintenance requirements.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is tautologous: the harder things are, the harder things are.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But the better technology and wealth get, the more overdesigned</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the environment a piece of gear can be. You don't seem to address this.</i><br>
<p>
I don't address it because in the context of our dicussion, my assertion<br>
is that our most likely alien visitors will not be that much farther up<br>
the technological scale than we are, contrary to most people's<br>
fetishistic fantasies of technological paradise in alien civilization.<br>
Given this, they will have not had enough experience in interstellar<br>
length missions to be able to overengineer their vehicles for the<br>
operating regeime.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;You do know the story of the B-1 and of F-111s, right?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; To take the latter example, suppose I insisted on fielding a full</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; complement of F-111s (the B variant, I think) fully loaded with Phoenix</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; on an aircraft carrier. You're going to have hella high maintenance</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; if you really want to keep everything flying; in fact the carrier may</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; never be the same, either:). Those tubs land *hard*.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;F-111s have been flown on carriers, and were originally supposed to be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;multiservice platform. The naval version was going to have several more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;struts in the fuselage, a sturdier wing, and heftier landing gear.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Evidently you _don't_ know the story.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm keeping myself from laughing my guts out here. Talk to one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; F-111B crew chiefs, as I have. They _could not_ get that puppy to hunt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm familiar with the B variant mods, the plane was still too heavy</i><br>
<i>&gt; to land on an aircraft carrier unless you burned off all the fuel and</i><br>
<i>&gt; launched missiles (expensive missiles) before landing. Not very cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; effective. Oh, you could underload the planes, but then they had a</i><br>
<i>&gt; real hard time performing their mission--long loiter fleet stand-off</i><br>
<i>&gt; defense--you need the fuel _and_ the missiles.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I worked on those particular hogs, sir. I do know what pigs they are<br>
considered now compared to other newer planes. When they were new, they<br>
were the hottest shit in the skies. I was a phase dock inspection cheif<br>
for the electro-environmental systems at Cannon AFB, working on the D<br>
model. I also did work on the flight line. WHile they are bigger than<br>
the F-14, they are not bigger than the Crusader nor the E-2. With its<br>
swing wings, it actually can come in at a rather low speed. Like I said,<br>
in order to make that plane useful to a carrier crew in the 60's all it<br>
would have needed were a couple of body struts and heavier duty landing<br>
gear.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As I said, the decks didn't like it much either. Oh, you could beef</i><br>
<i>&gt; up the carrier deck--but that would take the carrier out of service</i><br>
<i>&gt; for *quite* a spell while there's a war on, and the gross tonnage</i><br>
<i>&gt; gets screwed up, so you can't carry as much ship's stores, so now</i><br>
<i>&gt; the _carrier_ has trouble performing _its_ mission... and around</i><br>
<i>&gt; and around.</i><br>
 <br>
SOrry, the Ardvaark is not any heavier than other planes which land<br>
regularly on aircraft carriers, and would not have posed any additional<br>
wear on the decks.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; F-111s were developed _by order_ of Macnamara, who *knew* that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; life cycle costs of a "joint" vehicle *had* to be less. Others</i><br>
<i>&gt; *knew* what the mission-role requirements had to be for the Air</i><br>
<i>&gt; Force and Navy. Even Silly Putty can only stretch so far.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And everybody was making money even if the thing didn't work,</i><br>
<i>&gt; so what the hell?</i><br>
<p>
In the end, granted, the F-111 is an example of the worst top level<br>
compromise of specs, but that has absolutely nothing to do with the<br>
engineering. If an engineer is told to build such and so a plane for a<br>
given budget, he or she goes and designes the best damn plane they can<br>
for those requirements.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;There is no politics in engineering.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; OK; then the Shuttle and modern aerospace contract developments</i><br>
<i>&gt; like the F-111, Shuttle and America's Vanishing Space Station</i><br>
<i>&gt; are not engineering. We agree. :)</i><br>
<p>
Why do you take the worst examples alone? How about the best examples,<br>
like the 747-400, the F-15, etc.<br>
<p>
The shuttle was an obvious abortion produced by a specs committee that<br>
couldn't agree on what it wanted. Typical 70's politics. THis does not<br>
mean that the shuttle does that compromise mission to the best of its<br>
abilities.<br>
<p>
The Space station isn't even a product of engineering yet, so you can't<br>
even include it in this argument. The station has been used to spread as<br>
much pork around as possible, with no plan to actually build something.<br>
Every new administration and congress feels that it has to redesign it<br>
in order to get their own names on the project. You seem to be confusing<br>
the inability fo the customer to decide what it wants and whether it<br>
wants to pay for it with the engineers ability to deliver what the<br>
customer says it wants.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The biographers of Max Faget will, I hope, address the Shuttle</i><br>
<i>&gt; and its co-option into its current bad design. If we have to,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll go into it. However, just talking about Shuttle ops,</i><br>
<i>&gt; permit me to commend to your eyes</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; _The Challenger Launch Decision: Risky Technology, Culture,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Deviance at NASA_ by Diane Vaughn, University of Chicago Press, 1996,</i><br>
<i>&gt; ISBN 0-226-85176-1.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Onward.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The service ceiling of a standard B-1 is less than 30,000</i><br>
<i>&gt; feet. Why? This is *not* the original spec; it was supposed</i><br>
<i>&gt; to outfly the B-52 in all particulars, all conditions.</i><br>
<p>
The B-1A was designed for high altitude supersonic penetration, low<br>
altitude attack. When word came through intelligence channels that newer<br>
russian radars were specifically designed to pick up returns from<br>
supersonic shock waves, that nixed the whole supersonic idea. Then<br>
Carter nixed the B-1A.<br>
<p>
On came Reagan with the revamped B-1. By this time, the AF had<br>
formulated that a low altitude (nape fo the earth) subsonic flight<br>
regieme was the best way to penetrate Soviet defenses, so the specs for<br>
the new B-1B were changed from that of the B-1A, which is why it has a<br>
different model type specification.<br>
<p>
In its particular flight regeime, it can outfly the B-52 by a huge<br>
margin, and is much more stealthy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;You think that there will be less than 1 maint hour per flight hour? It</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;hasn't happened yet, and the curve averages upward over time, so I doubt</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that it will happen for anything but the most low stress flight regeimes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;for quite a while.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I did not exclude *any* flight regime, and neither did you</i><br>
<i>&gt; at first--why do you now feel you have to?</i><br>
<p>
Because I acknowledge that with simple planes flying in low subsonic<br>
ranges with no aerobatic use, they can be easily overengineered due to<br>
the length of time we have been flying in that regieme. Materials<br>
technology can just barely handle the upper limits of our present top<br>
flight regeimes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wanna bet?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My bet proposal: I pick "General Aviation, Ultralights</i><br>
<i>&gt; (an artificial distinction created by the FAA) and Subsonic</i><br>
<i>&gt; RPVs" as the flight regime, and I restrict</i><br>
<i>&gt; the pertinent maintenance time spent to that spent on</i><br>
<i>&gt; airframe, powerplant and VFR instruments (i.e., the</i><br>
<i>&gt; equipment needed for safe VFR operation in 1950),</i><br>
<i>&gt; over the useful life of the airframe or powerplant,</i><br>
<i>&gt; whichever fails first.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What do you like for the stakes?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Just for the record, 150 hp Zoche turbo diesel engines will</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably run $20k. :)</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, I see the ace in your sleeve. An RPV is a remotely piloted<br>
vehicle, hardly a category  which has had millions of hours of<br>
engineering and flight time yet. Now standard man rated ultralights are<br>
an area I'd bet on. I'd even bet on a particular plane: the Paraplane.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;As for your assertion of any visitors not being detected, this goes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;against logic. Given that some group, corporation, or government on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;another planet would have shelled out billions if not trillions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;EBE-bucks for such an expedition, the idea that they would not try to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;wring out the maximum PR, scientific, or economic value from that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;investment is ludicrous.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Ah, but why is this a given at all? And who says they'd derive any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; benefit from being seen? How can you (or Hara Ra) be sure you know</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; what their payoff matrix is for be3ing seen? What if their motto</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; really is "Primum non nocere (at least at first...)"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;So your beleive in alien abductions?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Because Occams razor tells me if screwed up creatures like us with our</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;screwed up ways of doing things can make it, then any visitors are just</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;as likely to come from screwed up planets as well, and just as likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;have short sighted, self centered, idiotic politicians and bureaucrats</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in charge of things on their home planet. The ideas that people get from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Star Trek  are much more unlikely than things continuing much as they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;are now.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Read Scott Adams new book, Dilbert Futures, in which he states "The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;future will NOT be like Star Trek." because people will still be as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;screwed up as they are now, they'll just have cooler high tech toys to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be screwed up with.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I find myself unable to follow your reasoning. I find your confidence</i><br>
<i>&gt; in your ability to predict other lifeforms' reasoning charming, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; arbitrary. I couldn't have even predicted how relatively _un_ fucked up</i><br>
<i>&gt; _I_ am now if I'd tried to, say, six years ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Its rather simple. If we can make it as screwed up as we are, then the<br>
law of regression to the norm says that the most likely aliens we will<br>
meet will be just as screwed up as we are, not some fantastic<br>
technological and socioloigically perfect gods.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, I don't "believe in alien abductions". You seem to "believe" that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;short sighted, self centered, idiotic politicians and bureaucrats</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in charge of things</i><br>
<i>&gt; somehow never screw up big engineering, and that's a bigger whopper</i><br>
<i>&gt; than I could ever swallow these days. I don't get it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
No, I beleive that engineers usually don't screw up big engineering. I<br>
personally view engineers on one side and politicians and bureaucrats on<br>
the other in a planet wide battle of building and destroying. That we<br>
succeed in spite of politicians and bureaucrats says volumes about<br>
engineers.<br>
