I like this idea a lot.  One of the things which bugs me about the<br>
current radical libertarian movement, I think, is the frequent<br>
screeching against government as an immoral intrusion upon the innocent<br>
free society.  It may be immoral, but some form -- of many different<br>
forms!  -- of government has been natural to every stable human<br>
society.  Hunter-gatherers might be closest to anarchy, but they're<br>
without much war, not without violence.  And we aren't<br>
hunter-gatherers.  Since then any natural anarchy that I know of has<br>
promptly moved into warlordism, one of the uglier forms of government.<br>

Not just small.  China stagnated technologically from the 14th century<br>
(Jacobs claims China since unification -- 221 BC -- was far less<br>
innovative than before, but I dunno) and it was pretty big.  It was<br>
almost everything of interest around it, except for island Japan, which<br>
did something similar, and Korea, about which I know little.  Such<br>
isolation may well be the problem, of course, which argues against<br>
simple world-government schemes rather strongly.<br>

<p>
Ah, well, happiness and growth don't necessarily maximize each other.<br>
Not when happiness can come from play and exploration (not to mention<br>
watching TV, but never mind), and growth involves working hard to get<br>
the necessities of life, or feeling compelled to grow fast to afford<br>
defense, or because someone who grows faster might turn around and<br>
gobble you up.<br>
<p>
My extropian dream, which I think is shared by the Culture, is to reach<br>
a state where play and exploration ('science') by conscious entities,<br>
combined with automation of grunge work, can outcompete/outgrow (because<br>
of the massive playfront) workaholic conscious entities maximizing<br>
short-term growth by gobbling, or whatnot.  I'm not sure this is<br>
possible.  But I think this connects with what Holly Pearson and Paul<br>
Hughes were saying.  They'd rather live ludically than strenuously.  Or<br>
consider the recent debate over the Netherlands' economy: the fact that<br>
many Dutch aren't working might indicate that they're onto a good thing.<br>
So they aren't growing.  There is growth not measurable by dollars.<br>

Banks on von Neumann machines: "It would be perfectly possible to build<br>
a Von Neumann machine that would build copies of itself and eventually,<br>
unless stopped, turn the universe into nothing but those self-copies,<br>
but the question does arise; why? What is the point? To put it in what<br>
we might still regard as frivolous terms but which the Culture would<br>
have the wisdom to take perfectly seriously, where is the fun in that?"<br>
<p>
Alas, evolution does not seem to select for fun.  Evolution seems to<br>
select for the ability to turn the universe into nothing but<br>
self-copies, or the ability to render other-copies inoperative.<br>
Competition works.  The question, I think, is to what degree can<br>
competition be tamed?  We've already done a decent job: ideas compete<br>
and die before leaving our minds, then compete to survive criticism.<br>
Thus progress can happen without hurting people (although it will change<br>
them) if they don't indentify with their ideas too strongly.  Companies<br>
compete and fail, but their component humans can get new jobs.<br>
Wargamers ravage galaxies on tabletops.  I suggest that we should want<br>
to encourage this trend.  <br>

"The problem with Danny was that he felt the entire human race was so<br>
peculiar that no single peculiarity, unless it was harmful, made any<br>
more impression on him than any other.  He knew, mostly from painful<br>
experience, that other people had different reactions, and he could make<br>
you feel like a creep or a bigot in ten seconds." -- Pamela Dean,_Tam Lin_<br>
