Hal Finney quotes Gregory J. E. Rawlins:<br>
<i>&gt; ... A century or so</i><br>
<i>&gt; from now, the earth may simply be the home world of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; species rich and strange, a fiercely new and amazingly</i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting species---transhumanity. </i><br>
<p>
Listening to Greg Stock at Extro 3 I formed this hypothesis: that what<br>
most unites us is a conviction that within a century (or two at most)<br>
the world will be a VERY different place.  Greg had been arguing that<br>
people shouldn't try to stop some simple genetic possibilities,<br>
because things are going to get lots stranger that that and people<br>
better get used to it.  And it seeems to me that most elements of our<br>
community can be understood as coming from our taking the idea of a<br>
strange future very seriously.<br>
<p>
Lots of people seem to sorta believe in a strange future, yet seem<br>
unwillling or unable to actually take the time to think seriously<br>
about it. <br>
<p>
But I wonder:  is there any smart person out there who understands the<br>
sorts of arguements that lead us to expect strangeness, and yet who<br>
disagrees with our conclusion?  <br>
