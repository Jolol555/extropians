Eliezer Yudkowsky writes<br>
: ...  Essentially, you have to get rid of money and replace it with<br>
: a barter system.  We *can* do this now because we have enough computing<br>
: power to institute "complex barter" systems.  [...]<br>
<p>
I'll believe it when I see it.<br>
<p>
: Complex barter is too hard to keep track of - without computers,<br>
: heh heh heh - which is why we have money, to transform every transaction<br>
: into a simple barter.  By "money", we here mean something with artificial<br>
: value, rather than universal units of exchange.  A complex barter system<br>
: can still have standardized units of valuation.<br>
<p>
So you'd abolish money *and* keep it.  Wonderful.<br>
Or did you just mean abolish fiat money?  No argument here.<br>
<p>
: What would be accomplished by this?  Well, one of the economic design<br>
: flaws leading to our current problem is - more than I can finish this<br>
: sentence with.  Here's what happens.  Person A, who builds widgets,<br>
: builds 100 widgets.  B through K also build 100 widgets.  Unfortunately,<br>
: there is only a market for 1,000 widgets total.  But 1,100 have been built.<br>
<p>
: The standard capitalistic reply at this point is that G, who isn't very<br>
: good at this, goes out of business.  There are only two problems:  First,<br>
: G can't get another job,<br>
<p>
Then G is in deep doodoo anyway when widgets are made obsolete!<br>
Why did G get into this business?<br>
<p>
: and more importantly, that's NOT what actually happens!  Instead, the<br>
: price of widgets drops. <br>
<p>
In the short term.  In the long term, G goes out of business.<br>
No contradiction.<br>
<p>
: Like a brick.  They trade widgets for cigar bands on a one-to-one basis. <br>
: The result is that not even E, who's the best, can make a living - much<br>
: less G.<br>
<p>
You can't predict how much the price drops, because any drop may make <br>
some other use for widgets economical, at which point it drops no further.<br>
<p>
Can the total price for all widgets fall?  I don't think so: <br>
if the old price was $N, we know that any number of widgets over 1000 <br>
is worth at least $1000N to the buyers; if the supply of widgets goes <br>
to 1100, they're *still* worth $1000N, so it seems to me that the price <br>
can't fall below $10N/11.<br>
<p>
: In an ideal world, this overproduction would simply raise standards of<br>
: living.  Really.  Think about it.  There are more widgets for everyone! <br>
: Hooray!  Again, ideally, food would be overproduced.  So the price of<br>
: food would drop as well.  The price of everything would drop, and widgets<br>
: would be dirt cheap, but so would be everything else, and A and E and G<br>
: and K would all be rich.<br>
:<br>
: The problem is that production of food is out of sync with production of<br>
: widgets.  The current economy was BUILT ON SCARCITY.  Everyone, everything,<br>
: is centered on the idea that supply is always slightly less than demand. <br>
<p>
Yeah, if "demand" means the number you get if you ask everyone "How<br>
many widgets could you use if they were free?" and add them all up.<br>
<p>
To an economist, demand is a (decreasing) function of price.<br>
<p>
: If one - and only one - field shifts to a massive-supply model, that field<br>
: suffers.  It's like being the only cooperator in a world of defectors. <br>
: You need a massive shift.<br>
: <br>
: And again, the existence of money is the problem.  Not private property! <br>
: I'm not saying that.  The problem is money instead of barter.  See, in a<br>
: barter system, you can establish valuations that can outlast supply and<br>
: demand, or at least weather the turbulence created by switching to an<br>
: Economy of Plenty.  Suppose that we declare one widget to equal one<br>
: hamburger in value.<br>
<p>
Price controls?!<br>
<p>
: Now, even if there are too many widgets, anyone who's made a widget can<br>
: still get a hamburger in exchange.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From whom?  Blank-out, as Rand would say.  You wave your hands and say,</i><br>
presto, a widget is worth a hamburger; for anyone who produces a widget,<br>
there's someone who'll be glad to provide a hamburger.  Meanwhile all<br>
the hamburger-makers are scratching their heads and asking each other,<br>
Do *you* want another widget??  Omnisciently-mediated complex barter<br>
won't change that.<br>
<p>
: G's widgets might rot, but that's better than all the widgets rotting. <br>
<p>
Irrelevant<br>
<p>
: We'll assume, actually, the existence of some buffer, some temporary<br>
: charitable system, so that G remains in business for at least a month<br>
: or two - while the production of hamburgers increases also.<br>
<p>
But why does the production of hamburgers increase?<br>
<p>
: We can also move up to establish a futures market - even better than<br>
: barter - for absolutely everything on the planet.  Then even G's widgets<br>
: don't rot.  Instead, everyone sells 91 widgets instead of 100 - which may<br>
: sound bad, but that's on a G-just-went-into-business model.  If you assume<br>
: a technological overproduction, 91 widgets is just what they sold last<br>
: year.  It's technological overproduction that's the problem, after all -<br>
: population expansion is self-correcting.  So everyone has an extra 9<br>
: widgets to trade for whatever they want.  Hopefully, someone besides<br>
: widget-makers is overproducing, so the surplus can all be traded around.<br>
<p>
If I understand you -- you cartelize the widget-makers, give each a<br>
quota of widgets to sell, to keep the price up; and then you tell them,<br>
go ahead and swap your excess widgets for anything so long as it's not<br>
money.  <br>
<p>
Result: a speculator obtains the excess widgets by barter,<br>
and sells them for cash, undercutting the other widgets.<br>
<p>
: Eventually, everyone overproduces,<br>
<p>
Why?<br>
<p>
: and those who produce the most wind up with the most of the overproduction. <br>
: So the system has two parts, really:  One, a futures market (applied to<br>
: EVERYTHING) so that overproduction doesn't cause prices to drop, and two,<br>
: a complex barter system - whose necessity is kind of hard to put into<br>
: words, but...  The value of a dollar is arbitrary.  If a widget-future<br>
: involves $5 a widget, the value of the contract is affected by fluctuations<br>
: in the money supply as well as the supply of widgets.  A widget-future<br>
: which involves trading one hundred hamburgers for one hundred widgets<br>
: may fluctuate all over the place in THEORY, but in practice, one hundred<br>
: hamburgers are what the widget-maker will eat this year.  In other words,<br>
: the universal futures economy is very vulnerable to inflation, which a<br>
: complex-barter system will stop.<br>
<p>
Drop the neo-communism and stick to reforming money.<br>
You're onto something there.  What if money is *defined* as futures?<br>
<p>
Have you read anything on competitive currency?<br>
