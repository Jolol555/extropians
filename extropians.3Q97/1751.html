<i>&gt; &gt;So anyway, let me ask you a question I've been struggling with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;about what the proper behavior should be.  Lets say you have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;very close loved one.  Say it is one of your children or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;something.  Lets say he's about 17 years old and you know that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;throughout his life he has consistently expressed a desire to not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be cryonically preserved possibly because he is a totally</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;convinced member of some religion which is against it.  Let's call</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;him Jeff.  You figure Jeff hasn't really seriously considered</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;dieing or whether he would really want to be preserved because he</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is so young even though he has several times explicitly said to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you he did not want to make any effort to be preserved.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Jeff has made his wishes clear</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"Do we preserve him or don't we?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you are a libertarian....... no.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;What would you tell them to do?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would respect his wishes in this matter.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I ask anyone that is a better moral expert than I, what should</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I do?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Morals are an individual matter, (therefore beyond experts) we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsible for our actions, unless mentally disabled. You should</i><br>
<i>&gt; do what you think best, but you should also take responsibility for</i><br>
<i>&gt; your actions, and realize if revived, Jeff may chose to have</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing to do with you for ignoring his wishes. </i><br>
<p>
Tell me, what crime is worse: kidnapping or murder? (rhetorical question!)<br>
<p>
Murder of course, because it's [effect is] irreversible. For this very<br>
reason, many oppose the death penalty; what if you **make a wrong<br>
judgement**? You can never undo the damage...the person is gone forever. <br>
<p>
So, in the case of the reluctant suspension victim, the choice is easy<br>
(unless<br>
you're full of ivory tower ideological crap, of course :(#(<br>
