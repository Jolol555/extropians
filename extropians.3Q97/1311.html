Absolutely.  One is never only or even necessarily importantly one's race,<br>
sex, orientation, age, or what have you, *however* so long as some such<br>
attribute has been singled out for the bullying attention of an otherwise<br>
more or less civilized polity, it is worse than futile for any individual<br>
to whom that attribute can be ascribed to insist that there is more to<br>
them *than* the attribute.  Of course there is.  That precisely this<br>
attribute has been so singled out is the problem at issue in the first<br>
place.  Unpopular minorities that so describe themselves are not seeking<br>
to perpetuate some special status but to recognize the existence and<br>
extent of an irrational prejudice.  What is wanted by unpopular minorities<br>
is rarely special rights but an end to special abuses.  Best, Dale<br>
