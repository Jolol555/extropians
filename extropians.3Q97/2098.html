These both seem very plausible.  In what sense, however, are they "legacy"?<br>
 Persuasiveness and skill at argument remain an excellent road to status<br>
(sales, law, management) and I believe it's been shown that a strong social<br>
network continues to provide good insurance for personal crises, whether<br>
social or financial.  As far as I can tell, they are "legacy" only in that<br>
reproduction is now limited by desire rather than resources.  In that sense,<br>
I'd wager that most of our courting and child-bearing habits are now legacy.<br>
