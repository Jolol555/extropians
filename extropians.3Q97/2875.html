<i> &gt; The question remains, is this kind of information really likely to</i><br>
<i> &gt; be important?  I can't imagine a plausible situation in which an</i><br>
<i> &gt; entity with the kinds of powers that nanotech confers is going to</i><br>
<i> &gt; find itself needing access to information from its biological past.</i><br>
<i> &gt; This may be a failure of imagination on my part though.  What kinds</i><br>
<i> &gt; of things could you see happening where it would need this information?</i><br>
<p>
Well, I don't think I'm going to remain interested in nothing more<br>
than accumulating capital forever.  One interesting challenge that<br>
looks like I could work on it for many centuries, at least, is<br>
self-transformation, self-improvement.  The more I know about all<br>
the legacy code embedded in my genes and my chordate nervous system,<br>
the better able I'll be to modify (and I hope improve) it.  Because<br>
this stuff is the product of an evolutionary process, it is shaped<br>
("written") by the history of the selection pressures that affected<br>
my ancestors and that affected the people who shaped my culture.<br>
<p>
I don't know enough about my legacy code yet to know exactly<br>
which information about the history of the selection pressures<br>
that shaped me is going to turn out to be most handy in my<br>
future self-creation projects.  So to the extent that I'm<br>
serious about this grandiose talk, I'm wary of cutting loose<br>
with the dance of Shiva on the delete key.<br>
<p>
Besides, one of my favorite Unix jokes is "Those without<br>
history are condemned to retype it."  ;)<br>
