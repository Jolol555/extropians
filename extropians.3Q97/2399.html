In a message dated 97-08-24 03:07:18 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; However, by your logic, every one of those 3 million you mentioned earlier<br>
 in this thread is "none of your business". I'm not trying for a cheap<br>
 rhetorical point, here, I'm trying to point out that it's a serious matter,<br>
 and as I said, sticky... &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Exactly...I deplore the practice....but it's their lives ...not mine.<br>
<p>
&lt;example of children being sub-human&gt;<br>
<p>
&lt;, I take it it should be none of my business should I see such a thing<br>
&lt;happen--barring of course shunning the parents? Or, since they were not<br>
&lt;fully human, would it be appropriate for me to shoot the 9-year-old and the<br>
&lt;7-year-old out of hand, the way I might a pair of feral dogs?<br>
<p>
If you consider today's legal morass and your're in that situation....you're<br>
doomed...not matter what course of action you take...including no<br>
action...you're subject to prosecution...the safest course ,however, is no<br>
action...which may be why noone intervened.  From my stand point I would want<br>
someone to rescue my child so I woluld assume someone else would feel the<br>
same ....the idea of shootting the two feral kids has some appeal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;More directly: there was the case of the woman who strapped her two kids in</i><br>
t&gt;he car and sent the car on a little swim, because she had the impression<br>
t&gt;hat they were the only thing standing in the way of her relationship with<br>
.a man who wasn't sure he was ready to be a father. If the kids were her<br>
<i>&gt;property, ditching the car is the same as ditching the car plus kids,</i><br>
<i>&gt;right? Property is property.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Then again, by rights of salvage, once she abandoned them, anyone who</i><br>
<i>&gt;rescued or recovered them would be their owner, right?</i><br>
<p>
Not a bad point....morally correct....legally by today's system...a mess.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;If you have responsibility then you must have authority to enforce the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;necesities of that responsibility...the two are coupled.  The current</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;situation is de-coupled...as a result it's all screwed up&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Any other position puts me in a position of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;(superiority/authority:responsible for his actions)  over that</i><br>
person...Slave<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Owner...which I am not and don't intend to be...</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Unless you procreate? Sorry, that's a cheap shot.</i><br>
<p>
Been there...done that...have successfully raised a boy...now 25..HE (and his<br>
wife) are (IMHO) successfully raising a boy and a girl).  Also I was a<br>
school-bus driver for five years....have lots of experience with feral kids.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;however much some beg to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;owned. Nor do I enjoy BEING owned...as is the current state of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;affairs...hopefully the advancing technology will continue the age-old</i><br>
trend<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of diminishing the power of the state....(slavers).relative to that of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;populance (slaves)</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Here we are "in violent agreement".</i><br>
<p>
Thank you<br>
<p>
