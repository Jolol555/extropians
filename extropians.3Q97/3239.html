Abraham Moses Genen writes<br>
: If those we elect become corrupt than we must blame ourselves for<br>
: permitting conditions to occur which encourages corruption. Our options<br>
: are to remove those who become corrupt and fail to represent us<br>
: adequately, and correct the defects in the system that allows and/or<br>
: provides the environment for corruption.<br>
<p>
When we talk about the defects inherent in collective government, <br>
someone always says "This is a democracy, you can work within <br>
the existing system."<br>
<p>
: For those who complain that too many of us do not vote and claim in<br>
: defense that their vote has no effect on the system, I say that every<br>
: vote has an effect whether our candidates win or loose.<br>
<p>
Yeah.  If I had cast a vote against financing the 49ers' new stadium,<br>
the mayor would have had to forge one more ballot in favor.<br>
<p>
: It might be interesting to consider some sort of proportional<br>
: representation system. ...<br>
<p>
Yes indeedy.  I heard that some major US cities adopted PR in <br>
the Twenties, and then dropped it like a hot potato because it<br>
let a Communist get elected here and there.<br>
<p>
: Possibly, that plus major campaign reform and public financing might<br>
: eliminate some of our administrative democratic problems?<br>
<p>
Give the incumbents *more* control over elections?!<br>
<p>
Here's major campaign reform: Get the govt out of the nomination game.<br>
Deregulate the primaries.  Print no names on the ballot (making<br>
all votes write-ins).<br>
