Well, as I say, I haven't made up my mind yet. I consider it <br>
conceivable that extinction would be more ethical.<br>
This is presupposing that the subject of reprogramming didn't <br>
have a "living will" or some such detailing "what to do if <br>
I get too weird for you" in the case of what are generally <br>
called "the mentally ill".<br>
<p>
"a violent person would thank you after the reprogramming"--<br>
ah, this is sometimes called "retroactive consent".<br>
"You'll thank me for this later, whoever you are _then_."<br>
You might be right, but would that be the same person?<br>
No worries, we'll just keep tweaking until whatever's left <br>
*does* thank us.<br>
<p>
Ever read anything by Robert M. Pirsig, especially his <br>
second book, _Lila_?<br>
<p>
At a minimum, I'd prefer that such activity be done with <br>
explicit consciousness on the part of the reprogrammers <br>
that they _might_ not know what they're talking about. <br>
Provide perspective to the subject: Keep a copy of the <br>
old personality around, just in case, and provide some <br>
A/B - B/A comparisons: do both personalities agree that <br>
B is better off? If not, then what?<br>
<p>
If we're going to stick with the notions of "self" we have now,<br>
I would feel better if everyone could choose integrity or death.<br>
Getting someone else's definition of "fixed" is a third choice.<br>
This is only because I don't know if I know what's best, and I<br>
_sure_ don't know if a bunch of strangers I've never met do.<br>
<p>
I come down strongly in favor of this mythical thing<br>
called "choice".<br>
<p>
Thanks for the opportunity to think about this.<br>
<p>
