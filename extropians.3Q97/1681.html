<i>&gt;      I too have been wondering about that particularly in the relationship</i><br>

<i>&gt;      uploading which are, albeit gaining some measure of scientific</i><br>

<p>
My sentiment exactly. Entropy (in its many forms) affects the universe<br>
and everything in it -- just look at my closet. :-) Extropy is both my<br>
short-term and long-term goal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      However, there is the more</i><br>
<i>&gt;      concrete and pragmatic pursuit of nutrition.  I'm wondering about how</i><br>
<i>&gt;      many extropians filter their water, pursue either vegetarian diets or</i><br>
<i>&gt;      thoughtfully chosen carnivorous diets (i.e., small quantities from</i><br>
<i>&gt;      reliable sources, not regular mindless grabbing of the package of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Foster Farms chicken at Safeway.)</i><br>
<p>
Oh my, I've been drinking unfiltered water? :-)<br>
<p>
Being a student, I've found that extropy tends to cost some money. As<br>
many list members would no doubt agree (given the stark capitalist bent<br>
of many subscribers), augmentation of one's available resources is one<br>
of the surest ways to facilitate the achievement of a measure of<br>
personal extropy. Health food costs an arm and a leg, never mind<br>
weightlifting supplements, legal and non-legal smart drugs, and, not the<br>
least of which, computing power.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  How many supplement their diets with</i><br>
<i>&gt;      a designed mineral and vitamin regimen?</i><br>
<p>
Designed? Mine is pretty ad-hoc. I've always been a healthy person<br>
(never had the traditionally childhood infirmities like chicken pox,<br>
mumps, tonsilitis, strep, etc.) and so I tend to work with what is<br>
naturally occuring in the foods I eat. I maintain a 45% carb, 35%<br>
protein, 20% fat diet, more or less. My main staples are chicken, egg<br>
whites, sushi, salads, peanut-butter sandwiches, and tons of wheat bread<br>
(with various spreads). I do take vitamin C regularly, as well as an<br>
antioxidant mix, when I remember. As a semi-pro swimmer, calorie<br>
restriction is absolutely counterproductive (bring those free-radicals<br>
on!).      <br>
<p>
For those weightlifters out there, creatine monohydrate is a must!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  How many wear sun block or</i><br>
<i>&gt;      otherwise fortify their skin to help it maintain it's younger appeal.</i><br>
<p>
Ugh. I lifeguard for a living during the summer and I NEVER wear<br>
sunblock. My Mediterranean skin is, of course, impervious to gamma<br>
(though when melanoma (sp?) bursts forth, I'll probably lose my<br>
superhero status). I publicly acknowledge that this makes me an absolute<br>
idiot.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;      How many smoke, drink substantial amounts of alcohol, eat a majority</i><br>
<i>&gt;      of refined foods.</i><br>
<p>
Nicotine is an occasional vice, occuring usually after the parallel<br>
(still occasional) vice of substantial amounts of alcohol. Refined foods<br>
are too expensive. I prefer to do my own cooking.   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      Why the questions?  To me, there is a relationship between the pitch</i><br>
<i>&gt;      and the substance.  The walk and the talk.  I look for it everywhere</i><br>
<i>&gt;      (including in myself).  Not expecting perfection, just ongoing</i><br>
<i>&gt;      awareness and a concerted effort.</i><br>
<p>
This is a great attitude. I shall strive ...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Just how sacred is the Extropian body in these days where we can only</i><br>
<i>&gt;      extend part scientific confidence and part good ol' faith in the life</i><br>
<i>&gt;      extension capabilities fashioned for immortality?</i><br>
<p>
I'm going to consider my response to this one. I hope others that are<br>
reading Rick's post do the same.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
