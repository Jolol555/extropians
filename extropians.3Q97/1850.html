[SNIP of EvMick needs excersize ]<br>
You can probably develop a set of excersizes that can be done in<br>
a hotel room or truck sleeper that will help but won't require<br>
any room or equipment. A simple example would be leg lifts, These<br>
can be done while reading, and will help the abdominals. I<br>
haven't looked, but I hope there's a book somewhere of excersizes<br>
you can do while reading. Some of them may be adaptable for<br>
use while using a laptop.<br>

I'm fairly sure a modern computer (say a Pentium 266 MMX)<br>
has all the raw capacity you'd need. I'd want a DVD, not<br>
just a CD-ROM, for the content. The problem, as always, is<br>
software, and in this case "content development." Note that<br>
some of what you want is already available in some golf and<br>
motorcycle arcade games. These tend to use a big-screen TV<br>
instead of VR glasses, but that's minor compared to the rest<br>
of the content you're looking for. The motion sensors are<br>
trivial when they are attached to any sort of articulated<br>
mechanical device. The physiological monitors are also<br>
trivial. Effectors of any type other than audio and visual<br>
are a bit harder, but still not that hard: look at robotics.<br>
It would also be simple to build effectors based on small<br>
motors, vibrators, thermal pads, low-voltage AC electrical<br>
stimulators, and pressure/vacuum systems. (Yes, these<br>
could be used for virtual sex, but are certainly not limited<br>
to that, so get you mind out of the gutter.)<br>
<p>
So, there is no hardware engineering constraint that I know of<br>
on the system you want, with the possible exceptin of Scene<br>
generation. I suspect you can use video from the DVD by<br>
constraining the possible paths through the landscape that<br>
the user is permited to enter.<br>
