<i>&gt; } Hitler was an outstanding example of a "left wing extremist" even</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How so?</i><br>
<p>
Hitler promoted National Socialism in Germany.  Many European<br>
countries at the time competed with Germany and adopted it as well<br>
(they had little choice in countering the threat).  If Germany<br>
under Hitler hadn't been the first to go to the "extreme", another<br>
country would have (as others did).  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This, of course, begs the question.  The anarcho-(socialist,</i><br>
<i>&gt; syndicalist, communist) claim is that property, such as owning a</i><br>
<i>&gt; car which isn't used 90% of the time, or land you've never even</i><br>
<i>&gt; visited when there are landless peasants starving in megacity</i><br>
<i>&gt; slums, is theft and coercion.  So they would say "the 'right'</i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't survive without utilizing coercion (oxymoron!), or</i><br>
<i>&gt; adapting socialist techniques." Socialist techniques such as</i><br>
<p>
In practical terms, one could sell or give away time share or time<br>
use on the car or land and it would still be maintained properly<br>
since it has an owner.  (A current example would be "liberal"<br>
environmentalists buying up land solely for preservation purposes<br>
and to prevent "economic" development.)  Its highly unlikely there<br>
would be "landless peasants" anyhow in the absence of coercion. My<br>
understanding is fully on the coercion rather than capital as the<br>
"root of all evil", something the "left" will never understand<br>
being stuck in their dogma.  The "landless peasant" has the right<br>
and ability to profit on his own natural abilities and talent he<br>
was born with as does anyone else.  Denying that for inaccurate <br>
ideological rationalizations is anti-life.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ideological refugees?  Anarcho-communism is at least as old as</i><br>
<i>&gt; Marxism.</i><br>
<p>
My historical understanding is anarchy was never the initial<br>
breeding ground of socialists or communists, despite their desire<br>
that had it been that way.  (Coercion has always been around since<br>
the first "modern" civilization arose in Sumeria.)  Nowadays, with <br>
communism effectively discredited, they have no place to "go" but <br>
into "left" anarchy.<br>
