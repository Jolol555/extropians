Dear Sir,                                           27 August 1997<br>
<p>
I have read with mounting horror of the terroristic ordeal to which Mary <br>
Kay Schmitz Letourneau, the Seattle teacher, is being subjected by &lt;inter <br>
alia&gt; the King County Prosecutor's Office (Norm Maleng, who mistakenly <br>
call himself a Republican; his 'Chief of Staff' Dan Satterberg; and his <br>
deputy, Lisa Johnson) -- henceforth referred to as 'SMJ.'<br>
<p>
And by others who should have known better.<br>
<p>
<p>
As Dan Satterberg well knows, after the death of comedian Lenny Bruce <br>
(albeit not my favbourite comedian), Assistant Attorney General in the <br>
case, Vincent Cuccia, said this:<br>
<p>
"We drove him into poverty and bankruptcy.  We watched him fall apart.  We <br>
knew what we were doing.  We used the law to kill him."<br>
<p>
<p>
I have thorougly investigated the case of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau and <br>
her family, and have reached the following findings<br>
<p>
The King County Prosecutors (SMJ), and their collaborators, initiated a <br>
series of coordinated terrorist attacks on Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau and <br>
her family; they sought to "make an example of her" (so as to terrify <br>
others), in the exact words of a prominent Washington State Republican, <br>
who wants no part in it.<br>
<p>
<p>
TERRORISM: "The unlawful use of force or violence against persons or <br>
property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population or <br>
any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives." <br>
Such is the formal definition adopted by the FBI in 1982 and followed by <br>
other US government agencies.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
SMJ have attacked the role of the King Country Superior Court itself. The <br>
purpose of the Courts in America is to administer justice, not to 'make <br>
examoples of people' for social and political reasons.<br>
<p>
<p>
Worse (if anything could be) Maleng, Satterburg and Johnson have attacked <br>
the Constitution of the United States itself, and thus the rights of all <br>
Americans -- rights which they are personally _sworn to defend_.<br>
<p>
<p>
Accordingly, my colleagues and my associates have taken actions which <br>
include the following:<br>
<p>
I have filed Amicus Curiae briefs with the King County Superior Court.<br>
<p>
These are available at:  <a href="http://www.agora.demon.co.uk">http://www.agora.demon.co.uk</a>  or from the Court.<br>
<p>
<p>
I have filed formal complaints with the Washington State Bar Association.<br>
<p>
I have discussed this case with US Attorney-General Janet Reno's Office, <br>
documenting the KCPO's transgressions.  They are following the case now.<br>
<p>
I have discussed the attacks with a senior Anti-Terrorism officer of the <br>
fBI in Washington (including the possible collaboration of one or more <br>
persons in the Seattle FBI office:  they are examining these matters now.<br>
<p>
I have discussed these matters with Hillary Rodham Clinton's office at the <br>
White House, who now have full details.<br>
<p>
<p>
And with many, many others, in America and elsewhere<br>
<p>
<p>
There follows the opening passage of -- and excerpts from -- my <br>
third Amicus Curiae Brief to the Court, which was due to consider <br>
sentencing in the case on August 29th.<br>
<p>
<p>
{ SMJ are now trying to keep Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau locked up for <br>
even longer, by postponing the sentencing hearing to October 17th, on the <br>
pretext of examining (prima facie) unethical and unconstitutional <br>
'medical' sentences whose only purpose could be the attempted destruction <br>
of Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau's love for the father of her new baby <br>
daughter Audrey, who is being deprived of maternal contact and care in <br>
these crucial first months of her life].  The attempt to coercively <br>
'medicalize' ethics is a _disastrous_ policy.<br>

 "Today, 29 August, 1948, the USSR exploded its first Atom bomb.<br>
<p>
 A day of historic significance.<br>
 <br>
 Today, 29 August, 1953, the USSR exploded its first Hydrogen bomb.<br>
<p>
 A day of -- literally -- earth-shaking significance.<br>
 <br>
<p>
 Both Mary Kay Schmitz LeTourneau and I are children of the Cold War.<br>
<p>
<p>
 And this day, August 2 1997, is in all truth a day of Destiny and a <br>
 a day of reckoning...<br>
<p>
<p>
[1997 Note:  The brilliant American actress Dorothy Jean Seberg, from <br>
Marshalltown, Iowa, (see her in incomparable performances, in Otto <br>
Preminger's 'St. Joan', where -- as a 17-year-old girl -- she was <br>
chosen from 10 000 to play Joan of Arc; and in Robert Rossen's <br>
magnificent film 'Lilith.') was hideously and protractedly killed as a <br>
direct consequence of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's malicious actions <br>
against her.<br>
<p>
Hoover circulated vicious press stories including one that the baby she <br>
was expecting was of mixed race, and imposed unbearable pressures on <br>
her. She miscarried, and tried to kill herself on each anniversity of <br>
her lost baby's death.  She was later found dead in Paris, her body <br>
stuffed into a car trunk by the side of the road).<br>
<p>
David Richards' biography of Jean Seberg is titled 'Played Out.'<br>
<p>
<p>
And radical actress Frances Farmer's horrifying autobiography, "Will <br>
There Really Be A Morning?" (filmed as 'Frances' with Jessica Lange. <br>
[1983]) as a truly terrifying public warning of the perils and <br>
consequences of coercive psychiatry.  We _cannot_ allow such <br>
terrorist acts be committed against people anymore...<br>
<p>
    If all children (indeed, all of us) had ... inexpensive radio <br>
alarms, they would be greatly more secure from all kinds of abuse.  I <br>
have given this idea to Motorola Corporation. If JonBenet Ramsey had <br>
bean wearing one, she could have instantly summoned help, and could be <br>
alive today.  <br>
<p>
I am a formal external adviser to the Boulder, Colorado District <br>
Attorney's Office in her case.<br>
<p>
What was done to JonBenet Ramsay and to Mary Kay LeTourneau have <br>
matching patterns.  See especially the section 'The Little Fascist' in <br>
"What Do You Say After You Say 'Hello'?  The Psychology of Human <br>
Destiny"  by Eric Berne MD.<br>
<p>
                      ----------- * * * * * -----------<br>
<p>
             'Values as the expression of the central order'<br>
<p>
     'The problem of values is nothing but the problems of our acts, <br>
goals and morals.  It concerns the compass by which we must steer our <br>
ship if we are to set a true course through life. The compass itself <br>
has been given different names by various religions and philosophies <br>
... but I have a clear impression that all such formulations try to <br>
express man's relatedness to a central order.   In the final analysis <br>
the central order, or the 'One' as it used to be called with which we <br>
commune in the language of religion, must win out....<br>
<p>
  If we ask Western man what is good, what is worth striving for and <br>
what has to be rejected, we shall find time and again, that his <br>
answers reflect the ethical norms of Christianity even when he has <br>
long since lost all touch with Christian images and parables. If the <br>
magnetic force which has guided this particular compass - and what <br>
else was its source but the central order? - should ever become <br>
extinguished, _terrible_ things may happen to mankind, far<br>
more terrible even than concentration camps and atom bombs.'<br>
<p>
<p>
    Werner Heisenberg, [1971] 'Physics and beyond: encounters and<br>
conversations', published by George Allen and Unwin, London.<br>
<p>
<p>
    Thorpe is emphatic in asserting that we must never forget that such a<br>
conclusion must on no account be attributed solely to the Western insights<br>
stemming from the Christian revelation; he gives the following Admonitions as a<br>
further example, drawn from the Amerindian tribe of the Shawnees (who were<br>
dispossessed of their Oklahoma lands in 1839).<br>
<p>
<p>
TITLE: The Shawnee Admonitions:<br>
<p>
TEXT: (1)  "Do not kill or injure your neigbour, for it is not him you injure,<br>
you injure yourself."<br>
<p>
      (2)  "Do not wrong or hate your neighbour, for it is not him that you<br>
wrong, you wrong yourself.  Moneto, the Supreme Being. loves him also as she<br>
loves you."<br>
<p>
  Quoted from W.H. Thorpe, 'Purpose in a World of Chance' Oxford [1978].<br>
  A Biologist's View. George, Allen and Unwin.<br>
<p>
<p>
    This is clearly related via the central order to the (negative) <br>
Judaic injunction not to do unto one's neighbour that which one would <br>
not wish to befall one's self.  My own -- perhaps agnostic -- <br>
orientation is nearer Taoism [and Greek mythology]; but these ethical <br>
principles are capable of reformulation for most spiritual -- and even <br>
humanistic or atheistic -- contexts.<br>
<p>
                      ----------- * * * * * -----------<br>
<p>
In 1944, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation ran this magazine<br>
advertisement,showing a grim pilot, about to take on Zeros at twelve <br>
o'clock, imagining this staccato message to his wife:-<br>
<p>
    "I want to tell you what I'm fighting for... it's you and our <br>
little house and the job I had before... and the chance I had, the <br>
fighting chance, to go ahead on my own.  That's what all of us want <br>
out here... to win this war... to get home... To go back to living our <br>
lives in a land -- and a world -- where *every* [wo]man is free to <br>
grow as great as [s]he's a mind to be...  where *every* [wo]man has an <br>
*unlimited* opportunity to be useful to himself [or herself] and his <br>
fellow men [and women]...<br>
<p>
<p>
      Tell 'em we'll be back... nothing can stop us... And tell 'em no <br>
matter what they say, no matter what they do... to stay *free*.. to <br>
keep America a land of *individual freedom*! <br>
<p>
_That's_ what we're fighting for... <br>
<p>
_That's_ what we're willing to die for... <br>
<p>
_That's_ the America we want when we come home."<br>
<p>
<p>
So say Mary Kay Letourneau and I, I would guess.  Amen.<br>
<p>

<p>
There follow the three wishes, hopes and dreams I have for Mary Kay <br>
Schmitz LeTourneau and her family now, and for the future:<br>
<p>
<p>
However, Judge Lau, I have also risked my life to give _you_ maximal <br>
freedom to decide the case _yourself_ today.  This was also my duty to <br>
the Court, of course.  And to America.<br>
<p>
<p>
A question that is ultimately unanswerable by Mary Kay Schmitz <br>
LeTourneau (and myself) is this:<br>
<p>
<p>
 "Why must we love where the lightning strikes, and not where we choose?"<br>
   <br>
    -- Coventry Patmore, 1823 - 1896.  "The Angel in the <br>
       House" (1854-62]  and  "The Unknown Eros" [1877].<br>
   <br>
<p>
Anyway, my wishes:<br>
<p>
