Anders Sandberg replies:<br>
<i> &gt; Owning property, at least in the material sense, will become obsolete</i><br>

<p>
You forget that you own your own body, in the material sense.<br>
People who have a less delicate attachment to the notion of<br>
property than you often (charmingly) seem to, think of their<br>
property as an extension of their bodies.<br>
<p>
I can make sense of what you are talking about only in envisioning<br>
a future economy in which all physical computational capacity is<br>
on the market, and all people are recognized as immaterial information<br>
processes migrating to wherever they find their personal balance<br>
point on the price/quality curves.  But I think that's a *long*<br>
way in the future, and the future evolution of our society is going<br>
to pass through many tricky problematics long before we get to that<br>
point.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Just look at how ordinary pens tend to wander around, they are so</i><br>
<i> &gt; cheap that nobody cares if I happen to take one with me (ah, I see</i><br>
<i> &gt; I have a DoubleTree Hotel pen on my desk! I wonder how it got</i><br>
<i> &gt; here...?). People only get irritated when they need their pens or</i><br>
<i> &gt; when the acto of taking them clearly infringes on their territoriality.</i><br>
<i> &gt; Now imagine the same thing with other material stuff in a nanotech</i><br>
<i> &gt; economy. Still, rare or necessary stuff will likely remain in the</i><br>
<i> &gt; ownership sphere.</i><br>
<p>
Um, I think people will be rather sensitive to the migrations<br>
of their productive capital.  In a post-nanotech world, I might<br>
care as little about the migrations of my car as I now do about<br>
the migrations of my pen, but I'm probably going to still be a<br>
bit uptight about the fortunes of my feedstock supplies and my<br>
main fabrication equipment.  Certainly as long as I'm still on<br>
this planet.  And even in outer space, where fresh feedstock is<br>
mostly a matter of exploration and transportation, nothing<br>
more, I'm still going to be sensitive about my fabs.<br>
