<i>&gt; I wandered around the site and noticed the following definition</i><br>
<i>&gt; at the top of the current issue's page:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   "A libertarian is a person who believes that no one has the right,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   under any circumstances, to initiate force against another human</i><br>
<i>&gt;   being, or to advocate or delegate its initiation. Those who act</i><br>
<i>&gt;   consistently with this principle are libertarians, whether they</i><br>
<i>&gt;   realize it or not. Those who fail to act consistently with it are</i><br>
<i>&gt;   not libertarians, regardless of what they may claim."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is an interesting and somewhat curious definition.  According to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the above it would seem that any person who applied force to stop the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rape or murder of someone they loved would not be libertarian.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thus, for example, i fail this qualification in my current state.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is this the intent of "libertarianism"?  I seek to improve my</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding.  Thanks,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

The libertarians who like this definition usually argue that the key to the<br>
definition lies in the word "initiate."  They would say that you are not<br>
initiating force when you are acting in defense of yourself or others.  The<br>
rapist initiates the force, and you react with force only when it is<br>
initiated by another.<br>
<p>
I'm not positive that "never initiate force" works as a complete definition<br>
of the libertarian philosophy, but it seems like a pretty good<br>
generalization.  In any case, I don't think you act "unlibertarian" in the<br>
sense meant by this particular definition when you defend yourself (or, by<br>
extension, others).  That is not initiation.<br>
<p>
The interesting (and more often debated) part of the definition is the word<br>
"force."  I'm sure many a thesis has been devoted to the question.<br>
