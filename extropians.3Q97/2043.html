<i>&gt;Communism is an example of a simplestracted society; the government exists as</i><br>
<i>&gt;an additional link between producer and consumer.  A true communism requires</i><br>
<i>&gt;much less computing power to keep track of; the vast, tangled networks of</i><br>
<i>&gt;inter-consumer links are replaced by single links to and from the centralized</i><br>
<i>&gt;government.  Capitalism is streamlinked, having direct links to and from</i><br>
<i>&gt;consumer - with attendant improvements in feedback quality, response time,</i><br>
<i>&gt;efficiency, and direction.  Capitalism still requires far more computing</i><br>
<i>&gt;power, however.</i><br>
<p>
It's not clear that Communism "requires less computing power."  Obviously<br>
it does less good computing (of what to do and how), but remember that<br>
the people who live in a communist world still have to figure out where<br>
their next meal is coming from, what to do at work, where to live &amp; how<br>
to arrange that, how to live within or work around the rules, etc.  My<br>
guess would be that the more crazy the situation the more computing has<br>
to be done, just to get by.  The simplicity is false.<br>
<p>
Maybe a better example of simplestraction is mass production.  Like the<br>
Model T that was available in "any color as long as it's black."  There<br>
there was actually a savings in complexity over individually-made cars.<br>
With mass vs. custom production people are making a real choice between<br>
simplicity and cost.<br>
