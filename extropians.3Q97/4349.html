I have not taken part in this discussion of the<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Neuro-Semantic Political Illusion Complex &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</i><br>
because, just by looking at the title, I can tell perfectly well<br>
that this is something I don't want to hear about.<br>
<p>
If it had been titled:  "The Psychology of Irrational Politics" I would have<br>
read it.  If it had centered around evolutionary psychology, game theory, and<br>
the emergent patterns of political interaction, I would now be taking part in it.<br>
<p>
Strike one was the phrase:  "Neuro-Semantic".  I have never heard of anything<br>
called neurosemantics.  Neuro-linguistic programming strikes me as being<br>
theoretically incoherent but having dangerous practical potentialities.  The<br>
name remains totally off.<br>
<p>
I would never use the adjective neuro-semantic unless and until I was talking<br>
about a correspondence between a particular pattern of neurons and the<br>
low-level processing of semantic interpretations.  Even then, it would sound<br>
so pretentious I couldn't bear to do it.  Not that I'm never pretentious, but<br>
only when I'm ignorant.  I just know too much about neurology and semantics to<br>
use the two together.<br>
<p>
The second strike was the phrase:  "Political Illusion Complex".  We all know<br>
that politics warps rational thought beyond all recognition.  In the absence<br>
of information about specific instances, discussed from an engineering<br>
perspective, I am not interested in being told what I already know.<br>
<p>
Finally, regarding your accusations of Galilean persecution:  Even crackpots<br>
can have their ideas summarily and unfairly rejected, as the CSICOP-sTARBABY<br>
incident demonstrates.  Even people claiming to be upholders of rationality<br>
can engage in scientific distortion in what they think is a good cause.  But<br>
this does not cause me to sympathize with the crackpots.  Scientific<br>
distortion is always unacceptable.  Crackpots are also unacceptable.  I am<br>
under no obligation to choose a "right" side.<br>
<p>
It's entirely possible that the Extropians came down on you like a ton of<br>
bricks.  But my feeling is that calling your idea the Neuro-Syllabic<br>
Pretentious Industrial Carpet, or whatever, is simply asking for it.  If they<br>
had attacked you on scientific grounds, they would be under the obligation to<br>
do so fairly and objectively.  But I for one don't have the time to listen to<br>
every half-baked idea under the Sun, and you can't make me.  Come back when<br>
you have a title that doesn't make me wince.<br>
