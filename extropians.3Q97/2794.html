   About 10 years ago I came across a possible way to fake a UFO<br>
sighting in broad daylight over a populated area.  With sufficient<br>
cash (est ~$200,000), you could purchase/build a VTOL aircraft similar<br>
to what Mossier proposed, surround it with numerous small computer<br>
actuating mirrors that change orientation depending on the angle of<br>
the sun and the aircraft.  This would give the effect of a bright<br>
light in the sky similar to a reflecting mirror.  People on the ground<br>
would have a very difficult time identifying it through the blinding<br>
glare.  Also equipped on board, would be a specialized version of an<br>
EMP gun that would turn off peoples cars as you passed over them.  As<br>
for the RADAR blip, you might send a RF signal at the same Hz as that<br>
which radars use - with the intent that your signal would bounce off<br>
every radio transciever in the area.  If this works, the military<br>
would detect several radar blips instead of just one.<br>
<p>
I have never entertained this idea rigorously.  Amusing on it however,<br>
has increased my skepticism of UFO sightings knowing how easily they<br>
could be 'faked' by clever people with sufficient capital to blow.<br>
