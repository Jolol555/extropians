I'm not sure who wrote each of these - both replies to my original post came<br>
as attachments and I couldn't match them up with the e-mails:<br>

<i>&gt;  You really need to check out Java, and especially JavaBeans. Sun is in</i><br>
essence<br>
<i>&gt;  trying to make JavaBeans do exactly what you describe, And, if you don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;  have the right Beans, you can go get the ones you need from anybody who</i><br>
will<br>
<i>&gt;  give them or sell them to you, or program your own. You aren't stuck</i><br>
<i>&gt;  with a single-vendor solution. Microsoft seems to see the threat, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;  they are atempting to weasel out of their agreement to support Java.</i><br>
<p>
Java is close, but not close enough.  Java's good because it integrates the<br>
operating system with the programming language.  However it's a bit loose on<br>
the operating system side (Sun isn't sure if it is an OS).  The idea of<br>
'thin-clients' (such as the Java based NC) is directly the opposite of<br>
user-centricity (which favours a very fat client).  Sun's continued support<br>
of NC is taking it in the wrong direction.<br>
<p>
IMO, I think that Microsoft is more scared of the amount of hype Java is<br>
getting than any real threat.  It's changing Java to support it's own<br>
standards because it can't afford to put another layer on top of Win 95.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  You're up against tough competition.  Don't think that Microsoft is one to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  rest on its laurels...  Microsoft has invested significant research</i><br>
dollars<br>
<i>&gt;  into a variety of improvements to their OS which will have a profound</i><br>
<i>&gt;  impact on the way we interact with our computers, if only because</i><br>
Microsoft<br>
<i>&gt;  is monopolizing the market.</i><br>
<p>
Microsoft's Millennium project (which I have mentioned in previous posts) is<br>
very close to some of the ideas I spoke of.  Then again Windows 95 was a<br>
fast, malleable and simple OS when it was in research.  Then they add the<br>
corporate baggage!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  IMUninformedO, NLP or something similar is the next UI breakthrough,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  bridging the gap between the GUI and the neural interface; I'm also not</i><br>
<i>&gt;  convinced that AI is necessary to understand language.</i><br>
<p>
How would you do language understanding (very different from recognition)<br>
without AI?  How would the system match words with objects?  The great thing<br>
about AI is I can tell my computer to do something no programmer ever dreamed<br>
of, that will be the true computer revolution!<br>
