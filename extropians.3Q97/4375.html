If the following doesn’t interest you, check the PS for a question on<br>
a related topic.<br>
<p>
In light of Dan Fabulich’s<br>
-SAVE THE WHALES-     -COLLECT THE WHOLE SET-<br>
and Hara Ra’s recent comments about John Lilly disliking silicon<br>
brains, some might enjoy reading Dr. Lilly’s letter to the Wall St.<br>
Journal today:<br>
<p>
&lt; William Aron's Sept. 9 editorial-page commentary "Save the Whalers"<br>
contains errors about scientific evidence in regard to whales and<br>
their intelligence. It then uses these errors as justification of a<br>
reactionary position advocating an end to the international moratorium<br>
on whaling. Stating that "there are no data to support the belief that<br>
they [whales] are at or even near the top of the animal intelligence<br>
scale," Mr. Aron ignores evidence regarding brain size and cognitive<br>
capability of the cetaceans. By the established scientific standards<br>
used to classify brains, their sizes and relative intelligences<br>
associated with them, whales rank at the top of the animal kingdom,<br>
placing higher than the other large-brained cetaceans (dolphins) and<br>
Homo sapiens.<br>
<p>
Among the large variety (52 species) of dolphins and toothed whales<br>
that comprise the cetaceans, there are brain sizes ranging from ape<br>
size through the human size to the superhuman level of four to six<br>
times the human size. However, it's not so much size, but the<br>
structure of brains: where they enlarge and how they are used once<br>
they are enlarged. The larger cetacean brains are enlarged only in the<br>
associational silent cortex, the area of the brain associated with<br>
higher-thought language, and self-awareness. Presumptions derived from<br>
simple correlation between brain weight, body weight and body length<br>
simply have no relevance to brain survival. The idea that a large body<br>
requires a large brain is entirely backward--it is the large brain<br>
that needs a large body to survive.<br>
<p>
Paleontological evidence shows that the whales and the dolphins have<br>
been on this planet a lot longer than has man. Dolphins (like the<br>
current Tursiops) have been here on the order of 15 million years, and<br>
they have brain sizes equal to and greater than that of modern man.<br>
Secure human skulls in large numbers with a cranial capacity equal to<br>
present man are found only as far back as 150,000 years.<br>
<p>
Extensive behavioral observations of cetaceans demonstrating their<br>
communicative and cognitive abilities are the basis for recognizing<br>
them as intelligent, sentient individuals, deserving greater respect<br>
than mere "animal resources." Attempts to relax protection of<br>
cetaceans are immoral. We have much to learn from the other<br>
intelligent species of this planet. The whales and other cetaceans,<br>
residents of this planet for 30 million to 50 million years longer<br>
than humans, deserve expanded protections, rights and regard in our<br>
minds and under our law.<br>

P.S.  I recently found an essay at <a href="http://elfi.com/analogies1.html">http://elfi.com/analogies1.html</a><br>
by Francis Jeffrey called "Thoughts  About  Human / Computer <br>
Analogies" that deals with metaprogramming and biocomputers.  I just<br>
skimmed it and was amused by the final section called "Waiting For The<br>
Pen To Rise" which might have been a spoof of Roger Penrose’s notions<br>
of consciousness and Escher’s picture of a hand drawing itself.<br>
<p>
Aside from the essay, their commercial page notes:<br>
&lt; ELFNET is based on a simple &amp; universal idea: That communication<br>
computing should be done with "nerves" (dynamically interlinked<br>
virtual neuronal networks)...from interactive presentations to global<br>
nets. The result will be flexible systems with lucid overviews ,<br>
comprehensible to humans. This technology is now available. &gt;<br>
<p>
Has anyone ever heard of this or used it?<br>
