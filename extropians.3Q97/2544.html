<p>
Rearranging graphite to diamond is a very low-energy operation, 0.69<br>
kcal/g-mole.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Second point: I don't know if "energy" is entirely the right</i><br>
<i>&gt;concept.  As I remember, reactions are thermodynamically favored if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;free energy of the reaction is negative:</i><br>
<i>&gt;dG= dH - T*dS</i><br>
<i>&gt;G being free energy, H being enthalpy, T being temperature, and S being</i><br>
<i>&gt;entropy.  </i><br>
<p>
T dS is usually about 10% as large as dH at room temp.  However, if it would<br>
make you feel better, we can calculate it (with the help of the Handbook of<br>
Chemistry and Physics). <br>
<p>
You're forgetting all the water vapor that gets thrown off.  The entropy of<br>
gases is immensely higher than that of solids.  The reaction <br>
<p>
C6H12 + 3 O2 -&gt; 6 C + 6 H2O <br>
<p>
has a net entropy *gain* of 49 e.u. because it absorbs three moles of gas<br>
and releases six moles of gas.  (I will treat living things as if they were<br>
made out of a typical liquid hydrocarbon, C6H12.)  This makes the reaction<br>
that much faster than if no entropy gain were involved.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think I can safely say that diamond has a lower entropy than</i><br>
<i>&gt;coal, meaning dG would be more positive, and less likely to happen.</i><br>
<p>
The difference between diamond and graphite is a smidgenly 0.8 e.u.  I don't<br>
think coal can be much higher entropy than graphite.<br>
