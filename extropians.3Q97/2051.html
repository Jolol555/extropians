&lt;All the really good discussions of "complexity" I've seen on this<br>
list seem to point toward a developing taxonomy of different types of<br>
complexity. There are several different competing definitions, and<br>
like the three definitions of "heat" they may all be right. That means<br>
each one of them will need a name of its own, so we can stop<br>
inadvertently confusing them, and if we can't agree which one is the<br>
"real" complexity, it may very well turn out that complexity is as<br>
chimerical as caloric, a half-baked idea that has played its role in<br>
the history of science to date, but, turning out to have no referent,<br>
must now be discarded.&gt;<br>
<p>
I’m not mathematically inclined enough (either), to debate the margins<br>
of each type of complexity mentioned previously but suspect that they<br>
might hinge on structural, contextual or communication, and functional<br>
differences.<br>

Eliezer and JKC have recently dissected different ‘types’ of emotions<br>
quite nicely. Your line of reasoning might also be applied to another<br>
abused concept, namely consciousness.  This is what Ned Block does in<br>
his essay "On A Confusion About A Function Of Consciousness" at<br>
<a href="http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/bbs/Archive/bbs.block.html">http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/bbs/Archive/bbs.block.html</a> from which I<br>
quote:<br>
<p>
&lt;The concept of consciousness is a hybrid or better, a mongrel<br>
concept: the word `consciousness' connotes a number of different<br>
concepts and denotes a number of different phenomena. We reason about<br>
"consciousness" using some premises that apply to one of the phenomena<br>
that fall under "consciousness", other premises that apply to other<br>
"consciousnesses" and we end up with trouble. There are many parallels<br>
in the history of science. Aristotle used `velocity' sometimes to mean<br>
average velocity and sometimes to mean instantaneous velocity; his<br>
failure to see the distinction caused confusion (Kuhn, 1964). The<br>
Florentine Experimenters of the 17th Century used a single word<br>
(roughly translatable as "degree of heat") for temperature and for<br>
heat, generating paradoxes. [Snip] These are very different cases, but<br>
there is a similarity, one that they share with the case of<br>
`consciousness'. The similarity is: very different concepts are<br>
treated as a single concept. I think we all have some tendency to make<br>
this mistake in the case of "consciousness".&gt;<br>
