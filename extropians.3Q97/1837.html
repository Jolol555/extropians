     The stereotype of emotionless machines, therefore, is misplaced on<br>
     technological grounds.  We might - I say *might* - be able to divorce <br>
     the emotional processes from the rational, and deliberately build <br>
     emotionless machines.  Perhaps not.  The emotions started out as <br>
     instincts; they are probably the single longest-evolved part of the <br>
     brain.  So they might be so simple and physiological - so directly <br>
     programmed - as to be easily untangled.  Or they might act as a <br>
     coordination center for the rest of the brain.  It could go either <br>
     way; probably both.<br>

     As for me, I only want my computer to emote when it is reading to me.  <br>
     I already have a screen saver "Pet" that gets forlorn when it is not <br>
     paid attention to.  I get defensive of it when people play roughly <br>
     with it...AND IT'S A PROGRAM!  A cartoon dog with some interesting <br>
     tricks.  I don't want to devote one iota of emotion catering to a <br>
     desk-bound lonely CPU! &lt;G&gt;  I have enough human CPUs and their stuff <br>
     to deal with.  So, like in Star Trek:First Contact, if we can just ask <br>
     our emotional machines to switch off emotion when we deem it <br>
     convenient, that would be great.  Matter of fact, if we could get our <br>
     partners to do that...just kidding..<br>
