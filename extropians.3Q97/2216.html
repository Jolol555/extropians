<i>&gt; One of the many thought-provoking things Bettelheim says is</i><br>

<i>&gt; That makes it more clear for me why stories about powerful people--</i><br>

<i>&gt; _Air Force One_, are so popular.  "Get off my plane!" says Mr. Prez in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the trailer for that one, and I understand him to mean symbolically:</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Get out of my life, disorder!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I worry that in this *particular* example it may mean instead to most<br>
grownups present: I'm tired of trying to figure out how the world works<br>
these days, give me back the Evil Empire to hate in a straightforward<br>
manner, rather than this unimaginably complicated and shifting brew of<br>
powers and meanings and values I'm drowning in.  Wait, maybe that *is*<br>
just a version of "Get out of my life, disorder!"  Problem is, that<br>
"disorder" is here to stay, a vague premonition, perhaps, of what's to<br>
come...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Although I reject centralized power as a way to run one's mind, and in</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact I've always been turned off by some libertarians' (IMHO) over-</i><br>
<i>&gt; emphasis on logic and rationality, still I have a lot more sympathy for</i><br>
<i>&gt; this symbolism (autocrat = autonomy) than I do for plain power worship.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In some sense we are *rightly* enraptured by power.  It's an essential</i><br>
<i>&gt; nutrient.</i><br>
<p>
For one thing, one distinguishes the "absolute power" that corrupts<br>
absolutely from, say, the attractive "empowerment" of the decent and the<br>
downtrodden.  It's not always so easy to flesh out the distinction though. <br>
And I agree that taking responsibility for oneself is necessary, and<br>
finding one's way to some kind of autonomy is agreeable as well.  But I<br>
find the idea of self-ownership can also be misleading in certain<br>
interpretations.  No less a champion of strong wills and strong selves<br>
than Nietzsche expressed ambivalences on this score that trouble me a lot. <br>
Can there be a sense of "taking responsibility" which would have us assume<br>
a falsely exhaustive sense of authorship over the details of our lives and<br>
characters, one that plays to interests other than our own?  The process<br>
of self-creation is importantly a process of selectivity and style, and<br>
it's crucial to *own* one's choices.  0ne way of *disowning* them is to<br>
pretend there's no choice involved, to pretend that people who are<br>
different than you are unworthy of emulation rather than simply on<br>
different paths of self-creation.  For the most part, I imagine there's a<br>
lot to be learned from *everyone* and that when I choose one over the<br>
other -- something I do all the time, and with a certain joy -- I am<br>
*losing* something as well as *gaining* something.  However, when<br>
self-ownership is taken to mean instead that I imagine myself the sole<br>
author of my destiny, I think this is a recipe for some disastrously<br>
paralyzing guilt.  Let's leave that stuff to the Catholic Church and the<br>
Ayn Rand Institute. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; "Surely" (Dale, I love that word; I want to use it, too!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; power is fractal--having details and concentrations at different levels</i><br>
<i>&gt; and scales--like everything else.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Trouble is, we often think of power as functioning repressively rather<br>
than productively, as issuing from secure and central intentions rather<br>
than emerging in a more complicated way -- hence it pays to remind<br>
ourselves of these things.  Btw, would it reassure you to hear that<br>
whenever I say "surely" my voice lilts up into a question-mark? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;*Neither* the idea that the market, say, emerges in consequence of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;best-possible interaction of sovereign rationally calculating homo </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;economici in a free-flow of unimpeded information, </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Just because economists use simplified models doesn't mean they think </i><br>
<i>&gt; the world is perfect or simple!  Like point masses in perfect vacuum, </i><br>
<i>&gt; perfect economic actors in a perfect economic fluid are easier to </i><br>
<i>&gt; analyze, that's all.  There are also analyses of perfectly stupid&amp; </i><br>
<i>&gt; gnorant actors, and analyses of "transaction costs" (=messiness) abound.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;*nor* the idea that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;market is governed and manipulated by an all or even mostly powerful </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;monolithic ruling class -- however comforting these ideas may be in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;face of more troubling facts -- comes closeto capturing the unholy mess </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of the ways in which desire, knowledge, and force fling themselves around </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the globe here and now and from here on out.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree that visions of central control (whether by individuals, </i><br>
<i>&gt; governments, conspiracies, ideas, markets...), even when described with </i><br>
<i>&gt; horror, are often the result of a kind of romance with power.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Both of your points are well-taken.  I was sketching two descriptive poles<br>
that exert a rhetorical influence on our formulations even if neither<br>
appeared often in their extreme forms.  Surely -- ahem -- they don't often<br>
appear in their extreme forms in a forum so careful in its formulations as<br>
this one, but in general I do think conceptions of power tend to be<br>
governed by the figures of the invisible hand of spontaneous order, the<br>
hidden hand of conspiracy, or the heavy hand of state. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But I wouldn't romanticize a vision of *de*centeredness.  </i><br>
<p>
It's true I may stray into this from time to time.  Still, the opposite<br>
temptation seems to me more common and more urgent in its trouble-making<br>
potential.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, I don't get what Power, with a capital P as</i><br>
<i>&gt; Foucault used it, means if not central power.  He seemed to mean something</i><br>
<i>&gt; other than the everyday power we all use to move about in the world.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
A dissertation, not a post.  Suffice it to say that Foucault was convinced<br>
that repressive and central/sovereign conceptions of the operations of<br>
power were grossly inadequate to "the everyday power we all use to move<br>
about in the world" and sought out better explanations.  Specifically, he<br>
seemed to mean by power an emergent property of the sum of interactions<br>
among people calculating to gain advantage from/with/over one another.<br>
Institutions, intelligible values, social scripts arise out of these<br>
interactions, and they facilitate these calculations and in turn are<br>
fortified in their existence by the fact that they are made-recourse-to,<br>
cited, reiterated in practice.  But no citation is perfect, and the string<br>
of citations plots a path of transformations -- a subversive citation may<br>
be strategically more useful than a more "faithful" one in some<br>
circumstances.  Sometimes Foucault seemed to figure this emergent property<br>
as a hopelessly complex dynamic system -- like the market is, or an<br>
ecosystem; and sometimes he seemed to figure it more as a resevoir of<br>
force, of capacity-to-effect-change-in-the-world, that people dip into,<br>
stir up, make use of.  Best, Dale<br>
