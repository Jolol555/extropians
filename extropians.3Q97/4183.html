Yes, that was pointed out to me by Kennita as well, but it is not<br>
my intention to manipulate people into doing what I want--it is my<br>
intention to express my ideas honestly and plainly.  Yes, being <br>
nice might be better at winning converts to a cause, but it is less<br>
likely to result in open, honest, valuable debate. <br>
<p>
Of what value is praise if one never uses insult?  It's like the<br>
visitor who tells you your house looks nice every time ey visits;<br>
you know ey says it every time, no matter what, so it is utterly<br>
meaningless.  I much prefer a real friend who says "your house is<br>
a mess, Lee", in a friendly--but honest--way.  That can be done in<br>
a jovial, loving way, but it also conveys useful information in<br>
a way that perfunctory courtesy does not.<br>
