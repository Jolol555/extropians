<p>
Maybe you should say: "why we mistrust *our* governement"<br>
The interesting question (If you want this to stop) surely becomes: Why you<br>
need a BATF (some sort of SWAT-team I suspect) so much in the first place?<br>
In the last ten years or so there has been only 1 accidental death of a<br>
civilian by a Special Arrest Team over here. That's not because our police<br>
force consists of supermen (they only wish ;-) but because the SAT's over<br>
here are very seldom needed. If a policeman fires his pistol it's most<br>
often national news. I'm pretty sure this was discussed before and I'm<br>
sorry if I'm repeating myself, please bear with me.<br>
<p>
Can you imagine that our Prime Minister (sort of like The President in the<br>
US) lives in a normal house among ordinary citizens and goes to work on his<br>
bicycle, alone, without a single bodyguard, everyday? Even if it rains? ;-)<br>
And there's no reason why he should not. Last time a Dutch polititian was<br>
shot at in-the-line of duty was in the 17th century to the best of my<br>
knowledge. We had a terrorist drama in 1972 that ended with much violence<br>
(3 dead civilans and all seven or so terrorists dead). It's still being<br>
talked about today, it's *that* special.<br>
<p>
We have 'big' governement, it spends a lot of money (almost 50% of GNP), it<br>
makes mistakes (they *are* human). I can think of many reasons to be<br>
critical toward them, some quite personal. But I have no reason to mistrust<br>
them in the sense that they are 'out to get me' or have big hidden agenda's.<br>
<p>
The last governement made a really big mistake about elderly-care and were<br>
promply voted out-of-office. The newly installed govenement corrected it<br>
and went on with it's program. They have done very well in the last few<br>
years. Holland is now the most healty economy of the EC, and one of the<br>
best coutry's in the world to invest in, because of it's stability,<br>
according to a recent survey. This in spite of the somewhat restrictive<br>
laws (very high minimum wages, stringent environmental laws and so on...).<br>
Big governement does not neccesary lead to economic collapse, we seem to be<br>
doing OK.<br>
I'm pretty sure I'll vote for another term of the current cabinet.<br>
<p>
Call me a nationalist if all this irritates you, but when I read your posts<br>
about all the violence going on in the US I just can not help thinking our<br>
governement is doing something right. I'm not saying Holland (or it's<br>
populace, or it's political system) is 'better'. It's not, just different.<br>
But maybe we could learn from each other. Please consider that. if we can<br>
do it so can you.<br>

Here we have something we agree on very much methinks (albeit from<br>
different perspectives ;-). Are you familiar with the Dutch drugs-policy?<br>
It's not without problems but vey few people get killed (either by the<br>
drugs themselves or police). I think that's a good measurament of the<br>
quality of any policy. Holland would like to legalize more drugs (marijuana<br>
is already legal for practical purposes) but other EC-countries are<br>
opposing this right now. Even though every research organisation in Europe<br>
(and some the US) investigating the effectiveness of drugs-policy's hails<br>
Dutch policy as beeing the most humane to *all* victims.<br>
<p>
I don't want to start another thread on gun-ownership or how much money<br>
should be spent on 'social issues' , I don't think we'll agree on that in<br>
this millenium. That's OK. But would you please *consider* that the way<br>
things are arranged over here could work (do work here!). The average<br>
income in the US is higher then in Holland. Maybe America could learn<br>
something from Holland when it comes to certain aspect of crime-control, we<br>
sure could learn from your deciveness and ability to innovate (something we<br>
lack in seriously at times). Holland has lost every war it has fought in<br>
the last 200 years, three (one of wich was really not a war but a<br>
de-colonisation mess). here we can learn from you, should it ever become<br>
necessary again.<br>
<p>
Most Respectfully,<br>
<p>
