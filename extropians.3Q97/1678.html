Well not exactly why the west has won...but since others have been veering<br>
off the subject a little and got to talking aboutl the transition from hunter<br>
gatherers to agriculture I thought I'd throw in my two cents worth. It's very<br>
simple...really.<br>
<p>
Beer.<br>
<p>
Back during the hunter-gatherer days it was great to be  young male or<br>
pre-pubescent female.  They did for a living what executives pay a bundle to<br>
do today.  Hunt and fish all day...lay around and tell lies at night.<br>
<p>
For the women and old folks it wasn't such a good deal....pregnant women...or<br>
women with young kids..couldn't hunt...so they were relegated to other<br>
tasks....gathering. .... and cooking. Thence they became that era's experts<br>
on plants.....and chemistry.<br>
<p>
So one day some genius developed beer.  Might have been an accident...but<br>
beer is pretty low-tech.  <br>
<p>
And the rest was history.  The men LIKED beer.  But there's a problem.  It<br>
doesn't go good with a nomadic lifestyle.  Gotta stay in one place and grow<br>
the hops and grains and like that. <br>
<p>
 OKAY!   we can do that!....thence agriculture was born.<br>
