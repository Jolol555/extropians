<i>&gt;   &gt;  "The following massive rant is meant for all those questioning the</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;  idea of meme supremacy (some memes are [a lot] better than</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt; others and one is the best [for all people, eventhough they may</i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;  not understand this yet]"</i><br>
<i>&gt;      </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Answer me this Mr Otter... the following concept is / is not the</i><br>
basis <br>
<i>&gt;      for the scientific method: any idea, however attractive, is rejected</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      in the face of proof of it's falsity - ie: NO IDEA IS SACRED. </i><br>
<i>&gt;      </i><br>
Except, maybe...the idea that no idea is sacred :))) You obviously seem to<br>
think that this idea, this *meme*, is the most important one there is. It<br>
is<br>
*better* than other ideas like "the eternal unquestionable values of<br>
[...]",<br>
this idea of yours sure beats the rest [blah, blah, blah etc.] You sir, are<br>
a closet<br>
MEME SUPREMACIST...shame on you and all your goats and camels!<br>
<p>
Btw, I agree. You've hit the nail on da head. This is the supreme meme<br>
itself:<br>
reject falsity, always look for improvement. Apart from this, there are<br>
perfectly<br>
logical and practical supreme society ethics [memes] like "don't harm<br>
anyone who doesn't harm you". The Extropian Principles are (almost exactly)<br>
the master meme [complex]. Go figure.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, in my fine rant I have already explained why certain memes are<br>
better than others. Memes that don't actively seek maximal life extension<br>
trough *scientific* means will ultimately *always* kill the host [by<br>
definition].<br>
Transhumanistic memes give their host at least a fighting chance to attain<br>
immortality (through lots of research and other hard work, not by wasting<br>
time<br>
on prayer or something like that). Deep inside all people just want to be<br>
happy<br>
and [thus] *alive*. The "master meme" is supreme because, as explained in<br>
my<br>
rant, it is the *only one* that, by using your [duly] much acclaimed<br>
scientific<br>
principles, may lead to a future paradise of freedom, knowledge, happiness<br>
and<br>
eternal life.<br>
<p>
Snipped the rest, since it basically  was a collection of variations on<br>
your "there's no meme supremacy/"scientifically" not possible theme. This<br>
has<br>
now been proven wrong, so, for the sake of consequence, you will now drop<br>
your defective ideas...although you *never know* with obsessive folks...<br>
Where does it hurt?<br>
      <br>
                                         <br>
