  In my plans for immortality, I am trying to assess the viablilty of brain<br>
transplantation.  Within a few months, if not already, I will be able to make<br>
 clones of myself from, say, an epithelial cell.  I can pay some, or many women<br>
in any of many nations to bear and rear my son(s).  In 20 years, when I am<br>
dying of cancer, or some new disorder which hasn't yet been cured, will I be<br>
any better off?  Even in the best scenario, where a universal nanomachine has<br>
been constructed, disease mechanisms and pathways will not be elucidated<br>
overnight. Cures will likely require a great deal of NP protein conformational<br>
analysis &amp; simulation, which even MP nanocomputers will hardly speed up.<br>
 Uploading has the same problem with the research time required to figure out<br>
what makes a neuron tick.  Cryogenics is an iffy procedure where information is<br>
lost in the process (it might be in a slightly better state 20 years from now).<br>
 But, say I were able to track down one of those 20 year old clones growing up<br>
in South America.<br>
  All a brain really needs to keep functioning is a good blood supply?  Surely<br>
it is within today's surgical technique to be able to route a few of my son's<br>
arteries to those going to my brain?  Nerve grafts don't sound as easy, but<br>
really aren't necessary.  I would be willing to keep my brain activity going,<br>
albeit in some monstous pit of hell without senses, to be able to hold out<br>
another 50 years until a cure for my disease or a new host can be found.  I<br>
imagine it as a sort of Zaphod-Beeblebrox arrangement, but my head would<br>
probably be hanging limp while my son's head appeared normal.  As long as I<br>
wasn't dying from a brain disease, my son's blood, et al should keep me alive<br>
without worries of rejection, etc.  Although, might my cancer be contagious to<br>
a clone?<br>
  OK, so assuming the the medical technique is practical, what will it take to<br>
get my son to agree to the surgery?  We would be family, but a monetary<br>
incentive might be necessary.  What about the legal issues involved here?  What<br>
would be a good nation for my son to have citizenship in?  (yes,<br>
diversification would be a good idea).  What about if I made a clone of myself,<br>
made it sign a contract, then gave it a lobotomy so it couldn't back out?<br>
 Screw ethics when its my longevity at stake.<br>
  Anybody know of any good cloning labs?<br>
