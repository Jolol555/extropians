<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;Are right and left anarchism really opposite ideologies ? sometimes, there</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;can be a fruitful collaboration. The best example, IMO, is the GNU project,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;a pure anarcho-socialist project (no property of information!) which gave</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;birth to successful companies such as Cygnus.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;        I have always disliked the whole idea of "left" and "right" in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;politics (or non-politics, as it may be.)  By saying that one is "left</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;wing" it gives the impression that the person in question has *only* left</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;wing tendencies when they may possess many "right wing" qualities as well.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The Advocates for Self-Government has a somewhat more effective (IMO)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;method by dividing a chart into five different political sections then</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;asking key questions to position one on the chart.  Although this may be an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;improvement to the conventional left\right scale, it still leaves much to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be desired.  Probably the easiest way to find someone's views in politics</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is to simply ask their opinion on the purpose of government and why.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By asking if the someone can ever justify stealing for any reason, and they</i><br>
<i>&gt; answer "yes", you can guess on which end of the Nolan Chart,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.self-gov.org/quiz.html">http://www.self-gov.org/quiz.html</a>&gt;, (Top or Bottom) they should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; catagorized in.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (and if ya even wanna waste time talkin' to 'um)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I dunno. I recall that Heinlein, a free thinking libertarian if there<br>
ever was one, stated that if it came down to him stealing or his kids<br>
starving, he'd steal in a heartbeat.<br>
<p>
I can easily imagine a scenario where a die hard anarcho-libertarian<br>
would steal: If he/she were stuck in a country with no means of escape,<br>
where his or her ability to earn a living was restricted by the<br>
authorities because of his or her political beleifs.<br>
<p>
People live by the ethics they can afford.<br>
