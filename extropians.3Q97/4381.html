"Neuro-semantic" represents a technical term used in a particular<br>
study called "general semantics."  The term dates from at least<br>
1933.  It gets used in some studies of linguistics and psychology,<br>
when those studies derive, in part, from general semantics.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, E-prime, mentioned on the web-site as relevant to<br>
extropianism, derives directly from general semantics.  David<br>
Bourland, the person who developed E-prime, currently serves as a<br>
Vice President of the International Society for General Semantics.<br>
<p>
I do not suggest that extropianism has a close association with<br>
g.s., but do point out at least some common subset.  I also point<br>
out that many people on this list may have experienced some<br>
experience with g.s. from the fairly popular text "Language in<br>
Thought and Action" by S.I. Hayakawa;  that book often serves as<br>
required reading in "critical thinking" courses in colleges.<br>
Another place where people may have run into some popularizations<br>
of g.s. comes from the work of Science Fiction writer Robert<br>
Heinlein -- something perhaps relevant in the context of a current<br>
thread related to Starship Troopers.<br>
<p>
As a technical term, you have no particular reason to have any<br>
familiarity with "neuro-semantic," any more than you would have a<br>
reason to know what "curl" or "convolution" mean in the context of<br>
mathematics, or to know "uncertainty" or "charm" in the context of<br>
physics.<br>
