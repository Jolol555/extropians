     Hi all,<br>
     <br>
     I'm assimilating a glossary of terms relative to the concept of <br>
     singularity.  It is some research for a story.  Also, pointers to <br>
     previous editions of Extropian digest that might have pertinent info <br>
     would be beneficial.<br>
     <br>
     I've seen the term "Fermi Paradox" battered around but I'd like more <br>
     information.  I'll be surfing and researching on this this evening.<br>
     <br>
     Ultimately, I'd like to provide a story that could be made into film <br>
     that has the optimistic impact of "Contact" and not promote the scare <br>
     tactics of oldies like "Colossus: The Forbin Project" or newer ones <br>
     like "The Web" or (gag!) "Virtuosity" just because the <br>
     artistically-deprived and generally bored people of our culture will <br>
     lap up anything that has a few moments of dazzle, suspense or <br>
     intrigue, even if the bulk of the offering is laden with predictable <br>
     outcomes, black "plot" holes and generally require wild suspension of <br>
     disbelief merely to enjoy the 1.5 to 2 hours.  <br>
     <br>
     Cultural prep work is needed for a singularity to occur if it is to <br>
     occur at all.  More people see movies than ever.  Likely because the <br>
     medium of film is a quicker assimilation of information (however <br>
     tweaked a form it may come in).  That's the direction I'm compelled to <br>
     go in.<br>
     <br>
     Hope to hear from some of you...<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
