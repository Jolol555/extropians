I think that, compared to what I have seen on other listserves, this one's <br>
reaction to the Adrian Karth bounce problem has been remarkably <br>
restrained and focused on solutions.  I don't think Sarah's brief <br>
expression of (severe) annoyance detracts from that--most of us know each <br>
other well enough by now to allow for the occasional outbust.  If <br>
Paul is indeed new to the list and does not know Sarah very well, I <br>
hope that he will accept her apology and use the opportunity to make <br>
her acquaintance.<br>
<p>
At the same time, this is not a small problem, it can shut down a listserve, <br>
and it can used as a form of sabatoge.  Again, I appreciate Eliezer's <br>
and others' efforts to track the source of the problem and correct it as <br>
soon as possible.  I hope that we will find that this was all a <br>
software glitch.<br>
