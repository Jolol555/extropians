<p>
The larynxes themselves are not fossilized, but the other bones put<br>
constraints on the shape and directions of the air passages (especially once<br>
you take into account muscles, which can often have their shapes and sizes<br>
inferred from attachments).  This apparently leaves no room for a larynz<br>
unless it folded back on itself in a peculiar way.  I think this is related<br>
to Neanderthal's enormous nasal turbinates.  Also, the hyoid bone help shape<br>
the larynx; I can't tell you whether Neanderthals lacked it or had a<br>
different shape.<br>
<p>
The point is still somewhat under dispute, because, as you surmise, it's hard<br>
to be definitive about soft tissue when you just have bones.<br>
