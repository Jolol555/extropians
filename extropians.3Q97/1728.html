           <br>
<p>
So as I understand it, everybody could vote for anybody and the top 500 vote <br>
getters are elected. You can be certain that sports heroes, game show hosts <br>
and soap opera actors would be in this select group, even if they didn't want <br>
to be and had no wish to be in the legislature. Also, you can forget about <br>
the secret ballet, who voted for who would have to be a matter of public<br>
record so they'd know where to send the bill to in case your man makes a fool <br>
of himself and actually votes for something. Lots of people would get tired <br>
of paying for things their fool representative did years ago, and feel <br>
resentment knowing that their neighbor doesn't pay a dime, they'd move,  <br>
change their name and disappear, even more would refuse to vote at all. <br>
If I was forced to vote I'd vote for myself because I'd know I wouldn't win, <br>
or I'd go for a Casper Milktoast who vowed to collect his salary, sit on his <br>
ass and not do one damn thing.<br>

Absolutely true, no more spending of any kind. Come to think of it, your idea <br>
isn't so bad after all.                                <br>
