I don't know about the spare time business.  Hunter-gatherer societies have<br>
lots of free time.  I think the increase in population (hence, more computing<br>
power) is far more significant.  I think that continues today, and that a<br>
significant part of current development is due to bringing ever-larger<br>
numbers of people into our market and science systems.<br>

<p>
Up to the invention of gunpowder, the most powerful armies were those of the<br>
Central Asian pastoralists.  Long term food surpluses can take<br>
non-agricultural form; they used grazing animals, which had the distinct<br>
advantage of moving themselves.  <br>
