     ...every minor detail is a major decision.  Have to keep things in <br>
     scale, have to hold to your vision..."<br>

     Thanks for the insight.  I heaved a big sigh when Geoff took me to <br>
     task to further distinguish art (me being so "liberal artsy" and all).<br>
     <br>
     Let's hear it again...<br>

     If you can't tell the difference, and you prove it with a lot of <br>
     capitalized letters, you're a "liberal arts" mentality.  If you say, <br>
     "Yeah, I see that people can be divided into these two groups, and it <br>
     has predictive value, so I don't care about the philosophical reasons <br>
     why they're really the same"...then you're an engineer.<br>
