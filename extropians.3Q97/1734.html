The issue at hand is whether Extropian ideas are so obviously, so surely<br>
right, that we should override the free will of dissenters.<br>
<p>
The answer, as any individualist knows, is "No."  I, personally, have stated,<br>
on this list, that I wouldn't dare override the will of actual schizophrenics.<br>
 That is, even if I *know* for a neurological *fact* that somebody is<br>
incompetent, I still would respect their free will, as long as they didn't try<br>
to shoot me or something.<br>
<p>
Many religious persons throughout the ages, sincerely and utterly convinced<br>
that they were acting to preserve the immortal souls of others - as you would,<br>
with cryonics - were responsible for pain, torture, and the retardation of<br>
knowledge and civilization.  You can't say, "Well, *I* am right."  The Law<br>
that governs our actions within a social context - ethics, morality, game<br>
theory, whatever - cannot refer to actual reality, only our perceptions of<br>
reality.  Because when we have to make a decision, we know what we think; we<br>
don't know what is.<br>
<p>
I'm sure that a lot of people will resent my comparing cryonics to a religion.<br>
 Well, I'm not.  I'm just saying that, even if you are *certain* that cryonics<br>
is Right, this *still* does not entitle you to override someone's will.  You<br>
have to respect the surety of others, or they will be just as sure that<br>
cryonics is the Work of Satan and will - with exactly as much justification,<br>
no more, no less - smash your liquid nitrogen tanks and free the trapped and<br>
frozen souls.  Surety gives not the right of Command.  Hence the phrase,<br>
"informed consent".<br>
<p>
Perhaps I'm something of an extremist on the subject.  I need to be.  Being a<br>
mutant(*) with strange mental powers and all, you can imagine the depths of<br>
catastrophe that would result if I decided that my "superior intelligence"<br>
entitled me to Mastery.  The day I draw a line that separates humanity into<br>
"responsible" and "irresponsible" adults, I just *know* I'm going to wind up<br>
alone on one side.  So I draw no line.<br>
(* Usual caveats about how, for all I know, it's postnatal or teratogenic.)<br>
<p>
Nor is this a condescending allowance.  I truly respect the rights and<br>
opinions of others, and genuinely, deeply, and emotionally believe that They<br>
may be right, and I wrong.  Over and *over* and OVER, throughout history,<br>
people have been mistaken.  Humans are built for surety in their Cause;<br>
doubters got demoted.  So we can never, ever, trust our surety.  Indeed,<br>
trusting your surety is a sign that there's a hell of a lot you don't know<br>
about human nature, and that you probably *are* wrong.<br>
<p>
In fact, my mutant status really has nothing to do with it.  Anybody who makes<br>
the basic error of surety is going to wind up alone on the "responsible" side<br>
of the line, or - at best - in a small and select group of people who exactly<br>
share opinions.  My genuine statistical improbability simply means that the<br>
group size would be small, with a corresponding lack of stabilization, and<br>
descent into megalomania.  Thus, as I stated, I can't afford to make that<br>
basic error, because the consequences to me would be exacerbated, and hard to repair.<br>
<p>
Anyway.  As I said once to Dr. Hugo de Garis - who used much the same<br>
arguments, except targeted at females - the trouble with declaring your group<br>
superior is that "your group" doesn't necessarily include *you*.  In fact,<br>
just being silly enough to start drawing lines like that excludes you from the Masters.<br>
<p>
It's a very contagious meme, "knowing better".  We're built to be infected by<br>
it.  I tossed out a couple of antibodies at<br>
<a href="http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/FOD.html">http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/FOD.html</a> in an effort to present a clean bill of<br>
memetic health... but the meme lives on, and will continue until I finally get<br>
my hands on the source code for human nature.  Speaking of which, back to work.<br>
