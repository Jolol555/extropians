<p>
Well, my decision is based more on monkey see monkey do than any<br>
in-depth analysis. There are indeed such achives at cryonet, which <br>
I read a couple years ago. They go into some detail on the various<br>
squabblings and fallings-out, which didn't interest me.<br>
I do admire the heroism displayed in the Dora Kent affair, like the <br>
people at Alcor, and feel they have a size advantage. The facility is <br>
also not more than 3 hrs air time from Seattle or San Jose.<br>

<i>&gt;	Forrest, thanks for the exciting summary of your Extro-3</i><br>
<i>&gt;experience. </i><br>
<p>
Hmmm, I wish I'd received more feedback, as it is rapidly slipping <br>
into the distant past...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can't miss this next year.</i><br>
<p>
??Next year?? Who said anything about next year? <br>
Seriously, I think the planning for EXTRO 4 should commence now.<br>
