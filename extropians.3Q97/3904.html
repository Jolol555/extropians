Hardly. It's the _result_ of thinking, after observation and analysis. It's<br>
called a judgement.<br>
That said, I apologize if I unintentionally offended.<br>

Interesting. How did you come to these conclusions? You mad a bold<br>
assertion a little while ago--I responded to that. I haven't seen your<br>
reply. We may be arguing past each other. I'm especially unclear what this<br>
"gods" stuff is all about. If we can stop sniping long enough, perhaps<br>
you'll detail your complaints.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I can see why you would have such a problem</i><br>
<i>&gt;with Rand.</i><br>
<p>
Did I say I had a problem with Rand? I was exposed to a good deal of<br>
jabbering by insincere neocheaters-in-Randite-clothing in college; I had a<br>
problem with _them_. I can get along with Randites. I thought the Zon site<br>
was funny because I hoped it would *work* on the target audience. <br>
<p>
There are worse philosophies. I suspect Ms. Rand developed her philosophy<br>
as a reaction to her early years, and as "lifeboat rules", hers have a<br>
great deal more dignity than most.<br>
But I'm not on a lifeboat at the moment. If you are, rock on.<br>
