As I seem to recall, in the dim mists of antiquity (1970s) I got from a book<br>
co-authored by Chandrasekhar (yes, the "Chandrasekhar's limit" Chandrasekhar) <br>
the story as follows: <br>
<p>
What are called Population I stars (that might be a Roman numeral, I forget) <br>
are the products of *two* supernovae, and they and their planets are the <br>
loci for concentrations of heavy atoms. As I understand it, the posited <br>
fusion processes in a "fresh" (H-He) star going nova can only get you to <br>
something like Calcium or Silicon. Those elements, present during a <br>
*second* supernova event, can get transmuted "up the hump" of binding energy <br>
to yield the heavy stuff, even all the way to transuranics.<br>
<p>
Paradoxically, given the names, Pop I stars are *older* than Pop II stars.<br>
<p>
If this is still an accepted model, then any civilization developing on <br>
a Pop II star's planet *might* have a hard time discovering/developing <br>
nuclear physics &amp; tech. If they don't have very much metal in their planet's <br>
crust, they *might* not get past the pottery stage. Poul Anderson used <br>
this as a plot element at least once.<br>
<p>
So we might be the first race with the wherewithal to get off their rock.<br>
Wait for the elder race? No time for that, they might be us...<br>
<p>
Like Eric, I don't really know what the current story is. <br>
Maybe Carl F has a clue?<br>

<i>&gt;Well, I've been trying to look into this, although I'm hampered by my lack</i><br>
<i>&gt;of expertise in astrophysics. The Solar system formed about five billion</i><br>
<i>&gt;years ago. One of the reasons that life could form here is that the cloud</i><br>

<i>&gt;Bang (if that's what happened) produced only hydrogen and helium, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;happened only some seven to thirteen billion years before the formation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Solar system. It would take a certain amount of time for enough large</i><br>
<i>&gt;stars to form and go supernova to enrich the interstellar clouds of our</i><br>
<i>&gt;galaxy with the oxygen and carbon that were available at the time the Solar</i><br>
<i>&gt;system formed. When I try to answer the question "How much time at a</i><br>
<i>&gt;minimum would be required to form and disperse the necessary amount of</i><br>
<i>&gt;heavier elements?" I find I get led into astrophysics textbooks and papers</i><br>
<i>&gt;that are too hairy for me to understand without devoting a lot of time to</i><br>
<i>&gt;it, and they don't present "the Answer" to this question in the abstracts</i><br>
<i>&gt;or conclusions from which a layperson could easily grab it. So to me, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;seems like an open queston. If anyone can close it for me, I'd appreciate</i><br>
<i>&gt;it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the meantime, though, it seems entirely possible to me that we just </i><br>
