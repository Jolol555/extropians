Abstract<br>
<p>
Using cross-sectional time-series data for U.S. counties<br>
from 1977 to 1992, we find that allowing citizens to carry<br>
concealed weapons deters violent crimes and it appears to<br>
produce no increase in accidental deaths. If those states<br>
which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions<br>
had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177<br>
rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults would have been<br>
avoided yearly. On the other hand, consistent with the<br>
notion of criminals responding to incentives, we find<br>
criminals substituting into property crimes involving<br>
stealth and where the probabilities of contact between the<br>
criminal and the victim are minimal. The largest population<br>
counties where the deterrence effect on violent crimes is<br>
greatest are where the substitution effect into property<br>
crimes is highest. Concealed handguns also have their<br>
greatest deterrent effect in the highest crime counties.<br>
Higher arrest and conviction rates consistently and<br>
dramatically reduce the crime rate. Consistent with other<br>
recent work (Lott, 1992b), the results imply that increasing<br>
the arrest rate, independent of the probability of eventual<br>
conviction, imposes a significant penalty on criminals. The<br>
estimated annual gain from allowing concealed handguns is at<br>
least $6.214 billion.<br>
