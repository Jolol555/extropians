This is assuming the old and tired and outdated mythic assumption that art<br>
is subjective is accurate; and the inaccuracy of this has been disproved<br>
time and time again on this list by artist themselves as well as those who<br>
have spent the time to learn about art and study its disciplines. Granted,<br>
the creativity of art may need no reason nor conclusion nor to prove a point<br>
if that is its aim.  Contrarily, it can also prove a point, make certain,<br>
and be used to convince. Thus, to claim the creativity of art has no<br>
justification could place it in the same camp as pseudo science which<br>
lessens the very values of art. Thins brings to mind the question of the<br>
integrity of art.  If we claim concepts, tangible or otherwise, to be state<br>
of the art, then it is not in the camp of pseudo science.  If we even claim<br>
that our art has no assemblage of conclusion or purpose, it is still not in<br>
the camp of pseudo science by its very essence.<br>
<p>
Nonetheless, your art and your creativity, Wax, might be without<br>
justification, but you might want to question why.<br>
