     I've got two points of curiosity and would like to hear from any <br>
     researchers (official or other) about:<br>
     <br>
     Eidetic Imaging:<br>
     <br>
     A kind of heightened mental visualisation. From my limited reading and <br>
     intermittent experience it can be described as the moment where mental <br>
     images cease to be voluntary and tenuous and suddenly begin to paint <br>
     themselves into sharper, intense and more luminous detail so that the <br>
     image or series of images seem very suddenly to be more experienced <br>
     than imagined. So suddenly that I wonder what threshold is being <br>
     passed: chemical, electrical? Or whether this is simply a matter of a <br>
     rapid re organization of consciousness into a kind of extreme inner <br>
     subjectivity?<br>
     <br>
     In case you're wondering this is not neccesarily a psychedelic nor <br>
     schizophrenic meandering. My first and so far only prolonged <br>
     experience of this sort of thing was way before ingesting anything so <br>
     tasty. It has been documented that children experience this more than <br>
     adults.<br>
     <br>
     Anyway, I was wondering whether any of you may be experimenting on <br>
     college students...for all I know California may be teeming with <br>
     eidetic workshops but I can't find any in my phone book.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Anti Matter:<br>
     <br>
     I once heard some science show say that the energy yield from a <br>
     theoretical anti matter engine would get us to Pluto in nine <br>
     minutes...I more recently heard that a wee chunk of it has been <br>
     manufactured and am curious as to what's to be done with it. <br>
     <br>
     Anyone got any clues?<br>
     <br>
     <br>
