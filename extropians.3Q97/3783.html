Well, there's Dawkins' _River out of Eden_, Chapter 3... "Do Good By<br>
Stealth". <br>
<p>
But I'm not sure how much more compact it is than _Blind Watchmaker_.<br>
<p>
One of the points that some recent contact with Creationists has brought up<br>
is that any mutation is thought to automatically confer a crippling<br>
"unfitness"--e.g., a visual-purple pigment spot without supporting<br>
neurology and opaque pigment. This is regarded as more damning than "what<br>
good is one percent of an eye"; Anything you can do to scotch that, including<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;examples such as how the</i><br>
<i>&gt;theory explains maladjustments of structure -- insects that use wings to</i><br>
<i>&gt;swim, the webbed feet of upland geese and of frigate birds which do not use</i><br>
<i>&gt;them for paddling</i><br>
<p>
...is a good thing.<br>
<p>
BTW, I've been posting to extropians@extropy.org, but those emails have not<br>
been appearing to show up. Any suggestions?<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
<p>
Michael<br>
