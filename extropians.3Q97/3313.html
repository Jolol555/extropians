<i>  &gt;&gt;Rick Knight responds to EvMick:</i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;Is this an example of an unrestrained market or has an "excess"  </i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;been reached?</i><br>
<p>
<i> &gt;EvMick responds:</i><br>
<i> &gt;This has nothing to do with a Free Market.  The essence of Free Market</i><br>
<i> &gt;Economics is Freedom....(Duh...I wonner why they call it THAT?)...Individual</i><br>
<i> &gt;Freedom...to which Theft, Slavery, Torture and Murder are Anathema.</i><br>
<p>
Total freedom often means the law of the jungle, were murdering (or at<br>
least killing) competitors for recources is the smart thing to do.<br>
If I kill all competitors before a job-interview it would be murder. But if<br>
I allow somebody to starve to death that could have technically been saved<br>
with a minute financial offer from me, it's OK (especially is the person is<br>
living far away). From a Darwinian viewpoint ther's no difference between<br>
the two. Each of us draws a line: that is murder, this is exercising my<br>
right as a free person.<br>
Where the line is drawn depends (IMHO) mainly on your own economic position<br>
and of the standards upheld by the people around you (culture, how you were<br>
raised).<br>
What one person calls a free-market economy, others will call facism.<br>
What others person calls social-democracy, some will call communism.<br>
<p>
(Funny thing is that in practice facism and communism are not so much<br>
difference, from the perspective of the individual living in such a country<br>
- they both suck big-time. Just looking at works of 'art' created under<br>
Hitler and Stalin should give a clear hint.)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;You make good choices you might be another Bill Gates.</i><br>
<p>
Please don't, one Bill Gates is all that computer-users can handle.<br>
(sorry I just *had* to say this ;-)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;You make bad choices....you might die.</i><br>
<p>
Lot's of people die because of choices others make (drink &amp; drive) or just<br>
of 'bad luck'. Many life-influencing events are beyond the control of the<br>
individual (wars, diseases, market fluctuations and other 'acts of god')<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;Call it "Evolution in Action"</i><br>
<p>
Of course in a true 'Darwinian Economy' optimising use of resources would<br>
mean elimination all non-productive individuals (like ants). After that all<br>
individuals that aren't productive enough given their consumption of<br>
limited recources). So after we kill all physically- or metally chalanged,<br>
unemployed and elderly we give IQ-test to all 5-year olds, score below 110?<br>
Kill them to. Then up the minimum by .5 point per year. Combined with<br>
automation of simpler work we should see some dramatic increase in the<br>
standard of living of smart, hardworking people.<br>
Very optimal, very efficient.<br>
I'll pass...<br>
<p>
I'm not calling anybody a facist or labeling them with other -ism's, I just<br>
arguing that taking a single principle all the way can lead to horrible<br>
situations (No news, just something that needs to be said every now and then).<br>
