If you go to <br>

And search for "Diffie-Hellman" to find out about the Gnu<br>
Project's plan to develop an unencumbered equivalent of PGP<br>
using unpatented algorithms such as Diffie-Hellman (the patent<br>
of which recently expired), and triple-DES or Blowfish.<br>
<p>
RSA and IDEA, used by PGP, are both patented, and the corporations<br>
that manage the licensing of the patents are way more susceptible<br>
to legislative pressure than the free software community.  I have<br>
been thinking about starting work on the task above if no one else<br>
beats me to it (I have yet to contact FSF about it). In any case,<br>
sooner or later there should be at least one completely unencumbered<br>
secure cryptography package about as strong and easy to use as PGP.<br>
The governments of this planet will have a very difficult time<br>
containing something like that.<br>
