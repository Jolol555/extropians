Thanks to Lee Daniel Crocker for an inspiring discussion of some of<br>
the EXTRO-3 presentations re Future of the Body and Brain:<br>
<p>
&lt;. . . after we are all distributed intelligences in a large network,<br>
where are "we"? "We" are at the Instruction Pointer of our thread, of<br>
course, waiting for our timeslice to intend for one more cycle).&gt;<br>
<p>
This "Instruction Pointer of our thread" concept is fascinating.  I<br>
had recently read something about "essential indexicals" in AI (see<br>
second to last ref below) that sounded similar.  So, I did a search on<br>
this and got some interesting links which may be of interest to some. <br>
Most of them pointed to the work of John Perry (author of _The Problem<br>
of the Essential Indexical and Other Essays_, Oxford University Press,<br>
1993) and director of the Stanford University Center For the Study of<br>
Language and Information (CSLI).  CSLI faculty includes such AI elders<br>
as John McCarthy and Terry Winograd.<br>
<p>
Of particular interest was the "Rational Agency: Information and<br>
Action" project at CSLI (see<br>
<a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/csli/projects/cogsci9495-perry.html">http://www-csli.stanford.edu/csli/projects/cogsci9495-perry.html</a> )<br>
from which I quote:<br>
<p>
&lt; The aim of the Rational Agency project is to provide models and<br>
theories of situated, resource-bounded, intelligent action. The scope<br>
of the research covers rational activities of human beings, including<br>
the use of language, and also the activities of artificial agents with<br>
a variety of rational and deliberative abilities. . . . The conception<br>
of intelligent agents underlying this work is less idealized and more<br>
computationally motivated than the existing models available from<br>
philosophy, decision theory, and artificial intelligence (AI)---the<br>
main sources of our work. Much of this previous work has abstracted<br>
from the fact that agents are resource-bounded: they have a limited<br>
amount of time to determine what action to take, and they cannot do an<br>
arbitrarily large amount of work in that time. Moreover, the work in<br>
AI has, for the most part, considered only the simple case in which<br>
the agent's environment does not change as its plans are executed. In<br>
contrast, this project aims to model resource-bounded,<br>
information-sensitive agents acting in dynamic environments. A<br>
corollary goal of the work is the axiomatic characterization of the<br>
functional components of such agents and their modes of interaction.&gt;<br>
<p>
Some abstracts of various CSLI papers / lectures can be found in the<br>
CSLI calendars, for example at<br>
<a href="http://mambo.ucsc.edu/psl/cslisem/199505/19950524.html">http://mambo.ucsc.edu/psl/cslisem/199505/19950524.html</a> <br>
<p>
Mark Textor’s online paper, "Truth and Understanding Demonstratives"<br>
which has a chapter on "Indexicals and Indexical Meta-languages", at<br>
<a href="http://kanpai.stanford.edu/publications/understanding/understanding.html">http://kanpai.stanford.edu/publications/understanding/understanding.html</a><br>
also looks interesting.<br>
