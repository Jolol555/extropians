     Forrest Bishop cited CNN as reporting:<br>
     <br>
     Six countries currently execute children (people<br>
     under the age of 18):<br>
     <br>
     Iran<br>
     Iraq<br>
     Bangladesh<br>
     Pakistan<br>
     Nigeria (?)<br>
     USA<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     This actually brings up an interesting subject I've been meaning to <br>
     broach in this forum.  It ties in with the thread about age of <br>
     consent, the access to information for all ages, etc.. <br>
     <br>
     In this country, we're presently deciding capital punishment is okay.  <br>
     I have an interesting position on this.  Since I can honestly say that <br>
     I don't invest all but the most affrontive information about things <br>
     like<br>
     * starving or murdered people in the Third World<br>
     * jet crashes killing everyone<br>
     * or even when the Oklahoma City bombing killed those many people <br>
     (which should've tweaked me considerably since I had a front row seat <br>
     to the fatal result of a terrorist bombing in 85), <br>
     <br>
     I can also honestly say that whether a person convicted of a capital <br>
     crime will be systematically exterminated by the state doesn't really <br>
     move me one way or another.  Since I hold that consciousness has <br>
     metaphysical existence separate from physicality BUT I don't hold the <br>
     superstitious and disabling heaven/hell beliefs, it's almost like a <br>
     person is getting off the hook if you execute them.  YET, I think <br>
     prisons have become places of cruel and unusual punishment.<br>
     <br>
     Bottom line is how we're handling life-ending crimes in our culture.  <br>
     We incarcerate or incinerate (alliterative leeway taken here).  We <br>
     DON'T seem to rehabilitate except where it's the earnest desire of the <br>
     offending individual.<br>
     <br>
     Here's the Extropian part:<br>
     <br>
     With the advent of new technology (prior to the all-bets-are-off <br>
     Singularity thing okay?), is it more "appropriate" to:<br>
     <br>
     * pay for their wastoid incarceration (via tax dollars)<br>
     * pay for their somehow grossly expensive execution/appeal processes<br>
     * give them the option to biologically be reprogrammed as a civil <br>
     servant &lt;G&gt;<br>
     <br>
     Okay, a little joke, but biological reprogramming is the gist.  What <br>
     behooves a cooperative society most efficiently, particularly one <br>
     currently driven by our economic structure?<br>
     <br>
     And the last notion, executing children.  There have been some <br>
     abhorrent crimes committed by children of late.  I, for one, refuse to <br>
     justify their actions simply because they are young.  Western <br>
     children, perhaps even the least educated, are likely exposed to more <br>
     information by their prepubescent years than most Eastern Europeans <br>
     prior to WWII were in their entire lives.  But the question of <br>
     execution applies to the previous point I make in this post.<br>
     <br>
     As I mentioned, there are interesting tangents regarding sexual age of <br>
     consent.  In this information-rich age, when do we DECIDE that <br>
     children are accountable?  <br>
     <br>
     Does information bring about discernment and rationality?<br>
     <br>
