In a message dated 97-08-04 17:14:08 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; What puzzles me is how tool-use occurred throughout<br>
 humanity, but at some point stopped developing for some people, whilst<br>
 others continued to develop more and more advanced technology.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
In relation to this idea I might add that of a "water" culture or an<br>
Irrigation culture...in which the control of the water controls the culture.<br>
 Egypt was one such.  The ruling class gets entrenched.. (no! not conspiricy<br>
theory...) and maintains the status quo...forcefully.<br>
<p>
In Japan gunpowder was invented....then shelved....for the ruling class were<br>
swordsmen....and gunpowder would have upset the status quo.<br>
<p>
China had many, many potentially explosive inventions...(also gunpowder)..of<br>
which nothing was ever made...perhaps for the same reason.<br>
<p>
A n aside.<br>
<p>
Rome was destroyed by tax collectors....the barbarains just did the mopping<br>
up.<br>
Relegion was devoloped by the rulers to quell competetiion ....make the<br>
populace happy with their lot.<br>
<p>
Very Interesting..perhaps the answer would be found in a technological<br>
history of the world rather than the usual political rendition?<br>
