Lots of things reflect neutrons, the best is Beryllium because it has more <br>
atoms per volume than any other element, but Beryllium is very light and a <br>
good tamper needs to be heavy. Any heavy element, like lead, would fit the <br>
bill but for reasons I will explain later, in a modern H bomb U238 <br>
(the common isotope) is used. <br>
<p>
The chemical explosive used is HMX, also called OCTOGEN, it has a detonation <br>
velocity of 9100 meters per second verses 7000 for TNT. <br>

             <br>
The explosive does not push directly on the plutonium it pushed on the heavy <br>
neutron reflector around the inner sphere of U235 (the rare hard to get <br>
isotope) or Plutonium. This massive tamper has several jobs, it reflects <br>
neutrons, it helps to make the spherical shock wave more even, and when the <br>
plutonium or U235 starts to get hot its great mass slows the expansion and <br>
so gives the plutonium more time to complete its nuclear reactions.<br>
<p>
Water is in no way involved in the physics of a nuclear explosion but it is<br>
involved in the manufacture of nuclear bombs, more specifically plutonium,<br>
and plutonium works even better than U235 in a bomb. A neutron is more <br>
likely to react to common U238 if it's moving slowly, and water slows down<br>
neutrons. When a slow neutron hits U238 it does not undergo fission but it<br>
turns it into U239, this has a half life of 24 minutes and it decays into<br>
neptunium 239, this has a half life of 2.3 days and it decays into<br>
plutonium 239, and plutonium 239 has a half life of 14,000 years and works <br>
great in bombs.<br>
<p>
Make a bunch of uranium rods in which the U235 has been enriched from its<br>
natural .7% abundance to 2%, make sure there is water between the rods, <br>
without it the reaction will not go and if the water is not flowing the <br>
reactor will get very hot very fast and you're in trouble. Let the reactor <br>
operate for several weeks then stop it and take the rods out. The slow <br>
neutrons have turned much of the common U238 into exotic plutonium that can <br>
be separated from the uranium by simple chemical means.<br>
<p>
In a H bomb the fission trigger gets the deutroniun and tritium so hot they<br>
fuse, when they do it produces a helium 4 nucleus with 3.5 mev of energy,<br>
but more importantly a neutron with 17.6 mev of energy. When a neutron with <br>
this enormous speed hits U238 things are very different than when a slow <br>
neutron does in a reactor, the U238 fissions and releases a lot of energy in <br>
the process. In fact, in a garden variety H bomb 70% of the energy released <br>
comes from the fission of the heavy U238 tamper, although of course that <br>
wouldn't be possible without the super high speed neutron produced from the <br>
fusion reaction.<br>
                                        <br>

<i>        &gt;it could be that no amount of water decreases the size of a critical </i><br>
<i>        &gt;mass.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Anything outside of the sphere that reflects neutrons will reduce the critical <br>
mass, it also depends on purity, especially for uranium. For 100% U235 and <br>
assuming no neutron reflection you would need a 15 kilogram sphere to go <br>
critical, at 40% you would need 75. For plutonium at 100% just 4.4 kilograms <br>
would do and even at 25% purity a 20 kilogram sphere would go boom. These <br>
figures can be reduced with neutron reflection and if the chemical explosive <br>
compresses the fissionable metal to greater than normal density. If the <br>
tamper is massive it will slow the time it takes for the sphere to expand <br>
enough to stop the reaction, so you get a bigger more efficient explosion.<br>
