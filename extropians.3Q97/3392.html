finding a new paradigm that solves the problem, not ignores it. <br>
Sanctioning victim mentality is not going to solve a thing. It hasn't<br>
in the past and it isn't likely to in the future. &gt;<br>
<p>
"VICTIM MENTALITY" seems to be a dominant theme in today’s memetics. <br>
The following is from the Wednesday, September 10, Wall Street Journal<br>
editorial page in a commentary by Frank Furedi called "Princess Diana<br>
And the New Cult Of Victimhood" <br>
<p>
&lt; It all seems so terribly un-British. The British character was<br>
traditionally supposed to be about having a "stiff upper lip" and<br>
"remaining silent in the face of adversity." The unprecedented public<br>
display of grief after Princess Diana's death seemed to reveal a sea<br>
change in Britain's culture. What we witnessed last week was more than<br>
an outburst of public emotion. It is the emergence of a new secular<br>
religion, with a distinct set of values and attitudes. The new<br>
religion celebrates emotion, deplores reason and above all reveres the<br>
victim.<br>
<p>
As a self-styled victim, Diana is the perfect deity for the new<br>
religion. She was popular not just because she was beautiful and<br>
committed to good causes, but most of all because she suffered, and<br>
she did so publicly. [SNIP]<br>
<p>
In contemporary Britain as in the U.S., victimhood and suffering<br>
represent a claim to moral authority. Lost is an important<br>
distinction: While suffering can be character forming, it does not by<br>
itself endow an individual with any special knowledge or virtue.<br>
<p>
The British political community has adopted "unity through suffering"<br>
as one of its unspoken slogans. [Snip] At a time when collective<br>
reactions are rare, these expressions of solidarity are just about the<br>
only manifestations of national unity offered, and the politicians and<br>
media have milked them for all they are worth. [Snip]<br>
<p>
This culture of vulnerability has also become institutionalized.<br>
Public figures are expected to cry and acknowledge their weakness and<br>
frailty. Emotion, once foreign and unfitting in the public realm, has<br>
become commonplace in British political life over the past decade.<br>
Politicians hug, kiss and weep at the slightest opportunity; the art<br>
of displaying just how much you "feel" and "care" is more important<br>
than governing. Those who refuse to humble themselves in public are<br>
stigmatized as uncaring, inhuman and aloof.<br>
<p>
[SNIP]<br>
As Diana's funeral brought the country to a standstill, the message<br>
was clear: It has become sacrilegious to suggest that suffering has no<br>
intrinsic meaning, or to state that the experience of being a victim<br>
does not automatically confer on the individual any special qualities.<br>
An enlightened society would treat its victims with compassion and<br>
respect, but not with the kind of adulation that should be reserved<br>
for heroes. And that's just the point: Yesterday's public adored and<br>
revered heroes, today's celebrates frailty and weakness.<br>
<p>
Britain has not only lost Diana. If the experience of the past week is<br>
any indication, it may also have lost something more important: the<br>
belief that what matters is what you do, not how much you say you<br>
suffer. &gt;<br>
