Sorry. <br>
<p>
In the situation, the person would not be killed for that reason, as<br>
they have committed much more heinous reasons for which to be erased,<br>
but may be spared if they indicated that they had the capacity to be<br>
redeemed. It is to determine whether the material being judged is<br>
capable of being recycled or should be incinerated that such an<br>
evaluation is made... The criminal must demonstrate their capacity to be<br>
redeemed. If he doesn't, lets not waste further tax dollars on him, fry<br>
the mad dog.<br>
<p>
I value human life highly. So highly that I feel that people who do not<br>
value human life do not value their own life enough to go on living.<br>

<i>&gt; I refer to Morgan Freeman's character's parole hearing,</i><br>
<i>&gt; at which he said something like "You know and I know</i><br>
<i>&gt; that this is all baloney, so just stamp your little papers</i><br>
<i>&gt; and let me get back to my cell."</i><br>
<p>
And if you compare his performance before the board then to his prior<br>
ones in which he was denied parole, you can visibly see a difference in<br>
the earnestness of the character. Before when he is saying "I've learned<br>
my lesson, etc." you can tell he's bullshitting. When he finally says<br>
what you quote, you can see that he accepts the boards authority to do<br>
what they wish. He is essentially broken. They know then that he is of<br>
no further threat to society...<br>
