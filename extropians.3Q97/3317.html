Killers and defectors may cooperate with each other as well. One<br>
consequence of spontaneous order is the "syndicate." When one person<br>
realizes that it is more efficient to kill or steal for resources, you<br>
can be reasonably sure that others are of like mind. Order does not seem<br>
to have any moral connotations other than in relation to moral views<br>
concerning disorder. Spontaneous order may be for the community or<br>
against it.<br>
