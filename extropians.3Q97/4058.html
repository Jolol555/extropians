Geoff Smith:<br>
: &gt; Obviously, your definition of a person is not useful<br>
: &gt; for an outside observer.<br>
<p>
John Clark:<br>
: I disagree, if a chunk of matter acts in a John Clark-ish way<br>
: then it is John Clark.<br>
<p>
Can any definition be more useful for an outside observer?<br>
<p>
: &gt; With this philosophy, I assume you judge a person by a clean-slate<br>
: &gt; policy? Do you think people are not responsible for past actions<br>
: &gt; because it doesn't matter how they got to be the way they are, it's<br>
: &gt; just the way they are now?<br>
:<br>
: No, if I'm a serial killer then so is my copy.<br>
: I wish nothing had to suffer, ever, not even evil men, after all they<br>
: suffer just as intently as a good man. Unfortunately that's not possible<br>
: and evil men must be punished, but there are only 2 reason that I can find<br>
: to justify that, to keep the person from committing more evil acts and as<br>
: a deterrent for others. That is justice, more than that is vengeance.<br>
<p>
You've given me an idea for a story.  A multiple murderer, before being<br>
caught, gets himself cured of whatever drove him to kill.  But he owes<br>
a fortune in wergild, far more than the present value of his expected<br>
lifetime earnings.  Failure to pay will make him an outlaw.  So he<br>
has himself copied, and the debt is distributed among the copies.<br>
Plot complications ensue.<br>
<p>
I wish Vinge had raised the question of assigning liability<br>
for a Tines pack's debts and torts when the pack is split up.<br>
