In a message dated 97-08-30 20:46:02 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Danny, several of the guys who initiated the crop circle hoax have<br>
 come forward. They've explained their methods. There are no instances<br>
 of crop circles that cannot be generated by these methods.<br>
 <br>
 Now, lets apply Occam's razor: Which is more likely, that all<br>
 crop circles are hoaxes, or that most are, but a few are generated<br>
 by aliens, and the aliens started after the first hoax?<br>
 <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Actually about 30% are man made.  Theres a big difference between the two,<br>
the alien ones have bent stalks, which are impossible to duplicate(the<br>
chromosones are changed), and the man made ones are broken.  Also the real<br>
ones are much more precise and sometimes the wheat is found braided.  Those<br>
guys were paid to do that.<br>
