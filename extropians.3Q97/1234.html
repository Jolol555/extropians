<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, but I wouldn't trivialize it with the label "semantic" because</i><br>
<i>&gt; that's exactly what Science is all about, showing how 2 apparently</i><br>
<i>&gt; different things are really related on a deeper level.  Electric and</i><br>
<i>&gt; magnetic fields seemed to have very different properties, then in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the greatest discovery of 19'th century Physics, Faraday and Maxwell</i><br>
<i>&gt; proved that there was a profound relationship between the two and</i><br>
<i>&gt; both were instances of the set Y, set Y being Electromagnetism.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree in the strongest possible terms with your characterization<br>
here.<br>
<p>
In the 19th Century, we were learning new facts about Electricity and<br>
Magnetism -- and Maxwell's equations constituted new information about<br>
the topic -- most importantly, they had the interesting property of<br>
predicting new facts like electromagnetic waves (thus forming the<br>
cornerstone of all scientific thought, the falsifiable hypothesis.)<br>
<p>
In the question of "is the Mandelbrot set 'real'", we have a very<br>
different debate. All facts about the Mandelbrot set relevant to the<br>
area are well known. The debate is entirely over how one defines<br>
"reality". No information will come out of the discussion other than<br>
perhaps "which definitions of 'reality' would apply to the Mandelbrot<br>
set and which ones will not?" No falsifiable hypotheses result. No new<br>
insights arise.<br>
<p>
The person posing the question implicitly has already answered it if<br>
he has properly stated the question. This means that the answer yields<br>
all the thrill that you get in putting a number on a sheet of paper,<br>
placing the paper into an envelope, and then attempting to guess the<br>
number that you yourself wrote down.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Almost all such arguments boil down to questions of definitionalism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;"Is the Mandelbrot set 'real'", for instance, hinges entirely</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;on the question of how one defines 'real'. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Except that nobody has a definition of reality that's worth a damn,</i><br>
<p>
On the contrary. There are many reasonable definitions. Some of them<br>
are even rigorous. None of them have the property of being what I<br>
would call "interesting", however -- and none ever can.<br>
<p>
There are whole rafts of such utterly meaningless "to be"<br>
definitionalism questions that philosophers have tortured themselves<br>
with over the centuries. "What is the meaning of life" is my favorite,<br>
though "is X real" has been high up on the list ever since Plato came<br>
up with the Metaphor of the Cave in "The Republic"...<br>
