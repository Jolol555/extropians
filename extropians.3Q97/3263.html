<i> &gt;Simplistically (remember this word) it seems that you suspect a causal link</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; from  spirituality to creativity. </i><br>
<p>
It is not simplistic at all, merely eloquent. Thanks.<br>
It was not a causal link I was suggesting. And you have a *very* good point.<br>
If one agrees there is a link of any sort, it is not a causal factor:  it is<br>
a tool at best - and a very primitive one! <br>
Obviously, it is not *necessary* that one have spirituality to have<br>
creativity ( if so I should have a barren studio) I still note that in those<br>
who practice, there is a "brain set" which so -called spirituality and<br>
pseudo-science (by demanding that one actually believe a lot of make-believe,<br>
and then even go so far as to _act_on it) encourages. It makes one more<br>
gullible, naive, as well as  more likely to indulge in fantasy. It encourages<br>
flights of fancy. It "sets the stage" for a wider range of topics and<br>
scenarios on which to build imagined scenes...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;My suspicion is that creativity without criticism leads to spirituality, and</i><br>
what we can try to inspire critical thinking without depressing creativity at<br>
the same time.<br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
However, it is not  the tool "criticism" that is lacking,  more the DESIRE<br>
for utilizing it. <br>
As I asserted, if one tool works people will not readily give it up unless we<br>
show them how to use the new one to achieve their aim.<br>
Critical thought is not an appropriate response to make- believe. If we KNOW<br>
it's make believe, that is. What Sagan talks about in Demon Haunted World<br>
when he asks: "Mommy, how do I know the difference between what I imagine in<br>
my head and what is real?"<br>
<p>
I think you are correct: Pseudo science is a substitute for real, solid<br>
science, and works for people because it is "creativity" without any "facts".<br>
But it is interesting, catches the imagination.<br>
<p>
There is also a huge tradition in storytelling to make things *more<br>
interesting* by elaborating the truth. <br>
