The August 7, 1997 Wall Street Journal "Bookshelf" column features Jim<br>
Holt’s review of two new books on parallel world theories: David<br>
Deutsch’s _The Fabric of Reality_ and Roger Penrose’s _The Large, the<br>
Small, and the Human Mind_:<br>
<p>
"'Ask a famous physicist what science reveals about reality and<br>
there's no telling what sort of answer you'll get.' Stephen Hawking<br>
will inform you that physics merely predicts observations and that it<br>
is meaningless to talk about how it might 'correspond' to reality.<br>
He's what's known as a positivist.<br>
<p>
"Roger Penrose, an equally great physicist, will give you a radically<br>
different answer. What we learn from physics, he'll say, is that the<br>
material universe depends for its existence on a perfect world of<br>
abstract mathematical ideas that some of us consciously commune with.<br>
Mr. Penrose, in other words, is a Platonist.<br>
<p>
"Then there's David Deutsch, who has unblushingly titled his<br>
interesting new book _The Fabric of Reality_. A researcher at Oxford<br>
and ‘an acclaimed quantum physicist’ . . . he is not in the least shy<br>
about dismissing Hawking-style positivism as self-refuting, or<br>
Penrose-style Platonism as a ‘a rickety fantasy.’ For his part, he is<br>
quite sure that physics ‘tells us something new and bizarre about the<br>
nature of reality’: namely, that we live in a ‘multiverse’ where<br>
everything that can happen does happen.<br>
<p>
"What makes the divergence of viewpoints . . . so wonderful is that,<br>
far from being New Age kooks, they are three rational, hard-headed<br>
guys who use exactly the same equations in their everyday scientific<br>
work. The problem is that 20th-century quantum physics has an<br>
unsettling weirdness about it. . . . This has led scientists who<br>
insist on making sense of the world to some pretty extravagant<br>
hypotheses. Some have lobbied for a new ‘quantum logic’ that permits<br>
contradictions. Others have argued that reality is created by<br>
measuring devices or by consciousness. Still others have posited a<br>
ghostly web that allows all the particles in the universe to<br>
communicate with one another instantaneously.<br>
<p>
"The hypothesis that Mr. Deutsch fiercely defends - and makes the<br>
basis of his world view - is the most extravagant of all. Dubbed the<br>
‘many universes’ interpretation . . . According to the ‘many<br>
universes’ view, all the quantum possibilities that determine the<br>
outcome of subatomic events are actualities in some parallel universe.<br>
. . . But because of the intricacies of ‘quantum interference’ (which<br>
Mr. Deutsch does a superb job of explaining), these parallel universes<br>
affect one another only at the tiniest level. . . .<br>
<p>
"Does all this leave you feeling skeptical? Then, says Mr. Deutsch,<br>
consider the quantum computer. This device - envisaged by Richard<br>
Feynman in 1982 and largely theoretical so far, though a simple<br>
prototype was built by IBM in 1989 - harnesses quantum phenomena to<br>
achieve unheard of computational feats. Using something called ‘Shor's<br>
algorithm,’ a quantum computer can factor giant numbers and thereby<br>
break secret codes that no conventional computer could touch. The only<br>
way it could do this, Mr. Deutsch argues, is by distributing its<br>
operations over many parallel universes. "To those who still cling to<br>
a single-universe world-view," he writes with evident asperity, ‘I<br>
issue the challenge: explain how Shor's algorithm works.’<br>
<p>
"Combining the many-universes notion with quantum computability, and<br>
adding elements of Darwinism and Karl Popper's theory of knowledge,<br>
Mr. Deutsch aspires to nothing less than a complete understanding of<br>
‘the fabric of reality.’ Arrogant in tone and marred by leaps of<br>
logic, his book nonetheless bristles with subversive insights about<br>
virtual reality, time travel, mathematical certainty and free will.<br>
Intellectually speaking, Mr. Deutsch is mad, bad and dangerous to know.<br>
<p>
"So, for that matter, is Roger Penrose. In "The Large, the Small, and<br>
the Human Mind", the English physicist tries once again to make us<br>
share his conviction that the answer to the puzzle of human<br>
consciousness lies in physics. . . . Even if Mr. Penrose turns out to<br>
be wrong, he is always worth reading. In this volume - daunting as<br>
usual, but blessedly slim - Mr. Penrose's arguments are followed by<br>
critiques from Stephen Hawking and from philosophers of science Nancy<br>
Cartwright and Abner Shimony . . . Mr. Hawking marvels at how Mr.<br>
Penrose, his former collaborator on the theory of black holes, has<br>
come to hold such different views from his on mind and reality. These<br>
days, it seems, there's no telling a fellow's metaphysics from his<br>
physics."<br>
