     Guru George stated:<br>
     <br>
     Basically, there seems to be pretty good evidence for a fairly uniform<br>
     and sophisticated pre Indo-European culture across the whole <br>
     Mediterranean and Balkan region from about 7000 BC to about 3500 BC, <br>
     which seems tohave been gradually destroyed by successive waves of  <br>
     invasions by bastards with bronze swords, who subsequently got to <br>
     build all the monuments.  Kind of depressing really.<br>
     <br>

     Thus the first clamor towards owning beach front property was born.  <br>
     Seriously though, as things turned out, it seems like more barbaric <br>
     tribes of humans short-circuited what may have been a much <br>
     sooner-to-arrive age of prosperity for those emerging cultures.  Don't <br>
     know enough about the history other than to skim the surface but I <br>
     find it fascinating how history seems to be defined by its wars.  <br>
     Maybe this is where it all started.  When things are going smoothly, <br>
     not much to write home about.<br>
