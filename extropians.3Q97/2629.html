        I have a succinct feeling Everett Mick might like this one...<br>
<p>
<p>
Uncle Sam<br>
<p>
<p>
Someone is dying right now.<br>
His hands are clenched and clammy,<br>
His mind is swimming in a limitless sea<br>
Of democracy.<br>
They told him that he could speak<br>
(The government is the “they”),<br>
But when he tried to speak his mind,<br>
They took that “privilege” away;<br>
So, now that he has no language,<br>
Now that he has no real power,<br>
He is dying in the arms of Liberty<br>
(Herself, dying by the hour).<br>
Since he tried to follow the charter<br>
And have power by the people,<br>
He is now perishing in order--<br>
Told to obey tradition<br>
And use cognition.<br>
Democracy’s hypocrisy has quelled his free will,<br>
And a death of sorts has brought him some disease;<br>
He knows the rules of life are all too clear:<br>
Never question traditions or challenge authorities.<br>
