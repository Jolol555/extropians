<i>&gt; Dear fellow Extropians,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The was a news item on the web several days ago that indicated that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; German company (I believe it was Mercedes, but don't honestly recall.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; announced that they had developed a prototype fuel cell for automobiles.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They further stated that they believed that it would replace the internal</i><br>
<i>&gt; combustion engine within the next decade. They claim that the fuel cell</i><br>
<i>&gt; uses hydrogen as is source of energy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously, this is outside my area of expertise. I suspect, however, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; there are those among you with substantially more technological knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; than I have who might understand the broad implications of this particular</i><br>
<i>&gt; development.</i><br>
<i>&gt; My concern is with its impact on social, economic and international</i><br>
<i>&gt; relations initiatives.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Your thoughtful responses would be appreciated.</i><br>

The Hydrogen must itself be generated, generally from a more<br>
traditional energy source. Since you can use electricity to<br>
generate the hydrogen, you can make fairly efficient and clean<br>
use of just about anything, notably including nuclear power.<br>
However, the result still depends on large centralized<br>
power generation. You can convert the electricity to hydrogen<br>
locally or even within the fuel cell itself, in which case the<br>
fuel cell is essentially acting as a battery. Or, you can<br>
try to convert to a "hydrogen economy", with distribution<br>
of hydrogen via pipelines. This is a non-trivial excersize,<br>
since hydrogen/air mixtures are explosive in any ratio<br>
from 90%/10% to 10%/90%, and hydrogen molecules are very<br>
tiny, requireing specialized pipes and joints.<br>
<p>
If you use coal or nukes, world energy potitics may change<br>
dramatically. If you use oil-fired plants to generate<br>
electricity, there's no big change at this level.<br>
