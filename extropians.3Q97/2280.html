The reason I said that "in the long-term" we will have<br>
sensory-rich/physically safe environments is because I've seen examples of<br>
them, understand the current trends and have a good idea of what technology<br>
will allow us to do.  I guess I should have said, "It may be possible to<br>
create"?  Criticism noted.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure how saying 'some sort of parenting will always be necessary' is<br>
any more scientific than saying it won't be.  Especially on the grounds that<br>
'nothing's perfect'.  A need for parenting or no need for parenting can both<br>
be considered as 'utopian illusions' depending on your own brand of utopia.<br>
<p>
Such environments could be considered as artificial meta-parents, couldn't<br>
they? <br>
