<i>&gt; Why don't people kill each others? Because there is a law against it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; make murder legal and you will see people killing each others.</i><br>
<p>
What a hideous, depressing view of humanity.  I can't speak for you<br>
personally, but /I/ don't murder because /I/ personally find the act<br>
morally repugnant.  I think most ordinary people are the same.  There<br>
is always the occasional psychopath, but it is clear from history<br>
that the all the truly large-scale brutal mass murders are perpetrated<br>
by armies, under the auspices of a government, not by individuals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The rules and regulations prevent the market from employing people? </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't believe that.</i><br>
<p>
Your assignment: spend a hour with someone--anyone--who has tried<br>
to start a business in the U.S.  It will take em that long just to<br>
list all the regulations that get in his way.  And then ask him<br>
whether he'd rather spend all that time and money on taxes and<br>
regulation, or whether he'd rather hire more productive people.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [More economic nonsense snipped]</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'll be honest, I don't know what negative feedback is and I know</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing of basic economics but I always knew that "united we stand,</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; I read books, I find it, however, much less boring and time consuming to</i><br>
<i>&gt; ask other persons. Or do you read a book every time you have a doubt or</i><br>
<i>&gt; a question?</i><br>
<p>
Your next assignment: read David Friedman's web pages at<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.best.com/%7Eddfr/">http://www.best.com/%7Eddfr/</a>&gt;.  If you won't even take the first<br>
steps toward understanding something you admit ignorance of, why<br>
she we allow you to steal our valuable time responding to points<br>
that have been well covered by others?  Demonstrate that you have<br>
some initial commitment to learning, and we'd be more inclined to<br>
clarify any remaining questions you might have.<br>
