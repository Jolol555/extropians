Have you read the latest reports on the success rate of laser-guided bombs<br>
in the Gulf? Doesn't make good reading. Wish I hadn't mislaid the<br>
newspaper article I cut out or I'd give you figures. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As I recall, lookdown shootdown radar was not developed till the 80's,</i><br>

<p>
Maybe the soviets didn't, but Lockheed demonstrated it with the YF12 in<br>
the sixties. They could cruise along at Mach 3 at 70,000 feet and kill<br>
target drones flying at ninety feet. That the Air Force chose not to<br>
continue developing the technology probably has more to do with politics<br>
than engineering (i.e. they're not going to develop technology which<br>
makes the F111 obsolete). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, outside of losses in Vietnam, F-111's lost less than 10% attrition</i><br>
<i>&gt; over 20 years. WHile I was stationed in NM, we lost one plane (out of</i><br>

<i>&gt; has a failsafe where it puts the plane into a steep climb out if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; malfunctions.</i><br>
<p>
Didn't work very well in England. Presumably it wasn't well tested for<br>
European terrain (from what I remember of my one brief visit New Mexico<br>
was mostly flat with the odd mountain) ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That happens to consistently win awards at Red Flag bombing exercises.</i><br>
<p>
Doesn't matter if it can be shot down before it gets there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; proportionately, that there is a high wing loading, and the swing wings,</i><br>

<i>&gt; level, its adversary can automatically see which planes are in weak</i><br>
<i>&gt; positions at which points in a dogfight by the position of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; swingwing. </i><br>
<p>
Interesting, I hadn't thought of that. I wonder if it works in Strike<br>
Commander... could do with some help against those damn Tornados. <br>
