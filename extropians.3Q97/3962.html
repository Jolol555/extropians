This week's Business Week (Sept 22) has an excellent summary of current<br>
high-tech approaches to beating heart disease. Several very promising<br>
approaches appear to be coming onto the market very soon, perhaps to<br>
drastically reduce deaths due to the biggest source of mortality.<br>
<p>
The article covers advanced surgical procedures that use robots and tiny<br>
incisions (instead of cutting through the breast bone), and laser drills to<br>
improve blood flow, gene therapy (the Apo-1 Milano gene produces protective<br>
proteins similar to HDLs), drugs, genetically engineered animal heart<br>
transplants, and so on.<br>
<p>
The most fascinating device I found was an assist pump "called the<br>
Streamliner under development by Bartley Griffith, a cardiologist at the<br>
University of Pittsburgh. The Streamliner, about the size of a D-cell<br>
battery, whirls like a tiny turbine, pumping blood not in heartbeats but in<br>
a continuous flow: patients who get it will have no pulse."<br>
<p>
Walking around with no pulse! Now that's extropian chic!<br>
