<i>&gt; We assume that the (simulated) neural activity is what gives rise to</i><br>

<i>&gt; activity could give rise to a consciousness which does not match the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "true" consciousness being determined by the simulation.  This false</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness would have no way of interacting with the outside world, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; of revealing its existence through any overt behavior.  The person being</i><br>
<i>&gt; simulated would steadfastly deny that he had any unusual perceptions</i><br>
<i>&gt; or sensations due to the time warp simulation (because all the false</i><br>
<i>&gt; ones would get rolled back and erased).  Yet we have reason to think</i><br>
<i>&gt; that he is wrong, by the principle which identifies mental states with</i><br>
<i>&gt; (simulated) brain states.</i><br>

Wow! Sounds lot like the trickery done in Permutation City to<br>
confirm the "dust hypothesis". Of course, in that universe the<br>
backtracking would cause a branching all the time of slightly different<br>
individuals in parallel worlds.<br>
<p>
It is not unreasonable to think that similar unrolling happens in<br>
our minds. We already know that consciousness seems to be backdating<br>
itself (the experiments of Libet et al), and I assume Dennets<br>
draft model of consciousness also might include this. We might contain<br>
lots of "attempted persons", and only one becomes actual. <br>
