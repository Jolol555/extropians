<i>&gt; &gt;Second, a stock split lowers price per share allowing more investors to</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you think that this does not bring about an increase in liquidity?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Let me ask.  How easy is it to buy and sell a few shares of Berkshire</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hathaway?  Given that the share price is in the tens of thousands of</i><br>
<i>&gt; dollars, I'd say that it's not so easy to find buyers or sellers.  Just</i><br>
<i>&gt; as having your money in real estate makes it less liquid (less easy to</i><br>
<i>&gt; convert to cash), so does having it in higher-priced stock.</i><br>
<p>
Is it that high these days? It's always been up there, but that's damn<br>
high.<br>
<p>
I must have been misusing the term liquidity. If liquidity is a measure<br>
of the ease with which non-cash assets may be converted to cash, then I<br>
agree with you. I think I was defining it in a non-standard way, that is<br>
liquidity is a measure of cash assets. <br>
  <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I admit that there are two coupled forces at work here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. a lower price allows "the little guy" to get into the stock, directly</i><br>
<i>&gt;    driving up the price, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2. a lower price makes it easier to trade the stock.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I also agree that stock splits tend to be a sign that the company is</i><br>
<i>&gt; worth investing in, but I don't thing that this has much to do with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; increase in price after a split.  I say this for two reasons:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. If the company is worth buying right after the split, it was worth</i><br>
<i>&gt;    buying right before, and</i><br>
<p>
But that may not have been apparent to the investor until after the<br>
split. So he or she buys the stock only afterwards. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2. In my experience, the price of a split stock rises more *after* the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    split, not between the announcement of the impending split and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    split date.  If the reason for the run-up was that the split itself</i><br>
<i>&gt;    brought attention to the worth of the company, I contend that one</i><br>
<i>&gt;    would see more of a run-up after the announcement and before the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    actual split.</i><br>
<p>
This may be true. However one must look to the time-lag involved. Some<br>
of my mother's stocks have split without her ever knowing it would<br>
happen. If this is a function of her imperfect information, then I must<br>
also ask how many investors as reasonably well-informed as my mother had<br>
no idea the stock would split? This may or may not have an effect on<br>
price increase before the split. <br>
<p>
Furthermore, an announcement of an impending stock split is, as we seem<br>
to agree, akin to an announcement of a projected good fiscal year.<br>
Companies make positive projections all the time. However, they are only<br>
required by law to be honest in their propectus. I don't necessarily<br>
believe an announcement until I do some homework. That takes some time<br>
(unless a broker feels like giving me some free info). A stock split is<br>
evidence that the company is clearly confident about its future<br>
earnings. I would choose to wait and see if it splits at all, and then<br>
buy or hold (or even sell) as necessary. The risk to a company involved<br>
in splitting without confidence seems in most cases too great to warrant<br>
what would be an artificial jump in price after the split.     <br>
But I'm no expert on this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Finally, investors are more likely to buy shares at a low or mid-range</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;price than a very high price. To keep the share price going up steadily,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the board should split when it can.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, indeed.  Shares trade more readily when they are cheaper.  When</i><br>
<i>&gt; things trade more readily, they are relatively more liquid, yes?</i><br>
<p>
Again, I think you're right given my confusion concerning the definition<br>
of liquidity.<br>
<p>
Interesting discussion,<br>
<p>
