     Suddenly, Jeff is involved in an instantaneous, life taking,<br>
     but not brain destroying accident.  In other words, without expecting<br>
     to die he doesn't get the chance to, with his final breaths, say: "I<br>
     don't (or do) want to be cryonically preserved."  Let's say there just<br>
     happens to be a cryonic team there, ready to preserve him, and that<br>
     funds for the procedure and long term preservation are absolutely no<br>
     problem.  <br>

     Rick Knight asks:<br>
     <br>
     The last statement somewhat adds to my ongoing skepticism.  How <br>
     *available*, *reliable* and *knowledgeable* are emergency medical <br>
     personnel?  Does a person intending to be cryonically preserved wear a <br>
     special identification indicating alternative action?  Considering the <br>
     pervasive attitude of the acceptance of physical death, do healthy <br>
     extropians involved in fatal accidents have any assurance their bodies <br>
     will be expediently managed to the right fridge (cryonics crypt and <br>
     not the morgue)?<br>
