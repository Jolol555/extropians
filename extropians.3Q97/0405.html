No.  A conscious machine does not need to communicate in such a way, would<br>
you say that someone who cannot speak and hear is not conscious?  Surely<br>
seeing and feeling are enough to know you exist.  Even if I never tell anyone<br>
i'm conscious I an still conscious.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   The second condition is the tough one, of course. Let me propose a</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Turing style test by saying that a human using a teletype could not</i><br>
<i>&gt;   distinguish between a human (or other system presumed to be known as</i><br>
<i>&gt;   conscious) and the system under test, with the discussion limited to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;   topics we usually consider to be "about consciousness". If that is too</i><br>
<i>&gt;   general, how about "experience of existence".</i><br>
<p>
The last thing the world need is more 'Turing style' tests.  Do you really<br>
think the Turing test is a good way to detect machine intelligence?  Any<br>
discussions we have with something so different what not be anything like<br>
talking to a human.  In the same way, many different forms of consciousness<br>
exist and they are all so different that such a test would not prove<br>
consciousness, it would only prove similar lines of thought sorrounding<br>
consciousness.<br>
<p>
I agree that we need a definition of consciousness, but this is far from it.<br>
<p>
I think there are two things we are talking about in these posts.<br>
<p>
*Being aware - the very idea that I am conscious and I am looking out at the<br>
universe.<br>
<p>
*How I relate the physical to the abstract (that which exists in my mind) -<br>
How I see blue.. how you see blue, and how we relate seeing that colour to<br>
emotion.<br>
