&gt; E-Prime is English without the verb "to be" (is, are, was); more
&gt; specifically, without the "is of identity" ("John is a liar; Linda is a
&gt; lawyer; Edgar is stupid.").
&gt; 
&gt; E-Prime emerges from the tradition of General Semantics. The reason for
&gt; E-Prime is that the "is of identity" connotes an eternal Platonic
&gt; essence possessed by the thing that is said to "be" something. The "is
&gt; of identity" tends to blind both the speaker and the audience to many
&gt; important characteristics about the relationship between the person
&gt; being described and the quality or category being assigned to them. "Joe
&gt; is a racist": "Racism" is not a measurable quantity of an object like
&gt; mass or momentum; there is no "racism meter" we can point to a person
&gt; that will detect whether Joe has the "essence" of a "racist" in him.
&gt; "Racist" is a _name_ we give to an object based on our observations of
&gt; emergent phenomena like behavior; but the assignment of the label is in
&gt; our heads, not in physical reality. E-Prime, by restricting the use of
&gt; the "is of identity," makes explicit the fact that these are statements
&gt; about the state of our nervous system, not about the outside world.
&gt; E-Prime confines itself to observations and operational statements like
&gt; "Joe frequently makes statements that sound racist to me" or even "I
&gt; heard Joe say Angelo is a dirty wop."
&gt; 
&gt; Examples of English
&gt; sentences translated into E-Prime: ENGLISH: Marty is an asshole.
&gt; E-PRIME: Marty frequently says things that make me
&gt; angry. ENGLISH: Religious fanatics like David Koresh are dangerous.
&gt; (Makes the implicit assignment "David Koresh was a
&gt; religious fanatic.") E-PRIME: The government considered David Koresh,
&gt; whose followers believed he was God, a danger to
&gt; their authority. (Talks about who holds what beliefs.) ENGLISH: Natalie
&gt; Merchant's voice is the most beautiful in the world.
&gt; E-PRIME: I like Natalie Merchant's voice better than anyone else's.
&gt; ENGLISH: Natalie Merchant is a Commie dupe.
&gt; E-PRIME: Natalie Merchant has said she thinks private property is bad.
&gt; (An operational statement of an observable fact
&gt; regarding something somebody has said.) [dV/dt] #

Sorry, I forgot to tell you where I got this little explaination.

I don't know if this is an official FAQ, but I definitely found it
useful.
