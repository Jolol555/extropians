Hmmm. Interesting. Why could not God have spent 6 billion years creating<br>
the universe? A day is day is a day right? But a day can indeed be<br>
metaphorical -- worth a billion years even. But, in the end, IMHO, to<br>
believe Darwin takes faith, just not as much as the faith it takes to<br>
believe the Bible. Who's right? Well, given faith, the one with the<br>
right answer is the one that has more evidence ro make the argument.<br>
That's Darwin, you think? Why is God not on this list?<br>
