<i> &gt; Maybe it's indirect - xenophobes to fiction to popular "Borg" image</i><br>
<i> &gt; to fear - but the root still lies in xenophobia.</i><br>
<p>
There are many other possible reasons than generalized xenophobia.<br>
For instance, I've been busted and treated roughly by cops for<br>
things that I don't consider criminal, and I've been robbed at<br>
knifepoint, and have had a gun held to my head in an attempted<br>
robbery.  These experiences can instill an awareness of the<br>
possibility that there are some elements of my cosmos that are out<br>
to get me, and that awareness really doesn't have its "root" in<br>
generic xenophobia.  It has its root in concrete experiences.<br>
<p>
I'm not afraid of the Singularity; I just think it's a concept that<br>
is too general, too diffuse, and admits of vastly too many different<br>
reasonable interpretations to be very useful as a communications<br>
tool.  I'm not sure what conversations about the Singularity are<br>
accomplishing.  My whole attitude toward the Singularity is that<br>
things are going to get weirder than I can possibly imagine right<br>
now, in my lifetime.  On the one hand, that's not something that<br>
people have had to deal with before.  On the other hand, lots of<br>
religions have insisted on something like this, and people have<br>
been practicing and developing these religions for a couple of<br>
millennia, so maybe it is something that people in general are<br>
prepared for.  That's about all I think there is to be said on the<br>
matter in general, and on this list I enjoy discussions of the<br>
specifics.<br>
<p>
It *is* useful to use notions of the Singularity as Vinge did and<br>
the Spike as Broderick did, when addressing a wider audience, the<br>
sort of people who try our patience at times.  But these notions<br>
are not so useful on a list like this one. Most people here already<br>
know that things are getting weirder (and mostly better) and will<br>
continue to do so at an accelerating rate at least until the<br>
world has been changed beyond recognition.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; don't expect to be in charge, and it looks to me like the logic of</i><br>
<i> &gt; Libertarianism breaks down if you're omniscient For All Practical</i><br>
<i> &gt; Purposes.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, I'm calling you on this one.  "omniscient For All Practical<br>
Purposes" looks like a phrase with null semantic content to me.<br>
Could you please try rephrasing whatever it was you intended to<br>
say?<br>
