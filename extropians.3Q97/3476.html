     As Diana's funeral brought the country to a standstill, the message<br>
     was clear: It has become sacrilegious to suggest that suffering has no<br>
     intrinsic meaning, or to state that the experience of being a victim<br>
     does not automatically confer on the individual any special qualities.<br>
     An enlightened society would treat its victims with compassion and<br>
     respect, but not with the kind of adulation that should be reserved<br>
     for heroes. And that's just the point: Yesterday's public adored and<br>
     revered heroes, today's celebrates frailty and weakness.<br>
     <br>
     Britain has not only lost Diana. If the experience of the past week is<br>
     any indication, it may also have lost something more important: the<br>
     belief that what matters is what you do, not how much you say you<br>
     suffer. <br>

     Another spin: the royal family (Windsors) are an antiquated notion, <br>
     Britain's rich and famous icons (like our Hollywood icons).  The <br>
     citizenry (to whom that means anything) look to these people for <br>
     connection, to admire them and to whom their heritage as a <br>
     centuries-old monarchy is tied.  The Windsors behaved they way they <br>
     do, with reservation and disconnection.  This time, that wasn't <br>
     suitable for the British public.  Grief often brings out the pettiest <br>
     of qualities in people so they spent the week after Diana's death <br>
     resorting to quips about who was being authentic in their grief (if <br>
     they weren't busy assigning blame...the photogs, the drunk driver, the <br>
     antiquated construction of the tunnel).<br>
     <br>
     Diana may have been a victim but she was also a hero in the eyes of <br>
     her countrymen and apparently much of the world.  To try to classify <br>
     her as one thing or the other is rather moot in my book, save perhaps <br>
     for the exercise of classifying the British populace in a broad sweep <br>
     which also seems rather trite.<br>
     <br>
     Now, Mother Teresa, there's a victim for you!  Poor woman died of old <br>
     age and didn't sign up for cryonic preservation, a victim of her <br>
     antiquated belief system! ;-&gt;<br>
