A very good point. I don't think anybody has assumed that one can<br>
become human by reading books in this thread, it is mainly about what<br>
books should be considered "required reading" or at least good<br>
introductory reading to keep up with this list. <br>
<p>
It would be interesting to see if the process of becoming oneself<br>
could be aided by artificial means; so far it has been largely a<br>
random accumulation of experience and a gradual abstraction from<br>
them. Schooling is one method intended to make this process a bit<br>
more efficient, maybe some initiation rites could be considered<br>
growth tools too. Are there others reliable methods?<br>
