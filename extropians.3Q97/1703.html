     Mark Crosby conveyed a quote in regards to physicist Roger Penrose:<br>
     <br>
     "These days, it seems, there's no telling a fellow's metaphysics from <br>
     his physics."<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight:<br>
     <br>
     I prefer the blur personally between physics and metaphysics.  It <br>
     Keeps things interesting.  Much of the multi-verse theory seems to tie <br>
     in with a book I read many years ago that started me on the <br>
     metaphysical/transpersonal spin I'm still in.  Michael Talbot's "The <br>
     Holographic Universe".  Using the hologram as a model, Talbot, citing <br>
     Bohm, Sheldrake, and I believe Feynman tied in most supernatural <br>
     phenomenon with the notion that all events in time space are happening <br>
     all at once, the macrocosm is in the microcosm and that linear time <br>
     is/could be a perceptual issue.<br>
     <br>
