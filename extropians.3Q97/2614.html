I thought this might interest those of you who are the investigators,<br>
microbiologists and epidemiologists. <br>
_____________________________ <br>
Intentional microbiological food contamination is extremely rare, but it does<br>
occur.  <br>
In 1984, at "The Dalles," Oregon, 751 people who ate in ten restaurants<br>
became ill with _Salmonella_ food poisoning.    <br>
  <br>
After local health department epidemiologists began receiving an inordinate<br>
amount of complaints of food poisoning, an investigation was launched.  See:<br>
_A Large Community Outbreak of Salmonellosis Caused by Intentional<br>
Contamination of Restaurant Salad Bars_, Torok TJ, et al.  The investigators<br>
looked into the health of restaurant employees, the town water supply, and<br>
the food suppliers the restaurants used, yet no common factor could be found.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
A year later, the investigators had enough information to link a religious<br>
commune to the outbreak. The group had contaminated salad bar fixings and<br>
coffee creamers at the restaurants with a strain of _Salmonella_ bacteria in<br>
the hope of keeping voters away from polling booths on election day; one of<br>
the items on the ballot could have negatively affected the commune.  <br>
