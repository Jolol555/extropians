<i>&gt; From: Michael M. Butler &lt;butler@comp*lib.org&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An interesting notion. It's true, I don't wonder if my toenails have</i><br>
rights, <br>
<i>&gt; nor even if an astrocytoma has rights. But astrocytomas are considered </i><br>
<i>&gt; inoperable.</i><br>
<p>
There is a procedure in which an entire hemisphere of the brain is removed<br>
(its done in children, saw it in National Geographic).  Besides some<br>
problems with motor control, the children are fine.  This is of course seen<br>
as saving a life, not ending one.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I'm confused, though--you use the term "polycentric law" as if it had a </i><br>
<i>&gt; fixed meaning, then announce what it will be "more like". Help me out, </i><br>
<i>&gt; here: what are you on about? How is "polycentric law" any more principled</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; than a kangaroo court?</i><br>
<p>
Try <a href="http://members.aol.com/t0morrow/T0Mpage/PolyJust.HTML">http://members.aol.com/t0morrow/T0Mpage/PolyJust.HTML</a>          <br>
Polycentric law is just another way of saying privately produced law.  That<br>
has been discussed recently.  Polycentric law applies to a human level of<br>
communication speeds and boundaries between individuals.  Agoric computing,<br>
while now taking into account only the desires of human beings (since the<br>
computers have no desires), will turn into a system that AIs can use to<br>
modify themselves.  Since the boundary between individuals is indefinite,<br>
polycentric law is somewhat inappropriate because the boundary between<br>
centers is blurred and privately produced law is also indefinite because<br>
what is private as opposed to what is public is also rather blurry<br>
(consider, what is going on inside my head right now is a completely<br>
private matter, even if nothing else is, but that may not be the case in<br>
the far future when high bandwidth communications construe advantages to<br>
individuals at least as a great as the advantages of forming eukaryotic<br>
cells was to various microorganisms).  Therefore, agoric computing is<br>
probably the best term.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Apart from that, where does the notion of property rights go? "Hogging</i><br>
more <br>
<i>&gt; resources than it's worth"? To whom? Than whom? Them Injuns weren't </i><br>
<i>&gt; *using* the prairie, they was jest a-*sittin'* on it. Pass the smallpox-</i><br>
<i>&gt; infected blankets. Sarge.</i><br>
<p>
The notion of rights in general is a confusing one.  If someone has no<br>
mechanisms for protecting their rights, of what use are they?  If rights<br>
must be protected to be possessed, what is the difference between wants and<br>
rights?  Privately produced law dose not care about rights anymore than<br>
does democracy.  What PPL does have is a better chance of coming up with a<br>
libertarian society.  <br>
	In the post-biological world property would not have the same meaning as<br>
it does now.  It would more properly fit in with self ownership.  It could<br>
be said that an entity surrounding a star was the star to a certain extent<br>
because the star is internalized.  As to the ownership of raw materials and<br>
space, they would go to the first entity to get them.  In the end, they<br>
would probably be used in the most efficient way possible as more efficient<br>
uses come in from the far flung corners of the paved universe.  <br>
	Those who cut themselves off from any larger entity would miss out on the<br>
benefits of high information exchange and would probably fall behind to the<br>
point where they are incapable of defending themselves and there only use<br>
to more powerful entities is as raw material.  It is somewhat disturbing to<br>
think of beings more complex than humans as raw materials but think of the<br>
uses fish to humans.  They could do things other than feed us but feeding<br>
us is the most efficient thing they can do by our standards, and we have<br>
the fishing nets.<br>
	As to the Indians, the tragedy of the Indians was that they failed to<br>
unite in large enough groups, and they were the target of hatred, which<br>
sets aside rational cost-benefit analysis.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sounds about as ethical as Salmonella in a petri dish.</i><br>
<p>
Very possibly so.  The model for the post-biological future would probably<br>
be the ecosystem as opposed to any system of justice purely human emotions<br>
have devised.  We like to assume equality between individuals but that<br>
simply may not be possible beyond humanity.  <br>
