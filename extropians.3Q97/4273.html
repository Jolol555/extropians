<i>&gt; Jimm Legg, already an Extropian as far as I know,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and owner of the above website, expressed an interest</i><br>

<p>
Frederick, please let me say how much I admire your revelations of what<br>
it took for you to bring this debate here. I'm a rejoined extropian list<br>
member and I came here specifically for this debate because I have<br>
something to offer.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't understand what he's doing with NSPIC on</i><br>
<i>&gt; his website, nor why he's doing it.  I got the</i><br>
<p>
I don't yet understand where else you have debated NSPIC before now. I'm<br>
playing catch up with your mindset the best way I know how. I stress<br>
that there is a tacit understanding on my page whether you refuse to see<br>
it or not. At this stage of the debate my understanding of what you're<br>
doing with NSPIC is quid pro quo. I hope you're not deliberately being a<br>
evasive with your display of ignorance about my intentions. To which I<br>
will with tact rate the discontinuously significant barrier of you being<br>
a Judas Sheep in betraying others like me to the secret police of the<br>
META tag on the extropy list. <br>
<p>
I have the impression -- perhaps misguided on my part -- that you're on<br>
terms with "radically libertarian psychology," and a defender of price<br>
economics remaining in its current form. Please convince me otherwise or<br>
you will skeptically oppose me with your disbelief. Your decisions will<br>
force my loss of formulation as determined by Dramatica Theory. It's<br>
therefore important for this debate that you and the rest of the extropy<br>
list unconditionally surrender all ideas of having money and evaluate<br>
the replacement of belief in price in order to transcend the illusion of<br>
price. <br>
<p>
If this can't be done the destruction of Ingrid will cause terrible loss<br>
and retribution. If such exists "the extropy META police" now cease<br>
tactless email hiccaps during this debate, no one running interference -<br>
ok? Otherwise I hope you're prepared to declare this debate publicly<br>
exposed here on the family group known the extropian list. It is<br>
demonstrably important to realizing that forceful skill with Ingrid is<br>
my singularity's means to communicate to extropians about NSPIC. Are you<br>
aware that Tony Blair, Britain's new PM, is trained in and seems to<br>
approvs of this repertory grid technique.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; impression -- perhaps misguided on my part --</i><br>
<i>&gt; that he thinks he already knows all the elements</i><br>
<i>&gt; of NSPIC and has written them on his website.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But I couldn't find there even one of the elements</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think I've identified.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Don't jump to conclusions, this is only the circumspection phase of the<br>
debate. Tell me what you think after you "See What You Think..." Feel<br>
free to send me an updated list of your elements and the related grid<br>
values. As yet I haven't seen any. Frederick, you may have an inventory<br>
of identified elements. As these become known from your emnail, they<br>
will add to my Ingrid program and the results will change on the<br>
website. It is empirically analytical and can show consensus.<br>
<p>
This is the list elements that I have seen as this debate stands. Your<br>
seven purposes are starring at right you. If you don't think purposes<br>
are elements, then sorry to sound harsh but please back off your<br>
inappropriate use of the word 'element'. <br>
