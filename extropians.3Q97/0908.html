Are there any books which do describe this well?  If not, maybe you<br>
should write one.  Academics can hardly be expected to put in forty<br>
years like you did before they analyze things.  So its up to people<br>
like you to set them straight.  <br>
<p>
I am especially interested in this issue because there's a good chance<br>
I'll be a professor of political science within the next two years.<br>
