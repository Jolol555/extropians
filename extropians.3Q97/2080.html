Today, we build computers to help us think.<br>
<p>
Tomorrow, we will create devices which more capability to "think" (whatever<br>
*that* means) than humans have today.<br>
<p>
Will they be our slaves, and should their creators be shunned by society?<br>
<p>
I went through a phase of being vegan (vegetarian pure) on the grounds that<br>
I didn't want to get eaten by aliens who used the same excuse that humans<br>
often do for cows and sheep. But then I figured: hey, in a thousand years'<br>
time, I'll probably be able to create cows inside my own body at will.<br>
Surely they will be *my* cows? And if so, then what difference that the<br>
cows are in a field rather than in my body? Surely they are still *my*<br>
cows? Hmm ...<br>
<p>
I still don't eat cows (well, not much), but I wondered what you thought<br>
about it. And, since the reasoning seems the same, whether you think that<br>
tomorrow's computers should be called slaves.<br>
<p>
