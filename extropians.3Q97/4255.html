<i>&gt; &gt;With this message I'm launching a debate on NSPIC. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;NSPIC = Neuro-Semantic Political Illusion Complex. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Later in this message I give a brief description </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of what I mean by NSPIC. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That enough of us deify political structures as to create </i><br>

<i>&gt; seems quite evident.</i><br>
<p>
I tend to agree yet will point to this heretical order as being opposed<br>
by mystical blind faith. One of the nice things about this debate's<br>
chaotic permeability is its cognitive flexibility in allowing the<br>
irrational to oppose instead of using blind faith. This is like getting<br>
discontinuities to stick; - like the parasite in the vein that can't be<br>
flushed. This alternate view is a goal worth getting politically<br>
passionate about. I say the extropy list is good at surviving such<br>
views; providing their are no sinister motives afoot in the way this<br>
debate is being handled.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I question, though, the terminology "neuro-semantic" in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; context of these messages. Neuro-semantic operates as a technical </i><br>
<i>&gt; term in the context of general-semantics, a term that </i><br>
<i>&gt; characterizes the neural centers of our evaluations, perceptions,</i><br>
<p>
true<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; etc.. A neuro-semantic evaluation would, it seems to me, include </i><br>
<i>&gt; a self-reflexive "evaluation of the character of the evaluation" </i><br>
<i>&gt; from the highly specific perspective of human neural behaviors.</i><br>
<p>
My Ingrid Tutor goes into depth concerning the neural behaviors and<br>
their psychological counterparts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Leaving aside the appropriateness of such an evaluation in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; context of this list for the moment, I don't see that</i><br>
<p>
If you are implying that this list isn't up to communicating through my<br>
AI, called Ingrid, then I would really appreciate being put in touch<br>
with one that could. That is, providing it wasn't covert. But I repeat<br>
that "the Freeware, called The Ingrid Thought Processor", is not beyond<br>
the skills or context of this list. Mac owners, excluded of course:-{<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; self-reflexiveness explicitly illustrated in any of the posts to </i><br>
<i>&gt; this point. I find myself wondering if "neuro-semantic"</i><br>
<p>
You didn't read my analysis and website which is being upgraded during<br>
the nspic debate. There you will find me being quite self reflexive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; represents a construct for later introduction, or if the NSPIC</i><br>
<p>
Such a postponement would mean the immediate failure of the debate to<br>
address its Hard Problem as none of its initial Purposes would have been<br>
met.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; topic, as planned for presentation, has little connection with </i><br>
<i>&gt; neuro-semantics.</i><br>
<p>
This isn't and either or but many agendas have strong connections to AI<br>
models of neuro semantics. This process is sought requiring in this<br>
instance, the extropy list to act as though it were G.s. and surrender<br>
to the possibility that "the map is the territory." This Ingrid tool is<br>
surely the means to communicate because if you think it has nothing to<br>
do with neurons, please think again. The economic benefit comes in<br>
seeing how all these elements are related.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Addressing the appropriateness of the topic on various </i><br>
<i>&gt; shared-interest lists, I can comment that, to the degree that </i><br>
<i>&gt; "NSPIC" *does* involve neuro-semantic considerations, it may have</i><br>
<p>
To bring in this new element which Ingrid hasn't considered yet is worth<br>
pursuing. However, the neuro-semantic portions in such a wide field as<br>
extropianism is so small and vital, yet is dominated by ruling class<br>
extropians. I don't know about others but I came to the NSPIC debate<br>
from Lloyd Miller's New Paradigms Discussion Group which is able to<br>
handle such extropians without bloodshed. But the debate now has it's<br>
own life. I won't stand by and see Lloyd Millers high value discussions<br>
spilt asunder with people being scattered in all directions. Whether or<br>
not some sinister people would order a dupe storm to kill this thread, I<br>
for one get much better information treatment at prj@mail.msen.com than<br>
I have ever had from the extropy gauntlet and would go back there<br>
licking my wounds. But at least I'd nail my bragging rights into my<br>
website, again.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; an appropriate 'home' on a list dedicated to general semantics. </i><br>
<i>&gt; (I would forward the name of an appropriate list-manager upon </i><br>
<i>&gt; request in order that the appropriateness of such a discussion </i><br>
<i>&gt; might receive at least a preliminary evaluation of "appropriate </i><br>
<i>&gt; for the list.")</i><br>
<p>
This thread can be cross threaded by all means as far as I'm concerned.<br>
But I can't conceive of an ethical reason why this should be blocked,<br>
by_any_means, from the extropy list until such time as consensus says it<br>
should. While there exist difficulties communicating "with the current<br>
style of the Extropy Institute," I personally would feel cheated by<br>
having gone to the trouble of joining extropy. I can't know who else<br>
came from where to join Frederick Mann. I think he was courteous to make<br>
the invitation so that many could be in sync with the beginning of the<br>
thread. I don't know about your thread management but I still don't see<br>
any wrong intentions in starting this debate the way he did. If so, tell<br>
me and I will include the sentiments in tomorrow's update.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Moving to such a list, though, might represent a bit of a problem </i><br>
<i>&gt; for stirring up political passions. G.s. doesn't seem to lead to </i><br>
<i>&gt; passion, but rather to careful analysis of both evidence and human </i><br>
<i>&gt; analytic methodologies. The passivity of agreement with </i><br>
<i>&gt; philosophical perspectives tends not to find a fertile ground in </i><br>
<i>&gt; such a context.</i><br>
<p>
One transcendence gained from not moving, might be the resulting<br>
unfalsifiable prediction of an overturn of one or more of the current<br>
contenders for statism. This move however, might also sidestep the<br>
predatory nature in which this thread maybe being handled. And as it<br>
there now an identified purpose to, I quote, "develop the means to<br>
communicate about NSPIC to extropians," what you suggest sounds odd. <br>
<p>
Given that many extropians are Uploaders who now question the "nothing<br>
surer than death" meme. Given that the MURG neuroscientists speak for<br>
the elite in their attempts to delay uploading. Given the extropian idea<br>
of 'singularity' and given that MURG's mind uploading timetable is<br>
distinctly out of sync with extropian timetables, then I vote for the<br>
discussion to stay in the extropy list in order to properly present the<br>
models to G.s.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would find it useful to have some framework, some evaluative </i><br>
<i>&gt; model, presented in the context of NSPIC. Think of the framework</i><br>
<p>
This is my evaluative model contribution and I hope you find it useful.<br>
<p>
<a href="http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~income/ekus/nspic.html">http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~income/ekus/nspic.html</a><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; as a specific experimental procedure, or, if more appropriate, as </i><br>
<i>&gt; a specific theory from which we might draw predictions and thus a </i><br>
<p>
It might even be called Conspiracy Theory.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; path towards falsification. Such a framework would, itself, stand </i><br>
<i>&gt; as susceptible to criticism, both for its evaluative </i><br>
<p>
As I said in my background however, Ingrid is not a reductio ad absurdum<br>
as my hubris claims it is and it is now surfacing on the Internet as a<br>
result of much  rubbishing and destruction of AI's other critical tools.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; appropriateness and for its appropriateness in the context of this </i><br>
<i>&gt; list.</i><br>
<p>
The context of this list is about chaos and control in the future. I<br>
think it's time to reconsider the political and economic foundations of<br>
the ruling ideology in the extropian list. Because appropriateness is<br>
also what I have in mind, please, when you check Ingrid out just don't<br>
frighten the guys who are into Personal Construct Theory on the PCP<br>
list.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;"The word is not the thing, the map is not the territory"</i><br>
<p>
This is where the Ingrid map of neuro semantics comes alive for me, in<br>
that I see through it the future of my own multi-agent awareness. As you<br>
will hopefully want to know me better, you will see why I disagree with<br>
what I see as the illusion in your sig. Alas, my death is the thing that<br>
will stop me being the map. After all is said and done this the debate I<br>
felt should be here in this space. This is why I joined.<br>
