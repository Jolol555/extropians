I suppose there's some importance in the stuff bellow::::&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
We'll, I ve already said, lots of times, I'm an "unreconvertable" atheist,<br>
since I'm a positive one...<br>
<p>
Another subject which I always defend is the possibility of ressurrection<br>
via "past" scanning, reinstalling the structure of humans already consumed<br>
by bacteria, fire, acid, etc...  <br>
<p>
Anyway, a very great and important problem has always been on my mind:<br>
<p>
 "When" science solves the problem of ressurrection, Y should people of<br>
future ressurrect myself (and lots of yourselves too... )???<br>
<p>
Some possibilities are:<br>
<p>
1. I'll have been important enough to be remembered by them, in the future,<br>
and they'll be interested in my ressurrection.<br>
<p>
2. I'll have become myself rich enough to keep some kind of foundation, to<br>
provide resources necessary for "solve it by myself" <br>
<p>
3. They, in the future, will have opted for ressurrecting the majority of<br>
people, at least after some point of the "sapiens age"...<br>
<p>
<p>
Well:<br>
<p>
- about (1), depends on me to do something, like, f. ex., shouting aloud (<br>
and naked... hehe) all these ideas, from the top of  Tour Eiffel, or Liberty<br>
Statue, etc (kidding...)<br>
<p>
- about (2), very improbable to a sci and, worse, a teacher too..<br>
<p>
- so, just rests (3):  but, knowing capitalist society enough, the<br>
supposition of so much fraternity to using their resources to ressurrecting<br>
so much people is really hilary... (not Clinton, sorry...). They (we) do not<br>
even avoid that  niggers from starving and dieing in Africa, or elsewhere...<br>
and this is much cheaper... easier... and already feasible... But...<br>
suddenly, yesterday, came to my mind ( I even took it by myself... nothing<br>
of religious interpretations, please...)  a great conclusion::::&gt;  If (when)<br>
science really gets to ressurrect people from the past ( in the future )<br>
they will obviously ressurrect Jesus, which, certainly will make a PhD, and<br>
will understand lots of real things of the world and existence... If, after<br>
that, he still continue on being a "good brother" ( even after of<br>
disappointing on not being  in heaven, like the supposed "Lord"), he'll<br>
possibly work for being elected as, f.ex. the 1st Min of the Earth... and so<br>
ressurrect all of his "brothers" (us, of course....hehehe) ... For other<br>
side, he also said "who believes in me will ressurrect, get ethernal life<br>
and go to heaven on my side... who not, won't..." Well, hope he'll<br>
reconsider...hehehe...  or, anyway... I'll trust in inteligence and will be<br>
certainly ressurrected thanks to another guys.... f.ex. Galileo, Voltaire,<br>
etc, etc.... Anyway, I suppode have found the possible better application<br>
for Jesus story...&gt;&gt;&gt; take fraternal behaviours, at least to that point in<br>
the future... ( I think  will write a "FP - future possibility"( ex sci-fi)<br>
book...)<br>
<p>
<p>
That's serious and ... strategic..., folks.....<br>
<p>

Sin,<br>
