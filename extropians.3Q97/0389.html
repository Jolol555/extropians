<p>
Lilly also didn't like this entity and thought its aims were inhuman.<br>
Note that The Scientist also mentions some of Lilly's childhood, which<br>
was, to say the least, dismal. There's a well known psychological<br>
mechanism known as projection in which despised parts of one's own<br>
experience are seen as external agencies. LSD and other psychedelics<br>
(including Ketamine) amplify inner experience, and this includes<br>
projections.<br>
<p>
Of course the Extropian and Transhuman view is to embrace this<br>
developing entity, either as a symbiosis or extension of the future<br>
self, a POV which I find preferable....<br>
