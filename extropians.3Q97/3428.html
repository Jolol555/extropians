<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; True. This is the major reason I don't think market solutions</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yes, this is true, but the only alternative usually presented</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to market solutions is political solutions, which have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; exact same failings: political systems can organise to produce</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; good results for other entities than humans, such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; governments.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Good point. I have been looking at the Swedish political arena</i><br>
<i>&gt; for some time, and it is very clear that it is not intended for </i><br>
<i>&gt; the benefits of humans, just a group of organizations. After all,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we do not elect individual politicians, just their parties,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and through memetic selection organizations which make the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fitness lansdcape nicer for organizations will prosper. There</i><br>
<i>&gt; are some interesting cases of co-evolution and symbiosis </i><br>
<i>&gt; (I suppose one could call it conspiracy, but I prefer a biological</i><br>
<i>&gt; formalism) which leads to the formation of stable structures</i><br>
<i>&gt; with very little interest in individual humans. Of course,</i><br>
<i>&gt; many humans adapt to this to get maximal benefit from the present</i><br>
<i>&gt; structures, creating career politicians, bureaucrats and wellfare-</i><br>
<i>&gt; addicts.</i><br>
<p>
I had the rather stupid meme that politicians on Nordic countries were<br>
better than in the other countries. You are very wealthy, have rather<br>
small countries (compared to the other wealthy countries in the world)<br>
and seem to support your leaders more than in other countries such as<br>
the US. Perhaps the majority of the people are manipulated by<br>
corporations and politicians just as in every other country and the<br>
people with whom I've talked to and the things I read are related to<br>
this persons. Still with the level of education you have, you are bound<br>
to be, on average, more intelligent and less susceptible to this<br>
manipulations. What do you think of it?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; All in all, it seems that our problem is that we have metaorganisms</i><br>
<i>&gt; around that doesn't help, and often hinder, transhuman progress.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The big question is how to deal with this, and what kinds of interactions</i><br>
<i>&gt; (and ethics) we should develop between individuals and metaorganisms.</i><br>
<p>
IMHO, the key is to educate the people, to develop, to make the people<br>
more intelligent (probably by genetic engineering as well) so that they<br>
can't be as easy manipulated.<br>
<p>
Governmental changes might also be a good idea, to allow some people to<br>
have more votes than others (because of their higher education and/or<br>
achievements in professional life), to give more power to local<br>
government and create a system where people actually meet their<br>
representatives, you know, the usual governmental reforms that everyone<br>
talks about.<br>
<p>
I'll have to study a bit more of economy to fully develop an opinion<br>
about this matter.<br>
