<i>&gt;Do you know of any books or papers specifically discussing the survival of</i><br>
<i>&gt;organisms over extremely long time-spans?</i><br>
<p>
There was a letter to Nature a few months ago that discussed the possiblity<br>
of life spreading throughout the galaxy via the spread of spores. The idea<br>
was that a sizeable impact with Earth, or like body, would put some spores<br>
into space. I can't remember the details, but the idea was that if you<br>
assume a small piece of soot with spores inside you could expect them to<br>
survive millions of years. Once in space they would slowly spread outwards<br>
from the sun under the pressure of solar radiation until they perhaps<br>
reached another solar system and fell to a planet with suitable conditions;<br>
where they could start the process of life all over, or perhaps out compete<br>
whatever organisms had evolved separately.<br>
<p>
best,  patrick<br>
