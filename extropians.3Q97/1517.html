<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; reductionism is a hypothesis....actually he may be unconsciously</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; carrying a meme of the currently dominant scientific establishment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Wasn't it he who first pointed out that memetics was a meme too?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     So?  What does that have to do with his failure to look at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; characteristics of the whole engendered by the meme?  Memes that</i><br>
<i>&gt; engender war, for instance, may create a successful Imperialist culture</i><br>
<i>&gt; that spreads through military force.  Just look at history.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, so what? Dawkins isn't especially interested in memetics, his<br>
speciality is evolution. But others are obviously aware that memes<br>
create changes that in turn affect them, there is a lot of<br>
co-evolution out there. An obvious example is how new media create<br>
new forms of memes, and these memes affect the media. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; However, only the rich and powerful segments of a society can make</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; a new meme operational through a whole culture (hypothesis alert!</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Begin testing it!).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Counterexample: Kilroy was here. Was started by some soldiers, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; was so efficient that it spread across most of the western culture.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     But it wasn't important!  "Kilroy" imparted no important</i><br>
<i>&gt; characteristics to Western Culture.</i><br>
<p>
OK, what about Copernicus theory? It was not supported by the rich<br>
and powerful, yet it spread and eventually became dominant. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Contrary to popular Extropian thought, then, the meme's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; "attraction" for the host is less important than the physical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; resources available for propagating the new meme.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; No. Let's make a BOTE mathematical model for memetic spread in a very</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; large population (assumed infinite in this case). Let x(t) be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; number of people infected with the meme at time t. They infect other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; people at a constant rate k.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Assumption is wrong....law of diminishing returns sets in...meme</i><br>
<i>&gt; spread slows down after a long time if there is no resistance, quickly</i><br>
<i>&gt; if the establishment uses its power to squelch it early.</i><br>
<p>
I was ignoring that, since I don't have the time to make a realistic<br>
model right now. But the model can of course easily be extended to a<br>
finite population, with resistance gradually building up. See any<br>
standard epidemologic textbook. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Notice how the Establishment periodically cracks down on</i><br>
<i>&gt; "conspiracy theory memes"?  Conspiracy memes are quite infectious</i><br>
<i>&gt; (partly because there is a large element of truth) but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Establishment fights back hard through Foundation supported</i><br>
<i>&gt; propaganda every time they start to gain momentum. </i><br>
<p>
Conspiracy theory memes are interesting in themselves (lots of clever<br>
strategies to replicate, including the ability to explain away lack<br>
of evidence, "us vs. them", becoming stronger by being persecuted<br>
etc.). But I think you are infected by a conspiracy theory meme<br>
yourself in this case: what is the evidence that the estabilishment<br>
cracks down on conspiracy theories more often than other memes? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; There is also some agency which spreads</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the meme deliberately, infecting new hosts at a rate l. Assume that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; infections last for life. Then we get the differential equation:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     This second assumption is even more wrong than the first!  New memes</i><br>
<i>&gt; have no such staying power....seen many "Kilroys" lately?</i><br>
<p>
I suggest that you read my paper about the lifecycle of memes for a<br>
better discussion of it. My assumption above was of course an<br>
oversimplification, but the model was intended to show my point, not<br>
to be qualitatively correct. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; x'(t)= kx(t)+l</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This has the solution x(t)=c exp(kt) + (l/k). Note that the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; term, corresponding to the exponential spread of the meme</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; person-to-person will overrun the second corresponding to outside</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; insertion quite quickly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     So!  The rationalization against "ruling class/conspiracy" theory</i><br>
<i>&gt; fails.  Admit it!  You just want to be in memetic resonance with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; powers that be!  ...the manipulators of the State!</i><br>
<p>
This is too bad, I don't have the time to analyse your statements<br>
more in detail to show how your reaction easily could be deduced from<br>
the conspiracy meme you are carrying. Anyway, what I believe doesn't<br>
matter, look at the facts instead. <br>
