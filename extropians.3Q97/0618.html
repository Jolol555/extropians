<i>&gt;  &gt;Can we have a spontaneous order in business?  Could we destroy the</i><br>
hierarchic<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;structure that plagues current business practise and have a looser, more</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;anarchic spontaneous order?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  There are many people who argue that this is already happening.  Tom</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Malone, and his MIT Center for Coordination Science (<a href="http://ccs.mit.edu/">http://ccs.mit.edu/</a>),</i><br>
<i>&gt;  think that networked information technology (what we're all usin' here) is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  enabling more market-like business structures to replace hierarchical</i><br>
ones.<br>
<i>&gt;   It's most obvious manifestation is more outsourcing and the rise in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  individual consulting, which is what I do.  You also see more large</i><br>
<i>&gt;  businesses breaking into independant profit&amp;loss units.</i><br>
<p>
I agree, when I talk of anarchy in any situation I do not mean some wild<br>
revolution to destroy hierarchy and free individuals.  I'm talking of a<br>
gradual evolution.  We may not have to anything to get to an anarchic system,<br>
the evolution has begun and it doesn't look like it's going to stop...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;I see this as a possibility, companies could be considered a group of</i><br>
equally<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;ranked individuals all serving the same goal.  This would be easily</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;implemented within creative environments, which will probably dominate in</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;near future due to automation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Mind you, it might be my management hat talking, but I don't think it will</i><br>
<i>&gt;  move in the direction you describe.  There may not be bosses and workers,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  but there will still be customers and vendors.  Think of the independant</i><br>
<i>&gt;  consultant model again.  When I consult for Company B, the designer or</i><br>
<i>&gt;  producer isn't my boss, but they decide what they want me to produce for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  them (though likely with advice from me), and if I agree then I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;  contractually obligated to produce that.  And I want to, because it will</i><br>
<i>&gt;  lead to repeat business and a good reputation.  On the other hand, if I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  have lots of clients and I am not happy with how Comany B worked, then I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  can turn them down the next time they have a project.</i><br>
<p>
Now imagine everyone was an individual manufacturer (of a product or<br>
service).  You choose what to make or do, when someone else wants a service<br>
or product they come to you.  You choose the price and product, then you put<br>
it on the market.  If your product doesn't sell you're going to change it,<br>
you're going to lower the price or manufacture something completely<br>
different.  The whole system works as it does now, except we have done away<br>
with the hierarchical structure of business.<br>
<p>
Let's say you choose to design and build aircraft.  Obviously you alone<br>
cannot do all the work, so you decide to find like-minded individuals.  What<br>
forms is not a company (as we know it), but a group of individuals working<br>
towards goal.  The agreements between each member of the group can be<br>
different.  You can work for money (a value you set), you can work in<br>
exchange for other goods, you can work out of the kindness of your heart or<br>
you can work because I have a gun pointed at your head (community service).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  (You also need systems that allow the customer to coordinate the schedules</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and products of many different vendors, and to choose between cost and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  quality of various potential vendors.  That's what Tom talks about.)</i><br>
<p>
The market of the future will be very different.  As the market would be<br>
constantly changing we would require computer agents to shop around for us;<br>
it's likely that brand names and marketing will not have the importance they<br>
have today.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt;To take this a step further: Could these ideas also be applied to</i><br>
education,<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;an anarchic schooling system?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  David Friedman has an essay in Machinery of Freedom on a</i><br>
anarcho-capitalist<br>
<i>&gt;  education system.  You should check that out, though it's mostly applied</i><br>
to<br>
<i>&gt;  college.</i><br>
<p>
So much to read...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Personally, I would love to see a world where 18 year olds could</i><br>
<i>&gt;  get reasonable jobs without going to annother four years of school.</i><br>
<p>
How about a world were school is a place you go to voluntarily?  With the<br>
marking scheme I've outlined below education could be done at home (or<br>
anywhere else).  Schools would become a place where you go to socialize and<br>
use special equipment (the school and library systems could merge into a<br>
community education center).  You can leave at anytime, you can gain<br>
qualifications at anytime and you can return for further education at<br>
anytime.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  [snip] There are many students who need a fair amount of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  structure to acheive, myself included.  What I'd rather see is a variety</i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt;  types of learning environments, so parents and students could choose the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  approach that worked best for them.</i><br>
<p>
Or have you learnt the need for structure?<br>
<p>
The entire purpose of anarchy is to allow you to take your own approach to<br>
what ever it is you want to do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  So, in an anarchic (or market-like) school, what do you have to show the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  employers?  You need something more consise that the entire portfolio of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  work, and you'd like something that helps them rank you in relation to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  other applicants.  The option our federal government like is to create one</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Great Standard Tesk of All Knowledge, but that's likely to dictate how</i><br>
<i>&gt;  children are made to learn and doesn't help in specialized fields.  I'd</i><br>
<i>&gt;  rather start thinking from the employer's perspective, of what they need</i><br>
to<br>
<i>&gt;  know.  Any ideas?</i><br>
<p>
When a student decides to study, it would usually be done through an<br>
interactive program running on a computer.  Because the program isn't<br>
passive, it can ask questions and test the student.  Just by simply<br>
interacting with the computer, the student is awarded certificates; the<br>
students need never know they are being tested.  This would also mean that<br>
students can work at their own pace, a smart student could be a doctor by the<br>
end of the day just by reading up on medicine and interacting with some<br>
medical simulations.  These certificate systems need not just be installed in<br>
schools, imagine if all the information you read in books could go towards a<br>
qualification, as you read!<br>
<p>
I plan to send a more detailed post about how this will all work in the<br>
future.<br>
