As Drexler has said, there is a difference between know-how and <br>
know-what. But yes, they will have an advantage -- an advantage <br>
relative to the state of the leading power before it had developed <br>
nanotech. But relative to the state of the leading power at the time <br>
in question, they would of course still be at a disadvantage.<br>
<p>
<p>
We need to clarify the issue:<br>
<p>
Let's simplify and assume that we can get to advanced nanotech <br>
through the sequence of discoveries N0,  N1, ..., Na...<br>
<p>
In no particular order:<br>
<p>
N(1997) is where we are today.<br>
<p>
Nredgoo-i is where universally destructive goo of generation i can be <br>
made. (i=0 is red goo that could extinguish all intelligent life if <br>
there were no immune system.)<br>
<p>
Nimmune-i is where a (global) immune system can be build <br>
to deal with red goo of generation i or lower.<br>
<p>
Nimmune-abc is where a good nanodefence against ABC and conventional <br>
warfare is possible<br>
<p>
Nsuperintelligence is where superintelligence can be built.<br>
<p>
Ncad++ is where nanotech gives substantial imrovements to nanodesign <br>
computers (hardware of software)<br>
<p>
Ncommersial is where nanotech can be used to make large commersial <br>
profits (&gt;1 billion$)<br>
<p>
Ngeneralassembler --self explanatory<br>
<p>
etc.<br>
<p>
<p>
It seems that what you are arguing is that even if <br>
N(leader)&gt;&gt;N(competition) at some early stage, it still holds <br>
that (F1), for every i, <br>
<p>
if<br>
(N(leader)&gt;=Nredgoo-i and N(leader)&gt;=Nimmune-abc)<br>
then<br>
N(competition)&gt;=Nimmune-i or there is a j such <br>
that N(competition)&gt;=Nredgoo-j and N(leader)&lt;Nimmune-j<br>
<p>
Design-ahead efforts might mean that when enabling technologies <br>
arrive, a lot of designs can be immediately implemented.<br>
<p>
Advancement of technology means shorter design-cycles means a given <br>
cronological time difference corresponds to a greater technological <br>
lag. If not sooner, this design-cycle acceleration will occur when <br>
machine intelligence begins to be developed.<br>
<p>
These are reasons against (F1)<br>
<p>
But even if (F1) were true, it would still not follow that we <br>
could have a stable multipolar nanotech world order. Military balance <br>
need not imply military stability. Two fighting men with guns pointed <br>
to each other's heads are in power balance, but their situation isn't <br>
stable. (This example is from Drexler.) It takes an aditional <br>
argument to establish  (F2) that a first strike won't be <br>
successful.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(If you would</i><br>
<i>&gt; care to claim that it is possible to profit from an advance in nanotech</i><br>

<p>
Good. Note that it is not necessary for my position that such <br>
commersal benefit is possible. However, I think it is. We could for <br>
example mass produce certain medicines that can also be made without <br>
nanotech but only at great cost. The same holds for a number of other <br>
products. We could even sell things that aren't possible to make <br>
without nanotech without revealing too much about how we bootstraped <br>
the tools necessary to make them.<br>
