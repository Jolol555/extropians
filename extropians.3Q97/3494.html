But consider the life insurance policy as a way of storing up value. At<br>
maturation, you can convert the polcy to cash. If you die before then (due<br>
to mishap, not diet or lifestyle), you can get frozen. If people are<br>
immortal before then, you cash it in early.<br>
<p>
It's not as black and white as you paint it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is what I mean. Before signing up (if &amp; when this becomes possible in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Holland) </i><br>
<p>
You mean it's legally impossible in the Netherlands today? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I must be convinced that the best way to spend $50K - $120K is</i><br>
<i>&gt; freezing my head then I will. </i><br>
<p>
It's a hedge. Are you healthy? How much is the government (or are you)<br>
spending on health insurance? Why, if you're healthy? Isn't there<br>
something better to do with all that money?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From where I stand now these are large</i><br>
<i>&gt; amounts and at this point I believe there are better ways to spend that</i><br>
<i>&gt; kind of money. Preferrebly  I'd like to use it myself on something usefull</i><br>
<i>&gt; or fun, but maybe it will help people I care about. Or maybe there will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; a doctor in Kathmandu who's fighting lepracy that has some use for</i><br>
<i>&gt; $100.000, save a few lives (for sure!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The bottom line is that I consider the revival chances at this time to low</i><br>
<i>&gt; to spend money on in view of alternative use of such a resource.</i><br>
<p>
The bottom line is that the money isn't spent until you de-animate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'll be following cryo-technology with interest.</i><br>
<p>
Please do!<br>
