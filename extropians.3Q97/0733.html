I had to think about it for a while, but now I'm pretty sure I don't agree with<br>
this.  All I had to do was reflect on some of my favorite stand-up comedy<br>
routines, and many examples came to me that weren't puns, and which didn't have<br>
anything to do with pain.  Here is but one example.<br>
<p>
Norm McDonald once made fun of the winter olympic event known as the<br>
"biathalon," which is a combination of cross-country skiing and rifle<br>
marksmanship.  Ski, shoot, ski, shoot.  The humor Norm found in that was all<br>
the other types of sports we might similarly make up.  We could, say, sprint<br>
100 meters, and... fish.<br>
<p>
No pain or puns.  Just absurdity and comic timing.<br>
