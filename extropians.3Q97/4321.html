That article is not online, as you would know by now if you had done what I<br>
did (on your behalf) and consulted a Web search engine.  On the other hand,<br>
you might try asking Dejanews for posts that combine `Dogon' and `Sirius'.<br>
There is a long thread which deals with most of the obvious points.<br>
<p>
But hey, don't knock yourself out.  Who knows, if you keep asking somebody<br>
might drop by your school with a free library of skeptical texts.  Look,<br>
why don't I just fly over from Australia with a copy of BROCA'S BRAIN and<br>
read it to you at home?<br>
<p>
(Calm down, Damien.  Calm down.  There, that's better.  Just let the<br>
Atlantean vibrations flow through, awakening the inner dolphin.  Ahhhhh)<br>
