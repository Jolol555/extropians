In a message dated 97-09-12 00:02:01 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; eople, or relative to how we</i><br>
<i>&gt;  were in the past or will be in the future.  Game theory experiments have</i><br>
<i>&gt;  shown that people tend to go for outcomes which improve their standing</i><br>
<i>&gt;  compared to other players, rather than those which maximize their own</i><br>
<i>&gt;  personal expected gains.  Presumably this is a heuristic which has been</i><br>
<i>&gt;  successful in making choices in the past.  If you can do better than the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  guy in the next cave, you're doing pretty well.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  But as a result, as long as there are differences in outcomes, there</i><br>
<i>&gt;  will be those who feel unhappy that other people are doing better than</i><br>
<i>&gt;  themselves. </i><br>
<p>
And a lot of grief it causes... <br>
<p>
Thank you for your considered posting. You seem to be very level headed and<br>
informed. It is nice to see someone expand on ideas rather than do a feedback<br>
loop so they can recylcle  a prescription of already prepared ideas.<br>
<p>
I have (temporarily?) unsubscribed to the list because I lost precious time (<br>
oops! missed some homework assignments, was late to school) responding to<br>
people who seem to not want to listen...  and also due to this weird list<br>
bounceback mail. I will read the archives and look for your posts. <br>
