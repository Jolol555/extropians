Jim Legg &lt;income@ihug.co.nz&gt; writes, to Frederick Mann:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have the impression -- perhaps misguided on my part -- that you're on</i><br>
<i>&gt; terms with "radically libertarian psychology," and a defender of price</i><br>
<i>&gt; economics remaining in its current form. Please convince me otherwise or</i><br>
<i>&gt; you will skeptically oppose me with your disbelief. Your decisions will</i><br>
<i>&gt; force my loss of formulation as determined by Dramatica Theory.</i><br>
<p>
I'm sorry, but this is not comprehensible.  Maybe Jim Legg, Frederick<br>
Mann and Wesley Burt could go off somewhere and hash out whose Great<br>
Insight will be the one which truly lets us cast off our shackles.<br>
<p>
We have a list policy against debating "the basics", and it sounds like<br>
Legg and Burt are interested in supporting government intervention in<br>
private business relationships.  We just got finished with a round of this<br>
with our Dutch friends, but at least they were reasonably open-minded.<br>
Reading the rants of Burt and Legg makes me doubt that there is much<br>
chance of a satisfactory outcome.<br>
