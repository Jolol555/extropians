Something that may be a likely development is<br>
a "genie machine" or "wish-granting machine".<br>
Every machine that does what you want it to<br>
is already a machine for granting a (narrow)<br>
range of wishes; what I mean is a sort of<br>
general-purpose wish-granting machine.<br>
Imagine a machine with superintelligence<br>
and maximal abilities to construct physical<br>
systems (whether that be nanotech or something<br>
more advanced, such as the creation of designer<br>
universes), but no volition to speak of.<br>
What should one ask of such a machine?<br>
What *shouldn't* one ask for?<br>
