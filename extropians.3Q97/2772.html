<i>&gt; &gt;self-replicators we are trying to build need not be optimised in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sense that cars need to be, if they are to be acceptable to car </i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;steerable automobiles on four wheels or something like that; not to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;car that could be sold today.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Ok, that makes sense. It seems that we have exhausted the power of <br>
analogies now, though. We know that making a nanotech <br>
self-replicator, even given perfect atomic positioning, would be <br>
non-trivial. It would be useful if it were possible to come to a <br>
slightly more precise conlusion, say about the order of magnitude of <br>
the number of "genius-years" required. We would need to take into <br>
account the possibility of developing better computers that could <br>
help in simulations, and other enabling technologies.<br>
Atomic positioning, and atomic monitoring, are prehaps just around <br>
the corner. The STM and AFM achive this in a very imperfect manner, <br>
but some good gripp-molecules to be placed on the tip of the needle <br>
could possibly be developed within a few years. How long will it take <br>
after that untill we have ab initio self-replicators? Ten, fifteen <br>
years? 2015? I suppose that most of the action would happen in the <br>
last few years, when there would be frenetic activity in labs all <br>
over the world. By 2010 we should have some pretty impressive CAD <br>
which would give extra acceleration to the process. Drexler tends to <br>
avoid predictions about when things are going to happen, but if <br>
pressed he says he believes that we will have a general assembler <br>
sometime during the first third of the next century, and more likely <br>
in the earlier part than in the later part of this interval.  Hmm. On <br>
my transhuman home page I say that I believe there is at least a 50% <br>
chance that we will have superhuman artificial intelligence within 50 <br>
years. Perhaps I should strengthen this to 30 years?<br>
