<i>&gt;I heard in passing recently, that you can now buy and trade stocks,</i><br>

<p>
You can buy t-bills directly from the Treasury department.  The only way<br>
I know of to buy stocks without a broker is with a Super-DRIP.  A number<br>
of campanies have set up these programs so that you can buy stock<br>
directly from the company.<br>
<p>
I believe that the American Association of Independant Investors (I<br>
*think* that's the name) can point you in the right direction.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, is there a way (even in the works) of buying and selling in very</i><br>
<i>&gt;small chunks?  In other words, wouldn't it make more sense if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;economy wuld allow invesment in increments of penny's?  For example, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;want to invest $2.36 in Microsoft.  But, as I understand things, you</i><br>
<i>&gt;have to pay at least in blocks of $140 (the price its currently</i><br>
<i>&gt;selling at) or not at all.  This seems to be a very inefficent and</i><br>
<i>&gt;non-fluid restriction and one that favors the rich investor over the</i><br>
<i>&gt;poor one.</i><br>
<p>
There is no way that I know of to buy sub-shares.<br>
<p>
The phenomenon you mention is exactly why stocks tend to rise after they<br>
split: the split causes greater liquidity.<br>
<p>

Please note that my domain name is hacked in the header as an anti-spam<br>
measure.  If you want to send me mail directly, please change the domain<br>
name to "rpeck".  Yes, the same as the email address.  Thanks.<br>
