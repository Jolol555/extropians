Au contraire, mon frere.<br>

My message was memetically Engineered, using virulent CAPITAL LETTERS. ;-)<br>

Science is philosophy, do you disagree?<br>
 <br>

<i>&gt; People who study science are artists; people who study art are not.</i><br>
<p>
I'm glad you said it and not me ;)<br>
<p>
I remember reading somewhere about all the scientific blunders made by<br>
artists/authors.  Like in Lord of the Flies where they light a fire using<br>
Piggy's glasses, which were the wrong type of lens to focus light.  There<br>
was some other famous novel that describes an open trellis of water that<br>
goes uphill.  Pretty silly.<br>
