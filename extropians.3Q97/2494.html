   By Charles Ornstein / The Dallas Morning News <br>
   The Kaufman County sheriff, reacting to a botched drug raid last week<br>
   in which deputies stormed the wrong Terrell house and strip-searched<br>
   two innocent women, has replaced his head narcotics investigator and<br>
   vowed Sunday to take other action to prevent such mistakes.<br>
   <br>
   Sheriff Robert Harris said Sunday that Capt. George Pelphrey will no<br>
   longer head the department's narcotics investigations. The sheriff<br>
   said he hasn't decided whether he will further discipline Capt.<br>
   Pelphrey, a 15-year department veteran, for approving last Tuesday's<br>
   raid of June Nixon's house on Sue Lane.<br>
   <br>
   Ms. Nixon, 57, and her 28-year-old daughter, Melissa Cheek, were<br>
   watching television about 7 p.m. Tuesday when 15 Kaufman County<br>
   deputies burst through the front door.<br>
   <br>
   They handcuffed both women, and then a female deputy strip-searched<br>
   them in front of Ms. Cheek's 6-year-old daughter, Sheriff Harris said.<br>
   <br>
   Capt. Pelphrey, who heads the criminal investigation division, could<br>
   not be reached for comment Sunday. But the sheriff defended the<br>
   officer's record.<br>
   <br>
   "He's very well-informed, he's very well-trained and he's done an<br>
   outstanding job over the years," Sheriff Harris said. "This is just<br>
   one of those things that we have to investigate to see if maybe he<br>
   didn't do everything he should have done. We just don't know that."<br>
   <br>
   The real drug suspects, who live down the street, watched the raid<br>
   from their front lawn, Sheriff Harris said, and laughed as deputies<br>
   passed by. Those suspects had not been arrested by Sunday, but the<br>
   sheriff said they would be.<br>
   <br>
   The deputies realized that they had entered the wrong home when they<br>
   did not find weapons or drugs on Ms. Nixon or Ms. Cheek, the sheriff<br>
   said. Officers offered to fix the front door, he said, but Ms. Nixon,<br>
   a schoolteacher, turned down the help.<br>
   <br>
   Ms. Nixon and her daughter would not speak to reporters Sunday. Their<br>
   lawyer, Hunt Bonneau of Dallas, said they were considering a lawsuit<br>
   against Kaufman County.<br>
   <br>
   "They're your all-American family," Mr. Bonneau said. "That's what's<br>
   scary about this. You elect your officials and you pay those guys to<br>
   protect you. And those are the very people that are coming in and<br>
   intruding on you. We're all kind of in awe at this point."<br>
   <br>
   Sheriff Harris said he will finish an investigation into the incident<br>
   Monday or Tuesday. He won't decide on any action against Capt.<br>
   Pelphrey until then, he said. No other officers are under<br>
   investigation, the sheriff said.<br>
   <br>
   The sheriff also said he would now personally review any search<br>
   warrants requested by his officers. He said he hasn't done that in the<br>
   past.<br>
   <br>
   "I will take a tremendously active role in reviewing the investigative<br>
   portion before the execution of any search warrant is approved,"<br>
   Sheriff Harris said. "I want to make sure that I am hitting the right<br>
   premises."<br>
   <br>
   In last Tuesday's raid, the sheriff said, "I know we hit the wrong<br>
   house and there was some reason for it."<br>
   <br>
   Investigators are supposed to check addresses at the post office,<br>
   confirm them with water and electric records and then conduct<br>
   surveillance at the prospective home, he said. Some of those things<br>
   apparently were not done, Sheriff Harris said.<br>
   <br>
   Mr. Bonneau said his clients' civil rights were violated. He said he<br>
   is waiting on the results of his own investigation this week before<br>
   deciding whether to file a lawsuit against the county.<br>
   <br>
   He said he doesn't understand how the mistake could have happened.<br>
   <br>
   "With all the access to information that the government has, this type<br>
   of thing shouldn't happen unless there is a lack of due diligence<br>
   there," Mr. Bonneau said Sunday. "Our task is to make sure where the<br>
   breakdown was - who was lazy - and to make sure it doesn't happen<br>
   again."<br>
   <br>
   The lawyer said Ms. Nixon has lived in the house for more than 30<br>
   years. Neither she nor her daughter has a criminal history, Mr.<br>
   Bonneau said.<br>
   <br>
   The Kaufman County deputies did not show a search warrant when they<br>
   entered the house, he said, and were "pretty invasive" during the<br>
   strip search.<br>
   <br>
   Ms. Nixon and Ms. Cheek repeatedly told tactical officers that they<br>
   were law-abiding citizens, Sheriff Harris said. But because<br>
   investigators hear that all the time from true criminals, they<br>
   continued with their search, he said.<br>
   <br>
   "We've arrested people 70 years old, who look like your typical<br>
   grandmother, for cooking drug labs," he said. "The physical appearance<br>
   of an individual doesn't always denote if they are narcotics<br>
   traffickers."<br>
   <br>
   Kaufman County Commissioner Rod Kinkaid said he was troubled by the<br>
   incident.<br>
   <br>
   "It appears to be something very serious and something that we need to<br>
   make sure never happens again," said Mr. Kinkaid, who has served for<br>
   more than two years. "I'd like to know what really did go wrong and<br>
   what the details are so corrective action can be taken."<br>
   <br>
   Several searches by Kaufman County sheriff's deputies - one drug raid<br>
   and one arrest involving underage drinking - have drawn attention in<br>
   recent years.<br>
   <br>
   In 1989, Sheriff Harris publicly apologized to two families for a raid<br>
   that turned up no drugs but left two houses damaged and family members<br>
   shaken.<br>
   <br>
   Three years ago, county officials agreed to revise some rules on the<br>
   handling of prisoners after parents of Highland Park High School<br>
   students sued the county. The parents contended that officers<br>
   illegally entered private property and raided a teenage party to raise<br>
   money in fines. The county paid $65,000 in legal costs, under terms of<br>
   the settlement.<br>
   <br>
   Sheriff Harris said his department is competent and frequently trains<br>
   rural sheriff's deputies in other Texas counties. During his 12 years<br>
   as sheriff, his office has confiscated more than $40 million in<br>
   illegal drugs, he said. Deputies will not stop going after drug<br>
   targets following this incident, the sheriff said.<br>
   <br>
   "We're one of the best trained sheriff's departments in Texas," he<br>
   said. "Our officers work hard. They have a large work load. If you<br>
   make one mistake, you are certainly going to be criticized for it,<br>
   much more than the praise you get for all the good things you do."<br>
   <br>
   As for the actual drug suspects on Ms. Nixon's street, Sheriff Harris<br>
   said: "We're not going to take them off the list."<br>
