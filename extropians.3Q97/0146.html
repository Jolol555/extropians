<i>&gt; I would venture that the formation of higher-order (meta-level)</i><br>
<i>&gt; abstractions is the *purpose* of learning. I'm curious to hear your</i><br>
<i>&gt; definition of learning, and how it doesn't involve the use of high-order</i><br>
<i>&gt; abstrations.</i><br>
<p>
We may be talking past each other here. Learning is not about how many<br>
abstractions you can make. The purpose of learning is to *provide a<br>
basis* for further abstraction, extension and investigation. This is not<br>
the same thing as what you are saying. I am arguing that this is<br>
accomplished by acquiring a foundation in the *facts*, or more to the<br>
point, the things that have already been decided as probably true. From<br>
there, abstract yourself into Next Tuesday, but without the facts,<br>
you're dealing with just that, an abstraction.<br>
<p>
To say that my definition does not involve the use of higher-order<br>
abstractions is inaccurate, I merely suggest that this is not the<br>
purpose of learning, but a purpose in and of itself.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;But, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;they're inaccurate, I can't see how that helps you learn concrete facts,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;unless you ask someone about it and then they give you the correct</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;answer.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wait a second - who said high-level abstractions are inaccurate? Is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; a given?</i><br>
<p>
Notice that at first I said, "Accurate meta-level abstractions are an<br>
important part of the learning prcoess." Then I went on to say, "But if<br>
they're inaccurate, I can't see how that helps you learn concrete<br>
facts."<br>
<p>
I think this answers your question. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; I must plead E-Prime on this one. To ask what man *is* suggests that man</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; does not *become*. Knowing one's nature and the nature of the universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; in which one exists is IMO the ultimate goal. If I can finally know what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; I *am*, then I have stopped evolving. Since time doesn't stand still for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; me, I become incorrect about what I *am* only a millisecond later.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What does "pleading E-Prime" mean?</i><br>
<p>
Discursive construction from my law school days. Would you rather,<br>
"Allow me to apply E-Prime to this one," from my EMT days?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How does asking "What is man?" suggest that "Man does not become."</i><br>
<p>
If man is something then he is that thing forever. If not forever, then<br>
for how long? "What is man?" is a question that misses the boat (and<br>
also has no answer because we are evolving). I think, as I said in my<br>
earlier post, that knowing the nature of man's relationship to the<br>
universe is much more fluid and dynamic knowledge that includes my<br>
extropian and transhuman ideals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What is becoming, and how does man do it?</i><br>
<p>
Umm...look through the extropian and transhuman archives for the answer<br>
to this one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why</i><br>
<i>&gt; does one stop evolving if one learns more about one's self? </i><br>
<p>
This is a classic case of words being put in the mouth. I never said any<br>
such thing. I am merely saying that knowing what you are has zero praxis<br>
unless you are staying the same forever. Theoretically, it's nice,<br>
you'll be able to write a grand memoir. But I would rather know first<br>
what my relationship is with the universe and then *become* what I want<br>
to be. It's the difference betweeen hindsight and foresight to me.<br>
