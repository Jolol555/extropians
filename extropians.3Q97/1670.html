<i>&gt;What changes in your personal lifestyle have you taken to increase</i><br>
<i>&gt;the amount of extropy therein (changes = mental, physical, social,</i><br>
<i>&gt;etc)?</i><br>
<p>
Health:<br>
--I preferably drink only (fizzy) mineral water.<br>
--use of food supplements, currently green barley leaf extract ("Green<br>
Magma"),  at least once a day, taken during meal. Gives better general<br>
condition after a month or so, and (supposedly) helps with stomach ulcers.<br>
--various natural immune boosters, currently "cat's claw" (plant) extract.<br>
--various anti-oxidants, memory enhancers, garlic pills etc.<br>
--exercise on HealthRider TM, on "universal" fitness machine<br>
and pushups etc (*if* the energy and determination are present).<br>
--use of carnitine pills for increased ("natural") muscle growth<br>
(alledgedly also good for brain function). This works great, recommended<br>
(the rest too, btw).<br>
--going for walks or bike trips.<br>
--?<br>
<p>
Information:<br>
--learning to browse the web more efficiently (trough trial and error)<br>
--seeking out possibly enlightened groups.<br>
--trying to keep up to date with (technological) developments (I watch<br>
Discovery Channel a lot, visit talkboards, read popular-scientific mags<br>
etc.)<br>
<p>
Misc:<br>
--[having used] cannabis for recreational purposes and (both strong<br>
temporary, and mild permanent) sensory enhancement (all senses).<br>
I feel I can enjoy music, food, my whole environment etc. better since my<br>
"pot treatment" (one year of intense everyday use). If you didn't get high<br>
yet, you really should sometime soon. A good "trip" is [to me] the best<br>
experience one can get with this body and mind. You've never tasted such<br>
devine food, heard such angelic music (any music will do, but I prefer<br>
techno/trance), felt such universal happiness...<br>
HIGHLY recommended! Mushrooms can be great too, but are imo<br>
a bit less reliable, though never really unpleasant. I've had one really<br>
good trip with mushrooms (took them on 7 occasions or so).<br>
Non-smokers can use vaporizers or can eat the pot (after treatment).<br>
<p>
--having have made arrangements for cryonic suspension (just in case).<br>
<p>
[P.s: I am a lot less energetic than I may sound here]<br>
