<i>&gt; Do you have any kind of references to where I</i><br>
<i>&gt; could read more about these "many studies showing how this kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; environmental interaction transforms the state from a quantum</i><br>
<i>&gt; superposition to a classical mixture"?  Maybe even a source</i><br>
<i>&gt; approachable by someone as stupid about physics as I am?</i><br>
<p>
I don't have any non-technical references handy.  One on-line paper<br>
I saw recently was <a href="http://www.sns.ias.edu/~max/collapse.html">http://www.sns.ias.edu/~max/collapse.html</a>, which<br>
I believe discusses some related phenomena.  However it is very<br>
technical.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	So, then, is a quantum computer merely something that gets</i><br>
<i>&gt; quantum physical phenomenon to represent and logically operate on</i><br>
<i>&gt; information like a regular computer does with "classical" hardware?</i><br>
<i>&gt; If so, then why couldn't this "superposition" information simply be</i><br>
<i>&gt; represented by a sufficiently complex and appropriately programmed</i><br>
<i>&gt; "classical" machine?  Maybe it would be easier with "quantum"</i><br>
<i>&gt; machinery but why couldn't it be done with classical hardware?</i><br>
<p>
It depends on what you want to do.  If all you want is to do calculations,<br>
as with most of the recent interest in quantum computers, then you're<br>
right.  Any calculation doable on the quantum computer can be done on the<br>
classical computer.  The interest is that theoretically a quantum computer<br>
can do some calculations much faster than a classical computer.<br>
<p>
However, for the purposes of the thought experiment John Clark described,<br>
invented by David Deutsch (and predating the recent interest in quantum<br>
computers, although Deutsch pioneered the field in the 80s), we want to<br>
do something else.  We want to measure the state of a quantum system, and<br>
bring that measurement into the quantum computer, preserving its quantum<br>
nature.<br>
<p>
Consider a photon, or some other particle.  It enters a computer's sensor,<br>
and the computer will then work on the information obtained from that<br>
photon.<br>
<p>
In a classical computer, we will basically absorb the photon, and measure<br>
some of its state.  However, because of the Heisenberg uncertainty<br>
principle, we will inevitably measure only a part of the state.  Something<br>
is always lost.<br>
<p>
In a quantum computer, we must (somehow) accept the photon into the<br>
computer in such a way that the wholeness of the quantum state is<br>
preserved.  It may not stay in the particle, it may be transferred to<br>
some other particles, which represent and preserve the original state.<br>
Then, very carefully, we must operate on this representation, always<br>
protecting it from noise and preserving the coherence information.<br>
Finally, in Deutsch's example, we may eventually run some part of the<br>
calculation backwards and actually re-create the photon as it was when<br>
it entered the computer.<br>
<p>
This is very demanding.  Today we can bring a photon in and put it into<br>
a loop, with amplifiers, and preserve most of its state for some fleeting<br>
instants.  To actually do a lot of calculations on the photon (enough to<br>
simulate a conscious mind!) while preserving the phase and state information<br>
so perfectly will be quite a feat, to say the least!<br>
<p>
Hope this sheds some light for you -<br>
