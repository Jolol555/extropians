In other words, you're proposing to streamlink the legislature; let everyone<br>
vote on things directly.<br>
<p>
This is an obvious and known proposal; I had my reasons for not making it. <br>
Primarily I believe that the legislature *shouldn't* be fast or instantly<br>
responsive to the whims of the public.  Fast and responsive are for the<br>
purveyors of voluntarily purchased merchandise, not the counsel which wields<br>
force.  I reluctantly go along with the condescending conventional wisdom on<br>
this one subject:  Nations are too impulsive... and legislatures are less<br>
impulsive.  The one-month-cool-off period for vote investiture was intended to<br>
prevent similar impulsivity.<br>
<p>
The truth is that by concentrating the debate in individuals, you make it<br>
possible for people to pay attention, identify sides... a number of things<br>
that are impossible on a national scale.  On a national scale, you can have at<br>
most three or four sides.  A legislature makes it possible for there to be<br>
dozens of sides.  It's a threshold thing; any "legislator" receives attention,<br>
while a national movement needs a substantial percentage of the population<br>
before it attracts notice.  The legislature allows debates to be conducted in<br>
the open; the pros and cons to fight it out in an attentionable and recursible<br>
arena, rather than implicitly in the simplistic proposals that would be<br>
presented to voters by a controlled media.<br>
<p>
You can streamlink this sort of thing, but it requires a *very* highly<br>
evolved, pre-proven, trans-Firefly technology.  We don't have that right now,<br>
so it can't be incorporated into a Constitution being written right now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Re: state government, in the current system, this is one of the reasons</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the US gov. is still somewhat tolerable.  It traps people with</i><br>
<i>&gt; political ambitions at the lowest, least effective level, and presents</i><br>
<i>&gt; many layers of trap for them.  This is the primary function of</i><br>
<i>&gt; government, IMHO.  I asked a friend who had been a local San Diego</i><br>
<i>&gt; politician, and who had almost won a Ca. state office, about this, and he</i><br>
<i>&gt; agreed.  He said (paraphrasing) "It takes all of the effort you can muster</i><br>
<i>&gt; and then more, to play the game, at any level of government".</i><br>
<p>
I had the idea for a "House of Guardians" that would replace the current<br>
Congress.  They would be elected periodically, have great perks, a high<br>
salary, and be able to fire any bureaucrat whenever they felt like it.  They'd<br>
have no legislative or spending authority.  But they'd be the people you<br>
turned to for constituent service.  The perks, the personal power, and the<br>
poetic title would ensure that all the power-seekers ran for Guardian.<br>
<p>
The Guardians would have a variety of internal hierarchies to climb.  There<br>
might be Lesser Guardians on a local level.  And of course there'd be a<br>
single, High Guardian, with even better perks.  All of this is to trigger and<br>
ensnare the human instincts for seeking power.  Humans will reflexively<br>
attempt to climb any hierarchy, no matter how useless.<br>
<p>
People who wanted to accomplish something could become Legislators.  No perks,<br>
except for information-finding subordinates, free education, high-speed<br>
Internet access, and so on.  Small salary.  Not much media attention.  Your<br>
constituents always breathing down your neck to minimize their personal taxes.<br>
 But still wielding the guns.<br>
