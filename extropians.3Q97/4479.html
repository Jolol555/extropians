Both statements are true.<br>

<i>&gt;moral agreement.</i><br>
<p>
Apparently then, I misunderstood the statement, "and it is moral to defend<br>
against aggression." But let's wait and see what Ken has to say.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[kw]</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Now, define "aggression".</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[gl]</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;It is not the purpose of the primethic decision to define defense or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;aggression, but rather to identify the real world phenomenon that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;establishes the basis of both rights and morality. IOW, where do these</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;concepts come from?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;i think the more important question is; where do these concepts lead to.</i><br>
<i>&gt;when you talk about aggression as a 'real world phenomenon,' it sounds as</i><br>
<i>&gt;if you're  implying a  way in which aggression can be quantified and</i><br>
<i>&gt;measured,  and scientfic law be made; and it's not at all clear whether a</i><br>
<i>&gt;decision-maker has to surrender  his own judgement to that.  can a person</i><br>
<i>&gt;define a/d personally, or does thinking 'aggression is wrong' obligate </i><br>
<i>&gt;him to that of some 'real-world' philosophy of rights  and morality/</i><br>
<p>
The primethic decision is unilateral and voluntary. The person making that<br>
decision defines A/D. Only to the extent that *all* agree on definitions can<br>
A/D be quantified. Since the primethic implies consent, all else is by<br>
agreement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; If *you* want to say that rights are by agreement, then where does agreement</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; come from? Ultimately, there must be a real world connection, or the very</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; concept would not exist, and we wouldn't be having this discussion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's a matter of reality that people act toward each other in consensual</i><br>
<i>&gt;or non-consensual [aggressive or coercive] ways.  it's a matter of fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;that what makes the difference between a consensual or a non-consensual</i><br>
<i>&gt;interaction is agreement.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;agreement comes from choice, and choice is a fact of reality - humans are</i><br>
<i>&gt;moral agents, with their own wills and governing  their own  bodies,</i><br>
<i>&gt;acting on the basis of choice.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The concept of agreement, or more specifically, consent, is clearly implied</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; by the primethic decision. If defense is not moral, and aggression is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; immoral, then consent is meaningless. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;i don't think so.  i'm sure that consent was meaningful in human relations</i><br>
<i>&gt;long before a/d [which did not affect oneself] were considered other than</i><br>
<i>&gt;normal, amoral, human actions.</i><br>
<p>
In what way was consent meaningful?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;By deciding that defense is moral, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; aggression is immoral, we claim a right to consent for ourselves, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; unilaterally offer a reciprocol, and equal, right to all others.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;nor do i see how this follows.  people make decisions like this  every</i><br>
<i>&gt;day; but regarding certain people, in certain areas of their lives, only.</i><br>
<p>
Deciding that a particular act is right or wrong does not make a primethic<br>
decision. Deciding that aggression itself is immoral and defense itself is<br>
moral is what makes the primethic decision.<br>
<p>
When we view a dispute between others, do we judge those others to be right<br>
or wrong, or do we judge their actions (aggression/defense) to be right or<br>
wrong?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;the evidence of a widely-subscribed-to 'right to all others' is weaker,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and i think postulating it weakens your claim that the primethic is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;real-world decision.</i><br>
<p>
I am saying only that making the primethic decision *offers* a reciprocol<br>
right to all others. The primethic is real-world in that people do make that<br>
decision. And I think it is very widely subscribed to.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The all-important question is not whether the primethic exists, but whether</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; it is instinctively shared by all, or a decision is made along the way. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; fact that it *exists*, either way, lays the groundwork for rights, morality,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and subsequent agreements (consent).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;i have argued [and i think demonstrated] that, logically, a moral agent</i><br>
<i>&gt;must decide that [1] aggression against itself is wrong; or [2] its</i><br>
<i>&gt;defense against aggression is not wrong.  i have shown,  in a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;non-scientiic way, that the proposition holds empirically as well; only</i><br>
<i>&gt;pacifists deny [2], and of course deny they affirm [1]. that bit of</i><br>
<i>&gt;reasoning may even have helped inspire you to formulate the 'primethic'.  </i><br>
<p>
Indeed, this reasoning played an important part in formulating the primethic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;but that reasoning led me to a different point, in which each person makes</i><br>
<i>&gt;such a decision wrt herself. that's not the comprehensive rights agreement</i><br>
<i>&gt;that you sometimes seem to argue 'falls out' of the decision.   it is,</i><br>
<i>&gt;though, a schelling point [at least if i understand those fool things] -</i><br>
<i>&gt;an initial point of agreement from which  bargaining toward a true rights</i><br>
<i>&gt;framework can begin.  </i><br>
<p>
The primethic is just such a decision, and it is a Schelling point, but it<br>
is much more. Assuming that noncontroversial, intuitive, (instinctive?)<br>
basic definitions of defense and aggression can be determined, all basic,<br>
universally offered rights can be implied from it, with contractual<br>
agreements bargained from this as a Schelling point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;morality can be developed, by agreement, once such a schelling point is</i><br>
<i>&gt;established.  since the interests of all coincide on a/d [and therefore on</i><br>
<i>&gt;a universal rule that aggression is wrong and defense is right], then one</i><br>
<i>&gt;can expect each person to want such a rule to govern her.  that's not a</i><br>
<i>&gt;matter of morality, though, but [as you say] a matter of self-interest;</i><br>
<p>
Deciding that aggression *itself* is wrong and defense *itself* is right<br>
makes it a matter of morality. And yes, making the primethic decision is a<br>
matter of self interest.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Still, this could mean that defense is either moral or amoral. In</i><br>
non-human<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;context, we would probably deem defense to be *amoral*. In human context,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;however, it is in the interests of the vast majority to make a personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;moral choice to the effect that proportionate defense against</i><br>
aggression is<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*moral* and thus aggressive behavior which elicits a defensive</i><br>
response is<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*immoral*.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;arguments from self-interest do not establish the reality of any moral</i><br>
<i>&gt;rule.  they do, though, give reasons for one to act as if such</i><br>
<i>&gt;a rule were real, which of course gives it all the reality that a</i><br>
<i>&gt;moral rule needs.</i><br>
<p>
Huh? :-)<br>
