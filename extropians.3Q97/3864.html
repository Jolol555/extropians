     I don't see how Elizer can "target" cocaine supplies with his new <br>
     virus, without violating individual/property rights, even if he <br>
     develop it in his basement with his own funds. Unless he intends to <br>
     unleash it only in his own house.<br>

     Individuals can only decide what they individually want regarding what <br>
     they *think* and do in privacy or with another consenting person.  <br>
     Once you step out the door and into a community, you become part of it <br>
     and are, to a degree, subject to it.  <br>
     <br>
     Granted, the way we've clumsily designed democracy, set against our <br>
     do-or-die market economy, isn't ideal for the more robust of the <br>
     iconoclastic set.  <br>
     <br>
     As far as I'm concerned, cocaine debilitates my community, <br>
     reverberating through it with toxic effect and picking off the <br>
     contribution of individuals and disempowering those closest to them <br>
     who feel helpless to assist the addict.  SAME WITH TOBACCO.  SAME WITH <br>
     ALCOHOL.<br>
     <br>
     Individual property rights (as long as we're so intent on "owning" <br>
     stuff, particularly land!) do not outweight in importance a <br>
     substantiated threat to a community.  <br>
     <br>
     However, introducing viruses into crops from which addictive drugs are <br>
     made is not the ultimate solution.  BUT it is a way for the nanny to <br>
     wean the child from the pacifier.  And, unfortunately, many humans <br>
     fare little better than sheep as far as individual act or thought.  <br>
     The gene pool is a funny thing...<br>
