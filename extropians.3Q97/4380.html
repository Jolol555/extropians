A large brain may require a large body, but by what I've skimmed from<br>
Churchland a large body might well need a large brain to function.  <br>

I've often thought that for a given brain/body ratio flying birds and<br>
bats should be dumber than mammals.  X amount of brain is going to run<br>
the body, but for the flyers Y brain would be needed for flight control<br>
and modelling 3D rather than 2D reality, and thus less would be left<br>
over for being generally intelligent, whatever that means.  Has anyone<br>
ever studied this?<br>

Whales would have to be 3D, but they don't have to throw things.  Sonar<br>

Side note: 9 May _Science_ had a piece on estimated Neanderthal bulk and<br>
body size: yes they had brains as big or bigger than we do, but their<br>
bodies were even bigger, so their brain/body ratio was estimated to be<br>
10% less than that of Homo Sapiens.<br>
