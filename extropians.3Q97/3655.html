     I was quite inspired, being a stubborn, try-harder type most of my <br>
     life...'til quite recently.  I might've died (like the fly in Arjen's <br>
     parable) on the window sill.<br>

     I have come up with three interpretations of this so far.<br>
     Please elaborate.<br>

     That was me responding to Arjen's post.  I meant, metaphorically, that <br>
     for the bulk of my life, had relegated myself to a nominal existence <br>
     and was losing the will to live (but not to survive...wasn't suicidal, <br>
     just unmotivated).  Relentlessly, repeatitively bashing oneself <br>
     against an unseen barrier (the window pane) when, if a broader view <br>
     were taken, other options for freedom were there for the taking.  <br>
     That's where I am now!<br>
