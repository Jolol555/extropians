Don't have time to respond in detail, though I'm moved to.<br>
<p>
I have a Bad Feeling about this upcoming movie-ization...<br>
<p>
However, re the quote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    The Noblest fate that a man can endure is to place his own</i><br>
<i>&gt;    mortal body between his loved home and the war's desolation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The teacher explains that these are not his own words, (That</i><br>
<i>&gt; makes this a fourth-level of quoting) but that Juan would</i><br>
<i>&gt; of course recognize them. I don't. Do you?</i><br>
<p>
Well, "between his loved home and the war's desolation" is obvious...<br>
It's in The Star-Spangled Banner, second verse (what, you don't know all <br>
the verses? For shame! :) ):<br>
<p>
Oh thus be it ever <br>
that free men shall stand<br>
between their loved home <br>
and the war's des-o-la-tion<br>
...<br>
<p>
The rest of it might be cobbled from some other source.<br>
