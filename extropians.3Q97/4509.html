Long time list members might remember the discussion of IQ and the<br>
"Flynn effect". The Flynn effect refers to the widely observed<br>
increase in average scores on IQ-type tests during the past several<br>
decades (see abstract below.)<br>
<p>
The web adress:<br>
<a href="http://www.amsci.org/amsci/articles/97articles/Neisser.html">http://www.amsci.org/amsci/articles/97articles/Neisser.html</a> <br>
points to an article that briefly discusses several possible<br>
explanations for the Flynn effect.<br>
<p>
Rising Scores on Intelligence Tests<br>
Ulric Neisser<br>
American Scientist<br>
September-October 1997<br>
<p>
Abstract<br>
All over the world, average scores on intelligence tests have been<br>
rising for the better part of a century--essentially ever since such<br>
tests were invented. For example, average scores on standard<br>
broad-spectrum IQ tests are going up by about three points-relative to<br>
a mean of 100--every 10 years, and the increases are even higher on<br>
specialized measures of abstract-reasoning ability. The cause of these<br>
enormous gains remains unknown. No one knows if they reflect genuine<br>
increases in intelligence or just a gradual spread of some specialized<br>
knack for taking tests. Greater sophistication about tests surely<br>
plays some role in the rise, and other possible contributing factors<br>
include better nutrition, more schooling, altered child-rearing<br>
practices and the technology-driven changes of culture itself. Neisser<br>
explores these factors, and concludes that our highly visual<br>
environment may play a fundamental role in the increases in IQ scores.<br>
<p>
Here are two semi-provocative excerpts:<br>
<p>
These gains are far too rapid to result from genetic changes. There<br>
evidently are substantial environmental influences on g, even if we do<br>
not clearly understand them at the present time. Moreover, the sheer<br>
size of the gains undermines the very concept of general<br>
intelligence.<br>
...<br>
<p>
As Flynn puts it, the data imply that dozens of nations should now be<br>
in the midst of a cultural renaissance too great to be<br>
overlooked. Because that does not seem to be happening, Flynn<br>
concludes that the tests do not measure intelligence but only a minor<br>
sort of abstract problem-solving ability with little practical<br>
significance.<br>
...<br>
<p>
<p>
Author Neisser suggests the following (partial) explanation for the<br>
Flynn effect: "exposure to complex visual media has produced genuine<br>
increases in a significant form of intelligence."<br>
<p>
Begin Neisser excerpt:<br>
<p>
Perhaps the most striking 20th-century change in the human<br>
intellectual environment has come from the increase in exposure to<br>
many types of visual media. From pictures on the wall to movies to<br>
television to video games to computers, each successive generation has<br>
been exposed to far richer optical displays than the one<br>
before. People once regarded pictures as museum pieces or as<br>
occasional decorations for the homes of the rich; now they are<br>
everywhere, and everybody takes their own photographs. Schoolchildren<br>
of all ages devote far more time to visual projects today than they<br>
did a generation ago. (They devote correspondingly less time to the<br>
old three Rs of reading, writing and arithmetic, with the predictable<br>
consequence that skills in those domains have diminished.)<br>
<p>
Beyond merely looking at pictures, we analyze them. Picture puzzles,<br>
mazes, exploded views and complex montages appear everywhere--on<br>
cereal boxes, on McDonalds wrappers, in the instructions for<br>
assembling toys and in books intended to help children pass the<br>
time. Even the answer sheets for standardized tests--often on pages<br>
separate from the questions--assume that the test-takers can locate<br>
the right places to record their responses. And static displays such<br>
as pictures and diagrams are only the beginning. We have had movies<br>
since the 1920s, television since the 1950s and video games since the<br>
1970s. Patricia Greenfield of the University of California at Los<br>
Angeles argues that children exposed to these media develop specific<br>
skills of visual analysis, skills in which they routinely excel their<br>
elders. The assumption that children can program a VCR more<br>
effectively than their parents has become a cliche of American<br>
society, one that recognizes an important generational shift. <br>
