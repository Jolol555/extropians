Simple: It takes about thirty thousand genes, each hundreds of bases long,<br>
plus thousands of hours interacting with all the complexity of the real<br>
world, to produce human motivations.  This is simple?  It's immensely more<br>
complex than any AI program I've ever seen the inside of.<br>
<p>
Direct: It takes millions of neuron firings in a neural network at least<br>
dozens of levels deep to produce even the tiniest human action.<br>
<p>
They seem simple and direct because the conscious mind, whose purpose is to<br>
think about what the rest of the mind is doing, and tweak it, has a very<br>
simple and direct model.  It took modern science to reveal what an<br>
incredibly complicated mess the mind actually is.  Don't let your<br>
consciousness fool you into thinking motivations (or any other parts of<br>
yourself) are simple.  Introspection is profoundly deceptive.  <br>
<p>
As for intrinsic, natural and robust, I'll agree with you there.  Evolution<br>
is a more robust designer than humans are, because it's made so many more<br>
mistakes.  And of course the results are natural and intrinsic.<br>
