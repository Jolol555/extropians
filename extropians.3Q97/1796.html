I don't trust them either, certainly not with *my life*, if that's what you<br>
mean...<br>
         <br>
<i>&gt;       Does a person intending to be cryonically preserved wear a </i><br>
<i>&gt;      special identification indicating alternative action?  </i><br>
<p>
Yes, usually they do (bracelet, pendant wallet card), although I suppose it<br>
could easily be overlooked or misinterpreted in the confusion of a (big)<br>
accident. Also, there is a very real possibility that people (including<br>
medical personnel) won't respect your choice, and refuse to perform the<br>
procedures.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      Considering the </i><br>
<i>&gt;      pervasive attitude of the acceptance of physical death, do healthy </i><br>
<i>&gt;      extropians involved in fatal accidents have any assurance their</i><br>
bodies <br>
<i>&gt;      will be expediently managed to the right fridge (cryonics crypt and </i><br>
<i>&gt;      not the morgue)?</i><br>
<i>&gt;      </i><br>
<p>
Right now, imo only the ones in the US, and specifically in the LA region,<br>
have <br>
a remotely reasonable chance of  being "rescued" in time (and of course<br>
[all] those who happen to live in the vicinity of a suspension site). So<br>
your scepticism is completely justified, but...*we* can make a difference!<br>
[mellow music, please!]<br>
<p>
Something that could help:<br>
  <br>
The the development of a (there you have it!) *deathwatch*. You know, the<br>
device that's been discussed here before (or was it on CryoNet?) with<br>
GSM/GPS, ultra-sensitive microphone pulse measuring, (burst) warning<br>
signal, a buzzer, a heartbeat recognition chip, maybe even voice activation<br>
and communication possibilties, water tight, shock proof etc etc. This<br>
little gem could *really* make a difference, because it would watch over<br>
you night and day, 7 days a week, etc. No more "sneakin' a death" (dieing<br>
in bed is in fact one of the greatest risks for a cryonicist. It could be<br>
hours, maybe even days before someone finds you. Your poor brain must be<br>
mush by then, especially in the winter (!) <br>
<p>
The GSM phones are getting smaller every day, at this rate they will be<br>
small enough to fit neatly on your wrist by next year or so (dynamic<br>
optimism in full effect!) If not, you could still do it yourself using some<br>
of the phone components<br>
and some other stuff, like microphones and a pulse recognition chip.<br>
<p>
Some other possibly useful features of the "watch":<br>
--autolink to your friends/family (if they live closeby and wear "watches"<br>
too) for<br>
quick "first aid".<br>
--autolink to your suspension provider and cooperative medical personnel<br>
etc.<br>
--auto-detection of other wearers (for example extropians) in a 50 meter<br>
radius<br>
or so, with discreet signalling (vibrating!) and ID exchange, if so<br>
desired.<br>
--it can actually be used as a watch (!), and not even the ugliest one if<br>
you put<br>
some effort into the design ;)<br>
--lots and lots of other things I can't think of right now...<br>
<p>
Also it would be very useful to advertise more, especially in big<br>
"accomplished"<br>
magazines and on television. More members = also better chances of timely<br>
(quality) suspension and revival for *you* (for obvious reasons).<br>
<p>
Overall more money is needed, lots of it; for the ads, for Prometheus, for<br>
the<br>
watch, for more and better ambulances etc. etc.<br>
<p>
So...why not use the awesome extropian potential to achieve these goals<br>
(all these technicians, scientists, bussines people and Jahweh knows<br>
what...it<br>
should be a *breeze*!) some of which could return your investment tenfold<br>
or more, if marketed properly (the watch could easily be modified for lots<br>
of uses, like hiker resque for ex.)<br>
<p>
Getting rich, safe *and* better preserved...what more could you possibly<br>
want<br>
(ok, a lot).<br>
<p>
