First, the bet is wrong, it should be head up (not down) he loses 1/a2<br>
dollars, else he wins 1/(1-a2). This way the subject has zero expected<br>
profit. Suppose the subject accepts the bet, and remember that if the coin<br>
landed head up, there would be two subjects who answer question 2.  Then<br>
if the coin landed head up, the experimenter wins 2/a2 dollars, otherwise<br>
he loses 1/(1-a2) dollars.  a2 should be 2/3 if the experimenter is to<br>
have zero expected profit. <br>

<p>
No, I think the only way to avoid being taken advantage of is to answer<br>
with answer set B. If the subject(s) answer 1/2 to question 2 the<br>
experimenter will have a positive expected profit on what the subject(s)<br>
think is a fair bet.<br>
