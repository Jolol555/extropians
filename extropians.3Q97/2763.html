&lt;&lt; <br>
 The Aug issue of Scientific American has a profile of Jeremy Rifkin,<br>
 biological fundamentalist number one.  Here's an eloquent description of<br>
 how many of us here view the world by Mr Rifkin from that article.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Scientific American is lending credibility to JeremyRifkin?<br>
<p>
I'm no scientist...although I hold scientist in high esteem...I'm<br>
mathematically challenged...anything I can't visuallize I have difficulty<br>
with....but I was a mediorcre electronics tech for a decade or so...<br>
<p>
I say that to underline my viewpoint....I love hard science fiction...and for<br>
years I regularly read Popular Science, Scientific American and several other<br>
of that ilk.<br>
<p>
A few years ago I discontinued PS and SA...I become uneasy with them...I felt<br>
that they had an agenda...that they were not so much interested in Science as<br>
"THE TRUTH"...  <br>
<p>
It seems I was right.<br>
<p>
<p>
I have no problem with any publication doing whatever it wants...I'm a huge<br>
adherent to the principles of the Free Market...But I think there should be<br>
some honesty and integrety...The writing that I have read of Rifkin are<br>
Luddite...or so my impression...for SA to lend credibillity to him decreases<br>
their own  already lessened credibility  in my view.<br>
<p>
But what do I know....I'm just  a Truck Driver.<br>
