Whichever group first develops nanotech might be able to take certain<br>
pre-emptive actions before *announcing* (not releasing) nanotechnology to the<br>
population at large.  I recommend that:<br>
<p>
1)  Most nuclear weapons be disabled, leaving a reserve for goo outbreaks.<br>
<p>
2)  Auto-healing nano be surreptitiously infiltrated into all human biological<br>
organisms.  These should heal most large-scale wounds, cure all diseases, and<br>
reverse all aging over a certain level.<br>
<p>
Certain utilities should also be made available immediately after public<br>
announcement.  These utilities might be activated by a pattern of muscle<br>
tensions, hands making a particular sign, jaws clicked together, eyes blinked,<br>
a "spell" recited, and so on.  (Magic:  It's baaaack!)  They should also be<br>
capable of being "preset" to be invoked by various bodily traumas and so on.<br>
<p>
Since the announcement and help systems should be universal, they should be<br>
announced by nano-speakers suddenly coalescing on every street corner.<br>
<p>
1)  A "Diamond Cocoon" utility should be disseminated.  When invoked, the<br>
person should be encased in an impermeable Cocoon, immune to attack, fire,<br>
earthquake, or goo.  The Cocoon might be capable of placing the person in<br>
suspended animation or some other unaware state of dynamic balance with the<br>
Cocoon system.<br>
  The Cocoon could be used by citizens to defend themselves from their<br>
government, or by starving persons.  It could also be used by the Nano Rulers.<br>
 China attacks?  Okay, everyone in China gets put on "hold" for a couple of<br>
days while we get our forces into position, blow up their tanks, dissolve<br>
their weapons...<br>
<p>
2)  Utilities for cosmetic body modification and aging reversal should be<br>
available.  This should DEFINITELY include green skin color and neutral facial<br>
features.  Nano-liposuction is a plus; nano-musculature should be limited.<br>
<p>
3)  NanoNet.  Some kind of computer that coalesces when you want it.<br>
<p>
4)  (Debatable:)  Universal Nano Serial Numbers.  Universal Digital<br>
Signatures.  With all that body modification, maybe we should have some way of<br>
keeping track of each other.<br>
<p>
5)  Private Property. Some area belongs to you; then no other objects are<br>
allowed inside without your approval.  Likewise for objects tagged as being<br>
owned by you; you can order them Cocooned.  The problem is figuring out what<br>
belongs to who.<br>
<p>
6)  Travel Utils.  You pick a destination, and then get wrapped up in a Cocoon<br>
and delivered.  You can also use this on objects you own.  A sub-util will be<br>
BringMe, as in "BringMe 'Wallet'".<br>
<p>
7)  Copy and Paste.  Although I don't think this will be possible.<br>
<p>
8)  Anesthesia.  Persons should be capable of disabling their pain center.<br>
<p>
----<br>
<p>
Questions:<br>
<p>
What degree of control should parents have over their children?  Who<br>
determines who the parents are?  Can older children sever the control?<br>
<p>
What did I leave out?<br>
<p>
Which of these could be easily acheived, given a major government?  Given a<br>
major company?  A small company?<br>
