<i>     &gt;Don't jump to conclusions, this is only the circumspection phase of </i><br>
<i>     &gt;the</i><br>
<i>     &gt;debate. Tell me what you think after you "See What You Think..." Feel</i><br>
<i>     &gt;free to send me an updated list of your elements and the related grid</i><br>
<i>     &gt;values.</i><br>
     <br>
     Hilarious.<br>
     <br>
     If this is what the orchestra sounds like tuning up I don't wanna be <br>
     here for the recital.<br>
     <br>
     Never in my life have I seen such an open display of California Uber <br>
     Alles Think. Not since the development of "rainbow" meditation has <br>
     humanity been blessed with such vital cultural appropriation. Does the <br>
     phrase "Selling ice to the Eskimoes" ring any bells with you? The <br>
     western world is swimming in californian self improvement programs and <br>
     my advice is go straight to the original tibetan.<br>
     <br>
     Am I to take it that you intend to display and advertise  a <br>
     consciously planned program for achieving free thought?  And that you <br>
     will only accept criticism of said "mindset" if presented in neato <br>
     "mindset" form? <br>
     <br>
     Congratulations. Another pinnacle of anal retentiveness conquered.<br>
     <br>
     eskimoes...ice...eskimoes...know what I mean?<br>
     <br>
     If there is anything substantial to this orchestral nightmare please <br>
     get on with it because so far it sounds awful. If this is a debate <br>
     then please articulate your argument. If it is not then just go set up <br>
     a commune somewhere or shove an element up a grid value or something, <br>
     but somewhere else.<br>
     <br>
     True obscenity lies in the need to convert.<br>
     <br>
