<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I said a thousand times, I don't know nothing of economics</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; or english grammar ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why do you say that? Most people I met in the Internet say I have an</i><br>
<i>&gt; excellent English. Even when I go abroad and have to speak English,</i><br>
<i>&gt; no-one has ever said I had a bad knowledge of the English language,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you're the first and I would like to know why.</i><br>
<p>
I apoligize sincerely, it was a very mean thing for me to point out.  In<br>
general, your grammar is very good-- probably better than mine; however,<br>
my little remark was in reference to your statement "I don't know nothing<br>
of economics."  When you say "don't know nothing," that is a<br>
double-negative.  It's almost as big a mistake as when I finish half my<br>
sentences with a preposition.  Ah, we're Science students, we don't know<br>
nothing about grammar, do we?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I love it, I teach anyone who asks me to, within the limits of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; knowledge, even that I have to give the same answer 10, 20, 100, 500</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; times.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What if you are asked this question so many times, it begins to detract</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; from your aging research?  Then, would you be so altruistic?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is just not being altruistic.</i><br>
<p>
I agree, there may be some selfish advantages in having lots of other<br>
people play guitar.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A better example is my aging research,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the more people I can teach about aging, the more people will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; interested and start researching and the more people would try to solve</i><br>
<i>&gt; the aging problem. </i><br>
<p>
And so you must weigh the advantages of spending your time teaching others<br>
and spending your time actually doing research.  When you spend too much<br>
time teaching others, you have to cut back so you can do more research.<br>
This is all anyone on the list is saying: too much time is being spent on<br>
answering basic questions(as opposed to more complicated and unanswered<br>
question), so people asking these questions are being discouraged in<br>
favour of going and reading a book.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The more people try to solve the aging problem, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; quicker will it be solve, the better for all of us, including myself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Answering your question, if someone woke me up to ask me how to play a B</i><br>
<i>&gt; chord, I would be upset because that persons disturbed my sleep.</i><br>
<p>
As some people on this list are disturbed by the massive amount of mail in<br>
their box every day from people asking the same basics questions, over and<br>
over.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of being a small group of which no-one (at least in Portugal)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; has ever heard of, and taking 20, 50, 100 or 500 years to develop</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; nanotech and life extension, if others would support "our" (this is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; "our" between commas because I don't agree with all your principles)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; cause this objectives would much soon be achieved.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; True, but this should be achieved without coercion.  I take responsibility</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for my own education- I don't expect others to be there to answer my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; questions when the answers are at my local library.  Once I have this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; information, I can make an informed debate, and decide for myself the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; validity of this information.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That is why most persons never heard of extropianism. Do you think that</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a good thing?</i><br>
<i>&gt; All I'm trying to say is that I disagree with this kind of attitudes and</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think that trying to convert persons to "our" cause is a good thing</i><br>
<i>&gt; that should be pursued. It takes work, of course, but it is, IMHO, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; right decision. The rules of the list are clear, the list doesn't exist</i><br>
<i>&gt; to make converts, I respect that although I disagree.</i><br>
<p>
There is a very simple solution to your disagreement: start a new list.<br>
The list's purpose would be to debate the fundamentals of extropianism.<br>
No question is too basic, newbies welcome and encouraged.  There is<br>
already a usenet newsgroup called "alt.extropians" that isn't being used,<br>
all you need to do is get people there.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If I told you "the A chord isn't actually an A, it's a B flat", you would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; say I'm wrong.  What if I replied: "I don't believe you, but I don't want</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to read any books on subject... maybe I will eventually get around to it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In the mean time, I don't believe you.  It's obvious that the A chord is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; actually B flat, I don't understand how you can even begin to think it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not."  Wouldn't that make you a little frustrated? (come on, be honest ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes but if you ask 100 guitar player what is an A chord, they will ALL</i><br>
<i>&gt; give you the same answer. However, if you ask 100 economists if</i><br>
<i>&gt; free-markets are the best solutions, they won't give you the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; answer.</i><br>
<p>
I have yet to have an economics professor or teaching assistant who<br>
doesn't think a free-market is the best solution.  If you admit you<br>
haven't read any books on economics, how can you make this statement?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Free-markets is not (at least for many people) the best</i><br>
<i>&gt; solution, it's not the ultimate truth.</i><br>
<p>
No, but what is?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; An A chord is always an A chord</i><br>
<i>&gt; and if anyone disagrees on that he is immediately wrong,</i><br>
<p>
I think you should go to your local library or even the internet, and<br>
search for the word "epistemology" before you make a statement like that.<br>
What makes you so sure?   Why is he "immediately wrong"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; if someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; disagrees with free-markets he is not necessarily wrong. </i><br>
<p>
I won't argue with that.  I don't think anyone here is "sure" that<br>
free-markets are best solution; however, most people on the list have yet<br>
to encounter a better system, so they are "pretty sure"  When you<br>
criticise free-markets, people are not saying "you are wrong to criticise<br>
free-markets"  What people are saying is that they have heard your same<br>
questions before, many times, and the answers are all addressed in books<br>
which are mentioned in the introductory message to this list.<br>
If more people read these books, there would be a more informed discussion<br>
on this list, and theoretically more could be accomplished.  I think the<br>
more established list members are tired of newbies throwing out statements<br>
without a shred of evidence, then telling everyone that they have<br>
"closed-minds" when the newbie get's his argument torn to pieces.  I<br>
haven't been here long enough to be annoyed when someone brings up a basic<br>
question, but I can understand why some members are.  As I mentioned<br>
before, start a new list instead of trying to alter the purpose of this<br>
one.<br>
