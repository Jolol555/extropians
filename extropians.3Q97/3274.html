     Marvin Minsky and Eric Drexler both finally signed up, and that makes <br>
     me feel better.  But I'm sure each of you can think of countless <br>
     intellectual influences whose cryonics membership status is <br>
     non-existent or unknown.  What can we do about it, if anything?<br>
     <br>

     I'm curious whether, in either gentleman's case, they were sponsored <br>
     for preservation.  They are very highly regarded and popular amongst <br>
     Extropians/Cryonics enthusiasts.  Frankly, if someone said to me, <br>
     "You're an incredibly worthwhile human so I'm going to see to it that <br>
     instead of being buried or cremated, you'll be in suspended <br>
     animation.",  I'd kindly accept the gift...with the stipulation that I <br>
     only be "reactivated" in the event that the world has become a place I <br>
     genuinely want to live an extra-long time in.  If it still has <br>
     disregard for other humans, this blind market economy (one step up <br>
     above ape-like survivalism IMO), and a wanton consumerist mentality, <br>
     I'd just as soon not reanimate.<br>
     <br>
     It is my feeling that the expectations of a superior future world and <br>
     the expectations of a beyond death existence have similar fleeting <br>
     notions of hope and faith attached to them.  In the cryonics scenario, <br>
     you're relying on the benevolence and capability of your fellow humans <br>
     to follow through with that which serves your best interests.  There <br>
     are only a few humans on the planet I know of who I could honestly and <br>
     completely count on and even at that, "outta sight, outta mind."<br>
     <br>
     Faith is faith, my fellow truth seekers.  Atheist or fundamentalist, <br>
     it's all about how good a spin you can put on it to convince your own <br>
     self-constructed perception of how it all works.<br>
     <br>
     It was asked what motivates people to give advice about life when they <br>
     are ready (and perhaps willing?) to relinquish theirs to old age or <br>
     disease.  I'm somehow reminded of the resistence I had to all the <br>
     bible-thumping fundamentalists I grew up with.  Ideally, they were <br>
     followers of the "Prince of Peace" but they were often anything BUT <br>
     peaceful.  I knew very early on that if there WAS a heaven that lasted <br>
     for all eternity, I'd be *damned* if I was going to spend it with <br>
     those people.  Immortality is a big deal and if I get it, I want it <br>
     with my preferred view.  Otherwise, I'm content to sit back and see <br>
     what's behind the inter-dimension door.  Advice in the 11th hour is a <br>
     reassessment of what you accomplished and hopefully you did what you <br>
     came for (whoop, whoop, metaphysic alert).<br>
     <br>
     Even if there's nothing after life, nothing isn't anything to worry <br>
     about if awareness isn't there to perceive it.  Once a forever burning <br>
     hell was eliminated from my thinking as a subsequent existence to life <br>
     on planet Earth, everything else seems like cake.<br>
     <br>
