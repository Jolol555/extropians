<i>&gt; &gt; I've never worked on a biplane, but I do know that business jets take a</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; a turbine engine is a lot tougher than a piston engine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Aha... this may explain our difference of opinion. You're talking purely</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the amount of time required for maintenance when it's neccesary,</i><br>
<i>&gt; whereas I'm talking about the frequency of maintenance and the frequency</i><br>
<i>&gt; of failures.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sure, major maintenance on a more complex plane is going to be more</i><br>
<i>&gt; complex and time-consuming, but from what I remember Bach's books he'd get</i><br>
<i>&gt; up in the morning for an hour or two of maintenance on his biplane and</i><br>
<i>&gt; even then every few weeks the engine would fail for some reason and he'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to make an emergency landing. In comparison, he'd jump into his jet</i><br>
<i>&gt; (T-38?) to fly between Florida and California with only a cursory</i><br>
<i>&gt; preflight check; and it never crashed. In both cases they had major</i><br>
<i>&gt; maintenance every once in a while, which would be much more work for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; jet than the biplane.</i><br>
<p>
This is an important point to include: Bach's biplane had no phased<br>
service program established by the manufacturer, while the business jet<br>
most certainly had a very extensive one, which went a long way toward<br>
preventing most breakdowns due to wear/use. If Bach had a similar<br>
program for the biplane, I would expect that he could expect a similar<br>
reliability, if not better. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So complexity may increase the effort required to maintain an aircraft,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but has little bearing on reliability. And since much of that maintenance</i><br>
<i>&gt; involves taking things off, looking at them, and putting them back on,</i><br>
<i>&gt; built-in nanosensors could eliminate most of that.</i><br>
<p>
It also includes replacing parts at timed intervals on a rigorous basis.<br>
Changing fluids, greasing joints, replacing gaskets, o-rings, filters,<br>
etc. testing circuits, replacing bulbs, switches and sensors as they<br>
wear out. Monitoring insulation resistance, ground connections, etc.<br>
Large components need to be replaced and rebuilt at timed intervals,<br>
like generators, drive systems, pumps, motors, etc..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You can sheild a large part of it, but you are going to preserve the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; areas of greatest sheilding for your crew, and with a mid course</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; turnaround, you've gotta have two sheilds, unless you can unhitch from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it and turn around and rehitch to the sheild at midcourse.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You missed the point; the shield is just supposed to be a big hunk of junk</i><br>
<i>&gt; which flies along in front of your ship and erodes when hit. But you're</i><br>
<i>&gt; right; you would have problems holding it in place while braking.  I guess</i><br>
<i>&gt; you'd just rely on the exhaust from your engines vaporising anything small</i><br>
<i>&gt; before it hit you; if you hit anything big you're dead anyway, shield or</i><br>
<i>&gt; no shield.</i><br>
<p>
If you are using  a conventional reaction drive, you can expect the<br>
exhaust to privide a bit of a shockwave, and you can just let the sheild<br>
coast on ahead of you at high speed, so long as you are going to remain<br>
on the same course. Otherwise, you'll have to have some near bussard<br>
level magnetic systems to develop an EM shockwave in front.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Once they brought it back due to a broken toilet.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Can you cite a mission number, because I don't remember that. I have vague</i><br>
<i>&gt; memories of coming back early because of a blocked water dump valve, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; that was a problem because the fuel cells need to dump water overboard,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not because it affected the toilet.</i><br>
<p>
That may have been it. I remember the pundits making jokes about the<br>
mission being scrubbed because someone plugged the toilet.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The point is that things break more often than not with the shuttle,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; even though it was custom built and is basically rebuilt after every</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mission, and it only flies one week missions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sure, but that's due to government designs, not an inherent problem with</i><br>
<i>&gt; spacecraft (BTW, wasn't the last shuttle flight over two weeks?). And it</i><br>
<i>&gt; still doesn't affect the fact that the majority of maintenance is fixed</i><br>
<i>&gt; regardless of flight time. If a fuel cell breaks or a valve blocks up you</i><br>
<i>&gt; just tear it out and fit a new one; that may require a few hours of</i><br>
<i>&gt; overtime, but it's nothing compared to overhauling the engines.</i><br>
<p>
Sure, I'll just do a couple 36 hour long spacewalks and change that fuel<br>
cell in space, without a ground crew or equipment to support me. A multi<br>
year voyage needs to carry its own entire maintenance departments with<br>
it, with a stockpile of spare parts and consumables. Oh and I'll need a<br>
collapsible space dock to help contain the mess while everything is<br>
apart.<br>
<p>
Here's an excercise to get some minimal idea of what I am talking about:<br>
if you have a motorboat, take it, sufficient supplies, and tools and<br>
parts out onto a body of water. Then proceed to dissasemble the engine<br>
and totally rebuild it without returning to land and before your<br>
supplies and patience runs out.<br>
<p>
THink you can do it before getting washed onto rocks or swamped in<br>
stormy seas? Wanna bet your life?<br>
