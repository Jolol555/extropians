Damien gives some sound advice for someone wanting to begin to write <br>
sf (such an intimidating genre for even the best writer!), but I <br>
would like to suggest that merely reading good authors will not make <br>
someone into a writer.<br>
<p>
When I look back on How I Learned to Write, it isn't books that I've <br>
read that stick in the memory--it's the authors and editors who <br>
worked with me to sharpen my skills and develop my own unique style.<br>
It used to be that young authors could obtain this sort of feedback <br>
by submitting their work, but nowadays editors have to spend most of <br>
their time digging out from under piles of really awful submissions, <br>
and works get rejected with no comment whatsoever.<br>
<p>
Wherever one lives, there must be an art school, a community center, <br>
or local writer's groups--places to find mentors and teachers to <br>
help you gain a strong base of skills that you can use in any genre.<br>
Yes, it means suffering through seemingly stupid writing exercises, <br>
but it can also mean the opportunity to spend time with successful <br>
novelists, poets laureate, and maybe even a sf writer who would be <br>
willing to provide the sometimes harsh guidance needed to mold a <br>
truly great writer.<br>
<p>
I wish you success,<br>
<p>
Kathryn<br>
