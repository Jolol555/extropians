Yes, and she is largely a deathist. On top of that, more recent studies<br>
have shown that in real life people go through her phases in different<br>
orders, and may even jump over some. <br>
<p>
On a more ad hominem level (sorry), she has recently become convinced <br>
about reincarnation (yes, she was apparently an Egyptian priestess; <br>
how come so few remember their lives as indian farmers?) which suggests <br>
that she is herself trying to come on terms with death. I suggest some <br>
critical reading of her works (which after all *are* AFAIK one of the <br>
major studies on terminal psychology).<br>
