It seems to me that there are two issues here and I've only seen one<br>
discussed: the hazard associated with a failure.  I've already posted my<br>
view that the Plutonium hazard is virtually non-existant and that the most<br>
dangerous thing about the probe would be its kinetic energy. Despite the<br>
fact -- and I consider it incontrovertible -- that the opposition to<br>
Cassini is driven by junk science and hysteria, the opponents do have one<br>
compelling argument on their side:  they are being made to pay for this<br>
mission against their will.<br>
<p>
I accept as a given that if Cassini provides any data at all, it will<br>
benefit the human race.  However, although governments are good at quick<br>
and dirty projects and sometimes fund useful science, for the most part<br>
politics governs decisions.  Science, by its nature, must be free and open<br>
but even the most benign government bureaucracies tend toward their<br>
opposite.  "Big" science as practiced by government bureaucracies is<br>
wasteful and inflexible.  It is true that planetary exploration is<br>
CURRENTLY expensive and it APPEARS that only a government can fund it.<br>
But, if there is ever going to be an expansion of humanity beyond the<br>
Earth, we will have to get the government out of the picture -- market<br>
forces will yield solutions that will reduce costs and open up<br>
possibilities for exploration and exploitation that will dwarf anything<br>
that government bureaucracies are likely to produce.<br>
<p>
So, the Cassini opponents, in their neo-Luddite way, actually have an<br>
important point to make and it behooves us to give it due consideration.<br>
I think the issue should be how government can effectively privatize space<br>
-- in other words, how quickly government can get out of the picture.<br>
