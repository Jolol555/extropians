<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The laser bombs carried by the FB were</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; slow and impede a Soviet advance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Have you read the latest reports on the success rate of laser-guided bombs</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; in the Gulf? Doesn't make good reading. Wish I hadn't mislaid the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; newspaper article I cut out or I'd give you figures.</i><br>
<p>
You'll also notice that I mentioned the bit about surveyed sites. With<br>
exact coordinates, which were not possible before the age of GPS, a<br>
laser bomb could home in on a precise point with inertial guidance and a<br>
touch of help from the launch plane. Without such exact data, its<br>
accuracy is much as reported.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;People say that 25% accuracy is a crappy result. BS. Considering that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;infantry shoots an average of 9000 rounds to kill one enemy soldier,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;artillery tosses an average of 50 rounds to nail one tank, etc....a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;25-50% success rate is highly surgical by military standards.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Most people's conception of what military accuracy is or should be is often</i><br>
<i>&gt; seriously out of sorts with reality and economy.  The old Copperhead</i><br>
<i>&gt; "smart" artillery rounds were about 20% accurate at hitting tanks at</i><br>
<i>&gt; $25,000 a piece.  An equivalent "dumb" round costs ~$500 and on average</i><br>
<i>&gt; requires 500 rounds expended per tank kill (most heavy armor today requires</i><br>
<i>&gt; a direct artillery hit for a kill).  The $500 dumb rounds may sound cheap,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but when multiplied by the number required for the same effect, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; usually cost more.  In a battlefield environment it is absolutely amazing</i><br>
<i>&gt; if you have 50% accuracy.</i><br>
<p>
Probably the dumbest decision made in the last decade was to retire the<br>
A-10. The A-10's GAU-9 30mm cannon, which shot steel jacketed rounds<br>
with spent uranium cores, were probably the most economical way to kill<br>
tanks devised. With a couple hundred rounds in a burst, such a weapon is<br>
even usefull against the new "compound" armor which uses exterior<br>
explosive plates. Much more cost effective than the Maverick missile.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But a more important factor is speed.  An artillery battery using "dumb"</i><br>
<i>&gt; rounds requires approximately 30 minutes to fire 500 rounds.  5 "smart"</i><br>
<i>&gt; rounds can be fired in less than a minute.  Since most battles are over in</i><br>
<i>&gt; less than 30 minutes, it is well worth the extra money for the quick</i><br>
<i>&gt; lethality of "smart" weapons.  This is especially true when you are going</i><br>
<i>&gt; head-to-head against similar equipment.</i><br>
<p>
THis is why the infantry platoon's M-60 gunner typically has an<br>
estimated life expectancy in a firefight of around 60 seconds. Since the<br>
M-60 puts out the most lead in the least time of all weapons in the<br>
platoon, the enemy's first goal is to take out the M-60 gunner.<br>
<p>
Smart munitions designed for use in high threat environments, like the<br>
theoretical soviet invasion of western europe, are especially valuable<br>
compared to smart bombs, as such an environment gives the average ground<br>
attack plane a life expectancy of less than ten missions. They are also<br>
good for single run attacks, which allows a greater level of surprise<br>
than attacks which require multiple runs to take out a target. THis is<br>
why attacks like Tripoli and the Isreali run on Bagdads nuke plant in<br>
84(?) were so successfull.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The 9000 small-arms rounds per kill sounds a little high, but if true</i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't surprise me.  Rounds are usually expended for purposes *other*</i><br>
<i>&gt; than killing people.  For example, suppressive fire isn't intended to kill</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone but uses up a lot of ammo.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
This was one of the amazing factoids that MacNamara's bean counters came<br>
up with during Vietnam.<br>
