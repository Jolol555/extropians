Assuming that c is the limit speed for data transfer, galaxy brains have<br>
an obvious problem - it takes some 100K years for a message to get to<br>
all parts of a galaxy. The darn things are just too big and too diffuse!<br>
<p>
One answer to all this is to make the galaxy more dense.... after all, a<br>
galaxy is mostly space, and I expect computational nanotechnology to<br>
have a density comparable to water.... So I began to think of<br>
mega-ringworlds and beyond dyson spheres. <br>
<p>
The area of a black hole's event horizon is proportional to its mass.<br>
The more massive a balck hole, the less dense it is, and the smaller the<br>
gravitational field at the event horizon. Imagine building something<br>
like a dyson sphere whose radius is just slightly larger than the event<br>
horizon of a black hole of the same mass.... The kind of technology<br>
capable of a galaxy brain should be able to move all the matter in the<br>
galaxy essentially at will. <br>
<p>
We can eliminate stars as energy production devices, as ALL the matter<br>
in a galaxy is to used for this endeavour. It is much more efficient to<br>
drop a little matter into a black hole, getting 1/2 mc^2 back - rather<br>
than the 0.1% yield for fusion....<br>
<p>
Since the super dyson sphere is not tasked to collect stellar radiation,<br>
there is a way to construct one without encountering severe stresses.<br>
Start with an object in orbit. Make the orbit slightly elliptical. Now<br>
imagine a "string of beads" in orbit, like an elliptical necklace. Now<br>
imagine lots and lots of beads, say 1cm beads with 1mm spacing. The<br>
inter bead spacing varies slightly as the beads orbit due to the<br>
ellipticity. Since the ellipse is very nearly circular, this variation<br>
would be in microns. Control of such a system could be via magnetics or<br>
electrostatics between the beads.<br>
<p>
Imagine a second beady ellipse, 180 degrees in orientation. To avoid<br>
collisions, make the two orbital planes at a very slight angle to one<br>
another. This pair of intertwined necklaces is now repeated until one<br>
sees a sphere, which becomes two interlaced ellipsoids, very nearly<br>
spherical. We now have a very nearly spherical structure with no<br>
internal stresses. Just add mass until one uses up the galaxy....<br>
<p>
The gravity experts will have to answer the next speculation - since the<br>
gravity field within a spherical shell is flat, it may be possible to<br>
have an event horizon for the entire structure slightly below the<br>
orbits, and still maintain a black hole in the very center - provided<br>
gratis by most galaxies anyway....<br>
<p>
I don't know the numbers here, I guess that such an object will be a few<br>
tens of light years across - but about 10^4 times faster signaling.....<br>
