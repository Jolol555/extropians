Robin, I can't help think your analysis is wrong to omit some analysis of<br>
communication and interaction in its discussion of belief (and, indeed, of<br>
clothes.) Without the communication of your belief to another through some<br>
form of interaction, vocal or otherwise, it does not serve a social<br>
purpose. Moreover, since this interaction is a choice, it is a<br>
manifestation of the functionality of the belief system, within your model.<br>
The dichotomy between functional and social roles of belief is therefore<br>
blurred: one function of belief is social differentiation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;For example, a belief that the local sports team will do well can help me</i><br>
<i>&gt;associate with my locality... &lt;snip&gt;...A belief that UFOs are aliens could</i><br>
<i>&gt;help me signal that I'm an independent thinker...</i><br>
<p>
Both these are good examples of my point, the second particularly: the<br>
belief could help you _signal_ that you're an independent thinker. But it<br>
is the signal which acts to fulfil a social role, and that signal is part<br>
of the function of the belief.<br>
<p>
Your definition of 'function' seems reflexive: a function is something<br>
which acts on the 'wearer' of clothes or belief, whereas a social role is<br>
something which involves the 'wearer' and at least one other. But I think<br>
that the interaction of 'wearer' and other, necessary for a social role, is<br>
as much a function as is the more reflexive warmth of the clothing, or<br>
'inner contentment' of belief.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;For subjects with little social monitoring and strong personal penalties</i><br>
<i>&gt;for incorrect beliefs, we expect the functional role of beliefs to</i><br>
<i>&gt;dominate.  Beliefs about small military missions or small engineering</i><br>
<i>&gt;projects come to mind.  But for subjects with high social interest and</i><br>
<i>&gt;little personal penalty for mistakes, we expect the social role of beliefs</i><br>
<i>&gt;to dominate.  Consider beliefs about large elections or beliefs addressing</i><br>
<i>&gt;abstract philosophical, religious, or scientifc questions.</i><br>
<p>
That assumes that the social role is less important than the functional<br>
role merely because of the size of the 'society' involved. Why should that<br>
be the case? Consider the mass suicides of cult members. These are small<br>
societies, yet it is the social role, I would submit, which causes the<br>
society following its leader and destroying itself. Perhaps the key here is<br>
your phrase 'with little social monitoring': social is a relativistic term;<br>
societies are myriad, inter-linked, sub-classed and interactive. An<br>
argument based around the societal function of belief cannot presume a<br>
single society against which to measure things such as monitoring.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If people could wear a parka undetected underneath a bikini, bikinis might</i><br>
<i>&gt;be in fashion in the Arctic, and Arctic folks wouldn't need to trade</i><br>
<i>&gt;off the functional and social roles of clothes.</i><br>
<p>
One could argue that there is no trade-off at the moment. Warm clothes<br>
function to keep the wearer alive, but also allow the wearer to move in an<br>
outside environment and hence socially interact with others. (And I would<br>
argue that this is a function of the clothes.) If your implication is that<br>
the wearing of bikinis would allow the people of the Artic to fulfil a<br>
further social role, then I think it is based on very Claifornia-centric<br>
cultural beliefs: attraction is a very culturally-relative thing, and I'm<br>
sure the people of the Artic have there own 'bikini-substitute'.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Similarly, if people</i><br>
<i>&gt;could choose their external behavior independently of their internal</i><br>
<i>&gt;beliefs, then internal beliefs would never need to be anything but our</i><br>
<i>&gt;best computationally-feasible estimate of the way things really are.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt;since it is typically hard to say one think and believe another, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;functional and social roles of beliefs do conflict.</i><br>
<p>
Consciously it is very easy to say one thing and believe another; in ones<br>
everyday actions and interactions it may be more difficult. But does that<br>
mean that the functional and social roles of beliefs conflict? I don't see<br>
why that should follow. As I argue above, the social role of belief is one<br>
of its non-reflexive functions. Furthermore, whilst belief may drive social<br>
interaction, so may social interaction drive belief; Saul becomes Paul on<br>
the road to Damascus. If one has a belief and acts upon it, where is the<br>
conflict? If one wishes to act in a certain way but is prevented from doing<br>
so by ones own belief system then one has a choice to make between amending<br>
ones belief system or not acting in that way. But that is a choice to be<br>
made, and, more likely than not, is one which will be made within the<br>
context of the pre-existing belief system: belief system therefore informs<br>
social action, and vice-versa. There is a dialogue between the two, not a<br>
conflict.<br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;espcially the academically-neglected social role of beliefs.</i><br>
<p>
This is an area in which that are huge amounts of anthropological<br>
literature available. Indeed, given the nature of ethnographic study, one<br>
is almost forced to construct any paper on the basis of social role.<br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;the social costs of mistaken beliefs about politics and UFOs probably</i><br>
<i>&gt;can't be reduced...</i><br>
<p>
Which society? Mistaken in whose opinion? (Perhaps we should find<br>
'mistaken' books and burn them?)<br>
