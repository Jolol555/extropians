I admit that discussions about uploading require analyses that<br>
look like excercises in applied philosophy, but let's be a<br>
little bit careful. We can end up wasting time on questions that<br>
can be demonstrated to be unanswerable. Such questions are IMO<br>
content-free, and are thereby in the same class with unfalsifiable<br>
hypotheses.<br>
