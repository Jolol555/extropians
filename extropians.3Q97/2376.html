Thanks, I don't want to be doing things that have already been done.  I was<br>
thinking of selling to banks, with multiple layers of redundancy and backup<br>
it might be able to save some of those billions of dollars that get lost<br>
every year (for a percentage, of course ;-).  Now where did I put that<br>
drawing board?<br>
<p>
--Wax, who's going to think of something original, one of these days.<br>
