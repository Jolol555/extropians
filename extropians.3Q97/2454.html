     I noticed a big full page ad in Section A of the SF Chronicle today <br>
     which attempted to dispel concerns about people eating at Burger King <br>
     (due to the E coli scare linked to their meat distributor). I am <br>
     struck by the minimal amount of effort it takes to lull the public at <br>
     large back into a state of denial about the quality of food they <br>
     consume, not to mention the sources and conditions under which this <br>
     type of "food" is made available.  <br>
     <br>
     Accountability once again is the buzzword.  It would be interesting to <br>
     get the real skinny on how this large scale recall came about.  Was it <br>
     an unfortunate and largely unpreventable accident?  Is it mounting <br>
     carelessness and lack of thorough quality control?  Do the workers in <br>
     the meat-processing plants give a rat's ass what the general public <br>
     throw down their gullets?  Do the FDA inspectors?  Do the stockholders <br>
     of the companies supplying meat along its journey from Bessie to <br>
     Whopper? IMO, here is another instance where the myopic focus on <br>
     profit and the growing apathy associated with meaningless work <br>
     comingle and the result?  People getting sick from contanimated meat.  <br>
     Thousands of cows, their lives, their waste, their grain consumption <br>
     wasted.  Maybe one plus is that it provides a sobering slap in the <br>
     face for a completely heartless industry.<br>
     <br>
     This weekend at the Renaissance Faire (which would've really been <br>
     enjoyable had I not felt a minute-by-minute pressure to buy this or <br>
     that by the incessant hawkers), I tried a marinated soy meat which was <br>
     being used in place of a BBQ beef product and it was quite good!  The <br>
     Burger Nouveau patties (for those of you fortunate enough to have <br>
     access to Trader Joe's) meet my still-carnivorous taste standards.  <br>
     <br>
     Why are the fast food chains not making anything more than SALAD and <br>
     very whimpy burritos available to people who want a quick, vegetarian <br>
     bite on the go?  Their fervent endorsement of beef and poultry at the <br>
     expense of cruel and unusual treatment that, were it a cat, dog or <br>
     monkey, they'd be hauled off to jail.  The animals' death is the most <br>
     merciful part of their existence!  Their lives (particularly the <br>
     chickens) are a living hell (if chickens could conceive hell that is).<br>
     <br>
     We've talked about the primitiveness of emotions and how animals (like <br>
     dogs and cats) obviously express fondness, fear, their desire for <br>
     food, their annoyance at being left alone.  Chickens may be stupid, by <br>
     our measure, but to sear their beaks off and cram them into cages <br>
     where, if they don't become sick, they go whacko from not being able <br>
     to scratch and have any space at all.  The ones that do not hold up in <br>
     these chicken concentration camps go to the soup vat.  The heartier <br>
     ones I imagine end up in the poultry department, Boston Market and the <br>
     Colonel's.  Again, their demise ends up being the best thing they <br>
     could hope (if they could hope) for.<br>
     <br>
     I've read that we already have the technology to GROW chicken muscle, <br>
     independent of it being part of a live, "emoting" chicken.  Does <br>
     anyone know about the progress of such technology.  The inhumanity of <br>
     our current livestock processing is galling and totally paradoxical to <br>
     the otherwise growing perception that animals have rights.<br>
     <br>
     So, there are a few points here that I'd like to put on the table:<br>
     <br>
     * the viability of emotions expressed by animals.  What is it that <br>
     makes those emotions sacrasanct, giving them the weight that promotes <br>
     being more merciful?<br>
     <br>
     * the technology of employing soy meat subsitutes or growing chicken <br>
     "meat" without the chicken in a biotechnical capacity.<br>
     <br>
     * the justification for maintaining a diet that has apathy, cruelty <br>
     and exploitiveness as its cornerstones (as still a majority of <br>
     westerns still do).<br>
     <br>
