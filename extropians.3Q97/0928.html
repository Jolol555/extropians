That's very true. Perhaps it is the immutable character of the<br>
IQ score that makes people afraid of it. If you are low on education<br>
you can get some more, at least in principle; but if you have a <br>
low IQ that means you are stupid and there's nothing that can be<br>
done. Then there is also the embarrasing racial aspect of it. Many<br>
people believe that it would have bad consequences for society if<br>
a parameter became generally recognised as importantly correlated<br>
with performance when the average value of that parameter differs<br>
strongly between different ethnic groups.<br>
As for the applicant who puts his IQ on the application form, he<br>
would of course not be prosecuted, but maybe the employer would, if<br>
he used such information on a large scale. As far as I know, it is<br>
actually not legal in the USA to use IQ-like tests in hiring <br>
decisions, unless that specific test has been specifically proven<br>
to be a reliable predictor of the specific task the man is hired<br>
for. Developing a specialised task test, and proving its reliablity,<br>
is usually so expensive and problematic that companies prefer to<br>
use other methods.<br>
I don't know about the situation in other countires where it might<br>
be fully legal.<br>
