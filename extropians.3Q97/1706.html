It will be interesting to see how this comes out, but I thought the<br>
announcement was premature.  Most of the media carried this as though<br>
cloning had occured.  What they actually showed was a cow cloned from<br>
fetal cells, not from adult cells.  As I understand it, making "artificial<br>
twins" has been possible for years by splitting embryos.  This is a<br>
technical advance but the implications are not that different from what<br>
was already possible.<br>
<p>
Once the cows from the adult cells are born, they'll have to be checked to<br>
make sure they are in fact clones (nothing went wrong during the nuclear<br>
transfer, etc.).  So there is more work to be done before the claims of<br>
"breakthrough" are justified.  All the hype has made me a bit suspicious.<br>
