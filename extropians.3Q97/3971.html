Eeeh.. Joao. Listen... You've got to try to respect the *other* viewpoint.<br>
I know, it's hard sometimes but if you want to convice anyone on this list<br>
you'll have to show consideration and understanding for their opinion,<br>
Otherwise you just get flamed or igored. Using words like 'kills' and<br>
'greedy' in this context will make the discussion very emotional an hardly<br>
contructive.<br>
<p>
Of course if you just want to vent some frustrations about the mess the<br>
world is in that's ok too. Several list members do that regurlaly here. ;-)<br>

So Ev, you mean to teel me that in free market a company like Micro$oft<br>
with a technically very faulty product and *no* customer support would<br>
die-off?<br>
In that case: bring 'em on! I have some doubts on this howerver.<br>

Shall we make that uneducated? That's a bit more respectful and I think<br>

<p>
Living in Holland (I did mention this before i think ;-) and having studied<br>
Global Warming as part of the Science &amp; Policy Program at Utrecht<br>
University I feel obliged to make some comments here.<br>
<p>
Environmental issues can be extremely complex. And many are not yet<br>
understood by anyone. The greenhouse-effect (also known as global warming)<br>
is a very good example of an environmental issue that could turn out to be<br>
a very big problem or not a problem at all. We just don't know for sure.<br>
<p>
Thing is, if we wait 'till we do know for sure and it turns out that it is<br>
a problem it will be too late to remedy the situation. And although the<br>
idea of planetwide climate-physics experiment does have some apeal (we like<br>
experiments, right?) methinks it should be put off untill we have a back-up<br>
planet.<br>
<p>
The reason Holland is supposedly (so far practically nil) doing something<br>
about the greenhouse effect is not because we fear the rising of sea-levels<br>
so much. We don't. Large parts of holland are already 4.5 meters below<br>
sea-level so another meter or so should not cause us too much difficulty.<br>
If we just wanted to protect *our* coast-line it would be best for us to<br>
*not* restrict the output of CO2 at all (our contribution as a country is<br>
negligible in the global picture anyway) and retain maximum economic<br>
growth. We'd use the money to further upgrade our dike-system. We will do<br>
this anyway (we have spent about $1000 billion on this the past 30 years,<br>
we'll spend another $500 billion in the next 20 years). We'll be safe &amp;<br>
dry, can do, no problem.<br>
<p>
But there seems to be the matter of 'setting an example' that a lot of<br>
Dutch politician are fond of (reflected also in drugspolicy, but that's<br>
another thread). The fact that 200 million inhabitants of Bangla Desh (a<br>
poor country unable to build dike systems) die of cholera and hunger is<br>
somewhat disturbing, apparently.<br>
<p>
If CO2 causes a climate change (no-one knows for sure at this point) the<br>
country's that will be hit hardest will be those that already have big<br>
problems. Coastal regions will suffer an increased frequency of flooding,<br>
causing cholera epidemics. The rising of average global temperature will<br>
improve living comditions for disease spreading insects, an estimated 50<br>
million additional deaths per year by malaria alone could result (UN-ICCP<br>
study).<br>
The Sahel country's will become unfit to support human life, were will al<br>
these people go? Spanjards be afraid, 250 million Africans are coming for a<br>
visit.<br>
<p>
Today the world population is about 5,83 billion, doubling time is about 43<br>
years and still decreasing. So in the real disaster scenario a fairly<br>
sudden (10 year) climate change hits is by total suprise in 2040. And<br>
voting for the other guy does no good of course. Global pop. is 10-14<br>
billion, oil reserves are nil, natural gas has been depleted in 2030. No<br>
more energy to make artifical ferilizer. Food procuction comes crashing<br>
down. People start dying like flies, we're talking 8-14 BILLION deaths<br>
here. After a while a new equilibrium will be reached, lots of room for<br>
everybody. Still no oil but we'll figure something.<br>
<p>
Then we (some of us, the live ones) rebuild, somehow...<br>
<p>
Hey! don't worry, maybe it won't happen (I'll make a T-shirt of this for<br>
the next climate-physics-team reunion, have a laugh!)<br>
<p>
While in the Science &amp; policy Program I spent a half a year working on<br>
predictive models for the economical and eclogical effects of possible<br>
climate change scenario's. The above was one of our less positive ones.<br>
Having observed policy making-in-progress in both the Netherlands and other<br>
country's like the US I have come to the conclusion that global warming<br>
should be seen as a dinosaur-killer meteorite: we get hit, or we don't. We<br>
stay lucky or most of us get dead.<br>
<p>
Do not have the illusion that democratic governements can influence<br>
problems of this magnitude. They cannot, neither can the free market.<br>
Democracy has a planning period of about 4-years, politicians work to get<br>
things right at re-election time. The free market has a *much* shorter<br>
planning period than that, stockholders want a yearly return. For adressing<br>
climate change you need to be able to plan 50 years ahead. Only a very<br>
nasty totalitarian state could do such a thing. I do not want to live in a<br>
totalitarian state.<br>
I'll take my chances and support any politican who's pro-dike ;-)<br>
<p>
Homo Sapiens will survive, but if things go bad not more than 5-10% of them.<br>
<p>
Am I being a bit cynical here, yes I am. We are taking an awfully big risk<br>
with the only planet we have. We do not *know* we'll have nano-tech or<br>
nuclearfusion or a singularity to get us out of our troubles. I'm hoping<br>
for it, but I'm not sure. So it worries me a bit sometimes.<br>
<p>
So let's get some radical new tech before then, back to work! One of my<br>
co-conspiritors in the Dutch Transhuman Society 'Excedo' is developing a<br>
plan to set up a small nano-tech R&amp;D company. We're busy, we're trying.<br>
Woman and children first... and keep kicking!<br>

Joao, could you send me this document by E-mail to &lt;mountain@knoware.nl&gt;. I<br>
might have some use for this knowledge in the future (I do a lot of 4000+<br>
meter climbing), or it could be an intersting read. many thanks.<br>
