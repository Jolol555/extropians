In a message dated 97-08-25 15:41:23 EDT, you write: <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; It would be interesting to  <br>
      get the real skinny on how this large scale recall came about.&gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
The problem was NOT _E. coli_, that would be ridiculous because ALL RAW<br>
mammalian meat is contaminated with _E. coli_, there is no control known that<br>
will eliminate it under standard procedures.  Gamma irradiation is not<br>
standard yet for beef.  The main control is COOKING the raw meat and kitchen<br>
sanitization.   <br>
 <br>
The problem *was* that the hamburger was contaminated with _E. coli_<br>
O157:H7--the special strain that causes bleeding and sometimes death.  This<br>
was not the normal strain of _E coli_ you and I have by the 100s of billions<br>
inside us normally.  That's right EVEN the vegitarians!  <br>
 <br>
So,. . . There are also no controls in raw beef for this 0157:H7 strain, for<br>
the same reasons as the normal _E. coli_.  Cooking is the control.<br>
 (_Salmonella_ is on all chicken and is uncontrolled, too.  Again, the<br>
control is cooking and kitchen sanitization.)  <br>
<p>
The FDA has (at least in the past) said: <br>
1.  since you can't control _E. coli_ don't even monitor for it, because it<br>
is normal.   <br>
2.  you must monitor for O157:H7 because we are getting heat from the public.<br>
 So they issued a special advisory asking O157:H7 be monitored January 1997.<br>
 The FDA will add a law forcing the monitoring and control of O157:H7 in the<br>
new HACCP rules this will be mandatory on December 12, 1997. <br>
3.  even then, if you find it you do not HAVE to recall your product, but it<br>
is highly suggested.<br>
6.  since there are no really good controls for raw beef,  you are out of<br>
luck unless you gamma irradiate your beef.  But, some people don't what you<br>
do to that either. <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;  Was it  <br>
      an unfortunate and largely unpreventable accident? &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
At this point cooking and kitchen sanitization are the prevention.  There is<br>
no effective prevention for raw beef.  <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; Is it mounting  <br>
      carelessness and lack of thorough quality control?&gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
It is a lack of a good raw beef (raw means uncooked) control for _E. coli_ <br>
And some food sellers let raw (no antimicrobial control) beef be consumed, by<br>
undercooking it.  <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;  Do the workers in  <br>
      the meat-processing plants give a rat's ass what the general public  <br>
      throw down their gullets? &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
Maybe, but _E. coli_ is "normal."  The meat processing people don't even<br>
consider it a problem, because cooking is thought to be the control, not<br>
them.  They have no controls really, they never have had controls (besides<br>
the poor ones listed below). <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; Do the FDA inspectors?&gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
What can the inspectors really do if there is no microbial controls for _E<br>
coli_ in beef?  Well, they look at it, check for gross problems, look to see<br>
if a lot of intestinal matter is being ground in, check temperatures, and<br>
equipment sanitization and make sure the batch records are adequate in case a<br>
recall is recommended.  But, that's about it. <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;  Do the stockholders  <br>
      of the companies supplying meat . . . &gt;&gt; <br>
  <br>
They had better, because right now their companies are in danger of being<br>
shut down and they will loose their investment. <br>
