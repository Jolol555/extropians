Received this very long mailing on the internal mailingsystem. Cleaned it a<br>
bit for readability and because of security issues. I've not been able to<br>
confirm this independently, If anyone can please let me know.<br>

// snipped lots of header info //<br>

<i> &gt;I wish to warn you about a new crime ring that is targeting business</i><br>
<i> &gt;travelers. This ring is well organized, well funded, has very skilled</i><br>
<i> &gt;personnel, and is currently in most major cities and recently very</i><br>
<i> &gt;active in New Orleans. The crime begins when a business traveler goes</i><br>
<i> &gt;to a lounge for a drink at the end of the work day. A person in the bar</i><br>
<i> &gt;walks up as they sit alone and offers to buy them a drink. The last</i><br>
<i> &gt;thing the traveler remembers until they wake up in a hotel room bath</i><br>
<i> &gt;tub, their body submerged to their neck in ice, is sipping that drink.</i><br>
<i> &gt;There is a note taped to the wall instructing them not to move and  to</i><br>
<i> &gt;call 911. A phone is on a small table next to the bathtub for them to</i><br>
<i> &gt;call. The business traveler calls 911 who have become quite familiar</i><br>
<i> &gt;with this crime. The business traveler is instructed by the 911 operator</i><br>
<i> &gt;to very slowly and carefully reach behind them and feel if there is  a</i><br>
<i> &gt;tube protruding from their lower back. The business traveler finds the</i><br>
<i> &gt;tube and answers, "Yes." The 911 operator tells them to remain still,</i><br>
<i> &gt;having already sent paramedics to help. The operator knows that both</i><br>
<i> &gt;of the business traveler's kidneys have been harvested.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt;This is not a scam or out of a science fiction novel, it is real. It is</i><br>
<i> &gt;documented and confirmable. If you travel or someone close to you</i><br>
<i> &gt;travels, please be careful.</i><br>

<i> &gt;Yes, this does happen. My sister-in-law works with a lady that this</i><br>
<i> &gt;happened to her son's neighbor who lives in Houston. The only  "good"</i><br>
<i> &gt;thing to his whole story is the fact that the people doing this horrible</i><br>
<i> &gt;crime are very in tune to what complications can happen afterwards</i><br>
<i> &gt;because of the details precautions they take the time to set up before</i><br>
<i> &gt;leaving the room. The word from my sister-in-law is that the hospital</i><br>
<i> &gt;in Las Vegas (yes, Vegas) prior to transferring him back to Houston</i><br>
<i> &gt;stated that these people know exactly what they are doing. The incision,</i><br>
etc.<br>
<i> &gt;was exact and clean. They use sterile equipment etc. and the hospital</i><br>
<i> &gt;stated that other than the fact that the victim looses a kidney there</i><br>
<i> &gt;has not been any reports of other complications due to non-sterile,</i><br>
<i> &gt;etc. tactics that were used.</i><br>

<i> &gt;Sadly, this is very true. My husband is a Houston Firefighter/EMT and</i><br>
<i> &gt;they have received alerts regarding this crime ring. It is to be taken</i><br>
<i> &gt;very seriously. The daughter of a friend of a fellow firefighter had</i><br>
<i> &gt;this happen to her. Skilled doctor's are performing these crimes!</i><br>
<i> &gt;(which, by the way have been highly noted in the Las Vegas area)</i><br>
<i> &gt;Additionally, the military has received alerts regarding this.</i><br>

<i> &gt;This guy went out last Saturday night to a party.  He was having a good</i><br>
<i> &gt;time, had a couple  of beers and some girl seemed to like him and</i><br>
<i> &gt;invited him to go to another party.  He quickly agreed and decided to</i><br>
<i> &gt;go along with her. She took him to a party in some apartment and they</i><br>
<i> &gt;continued to drink, and even got involved with some other drugs.</i><br>
<i> &gt;The next thing he knew, he woke up completely naked in a</i><br>
<i> &gt;bathtub filled with ice. He was still feeling the effects of the drugs,</i><br>
<i> &gt;but looked around to see he was alone. He looked down at his chest, which</i><br>
<i> &gt;had "CALL 911 OR YOU WILL DIE" written on it in lipstick. He saw a phone</i><br>
<i> &gt;was on a stand next to the tub, so he picked it up and dialed. He</i><br>
<i> &gt;explained to the EMS operator what the situation was and that he didn't</i><br>
<i> &gt;know where he was, what he took, or why he was really calling. She</i><br>
<i> &gt;advised him to get out of the tub. He did, and she asked him to look</i><br>
<i> &gt;himself over in  the mirror. He did, and appeared normal, so she told</i><br>
<i> &gt;him to check his back. He did, only to find two 9 inch slits on his</i><br>
<i> &gt;lower back. She told him to get  back in the tub immediately, and they</i><br>
<i> &gt;sent a rescue team over. Apparently, after being examined, he found</i><br>
<i> &gt;out more of what had happened. His kidneys were stolen. They are worth</i><br>
<i> &gt;10,000 dollars  each on the black market. (I was unaware this even existed.)</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Several guesses are in order: The second party was a sham, the people</i><br>
<i> &gt;involved had to be at least medical students, and it was not just</i><br>
<i> &gt;recreational drugs he was given. Regardless, he is currently in the</i><br>
<i> &gt;hospital on life support, awaiting a spare kidney. The University of</i><br>
<i> &gt;Texas in conjunction with Baylor University Medical Center is conducting</i><br>
<i> &gt;tissue research to match the sophomore student with a donor.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Any information leading to the arrest of the individuals may be</i><br>
<i> &gt;forwarded to the University of Texas Campus police, or the Texas Rangers.</i><br>

Are you still with me?<br>
I tend to think I don't shock easily but this shut me up for a couple of<br>
minutes... Not just what they did but the way they did it.<br>
<p>
Ev, if you run into the monsters doing this stuff... <br>
    do just that: run into them - full speed.<br>
<p>
We really need to push the bio-tech reasearch that will allow us to use pig<br>
kidneys or such (I've heard of pighearts as donororgans), as<br>
transplantation technology becomes more advanced the shortage of organs<br>
will rise, and thus their black-market value.<br>
<p>
Two points:<br>
<p>
1) Why is it that only about 20% of the population caries a document that<br>
allow doctors to use their organs in case of sudden death, while over 90%<br>
of the population wishes to receive donororgans if it can save (=extend)<br>
their life.<br>
(figures relate to the Netherlands)<br>
It seems to me that it's rather strange that people who are willing to have<br>
their organs used die waiting for organs that are being used by people who<br>
would not have made their tissues available for their fellow human.<br>
Maybe their should be seperate waiting lists. You don't have to give<br>
consent for tissuedonation, but then you face the consequences if your<br>
lottery ticket comes up.<br>
<p>
2) If we extend that principle (I'm treading on dangerous ground here) it<br>
could be argued that people that expose themselves to certain health risks<br>
(diet, sports or certain drugs) should have a lower priority in case of<br>
tissue shortages. Everybody is free to live the way they please but when<br>
that's one liver for two people the person that is a personal friend &amp;<br>
customer of Jack Daniels maybe should not get it (all other variables being<br>
equal).<br>
I do a lot of mountaineering myself and because of that I pay an extra<br>
insurance fee to cover the higher-than-average medical costs. I do not<br>
consider this an unreasonable demand. It's my choice to climb (and get hurt<br>
every now and then).<br>
I should pay the extra costs of patching me up when something goes wrong.<br>
<p>
3) I'm not a doctor but the 'retrieval' operation described would cost some<br>
serious money, how can they make a profit that makes it worth the risks?<br>
It's a bit morbid but I can't help being curious.<br>
<p>
Kind regards,<br>
