So far the examples mentioned here are for military aircraft. What about<br>
small planes for the average Joe pilot, like Piper Cubs??<br>

<p>
I tend to hope that the transhuman ideal includes being less screwed up.<br>
We are learning more and more about redesign, and Nature isn't the most<br>
logical designer around... AFAIK, Dilbert is in the wrong future here...<br>
