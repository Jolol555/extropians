Actually, the above passage was written by me, not Michael Lorrey.  And<br>
the fact is, Joao, that the replies you received (with all due respect<br>
to their posters) were fairly brief and by no means comprehensive. The<br>
points you raised take essays, monographs and books to deal with<br>
adequately. To say that you haven't been persuaded of a position on the<br>
basis of a few brief responses is intellectually foolish. To arrive at a<br>
justifiable conclusion regarding such issues requires much more research<br>
and thought than this.<br>
<p>
I may be doing you an injustice, but I get the strong feeling from your<br>
posting that your initial questions were not a serious requst for<br>
information. One sees this all the time on the net. Someone posts a set<br>
of elementary questions about libertaranism or free market economics or<br>
whatever - all of which are actually dealt with in the primary<br>
literature of their respective subjects. When the poster receives some<br>
answers he or she then responds with polemical and ill-considered<br>
arguments, clearly indicating that they were not really making an honest<br>
inquiry in the first place, but were simply looking for an argument.<br>
Which is another reason why many people can't be bothered to reply. <br>
<p>
If you are really interested in learning about anything READ BOOKS!  If<br>
you think book reading is "boring" you clearly have little interest in<br>
acquiring knowledge.<br>
