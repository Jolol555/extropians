And it all comes back to my post "anarchy and spontaneous order in business<br>

People in the area of research of computing in eduation have found that<br>
dysfunctional children and children with learning difficulties take to<br>
computers easier than those without.  It has also been found that children in<br>
non-technical societies (third world countries) take to computing as easily<br>
as those from high-tech societies.  It seems, as ever, computers are the<br>
great equaliser.  Except in cost, what if our libraries started loaning<br>
computers?<br>
