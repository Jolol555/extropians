<i>&gt;What I'm afraid of are all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;fools who feel that they need them and who don't choose to understand what</i><br>
<i>&gt;limited purposes firearms have.</i><br>
<p>
A.M, you have my genuine thanks for skipping the verbal jousting and<br>
speaking about the real issue. I'll drop the jousting too.<br>
<p>
When I encounter such, I get angry, and I try to straighten them out.<br>
Anger is, arguably, closely related to fear and powerlessness; I<br>
acknowledge that.<br>
<p>
Fools, we will have always with us, to paraphrase the New Testament.<br>
But I know many honest, civil people, not fools; what of them? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As far as I'm concerned, the less guns we have the better off we are.</i><br>
<p>
If I were still jousting, I'd say something like:<br>
Fine. Give up yours, I'll keep mine, the net reduction in number should be<br>
a net gain for society... yes?<br>
<p>
But I'm not jousting. So instead I'll say:<br>
A.M., rest assured that I do not apologize for the actions of said fools. I<br>
just resent being lumped in with them because I haven't proven to some<br>
other fool that I can be trusted more than said fool trusts him/herself.<br>
<p>
If I had a device that could instantly neutralize all firearms all over the<br>
world--make them inert lumps of metal, permanently... I *might* push the<br>
button that did it.<br>
<p>
But I'd think really hard for a long time before I did. And I mistrust<br>
anyone who tells me they would do it in an instant. How about you?<br>
