He had his daughter Luna cryopreserved, so he at least was pro-cryonics.<br>

<i>&gt; 1)  Can anyone explain to me what's going on psychologically with people</i><br>
<i>&gt; who are on death's door?  How can they spend so much of their thought-time</i><br>
<i>&gt; getting the rest of us to value life so much, only to be willing and ready</i><br>
<i>&gt; to give up life in favor of death the nearer it approaches?</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps cognitive dissonance? They know they approach death, and they<br>
value life, so to avoid mental pain they begin to value death too. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2)  Does anyone have any suggestions for what we can do to prevent this? </i><br>
<i>&gt; How many more of our luminaries will go gently, peacefully into oblivion</i><br>
<i>&gt; before we begin to stem the tide?  </i><br>
<p>
As long as the best we can present is cryonics, I think they will<br>
continue to slip through into oblivion (cryonics, while intellectually<br>
appealing, lacks the necessary emotional "strength" to resist the<br>
very powerful psychological pressures on the old and dying, both<br>
from others and themselves). As soon as we have something that can<br>
be shown to work at least sometimes, then people will come rushing.<br>
<p>
So my advice is: research, research, research (but what did you<br>
expect from a scientist? :-) And perhaps try to create a stronger<br>
emotional framework around cryonics; making it a religion might<br>
work, although the side effects would likely be troublesome. <br>
