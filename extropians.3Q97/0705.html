<i>&gt;I don't see why it carries a vested interest in preserving the binary</i><br>
<i>&gt;sex system.</i><br>
<p>
Woof, where do I begin?  Most directly, the medical profession exists <br>
as an extension of the society that it resides in, as evidenced by <br>
the different medical codes prevalent in various cultures. <br>
<p>
There is a long and sordid history of medical science being used <br>
against persons who do not conform to whatever the contemporary <br>
gender stereotypes happened to be at the time.  In fact, as the <br>
gender perceptions changed, so did the treatments inflicted upon gay or <br>
transgendered persons and the populations targeted also changed.  We would <br>
like to think in this modern era that we have moved past all that, <br>
but gender 'anomalous' persons still suffer tremendous abuse at the <br>
hands of doctors and psychiatrists in the name of 'curing' or <br>
'normalization'.  Aversion therapy, reparative therapy, involuntary <br>
surgery, involuntary commitment or imprisonment, beatings and torture <br>
occur with such frequency even in Western countries that Amnesty <br>
International has added sexual orientation to its charter and <br>
produces an annual report of such abuse yearly (my copy is outdated, <br>
so I won't quote stats).<br>
<p>
If you were to take a poll of your gay/bi/les/trans friends, chances <br>
are that a majority could recount some experience, ranging from <br>
unpleasant to terrifying, that involved a medical or psychiatric <br>
professional.  Those who live in rural areas, out of access to a gay or <br>
trans-friendly clinic often skip necessary treatment altogether.  <br>
Recent examples:  (i) Loree Cook-Daniels, is compiling a study on elder <br>
abuse and already finds a very high incidence of mistreatment and <br>
abuse of gay and trans patients by the staff, more so than in the wider <br>
patient population.  (ii) In Washington, D.C., last year a transgendered <br>
person was left to bleed to death in the street by paramedics who <br>
stood by and ridiculed him, and a gay man who was stabbed was also <br>
denied treatment and had to find his way to the hospital on his own.  <br>
(iii) In my home town, a man known to be gay was left to bleed to death <br>
in the corner of the emergency room.<br>
<p>
In the world of psychiatry, the Bem Sex Survey, an instrument used to <br>
determine whether a person is 'masculine' or 'feminine' has come <br>
under fire because more and more persons are scoring as <br>
'androgynous'.  Rather than undertake an examination of how this <br>
might indicate some serious human evolution, researchers are calling for <br>
a new instrument that would definitively score persons as masculine and <br>
feminine, thus preserving the division.  Such an approach could not <br>
possibly reflect a 'conservative' approach by these researchers, <br>
because it blatantly ignores the data.<br>
<p>
I wish I could remember the name of the book, but it can be found in <br>
university bookstores, a history of medical treatments directed <br>
against gay/bi/les/trans persons in modern history, and the thing is <br>
over five inches thick, small print, dense documentation and <br>
citation.  It recounts the instances individuals singled out for 'treatment' <br>
for not adhering to physcial and psychological expectations for their <br>
assigned gender.  In some cases, student populations in high schools and <br>
universities were screened against the worst stereotypes and <br>
assumptions, and women who did not look feminine enough were <br>
particularly singled out for further 'treatment' or 'counseling'.    <br>
<p>
I could go one, but this message is rather long and plenty of <br>
literature exists on the topic, not to mention plenty of persons <br>
willing to recount their expereriences if asked.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
