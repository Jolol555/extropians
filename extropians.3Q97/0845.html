My question was, given that (perhaps unsorted, perhaps<br>
not all perfect) "adamantine" building blocks can<br>
be synthesized using "traditional" chemistry, and then<br>
sorted and oriented using an STM, Then how to you hook them<br>
together using the STM. If I understand your reply, you<br>
are discussing "harsh conditions" in solution phase. Does<br>
the STM have to operate in a solution-phase environment?<br>
I had assumed that the building blocks could be deposited<br>
on a suitable work surface for the STM, and the environment<br>
then adjusted as needed (vacuum, noble gas, whatever.)<br>
Then you can employ the STM to sort and orient. At this point<br>
you aren't in solution phase, but you aren't in machine phase<br>
either. You are in "STM phase", or something. Now, is there a<br>
way to hook the blocks together?<br>
<p>
As is doubtless painfully obvious, I'm no chemist. My mental<br>
model, using "blocks" and "hook together", may be so grossly<br>
oversimplified as to be worthless. If so, let me know.<br>
<p>
Thanks.<br>
