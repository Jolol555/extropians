Interesting. So are you saying that it simply doesn't matter if<br>
a politician is (or all politicians are) lacking in character?<br>
Or if a political system reliably produces (rewards, whatever)<br>
only politicians who are lacking in character?<br>
<p>
Dear Eric and other fellow Extropians,<br>
Although I did not mention constructive ethical and moral behavior in my<br>
comments relating to the formation of public policy, I thought that it<br>
would be understood that a strong ethical and moral foundation is apriori<br>
in this regard.<br>
An error in judgement is the assumption that politicians make policy.<br>
Actually, mostly they primarily make a great deal of flatulating noises<br>
which the media dutifully reports as policy statements. The reality of the<br>
siuation is that numerous analysts collect as many facts as possible prior<br>
to a policy proposal and jointly present a summary and analysis to those<br>
who make the ultimate determination. It should be pointed out that most<br>
policy is initiated and instituted within the various agencies of<br>
government. Only where enabling legislation and appropriations are<br>
required does the legislative branch become involved. Most policy<br>
determinations (either domestic or foreign) are never noticed by the<br>
general public.<br>

Also, I am interested to hear your theory of how a participant in<br>
the democratic process should go about following "the cumulative<br>
thought processes, constraints, and contingencies" when deciding<br>
how to vote.  Most of the methods I have run across for attempting<br>
to keep track of these things either seem unreliable (I had thought<br>
that character was a good guide, but now you seem to be telling us<br>
that it is not) or else to take up so much of my time in researching<br>
my vote that I have no time left in which to earn taxes for the<br>
state.  <br>
<p>
Dear Eric et al,<br>
This is a major part of the problem. Since the time of George Washington<br>
most people have been to preoccupied with their basic survival to pay much<br>
attention to the complexity inherant in the administration of a democracy.<br>
As with most professions, administration of government is an area of<br>
academic specialization. Initially, the profession of law was broad enough<br>
to include the social philosophies of the 18th and 19th centurys. As our<br>
society has evolved and become more complex, the arts and sciences have<br>
had to become more complex as well. There is now simply to much<br>
information for the "average" individual to absorb and convert to<br>
knowledge and, ultimately, wisdom.<br>
Possibly, through collective knowledge of the Extropians can we evolve<br>
further so that a greater percentage of our citizenry can develop the<br>
capacity to function on the broad and interdisciplinary level required for<br>
participation in the further evolution of humankind and its social and<br>
cultural structures.    <br>
********************************************<br>
This is especially the case where I live, in California, because<br>
we have an extensive system of initiative and referendum which<br>
requires a great deal of research to participate in in a meaningful<br>
way.  Of course, research is not literally *required*, so the<br>
results of the elections are sometimes a bit surrealistic.  I<br>
suppose that's why I like living in California.  I've always been<br>
fond of surrealism, and I find the political environment here<br>
to be quite Daliesque.<br>
<p>
(Oh, dear, I shouldn't have said that last.  It's clearly<br>
evidence that I need to get my head shrunk by professional<br>
help.  State-licensed, of course.)<br>
<p>
Dear Eric et al,<br>
I think you just stated my point from a different perspective in a far<br>
more succinct manner than I did. Obviously, I suspect that the research<br>
that is required to understand the long effects of any referendum or<br>
initiative is beyond the desire of most members of the public and the<br>
media.   <br>
