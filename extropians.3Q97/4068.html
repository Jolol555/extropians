EvMick, the claim "I don't know where to find it" on the internet is<br>
about the most lame excuse an individual can make in this life. About as<br>
bad as claiming to not know how to wipe one's own nose, or other bodily<br>
parts. I'll bet you that there isn't one subject that is on the web that<br>
I can't find with a search engine of my choice.<br>
<p>
It all comes down to individuals taking responsibility for their own<br>
education, and respect for others. What do you think the secretary of<br>
state would say if you walked into a Cabinet meeting and asked a basic<br>
question about the Presidency?<br>
