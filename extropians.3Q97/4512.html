Remi Sussan ecrit:<br>
: I'd prefer to ask: since the governement exists, and we cannot destroy<br>
: it next sunday after lunch, how to use it ? I prefer to see it feed the<br>
: homeless rather than using my money for army or making gifts to big<br>
: corporations....<br>
<p>
There's nothing the state loves more than people who try to use it,<br>
because they legitimize it.  You may start as an anarchist.  Then you<br>
say, well, we're stuck with the state, let's make the best of it.<br>
Then they've got you.  Because if the state ever *is* in danger of<br>
nonexistence, you'll be among those who rally to its defense -- to<br>
save the good things it does for the poor, of course.<br>
<p>
If the state makes gestures of feeding the poor, the trick for its<br>
opponents is to avoid being seduced, so we can say, "Your so-called<br>
compassionate gestures do not relieve you of the guilt of making them<br>
poor in the first place!  If you're serious about helping the poor,<br>
you'll repeal the licensing acts that keep them from supporting<br>
themselves - repeal the zoning acts that prevent the building of<br>
housing - repeal all the regulations that are designed to maintain<br>
high prices of food and other necessities!"<br>
<p>
: I suspect right-anarchist to use the<br>
: term "market" as a model of any kind of free interaction, as the left<br>
: anarchists see in "market" only one kind of interaction. "Free markets",<br>
: according to this definition,  is therefore,  to use Bateson's terms, a<br>
: "maximisation of one variable", which can be disastrous to the whole<br>
: system, built on many variables.<br>
<p>
What the left fail to understand is that money is only a medium<br>
through which we optimize and balance all the hidden variables<br>
of our desires.<br>
To maximize your money is to maximize the tools by which you can<br>
choose the goods and conditions you prefer, for whatever reason.<br>
Socialists want to guarantee food and shelter and medicine for all,<br>
all alike, of the kind and amount that "science" proclaims to be<br>
appropriate - and they treat each of these desiderata as if it were<br>
unrelated from the others; if the state budget won't cover all three,<br>
it would be sacrilege to choose between them; the budget must be<br>
expanded!  By magic, if necessary!<br>
Free-marketers want to make people richer, so that each has more<br>
freedom to *choose* the kind and quality of these things that each<br>
one prefers, giving each one the option to (for example) spend less<br>
on shelter (smaller apartment?) and more on specialized food.<br>
