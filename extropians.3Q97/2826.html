 <br>
 The one that wants to kill.<br>
<p>
[I disagree...no more than with the advent of swords, or gunpowder..]<br>
 <br>
 Besides, it's not going to be one psychotic, it's going to be entire<br>
psychotic<br>
 governments, or even the entire Chinese government which, though sane, might<br>
 realize it couldn't dominate a population with access to nanotechnology.<br>
 Give<br>
 the Chinese government nanotechnology and they will launch an all-out effort<br>
 to create a preemptive strike.<br>
<p>
[I consider governments per se to be psychotic...check out their activities<br>
...of any government and tell me this is sanity?  Pick a government...then<br>
transmorgify it into an "individual".  Would you classify that individual as<br>
sane? I fail to see where one psychotic government having nanotech in a world<br>
of defenseless individuals would be any better than two...or many psychotic<br>
governments having it]<br>
 <br>
 Add this to the advantage in relative development speeds ('mune is much more<br>
 complicated) and in strategy and tactics on the molecular level (as<br>
 discussed), and not only will there be a war, but the Chinese will win -<br>
that<br>
 is, if we confine ourselves to defense.<br>
<p>
[this humble one respectively disagrees...defense has an inherent advantage<br>
over offense I seem to recall...(supply lines, communication,,etc)...while<br>
nano is of a different order entirely than warfare...some of the same<br>
principles apply...specialization for example...mataglap (love that<br>
term...which I will use if there is no objection) being specially designed to<br>
destroy...should have difficulty adapting ]<br>
 <br>
 Now, the U.S. knows this as well as I do.  So do all the other governments. <br>
 They will revert to the tried and true doctrine of Mutual Assured<br>
Destruction.<br>
<p>
[I don't consider that to be a particularly successful tactic....rather it<br>
lives up to its acronym...and further reinforces my claim that governments<br>
are psychotic...Imagine two angry men...in an elevator...each with<br>
handgrenades with the pins pulled...glaring at each other....the<br>
inteligent..and sane...tactic would have been to proceed with a defensive<br>
system...]<br>
 <br>
 The end result is that all the governments have nano-arsenals.  None of them<br>
 trust each other.  As with Anti-Ballistic-Missile systems, any proposed<br>
'mune<br>
 will be treated as upsetting the balance of power.  Any attempt to set up a<br>
 'mune system would probably provoke a first strike.  Meanwhile, the Chinese<br>
 government is oppressing the living hell out of their populations.  All the<br>
 governments are doing their damndest to prohibit all nanotechnology to their<br>
 citizens.  And NOW these governments have the power to do WHATEVER THEY<br>
WANT...<br>
<p>
[I evision a scenario similar to computer viruses...but taken much more<br>
seriously...combined with that of fire towers in the west (or nuclear test<br>
observation sattelites)...mataglap defense programs would be readily<br>
available...close watch would be kept in case of an outbreak...when there was<br>
one everyone would be notified...and appropriate actions would be taken...on<br>
an individual as well as organizational level]<br>
 <br>
 Not that they'll be doing it for long.  Soon there will be a very short war.<br>
 <br>
 Giving nanotech to one person is taking a big chance.<br>
 Giving nanotech to all governments is simple suicide.<br>
 -- <br>
<i>    &gt;&gt;</i><br>
[As would giving it to ANY government exclusively...followed by an<br>
indeterminate period of population exploitation that government would<br>
fragment...thus providing the world with multiple nano which would then<br>
behave in typical childish, psychotic governmental fashion.<br>
<p>
I think everyone is discounting one of Vinge's predictions...the Other one<br>
besides that of the Singularity.<br>
<p>
That is that while governments and individuals are both gaining<br>
power...individuals are gaining it at a faster rate than that of the<br>
psychotics...er...governments...and that rate is accellerating...(now more so<br>
than ever with computers loose in the hands of individuals....and widespread<br>
communications)...eventually individuals will be as powerful as their<br>
contemperaneous governments....that is goverments will vanish...possibly<br>
taking on functions similar to that of PTA or Elk's club...or perhaps chamber<br>
of commerce...<br>
<p>
I can't wait myself....and as I take responsibility for my own self-defense<br>
now..(cops are a headache....all the PAPER WORK)...I expect to do so in the<br>
future<br>
