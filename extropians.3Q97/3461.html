Methinks most Extropians are relativly young, healty, white, highly<br>
educated/skilled (self-taught or otherwise), well-payed people that work<br>
40-80 hrs a week (more when they are driving trucks ;-). And they hold a<br>
firm belief that it is their effort and dicipline that gave them the<br>
recources that they have at their disposal. <br>
You won't find many members that lost their job/income/health-insurance at<br>
28 because of some crippling disease or are unable to do high-intensety<br>
work because of a mild form of schizophrenia.<br>
<p>
"Those who do not work, shall not eat. Those who cannot work... well, as<br>
long as they are not rotting on my doorstep it's really not my problem now<br>
is it?"<br>

<i> &gt;   I stand behind Holly, when I say that hard work sucks!  I can think</i><br>
<i> &gt;of alot of better things to do than working all the time.  Yes, I work</i><br>
<i> &gt;hard to, but only to get wealthy enough so I don't have to work like a</i><br>

<i> &gt;creating art and having fun.  </i><br>
<p>
Right. I do not work hard, I have never worked hard in my life except once,<br>
a few months in a Bosnian refugee camp (by far the worst-paying  - $0 - and<br>
most satisfying job I ever had).<br>
In spite of this I've been able to do stuff that most people only talk<br>
about (travel to six continents before my 25th, spend 2-3 months a year<br>
mountaineering all over the world... and so on). <br>
<p>
The *reason* I've been able to live this way is that I've been lucky to be<br>
born with some well-working brainfuctions and in a family that encouraged<br>
me to develop them. I firmly believe those two factors are of bigger<br>
influence than anything I've done. I believe I got were I am mainly by<br>
chance, because of my genes and the way I was raised by my parents. It's<br>
nothing to be proud of.<br>
<p>
Many other people did not receive a 140-IQ-brain and a talent for abstract<br>
thought, so on average they end up on the low end of the scale.<br>
Because of this I don't have a problem with re-allocation some of my<br>
resources to help them out. Also, if I get sick and can't work anymore<br>
others will do the same for me.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;If that is not your goal, I suggest you</i><br>
<i> &gt;re-examine your beliefs and reconsider even calling yourself an</i><br>
<i> &gt;'extropian'.  Extropianism is about combatting *all* limits to our</i><br>
<i> &gt;happiness and freedom.  'Hard Work' is just one of those limits I plan</i><br>
<i> &gt;on obliterating!  And so should you. If you don't, then I would</i><br>
<i> &gt;serious consider you go back to your protestant church and beg</i><br>
<i> &gt;forgiveness!</i><br>

Maybe we could invest a little of our precious think-time in developing<br>
ideas of what can be done now - with our current technology - for the 75%<br>
of the world population that has barely left the dark ages (if you don't<br>
believe this go visit countries like Tanzania or Pakistan - and avoid the<br>
tourist tracks).<br>
In light of their exploding populations it will be in our best interest to<br>
help them develop themselves. I we show we don't care, they won't either<br>
wich will leaves us with a growing potential for more pointless wars.<br>
Of course if we really don't care: why not kill them now and be done with it?<br>
China is using a lot of (as yet) irreplacable coal thet I am certain we<br>
could find some use for.<br>
<p>
The western world is consuming about 80% of the global natural resources<br>
while comprising only about 20% of the world population. Pretty soon<br>
developing country's are going to want some of those resources. Are we<br>
going to share or are we going to war to get what we want?<br>
I think the differences in reaction-time between the Gulf-war and the war<br>
in former Yugoslavia gives a hint - an oil well under Sarajevo would have<br>
saved thousands of lives.<br>
<p>
For most humans the world is a really shitty place, let's do something<br>
about it. We can afford to.<br>

As an afterthought, here's a text that I found a valuable lesson about<br>
hardwork &amp; trying harder:           (you can also find it at<br>
<a href="http://www.inspire.com">http://www.inspire.com</a>)<br>
<p>
QUANTUM_LEAP<br>
<p>
"I'm sitting in a quiet room at the Millcroft Inn, a peaceful little place<br>
hidden back among the pine trees about an hour out of Toronto.  It's just<br>
past noon, late July, and I'm listening to the desperate sounds of a life<br>
or death struggle going on a few feet away. <br>
<p>
There's a small fly burning out the last of its short life's energies in a<br>
futile attempt to fly through the glass of the windowpane.  The whining<br>
wings tell the poignant story of the fly's strategy - try harder. <br>
<p>
But it's not working. <br>
<p>
The frenzied effort offers no hope for survival. Ironically, the struggle<br>
is part of the trap. It is impossible for the fly to try hard enough to<br>
succeed at breaking through the glass. Nevertheless, this little insect<br>
has staked its life on reaching its goal through raw effort and<br>
determination. <br>
<p>
This fly is doomed. It will die there on the windowsill. Accross the<br>
room ten steps away, the door is open. Ten seconds of flying time and this<br>
small creature could reach the outside world it seeks.  With only a<br>
fraction of the effort now being wasted, it could be free of this<br>
self-imposed trap.  The breakthrough possibility is there.  It would be so<br>
easy. <br>
<p>
Why doesn't this fly try another approach, something dramatically<br>
different?  How did it get so locked in on the idea that this particular<br>
route, and determined effort, offer the most promise for success?  What<br>
logic is there in continuing, until death, to seek a breakthrough with<br>
'more of the same?'<br>
<p>
No doubt this approach makes sense to the fly.  Regrettably it's an idea<br>
that will kill. <br>
<p>
'Trying harder' isn't necessarily the solution to achieving more.  It may<br>
not offer any real promise for giving what you want out of life. <br>
Sometimes, in fact, it's a big part of the problem. <br>
<p>
If you stake your hopes for a breakthrough on trying harder than ever, you<br>
may kill your chances of success. <br>
<p>
Self-discipline and persistence are true virtues.  Over a lifetime they<br>
can make a powerful contribution to success and achievement.  They are<br>
fundamental to the development of your talents. It's extremely important<br>
to apply yourself diligently, and sometimes, staying power is what<br>
delivers a big win. <br>
<p>
But ordinarily, you will find that trying harder produces only incremental<br>
gains, not quantum leaps. Also, keep in mind that sometimes trying harder<br>
(even a lot harder) offers little more than a straight path to burnout. <br>
Attempting to succeed through 'more of the same,' being resolute and<br>
relying on committed effort, can blind you to better pathways. <br>
<p>
If you want to make a quantum leap, quit thinking about trying harder. <br>
More effort isn't the answer. Get ruthless about trying something<br>
different?  Abandon the status quo. Change your behaviour. Look for a<br>
paradoxical move.  Ricochet? If you're trying to climb over the wall,<br>
open a door and walk through. If you're pushing against the river, try<br>
going with the flow.  Use finesse instead of effort. The tendency when<br>
you stall out or begin to level off in your performance is to go back to<br>
the basics and 'do what you do best.' But doing what you do best could be<br>
the worst thing you could do.<br>
<p>
Quantum leaps come when you seek the elegant solution.  So look for an<br>
approach characterized by simplicity, precision, effeciency and neatness. <br>
Call for a fresh perspective, a deft move, a path of less resistance. <br>
