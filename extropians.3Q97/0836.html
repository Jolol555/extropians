<p>
Could you please be more specific? What events have occurred in<br>
your forty years of experience in government that cause you to<br>
disagree with Perry's analysis? The four lines that you posted<br>
(after quoting *all* of Perry's post) have no content: they're a<br>
simple assertion of your experience without any details or evidence,<br>
and you might as well have forgone posting them at all for all the<br>
useful information they contain.<br>
<p>
Essentially you've informed all of us that you disagree with<br>
Perry, and that's all. Did you relly need to quote every single<br>
line of Perry's post to do that? Do you think that your<br>
informing us that you disagree with Perry did anything to<br>
improve the quality of information being presented to list<br>
subscribers?<br>
