<p>
I don't think it's neccecary to get violent on Eliezer here but I would<br>
like to make a point that the holocaust was not the first, not the last act<br>
of genocide that was perpetrated on our little planet. Just the best<br>
organized and documented one.<br>
<p>
A small selection of human achievement:<br>
<p>
It has already correctly been stated (IMHO) that Julius Ceasar murdered<br>
something like 2 million Gauls when during the 'Bello Galico' (the<br>
conquering of the aerea now known as France). Of course we will never know<br>
the exact number.<br>
Ceasar is still revered today by some people as a great leader and<br>
strategist, quiting him to make a point (Si vis Pacem, para bellum - If you<br>
want peace, be ready for war) is being dome on a regular basis.<br>
<p>
Ghengis Khan murdered about 40% of the global population of his time, in<br>
central Asian coutry's he still has almost divine status, people name their<br>
children after him and such.<br>
<p>
During the religious 30-year war in what is now Germany about half the<br>
peasant popuation was murdered by the warring upper classes in the name of<br>
God.<br>
<p>
Stalin not only allowed the russian army to be crushed by Hitler, wich<br>
killed about 20 million Russians. After the war he killed a further 20<br>
million that opposed him politically (or that he thought opposed him). For<br>
this he used some of the logistical experience that was aquired in Auswitz.<br>
<p>
Communist China has, since 1949, killed millions of its populace. Estimates<br>
range from 50 to more than 100 million (and none of these seem very<br>
unreasonable)<br>
<p>
Pol Pot did something similar in Cambodia, about 40% of the population was<br>
killed during 'pollitical re-education'<br>
<p>
After the Gulf War, the west (having secured their oil-supply) allowed the<br>
killing of an untold number of Kurds in northern Iraq.<br>
<p>
More recently, and for me closer to home, 250.000 people were killed<br>
(mostly civilians) in the former Yugoslavia (a lot in concentrationcamps).<br>
Europe (and the world) sat on their hands and did nothing for several<br>
years. It finally took American guns and decisivness to end all this.<br>
Repairing the damage done will take several generations. Meanwhile the ones<br>
responsible for all this are stil in power.<br>
<p>
Not long after that the UN did nothing to stop the planned genocide on<br>
about 500.000 Africans in Rwanda altough they had received warnings more<br>
than a year in advance from their own personell stationed there. The<br>
initiateers of this violence have never been caught (nobody has tried).<br>
<p>
What's next?<br>
<p>
Having seen what a civilan war and western indifferce can do to people with<br>
my own eyes I am strengtened in my belief that the only way to prevent this<br>
sort of thing happaning again and again is to 'be your bothers keeper'.<br>
If we do not fundamentally care for all our fellow humans nothing will<br>
change. Technology does not help here. We must actively care or accept<br>
large scale murder on a regular basis.<br>
<p>
But don't take my word for it, visit Chad, Somalia, Nigeria, Afghanistan,<br>
Cambodia, Ceylon, Birma and see for yourself (be sure to take a<br>
bullet-proof vest though).<br>
<p>
I firmly believe we *can* make a difference, and that we will.<br>
It will take directed effort and caring but I can tell you from personall<br>
experience that actually making a small differce for the better in matters<br>
like these will be the most profoundly satisfying experience any human can<br>
have.<br>
<p>
Let's do it!<br>
