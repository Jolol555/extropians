Just a few thoughts on Mark Crosby's post:<br>
<p>
Einstein's successful reduction of Newton's theory of gravitation<br>
as a "special case zone" within the predictions of relativity theory<br>
was mentioned as an example.  However, I suspect that present-day<br>
psychology is closer to Aristotle's physics than to Newton's.<br>
Newton's physical theories did not reduce much of Aristotle's theory,<br>
because he was building on the work of Galileo and Kepler and<br>
other anti-Aristotelean polemicists.  So I don't think this<br>
particular analogy offers much support to the reductive<br>
materialists.  But I can see how it would be convincing to<br>
someone who might have studied more present-day psychology than<br>
I have, and who thinks it's about as good as Newton's stuff;<br>
such a person might find this argument for reductive<br>
materialism convincing.<br>
<p>
Personally, I'm very interested in looking at some of the psychology<br>
and philosophy of Buddhist scholars, and this stuff is not as<br>
accessible to me (for various reasons) as the work of European<br>
scholars, so I haven't yet done much of it.  I do know there was<br>
at least one materialist school of philosophy within early Indian<br>
Buddhism, but I've forgotten the name.  The ethical focus of most<br>
Buddhist philosophy distracts from their insights into phenomenology<br>
(which I find more impressive than anything I've seen by the European<br>
school of phenomenology) and psychology, but I'd expect to find<br>
some good stuff there, if you care about theory and not just about<br>
what comes out of the lab.<br>
