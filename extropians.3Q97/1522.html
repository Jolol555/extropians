At this point the connection is less explicitly tactical than it is simply<br>
thematic.  Legalization of lesbian and gay marriages -- like the ongoing<br>
consolidation of reproductive freedoms, right to abortion and use of<br>
contraception -- has the effect of further unmooring desire from<br>
reproduction, linking modes of intimate association ever more<br>
conspicuously to the imperatives of self-expression and self-creation<br>
rather than to outdated imperatives concerning reproductive fitness<br>
presently governed by judeochrislamic ideologies and the medico-juridical<br>
discourses favored by State-sponsored bureaucrats over the last century or<br>
so.  It is no mistake that it is through the ongoing articulations of<br>
these rights to reproductive freedom that the Supreme Court is (*was*) <br>
slowly institutionalizing a Right to Privacy here in the United States. <br>
The fact that the clearest philosophical expression of this right to<br>
privacy is expressed in Justice Harry Blackmun's *dissent* in<br>
_Bowers_v._Hardwick_ (you know, the decision in which it was determined<br>
that States had the right to make sodomy illegal within their borders<br>
without the pesky whiff of unconstitutionality) is something that should<br>
concern *everybody* -- gay and straight alike.  Anyway, my guess is that<br>
once intimate association has been thoroughly disarticulated from<br>
reproduction by the trajectory of these shifts in legal imperatives and<br>
cultural mores (attitudes toward divorce, contraception, nonheterosexual<br>
marriages, etc.), then the culture will be better prepared to embrace an<br>
ever fuller range of modes of intimate association: polygamy, line<br>
marriage, etc. Best, Dale<br>
