A very interesting article in *21st Century Science &amp; Technology*, Spring 1997.<br>
"The Keplerian Harmony of Planets and Moons" speaks of an "ordering principle"<br>
bases on the barred spiral form of many galaxies. The author, Lothar Komp,<br>
has presented several diagrams with spirals fitted to major axes of various <br>
bodies, including the Solar System,<br>
and points out a great many resonances I was not aware of, e.g that <br>
Venus' day is locked to Earth's year. There is also a section on a relationship<br>
between the radius of a body and its period (!), <br>
The barred spiral may be considered a chaotic attractor.<br>
The theory deserves a closer inspection.<br>
