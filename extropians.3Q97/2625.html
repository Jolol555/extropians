<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So could the leading lab. </i><br>
<p>
The non-leading labs have a vital advantage: they will know at least the<br>
vague outlines of what works.  This will keep them from running down the<br>
multitude of blind alleys that are inevitable in pioneering technology.<br>
Consider the development of super-weapons during WWII: in say 1940, all the<br>
governmets involved faced the question of where to put their resources.  The<br>
Germans wasted vast efforts on ballistic missiles and rocket planes, while<br>
the British and Americans worked on A-bombs, radar, and cryptanalytic<br>
computers.  If the Germans had known which of these were going to pay off,<br>
the course of the war would have been different and far worse.  As soon as<br>
the Americans used their A-bombs, the Soviet Union started a development<br>
effort.  Even with their devastated economy and crazed government, they were<br>
able to catch up quickly, exactly because they knew where to put their efforts.<br>
<p>
Whoever gets some level of nanotech will have to exploit it to fund further<br>
development efforts.  Such exploitation will immediately provide valuable<br>
clues to everyone else in the world about which way to run.  While the<br>
leading lab is running down the next set of blind alleys, everyone else in<br>
the world will be catching up with them by the direct route.  (If you would<br>
care to claim that it is possible to profit from an advance in nanotech<br>
without providing valuable clues as to its nature, I would be happy to argue<br>
that in detail.)<br>
<p>
This is an absolutely standard scenario in the technological competition<br>
between companies.  Often the *second* company to manufacture a new product<br>
is the one that ends up dominating the market.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And it would be more attractive to </i><br>
<i>&gt;collaborate with the leading lab.</i><br>
<p>
So much the better for spreading the knowledge.<br>
