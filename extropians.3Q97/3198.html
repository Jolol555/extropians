<i>&gt;Even so, the unwarranted  reaction by Marr was surprising and disturbing. </i><br>
<p>
My reaction was warranted but exceptionally ill-judged, in that I should<br>
simply have written a polite email to Paul asking him if he was aware of<br>
his posts to the list. What saddens me most is that my ill judgement will<br>
necessarily, and deservedly lower my standing both on this list and with<br>
many of my dear friends.<br>
<p>
I can only repeat the apology to Paul which I posted last night, and say<br>
that I am considering unsubscribing from the list as the only other course<br>
of action open to me at this time. Perhaps it is, after all, that most<br>
human of traits, emotion, which will stop our breaking the boundaries which<br>
limit us at this time.<br>
