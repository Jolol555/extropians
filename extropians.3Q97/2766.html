I have now received strong suggestions, from two separate and distinct<br>
individuals, that the term "black goo" is prejudicial to persons reflecting<br>
certain spectra of light.  At least one of these persons did reflect those spectra<br>
and was personally offended.<br>
<p>
I therefore withdraw the term.<br>
<p>
I suggest the terms "war goo" or "death goo", depending on context.  "Khaki<br>
goo" and "red goo" are too confusing or ambiguous.  Also, since "black goo" no<br>
longer exists, "silver goo" goes too.  It is now "defense goo" or "'mune goo",<br>
again depending on context.<br>
<p>
----<br>
<p>
I defiantly retain my position that this is all bloody ridiculous.  I am still<br>
not convinced that this was the right thing to do.  I am not a fan of<br>
political correctness, which states that the use of certain terms may be<br>
forced.  Although I respect any person's right to reject a given term as<br>
prejudicial, I did not use the term "black goo" to refer to Human Reflectors<br>
Of The Certain Spectra.  The term was withdrawn on PR, rather than ethical,<br>
grounds.  I still feel that this would have been the best term to use for<br>
malevolent goo.  I only hope that my caving in has not condemned my entire<br>
generation to an agonizing death.<br>
<p>
I therefore ask:<br>
<p>
1.  Did it occur to *anyone* else that "black goo" was a racist term?<br>
<p>
2.  Why isn't "black ice" a racist term?<br>
<p>
3.  Is "red goo" offensive to Native Americans?<br>
