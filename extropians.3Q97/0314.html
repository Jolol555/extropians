Excellent post!  I would also add that when people whinge about<br>
'marketing' they forget that included in the price they pay is how much<br>
it cost the company to bring the product to their attention and make it<br>
easy to buy. In fact, when you hear those stories about the poor widdle<br>
company that had a great product but got beaten by the bastards that had<br>
better marketing, what is being blanked out is that, since advertising is<br>
part of the company's job and part of what you actually pay for, the<br>
poor widdle company was just crap at doing its job.<br>
<p>
i.e. the physical or conceptual item bought may have been ok, so the<br>
poor widdle company did half their job well, but they didn't do the<br>
other half very well: making it easy for you to buy it, so you knew it<br>
was available and easy to buy when you needed it.<br>
