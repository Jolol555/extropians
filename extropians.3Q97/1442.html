In a message dated 97-07-31 06:26:53 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 "Prejudice" as the media like to call it is often simple rational thinking.<br>
 The facts: the whole of central and southern Africa hasn't produced<br>
 an even remotely technolological "modern civilization". &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Then I must have some mis-information.  I was helping a young  black driver<br>
the other day...he was having problems understanding the concept of<br>
"axel-weight" vs "gross weight" , very confusing really....all those big<br>
numbers.  At any rate...during the course of the conversation he told me that<br>
during the "black studies" course in his high school he was taught about the<br>
ancient black civilizations of Africa which had electric airplanes...and many<br>
other (rather poorly defined) amazing and marvelous technological devices.<br>
 Of course somehow (unclear just how it happened) the white man stole it,<br>
along with mathematics which was perhaps why he was having such difficullties<br>
at the moment.<br>
<p>
You mean he was wrong?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Fact: they did</i><br>
 not even invent the wheel or bow and arrow. Unlike for example native<br>
 Americans they did not adapt when confronted by white (Boer) settlers<br>
 and were crushed (while the American natives were primarily defeated<br>
 by "alien" diseases like smallpox).   &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Now how can that be true?  I seem to recall that a certain Zulu Cheiftain had<br>
his warriors repeatedly charge a squad of Boers(or was it British?) armed<br>
with a Maxim Machine gun.  It seems that the machine gun had more bullets<br>
than the Chief had warriors and that tribe went extinct.  Most unfair...if<br>
he'd had only a few more young black males....and calling them stupid ?  Most<br>
unappreciative of the psycho-social dynamics I would think.<br>
<p>
Of course the Apache DID high-tail it at the mere sight of a Gatling Gun.<br>
 And then nail the suckers from ambush...but that was completely different.<br>
