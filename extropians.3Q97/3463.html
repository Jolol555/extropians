Some true answers:<br>
<p>
1.Psicho-induction by religions.......mainly.....<br>
2. Existencial disorientation and nobody to orient them....except the<br>
religious...( or, to those who can afford..., the psychologists....)<br>
(I'd mention the answer that a priest gave to me when I had, once, a serious<br>
accident :  I said innocently (when I was a believer): "Father, I have been<br>
afraid to dieing...." and he answered:  "What is the problem ??? The<br>
christian, whe dies, ressurrects..." And I got home psychologically worse<br>
than I was... Then I, with my surviving instinct not yet distroyed,  began<br>
to perceive the suicidal message of Jesus and the suicidal way followed by<br>
some "saints" ... You got it, folks????<br>
3. Reinforcing:  The suicidal message of some religions that if you are<br>
"good", if you die, will go to heaven...&gt;&gt; so....why not liking (and<br>
sometimes wishing...) to die...????<br>
