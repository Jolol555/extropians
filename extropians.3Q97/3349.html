<p>
Indeed, the present norms of world economic relationships will<br>
inevitably change beyond recognition as the Singularity approaches. And,<br>
yes, some collapse may indeed be inevitable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I want to add</i><br>
<i>&gt; further that unless we reach the Singularity as soon possible (as Eliezer</i><br>
<i>&gt; S. Yudkowsky suggests - see</i><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html#interim">http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/singularity.html#interim</a>), most of humanity, </i><br>
<i>&gt; including many on this list, will experience</i><br>
<i>&gt; enormous suffering and possibly death.  I give you a dialog:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 'Why?!" you may ask.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because Free-Market Economics is GOOD for COMPANIES (fictitious legal</i><br>
<i>&gt; entities and BAD for PEOPLE (very real entities).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 'How can you say that?!  The economy is doing great, the stock market</i><br>
<i>&gt; is at an all-time high, unemployment is at a 30yr low, inflation is low,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and corporate profits are up!'</i><br>
<p>
People are stockholders in corporations. As corporations do well, so do<br>
their stockholders.<br>
<p>
&lt;SNIP SOME STUFF&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; 'Not at all.  I happen to be one of those cyber-geeks!  But unlike</i><br>
<i>&gt; many of my fellow colleagues, I have a conscience and a heart.  I care</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the 80% or humanity I am obsoleting with each line of code I write.</i><br>
<p>
You're funny. You care about the people you are obsoleting? Stake your<br>
claim now, the moral high ground is disappearing fast! But you don't<br>
care that much, right? Or else, you wouldn't be doing it, would you? I<br>
think a social conscience is just that, a social conscience. It has zero<br>
praxis. Its easy to feel bad about "plights." What is your guilt<br>
accomplishing? Zippo. <br>
<p>
Try again, I'm sympathetic but totally unpersuaded. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have perused the extro list for over 2 years now, and I have yet to</i><br>
<i>&gt; hear any reasonable talk about compassion or building livingry for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; majority o humanity that is becoming increasingly unnecessary in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; free-market.  If you don't care extropians, I hope you can bury your conscience</i><br>
<i>&gt; as you watch the rest of humanity languish to death while you ride your</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropic vehicles to the stars.</i><br>
<p>
Again, the fact that you *DO* care about the majority of humanity is<br>
useless. And who said extropy was a secret? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In closing I would like to say that when people are no longer needed</i><br>
<i>&gt; for a free-market economy, then a free-market economy is no longer needed</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the people.</i><br>
<p>
Huh? That's a nice way to close, but it doesn't seem to follow from your<br>
earlier premises. <br>
<p>
"When people are no longer needed for a free-market economy": People are<br>
needed for the most basic and important function there is in a<br>
free-market -- collecting the profits. <br>
<p>
Free-market not needed by the people? What is your alternative? I mean<br>
there's pure communalism, pure capitalism and all the fuzzy gradations<br>
in between. Take your pick. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  So the question then becomes, whats beyond the</i><br>
<i>&gt; free-market?  Any ideas?</i><br>
<p>
Everything owned by one entity S. Humans may or may not be in the<br>
picture.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't think of any with out getting bogged down into some silly</i><br>
<i>&gt; left-winged drivel.  Peronally, I hope we get to the singularity soon,</i><br>
<i>&gt; otherwise we may all drown in our own free-market success.  Except of course</i><br>
<i>&gt; for you savvy extropians!</i><br>
<p>
You might want to consider that the Singularity, while inevitable, is<br>
not necessarily the answer to your concerns. <br>
<p>

<i>&gt; Holly Pearson</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; P.S.  So, are you an extro-nazi or an extro-saint?</i><br>
<p>
Holly, you must have missed my earlier post (actually, this morning), on<br>
Godwin's Law of Nazi Apologies. What little credibility you might've had<br>
just went out the window in my eyes. But I'll post this anyway.<br>
