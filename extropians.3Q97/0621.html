     The question was posed:<br>
     <br>
<i>     &gt;Besides, isn't (sic) savannahs (or coastal areas if you believe in </i><br>
     the aquatic ape theory) very poor in natural psychedelics? How would<br>
<i>     &gt;McKenna explain that?</i><br>
<i>     &gt;</i><br>
     <br>
     Guru George responded:<br>
     <br>
     He goes into this question in the book.  Again, I can't<br>
     remember the details, I'm sorry - it's a while since I read the book.<br>
     <br>
     Rick elaborates:<br>
     <br>
     McKenna is out there but after reading him, hearing him and observing <br>
     him, he's definitely onto something.  That being that our pre-human <br>
     ancestors came down from the trees, likely for environmental reasons, <br>
     into the savannahs where the plains roaming herd were depositing their <br>
     faces all over the place.  The tropical variety of psychedlelic <br>
     mushroom is very brightly colored (red cap with white spots---Alice <br>
     was quite taken with them).<br>
     <br>
     In low consumption, senses are heightened, visual accuity increases <br>
     and you can hear and taste everything much more profoundly (personal <br>
     experience attests to this).  These doses would've increased the early <br>
     hominid's hunting success since even night vision is increased.  A <br>
     little higher dose and your libido is ready to rock and roll, <br>
     increasing the possibility for conception for the otherwise <br>
     survival-centric apes.  The wacky-tabacky dose (5 grams I understand) <br>
     puts you into shamanic realms where you have the opportunity to <br>
     connect with the other (the overtly pragmatic reader requiring <br>
     empirical evidence may substitute "other" for unique <br>
     chemically-induced hallucination).<br>
     <br>
     McKenna makes a few quite notable suggestions:  that psylocibin was an <br>
     evolutionary agent in hominid advancement.  He also promotes a <br>
     measurable wave in novelty occurring for our species that is fast <br>
     approaching it's apex.  He is like a cross between Leary and Huxley, <br>
     very glib, very well read, very eccentric and hangin' very chummy with <br>
     some of the big boys like Rupert Sheldrake (whose theories on <br>
     morphogenic fields are quite intriguing as well).  I dropped <br>
     Sheldrake's name just in case a few of you were going into <br>
     metaphysical tilt (heaven forbid I get flamed for bringing up what <br>
     someone would perceive as Enquirer-caliber material &lt;G&gt;).<br>
     <br>
     I hope this information prompts two conversations: the role of <br>
     psychedelics in advancing consciousness (because I feel it has <br>
     advanced mine) and the seemingly exponential increase in novelty in <br>
     modern times.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
