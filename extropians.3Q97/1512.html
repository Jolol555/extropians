<i>&gt; This is really neat! One of the biggest advantages of Java is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the user doesn't have to do anything to download the code.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You just bring up the web page and your browser does the rest.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you have a Java-capable browser (Netscape 3.01 or IE 3?), you</i><br>
<i>&gt; should REALLY try this. Please note that it's still a sophisticated</i><br>
<i>&gt; graphics program, and therefore it is big enough to take a while to</i><br>
<i>&gt; download (20 seconds at 64kbps) and will run better on a faster</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer.</i><br>
<p>
This is indeed a very cool program, and the Java interface works great.<br>
The big problem though is that you can't save your work (Java applets<br>
can't save to disk with current versions of Netscape and IE).<br>
<p>
At first I thought it was just a simple drawing program, then I realized<br>
that the energy minimization buttons would actually move the atoms around<br>
until the atom positions and bond angles were realistic.<br>
<p>
I entered a couple of simple structures from Nanosystems (the rod in<br>
figure 9.5a and a modified form of the bond bearing in 10.1).  The<br>
energy minimization functions worked pretty well, but things did not<br>
come out quite right.  I am no chemist, but I could see that some of the<br>
atomic arrangements were not as symmetric as they should be.  So there<br>
are probably still some bugs in the software.<br>
