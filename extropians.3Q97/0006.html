"In many fairy tales the intrepid hero slays dragons, battles giants and<br>
 monsters, witches and sorcerers.  Eventually the intelligent child<br>
 begins to wonder what these heroes are out to prove." --Bruno Bettelheim<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
Bruno Bettelheim used to get his jollies by instructing the young girls <br>
under his his custody and control to undress and take a shower.<br>
<p>
When they came out og the showers, naked and glistening wet, he would put <br>
them over his lap and 'spank' them in front of all the inmates.<br>
<p>
Many of the young girls were very brave, and tried so hard not to cry.<br>
<p>
What they didn't realize is that he would go on 'spanking' them until they <br>
_did_ cry.<br>
<p>
<p>
It's worthwhile finding out if -- on occasion -- he went on 'spanking' <br>
them until thy _stopped_ crying, because they had broken psychologically, <br>
and had given up on any hope of rescue...<br>

<p>
Now we can advance to a further level of understanding:<br>
<p>
Take two texts:<br>
<p>
'The Joy of Sex' by Alex Comfort;<br>
<p>
'The Little Fascist' from 'What do you say after you say "Hello?" by Eric <br>
Berne. Interestingly, this chapter is omitted from the Collected Work...<br>
<p>
Next, read * scrupulously * the illustrated literature on the <br>
demonstration killing of JonBenet Ramsey.<br>
<p>
Then advance to this next posting:<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;:-) Mick Dyer (NB the smiley, its a genuine question.....)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
OK.<br>
<p>
This is not a 'popular' case to argue (civil liberties seldom are).<br>
<p>
There's an academic study, 'Child Loving' written by (ISTR) William <br>
Kinkaid [publ. RKP]  which I haven't read.<br>
<p>
Let's look at that seriously.<br>
<p>
Firstly, at a methodological level:  (Pardon my French!)<br>
<p>
<p>
Following logician Alfred Tarski, we can say:<br>
<p>
"The statement 'Les pedophiles sont particulierement dangereuse aux les <br>
membres de public' is thrue if -- and only if - paedophiles are, in fact, <br>
particularly dangerous to members of the public."   Ironically, such <br>
relationships are known in France as 'Special friendships.'  There's a <br>
novel of that name, by Roger de Peyrefitte, which is on this topic.  No <br>
sex in it, BTW.<br>
<p>
<p>
We do not have a good statistical basis for knowing how many members of <br>
the population are 'paedophiles.'  The American Academic Hypertext <br>
Encyclopaedia by Grolier [1993] describes people who find pre-pubescent <br>
children sexually attractive.  But consider: such preferences are not <br>
binary.  They range from people being completely erotically indifferent to <br>
pre-pubescent children, through to finding them (or some of them -- but <br>
which? One?  All of them?) sexually _irresistable_.<br>
<p>
<p>
Sexual attraction can only properly apply to a reproductive context. So <br>
we're not dealing with sexuality at all -- pre-pubescent girls cannot <br>
reproduce, and boys and men cannot reproduce at all, except with fertile <br>
females.<br>
<p>
So we're really considering unilateral eroticism -- an internally <br>
experienced erotic attraction, which ranges from (say) zero to a hundred <br>
percent -- we have no _metric_ for it, anyway -- and reciprocated erotic <br>
interactions - an exchange of intellectual and sensory experience.<br>
<p>
But erotic feelings are internally-experienced 'World II' phenomena -- <br>
again, there is no external metric.  And they can therefore have _no <br>
impact whatsoever on other people_ (except insofar as other people can <br>
sense them at some tacit level).<br>
<p>
Insofar as pre-pubescent children actually have no capacity -- knowledge and <br>
experience -- of and for for erotic arousal, they can hardly either sense <br>
it in other people, or understand it either.<br>
<p>
So we just don't know.  The positivist assertion must therefore be false.<br>
<p>
But is it objectively true, all unbeknownst to us?<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
Cut to the chase.<br>
<p>
<p>
People are understandably very concerned about strangers who forcibly <br>
inflict unwanted physical assaults (of varying degrees of severity) on <br>
children who never sought out such behaviour.  But this is very rare -- in <br>
the case of grave genital or anal assaults.  <br>
<p>
Insofar as grave physical abuse by strangers _does_ occur, it <br>
predominantly occurs in situations where the children are deprived of <br>
liberty -- i.e. in childrens' 'homes' and schools.  There is much <br>
empirical evidence for this.  Vastly more grave assaults on children <br>
(genital and/or anal) occur at the hands of their parents, in the home: <br>
people who have 'legitimate' power over them.<br>
<p>
In almost all cases, these assaults can actually be completely prevented <br>
and stopped, and children need no longer suffer, or -- like Jonbenet Ramsey, <br>
aged 6, be hideously tortured and then murdered.<br>
<p>
[ Either one or other of her parents killed her, or -- vastly more <br>
probable -- it was a carefully planned and executed 'demonstration' <br>
killing, carried out by paid psychopaths.  The investigating authorities <br>
are not making it very easy to discover the facts in this matter].  Time <br>
will tell.<br>
<p>
Asking 'What powerful and unpleasant people has John Ramsey upset?' might <br>
prove a fruitful line of inquiry.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
        The real-world solution is simple:  equip all children with <br>
personalized miniature radio 'search-and-rescue' beacons, activated _by <br>
them_ in crisis situations and emitting a personalized radio alarm signal, <br>
 This can be instantly picked up, the source location triangulated and <br>
given Global Positioning Coordinates, and appropriate rescue services sent <br>
to the scene immediately, by the fastest possible means.<br>
<p>
        The small units can be worn as pendants, bracelets, on a belt.  <br>
Anywhere accessible to the child should they be in a crisis situation.  <br>
Training children to use them is simple. They're very cheap to manufacture. <br>
Come to think of it, we could all do with these -- it results in <br>
incident-driven policing at the behest of the person under threat. This <br>
would be most fruitful in reconfiguring policing to be a system of <br>
delegated self-defence, rather than a means of social control operated by <br>
the governing hierarchical authorities.<br>
<p>
Microlert was offering such a service for US $30 a year in California, in <br>
the Seventies.  <br>
<p>
Advocates of authoritarian and violent parenting and schooling (Gillick, <br>
Howard, Shephard, Feulner) _hate and detest_ this sort of idea, which is <br>
now actually being made available to children under threat within their <br>
homes, in America...<br>
<p>
Ask yourself why it is, that the 'authorities' seem to have so little <br>
concern for the phyical, psychological and emotional well-being of each <br>
and every one of us -- children _and_ adults.<br>
<p>
The exaggerated 'AIDS' propaganda backfired on the 'moral' authoritarians, <br>
resulting in a vast proliferation of erotic non-penetrative activity -- <br>
so-called 'safe sex.'<br>
<p>
The social-control freaks are _really pissed off_ about this failure.  A  <br>
lot of effort and resources went into the scare.<br>
<p>
Stuff called BHT (E321) -- a near-perfectly-safe food preservative and <br>
anti-oxidant -- zaps all lipid-coated viruses it's so far been tesed on, <br>
in 250 mg. oral daily doses. No side-effects, no immunocompromize effects.<br>
<p>
It's generic, and sells for around five bucks a kilo.<br>
<p>
Do a WWW search on 'Fowkes' and 'BHT'<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
The idea of children remaining 'innocent' in the context of modern <br>
tobacco, confectionery and newspaper shops is quite risible, insofar as <br>
there are all that many children incapable of erotic responses left. Go <br>
look at the magazine racks in any shop. Just look at the cover pictures <br>
and text.<br>
<p>
        Orchestrated witch-hunts against mostly harmless and inoffensive <br>
people is much nearer what the 'authorities seem to want to go in for.  <br>
Coercion. Wonder why?<br>
<p>
No civil libertarian should have much of a problem answering that: -- <br>

<p>

<p>
                       MORE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
I'm hardly any kind of  'paedophile' -- my idea of 'attractive' is the <br>
glorious Olivia Newton-John.  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
But I did see my best friend lying in a mortuary, with ice crystals on his <br>
face, stone dead.  He liked emotional involvemet with -- and on occasion <br>
mutual erotic play with -- good-looking boys between the ages of twelve <br>
and fourteen.  They seemed to welcome it, AFAIK.  If I'd had any reason to <br>
think that they didn't, he wouldn't have been a friend of mine for a <br>
moment longer.<br>
<p>
<p>
With me was another good friend with similar inclinations.  He went on to <br>
become a top Royal Navy carrier pilot and a gifted 'TOP GUN' air combat <br>
trainer.  He trained to fly one-way nuclear mission against the USSR -- <br>
which would have killed and maimed millions of people, had he been ordered <br>
to do it.  Quite futile, too -- when someone asked 'but we haven't the <br>
fuel capacity to get back, they were told: "What do you think will be left <br>
here to get back to?"<br>
<p>
He ceased to have any interest in younger boys as he grew older, but is <br>
still an 'out' gay in Oz.<br>
<p>
<p>
I have no reason to think that either of them ever did any kind of harm to <br>
anyone.  I don't have friends who are like that.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
One of the parents resented their son's attachment to my best friend, and <br>
'sweated' a 'confession' out of their son... The police were summoned, <br>
and very commendably seemed suprisingly unconcerned, and he was charged <br>
with 'indecent exposure', ISTR.  However, they told him he couldn't expect <br>
to go on 'doing it.'<br>
<p>
All too true.<br>
<p>
<p>
A little later, he was found dead by his mother and sister.<br>

If JonBenet Ramsey were to return, what would she do?<br>
<p>
She knows who killed her, and the sort of people they are.<br>
<p>
Imagine that she -- and those close to her -- are  Jedi Knights.<br>
<p>
Perhaps she'd do a personality pattern matching analysis.<br>
<p>
Children are very skilled at this.<br>
<p>
Imagine she comes to such people in their dreams, and reiteratively <br>
seduces them, tortures them, and is tortured to death by them.<br>
<p>
Then she starts all over again...<br>

Here's Eric Berne, on 'The Little Fascist':<br>
<p>
"Every human being seems to have a little fascist in their head. This is <br>
derived from the deepest layers of the personality...<br>
<p>
<p>
"A fascist may be defined as a person who has no respect for living tissue, <br>
and regards it as his prey...<br>
<p>
"It became less impotant to kill him (or her) than to hear or watch him (or <br>
her) scream and grovel.  This became the essence of fascism -- a roving <br>
band seeking male or female pey to torment or deride -- whose art lay in <br>
probing for the victim's weaknesses...<br>
<p>
"There are two by-products of the grovel, both of them advantageous to the <br>
aggressor.  The biological effect is pleasure and excitement, with the <br>
victim available to indulge even the most ingenious perversions, the <br>
favorite of record being anal rape...<br>
<p>
"Torture brings about a peculiar intimacy between the torturer and the <br>
victim, and a profound insight into each others souls, an intimacy <br>
otherwise lacking in both their lives...<br>
<p>
"The other by-product is a purely [?] commercial one...<br>
<p>
"Compare: '800 of their soldiers by my arms I destroyed: their populace in <br>
the flames I burned: their boys, their maidens I dishonoured.  1000 of <br>
their warriors' corpses on a hill I piled up. On the first of May, I <br>
killed 800 of their fighting men, I burned their many houses, their boys <br>
and maidens I dishonored... etc.. (From the Annals of Assur-Nasir-pal, <br>
Column II, about 870 BCE).<br>

POSTSCRIPT:<br>
<p>
Admiral Noel A. M. Gayler designed SIOP, the Single Integrated Oprational  <br>
Plan, America's global nuclear warfighting strategy.  He now campaigns for <br>
the global abolition of nuclear weapons and a reduction in military forces <br>
down to police levels. (Ref: Kaplan et. al., "The Wizards of Armageddon").<br>
<p>
<p>
I know Admiral Gayler a little:<br>
<p>
After speaking with him at his home in Alexandria ( the Pentagon's  Flag <br>
Officers' Desk gave me his home address), I sent him a preliminary outline <br>
of an alternative Twelve Track Parallel Plan to achieve a world of free, <br>
peaceful and prosperous individuals, being themselves and living their own <br>
lives in a world with the absolute minimum of necessary violence.<br>
<p>
With the paper, I enclosed a copy of Bryan Magee's crystalline short <br>
introduction to Karl Popper's work. I knew he'd like it  -- We're <br>
Kantians.<br>
<p>
I was so disappointed when he never responded.<br>
<p>
Still, the other day I followed my friend Mac's advice, stuck in a <br>
prominent position on his Navy twin-jet fighter's instrument panel:<br>
<p>
[ FX: "NEVER  ASSUME --- CHECK!!!" ]<br>
<p>
So I called the Admiral.<br>
<p>
He was most surprised -- my mailing had never arrived...<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
AFAIK, SIOP had elements of 'fail-deadly' launch procedures.<br>
<p>
If communications were cut, launch procedures initiated 'automatically.'<br>
<p>
In my plan, there are fail-safe procedures and error-checking.<br>
<p>
For all we know, BOTH of these Plans are active.<br>
<p>
Insofar as this may be so, we all may hope that mine 'gets there' first.<br>
