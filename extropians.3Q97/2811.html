Not so tried and true.  Recently I read Freeman Dyson's _Weapons and<br>
Hope_.  According to him, the US claimed to be operating under MAD --<br>
"launch nukes at us and we blow both of us up."  Doomsday deterrence.<br>
Otherwise known as "in case of fire, kill lots of Russians."<br>
<p>
The Soviets thought this was immoral and insane.  Their policy was<br>
'counterforce' -- "show us that you're willing to use any nuke and we'll<br>
do our best to wipe out your arsenal."  "In case of fire, do our best to<br>
survive."<br>
<p>
NATO disavored "first strike" -- initiating use of strategic weapons --<br>
but had (has?) official plans allowing "first use", the use of tactical<br>
nukes to deter a conventional invasion of Europe.  The Soviets disavowed<br>
"first use" but allowed themselves "first strike."  So they could have<br>
invaded Europe, which would have caused us to use tactical nukes (our<br>
strategy for saving money on tanks) which would have used them to use<br>
strategics to try to wipe out our missiles (because we'd used nuclear<br>
wepoans near their territory) which would have caused us to use<br>
strategics to wipe out their cities (because they were using strategics)<br>
which would have killed everything.<br>
<p>
English having a larger vocabulary than other languages, Dyson claims<br>
that the subtleties of our "deterrence" collapse to "intimidation" in<br>
Russian.<br>
<p>
I liked Dyson's arguments for a "live-and-let-live" strategy, otherwise<br>
known as "tit-for-tat".  If someone uses nukes against us, use similar<br>
amounts in response.  Also work on terminal phase defense systmes to<br>
defend our cities from incoming missiles.  (Not to be confused with the<br>
boost-phase defenses of the "Star Wars" program, which was silly.)<br>
<p>
I'm not sure what the relevance of all this for nano is yet, but I<br>
figured I'd spread some Dysonism.<br>
