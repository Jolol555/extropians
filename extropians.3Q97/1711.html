den Otter &lt;otter@globalxs.nl&gt; had some great comments and asked:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Pps: question for the audience: HOW FAR WOULD *YOU* GO TO SAVE A</i><br>
<i>&gt; RELUCTANT LOVED ONE?</i><br>
<p>
	I'm only in the process of getting signed up.  Once I do get<br>
signed up and have necessary funds allocated, I plan on working on<br>
allocating some funds for just such a purpose.  When asking reluctant<br>
friends and family about it I often ask them if they would accept it<br>
if it was paid for by someone else or given to them for free.  Hopping<br>
that they read between the lines and see that I'm more or less asking<br>
them if they would accept it if I payed for it.<br>
<p>
	I think it should be like government provided paramedics at<br>
the scene of an accident.  The default is, they try to save your life.<br>
But of course it is always possible to decline their treatment with an<br>
exceptional specific request.  If I could afford it for everyone, I<br>
would pay for it all.  It's just unfortunate that such funds obviously<br>
compete with money that should be additionally donated to perform<br>
critically necessary research...<br>
<p>
	Look at the Mormons when they go to great lengths and efforts<br>
to perform "necessary" ordinances for ALL the dead! ;) The default is,<br>
you have the exaltation enabling ordinances for the dead performed,<br>
unless someone exceptionally and specifically request otherwise.  As<br>
in the case when certain Jews have complained about Mormons doing<br>
temple ordinances and keeping records for Jews killed in the<br>
Holocust... ;)<br>
