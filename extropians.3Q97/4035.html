Hi!<br>

Thanks for all your replies,<br>

Why has civilization lasted? IMHO, because there are laws, there is a<br>
judicial system to prevent anarchy, in anarchy everyone would do what<br>
they want and that would surely mean the destruction of mankind.<br>
Civilization doesn't exist because we are good but because institutions<br>
and persons work very hard at controlling the masses.<br>

Particullary men are violent, human beings are naturally selfish.<br>
Education is, IMHO, what makes persons 'look better' than they are.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hardly necessarily.  Alongside economies of scale are prices of scale.</i><br>
<i>&gt; An insect can get its oxygen through simple diffusion.  Big things like</i><br>
<i>&gt; us need hearts and blood vessels to move oxygen and food around.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; large corporation needs be more complex, and thus has slower response</i><br>
<i>&gt; times, and administrative costs, etc.  It works well for mass producing</i><br>
<i>&gt; standard products, poorly for high quality specialty goods.  Thus the</i><br>
<i>&gt; failure of supermarkets to drive out all the small bread and cheese</i><br>
<i>&gt; stores in a well-off city.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "united we fall, when we make one dumb mistake which effects us all [see</i><br>
<i>&gt; China]; divided we grow, as diversity explores many different ways of</i><br>
<i>&gt; doing something, and keeps the effects of mistakes localized, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; preserves healthy areas which can regenerate the loss."</i><br>
<p>
What if some corporation doesn't make enough mistakes to fall, it will<br>
eventualy take control of the market and then we will all suffer. In a<br>
free-market, there will be the ones who are better than other at their<br>
business, what if this persons are a lot better? They'll control<br>
everything in their area.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; } Besides, many persons are also selfish and greedy. The consumer, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; } common citizen doesn't know and doesn't care about environmental issues.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, that explains why the Western world rose up and banned CFCs.  Must</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been those nasty Freon producing corporations who told their</i><br>
<i>&gt; owned governments to...</i><br>
<p>
DuPont, one, if not the, largest producer of CFCs had knowledge of the<br>
destructive effects of CFCs on the ozone but prevented this from being<br>
known. There are several sources claiming this. Obviously, if they knew,<br>
others would too, they just weren't paid attention. Only when persons<br>
started to die did the governments do something.<br>
It remaind's me of the mad cow disease, with the information available<br>
in the 80s it should had been taken measures to prevent people from<br>
eating cows and yet it continued because economical pressures were more<br>
important than the thousands that might (we don't know for sure) die<br>
from the human form of the disease.<br>
Governments are owned by corporations, of course that when people start<br>
dyeing, action is taken or else no government or even corporation<br>
resists .<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The free market of cities has done more, over time, to turn poor people</i><br>
<i>&gt; into well-off middle class citizen than anything else.  The Church did</i><br>
<i>&gt; not raise the poor.  Welfare has not raised the poor.  Communism -- many</i><br>
<i>&gt; attempts -- did not raise the poor.  It was the burgs which created the</i><br>
<i>&gt; bourgeois, who'd once been poor.  All, of course, have had some sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt; law-and-order government.</i><br>
<p>
The free market of cities in America has also created many poor people.<br>
Violence in America is the proof of this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; } ask you something, do you think that the poorer classes generated by</i><br>
<i>&gt; } free-markets will stand still? My bet is that they'll riot and that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Poverty has no causes!  Only prosperity has causes.  Poverty and</i><br>
<i>&gt; ignorance are the natural state of humanity, which we work to rise</i><br>
<i>&gt; above.  The market does not generate poor people; it generates poor</i><br>
<i>&gt; classes only insofar as it generates rich classes, creating a contrast</i><br>
<i>&gt; with those who have not risen as far.</i><br>
<p>
Then why shouldn't we build condition so that all can prosper and not<br>
just a few. It's not a communist ideology, it's a matter of assuring<br>
basic conditions to everyone, from that to be wealthy is up to them but<br>
let's at least assure some basic conditions.<br>

<p>
That's an interesting point, it remaind's me of an article in my site<br>
called "The Selfish Genius", the conclusions are roughly the same.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; I'll be honest, I don't know what negative feedback is and I know</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; nothing of basic economics but I always knew that "united we stand,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; divided we fall". If a corporation starts achieving a substantial</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; advantage towards everyone else, as it grows, it will eventually</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; become more efficient, more capable, will be able to have the most</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; competitive prices and therefore, will achieve a monopoly status.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Right? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No.  Economies of scale don't automatically apply in every</i><br>
<i>&gt; industry, and there is usually a "diminishing returns" effect.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Monopolies are almost invariably the result of regulators</i><br>
<i>&gt; imposing barriers to entry in the market upon potential new</i><br>
<i>&gt; competitors.  Sometimes this is done explicitly, as with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; PTTs and many country's power industries, sometimes it is done</i><br>
<i>&gt; in a more hidden manner, as with the banking industries, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A market in which the two or three leaders have 60% to 80%</i><br>
<i>&gt; market share is not a monopoly.  A PTT, on the other hand, is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; real monopoly, with all the insidious effects thereof.</i><br>
<p>
If a corporation reaches monopoly in a no-rules world, it won't lose<br>
easily and we will all suffer. A corporation with a monopoly status will<br>
have the better research facilities, the better marketing experts, it<br>
will even have the best criminals to take care of their opposition! It<br>
will become unstopable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; (I see that in Portugal every time, small shops complaining about</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; big commercial centers and supermarkets)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, but which do the customers complain about?  Businesses</i><br>
<i>&gt; exist to serve consumers, not the other way around.</i><br>
<p>
But if small shops go broke, the supermarkets will be able to put the<br>
prices they want and therefore harming everybody.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Since unselfish reasons rarely incentives anyone to do anything,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; let me ask you something, do you think that the poorer classes</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; generated by free-markets will stand still? My bet is that they'll</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; riot and that is what I fear.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The poorer clases are not generated by free markets, the poorer</i><br>
<i>&gt; classes are generated by oppressive taxation and regulation</i><br>
<i>&gt; which hinders the market from providing them with goods, jobs,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and services.</i><br>
<p>
The rules and regulations prevent the market from employing people? I<br>
can't believe that.<br>

<p>
US citizens are the most generous of their time? I'm sorry to be<br>
skeptical but can you prove it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So it was the threat to their very lives? I dunno, we in the US have</i><br>

<i>&gt; EXAMPLES: Recycling, Dolphin Safe Tuna, BGH free milk (which is opposed</i><br>

<p>
Market pressure or public relations. A corporation makes a positive<br>
environmental thing, gives it a lot of publicity and then goes on<br>
destroying the environment but since it did a good thing, it can argue<br>
with that to continue the destruction of the environment.<br>
That's not market preassure, that's cheating on the citizens (I'm<br>
generally speaking).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; You talk about how the market will control big corporations and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; millions of consumers will lead the market into the best path, let me</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ask you something, why is government so corrupt? People theoretically</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; control government (by voting) and still government is corrupt, why is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that? What makes you think that indirect control of economy by persons</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is going to improve anything?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because government concentrates power in the hands of the few,</i><br>
<i>&gt; corrupting the powerful rapidly, while indirect control dilutes power</i><br>
<i>&gt; into digestible, uncorruptible bite sizes for everyone.</i><br>
<p>
Indirect control dilutes the power? Indirect control will make the most<br>
welthy persons have all the power and do what they want for the harm of<br>
consummers and general population.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; I read books, I find it, however, much less boring and time consuming to</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; a question?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes I do, usually 3-6 books a week.</i><br>
<p>
6 books a week? Can you give me an autograph or let me take a picture<br>
with you? Pretty amazing.<br>
<p>
One last thing, extropy is the opposite of entropy. Our goal is to fight<br>
entropy or disorder and yet you defend complete disorder in the economy.<br>
