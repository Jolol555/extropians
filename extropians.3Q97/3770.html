I found Jane Jacobs' take on ethics, presented in _Systems of Survival_<br>
rather interesting.  I may have gone on about this before, but the list<br>
archives are stalling on me, so you get to read or delete me again.  I<br>
reply to three older posts further down, though.<br>
<p>
She argues that if you look around in history you will find two common<br>
sets of ethical systems, both of which have been quite successful at<br>
different times. (Thus the title.)  One is "trader" or "producer"<br>
morality, the commerical syndrome: shun force; value honesty, diligence,<br>
dissent for the sake of the task, competition; have an optimistic view<br>
of the future; honor contracts.  The other is "raider", "guardian", or<br>
military morality: shun trading; value loyalty, prowess, distribution of<br>
largesse, deceit for the sake of the task; be territorial, be<br>
fatalistic.  (This is from memory; her lists were longer.)<br>
<p>
The commerical syndrome (a set of concurrent things that usually form an<br>
identifiable pattern) have much history attesting to its superior<br>
productivity.  The military syndrome has a lot of history attesting to<br>
its superior survival skill, especially against other militaries.<br>
<p>
Jacobs argues that both are necessary, but that they must be kept<br>
separate.  If you start mixing and matching items from the lists you get<br>
a self-reinforcing disaster.  Traditionally the solution has been caste<br>
or class systems.  India is the most famous, but China and Japan had<br>
four strata of occupations; they differed as to whether scholars or<br>
warriors were on top, but merchants were beneath the farmers.  Europe<br>
had a three-estate system: priests, nobles, everyone else; nobles do the<br>
fighting.  <br>
<p>
This works fine at first, but if society changes the system probably<br>
won't fit.  The West is trying separation by individual flexibility:<br>
trusting that people in guardian roles (soldiers, politicians, lawyers<br>
some of the time) will behave according to that role.<br>
<p>
My anarchist impulse upon reading the book was to wonder whether private<br>
law systems couldn't subsume guardian functions into producer life.  If<br>
guardian functions require guardian morality then that bodes ill for<br>
PPLs; they'll simply turn into the Mob or warlords.<br>
<p>
If anyone has heard of the Ik, by the way, she argues that their<br>
collapse was because they were hunters -- raiders -- forced to live as<br>
farmers -- which calls for trader morality, which they didn't have.<br>
Societal collapse promptly followed.<br>

Depends what you mean by libertarianism.  Anarchist versions are more or<br>
less untested.  Minarchist ones look good -- Hong Kong under the Brits;<br>
the happy days of the Roman Republic and Empire, from what I know.<br>

 <br>
Perhaps we changed.  Jacobs argues that Southern slaveowners fit well<br>
in the guardian/raider mold (I forget if she felt they were contaminated<br>
by some commerical elements.)  Slaveowning is dandy there.  The North<br>
was presumably moving toward commerical morality; that may have caused<br>
them to start caring more about nearby humanoid beings, even if they<br>
still didn't want blacks to marry their daughters.<br>

I agree.  Human nature can be a nasty thing.  Jacobs argues that the<br>
"shun trading" of raiders (warrior contempt for merchants was common to<br>
Western chivalry and Japanese bushido) was the simplest way to keep your<br>
warriors from considering selling secrets or gatekeys to the enemy for<br>
their own gain.  Similarly, the benefits of a straight ban on<br>
non-defensive force may far outweigh the gains of group eugenics, when<br>
the latter could lead to further contempt for individual life or<br>
choice.<br>
<p>
Selecting for intelligence wouldn't make people any nicer, and there'd<br>
be an open door saying that it was okay to do nasty things to masses of<br>
people for some purposes... so why not others?<br>
<p>
This applies to Eliezer's coca virus as well.  Releasing viruses to<br>
"solve" the problem of crack neighborhoods -- whose misery is caused<br>
first by socioeconomic factors -- is not a good precedent.<br>
