<i>&gt; All I've heard and read of uploading concentrates on taking an intact</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain and "reading it" to another substarate, a non-trivial task by any</i><br>
<i>&gt; measure.  Instead of this approach, how about using a biological brain</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a scaffolding upon which to build an "uploaded" personna.  After</i><br>
<i>&gt; extensive and successive augmentation, the grey matter will matter less</i><br>
<i>&gt; and less. The personna of such a being will begin to spred out of the skull</i><br>
<i>&gt; and into the hardware/software, so eventually the wet stuff will not</i><br>
<i>&gt; do anything that isn't done by the hardware/sotfware.  Take that brain to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the recycle bin-- or what the hell, sell it!  Maybe use it as the seed for</i><br>
<i>&gt; another version of you...  What would you do with your brain if you no</i><br>
<i>&gt; longer needed it? </i><br>

Yes, it has already been discussed (great minds often think alike),<br>
it is commonly called gradual uploading. Many of us think this is the<br>
most likely form of uploading (although getting rid of the biological<br>
core might be trickier than we think), and it also nicely solves the<br>
AI vs. human problem - artificial intelligences will rule the world,<br>
and we will be a part of them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Uploading from this approach can for many of us can be considered to</i><br>
<i>&gt; already be underway.  </i><br>
<p>
Very true. I have noted that I'm slightly less intelligent and efficient<br>
if I don't have access to my website, my search engines, remembrance<br>
agents, editors and files...<br>
