Here I go again, taking the somewhat unpopular position on this list<br>
-- that CSICOP is not scientific.  The scientific method consists of<br>
*objectively* examining evidence for its validity or falsity.  CSICOP<br>
in all the years I have followed them, has yet to *scientifically*<br>
investigate anything.  If they are so scientific, why do they go so<br>
far out of their way to disprove anything that does not fit into their<br>
dogma  of fundamentalist materialism rather than objectively examine<br>
for what it is?<br>
