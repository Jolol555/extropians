Lee:<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I never said that /they/ give a damn.  Self-perception is not reality.</i><br>
<p>
No Lee, you missed my point. what I said was " to use that line of thinking<br>
to ignore the truth of that reality, to NOT acknowledge their very real<br>
experience of starving to death, is denial of the worst sort, and IMO<br>
downright mean. "<br>
Take for example the issue of Affirmative action. One could say " I don't<br>
care for it, it is obviously not working, it is discriminatory in itself, it<br>
has F**cked up many businesses, and it creates far more complex problems than<br>
the simple one ( racist hiring practices) it was conceived to deflect".<br>
But many people chose INSTEAD to claim : RASCISM IS A THING OF THE PAST.<br>
<p>
It sounds bogus and it is. Saying poor people are richer may sound<br>
comforting, but it doesn't address the reality * of those people*. Self<br>
perception may not have anything to do with YOUR reality, but it does for<br>
that individual. If I am hungry - you saying i am not doesn't do much to<br>
change it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  What's "proper"?  "adequate"? </i><br>
<p>
Again, it is a perception. But it is up to the individual to decide, not some<br>
golden mean you make up. I say it means a fairly comfortable creature<br>
existence. Enough money to make ends meet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Why is a recent invention like medical</i><br>
<i>&gt;  care considered a necessity rather than a nifty new product that lots</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of people like?  </i><br>
<p>
Because it is a standard, because we are a technological country, because<br>
other countries provide it, for MANY reasons. However, I assume you throw it<br>
in as a rhetorical device to illustrate that "entitlement" is not a viable<br>
means of obtaining it. In that I agree with you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Name a single person in the US who does not have more</i><br>
<i>&gt;  than sufficient food available to him at no cost.  </i><br>
<p>
I am not on first name terms, but there are plenty - and lots of them are<br>
mentally ill and infants. BTW, I want to stop this now and make it clear: I<br>
am not saying that this problem exists because WE SHOULD FEED THEM -that is a<br>
different subject!  It is maybe because they are too mentally ill to claim<br>
it, or on drugs, or brain deficient, or remote - or something else...but I am<br>
not going to be persuaded they don't exist because one cannot  state one<br>
individual personally on a first name basis. This argument fails to convince.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you keep redefining</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "poor" whenever everyone's life gets better, then there will always be</i><br>
<i>&gt;  poor by definition--and 100 years from now poor people will have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  live in old unsafe wooden houses and drive along the ground in antique</i><br>
<i>&gt;  cars and will have to have cheap plastic glasses instead of corneal</i><br>
<i>&gt;  implants, and have to suffer all kinds of indignities by the standards</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of that day. </i><br>
<p>
Exactly. I do hope the standard of living keeps raising. If those houses<br>
TRULY are unsafe ( you dramatic ending is CUTE) then  we should strive to<br>
eliminate them Just as we should strive to eliminate poverty and other<br>
societal ills. Listen, the poor of tomorrow WILL exist. I don’t know if<br>
things ARE getting better, I hope so. <br>
<p>
If one lacks the necessary tools to survive in that culture ( and by your<br>
description they will) then Evolution will be as unkind today as it is on our<br>
homeless little brothers in the streets...<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;And they will live like the kings of today, just as</i><br>
<i>&gt;  today's poor have benefits today that the rich of 1897 didn't.</i><br>
The kings of today? Name one single king that is living in America today.<br>
