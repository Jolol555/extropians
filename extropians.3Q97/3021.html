<p>
Let's say every time your mind changes, you've died, the only thing keeping<br>
you, as you are your memories.  Memories are physically embodied inside your<br>
brain and have many other elements attached, such as emotion.  We don't know<br>
*everything* about memories, how they work and how to replicate them, and<br>
perhaps we never will.  So if your consciousness only exists as a memory,<br>
it's important to keep those memories consistent.  Gradual uploading should<br>
do this.  But trashing your brain and rebuilding it to the highest level of<br>
detail my not be consistent, and one little glitch in logic and you're gone.<br>
 And if you rebuild your mind in exact detail, you've sort of missed the<br>
point, since it will be slower than its real world counterpart.<br>
<p>
Reality is consistency.<br>
