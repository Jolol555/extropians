<i>&gt;Is John Galt really talking about benevolence here?  This passage seems to </i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
FM: He's not talking about benevolence or "non-benevolence"<br>
at all.  He does talk about loyalty to himself and no<br>
subservience to others.<br>
<p>
The reason for my post is that certain people, when talking<br>
about "no obligations" were being incorrectly accused of not<br>
having compassion and of not wanting to help others.<br>
<p>
I'm saying there's no link between "no obligations" on the<br>
one hand, and compassion/benevolence on the other hand.<br>
<p>
There are people who believe in "no obligations" who are<br>
compassionate/benevolent.  There are people who believe<br>
in "no obligations" who are uncompassionate/malevolent.<br>
There are people who believe in obligations who are<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;That someone says, "I have no obligation to help another," says </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;absolutely nothing about whether that person has compassion or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Kathryn Aegis:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes.  In fact, social scientists who study benevolence rarely link </i><br>
<i>&gt;the two, because a new view of benevolence is emerging.  Within the </i><br>
<i>&gt;context of the set of personal or group relationships affected by it, </i><br>
<i>&gt;an act of benevolence can be viewed as an investment with a </i><br>
<i>&gt;future return, as a method of cementing community relationships, or </i><br>
<i>&gt;as a method of expressing one's social status.  One could go so far </i><br>
<i>&gt;as to state that no one gives anyone anything without some </i><br>
<i>&gt;expectation of some sort of tangible or intangible future return, </i><br>
<i>&gt;thus calling into question the entire concept of compassion.  The </i><br>
<i>&gt;idea of compassion may be a holdover from earlier times when we </i><br>
<i>&gt;humans did not fully understand (or want to face!) our own </i><br>
<i>&gt;motivations for acting in a benevolent manner.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I think we can make a distinction between benevolence<br>
as attitude and compassion as emotion.<br>
<p>
This morning in a parking lot a man asked me if he<br>
could wash my car windows for a little change.  I<br>
declined and walked away to dispose of my shopping<br>
cart.  Then I felt sorry for him, after all, he did<br>
offer to work for the money.  My compassion triggered<br>
my benevolence and I walked back to him and gave him $5.<br>
<p>
To him, in his situation, $5 is probably quite significant;<br>
to me it's almost like nothing.  And I did gain a feeling<br>
of having done my good deed for the day.  I probably felt<br>
a little bit happier, having given him $5, than I would<br>
have felt, giving him nothing.<br>
<p>
Generally, in voluntary transactions, both parties gain.<br>

and the achievement of his own happiness is his highest moral purpose."<br>
