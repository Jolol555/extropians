You have fallen for an urban legend. Actually, the posted text is extremely <br>
typical for urban legends (friend of a friend stories, many themes which<br>
recur in other urban legends, a horrifying but unusual theme, suggestions<br>
that sin (drinking, girls or drugs) are involved, "realistic details"<br>
like the 911 number etc). See any standard textbook about urban<br>
legends. <br>
<p>
See for example<br>

<p>
See especially<br>
<a href="http://urbanlegends.miningco.com/library/weekly/aa062997.htm">http://urbanlegends.miningco.com/library/weekly/aa062997.htm</a><br>
which deals with the NO rumor. <br>
<p>
If you think about it, the story falls apart completely. Organ<br>
transplants have rejection problems, which means you can't transplant<br>
an organ from a random donor to a patient. Using random people you<br>
have not tissue-typed will likely lead to rejection, not to mention<br>
the risks of spreading disease. So while there might be unscrupulous<br>
people who might be willing to sell others organs, there would be<br>
few buyers who would want them. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We really need to push the bio-tech reasearch that will allow us to use pig</i><br>
<i>&gt; kidneys or such (I've heard of pighearts as donororgans), as</i><br>
<i>&gt; transplantation technology becomes more advanced the shortage of organs</i><br>
<i>&gt; will rise, and thus their black-market value.</i><br>
<p>
While I think xenografts are a good thing (although I am concerned with<br>
retroviral infections) and also would like more development of artificial<br>
organs, this will not likely solve any black market problem.<br>
In fact, it is uncertain if there is a black market problem for organs<br>
right now. There is however a noticeable lack of organs.<br>
<p>
I have been thinking about the current bans on selling organs. The<br>
idea is that it is unfair of selling life-saving organs and that they<br>
should be donated (and perhaps also to prevent poor from selling their<br>
organs). Does it do more good than harm? While I'm certainly not<br>
as market-happy as many (most?) extropians, this is one area where<br>
I have seriously considered a free market solution. <br>
<p>
Right now there is some international cooperation to match organs<br>
and patients, but this is a non-profit collaboration. Since the<br>
rules for donation and transplantation are different in different<br>
countries, there is a constant low-key grumble about some <br>
countries not doing their part or being "organ sinks". <br>
<p>
Allowing organ trade would produce an incentive to provide organs (or <br>
replacements), and would convince at least some people that it would <br>
be a good idea to become donors. In fact, it is a bit strange that<br>
we do not have full rights to our bodies in this respect: should<br>
we not be allowed to do what we want with them (assuming us being of <br>
sound mind, not coerced etc)? If I decide to sell a kidney instead<br>
of donating it, what is wrong with that decision? One could argue<br>
that it is somewhat selfish, but do we not have the right to<br>
do our own valuations, even if they are selfish? We have the right<br>
to *refuse* donating organs, which could be seen as even more selfish. <br>
<p>
Of course, many have argued that this would lead to a situation<br>
where the rich would buy the organs of the poor. But it would<br>
be a fair trade (assuming the right legal supervision), and a<br>
sellers' market: the patient would want a high-quality organ,<br>
and the set of known tissue-compatible donors would be small. <br>
In the long run it seems to me that the organ shortage can<br>
be solved, partially due to technological advances spurred<br>
by the market (organ cloning, organ freezing, xenografts and<br>
implants), partially because there would be more organs<br>
available. <br>
<p>
Would this do more harm than good? Strict legal controls are<br>
of course needed to prevent organ theft, but given the need<br>
for other strict medical and logistic controls in organ<br>
handling suggests that this would be possible; theft can<br>
probably be avoided since it is in the interests of all<br>
parts (patients, health care providers and donors) to keep<br>
the business "clean". It would also be necessary to<br>
avoid having go-betweens earning undue profits; a <br>
certification scheme might work and would fit fine with<br>
the current trends in medical quality control. The<br>
same might go for informed consent, which already apply<br>
to donation. <br>
<p>
So it seems that if the trade could be kept legit, there<br>
IMHO would be little reason to believe trade in organs<br>
would harm more people than it helped. <br>
