<i>&gt;&gt; I raise the possibility of disagreement precisely because our ethical</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; systems militate against it so strongly.  Our evolved morality may know</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; more than you do.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is an interesting question.  ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;If we think of ethics as distilling our experience of the long-term</i><br>
<i>&gt;consequences of our actions, then this suggests that there is something</i><br>
<i>&gt;mistaken with the reasoning in favor of preemptive strikes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A recent historical example would be the situation immediately after</i><br>
<i>&gt;WWII, when the U.S. had sole possession of the atomic bomb.  There was</i><br>
<i>&gt;undoubtedly debate </i><br>
<p>
Yes, there was.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;about using this power preemptively against the USSR,</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Indeed, the cost of not conquering the Soviet Union was considerable:</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Cold War; years of mistreatment of its population and its ecology</i><br>
<i>&gt;by the Soviet government; justification of American excesses as necessary</i><br>
<i>&gt;to stop the Red menace.</i><br>
<p>
There is also an argument that the Pax Americana _bolstered_ <br>
the Soviet Union, and delayed its natural collapse. The continuous<br>
military threat posed by America gave the Soviet government justification<br>
for their totalitarian practices. Do note that almost every escalation in<br>
the Cold War (Nuclear War 1) (first atom bomb, first use in warfare,<br>
 first H bomb, first stockpiling, first nuclear sub, first MIRVs, <br>
etc., ad naseum.) was made by the US.<br>
<p>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt;The result would be a nightmare Borgism, a nearly mindless plague whose</i><br>
<i>&gt;only goal was conquest, spreading throughout the universe.  This would</i><br>
<i>&gt;all flow from that first step of destruction.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Consider, in contrast, an entity which takes the harder road from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;beginning, seeking to embrace diversity and work with competitors who</i><br>
<i>&gt;are its equals.  Its survival is less certain; the resources it will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;able to command directly will be more limited.  But the diversity which</i><br>
<i>&gt;results will be a positive benefit in and of itself.  And the need to</i><br>
<i>&gt;deal flexibly and creatively with competitors will arguably make it</i><br>
<i>&gt;better prepared to deal with surprises which the universe throws at it</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the future.</i><br>
<p>
This is what I was trying to drive at in the information loss objection.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Granted, this is a pretty fuzzy argument.  In particular, the notion</i><br>
<i>&gt;of being tainted by evil actions sounds melodramatic and old fashioned.</i><br>
<i>&gt;But as Damien says, our ethical systems do embody a considerable history</i><br>
<i>&gt;of experience, even when wrapped in mystical or religious trappings.</i><br>
<i>&gt;An ethical meme which kills its host is less likely to survive.  So we</i><br>
<i>&gt;should not ignore our ethical views too easily.  Evil actions may have</i><br>
<i>&gt;subtle negative consequences which we tend to overlook.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

Thank you, Hal<br>
