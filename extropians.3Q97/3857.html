Thank you for this clarification.  I did not realize the<br>
significance of the word "initiate."<br>

<p>
However, it appears to me that while the definition i quoted<br>
might be a good starting point, the issue quickly decomposes<br>
into intricate judgement calls.<br>
<p>
For example, retaliating to an "initiated force" such as, say,<br>
stealing an apple by killing the thief would seem unreasonable<br>
to most.  Then one needs to debate the magnitude of the reaction<br>
as compared to the initiated force.<br>
<p>
Similarly the definition could support other kinds of<br>
retaliation, e.g. the police arrest you for making<br>
inflammatory statements about the inefficiencies of government<br>
because it constitutes aggression against the state.  With<br>
sufficient effort one could probably divert the definition to<br>
support almost any viewpoint.<br>
<p>
But anyway, i have a hard time reconciling the libertarian<br>
view of little-or-no-government with the need for a system of<br>
basic laws and enforcement.  How does one keep a city safe<br>
without spending a sizable amount of money on a police force?<br>
(Lesson two for me?)<br>
