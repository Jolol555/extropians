In a message dated 97-07-13 12:22:05 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; would<br>
 you say that someone who cannot speak and hear is not conscious?  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
They might NOT be.  I refer to "wolf-children" who could not be taught to<br>
speak".<br>
<p>
Is it possible that the human persona program must be "Booted" up in a<br>
certain sequence relative to the biological changes of physical growth or not<br>
boot up at all?<br>
<p>
I've heard that children can learn multiple languages easily...whereas<br>
adults...I for one...have a difficult time learning another language...I've<br>
heard that if a child is not taught to read prior to a certain age then<br>
subsequently it will become much more difficult...<br>
<p>
A person who cannot see nor hear (nor speak)is probably conscious (Helen<br>
Keller. I beleive was a blind deaf mute)..but she was in constant<br>
communication...she had a dedicated nurse who went to great effort. .. (I'm<br>
rather vauge on the details I'm afraid)...to teach her to communicate.  Is it<br>
possible that the act of learning to communicate...the inherent ability TOO<br>
communicate is somehow prerequisit to self Awareness (what we're calling<br>
consciousness)<br>
<p>
Hard questions...tough subject...VERY interesting.<br>
