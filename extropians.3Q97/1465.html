Yes, I have often been thinking about seceeding from homo sapiens and<br>
starting my new species. Unfortunately, for the moment that would be<br>
mainly a gesture and a rather ineffectual one for that matter. Of<br>
course, if a lot of transhumanists together began to talk about<br>
seceeding, things might be different. <br>
<p>
One problem is that the majority would not like these ideas one bit. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Most of us are here scientists and could try to prepair a</i><br>

<i>&gt; journals, where we would define the characterics of the new human</i><br>
<i>&gt; species. </i><br>
<p>
One cannot define a species into existence; it has to evolve. A paper<br>
describing homo cyber would either be a post fact description, or an<br>
attempt to prescribe a certain path. What about the transhumanists<br>
who, for whatever reason, decide to evolve in another direction? I<br>
don't think the future belongs to one species, I believe it belongs<br>
to a whole taxum. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When a new species feels the real necessity to take a </i><br>
<i>&gt; better way of Evolution.</i><br>
<p>
Feels the necessty? Aren't you a bit too teleological here? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Besides that, it is * very stressing*  and even dangerous </i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to convince the Homo sapiens, in particular the "teological" </i><br>
<i>&gt; variety, to really evolute ( some of then have even created a </i><br>
<i>&gt; heaven...and "perfectly" created by  a "perfect  being, so, what </i><br>

<i>&gt; welcome, who not, just DO NOT PERTURB!!!</i><br>
<p>
I agree with you on this; there is no point forcing our values onto<br>
others just as we don't want values forced upon us. That is why a<br>
separation may be a good thing, but usually separations also lead to<br>
conflicts (when you encounter the Xs daily, it is harder to become<br>
prejudiced against them than if you rarely meet them).<br>
