One of possible kinetical inhitors to Drexlerian nanotech has<br>
been the bootstrap bottleneck: how to get from here to there<br>
(i.e. from current STM/solvated (bio)chemistry to dry, rigid<br>
machine-phase systems). Fortunately, there might a comparatively<br>
simple way to widen that bottleneck.<br>
<p>
Jerry March, "Advanced Organic Chemistry", 3rd ed. John Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons (1985), pp. 961-962 says (copious references omitted): "It<br>
was mentioned above that even alkanes undergo Wagner-Meerwein<br>
rearragements if treated with with Lewis acids and a small<br>
amount of initiator. An interesting application of this reaction<br>
is the conversion of trycyclic molecules to adamantane and its<br>
derivatives. It has been found that _all_ tricyclic alkanes<br>
containing 10 carbons are converted to adamantane by treatment<br>
with a Lewis acids such as AlCl_3. If the substrate contains<br>
more than 10 carbons, alkyl-substituted adamantanes are<br>
produced. Some examples are [ Fig: tetramethyladamantane from<br>
norbornene + cyclic polyenes Diels-Alder adducts and diamantane<br>
from hydrogenated annelated aromates ]. If 14 or more carbons<br>
are present the product may be diamantane or a substituted<br>
diamantane. These reactions are successful because of the high<br>
thermodynamic stability of adamantane, diamantane, and similiar<br>
diamond-like molecules. The most stable of a set of C_nH_m<br>
isomers (called the stabilomer) will be the end product if the<br>
reaction reaches equilibrium. Best yields are obtained by the<br>
use of "sludge" catalysts (i.e. a mixture of AlX_3 and t-butyl<br>
bromide or sec-butyl bromide) or by passing the substrate in the<br>
gas phase through a tube containing a chlorinated<br>
platinum-alumina catalyst. Though it is certain that these<br>
adamantane-forming reactions take place by nucleophilic 1,2<br>
shifts, the exact pathways are not easy to unravel because of<br>
their complexity. Treatment of adamantane-2-14^C with AlCl_3<br>
results in total carbon scrambling on a statistical basis".<br>
<p>
Obviously, small carbon diamondoids are trivial to obtain in<br>
good yields (the almost-forgotten adamantane rush preceded that<br>
of the buckball craze decades before). Through this is not<br>
mentioned in literature, I guess large branched/cycled<br>
carbohydrogens rearrange to (defect-rich, but who cares)<br>
diamondoids easily enough. A statistical small carbon cluster<br>
synthesis is therefore easy to accomplish. A random CAS<br>
(Chemical AbstracS) inquiry from years ago said that<br>
quantitative polyfluorination of adamantane is easy to<br>
accomplish by an electrochemical process (anodical fluorination<br>
of adamantane in anhydrous HF).<br>
<p>
Carbon-carbon bond formation via Wurtz-class metalloorganyles<br>
(Grignard, lithium, copper, or whatever) reactions is a<br>
time-honoured technique of organic synthesis.<br>
<p>
Manipulative proximal probe spectroscopy and GA solution of the<br>
knapsack problem are the new pungent spices in the statistical<br>
pot.<br>
<p>
A possible scenario would involve cooking a wild mixture of<br>
different polycyclic alkanes at high temperatures<br>
(alternatively, in the gas phase), then a flash chromatography<br>
of the quenched mess to get rid of the coarsest muck. Using de<br>
novo designed antibody affinity columns, an arbitrarily precise<br>
separation stage could ensue. Alternatively, halogenated and/or<br>
metallated adamantanes could be spread out on HOPG tablets at<br>
cryo UHV conditions, and be mapped via a STM/SPM scan. Those 3d<br>
puzzle pieces best fitting the virtual machinery mold (which<br>
requires a _hefty_ (GA) crunch run), and then be assembled via<br>
manipulative proximal probe microscopy. Once in place, they<br>
crosslink by multiple C-C instantly, irreversibly. (Using<br>
phlegmatized surface groups, this should be worthwhile to try<br>
even in solvated phase, xref autoassembly via complementary<br>
surfaces).<br>
<p>
By this means, a first generation of diamondoid devices could be<br>
assembled. If they are stiff enough to avoid progressive defect<br>
runaway at autoreplication, the bootstrap bottleneck is thus<br>
shattered to pieces.<br>

P.S. Please observe that PPM, biochemistry and numerical<br>
modeling star in above speculative scenario, synthetic chemistry<br>
is, once again, the Assipattle here. <br>
