It depends on exactly which kind of fuel cell Mercedes-Benz rolls out.<br>
<p>
The most practical kind of fuel cell would use a common liquid fuel, say<br>
methyl or ethyl alcohol, and <br>
somehow dissociate just the hydrogen for use in a hydrox fuel cell with the<br>
oxygen from the air. That would have a significant impact in that rice,<br>
wheat, sorghum and other crops would become more practical sources of<br>
energy for transportation than they are currently. Shifts in price supports<br>
and subsidies for these sorts of crops might or might not occur, and<br>
there's be more of a direct competition between fuel and food/feed uses for<br>
same. Different parts of cars would require some changes, since there are<br>
seals, tubing etc. that like nonpolar hydrocarbons better than polar.<br>
Tuning of engines would be different; high-proof alcohol evaporates faster<br>
than gasoline and might be considered more dangerous as a vapor... And some<br>
people would try to drink the stuff, I guarantee.<br>
<p>
Hydrogen as metal hydrides is somewhat less convenient, and "bare" H2 as<br>
gas or liquid even more so (bulky!). Either of those two approaches would<br>
fundamentally change the tooling as you mentioned, and also the<br>
distribution chains, were they to become accepted or *shudder* mandated.<br>
<p>
The expected lifetime of the fuel cell catalyst bed also is crucial in<br>
assessing the impact of this product. There are alcohol-air fuel cells<br>
right now--they just cost too much and don't last long enough, due to<br>
eventual contamination.<br>
