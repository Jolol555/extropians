Abraham Moses Genen (who doesn't know how to flag quotes or<br>
trim followups so I've taken the liberty of doing it for him)<br>
writes<br>
<p>
: During my service to the US Congress I was involved in drafting and/or<br>
: analyzing several thousand pieces of legislation that effected and<br>
: (hopefully) helped to advance the cause of social evolution.<br>
:<br>
: I could name more than a few pieces of legislation I helped to<br>
: formulate but it would be quite meaningless in the overall context<br>
: of our continuing social evolution.<br>
<p>
Well, did you have a favorite?  Can you tell us what general area<br>
was your specialty, if any?  Can you, in short, tell us *anything*<br>
more than simply inviting us to take it on faith that acts of<br>
the legislature are, on balance, beneficial by definition?<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
: Almost all of the public is quite unaware of how the legislative process<br>
: actually works. Among the many things I'm still learning is that any<br>
: relationship between political science as taught in most colleges and<br>
: universities and governmental administration as it actually functions<br>
: and transpires is purely coincidental.<br>
<p>
We know that; we've seen "Yes Minister".  :-/<br>
<p>
: Civics, as taught in almost all secondary schools is, at best,<br>
: horribly superficial and frequently misguided.  [...]<br>
<p>
Well, of course.  The purpose of such "teaching" is to train<br>
obedient subjects to keep up the democratic rituals, no more.<br>
<p>
: During my current work with the NYS legislature, I frequently focus on<br>
: consumer protection legislation as an example in point. But, most of my<br>
: modifications to the general business law, the general obligations law,<br>
: etc., receive scant public notice.<br>
<p>
The folks who buy such legislation are probably content with the amount<br>
of public notice it doesn't get.  ;)<br>
<p>
: Since the focus of this discussion is supposed to be on the philosophy<br>
: of advancing humanity through various means I dont see any point in being<br>
: any more specific. My purpose in this academic exchange is to expand my<br>
: horizons by learning as well as expressing my experiential views.<br>
:<br>
: I trust that you will all respect that.<br>
<p>
Well, okay, but if you're not going to be any more specific,<br>
the anarchists among us (what, here?) will just have to assume<br>
that when you talk vaguely about the benefits of interventionist<br>
legislation, you're either a naive pawn, or a wannabe-politician<br>
rehearsing the time-honored fraudulent platitudes.<br>
