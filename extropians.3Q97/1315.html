<i> &gt;I don't want to raise the heat in this conversation unecessarily, but in</i><br>
<i> &gt;the interest of clarity I would want to reiterate that as far as I'm</i><br>
<i> &gt;concerned every lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgendered person in the</i><br>
<i> &gt;United States might properly be regarded as "under attack,"</i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Well...let me give you my take on that.  I call it stereotypical<br>
response...response to stereotypes.<br>
<p>
Now stereotypical response is a survival characteristic.  It was for me while<br>
participating in the South East Asian War Games....It was for ancesteroral<br>
man when confronted by a hairy, toothy critter with claws and an evil<br>
disposition...It STILL is for me today...(deceptive camoflauge...I'll touch<br>
on that later)<br>
<p>
Now I LIKE Gays...I wish there were more of them...because for every gay man<br>
that means there is less competetion for me in my search for  a compatable<br>
lady.  And I must philosophicaly agree with Lesbians...we both like the same<br>
thing.<br>
<p>
However :  Many times when I have to drive thru a big city  late at night<br>
there will be a car pull up beside me while traveling down the freeway...the<br>
dome light will come on and there will be a guy jerking off...sometimes he<br>
will then pull in front of me and hit his brakes...trying to get me to pull<br>
over.(Once a cop saw this happen, he pulled us both over..got my story of<br>
what  happened and sent me on my way...no doubt there's a story about "Mean<br>
cop molesting poor Gay Man" circulating over that)<br>
<p>
I no longer listen to the CB radio....there always seems to be someone on<br>
there with a pronounced lisp...the dominate word is "Cum-Cum"...<br>
<p>
Once when I put an "ad" on a computer dating service I was overwhelmed by<br>
responses from gay men...even though my ad was in the "men seeking women"<br>
category.<br>
<p>
Prior to "deceptive camoflauge"..many times when walking from my truck to the<br>
Resturant in a Truck Stop I would be acosted by Queers...After the second or<br>
third time of having to knot a head to get him to leave me alone I decided<br>
something had to be done.<br>
<p>
That someting was "deceptive camoflauge"...I now weigh 260lbs...(result of<br>
concentration curls and budweiser curls"...have full beard and long<br>
hair...dress all in black, wear wrap-around sunglasses...heavy<br>
boots...leather biker headscarve...smoke nasty ceeegars...carry what appear<br>
to be various weapons...and don't smile much....the queers leave me<br>
alone.(the laptop computer under my arm kinda spoils the picture...I'm<br>
working on that)<br>
<p>
The gays around truck-stops and trucks behave in such a way as to evoke a<br>
sterotype.  That is the truckers see how the gays they encounter behave and<br>
stereotypicaly assign that behavior to all gays.<br>
<p>
The gays around the truck-stops see me dressed as the stereotypical<br>
pyschopathic, killer biker...with weapons yet...and they assume a<br>
stereotype...after all gays are kind,gentle and loving....they would want<br>
nothing to do with such as I.....right?<br>
<p>
The point I'm making is that perhaps the societal response to "Gays" is self<br>
inflicted...you're not going to change stereotypical response...it's genetic<br>
and still too useful...so change your stereo type.  You need better PR. <br>
<p>
And the Maplethorpe exhibit...the attack on the Catholic Church in San<br>
Francisco , conspicious displays of affection between men in public, and<br>
other "in your face"...consciousness raising....tactics ain't it.<br>
<p>
(unfortunately...what runs off cruising gays also runs off potentially<br>
compatable wome....oh well...guess being a bachelor ain't so bad)<br>
