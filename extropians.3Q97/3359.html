I don't think I liked the way Holly Pearson phrased the issues involved. =<br>
 His<br>
impending economic collapse seemed too much like a social conflict, not a=<br>
<p>
blind consequence of increasing technology.  There may be winners and los=<br>
ers,<br>
but they are irrelevant and unintentional.  Like most technological<br>
consequences, it is not in the least inevitable; it only takes more techn=<br>
ology<br>
to counter.<br>
<p>
Our economy will either collapse or transform.  *Which* will depend on wh=<br>
ether<br>
we're smart enough, and flexible enough, to redesign it along the necessa=<br>
ry lines.<br>
<p>
I have had thoughts along those lines, and they shone through in "Staring=<br>
 Into<br>
The Singularity".  Hence the quote, I suppose.<br>
<p>
=46rom "The Economy Of Plenty", an unfinished work:  (=A91997 by Eliezer =<br>
S. Yudkowsky.)<br>
<p>
-- The Economy of Plenty --<br>
<p>
The basic problem is economies of scale.  At our level of technology, it =<br>
only<br>
takes a billion people working to support six billion.  And then the othe=<br>
r<br>
five billion starve, and you start over with one billion and two hundred<br>
million, until you've got a self-supporting community of ten million peop=<br>
le<br>
and the six billion are dead.<br>
<p>
There are four obvious solutions.  First, give everyone a Universal Stand=<br>
ard<br>
Wage.  Second, break up humanity into units of ten million and forbid res=<br>
ource<br>
transfers between them.  Three, raise the standard of living until there'=<br>
s<br>
enough work for everyone.  Four, distribute the work more evenly.<br>
<p>
Solution one:  In essence, this amounts to dividing humanity into workers=<br>
 and<br>
drones.  It differs from Communism in that in Communism, everyone was sup=<br>
posed<br>
to work and nobody did, while here, only a few people will be supposed to=<br>
<p>
work.  I don't think this solution, or any other which involves dividing<br>
humanity, will be stable.  The class conflict will destroy it, and the "W=<br>
hy<br>
should *I* work?" problem will still be present.<br>
<p>
How to make it work:  Instead of dividing humanity, abolish *all* work.  =<br>
Go<br>
the rest of the way from one billion supporting six billion to zero suppo=<br>
rting<br>
six billion.  Build arcologies which require only a few thousand people,<br>
*total*, to sustain the entire planet at a minimal standard of living.  T=<br>
hen<br>
paste the current economy on top of that.  If this is stable, the rate of=<br>
<p>
progress to Singularity will slow down, but we'll have all the time neces=<br>
sary<br>
to get it right the first time.<br>
<p>
Solution two:  Partition humanity into six hundred economies.  This will<br>
falter on limited resources, brains as well as arable land, of which we h=<br>
ave<br>
enough to support five or even twenty economies, but not hundreds.  For t=<br>
his<br>
planet to support six billion, we need technological economies of scale. =<br>
 =<br>
<p>
<p>
How to make it work:  I don't know yet.<br>
<p>
Solution three:  Raise the standard of living.  Why hasn't this happened<br>
already?  That is, how can we be running out of work when people are stil=<br>
l<br>
poor and hungry?  The answer is that these people are unemployed, hence d=<br>
o not<br>
have any money, hence cannot pay for supplies, and hence do not add to de=<br>
mand.<br>
 First let's see us raise the demand to match the current supply, much le=<br>
ss<br>
the supply available if everyone worked!<br>
<p>
How to make it work:  This gets kind of complicated, and requires massive=<br>
<p>
computing power.  Essentially, you have to get rid of money and replace i=<br>
t<br>
with a barter system.  We *can* do this now because we have enough comput=<br>
ing<br>
power to institute "complex barter" systems.  This takes some explaining.=<br>
  A<br>
simple barter transaction is one in which A gives B a pineapple, and B gi=<br>
ves A a<br>
coconut.  A complex barter is where A gives B a pineapple, B gives C a<br>
coconut, and C gives A a watermelon.  Note the triple cycle.  Complex bar=<br>
ter<br>
is too hard to keep track of - without computers, heh heh heh - which is =<br>
why<br>
we have money, to transform every transaction into a simple barter.  By<br>
"money", we here mean something with artificial value, rather than univer=<br>
sal<br>
units of exchange.  A complex barter system can still have standardized u=<br>
nits<br>
of valuation.<br>
<p>
What would be accomplished by this?  Well, one of the economic design fla=<br>
ws<br>
leading to our current problem is - more than I can finish this sentence =<br>
with.<br>
 Here's what happens.  Person A, who builds widgets, builds 100 widgets. =<br>
 B<br>
through K also build 100 widgets.  Unfortunately, there is only a market =<br>
for<br>
1,000 widgets total.  But 1,100 have been built.<br>
<p>
The standard capitalistic reply at this point is that G, who isn't very g=<br>
ood<br>
at this, goes out of business.  There are only two problems:  First, G ca=<br>
n't<br>
get another job, and more importantly, that's NOT what actually happens! =<br>
<p>
Instead, the price of widgets drops.  Like a brick.  They trade widgets f=<br>
or<br>
cigar bands on a one-to-one basis.  The result is that not even E, who's =<br>
the<br>
best, can make a living - much less G.<br>
<p>
In an ideal world, this overproduction would simply raise standards of li=<br>
ving.<br>
 Really.  Think about it.  There are more widgets for everyone!  Hooray! =<br>
<p>
Again, ideally, food would be overproduced.  So the price of food would d=<br>
rop<br>
as well.  The price of everything would drop, and widgets would be dirt c=<br>
heap,<br>
but so would be everything else, and A and E and G and K would all be ric=<br>
h.<br>
<p>
The problem is that production of food is out of sync with production of<br>
widgets.  The current economy was BUILT ON SCARCITY.  Everyone, everythin=<br>
g, is<br>
centered on the idea that supply is always slightly less than demand.  If=<br>
 one<br>
- and only one - field shifts to a massive-supply model, that field suffe=<br>
rs. =<br>
<p>
It's like being the only cooperator in a world of defectors.  You need a<br>
massive shift.<br>
<p>
And again, the existence of money is the problem.  Not private property! =<br>
 I'm<br>
not saying that.  The problem is money instead of barter.  See, in a bart=<br>
er<br>
system, you can establish valuations that can outlast supply and demand, =<br>
or at<br>
least weather the turbulence created by switching to an Economy of Plenty=<br>
=2E =<br>
<p>
Suppose that we declare one widget to equal one hamburger in value.  Now,=<br>
 even<br>
if there are too many widgets, anyone who's made a widget can still get a=<br>
<p>
hamburger in exchange.  G's widgets might rot, but that's better than all=<br>
 the<br>
widgets rotting.  We'll assume, actually, the existence of some buffer, s=<br>
ome<br>
temporary charitable system, so that G remains in business for at least a=<br>
<p>
month or two - while the production of hamburgers increases also.<br>
<p>
We can also move up to establish a futures market - even better than bart=<br>
er -<br>
for absolutely everything on the planet.  Then even G's widgets don't rot=<br>
=2E =<br>
<p>
Instead, everyone sells 91 widgets instead of 100 - which may sound bad, =<br>
but<br>
that's on a G-just-went-into-business model.  If you assume a technologic=<br>
al<br>
overproduction, 91 widgets is just what they sold last year.  It's<br>
technological overproduction that's the problem, after all - population<br>
expansion is self-correcting.  So everyone has an extra 9 widgets to trad=<br>
e for<br>
whatever they want.  Hopefully, someone besides widget-makers is<br>
overproducing, so the surplus can all be traded around.<br>
<p>
Eventually, everyone overproduces, and those who produce the most wind up=<br>
 with<br>
the most of the overproduction.  So the system has two parts, really:  On=<br>
e, a<br>
futures market (applied to EVERYTHING) so that overproduction doesn't cau=<br>
se<br>
prices to drop, and two, a complex barter system - whose necessity is kin=<br>
d of<br>
hard to put into words, but...  The value of a dollar is arbitrary.  If a=<br>
<p>
widget-future involves $5 a widget, the value of the contract is affected=<br>
 by<br>
fluctuations in the money supply as well as the supply of widgets.  A<br>
widget-future which involves trading one hundred hamburgers for one hundr=<br>
ed<br>
widgets may fluctuate all over the place in THEORY, but in practice, one<br>
hundred hamburgers are what the widget-maker will eat this year.  In othe=<br>
r<br>
words, the universal futures economy is very vulnerable to inflation, whi=<br>
ch a<br>
complex-barter system will stop.<br>
<p>
Solution four:  Distribute the work more evenly.  How can I say that we'r=<br>
e<br>
running out of work, when everyone WITH a job is spending every waking ho=<br>
ur on<br>
their job?  The problem is that ***<br>
[End of work in progress.]<br>
<p>
To summarize #4, you'd need to entirely revamp the structure of a corpora=<br>
tion<br>
along certain lines.  This would be even more complex than the complex-ba=<br>
rter<br>
bit, which itself should really have diagrams.  The solution to number fo=<br>
ur<br>
requires complex barter as a *prerequisite*, and something called<br>
collaborative filtering, and even substantial alterations to American law=<br>
=2E =<br>
