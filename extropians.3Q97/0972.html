<p>
It's simply that things similar to replicators are a potential future<br>
technology, while pole shift is stupid pseudo-science.  With nanotech we<br>
may have some of the capabilities of replicators within our lifetimes.<br>
Don't you see how useful it is to start thinking about the implications<br>
of such a revolutionary technology?  But pole shift?  Anybody with an<br>
inkling of understanding of science should be able to see what a stupid<br>
idea that is!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      This is a digest for goodness sake!</i><br>
<p>
(FYI, a more accurate term is "mailing list", although some subscribers<br>
may be receiving it in digested form.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      It amazes me that people get irked by the extra few seconds to </i><br>
<i>&gt;      download something they would eventually judge unworthy or the extra </i><br>
<i>&gt;      pressure they have to exert on the finger they apply to the page down </i><br>
<i>&gt;      key.</i><br>
<p>
There are larger implications.  By filling the list with stupid ideas,<br>
we will attract the kind of people who like such things.  It's a fact<br>
of life on the net: quality attracts quality, and the opposite is true<br>
as well.  Ultimately the goal of comments like Perry's is to encourage<br>
the kinds of discussions that will attract and keep the many fine thinkers<br>
the list has had.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      If the Extropian Digest of yore was filled with this kind of </i><br>
<i>&gt;      pontifical grandstanding, then apparently a great many of its </i><br>
<i>&gt;      contributors have discovered the wonderous benefits of a good </i><br>
<i>&gt;      laxative.  Check with your local Walgreens.  There's help available. </i><br>
<i>&gt;      &lt;G&gt;</i><br>
<p>
It is true that in the past, the mailing list has suffered from bickering<br>
and negative comments.  At the same time, there were informed, intelligent<br>
discussions on a wide range of topics.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      Incidentally, I would say that most of us on this list are elitist </i><br>
<i>&gt;      about one thing or another.  Humility and benevolence, as I have thus </i><br>
<i>&gt;      far observed, are not particularly Extropian traits, at least not in </i><br>
<i>&gt;      any explicit sense.  That's okay.  The ideas are high octane.  I'm </i><br>
<i>&gt;      sure there's a list elsewhere for Mother Teresa and Gandhi fans.</i><br>
<p>
Actually I think Perry spoke for many readers.  I haven't been happy with<br>
some of the recent topics.  In fact, I suspect that Perry restrained himself<br>
for some time, hoping that the spate of pseudoscience would blow over.<br>
Instead (as happens all too often) it only encouraged more of the same.<br>
At some point you have to respond.<br>
