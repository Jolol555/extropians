..... and why is so difficult to remove it .... but agree that it was very<br>
inteligent to use faith as an axiom....<br>

obstructed...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;doctorates in physics, who would insist that every word of the Old Testament</i><br>

*** more nervous !!!! and the evolution, the artificialization of the body,<br>
the clones for organ transplantation ....????<br>
... they are still trying to manage their inner psichological conflicts and<br>
we waiting, waiting...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;They make take offense, but I would stand by my view that their belief is</i><br>
<i>&gt;not in accordance with the evidence. Surely you are not suggesting that a</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ph.D. in physics can rationally hold that "every word of the Old Testament</i><br>
<i>&gt;is unvarnished and unmetaphorical fact"? The Earth is only a few thousand</i><br>
<i>&gt;years old?....</i><br>
<p>
*** and possibly flat....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; God created Adam and Eve and there was no evolution. </i><br>
<p>
*** in their minds... just the usage of clothes, what I disagree...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Such a</i><br>
<i>&gt;physics Ph.D. would have a faith in both senses of the term -- a belief in</i><br>
<i>&gt;a doctrine, and a belief insensitive to evidence.</i><br>
<p>
*** and, very interesting phenomena, to be more seriously studied, like the<br>
so-called paranormal ones, waiting for being analised... or the nocive and<br>
suicidal tendencies of some "saints, still influencing lots of minds...<br>
principally of poorer people...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;While it is not my intention to intervene in religious disputes at this</i><br>
<i>&gt;time -</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I feel we'll all know who was right soon enough -</i><br>
<p>
*** But, to teach never is bad....They'll understand sooner or later...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I do feel it necessary to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;remind everyone that there are sincerely and unapologetically religious</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;people, who are often involved with charitable issues</i><br>
<p>
*** The only thing that will really survive after the end of religions and<br>
the beginning of a self-sustainable good in the human minds ( and<br>
education...)... <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; and generally spread a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;little Light around, even if it is in the name of God. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
*** Children learning to walk...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ..... I don't event think that religions are entirely bad</i><br>
<i>&gt;things,......</i><br>
<p>
*** Just filter the good part of their programming....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; though I *do* think that faith in the sense of anti-rationalism is</i><br>
<i>&gt;bad. </i><br>
<p>
*** faith in lies and... worse... transmitting such lies...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't for a moment despise religious people even when I get email like</i><br>
<i>&gt;this from Christians in response to my In Praise of the Devil:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;you are a shit man.fuck you</i><br>
<i>&gt;(That one came today. A few days ago I got this one:)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Hey Pee-brain!!!!!!!!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Read the Bible again, and use your fucking "critical thinking"!!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Let me make an analogy for your sorry sucker's ass.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;God did not tell us to drive slowly and take no risks for joy!!!He simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;warned us to drive safely and wear your fucking seat belt!!!!!!  </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The Bible</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;never said to not be happy!!! </i><br>
<p>
*** Such worm's "brain" certainly did not read all the "bible"...<br>
..........<br>
<i>&gt;.... And most of these religious framewords contain something of</i><br>
<i>&gt;value....</i><br>
<p>
*** The value, where there is,  is in the mind of the humans who created the<br>
"writings"... even if confused and delirant, with serious cases of double (<br>
or  multiple..) personality... <br>
<p>
I do find more of value in Hinduism and Buddhism than in<br>
<i>&gt;Christianity, </i><br>
<p>
.... they're much modester than christians ( chindren of "the king" &lt;<br>
selfprojection of their minds&gt; )<br>
<p>
but even the latter can have a good effect by encouraging a<br>
<i>&gt;loving attitude -- something that some of us could do with more of.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
*** Yes, really yes.... <br>
