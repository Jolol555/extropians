Mark Scott had an interesting guest on his Detroit radio talk show<br>
yesterday, Professor Arthur Robinson, editor of the pro-science,<br>
pro-technology, pro-free enterprise newsletter, Access to Energy.<br>
Robinson<br>
replaced Czech escapee from communism Professor Petr Beckman when<br>
Beckman<br>
died of cancer some years ago.<br>
<p>
Professor Robinson presented powerful evidence that the Establishment<br>
funded Foudations and Think Tanks have had genocidal programs<br>
operationally<br>
in place for several decades via their support for environmentalist<br>
policies and will achieve dramatically higher death rates world-wide as<br>
soon as the CO-2 treaty is implemented.  The Senate is slated to approve<br>
<p>
the treaty in December of this year.<br>
<p>
Prof. Robinson reminded the audience that malaria was almost eliminated<br>
when DDT was banned through international treaty several decades ago.<br>
Now<br>
10% of the world's population has the disease and 3-4 million people die<br>
<p>
each year from the disease.  100's of millions are made miserable.<br>
Robinson made careful studies of the raw data on which the decision was<br>
made.  Contrary to the high paid talking heads of the EPA, there was no<br>
evidence of ecological dangers from DDT.  The EPA chief Russell Train<br>
supported the DDT ban in spite of the recommendations of his top<br>
scientists!<br>
<p>
Similarly, Prof. Robinson's review of the government's raw data<br>
regarding<br>
global warming and ozone depletion indicate that these too are<br>
mythological<br>
dangers concocted solely for the purpose decreasing world population<br>
through subtle genocide.  Robinson mention that, at a recent Gorbachev<br>
Foundation meeting of environmentalist heavy hitters, the audience<br>
applauded uncontrollably when a speaker suggested reducing the planet's<br>
population by 90%!<br>
<p>
Prof. Robinson reminded the audience that everything humans need from<br>
housing to food to education to transportaion to medicine etc etc has a<br>
certain amount of energy associated with it.  Regulation CO-2 emmissions<br>
<p>
will reduce the amount of energy available per person in the world.<br>
Reducing the amount of energy available will kill people, especially in<br>
under-developed countries already starved for energy.  However, the<br>
cause<br>
and effect relationship will not be readily apparent and the genocidal<br>
Establishment will get away with it unless enough Amercans can be<br>
educated<br>
to these realities in time to stop Senate ratification of the CO-2<br>
treaty.<br>
<p>
<p>
Currently, the Senate debate centers on whether the US should sign the<br>
treaty before India and China agree to sign it.....Prof. Robinson wants<br>
to<br>
shift the debate to genocide vs. freedom and prosperity.<br>

Access to Energy Newsletter - Plus<br>
<p>
Following is an introduction to the Access to Energy Newsletter:<br>
<p>
Within days of the Chernobyl accident we warned our 6,000 readers:<br>
<p>
DON'T DRINK 63,000 GALLONS OF RAIN WATER!<br>
<p>
My name is Art Robinson. I am Professor of Chemistry at the Oregon<br>
Institute of Science and Medicine, and I publish a pro-science,<br>
pro-technology, pro-free enterprise monthly newsletter, Access to<br>
Energy,<br>
which in September 1993 began its twenty first year. Access to Energy<br>
was<br>
founded by Professor Petr Beckmann in 1973 and published by him until<br>
his<br>
death in 1993.<br>
<p>
As for those 63,000 gallons, our readers know why they are safe. We<br>
don't<br>
ask them to trust and parrot us, we ask them to think.<br>
<p>
In this case, we told them how much radioactive iodine 131 is given to a<br>
<p>
healthy patient in a thyroid check: up to 90 microcuries (a cancer<br>
patient<br>
is given much more). And we reported the maximum measured activity in<br>
rainwater washing out Chernobyl’s iodine over the US: 0.00036<br>
microcuries<br>
per liter. There is about 4 liters to the gallon; hence 63,000 gallons<br>
of<br>
"contaminated" rain water "full of fallout" will give you as much<br>
radioactive iodine as you get when you have your thyroid checked.<br>
<p>
Does that tiny grain of knowledge make you feel good?<br>
<p>
It should, because America's news media and largest periodicals don't<br>
have<br>
it. They work by the T&amp;P (trust and parrot) method. They may differ in<br>
whom<br>
to trust and parrot; but they share a common inability to evaluate. They<br>
<p>
will find two opposing viewpoints and manufacture a ‘‘controversy; "for<br>
they think objectivity lies halfway between the truth and a lie" (or<br>
worse,<br>
between two lies).<br>
<p>
In the Three Mile Island episode, Access to Energy pointed out at the<br>
time<br>
that the accident would cost more than one life per week: not from any<br>
radiation, but in the fuel cycle of the substitute power, mostly<br>
coal-fired, that had to be brought in to replace the safer and healthier<br>
<p>
way of generating electric power - nuclear power.<br>
<p>
In the Chernobyl accident, too, we pointed out that in its short life of<br>
25<br>
months, Chernobyl Unit 4 saved more lives from coal-fired pollution than<br>
it<br>
took, or will ever take, by radiation. And we gave the reasons why the<br>
Soviets will not even bother to dilute contaminated wheat with grain<br>
from<br>
elsewhere. "A little cesium and strontium will give the Russians a more<br>
varied diet; for like Markey, Solarz, Schroeder and the other<br>
antinuclear<br>
breast beaters in Congress, the Soviets care only about visible deaths."<br>
<p>
But Access to Energy is not just about nuclear energy (which is merely a<br>
<p>
very blatant target of superstition mongering). It is about the truth<br>
and<br>
how to arrive at it in scientific fields.<br>
<p>
Access to Energy readers know now, as others will find out in years to<br>
come, why the Ozone Depletion panic is little more than a hoax: they<br>
know<br>
why the layers in the high atmosphere are self-healing, why chlorine<br>
reaching the stratosphere is unlikely to come from manmade sources, why<br>
such chemically induced changes are laughably small compared with the<br>
ozone<br>
layer's natural variations with latitude and season, and why the "ozone<br>
hole" (a partial reduction of ozone concentration for 6 weeks in the<br>
antarctic fall) is more pronounced in the Antarctic, far from most CFC<br>
consumers, than in the Arctic, which is much closer to the bulk of the<br>
world's industry. The world's industry produces some 750,000 tons of<br>
chlorine in CFCs per year. The volcano Mt. Erebus (have you ever heard<br>
of<br>
it? and why not?) in the Antarctic (Ross island, Ross Sea) puts out<br>
1,000<br>
tons of chlorine every day.<br>
<p>
Access to Energy readers also know more about Global Warming than those<br>
who<br>
gobble up the media bunk. Yes, the carbon dioxide content of the<br>
atmosphere<br>
is increasing. But readers know that the link between CO2 and global<br>
temperature is flatly contradicted by the historic record. They know why<br>
<p>
the world data claiming a temperature increase over the past 150 years<br>
are<br>
inaccurate, why renowned climatologists (whom you never see on the TV<br>
screen) believe the average temperature has not changed, and that it has<br>
<p>
decreased over the last decade.<br>
<p>
Our readers know about rival theories to the greenhouse. And they know<br>
that<br>
if the greenhouse theory were correct in spite of its poor experimental<br>
record, higher temperatures would lead to more evaporation, more clouds,<br>
<p>
and less solar energy influx, and hence to a cooling of the atmosphere<br>
before equilibrium is re-established. To those who fret that we have no<br>
right to wait until we know all the data, and that we should start with<br>
countermeasures to the imminent threat now, Access to Energy readers<br>
coolly<br>
reply, "the threat of warming or of cooling?"<br>
<p>
In all other cases of irrational panic, Access to Energy gives reasons,<br>
not<br>
parroted hunches, for its conclusions; and it tells you where you can<br>
check<br>
them independently. If you think these reasons are unimportant compared<br>
with the political need of distributing research grants and humoring the<br>
<p>
sham environmentalists, support the efforts of the EPA and the State<br>
Department to ban "ozone-destroying" chemicals. If you think<br>
corporations<br>
can be taxed without passing the tax to the consumer, join Ralph Nader<br>
in<br>
soaking the rich.<br>
<p>
If you are looking for somebody to trust and parrot, get your opinions<br>
ready-made from the network newscasters and newspaper analysts, who are<br>
mostly trusting and parroting each other.<br>
<p>
But if you want to form an opinion by rational conclusion from measured<br>
data, subscribe to Access to Energy.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Access to Energy is a pro-science, pro-technology, pro-free enterprise<br>
monthly newsletter packed with information and comment on science,<br>
technology and energy - and on those who would restrict your access to<br>
it.<br>
It gives you answers based on facts with which to dispel myths. Access<br>
to<br>
Energy is now in its 21st year. Well before the Arab oil embargo in<br>
1973,<br>
Access to Energy pointed out the folly of having US energy sources<br>
controlled by medieval sheikdoms.<br>
<p>
In 1980, amidst Carter's confusion about the "energy crisis," it<br>
reported<br>
on the coming oil glut.<br>
<p>
Access to Energy was the only voice in the country pointing to the dead<br>
of<br>
Three Mile Island: for six years, one person a week was dying from the<br>
effects of the substitute power that had to be brought in to replace the<br>
<p>
far safer power from nuclear reactors. Access to Energy explains the<br>
true<br>
nature of nuclear wastes: minute in quantity, temporary in toxicity (in<br>
500<br>
years they are less toxic than the coal ash from the same delivered<br>
electric energy), the first type of waste completely removable from the<br>
biosphere, they are a revolution in public health. Fossil-fired wastes<br>
amount to an annual one billion tons, and some of these wastes are<br>
disposed<br>
of in people's lungs.<br>
<p>
The radioactive dangers of energy conservation via high levels radon gas<br>
<p>
(see below for the benefits of low levels) have only in the last few<br>
years<br>
been given publicity by the media and the government. Access to Energy<br>
has<br>
been writing about them since 1980. Access to Energy explains why<br>
radiation<br>
cannot make food radioactive. It is safer than other types of food<br>
preservation.<br>
<p>
Access to Energy defends science against superstition outside energy,<br>
too.<br>
It explains why today's genetic engineering takes far smaller risks than<br>
<p>
when, millennia ago, grass was ‘‘engineered’’ into wheat. Ozone layer?<br>
Greenhouse? EMFs from power lines and video terminals? In short, get<br>
Access<br>
to Energy, the UNbrainwash.<br>
<p>
Access to Energy is fiercely independent: it takes no advertising, no<br>
subsidies, no dips into taxpayers’ money. It doesn't theorize about the<br>
free market: it practices it.<br>
<p>
Access to Energy costs only $35 for 12 monthly issues. Why so little,<br>
when<br>
the others cost $95 and even more? Because Access to Energy's renewal<br>
rate,<br>
consistently month after month, is 80% or more. (Yes, eighty!) It gets<br>
most<br>
of its publicity free and unsolicited: it is mentioned and recommended<br>
by<br>
national journals (Commentary, National Review, Conservative Digest,<br>
Reason, American Spectator, Policy Review, and others), by famous<br>
scientists and well known congressmen - but above all, by its readers.<br>

Access to Energy PLUS<br>
<p>
During the past ten months Access to Energy has published detailed<br>
articles<br>
giving the evidence that:<br>
<p>
- Carbon dioxide is not only not warming up the earth's atmosphere, it<br>
is<br>
causing explosive increases in the numbers of plants and animals. Carbon<br>
<p>
dioxide release is the most beneficial effect that man has ever had upon<br>
<p>
the plant and animal environment. Did you know, for example, that the<br>
mass<br>
of trees in the United States has already increased more than 25% and,<br>
during the next century, is going to double as a result of carbon<br>
dioxide<br>
release?<br>
<p>
- The recent ozone scare over Toronto was caused by unprofessional<br>
interpretation of the effects of a volcanic eruption and had nothing<br>
whatever to do with CFC emissions. We call this sort of misinformation<br>
"cargo cult science." Armed with the facts in our January 1994 issue,<br>
you<br>
will understand unscrupulous politicians who are forcing the American<br>
people to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in an entirely<br>
unnecessary<br>
ban of CFCs like freon.<br>
<p>
- Radon and other sources of low level radiation actually decrease your<br>
risk of cancer. This reduction can be as great as the increase from<br>
cigarette smoking. Current Environmental Protection Agency attempts to<br>
lower radon levels in homes may, if successful, actually cause as many<br>
as<br>
75,000 American lung cancer deaths.<br>
<p>
- Revolutionary safer and more productive methods of power generation by<br>
<p>
nuclear fission can be developed. The October and December 1993 issues<br>
of<br>
Access to Energy contain articles by Edward Teller and by Sam Cohen<br>
describing two of these methods.<br>
<p>
- The Clinton medical plan is nothing less than, as we call it, "The<br>
Euthanasia Act of 1994." The November 1993 Access to Energy tells why<br>
the<br>
Wall Street Journal recently said of this plan, "Our advice is, keep a<br>
good<br>
grip on your wallet, and if anything like the Clinton plan ever passes,<br>
don't get sick."<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Each issue of Access to Energy contains new information with complete<br>
references to scientific literature. We seldom repeat ourselves. If you<br>
want the full story on these recent and timely articles in Access to<br>
Energy, we will send you:<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
