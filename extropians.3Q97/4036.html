The meta-invisible hand: self-organized criticality and politics<br>
<p>
I have no desire to participate in the debate about the market<br>
versus the state. I have heard it before, and frankly I prefer to<br>
spend my mental resources at more creative problems. Here is <br>
an idea which may however have some bearing on the debate.<br>
<p>
I think it was originally formulated by the fictional "Invisible<br>
Hand Society" mentioned in Robert Anton Wilson's Schrödinger's Cat<br>
Trilogy: the "invisible hand" acts not just on the market, but<br>
also on politics as a whole. If the market is very free, undesirable<br>
factors (such as unemployment, inequalities or people treated<br>
badly by companies) will tend to push it in the direction of<br>
greater government interference and give power to unions. On the other<br>
hand, if the government is too strong, it will become inefficient,<br>
bureaucratic and be perceived as repressive, which will strengthen<br>
pro-market forces, pushing for freedom. So the end result is that<br>
the "meta-invisible hand" will lead to a balanced politics somewhere<br>
between the free market and a government-run economy.<br>
<p>
It is interesting to note that this description strongly suggests<br>
self-organized criticality, where political changes scale according<br>
to a power-law (small changes in policy are common, larger less<br>
common, according to a (size)^-constant law). If Kauffman is to<br>
be believed, this may in general be a state of maximal diversity<br>
and maximal fitness: a lot of competing systems exist, but none<br>
will get totally dominant; none of them are obviously flawed and<br>
all have positive aspects. If Kauffman is right, it might even<br>
be possible to predict the ideal range of freedom-security that<br>
societies tend to converge to. <br>
<p>
It is worth noting that the system can stagnate into an attractor,<br>
at least if it is small. If the system is small it can easily get<br>
trapped in a one-policy state since for few actors, the number<br>
of actors supporting a certain policy will be small and random<br>
fluctuations will hence be comparatively stronger than in a <br>
many actor system. This makes "extinction" of policies likelier,<br>
and after a while only one remains. If the system is large <br>
enough this is counteracted by both the number of new<br>
mutations and the larger number of agents supporting most policies<br>
(note that there are still plenty of small policies that are<br>
likely to quickly go extinct, a kind of political undergrowth). <br>
The size where this happens likely depends on how the policies<br>
co-evolve and the kind of interactions that take place. <br>
<p>
One problem is that even if policy fitness is maximized, it <br>
doesn't necessarily maximize human happiness or growth. Neither<br>
a free market or a strong state will make people happy, and<br>
the self-organization process will not do that until<br>
human happiness becomes the determining factor of the memetic<br>
fitness of policies. This suggests the need for a new <br>
economic and political system, an extension of the policy<br>
space in a new direction. The goal should be to create a new <br>
self-organized critical state (which is flexible and avoids<br>
stagnation) where human extropy is maximized. How to do<br>
this is left as an exercise for the memetic complexity engineering<br>
student.<br>
