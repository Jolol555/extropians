<i>&gt;self-organization </i><br>
<p>
	Growing self-organization is what sophisticated conspiracy theorists mean<br>
by conspiracy.....why keep arguing against staw men?  Why not argue with<br>
the ideas actually being proposed here and now?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;between different parties who notice they gain when</i><br>

<i>&gt;create a cartel. </i><br>
<p>
	But, there is some centralized planning none-the-less.  Remember, the most<br>
powerful forces on Wall Street sent their representatives to plan the<br>
Federal Reserve cartel in secret at Jeckyl Island Georgia in 1913.  Paul<br>
Warburg (Daddy Warbucks) had reviewed the history of Central Banking<br>
cartels prior to the meeting and presented his results.  The shadowy<br>
figures travelled to the train station in disguise and under false names to<br>
avoid the press.  They came to an agreement and then sold their agenda<br>
covertly "as a populist measure to limit the power of Wall Street"!  The<br>
Jeckyll Island "conspiracy" is well documented in the autobiographies of<br>
several of the attendees.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"Designed" conspiracies ("Psst, want to rule the world?") seems to</i><br>
<i>&gt;work much less well than "grown" conspiracies ("Thank God for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;anti-nuclear activists, now we can sell more oil. Give them some</i><br>
<i>&gt;money, would you?")</i><br>
<p>
	And, now that we see their usefulness, let's have our Foundations take<br>
over the anti-Nuclear movement lock stock and barell, re-organized them<br>
with acceptable leaders, etc. etc.  CONSPIRACY<br>
<p>
, and everybody seems to overestimate their<br>
<i>&gt;efficiency and prevalence (because it is untestable: if you see a</i><br>
<i>&gt;failed conspiracy, then there might be a dozen successul conspiracies</i><br>
<i>&gt;behind your back, and if you can not find any large conspiracies it</i><br>
<i>&gt;must be because they are good at hiding).</i><br>
<p>
	No one said the scientific method was easy to apply to the study of<br>
society, and extremely complex phenomenon.<br>
<p>
	However, conspiracy theories are no more untestable than any other theory<br>
of history.  And people do attempt to test them...pefectly cotnrolled<br>
experiments, of course, are possible only to the rich and powerful in a<br>
position try a conspiratorial strategy and see if it works...those using<br>
the scientific method outside a conspiracy can only only look for data that<br>
would tend to support or deny the theory and then make a reasonable<br>
judgement....<br>
