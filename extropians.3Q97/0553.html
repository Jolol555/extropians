No, this was shown in the `Millennium' episode *literally* with a<br>
lead-balls-on-wire orrery, O-------, then `confirmed' by good ole Frank<br>
firing up the net and getting the planets strung out on the screen, away<br>
from the sun, making a straight line pointing at... the mote in God's eye,<br>
maybe.  Common sense told me that if anything *this* wonderful-looking was<br>
on the cards, every astronomer in town would be crowing about the<br>
2001-style spectacle, and every fruitcake would be howling abt the<br>
apocalypse and the world flipping over.  Then danny's post arrived in the<br>
nick of time to show that I was right about that, at any rate, even when<br>
all the silly little bits of dirt and gas are up to is roughly tumbling<br>
along in the south-east half of the field.  Aw shit, people.  (Or am I<br>
missing the smiley here somewhere?)<br>
