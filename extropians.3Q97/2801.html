<i>&gt; &gt; I have no problem with any publication doing whatever it wants...I'm a huge</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; adherent to the principles of the Free Market...But I think there should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; some honesty and integrety...The writing that I have read of Rifkin are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Luddite...or so my impression...for SA to lend credibillity to him decreases</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; their own  already lessened credibility  in my view.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In fairness to Sci Am I should mention that the article was a fairly </i><br>
<i>&gt; evenhanded depiction of Rifkin, that didn't explicitly, or implicitly</i><br>
<i>&gt; as far as I could tell,</i><br>
<i>&gt; endorse his views. Anyone interested in science needs to be aware of</i><br>
<i>&gt; those who oppose it.  I found it a useful article b/c I know </i><br>
<i>&gt; very little about Rifkin, though I don't think the article in question</i><br>
<i>&gt; presented the whole picture.  </i><br>
<p>
But the fact that they were apparently "evenhanded" is itself a ringing<br>
endorsement; they chose to portray him seriously, rather than deriding<br>
him entirely as a crackpot, as any rational scientist would.<br>
<p>
It doesn't surprize me; SciAm has been a propaganda rag for a long time.<br>
