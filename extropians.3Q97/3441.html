By DEFINITION fascism is private ownership of production...State Control <br>
of same.<br>

The US is a fascist economy....only no one wants (mostly no <br>
one...certain libertarians are getting huffy to admit it.<br>
<p>
Of course in a true 'Darwinian Economy' optimising use of resources <br>
would mean elimination all non-productive individuals (like ants). After <br>
that all individuals that aren't productive enough given their <br>
consumption of limited recources. So after we kill all physically- or <br>
metally chalanged, unemployed and elderly we give IQ-test to all 5-year <br>
olds, score below 110? Kill them to. Then up the minimum by .5 point per <br>
year. Combined with automation of simpler work we should see some <br>
dramatic increase in the standard of living of smart, hardworking <br>
people. Very optimal, very efficient.<br>
=========================================================<br>
<p>
Actually, based on many peoples response to Holly' post's, they in the <br>
goodness of their hearts dont want to kill the poor wrethes - just make <br>
them work harder damn it!  Didn't you know its for their own good?  If <br>
the poor wretches aren't working hard, then they will become <br>
disinfrachnised and loose their dignity.  All I have to say to that is - <br>
Bullshit!<br>
<p>
If hard work is what gives people dignity - then we should put all the <br>
rich people back to work, so they can regain some of *their* dignity <br>
too!<br>
<p>
Okay everybody - back to work!<br>
<p>
