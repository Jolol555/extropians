<i>&gt; From: John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;**Yes** we do have a immigration problem. Thanks to the pinky   </i><br>
     <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;government policies the country is being *flooded* by poor      </i><br>
<i>     &gt;         &gt;immigrants         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;from all corners of the world </i><br>
<i>&gt;            </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So what? The problem is not the immigrants but the welfare system they &gt;</i><br>
find when they get there. <br>
I agree, the welfare system is the main cause, the (illegal) immigrants are<br>
the symptom. I don't blame *them*, we'd probably do the same if we were in<br>
their position. As usual, the blame lies with the politicians and (thus)<br>
with the people who elected them  (btw, I don't vote).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If a country draws a line around its borders and says </i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone who is inside that line gets all sorts of nifty financial benefits</i><br>
but <br>
<i>&gt; anyone outside that line does not, then free immigration can not be &gt;</i><br>
allowed. <br>
That's the way *rational* people would do it...Besides, many of the<br>
immigrants are "illegal", but the government lacks the willpower and<br>
the popular support to take some firm action. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think free immigration is a basic human right </i><br>
Free immigration could only function in a world with a fairly (culturally,<br>
economically etc.) homogenous population.<br>
<i>&gt; and that's one of many &gt; reasons </i><br>
<i>&gt; I oppose welfare. Fortunately it's becoming increasingly difficult to</i><br>
stop <br>
<i>&gt; people from going where they want to go or hearing what they want to &gt;</i><br>
hear, <br>
<i>&gt; and that's why I'm optimistic the present system is breaking down.</i><br>
<p>
It may very well be breaking down (slowly), but what will replace it?<br>
Whatever it is, it's probably not much better, if not worse. You seem<br>
to forget that most people aren't "rational libertarian entities", and will<br>
be attracted to the more "extreme" solutions if the situation gets worse. <br>
I think the last major war is a fine example of that...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;especially Turks, Moroccans which will probably result in Islam </i><br>
       <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;becoming the number one religion after the turn of the century </i><br>
<i>&gt;            </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So what? True, Islam is an idiotic religion, but no more so than the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Christian religion, or the Jewish, or the Hindu, or the Druid, or the</i><br>
UFO, <br>
<i>&gt; or the ...</i><br>
No western country, and certainly not Holland, is ruled by theocrats.<br>
State and society are pretty secular. Islam on the other hand is very much<br>
alive and omnipresent in Islamic states. Go live in Iran, and feel the<br>
difference!           <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;*They* breed a lot faster than "we" do. </i><br>
<i>&gt;            </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Who is "we"?  I'm not Dutch. </i><br>
Are you sure? You're sounding like one of our socialists :)<br>
"We" are the Caucasians (oh, it's that ugly word again) in general. Most<br>
"western" countries have either stagnant or even deminishing populations<br>
(-growth), which would be *great* if _all_ ethnic groups did this. As we<br>
all<br>
know, they don't (for cultural/religious reasons). Even this wouldn't be so<br>
bad (just a little overpopulation and related problems), if they had a<br>
belief<br>
system that would resemble our (19th century liberal) model, which values<br>
things like freedom and progress (*no*, we're not perfect either, but<br>
western<br>
societies are generally a better place to live in than say the Arab<br>
countries,<br>
and if there *is* going to be a singularity, it will be a direct result of<br>
the<br>
Euro-American effort and the values that (however compromised) are <br>
associated with these cultures). Try promoting the extropian principles<br>
in the Middle East or Africa etc, and see how far you'll get...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;I guess we all know what happens to tolerance, progress and</i><br>
liberal         <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;ideas in general when Islam takes over...)</i><br>
<i>&gt;            </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Things change, nothing is fixed in concrete. Historically Islam has been</i><br>
much  <br>
<i>&gt; more tolerant of foreign ideas than Christianity, it's only in this</i><br>
century  <br>
<i>&gt; that things changed. They can change again. </i><br>
Yes, they can change either way. But the way it looks *now*, it's "bye,<br>
bye singularity" when the Muslims take over. <br>
Do you really care so little about your future and freedom? <br>
The only reason why *some* none-western countries are "keeping up<br>
appearances" when it comes to technological progress and human rights<br>
etc. is because of massive western support/pressure. I really doubt it<br>
whether civilization as we know it (let alone something more advanced)<br>
would hold if Europe and the USA totally collapsed. What do you think?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I must say, if you attach a vast significance to the trivial little </i><br>
<i>&gt; differences in culture or physical appearance among various groups of</i><br>
humans <br>
<i>&gt; today, then you will be as unprepared as most people for the phase change</i><br>
in <br>
<i>&gt; life of truly astronomical magnitude that will happen in less than a</i><br>
century.<br>
I don't care about physical appearance, and the "trivial little differences<br>
<p>
in culture" are the differences between life and death, extropy and<br>
entropy,<br>
singularity or dark ages, freedom or slavery etc. <br>
                                                      <br>
<i>&gt; BTW, I assume by "liberal" you're using the 19'th century meaning</i><br>
Indeed.<br>
<p>
I don't care what the others do, as long as they do it *after* I'm<br>
offplanet.<br>
