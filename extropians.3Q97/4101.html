hmmm....methinks I am being a bit swayed by *some* of John Clark's<br>
thoughts on self...<br>
 <br>

I think JK would agree with me on this point: Yes.  If you are exact<br>
copies, and continue to be so, you would have exactly the same thoughts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  And if not, why not?  What</i><br>

<p>
I would say location. (I think JK would disagree)  To use a computer<br>
programming analogy, I would say you are two identical instances of the<br>
same object. You are linked by similarity but not location.(in the same<br>
way that two identical instances of an object would be stored in different<br>
locations in a computer's memory)<br>
<p>
Here's a musical analogy(in case you're not computer literate) : the same<br>
group of notes repeated in an opus are different only in location.  From<br>
this difference, there is the difference in context between the two groups<br>
of notes.  In human terms, this would be the difference between you and<br>
your exact copy in the Andromeda galaxy.  You are the same, but you have<br>
different *potentials*.  If you head out into space, and so does your<br>
copy, you have the potential to encounter different stars.<br>
