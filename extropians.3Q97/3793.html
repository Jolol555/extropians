Rick: <br>
<p>
I try to concentrate on the interesting examples. :)<br>
<p>
The Somalian situation is another case where "cultural relativism", in the<br>
sense that some people use it, i.e. "all cultures are equal", really sets<br>
my teeth on edge. <br>
<p>
Saying it's OK for Somalian warlords to be the way they are because they've<br>
been that way for thousands of years ("that way" meaning "hard bastards",<br>
in a culture where being a "hard bastard" is held up as an ideal just the<br>
way "anyone can be President" is held up in the USA)--only now they've got<br>
Western-style "force multipliers" like jeeps, armor plate and full-auto<br>
firearms, so they can starve *even more* people, hoard _even more_ loot<br>
than they ever used to be able to... Well, it boggles my mind.<br>
<p>
So does shipping emergency aid in such a way as to virtually guarantee it<br>
won't get to the people who need it, which is the way aid programs are<br>
almost always run.<br>
<p>
So does thinking that one can _convince_ the "hard bastards" to change<br>
their stripes en masse by _reasoning with them about what's fair_ for a few<br>
hours every once in a while.<br>
<p>
I am not convinced that any intervention less than forced, or funded (i.e.,<br>
"baby buying", illegal here but (ironically) accepted in parts of the third<br>
world) exportation &amp; adoption of the next generation of Somalian children<br>
would "work"... even then there might turn out to be a partially-heritable<br>
disposition to what we in this world might call antisocial behavior. <br>
<p>
And I'm not proposing such exo-adoption. Just pointing out that "give a man<br>
a fish" doesn't even work if all the man will do with the fish is throw it<br>
on the ground, even if his starving child _might_ have eaten it... :\<br>
<p>
_Engineer Peace_(a service mark of C-CAL). Don't just visualize it. Eliezer<br>
is trying, I'm trying; I suspect GBurch is trying. <br>
<p>
I like diversity, but diversity like _suttee_? I don't think so.<br>
<p>
Just call me a bleeding-heart libertarian.<br>

<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     I find this to be an interesting example because of its philosophical </i><br>
<i>&gt;     implications (sucker for a good quandry). To the question, "Do </i><br>
<i>&gt;     cultures have rights or do people?" I must ask, if people are </i><br>
<i>&gt;     programmed to believe a certain thing and that is all they can </i><br>
<i>&gt;     comprehend (without sufficient time and communication to change their </i><br>
<i>&gt;     thinking) is their perception more important than their physical life? </i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;     certain and immediate result, should we not intervene with cultures </i><br>
<i>&gt;     who have the same lacking?  </i><br>
<p>
The problem here is the tarlike nature of "intervention" as currently<br>
practiced. What I think of as intervention and what Hillary Clinton (or<br>
Janet "Easy-Bake" Reno) thinks of as intervention are two very different<br>
things.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Logically, would we not want a superior </i><br>
<i>&gt;     off-world culture to intervene had an event like the Cold War </i><br>
<i>&gt;     substantially heated up?</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure. That's why I still watch _The Day the Earth Stood Still_.<br>
(Brrr.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     I'm not a fervent believer in the Prime Directive as you can tell...</i><br>
<p>
Neither was TMA-0. :)<br>
