     Haven't read Daniel Quinn...have to look him up...but I think that he <br>
     may be refering to something else..from your context..<br>

     A shepard would be a maker...as he  produces (makes) a legitimate <br>
     service or product...<br>

     Rick Knight further elaborates:<br>
     <br>
     Daniel Quinn has three books by my counting, the first "Providence" is <br>
     an autobiographical tale of how the author attempted to become a <br>
     Trappist monk.  <br>
     <br>
     The second, and most popular, is "Ishmael" about a telepathic, <br>
     super-intelligent gorilla who is the mentor for a disillusioned man in <br>
     his mid-life crisis.  The characters and plot are a springboard for <br>
     Quinn's beliefs on human history which I don't mean to trivialize at <br>
     all.  They are fascinating and worthy of consideration.<br>
     <br>
     The latest, "The Story of B" is about a young American Catholic priest <br>
     who is sent on a mission to investigate a man called "B" who, by his <br>
     speaking, is stirring up a lot of controversy and gathering a hefty <br>
     following around Europe.  Again, the same notions of the author are <br>
     conveyed using a narrative plot convention.<br>
     <br>
     Quinn has a web page (www.bnetwork.com) I think.  He seems to be <br>
     pretty well read on history and anthropology.  He has divided the <br>
     people of the world into leavers (environmentally passive) and takers <br>
     (environmentally exploitive).  He's an advocate of balance for the <br>
     sake of long term human sustainability.<br>
     <br>
     I would regard a third world shepherd as a leaver, a western world <br>
     rancher as a taker.  The distinction being on their overall impact on <br>
     the world at large.  The shepherd's flock might eat up the grass in a <br>
     meadow which locally may locally impact the population but a modern <br>
     cattle facility can spoil groundwater and produce over abundant <br>
     amounts of methane, not to mention how much grain it takes to feed the <br>
     cattle that one doesn't get back nutritionally or substantively in the <br>
     resultant meat or dairy consumption for which the cattle are raised.<br>
