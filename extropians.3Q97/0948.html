                    Teacher says she'll plead guilty to child<br>
                    rape<br>
<p>
                    by Ronald K. Fitten<br>
                    Seattle Times staff reporter<br>
<p>
                    A former elementary-school teacher who had an affair<br>
                    with a 13-year-old boy said yesterday she plans to<br>
                    plead guilty next month to two counts of second-degree <br>
                    rape of a child.<br>
<p>
                    Mary Kay LeTourneau burst into tears outside the<br>
                    courtroom when asked why she plans to plead guilty.<br>
                    She left without commenting.<br>
<p>
                    LeTourneau, 35, was arrested in March and charged with<br>
                    child rape for allegedly having numerous sexual<br>
                    encounters with her former  student. She had taught<br>
                    the boy, now 14, in the second and sixth<br>
                    grades. He was a student at Cascade Middle School in<br>
                    the Highline School District during the period of<br>
                    their alleged sexual involvement.<br>
<p>
                    The Normandy Park woman, who taught sixth grade at<br>
                    Shorewood Elementary in Burien, said through her<br>
                    attorney that she would enter the guilty plea Aug. 7<br>
                    at the Regional Justice Center in Kent.<br>
<p>
                    She could be sentenced to up to seven years in prison.<br>
                    Her attorney, David Gehrke, said that as part of her<br>
                    plea, he will try to convince the prosecution and the<br>
                    sentencing judge that LeTourneau instead should<br>
                    receive treatment.<br>
<p>
                    Gehrke said he hopes she will be allowed to<br>
                    participate in the state-operated Special Sex Offender <br>
                    Alternative (SSOA) program, considered the most<br>
                    restrictive available to sex offenders.<br>
<p>
                    Gehrke said LeTourneau has been evaluated by two<br>
                    state-certified sexual-deviancy counselors whose<br>
                    recommendations will be sent to a probation officer,<br>
                    who will recommend whether she should be<br>
                    considered for the program. If she is allowed to<br>
                    participate, treatment would continue for at least<br>
                    three years.<br>
<p>
                    The attorney said that other conditions of a plea<br>
                    agreement could require her to serve up to six months<br>
                    in jail, have no contact with the victim for 10 years<br>
                    and no unsupervised contact with any children,<br>
                    including her own, without permission from her<br>
                    probation officer and her treatment counselor.<br>
<p>
&lt;/quote&gt;<br>

Supplementary information:<br>
--------------------------<br>
<p>
The boy in the case has no complaints-- Ms. Letourneus was 'grassed' by <br>
two relatives, it seems.  No-one in the case alleges any harm to anyone -- <br>
except to the accused herself.  She currerntly faces a choice between up <br>
to twnty years in jail as a 'child rapist', the loss of her own family, <br>
and/or forced attendace for brainwashing sesssions, 'aversion therapy' (an <br>
oxymoron) etc.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
Lisa Johnson is the Prosecutor at the 'Regional Justice Centre' at Kent, <br>
Seattle, WA (206-205-7400).  She has a voice like iron, and is a Legal <br>
Positivist (i.e. the 'law' is whatever the State says it is -- the legal <br>
doctrine which broght the world the USSR and Nazi Germany).<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
Norm Maleng is the ( elected -- Republican ) Chief Prosecutor. There's an <br>
entry for him in Covert Action Information Bulletin (http;//www.pir.org).<br>
He's on 206-285-3389.  Somerthing to do with the Imelda Marcos regime's <br>
inaptly-named 'intelligence' death squads killing two longshoremen of <br>
local 37 in Seattle, within the US itself...  <br>
<p>
There's a US$ 15 000 000 civil judgment still outstanding in the case. It <br>
seems that some death squad members somehow got away...<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
<p>
Interestingly, the hideous 'demonstration' killers of young JonBenet Ramsey in <br>
Colorado left a note with a sign-off 'Victory, SBTC' -- believed to be a <br>
reference to 'SUBIC BAY TRAINING CENTRE' -- the non-defunct US Naval base <br>
in the Philippines.  <br>
<p>
I'm an external adviser to the Boulder, Colorado District Attorney's <br>
office in the case, BTW.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
Norm Maleng's Deputy is one Dan Satterberg, another 'voice of iron' and <br>
another Legal Positivist -- 206-296-9067.  <br>
<p>
In addition to being indifferent to Ms. Letourneur, Dan Satterberg seems <br>
completely indifferent to massive criminal law violations on his own <br>
doorstep, relating to the issue of 'backdoors' inserted into Windows95 by <br>
Microsoft Corporation based in Seattle -- violations which should wipe <br>
Microsoft out for violating Federal Laws (including the _Nation Security <br>
Agency's Charter_, which directly obligates NSA to protect the computer <br>
security and the copnstitutional rights of of all US citizens), <br>
obligations to Windows95 customers and directly prejudicing the security <br>
of NATO itself-- _the backdoor access routines have been 'hacked_.'<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
 JonBenet Ramsey's father John Bennett Ramsey's billion-dollar company <br>
(Access Graphics) works with Larry Ellison and Oracle as a prime <br>
contractor on Network Internet Termimals; Oracle is a key Microsoft rival <br>
and marketplace alternative.  Their chosen Operating sustem has no <br>
trapdoors and backdoors). This unlikely to endear them to some governemt <br>
officials involve with the Windoze95 scam.<br>
