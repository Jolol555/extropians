Cease!<br>
<p>
John K. Clark, your defense is appreciated.  Thank you.<br>
However, this threatens to become a flame war.  If you respond, please do so<br>
off the list, as I am doing.  I don't believe Mcelligott said anything that<br>
would be taken seriously enough to require a response, particularly<br>
considering your relative tenure as Extropians.<br>
<p>
Mcelligott:<br>
Thank you for pointing out that I used fighting words.  This I noticed, albeit<br>
too late.  I consider myself lucky that I made that mistake over the Internet<br>
rather than in person.  I have a saying:  I can make any mistake, as long as I<br>
only make it once.<br>
<p>
I suggest that *both* of you learn from this and not repeat my mistake.<br>
Thank you.<br>
<p>
Mcelligott should have quoted the crash-phrase rather than the tears-phrase<br>
in his reply.  A lot of people thought he was saying that sentimentality<br>
would get me held upside-down over the toilet.  It did seem like a bit of a<br>
non-sequitur; I had no idea what he was talking about.<br>
<p>
The part about being 18, I am responding to off the list.<br>
(He's in trouble...)<br>
