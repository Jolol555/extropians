It is strange that libertarians - who should have a grasp of the nature<br>
of spontaneous orders and the nature of civil society - should somehow<br>
see an unwritten constitution - like Britain's as somehow less real or<br>
effective than a written one.  And it is certainly not just<br>
"politicians" who refer to our constitution - it's the subject of<br>
countless academic books and courses. (To be perfectly accurate, of<br>
course, one should add that parts of the British constitution are indeed<br>
written).  Walter Bagehot's The English Constituion (Kegan, Paul,<br>
Trench, Trubner, London, 1867; 2nd edn, 1872/Oxford University Press,<br>
1928/Fontana Library, Collins, London, 1963) is still worth reading.<br>
(Bagehot was a classical liberal at the conservative end of the liberal<br>
spectrum). Also still worth reading is W. Ivor Jennings, The Law and the<br>
Constitution (University of London Press, 1933). George Burton Adams,<br>
Constitutional History of England (Jonathan Cape, London, 1921; 2nd edn,<br>
revised by Robert L. Schulyer - who was also a classical liberal - 1935)<br>
is good and has an implicitly classical liberal slant.  Harold<br>
Stannard's The Two Constitutions: A Comparative Study of the British and<br>
American Constitutional Systems (Adam &amp; Charles Black, London, 1949) is<br>
also indispensible.  A more recent study (by a conservative) of the<br>
state of the British constitution is Philip Norton, The Constitution in<br>
Flux, Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1982.<br>
<p>
My own essay "The Case Against a Bill of Rights", South African Freedom<br>
Review, 2(2), Summer 1989, pp. 19-33 (photocopy available from me at the<br>
address below for $1 in US cash) provides a good (in my view!)<br>
discussion of why what is really imortant to preserve liberty is the<br>
nature of the civil society and its "deep structures" of belief and<br>
social practice/tradition. What is written in a constitution (eg the<br>
quite liberal constitution of the old USSR, or the current US<br>
constitution for that matter) is far less important in<br>
creating/preserving liberty than the constituion of society itself.   <br>
