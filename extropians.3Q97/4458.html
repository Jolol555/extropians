<p>
I think the "outsiders" is only a distraction. This is true in both<br>
problems, but is especially clear in the copying problem. In the copying<br>
experiment, at no time does the subject place any positive probability on<br>
himself being an outsider, so the number of outsiders cannot possibly be<br>
relevant. As an analogy, consider picking a ball from an urn blindfolded. <br>
If you are told that the ball you picked is not red, then it cannot matter<br>
how many red balls there were in the urn. In other words, the probability<br>
of any statement concerning the ball conditioning on the ball not being<br>
red remains the same if you alter the experiment by changing the number of<br>
red balls originally in the urn. Similarly, the subject's conditional<br>
probabilities given that he is not an outsider cannot change if the number<br>
of outsiders changes. <br>
<p>
In your God's coin tosses experiment, the odds should be exactly 10:1 no<br>
matter how many outsiders there are. Let H be "the coin showed head" and C<br>
be "I was created as a result of the coin toss." P(H|C)/P(not<br>
H|C)=P(C|H)P(H)/(P(C|not H)P(not H)). In your calculations, you assume<br>
that P(H)=P(not H). But as I argued in the copying problem, and I think it<br>
is true in this problem also, P(H)!=P(not H) given the subject's state of<br>
knowledge after the coin toss. As a result P(H|C)/P(not H|C) is exactly<br>
10 even though P(C|H)/P(C|not H) only approaches 10 asymptoticly as the<br>
number of outsiders goes to infinity.<br>
