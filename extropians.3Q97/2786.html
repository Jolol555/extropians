<i>&gt; I have now received strong suggestions, from two separate and distinct</i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals, that the term "black goo" is prejudicial to persons reflecting</i><br>
<i>&gt; certain spectra of light....</i><br>
<p>
Don't let a few intolerant listeners prevent you from using simple,<br>
clear language.  Empathy is a handy skill--I have nothing against it--<br>
but language is far more imporant.  In the English language and<br>
American culture, "black" carries the connotations of death, and its<br>
use in that context is easily understood and entirely appropriate.<br>
If I have any objection to the term it is linguistic, not political:<br>
in the Chinese language and culture, for example, white is the color<br>
associated with death, so the term "black goo" won't translate well<br>
into that culture.<br>
<p>
If you are simply coining nonce terms for particular species of nano-<br>
creatures under discussion to simplify the discussion, then I find it<br>
quite a useful and powerful tool to associate them with something like<br>
color, which is a simple physical phenomenon we can relate to, and has<br>
useful connotations in the laguage in which the discussion is taking<br>
place.  If you mean the terms to be more permanent, then perhaps longer<br>
and more specific names would be better.<br>
<p>
An association that might have been deliberately offensive enough to<br>
justify avoiding in speech would have been to use groups of people<br>
directly, rather than indirectly by association with color (e.g.,<br>
Nazi Goo, Swiss Goo, French Goo), but colors are just colors.  Even<br>
in this case, it would be better to use offensive-but-clear terms if<br>
they really were clear than to risk ambiguity.  Tolerance is an<br>
obligation /only/ of listeners, not speakers.  The obligations of a<br>
speaker are clarity and honesty above all else.<br>
