Interesting thread, Elieser.<br>
<p>
Several points and then I'll spout my thoughts on How It Should Be Done:<br>
(sorry if this is a long post; I need to get across one complete, coherent <br>
concept, a pet of mine :-) )<br>
<p>
Do you really believe that positive, radical change in the constitution of<br>
the US could happen?  It would be a madhouse in any event.  And you'd be<br>
up against hoards of professional thieves (politicians, lobbyists, etc). <br>
I prefer to think about what could be done if starting out fresh in a new<br>
"place", physical or virtual, a blank slate. <br>
<p>
Yes! re: a limited number of words in the constitution.<br>
No!  re: representitives.  With modern communications, we will not need <br>
these laggards.<br>
<p>
Re: state government, in the current system, this is one of the reasons <br>
that the US gov. is still somewhat tolerable.  It traps people with <br>
political ambitions at the lowest, least effective level, and presents <br>
many layers of trap for them.  This is the primary function of <br>
government, IMHO.  I asked a friend who had been a local San Diego <br>
politician, and who had almost won a Ca. state office, about this, and he <br>
agreed.  He said (paraphrasing) "It takes all of the effort you can muster <br>
and then more, to play the game, at any level of government".<br>
<p>
First, I think one would need to establish the basis, the reason for <br>
being, of government.  In this group alone there will be much <br>
disagreement on that.  I believe that some government is needed, because <br>
in its absence, a fraction of the population will gain control over the <br>
rest, and become the "government", in any event.<br>
<p>
That assumes that we can still be killed, or our stuff stolen or <br>
destroyed, or our livlihood seriosly hampered by others.  Among <br>
Extropians, of course, that is not assumed!  But: otherwise, we have no <br>
basis for talking about constitutions, so I'll assume it will still be so.<br>
<p>
So we must decide to agree to live by a certain constitution, when in a <br>
particular "country".  Everybody lives by the same (limited set of) rules, <br>
in this place, so we can manage not to kill, steal from, or harm each other.<br>
<p>
And with a particular government (or lack thereof) in control of those<br>
laws and of enforcing them.<br>
<p>
Note that I'm saying that the individual can choose not to comply, but <br>
not here: if you won't live "with" us, you can't come in.  That alone <br>
would be impossible to enforce in the US, there is nowhere to deport <br>
those that don't agree, to.  Hence the blank slate is needed.<br>
<p>
Here is the concept: On arriving at a port of entry, you are presented <br>
with a copy of the constitution.  You must read it, and prove you <br>
understand it, and sign your agreement to live by this document while in <br>
the country.  Before entering.  This agreement is the moral basis for <br>
enforcing all laws.  Ultimately, if you are convicted of seriously violating <br>
the law, you are spaced - as it were - back the way you came.  Mabye <br>
we'll let you keep your spacesuit. ;-}<br>
<p>
So, the constitution, which includes all laws, and other information<br>
needed to define a government, must be short enough for many people to<br>
understand and remember.  I think in any event, the real government of a<br>
place is a collective set of beliefs, especially the beliefs of those "in" <br>
government.  We need to get in sync, to sing the same peacefull tune.<br>
<p>
This implys a lot of liberty, and a miniarchist government, anything <br>
more complicated, and you could not get enough people agreeing on it and <br>
understanding it.<br>
<p>
Few or no fixed points to the constitution, all is up for change by <br>
direct voting of citizens: anything else implys that a few "founders" <br>
have the right to more control than everybody else.<br>
<p>
If nessasary, temporary government posts could be created, by vote, but <br>
this can be taken away on short notice.<br>
<p>
A structure for presenting proposed constitutional changes to the <br>
citizens, and voting on them, would be part of the core.<br>
<p>
A limitation on the number of charactors or words is key, and may be <br>
fixed (unchangeable by vote.)<br>
<p>
"Taxation" may be voluntary or not, that' a tough question.  Presumably <br>
there are some things that pay off better as a joint effort on the part of <br>
the whole country.  In any case, I believe the individual must have <br>
control over which government efforts get her "dollars".  Who has the <br>
right to force another to spend money on something she thinks is wrong?<br>
<p>
Jointly writing such a constitution would be a fun project - off line from<br>
this group (about as much fun as a massive blood clot, if done on this <br>
mailing list).<br>
