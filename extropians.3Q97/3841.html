<i>&gt; &gt; I can see the attraction of a system such as you propose, but even if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; assume that you can make the transaction costs and accounting costs of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a complex barter system so small that instantly trading any commodity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is trivial, it's still not as useful as some forms of money.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Money, here, is... what?  Not the government-issued green stuff, I assume.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; universal standard of exchange?  Somebody accepting, up front, something they</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't need because they know they can trade it for something else, as opposed</i><br>
<i>&gt; to running a hidden cyclic debt cancellation through the barter nexus?</i><br>
<p>
"Money" as I use it here is a measure of worth used by agreement among<br>
traders that is specifically /not/ tied to real commodities.  To be useful,<br>
it must be fictional.  Government fiat is one (bad) way to do that; private<br>
currencies issued by financial institutions (or wealthy individuals) is a<br>
better one.  What makes it "money" is complete lack of intrinsic value.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Money is also decoupled from reality.  Which institutions will survive and</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosper; the ones that actually invest X to produce Y, or the ones that take</i><br>
<i>&gt; your money and promise you a 7% return?  At some point somebody has to use</i><br>
<i>&gt; your widgets, or something you traded your widgets for, to produce additional</i><br>
<i>&gt; wealth.  If widgets can't be used to produce wealth, then investing widgets</i><br>
<i>&gt; will not produce a 7% return.  If widgets can be used to make hamburgers, why</i><br>
<i>&gt; the whole fuss about units of exchange?  Send the guy widgets and trade your</i><br>
<i>&gt; hamburgers to a doctor for medical care!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As far as I can tell, what you're saying is:  "Well, if you abstract away the</i><br>
<i>&gt; process of creating wealth into investing in a 'bank' and getting 7% back,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then you need money."  But why abstract the process of wealth creation, with</i><br>
<i>&gt; attendant inefficiency and information loss?  Getting *away* from that is what</i><br>
<i>&gt; complex barter is all about!</i><br>
<p>
Yes, money hides information; that's one valuable use for it.  Money also<br>
/is/ information, which is another.  It is also data compression, which<br>
makes transactions /more/ efficient, not less.<br>
<p>
Your system of encrypted cyclic debt cancellation works fine for the<br>
ordinary transactions of producing stuff, buying stuff, consuming stuff.<br>
But let's say I wanted to tell someone what I'm "worth", to mortgage<br>
a house, get a credit card, propose marriage, or something.  In your<br>
economy, she'd have to ask something like "how many widgets could you<br>
buy with ready cash?", and the network would go hunting for trades--<br>
without actually executing them--until it simulated trading everything<br>
I own for widgets, and report that count.  But what if she asked in<br>
terms of gadgets instead, and for some reason the gadget supply was<br>
unexpected reduced by an accident at the biggest factory.  She'd get a<br>
smaller number because gadgets would have gone up in price, and she<br>
wouldn't know how to interpret that.<br>
<p>
It is a common myth that only the production of real goods and services<br>
expands the economy.  Simplifying the /methods/ of trade also grows<br>
the economy.  Making it easier for Joe Blow to buy a TV by issuing<br>
him a credit card grows the economy, whether or not anyone produces<br>
a TV and whether or not he actually buys one.  Making it easier for<br>
him to start a business does the same thing.  "Money" is one invention<br>
that makes those things easier, simpler, more efficient.  By decoupling<br>
money from real things, it is insulated from the attendant unpredictable<br>
nature of real things.<br>
