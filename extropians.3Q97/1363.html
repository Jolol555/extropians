Indeed, cultural "racism" is the way of the future. It may be soon <br>
possible to change things like skin, eye and hair color but reliable  <br>
(re-)programming of the brain won't probably be possible for a long<br>
time to come. So the intelligence of people will remain a variable,<br>
and consequently so will the memes they follow. Dumb people<br>
are very likely to "get involved" with stupid and destructive memes <br>
like religion, communism, fascism etc, and may very well become<br>
a serious threat to the evolving transhuman. The irrational masses<br>
will only become more dangerous when "given" advanced future<br>
technologies like nanomachines or body augmentation. It's like<br>
giving a machine-gun to a cave-man...(That's why we should have<br>
some kind of safe retreat, in case things go wrong. Space is the<br>
most logical place to go, for many reasons. It's too bad that <br>
everybody relies on the likes of NASA to do all the pioneering; <br>
there are afaik not even *plans* for an extropian-orientated <br>
space program). <br>
<p>
There is nothing wrong with "discriminating" against other memes;<br>
after all, they _are_  inferior to the forerunners (the transhuman<br>
philosophies) of the "master meme"; the most practical and<br>
pleasant one that is to replace all others. Have the courage and<br>
honesty to say: yes, my meme is the best and your meme sucks<br>
(and I'll most certainly kick your ass if you try to interfere with my<br>
development ]:-)                          <br>
<p>
<i> &gt; The first decade or so the process will likely be rather one way, to</i><br>
<i>&gt; white, but after that more people will want to change in other</i><br>
<i>&gt; directions. There is a real possibility of an entire generation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; whites with black parents, followed by a "brownlash" (couldn't resist</i><br>
<i>&gt; the pun) as color becomes chic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Probably...just like some people today think that the waif "heroin look"<br>
is somehow chic &amp; sexy. Underneath that aryan exterior there still<br>
will be a negro soul...people will still hate eachother, just not at first<br>
glance. The change of skin won't solve the problems of unevenly distributed<br>
intelligence (in the broadest sense of the word), the real cause for<br>
racism.<br>
