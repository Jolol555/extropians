Yes, I see that I worded that wrongly in speaking of the future outcome.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; One of the problems with this scenario is the existence of a clone.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; confuses everything.  My situation:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree to be part of a research experiment.  I am told that a coin was</i><br>
<i>&gt; flipped.  If it came up heads, only I, Person A, was selected to take part in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the experiment.  If it came up tails, two people were selected to take part in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the experiment, one of them being "Person B".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What is the probability that the coin came up heads?</i><br>
<i>&gt; What is the probability that I am person B?</i><br>
<i>&gt; If I am not person B, what is the probability the coin came up heads?</i><br>
<p>
You have reversed the situation from Wei's original example, where the<br>
copying occurs on heads, while you have two people on tails.  Let's change<br>
your example so you select one person on tails and two people on heads.<br>
<p>
Since twice as many people are chosen when you have heads as when you<br>
have tails, then given that you are chosen, the chance of heads was 2/3.<br>
Likewise the other questions will be answered along the lines of Wei's<br>
reasoning.<br>
<p>
The confusing thing about Wei's logic, as he mentions, is that immediately<br>
before the copying you say that the probability of heads is 1/2, and<br>
immediately afterwards, you say it is 2/3.  You don't have any new<br>
information except that the coin flip has occured, yet you change your<br>
judgment of the probabilities.<br>
<p>
It is paradoxical to be in a situation where you *know* that the<br>
probability of an event is going to change even though the only<br>
information you will gain is that time has passed.  Suppose the experiment<br>
will occur at the stroke of midnight.  I know that after midnight I will<br>
believe there was a 2/3 chance that the coin landed heads, but now I<br>
have to believe that there is a 1/2 chance.<br>
<p>
This confusing aspect seems specific to copying experiments.<br>
