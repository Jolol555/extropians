Advances like transsexuality, exowombs, and consciousness uploading could<br>
easily make this "natural social organization" obsolete...  In the next<br>
hundred years YOU might be able to give birth.<br>

<i>&gt;     When you look at history in Western civilization, males have made it a </i><br>

<p>
Speaking as a male, I can state empirically that I have no interest<br>
whatever in keeping either gender organized.  I suspect that I am not in<br>
the minority.<br>

<p>
I wouldn't give males as much credit as you do.  I think that the misogyny<br>
bred a decentralized *disorganized* erosion of feminine self-esteem, and<br>
that swarm behavior, traditionalism and closed-mindedness have conspired in<br>
a far less coordinated manner to keep women suppressed in Western society.<br>
The behavior is emergent.  But, then, I have no evidence for MY<br>
sociological POV, either.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     In patriarchy, you have these elaborate myths about the great "sky </i><br>
<i>&gt;     father", Yahweh, whoever, "creating life".  Of course, what else could </i><br>
<i>&gt;     compete with the simple truth that life comes from the womb with a </i><br>
<i>&gt;     brief assisting moment from a male?  The social constructs that have </i><br>
<i>&gt;     been put in place don't hold much water when set against the simple </i><br>
<i>&gt;     natural sequence of events that results in the ongoing of the species, </i><br>
<i>&gt;     all made possible in the predominant sense by the female.  Not that </i><br>
<i>&gt;     males aren't necessary, not that it wasn't significant for them to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;     a major brute force dominance during the survival eons.  But once </i><br>
<i>&gt;     civilization set in, they didn't ease off the throttle any...until </i><br>
<i>&gt;     this century.  It seems that women have more than paid them back for </i><br>
<i>&gt;     their necessitated thuggery during the dawn of civilization.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I suppose your unsubstantiated reading of history is as good as mine...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     Since survival issues aren't paramount in these much more </i><br>
<i>&gt;     technologically advanced times, it seems only logical that women will </i><br>
<i>&gt;     reclaim their role as the natural life givers, care givers and that </i><br>
<i>&gt;     may likely give way to decision makers and leaders.  Yet still, there </i><br>
<i>&gt;     are the last fervent attempts, the primitive chest beating if you </i><br>
<i>&gt;     will, where men use their trump card, their strength and propensity </i><br>
<i>&gt;     for violence, to delay the inevitable. Of course, a great many of us </i><br>
<i>&gt;     (males) would be content with equality..conceptually anyway. </i><br>
<p>
Technology, like everything else, plays both ways.  What is the essential<br>
difference man and woman when by this time next year you could be either?<br>
(Externally, of course...  The conception organs will come with time.)<br>
