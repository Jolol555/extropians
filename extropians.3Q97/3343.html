<i> &gt; How do you explain then that most people are working harder than</i><br>
<i> &gt; ever before just to make ends meet?  </i><br>
<p>
High taxes, perhaps?  Heavy regulation and mandates?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Real wages adjusted for inflation have been sinking for 25 years.</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  And for much of those 25 years, the public sector's share of<br>
the economy has been increasing.  Could there be a connection?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Full-time benefited employment is decreasing at a dramatic rate,</i><br>
<i> &gt; only to be replaced by part-time and temporary work.</i><br>
<p>
Okay, but when they leave benefited jobs to go to temp work,<br>
are they getting enough of a pay increase to more than<br>
compensate for the loss of benefits and "job security"?  You<br>
don't say.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; A recent poll showed that over 70% of working Americans feel they</i><br>
<i> &gt; have less job security than ever before, are more stressed out on</i><br>
<i> &gt; the job, and are overworked.  </i><br>
<p>
Who conducted the poll?  What was the methodology of the poll?<br>
Certainly I have less job security than ever before... I<br>
planned it that way.  Job security isn't something I find<br>
desirable.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; The 40-hour workweek is more like the 50 and 60-hour workweek for</i><br>
<i> &gt; more and more people.  This low unemployment has another ruthless</i><br>
<i> &gt; edge called the free-market whose greatest success is driving</i><br>
<i> &gt; innovation.</i><br>
<p>
Um, what is wrong with working 50 and 60 hour workweeks if that is<br>
what you want to do?  My own work pattern has been lately developing<br>
into working for several months, and then not working at all for<br>
six weeks or so.  Ideally I'd like to have a pattern of six months<br>
on, six months off.  This would be a *lot* easier for me to do if<br>
I could find jobs that I could stand working 50-hour-workweeks at<br>
during the six-months-on part.  And my six months off would be very<br>
relaxing and enjoyable without contributing to unemployment figures<br>
at all, because unemployment figures only count people who are<br>
actively seeking work.  During my "vacations" (times when I work<br>
on my *own* stuff, really), I would not be counted as "unemployed",<br>
yet overall, I'd be less stressed out and less driven by the rat<br>
race.  None of the figures you present indicate that this couldn't<br>
be happening with most of the people you are worrying about.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Again, more job insecurity, less pay, massive layoffs, and widespread</i><br>
<i> &gt; societal discontent.</i><br>
<p>
Job security is not an objectively good thing.  Your claim about<br>
less pay is based on statistics that correlate well with increased<br>
flow of money (often in "invisible" forms such as mandates and<br>
prohibitions) from the private sector to the public sector.  The<br>
well publicized massive layoffs in major corporations (many of whom<br>
are almost as bad as governments anyway) is balanced by a poorly<br>
publicized growth in small and medium-size businesses.  Widespread<br>
societal discontent or widespread societal content are not things<br>
that I pretend to be able to perceive.  There are six billion people<br>
on this planet, and I can't talk to all of them.  Even just pulling<br>
a truly random sample from the whole world population is still<br>
very difficult at this point in time.  Offhand, I don't know of<br>
anyone who claims to have done it.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; 'Not at all.  I happen to be one of those cyber-geeks!  But unlike</i><br>
<i> &gt; many of my fellow colleagues, I have a conscience and a heart.  I</i><br>
<i> &gt; care about the 80% or humanity I am obsoleting with each line of</i><br>
<i> &gt; code I write.  </i><br>
<p>
You've presented me with no reasons to believe that any line of<br>
code you write is obsoleting anyone.  If the code I write means<br>
that my unit within Pac Bell can do the same job with 10 people<br>
instead of 12, then Pac Bell can use the money saved to hire 2<br>
people *elsewhere*.  Or they can pay it to their shareholders (the<br>
fatcat monopolist public-utility shareholders) and those shareholders<br>
can spend it or invest it on something resulting in the employment<br>
of more people.  Code destroys no jobs, it just makes money.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I have perused the extro list for over 2 years now, and I have yet</i><br>
<i> &gt; to hear any reasonable talk about compassion or building livingry</i><br>
<i> &gt; for the majority o humanity that is becoming increasingly unnecessary</i><br>
<i> &gt; in the free-market.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I'm sorry you weren't paying attention when I was sniping<br>
at Nicholas Bostrom about compassion.  He gave me a lot of crap<br>
about it too... why weren't you standing up for me then, eh?<br>
<p>
Also, your "increasingly unnecessary" claim is totally<br>
unsubstantiated.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; If you don't care extropians, I hope you can bury your conscience</i><br>
<i> &gt; as you watch the rest of humanity languish to death while you ride</i><br>
<i> &gt; your extropic vehicles to the stars.</i><br>
<p>
I have zero interest in watching the rest of humanity languish to<br>
death, and I doubt many other list members do, and it's pretty<br>
offensive of you to imply that this is something we want to do.<br>
A few loudmouths who were cruelly potty-trained or something might<br>
want that, but don't let that prejudice you about all the rest of<br>
us.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; So the question then becomes, whats beyond the free-market?  Any</i><br>
<i> &gt; ideas?</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; I can't think of any with out getting bogged down into some silly</i><br>
<i> &gt; left-winged drivel.  </i><br>
<p>
Well, I wish you could, because criticism without offering<br>
suggested alternatives is sterile.  Not necessarily bad, just<br>
sterile.<br>
