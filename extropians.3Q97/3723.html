<i>        &gt;Yes, you are a different person after 5 minutes, even if you haven't        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;moved.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
So you die ever 5 minutes and a copy is born, if so then this "dying" <br>
business doesn't seem to be any big deal.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What I am trying to say is that if two objects, whatever they are,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;exist simultaneously in different locations, they are not the same         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;object </i><br>
<p>
<p>
But I am not an object, I am not a noun, I am an adjective, I am the way <br>
matter behaves when it is organized in a John K Clark way. At the present <br>
time only one chunk of matter in the universe behaves that way, someday that <br>
could change.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It's not that the copy has moved, it's that the original has *not*         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;moved.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't see how position could be relevant to consciousness, the brain has no <br>
way of detecting it's position, only senses can do that and they need not <br>
come from the same place as the brain.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I agree that we are our thoughts, but the duplicate has had no         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;thoughts, only *memories* of thoughts.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
But memories of thoughts is all you or I or copies or originals have. There <br>
is no way to tell you were not created 5 minutes ago complete with memories <br>
of being a child, and no reason to be concerned if you were. I think that <br>
when you're talking about information, and that's what we are, the <br>
distinction between copy and original becomes meaningless. Do you have my <br>
original post or just an inferior copy? <br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;the original will theoretically still have some of the atoms that </i><br>
<i>        &gt;participated in the chemical reactions that made those thoughts in </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the first place.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
How could that be relevant? Science can not tell one Hydrogen atom from  <br>
another, good thing too because we constantly recycle our atoms, a year ago <br>
your atoms were in plants and fish and birds and cows. <br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If I somehow (another thought experiment) have the exact same thought         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;as you (I'm not sure how you'd go about measuring that) at exactly         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the same time, are our two persons converging.  </i><br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;And if this continues, to the point where ALL our thoughts and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;emotions are exactly the same, have we become one person?  </i><br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Did I die?  </i><br>
<p>
No.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Did you die? </i><br>
<p>
No.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;How can two people become one when both of them still exist?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Because nothing has been lost. If I append your post and my post to the same  <br>
text file both posts still exist but there is only one file.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;To differentiate, I would again have to look at history of action</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't know why I'm the way I am. Nobody consciously understands the <br>
fantastically complicated history that in a universe billions of light years <br>
across and billions of years old somehow brought one particular sperm and one <br>
particular egg together at one particular instant, but consciousness is what<br>
we're concerned with so I don't see how the mysterious history of how I got <br>
to be the way I am could make the slightest difference to my  consciousness. <br>
The only important thing is that I am the way I am.<br>
<p>
