&lt;Question:  Why don't more operating systems come with built in programming<br>
&lt;languages and compilers?<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
&lt;Here's my idea: Build an object oriented visual operating system (not a<br>
&lt;operating system with a GUI strapped on but a visual software<br>
environment).<br>
&lt; Create a simple object system that allows all objects to inherit simple<br>
&lt;properties with zero programming (If it's not attached you can move it).<br>
&lt; Include tools for editing text and objects (all tools can edit all<br>
documents<br>
&lt;and objects, no more applications).  Users can build (rather than program)<br>
&lt;there own tools or they can buy third party-tools.  When they buy<br>
third-party<br>
&lt;tools they're allowed unrestricted access to modify them how they like (by<br>
&lt;sub-classing, so they don't have to see the precious code).<br>
&lt;<br>
I can't help but feel that what you're describing is Visual Basic. When<br>
MS's VB was<br>
trotted out, it was proposed as the "programmer free" programming<br>
environment. Simply<br>
click here, drag there, and you've got a fully functioning enterprise<br>
application! Fire<br>
that expensive programming staff and have your marketing people pull double<br>
duty<br>
as programmers!<br>
<p>
Well, anyone whose spent any time with a marketing staff knows how this<br>
turns out. The<br>
bottom line with programming is that no matter how you may abstract the<br>
details<br>
of the system, there are logical constructs that must be learned to enable<br>
intelligent<br>
program flow for any program. Once someone has learned these, they can<br>
program a <br>
4GL (that is, a language that is very close to English) poorly. To create<br>
optimized programs, <br>
they must learn the particulars of the system. The cry that may be arising<br>
now is: "Well what<br>
about Java? It totally abstracts the system? How about that?" The truth is<br>
that Java provides<br>
another system, the Java virtual machine, whose particulars you must learn<br>
to program well<br>
in Java.<br>
<p>
&lt;Now, you could say this is the way operating systems are going, or even<br>
the<br>
&lt;way they are (if you buy the right applications).  But I think the ability<br>
to<br>
&lt;create should be built into operating systems at the lowest possible<br>
level.<br>
&lt; We need software environments where we can manipulate and create objects<br>
&lt;directly rather than using bulky applications.<br>
<p>
What you're describing is an interlocking API, which most modern operating<br>
systems<br>
have on some level or another. <br>
<p>
&lt;This has a deeper meaning than just allowing anyone to create software<br>
(and<br>
&lt;thus insuring a healthy supply of programmers).  It is also important for<br>
the<br>
&lt;future of computing and the _death of the software industry_ (cue Jaws<br>
&lt;music)…<br>
<p>
&lt;As computers progress, they will reach a point where we &lt;gasp&gt; no longer<br>
need<br>
&lt;to buy software (or download it from the net).  Instead, you the user will<br>
&lt;program your own computer via voice recognition/understanding and, through<br>
&lt;Artificial Intelligence your computer will program itself.  No software<br>
&lt;applications, just a pool of reusable components and agents that are<br>
clipped<br>
&lt;together as you speak.  To get to this wonderful utopian freeware future<br>
we<br>
&lt;need to point ourselves in the right direction…<br>
<p>
Voice recognition is pretty well here already; nondiscrete (not stopping<br>
for every word)<br>
VR is present in the latest version of Dragon Dictate, the bellwhether<br>
product for <br>
consumer VR. Reusable components is a good idea whose time has come, and is<br>
pretty well integrated into the Wintel (that is, Microsoft) world. Now<br>
about programmers...<br>
If by 'you', you mean me in particular, or most of the people in this<br>
group, you might<br>
be right. But the reason that there are programmers, technicians, and<br>
television<br>
journalists out there is because people don't want to think. <br>
<p>
&lt;--Wax<br>
<p>
&lt;P.S. Okay I'll admit it I'm using Windows, yeah I'm a hypocrite, could<br>
&lt;someone point me in the direction of freeware land... I seem to be lost!<br>
