Several semantic debates occurred here recently. I might characterize<br>
these as arguments on the question "IS thing X an instance of set Y?",<br>
the canonical example of which has been the debate over the "reality"<br>
of the Mandelbrot set.<br>
<p>
Almost all such arguments boil down to questions of<br>
definitionalism. "Is the Mandelbrot set 'real'", for instance, hinges<br>
entirely on the question of how one defines 'real'. Answering such<br>
questions does not seem to have much interest to me -- I do not find<br>
the answers particularly enlightening since if one shifts the<br>
defintion, the answer shifts, and thus no interesting data has been<br>
revealed in generating the answer.<br>
<p>
The use of e-prime sometimes points out when a question has this<br>
property. Note that one can't ask the question about the Mandelbrot<br>
set without the use of the verb "to be". This indicates to me that<br>
answering the question will not increase my understanding of the<br>
Mandelbrot set (or anything else) particularly much.<br>
<p>
The closest you can model the question in e-prime is "does the<br>
Mandelbrot set comply with definition X of 'real'", which I believe<br>
points out my problem with this and all similar questions.<br>
