     Clarke knows about cryonics, and has even written a brief for Alcor <br>
     back when they were under attack by government agencies. He has no <br>
     plans to sign up, and has some objection based on his view of personal <br>
     identity, i.e., he thinks there is no point signing up because he will <br>
     eventually become such a different person. I find it hard to see this <br>
     as anything other than a rationalization for some fear he has.<br>

     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     Why do you find it hard to see that the man's view of life extension <br>
     involves the relinquishing of acquired self-hood?  It tends to be for <br>
     the pro-cryonics crowd the ultimate holy grail (pardon the religious <br>
     pun) that the body and the self are unconditionally joined.  I have no <br>
     interest in cryonics and it has nothing to do with fear.  But a person <br>
     with the intelligence that Clarke has and the vision that he has time <br>
     and time again most aptly conveyed to the world doesn't seem to match <br>
     up to the judgment you would assign him.<br>
     <br>
     Clarke may find that cryonics, despite any compelling empirical <br>
     evidence, is just a quaint notion, like a child not wanting to give up <br>
     his belief in Santa Claus.  It's not so much the preservation of <br>
     body/brain that cryonics promotes but the restoration/reactivation of <br>
     a pre-existing "self".  This alludes to self being completely <br>
     electro-chemical in nature.<br>
     <br>
     To that I pose the question: what of the person who suffers <br>
     irrecoverable amnesia, forgeting all memories of the former life <br>
     including intimate relationships, even children.  Did that "person" <br>
     die?  Who know is in charge of the body of that person?<br>
     <br>
     On the other hand, look the people documented in the book/film <br>
     "Awakenings".  Time stopped for these people, sometimes for decades, <br>
     until they were brought back to life (mentally).  The thing was, <br>
     during their zombie-like state, their physical lives were continuing.  <br>
     A cryonically preserved body/head may be regarded as living.  I think <br>
     a distinction between preserved and living is yet to be made.<br>
     <br>
     The reanimation notions promoted in "Fifth Element" (a person rebuilt <br>
     from a rescued amputated arm I think) is interesting to note.  Is <br>
     consciousness embedded in every cell so that when the complete <br>
     physiological form is re-fashioned, the brain re-establishes itself as <br>
     the command center, taking its information from a cellular "upload"?<br>
     <br>
