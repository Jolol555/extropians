     I have made the assertion that I presently have no interest in <br>
     cryonics and it has nothing to do with fear.   <br>
     <br>
     Max More asks: <br>
     <br>
     What does it have to do with? Do you think it won't work? Or do you <br>
     have faith in an afterlife?<br>
     <br>
     Rick responds:<br>
     <br>
     Upon analysis, there may be residual cultural programming that holds <br>
     to a "belief" in afterlife.  However, one of my favorite sayings in my <br>
     more informed years is "belief is a choice" kind of like "I like <br>
     vanilla".  Why?  Because I do.  (Actually, my spiritual beliefs were <br>
     augmented very much by sexual orientation issues I contended with).  <br>
     My psychedelic experiences probably provide more compelling "personal" <br>
     evidence of something buzzing beyond the physical realm.<br>
     <br>
     Do I think it won't work?  Yes, I'd have to say that I think freezing <br>
     one's head in the hopes of reanimating it and picking up where one <br>
     left off to have just about as much stock as the energy that makes me <br>
     who I am has a separate existence apart from my physicality.  I do <br>
     think it's possible to reanimate a human being if properly preserved.  <br>
     Who will occupy that reanimated physical space is not clear.  I go <br>
     back to my question about a person who experiences profound brain <br>
     trauma that results in irrecoverable amnesia.  The physical body is <br>
     there but the self who people once knew is not.  Likewise, the person <br>
     in that physical body has no recollection of many facets of their <br>
     previous life (although they do hold onto to other learned concepts <br>
     like the language they were raised with).<br>
     <br>
     Once one reaches a point where death is inevitable, there is certainly <br>
     no fear to contend with.  Buried or frozen, you are out of the picture <br>
     (and I guess with cryonics, that means "for a while").<br>
     <br>
     I guess for me it may boil down to trust in humans.  I have trust <br>
     issues and contracts and pre-procedural assurances aside, IF the me <br>
     that I knew did re-emerge, I may not at all be so thrilled with the <br>
     outcome.  When I compare this to my choice to believe that my <br>
     consciousness is a self-contained energy field that may have sentience <br>
     beyond physical mortality, I have, curiously, much less mistrust.  It <br>
     may be because humans are such predictable assholes; etherial <br>
     creatures on the other hand, I don't have as much experience with &lt;G&gt;.<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
