Anders Sandberg replies:<br>

<p>
I think it depends on how much sociobiology they've studied.  People<br>
who've read things like Dawkins's THE EXTENDED PHENOTYPE would<br>
tend, I think, to see their technological property as extensions<br>
of their bodies and their nontechnological property (land, minerals,<br>
other organisms) as part of their territory.<br>
<p>
This is a very interesting perspective that I hadn't ever thought<br>
of quite this way before, thanks.<br>
