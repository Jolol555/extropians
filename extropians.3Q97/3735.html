A thought on Ethics and Politics:<br>
<p>
      Do we need either?<br>
<p>
We do everything for a reason, otherwise we wouldn't do it.  We show emotion<br>
in exchange for emotion, we give physical things in exchange for physical<br>
things, we show emotion in exchange for physical things, and we give physical<br>
things in exchange for emotion.  Isn't compassion just like money, we<br>
exchange it in return for more compassion (in various different forms) or we<br>
exchange it for goods and services.  But we never do anything without a<br>
reason.  So, isn't this all covered by the free market?  Doesn't a<br>
compassionate individual have a competitive advantage? Doesn't a cooperative<br>
individual have a marketing edge?<br>
<p>
Sometimes I think these problems only exist because we make them a problem,<br>
perhaps peace is a technological fix.<br>
