There was a famous stink about Skeptical Inquirer's treatment of Michel<br>
Gauquelin's `Mars Effect' studies.  The basic idea is described in the<br>
following abstract from the Journal of Scientific Exploration (a<br>
peer-reviewed journal), Volume 1 : Number 2 : <br>

The so-called "Mars Effect" is discussed in a larger context. The<br>
phenomenon refers to a significant<br>
tendency for champion athletes to have been born at the time of either the<br>
rise or the upper<br>
culmination of the planet Mars. The populations and sample, methodology and<br>
its development are<br>
described along with earlier and more recent findings. Control studies and<br>
replications by others are<br>
reported in some detail. Particular attention is paid to certain basic and<br>
procedural criticisms and the<br>
problem of bias or artifacts. The current scientific status of the issue is<br>
reviewed in light of several<br>
kinds of empirical evidence that has accumulated over the past three<br>
decades. The question raised in<br>
the title of the paper is answered in the affirmative.<br>
<p>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
This apparently ludicrous claim was tested with new data by Sk. Inqu.<br>
folks, and (to summarise  brutally) when they apparently corroborated<br>
Gauquelin's [extremely limited and *non*-astrological] findings, the<br>
magazine declined to accept or, as I recall, even publish the results.<br>
There's a lot about this on the net, but I don't have the urls handy.<br>
<p>
Recently, a similar effect has been claimed by the physicist and<br>
parapsychologist James Spottiswoode, whose meta-analysis of many psi<br>
studies in different parts of the world showed that effect sizes were<br>
markedly greater at a particular sidereal time of the day.  This suggests<br>
some interaction between attempts at paranormal activities (precognition,<br>
etc) and some extra-solar phenomenon.  I hate this idea, and so does<br>
Spottiswoode, precisely because it smacks of airhead astrology, but the<br>
evidence is not without its compelling aspects.  Those intrigued by this<br>
might take a gander at:<br>

<p>
(To declare an interest: I have published a book on research in applied<br>
parapsychological techniques, including a detailed analysis of my own on a<br>
database comprising three quarters of a billion guesses.  I remain<br>
open-minded about the possibility that claims of psi represent a genuine<br>
paradigm-buster teasingly, endlessly, hanging just beyond the experimental<br>
horizon...)<br>
