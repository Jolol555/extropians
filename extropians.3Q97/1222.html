Yes, this is a tough problem, isn't it?  It's one of the things I liked<br>
best about Robin's idea futures.  It seems like a reliable tool for<br>
evaluating people who had good ideas, especially when I don't have the<br>
knowledge or time to look at their credentials and deside if they are<br>
meaningful.  <br>
<p>
Another method is to pick someone you trust who has the expertise, time,<br>
and inclination to evaluate these people.  I knew someone (probably a few<br>
people, come to think of it) who relied on Richard Feynman to evaluate all<br>
or most scientific theories that hit the news.  Cold fusion gets announced,<br>
wait until Feynman makes a comment and go with what he says.  I'm not sure<br>
who I'd pick today, but you want a combination of knowledge about the<br>
domain and an ability to think rationally about the implications of the<br>
theory.  CSICOP is another good resource, and they take the time to address<br>
the more patently absurd ideas.<br>
<p>
And then there's basic prejudices.  There's a class of idea that always<br>
seems built on flimsy evidence and protected by claims of conspiracy.  I<br>
don't spend much time worrying about faces on Mars and aliens at Roswell.<br>
Jerry O'Neil once wrote, "never ascribe to conspiracy what can be<br>
satisfactorily explained by stupidity."<br>
<p>
Best,<br>
