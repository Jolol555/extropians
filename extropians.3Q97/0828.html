     <br>
     I would be *very* cautious about this.  What worries me is this<br>
     there's a lot of evidence to suggest that infants are a bundle of<br>
     expectations - possibilities waiting to be fulfilled by events in the<br>
     world.  This is how nature and nurture interact, in the broad sense.<br>
     Artificial wombs would have many positive benefits, for sure, but I<br>
     worry that infants raised in them might be mentally disturbed by the<br>
     lack of typical womb-like sounds and sensations, and also the <br>
     responsiveness and 'feedback' or 'communication' between mother and <br>
     child in-womb (e.g. infant shifts position, mother shifts position, <br>
     stuff like that). <br>
     <br>
     Rick comments (relative to a previous assertion about the "intent of <br>
     nature")<br>
     <br>
     Maybe nature doesn't have a conscious intent like how we think of it <br>
     to be.  However, this was my very thought when people here started <br>
     lauding this as "Yippie" we're human free!  I, too, am rather curious <br>
     about the resultant being who has no human connectivity during its <br>
     gestation.<br>
