A defense against any who think I'm influenced by Banks too much: I<br>
think he's about as extropian as Vinge, only more optimistic.  He's got<br>
the goodies -- matter manipulation, AI, immortality, superhuman<br>
intelligence, genetic modifications up the wazoo.  He also has force<br>
fields, FTL, and lots of aliens, but I consider those to be like the<br>
Zones -- necessary for him to tell his stories, but not necessary for<br>
the recognizable (if smaller) existence of his world.  He's got similar<br>
politics, but he comes from the anarcho-socialist side, which is as<br>
nice or nicer to live in as an anarcho-capitalist society except that <br>
no one talks about their economy enough.  (As opposed to a socialist<br>
state, where one might not want to live anyway, never mind if it<br>
works.)<br>
<p>
And unlike Vinge, he can see the continued existence of humans without<br>
appealing to hokey mechanisms.  I've expressed doubts about the<br>
Singularity before, so it shouldn't surprise anyone that I think <br>
something like the Culture is as likely as a Singularity, Spike, or<br>
Crunch (my advisor, Bruce Murray, has his own term.)  What Vinge sees is<br>
everything speeding up into some violent unpredictable cataclysm, which<br>
we get to survive as best we can, or not at all.  Banks notes that the<br>
humans starting the process are social and civilized, and assumes they<br>
remain so and become more so -- not less.  One could even say the<br>
Culture is the result of a civilized Singularity.<br>
<p>
Practically, Banks might be better for proselytization.  Many of us were<br>
inspired by Vinge, which is kind of odd considering that _Marooned in<br>
Realtime_ has a rather creepy mystery surrounding the end of the human<br>
race and that _Fire_ has big fences guarding us from the big nasty<br>
Powers, who are born in catastrophic transcendances of a race.  Or<br>
considering that I haven't gotten the impression that Vinge himself is<br>
unambiguously inspired by all this -- more that he sees the Singularity<br>
as inevitable, and he can't ignore it to write space opera, than that he<br>
thinks the extinction of the human race in the name of higher<br>
intelligence and complexity is desirable.  (Or the Singularity could be<br>
avoided, but at even worse cost -- _The Peace War_, "The Peddler's<br>
Apprentice".<br>
<p>
"And for all my rampant technological optimism, sometimes I think I'd be<br>
more comfortable if I were regarding these transcendental events from<br>
one thousand years remove ... instead of twenty."<br>
<p>
If the Singularity can disturb some of us, or Vinge himself, how do you<br>
think most people will react?  The Rapturists here have asked for<br>
brainstorming on how to spread our ideas.  That could be a bad idea, in<br>
current format.  Most people will find the story "Unknown Kadath"<br>
horrifying, not inspiring.  If you argue that attempts to stop progress<br>
are inevitable people will panic and try to stop you all the more.<br>
<p>
I mean, the Culture itself is probably frightening to many.  400 year<br>
lifespans, drug glands and true sex-changing as a genetic birthright,<br>
immortality or uploading as options, resurrection, AIs, living on the<br>
kindness of superhuman Minds, hedonism, etc.  Not well-accepted memes at<br>
the moment.  But "all" it requires for acceptance is tolerance and some<br>
expanded horizons.  As opposed to worrying about having enough education<br>
to survive the next three decades, or having humanity be convicted of<br>
inefficiency and wiped out.<br>

Genua had once controlled the river mouth and taxed its traffic in a way that<br>
couldn't be called piracy because it was done by the city government.<br>
