     Hi,<br>
     <br>
     Has anyone become familiar with this association?  They are into <br>
     dispensing information (at a cost) in a direct marketing motif to <br>
     educate people on the Federal Reserve Bank, offshore/foreign <br>
     investing, common law, reducing/eliminating taxes, what the US <br>
     Constitution means to "YOU", etc.  The claim is there is substantial <br>
     money-making power in the information they have to offer and there <br>
     seems to be an anarchist feel to it (which I find somewhat <br>
     intriguing).<br>
     <br>
     I have more research to do on it but I do have a sense of trust in<br>
the <br>
     person that introduced me to the concept.  The fellow leading the <br>
     organization is Keith Anderson and they have all their seminars in<br>
the <br>
     Caribbean or Mexico.  It costs $1250 to get their first 12 hours of <br>
     audiotapes of information.<br>
     <br>
     A while back there was a thread here about making money in offshore <br>
     investing.  Any connection between those posts and this organization?<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
<p>
Dear Rick:<br>
<p>
Watch out for anyone who feels that they have to hold their "seminars"<br>
(see: sales pitch) offshore.<br>
Do not give them any money until you have all the facts from several<br>
reliable independent sources. <br>
If I were you I'd find out where they are incorporated, check their D&amp;B<br>
rating, check with the SEC and the State Attorney General's securities<br>
bureau in whatever state they are making their initial offering in. Check<br>
with the FTC and the BBB.<br>
<p>
Beware of multi-level distributorships and get-rich-quick schemes. Beware<br>
of franchises and dealerships. The only one who usually makes any real<br>
money in these schemes is the original promoter.<br>
<p>
IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT IS USUALLY A SCAM.<br>
<p>
