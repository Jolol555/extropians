The terminology doesn't matter much to me, really. We're all talking<br>
about the same thing. However I do think that uploading is the<br>
commonly-accepted descriptive. You are sending data to another platform,<br>
this is uploading. I suppose for the new platform, receiving you is akin<br>
to downloading. Either way, it's a transfer. Nonetheless, I'll probably<br>
stick with uploading. <br>
<p>
As far as geekiness and SF are concerned, uploading/downloading are<br>
everyday terms these days. IMO, non-geeks and even starched<br>
country-clubbers who've never read SF in their life are just as apt to<br>
use them in idle chit-chat as the most net-savvy cybernaut. Moreover,<br>
even if one doesn't use the terms, one probably knows what it means. <br>
<p>
But, of course, I could be wrong.<br>
