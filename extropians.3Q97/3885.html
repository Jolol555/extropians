: but I respect your position.<br>
<p>
Upset?  Hardly.  I can't spend every day being upset about<br>
the fact that millions of people are wrong about guns.<br>
And I did not remember who was my opponent in that mini-debate.<br>
<p>
About genocides, you said, "Technology does not help here."<br>
But in Peru it did.  Where once wealth or physical strength<br>
meant the ability to dominate the poor and the scrawny, the<br>
technology of portable firearms lets small, poor, unskilled<br>
people defend themselves, individually, even standing a good<br>
chance against superior numbers (the defender's advantage).<br>
As a cure for genocide I have more faith in that than in<br>
all the sermons and all the "caring" in the world.<br>
<p>
: The reason I didn't mention Shining Path scum was that I did not have<br>
: accurate data on them. In this particular case I agree with you that<br>
: allowing the peasants to defend themselves could help to some extend.<br>
: Personally I would have prefered the Peruvian Army hunting them down<br>
: but that seemed non-feasable.<br>
<p>
A few days ago you gave us a list of mega-murders, all(?) carried out<br>
by men in uniform.  (Unorganized mobs sometimes go on murderous rampages,<br>
but I'm not aware of any that went on for years - unless they had<br>
official sponsors.)  And yet you prefer organized proactive violence<br>
to individual defensive violence.<br>
