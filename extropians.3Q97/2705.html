Natch; H.P. Lovecraft doesn't do nano.  It's some Web story written<br>
probably in the past couple of years, with a Lovecraft-inspired title<br>
probably because the author wanted to write a story with that title.  (I<br>
don't remember any compelling analogy in the story itself, or reason in<br>
the surrounding text.)<br>

 <br>
Conversely, I have no idea where silver as protective comes from.  It's<br>
been bouncing around my head going nowhere for several minutes now.<br>
First three contacts are silver dragons in AD&amp;D, the black-and-silver of<br>
Minas Tirith, and C.S. Lewis's the _Silver Throne_ (Narnia) which was<br>
associated with malevolence.  All of those hits have taken a while.  The<br>
closest association I have with silver is magic, and even that's pretty<br>
loose outside of proper context.  Siler goo doesn't do anything for me.<br>
<p>

} Because nobody can visualize khaki in the same way they can visualize blue or<br>
<p>
Agreed.<br>
<p>
I think it may be time to give up on colored good.  "Gray goo" may work,<br>
because it's been around for a while, and gray may imply machines, so<br>
gray goo leads to mechanical, well, goo, which has got to creep most<br>
people out.  I don't know how well this would translate, though.  "Blue<br>
goo" and "green goo" were good for our culture -- policemen in blue,<br>
ecofanatic "Greens" -- but they probably don't translate well.  (Hell,<br>
colors don't necessarily translate well themselves, although I'd guess<br>
this isn't a problem in Europe.)<br>
<p>
And even "green goo" isn't that good -- sure, it's ecological, but maybe<br>
it's blue goo for the environment, or what gray goo turns into after it<br>
starts mutating and evolving (actually, I like that) or something else.<br>
<p>
I fully admit that colored goos are cute, but the very fact we're having<br>
this debate shows that they're not automatically intuitive, which was<br>
the whole point.<br>
<p>
"Police goo" and "war goo" give pretty good ideas.  (Of course, there<br>
could be benevolent police good and police state police goo.  Sigh.)<br>
There's also "plague goo", although whether that should apply to grey<br>
goo (out of control parasitic nanites) or traditional "green goo"<br>
(really a specific form of war goo) I'm not sure.<br>
<p>
Thing is, we can afford to use confusing terms when the concept itself<br>
takes explaining.  "Grey goo" works becuase you probably have to explain<br>
nano-goo in the first place.  After that "police goo" and "war goo"<br>
should be pretty obvious, more so than red, black, or khaki goo.<br>
"Golden goo" might be worth keeping, if the idea of out of control<br>
mining nanites isn't fully suggested by "mining goo".  "Plague goo"<br>
could be war goo which used biological attacks.  "Gobbling goo" are<br>
nanites which just replicate -- like "gray goo", and it also links to<br>
the Gobbler von Neumann machines in Brin's "Lungfish" (analogous to<br>
Berserkers).<br>
<p>
Grey goo, police goo, war goo, golden goo, plague goo, gobbling goo<br>
perhaps as deliberate gobblers vs. grey goo.  Green goo as a nanite<br>
population beginning to become rather lifelike itself.<br>
