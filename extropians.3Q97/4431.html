Hi this is my first post to the extropian list !<br>

 I remember Gerard O'Neill saying in an interview that he thought that<br>
mini-worlds  would be a place where true democracy could finally occur:<br>
according to him, an  independant population of about 50 000, roughly lik=<br>
e<br>
the antique Athenes  demography, could permit everybody to have a real<br>
power on the global politics.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Otherwise you'd be throwing, say, European left-anarchist values at</i><br>
American<br>
<i>&gt;right-anarchist values, and making a mess.</i><br>
<p>
It's true that the two trends of anarchism have difficulties to cohabit. =<br>
I<br>
was accustomed to left anarchist values when I first meet the extropians<br>
more than one year ago (through the transhuman list), and it was a real<br>
"cultural shock!". Only now I begin to understand the values of these<br>
strange animals (I continue to disagree, but, at least, I understand). =<br>
<p>
This kind of debate always remind me "Illuminatus"  this card with two<br>
faces one saying "property is theft" the other "property is liberty". Thi=<br>
s<br>
depends, says Wilson, of the meaning of "property" One is property of the=<br>
<p>
means of production; the second is property of personal objects.<br>
Right-winged anarchism goes too far (IMHO) when it suggest the<br>
privatization of all (such as for instance, oxygen supply in an O'Neill<br>
cylinder), and left anarchism is wong when it contests the property of<br>
personal goods (for instance, Emmet Grogan, leader of the<br>
anarcho-socialists Diggers, telling Allen Ginsberg he was an ugly<br>
capitalist, only because he wanted  to retire in a house with a garden!).=<br>
<p>
Are right and left anarchism really opposite ideologies ? sometimes, ther=<br>
e<br>
can be a fruitful collaboration. The best example, IMO, is the GNU projec=<br>
t,<br>
a pure anarcho-socialist project (no property of information!) which gave=<br>
<p>
birth to successful companies such as Cygnus. =<br>
<p>
<p>
By the way, Damien, I think you are right when saying that left anarchism=<br>
<p>
is mostly european and right anarchism american (although there are<br>
important exceptions, of course). I think this is because during centurie=<br>
s,<br>
USA were a very large place, and when somebody was unhappy, he was free t=<br>
o<br>
do his own thing by going to West. To the contrary, Europe is overcrowded=<br>
<p>
since centuries (a little like a spaceship). =<br>

Bye, =<br>
