(in reference to someone's use of "so-called 14th Amendment")<br>
<i> &gt; I have a semantics problem with this paragraph.  I understand</i><br>
<i> &gt; referring to the Constitution of the United States as the so-called</i><br>
<i> &gt; Constitution, as a constitution is a document that governs the</i><br>
<i> &gt; legal workings of an organization, and many people think that the</i><br>
<i> &gt; legal system often subverts and ignores the provisions of the</i><br>
<i> &gt; constitution in pursuit of their political projects.</i><br>
<i> &gt; However, an amendment is simply something in a document that was</i><br>
<i> &gt; put in later through a process described in the original document.</i><br>
<p>
This is precisely the point at issue among those who dispute<br>
the legality of the 14th amendment and the other Reconstruction<br>
Amendments.  The process by which they were added to the<br>
Constitution is not the process described in the original<br>
document, because the legal situation at the time (one half the<br>
country having been conquered by the other half) was never<br>
foreseen by the Constitution.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; The 14th amendment was not in the Constitution as originally written</i><br>
<i> &gt; and was added later.  It is generally called the 14th Amendment,</i><br>
<i> &gt; but that is because it is in fact the 14th Amendment, and not</i><br>
<i> &gt; because of some disinformation program.</i><br>
<p>
I wish the matter could be settled as simply as that, but unfortunately,<br>
the minority side make a pretty strong case.  Our legal protections<br>
are mostly rooted in historical matters of fact, and history is<br>
very messy.<br>
