There is another thing to keep in mind, too: as the total wealth<br>
avaiilable as an aggregate (including health issues as indirect as fewer<br>
plague-carrying rats) increases, the total number of bottom-out-of-sight<br>
people the Earth can support goes *up*. It must, even if they're living on<br>
nothing more than table scraps and living in cardboard boxes, as long as<br>
there are more table scraps and cardboard boxes than there used to be.<br>
<p>
Note that this "must" I'm using is predicated on the notion that people<br>
have, in general, an interest scatter diagram like the one Bucky Fuller<br>
used to talk about: heavily biased toward "me, right now".<br>
<p>
And it's a simple observation that the bottom-out-of-sighters have little<br>
incentive to move *their* point on the scatter diagram very far.<br>
<p>
Now, "bottom-out-of-sight" is still different in different places.<br>
Some people in the US live in malnutrition because they're too mentally<br>
disturbed or too proud to do anything about it. When is the first<br>
different from the second? Who decides? That said, the number of open<br>
ulcerated sores you see on a street in Calcutta is probably going to be a<br>
lot higher than the number you see among street people in Golden Gate<br>
Park.<br>
<p>
The very real experience of people starving to death in Somalia, to name<br>
another example, includes as causes the fact that some Somalians with guns<br>
are starving other Somalians without guns, and the fact that some<br>
Somalians don't consider fish to be people food, and will starve<br>
rather than eat the unfamiliar stuff. Both of these are cultural; to<br>
change them would require "cultural imperialism", which we are told is a<br>
bad thing. Do cultures have rights, or do people?<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;experience of starving to death, is denial of the worst sort, and IMO</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;downright mean. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;One could also say stupid people of today are much smarter than the stupid</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;people of yesterday. It is meaningless.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Of course, people are far less ignorant today, but  the knowledge required to</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;level of ignorance  and stay just below the amount required to deal with this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;new and complex environment, they will still not be able to function very</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;well. They will suffer from it. The bottom is still the bottom. Starving is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;still starving. Stupid is still stupid. </i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In fact the concept of "the poor" and of "poverty" as one of RELATIVE</i><br>
<i>&gt; deprivation is actually the most common one in mainstream sociology in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Britain (and I suspect in the USA too).  Thus, the British sociological</i><br>
<i>&gt; and socialist establishments constantly berate relatively market</i><br>
<i>&gt; oriented societies for not having abolished poverty - simply by</i><br>
<i>&gt; constantly raising the "poverty threshold".  What they are really</i><br>
<i>&gt; complaining about, of course, is the existence of inequality, but since</i><br>
<i>&gt; those who earn less in market-oriented socities are actually rich in</i><br>
<i>&gt; terms of all previously existing societies, and most existing ones</i><br>
<i>&gt; elsewhere in the contemporary world, they wish to add the opprobium of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "poverty" (with images of starvation etc) to their critique of</i><br>
<i>&gt; inequality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Market and libertarian scholars in the UK havev responded by stating</i><br>
<i>&gt; that this is nonsensical, and that "poverty" in its "derogatory" sense,</i><br>
<i>&gt; so to speak, should be defined in an "absolute sense", ie, in terms of</i><br>
<i>&gt; near starvation, absence of basic essentials etc. It is thus quite clear</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it is market oriented societies which have succeeded in largely</i><br>
<i>&gt; eradicating poverty. It is really downright mean, and totally foolish,</i><br>
<i>&gt; to deny the evidence of history and all rational social science - that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the road to prosperity and abundance is the road of market</i><br>
<i>&gt; relationships. In so far as those relationships are hampered or</i><br>
<i>&gt; destroyed by the state, or "private" coercion, livelihooDs and</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosperity will be harmed. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Market oriented societies (even a totally free market) can never, of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course, eradicate inequality - but then neither can any other form of</i><br>
<i>&gt; socio-political order. But inequality per se, contrary to socialist</i><br>
<i>&gt; egalitarians, is not unjust.</i><br>
