<p>
Apparently so.  IBM in the 1960s and 1970s was in a market-dominant<br>
position very similar to the position that Microsoft is in now.<br>
Its repressive influence on progress in computer technology was<br>
also about the same as that being exercised by Microsoft now.  But<br>
Digital's VMS systems and the Unix system out of AT&amp;T (popularized<br>
on Digital's machines) did not go extinct, and eventually a smart<br>
young feller named Bill Gates figured out how to steal IBM's fire<br>
by stealing its new microcomputer platform out from underneath it.<br>
<p>
Natural monopolies of this kind grow up from time to time.  They<br>
last, usually, for a few years or decades because they are pioneering<br>
a new market niche that people are unfamiliar with, and because<br>
they provide service, products, and prices that are "good enough"<br>
for the vast majority of new consumers entering this market.  Alcoa,<br>
which dominated the aluminum industry in that industry's infancy<br>
by keeping its prices very low, is another good example.<br>
<p>
This sort of monopoly is not nearly as pernicious as monopolies<br>
like the US Post Office, whose competition is prohibited by<br>
legislative fiat, and the oppressive influence of which can last<br>
for centuries and not mere decades.<br>
<p>
Eventually, someone will trip up Microsoft the way Microsoft tripped<br>
up IBM in the 1980s.  It's a fairly straightforward measure of the<br>
ambition of any young business executive in the software industry<br>
whether they dream of unseating billg@microsoft.com one day; I<br>
suspect that most of them do, though few of them mouth off about<br>
in public.  I doubt that any human being or corporation can withstand<br>
being the focus of that kind of competitive pressure for many<br>
decades.  Although I've badmouthed Microsoft on this list before,<br>
really, I think the US federal government is a much greater threat.<br>
