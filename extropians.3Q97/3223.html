<i>&gt;25 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE "ATOMIC BOMB"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. Is there any evidence that a thermonuclear device exploded over</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hiroshima in 1945?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, absolutely none. According to leading historians and physicists, </i><br>
<i>&gt;the thermonuclear bomb was not invented until years after the supposed </i><br>
<i>&gt;detonation over Japanese territory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. Is there any evidence that a uranium-based "atom bomb" was ever dropped</i><br>
<i>&gt;onto Nagasaki, Japan?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Absolutely not. While many historians and journalists made this claim</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the late 40's and early 50's, everyone now agrees that no such</i><br>
<i>&gt;bomb ever exploded over Nagasaki. Yet there are some who still stubbornly</i><br>
<i>&gt;cling to this supposed "fact."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. What are the materials needed to make an "atom bomb?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Uranium-238 and plutonium-239. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;4. Aren't these materials radioactive?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Highly so. Anybody who attempts to use these materials is endangering</i><br>
<i>&gt;his/her life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;5. Is it likely that nuclear scientists in the 40's would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;handling uranium and plutonium?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This would be highly unlikely. Very few people felt so threatened</i><br>
<i>&gt;by the Japanese to be willing to risk their lives on a theoretical</i><br>
<i>&gt;chance of a superbomb that could end a far-away war a little sooner.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;6. Aren't there witnesses to the atomic bomb in Hiroshima?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The only "witnesses" that could possibly survived this supposed</i><br>
<i>&gt;explosion would have been blinded by the intense flash of light,</i><br>
<i>&gt;so their testimony is quite unreliable and contradictory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;7. According to conventional historians, was the uranium bomb tested </i><br>
<i>&gt;before supposedly being dropped over Hiroshima?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No. There was no testing whatsoever of a uranium bomb in Alamogordo</i><br>
<i>&gt;or anywhere else before Hiroshima.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;8. Isn't that strange?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes. Typical weapons are tested for months and years before deployment;</i><br>
<i>&gt;there is no other weapon that according to the accepted "facts" deployed</i><br>
<i>&gt;before any testing whatsoever.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;9. How many witnesses are there for all of the atomic tests allegedly</i><br>
<i>&gt;occuring during the fifties and sixties?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Very few, perhaps a few hundred, who claimed to have seen them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;10. What did the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy</i><br>
<i>&gt;Commission say in their report of October 30, 1949?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;They recommended strongly against the development of what they</i><br>
<i>&gt;called the "Super Bomb," which is simply a thermonuclear</i><br>
<i>&gt;bomb. They said that "A super bomb might become a weapon of</i><br>
<i>&gt;genocide."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;11. Isn't this four years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes. Obviously development of nuclear weapons occurred well</i><br>
<i>&gt;after their supposed implementation in 1945. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;12. Is radioactivity dangerous?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Everything is radioactive to some extent. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;13. What was the triggering method of the bomb that supposedly</i><br>
<i>&gt;was dropped on Hiroshima?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;According to the standard historical accounts, it used a gun-</i><br>
<i>&gt;assembly trigger.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;14. Wasn't the gun-assembly method of triggering abandoned</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the design stage?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes; according to these same sources the gun method would not</i><br>
<i>&gt;work with uranium-derived plutonium-239 because some of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;plutonium-239 absorbs a neutron to become plutonium-240, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;undergoes spontaneous fission, all before supercriticality,</i><br>
<i>&gt;causing a premature and very small explosion that is unusable</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the very purpose that it was supposedly designed for!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;15. How do conventional historians rectify these two "facts?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;They don't even attempt to. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;16. How many books have been written about the atomic bomb?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Many hundreds, as well as thousands of articles in magazines</i><br>
<i>&gt;and newspapers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;17. Why was Hiroshima "targeted," and not Tokyo?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps because no one had heard of Hiroshima, and no one knew anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;from there. It would be far more difficult to claim that Tokyo was bombed</i><br>
<i>&gt;than Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In fact, most world maps from before "World</i><br>
<i>&gt;War Two" do not even mention these cities at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;18. How does Japan benefit from the "atom bomb" story?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As a direct result of the "war," Japan has received billions of dollars</i><br>
<i>&gt;worth of US aid for its defense. Japan has essentially no defense</i><br>
<i>&gt;budget, so it can pour resources through MITI into defeating the US</i><br>
<i>&gt;economically, all while playing on the emotions of anti-"nuke" activists</i><br>
<i>&gt;about the "horrors" of nuclear weapons.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;19. Wow, I never thought of that. How else do the Japanese</i><br>
<i>&gt;benefit from this story?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Japanese now own major Hollywood studios, from which many war</i><br>
<i>&gt;movies are produced. Also, they play upon our sympathy for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;supposed "atom bomb" to blind us to the fact that this foreign</i><br>
<i>&gt;nation had taken over our semiconductor industry, many California</i><br>
<i>&gt;banks and practically the entire state of Hawaii. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is all a part of the Japanese plot to take over the world.</i><br>
<i>&gt;According to the "Protocols of the Elders of the Orient," this</i><br>
<i>&gt;is a Japanese conspiracy all foretold by their ancient texts</i><br>
<i>&gt;that very few Anglo-Saxons have the ability to read.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;19. How many people are supposed to have died in the explosions?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is hard to say. Some sources say 60,000 in Hiroshima, others say</i><br>
<i>&gt;140,000. No attempt has been made to rectify the various numbers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;20. How many people die annually from car accidents in the US?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Over 50,000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;21. So, what makes Hiroshima so special?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nothing, especially given the contradictory evidence about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;22. Boy, I'm mad. What should I do about this?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Glad you asked. First, send me lots of money so we can spread this</i><br>
<i>&gt;message far and wide. Maybe we'll take out ads in college newspapers</i><br>
<i>&gt;or something. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Second, direct your anger at the Japanese. We are the victims, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;they are the aggressors. Make yourself feel important again by bashing</i><br>
<i>&gt;Japan at every opportunity. Japanese people are inherently evil, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;basically subhuman. They were never bombed, and if they would have been</i><br>
<i>&gt;they would have deserved it. Who do they think they are, anyway?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, we Revisionists have all the answers. Life is a lot simpler than </i><br>
<i>&gt;you thought it was. Join us, and you won't have to be bothered anymore</i><br>
<i>&gt;by any feelings of guilt for your inherent hatred. We can justify it!</i><br>
<i>&gt;Oh, it's not the Japanese you hate, but the crippled? Hey - so do we!</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's easy: we don't like feeling uncomfortable around people in wheelchairs,</i><br>
<i>&gt;either! Who do they think they are, taking all the good parking spaces</i><br>
<i>&gt;when they were stupid enough to slip on a banana peel? IT'S A </i><br>
<i>&gt;CONSPIRACY! --See how easy it is to start? Now, just mix in a few</i><br>
<i>&gt;real facts, and start converting all of the otherwise messed-up</i><br>
<i>&gt;people to OUR CAUSE!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;23. Wow! You mean that I could write stuff like this, too?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sure! It's embarrasingly easy to write what we wrote above. In fact,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's even superior to the usual anti-Semitic revisionist garbage,</i><br>
<i>&gt;because it has a higher percentage of REAL FACTS! Most of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;apparent "contradictions" above come from the facts that Nagasaki</i><br>
<i>&gt;was bombed by a plutonium bomb, not uranium; and that hydrogen</i><br>
<i>&gt;bombs are thermonuclear, not atomic bombs. Just juggle information</i><br>
<i>&gt;about the different types of bombs and mix them up so they seem to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be contradicting each other. It doesn't take ANY INTELLIGENCE</i><br>
<i>&gt;WHATSOEVER, and you can get lots of free air time on "48 Hours"!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Oh, I forgot to mention: I have a Japanese girlfriend who agrees</i><br>
<i>&gt;with EVERY WORD I've written above. Here she is:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Yes, I am his Japanese girlfriend. I love him very much, and I've</i><br>
<i>&gt;always been troubled by my Japanese friends claiming to know people</i><br>
<i>&gt;who died in Hiroshima."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There you have it! Just throw some unverifiable opinions on top</i><br>
<i>&gt;of ridiculous proofs to STRENGTHEN YOUR CASE! </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;24. Couldn't I be arrested for this?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No! This country is founded on FREE SPEECH! But, just make sure</i><br>
<i>&gt;that you mention how much you are being persecuted for saying</i><br>
<i>&gt;your version of history. (More than three email messages a day</i><br>
<i>&gt;qualify for being called harrassment. Five may merit a lawsuit.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;25. Where can I get more information?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Go to a library. Take a book at random. Skim it. Then, decide how</i><br>
<i>&gt;that book is either for you or against you. If it is for you, quote</i><br>
<i>&gt;liberally and out of context. If against you, do the same. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;DON'T LET YOURSELF GET CONFUSED BY THE FACTS! We certainly don't!</i><br>
