The biggest lesson I have learned while raising kids is that adults<br>
consistently underestimate kid's intelligence and overestimate<br>
their knowledge. I think the reason we do this is that we believe<br>
we are using logic and intelligence in many situations in which<br>
we are actually using memory of past events. Thus when a kid does<br>
something with an unexpected consequence, we think "stupid kid!<br>
Why didn't you infer the consequence!" instead of thinking<br>
"ignorant kid! Why didn't you have experience of this consequence!"<br>
(Aside: please examine our responses to Danny in this light.)<br>
<p>
I apply this bit of hard-earned experience as follows: when a<br>
kid does something "stupid", explain why the action is not<br>
optimal. Don't just say NO!, and don't just lay down a set of<br>
rules without reasons. Where possible, teach a lesson as you<br>
would like to be taught yourself, with examples and visual<br>
aids, not just words. My 14-year-old reminded me of an incident<br>
that happened when she was four. She threw a sharp object at<br>
her younger sister. Apparently, I saw this and first spoke<br>
sharply to her (safety first: I DO yell at kids when there is<br>
imminent danger.) I then explained that the knife could<br>
seriously damage the sister, and asked her to predict what the<br>
knife might do. she wasn't sure, so I used the knife to stab<br>
through a piece of cardboard, and asked her to make a prediction<br>
about the possible effect on her sister. Apparently, she really<br>
got it that time.<br>
<p>
What is the effect of this on the future of humanity? well, if<br>
we often use experience instead of inference, we may want to<br>
do two things: First, we may want to figure out how to apply<br>
inference to more of our actions, or we may want to make<br>
our experience more effective, as we extend our mentation<br>
using computers. To do this effectively, we need to be more<br>
aware of what we are actually doing when we react to a<br>
situation in every-day life.<br>
