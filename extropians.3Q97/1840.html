<p>
Sigh. Do you subscribe to the postmodernist view that scientific<br>
theories are only accepted and spread due to the desires of the power<br>
elites (and not due to any inherent correctness), by any chance?<br>
<p>
What rich and powerful groups were trying to overturn the<br>
intellectual oppression of the Church? There were plenty of people<br>
chafing under it or circumventing it, but given what I know of the<br>
early spread of copies of his work it was not deliberately spread by<br>
some special group trying to use it as a tool to undermine the church<br>
but rather by people having an intellectual interest in cosmology. <br>
Compare this to Luther, who definitely had the support by the rich<br>
and mighty. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ask the Traditionalist Catholic conspiracy theorists, some of whom</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually still claim Copernicus is "unproven"!!!! </i><br>
<p>
Interesting. Does these actually exist? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I was ignoring that, since I don't have the time to make a realistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; model right now. But the model can of course easily be extended to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; finite population, with resistance gradually building up. See any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; standard epidemologic textbook.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Yes, but you are ignoring (again) how early resistance generated by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Establishment can and will stop a new vigorous meme dead in its</i><br>
<i>&gt; tracks if there is enough at stake.</i><br>
<p>
Can you show any example where the Establishment has actually<br>
significantly increased the resistance of any meme, rather than<br>
decreasing its spread by prosecution, enforced ortodoxy and similar<br>
means (which does not really increase the resistance, rather the<br>
transmission)? I suppose a good counter-meme could help this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; what is the evidence that the estabilishment</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cracks down on conspiracy theories more often than other memes?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         The Establishment cracks down on conspiracy memes because</i><br>
<i>&gt; theycan lead to revolution.  Two examples that immediately come to mind:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1.  The anti-John Birch Society hysteria whipped-up the the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Establishment in the late 1950's and early 1960's.  This campaign</i><br>
<i>&gt; bore its fruit in the Goldwater defeat of 1960..... </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2.  The recent media induced witch hunt against conspiracy theorists and </i><br>
<i>&gt; all anti-Statists following what Clinton admits was the fortuitous OKC</i><br>
<i>&gt; bombing.</i><br>
- - -<br>
<i>&gt; Really....there is no problem coming-up with evidence, though</i><br>
<i>&gt; designing a controlled experiment is pretty difficult. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, it is surprising how much history there are and so little usable<br>
*data* (I would really like to have a database where I could ask<br>
questions like "list all military conflicts between democratic<br>
nations" or "plot a histogram of the lifespans of all<br>
civilizations").<br>
<p>
Your above two examples are interesting, since they are both american<br>
modern history (maybe your thesis only applies there?) and both seems<br>
to involve a government crackdown on fring groups on the right. But<br>
we need to compare this to other government crackdowns to see if<br>
conspiracy theories are more persecuted than other theories ("compare<br>
the (government crackdowns on conspiracy theories)/(number of<br>
conspiracy memes) with (government crackdowns on memes)/(number of<br>
memes)"). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      Evidence looks clear to me that the powers that be to remain</i><br>
<i>&gt; so, must and do control memetic infection when the chips are down.</i><br>
<p>
Would you please list this evidence? That the powers that be usually<br>
*try* control the spread of some memes is obvious and well known (I<br>
think there have been *no* nation anywhere, at any time, where it<br>
was allowed to freely spread the meme that the downfall of the government<br>
was a good idea). But your claim is stronger, you claim they actually<br>
have a very firm memetic control. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Just follow the activities of the great Foundations...they spend</i><br>
<i>&gt; most of their money promoting Statist memes!  Just an irrelevancy I</i><br>
<i>&gt; suppose? </i><br>
<p>
How do you become a great foundation? By having great backing. A<br>
revolutionary foundation would not be backed by the government or<br>
other groups profiting from status quo, no need for active memetic<br>
engineering. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Actually, I used to carry the same pluralist memes as you until I</i><br>
<i>&gt; looked at some of the undeniable evidence of ruling class</i><br>
<i>&gt; existence, activity, and dominance around 1967. </i><br>
<p>
I think you are missing my point. Of course there are ruling classes<br>
trying to remain dominant, as an european I am quite aware of that (I<br>
even have some limited insight into their activities through various<br>
sources). But what I disagree with is your view that they are doing<br>
memetic engineering very well, and that they are the dominant factor<br>
in memetic evolution. So far I have not seen you present much<br>
evidence for that. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      The feed back loop through which certain memes increase the</i><br>
<i>&gt; politico- financial power of certain segments of society thereby</i><br>
<i>&gt; increasing the resources available to propagate that meme should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; key in any model of memetic infection. </i><br>
<p>
Now we are getting somewhere! This is just a small extension of<br>
Dawkins model, and it makes a lot of sense. But notice that it is<br>
very different from your initial thesis that the powerful groups are<br>
dominant in memetic evolution; in fact this extension seems to<br>
suggest that they would become memetically unchanging (as they<br>
reach the top, they will not be able to change their memes since<br>
that would decrease their fitness/power) while less powerful groups<br>
would continue to develop new basic memes, co-evolving with each<br>
other and the memetic background of the powerful groups. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Society has very effective defenses against new memes.  These</i><br>
<i>&gt; defenses are financed by big money.  Why do you avoid this aspect? </i><br>
<i>&gt; Huh? </i><br>
<p>
Could you explain what these effective defenses are? The most obvious<br>
defence would be censure, which is the traditional way of a<br>
government to prevent the spread of dangerous memes in certain areas<br>
(and new is often considered dangerous by static societies). But<br>
censure has been ineffective in the long run, as we all know. <br>
Persecuting certain views have usually promoted them. Not teaching<br>
certain memes have done nothing to prevent their spread. So what are<br>
these effective defences? <br>
