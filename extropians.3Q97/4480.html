<i>&gt; packages. for instance, most "free-market" people hate abortion,</i><br>
<i>&gt; women's lib, drug use, and  are (frequently) christian</i><br>
<i>&gt; fundamentalists and creationists. Our first attempt must be to go</i><br>
<i>&gt; behind these "packages". I think the core "socialist values" can</i><br>
<p>
That is a really silly stereotype.  What you described,<br>
"conservatism", has nothing to do with the essence of the true<br>
free market.  The true free market goes beyond the scope of just<br>
economic liberality, embracing BOTH the redeeming virtues of the<br>
"left" AND "right", both social and economic.  In that sense, it<br>
is a "centrist" anarchy.  Unfortunately, there are very, very few<br>
individuals in the world that think this way and also practice it.<br>
<p>
I've witnessed very few (if any at all), "conservative",<br>
"religious", "constitutional" and/or "patriot" types that can<br>
grasp beyond their dogma to a truly free marketplace of all types<br>
of competing ideas.  The same exact problem "liberals" evidence. <br>
So it would be a serious mistake to define "free market" narrowly<br>
or biasedly -- for that is the problem!<br>
<p>
Much to my disapointment, this kind of "centrist" anarchy is never<br>
going to be practical as long as nation-states dominate the planet.<br>
The economies of scale are too great to compete with or defend<br>
against.  Until I evidence otherwise, I lean towards the belief<br>
that social progress of any kind happens only with new technologies<br>
eliminating the status quo.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'd prefer to ask: since the governement exists, and we cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; destroy it next sunday after lunch, how to use it ? I prefer to </i><br>
<i>&gt; see it feed the homeless rather than using my money for army or </i><br>
<i>&gt; making gifts to big corporations....</i><br>
<p>
Just because a fiction is believed to exist doesn't mean it has to<br>
be utilized by anyone personally, especially if they can do<br>
something more efficiently with non-coercion and with more control <br>
over the end results.<br>
<p>
If it isn't an oxymoron, I can think of only one valid reason for<br>
"government" to exist at all: to maintain a monopoly on violence<br>
to prevent competition in that sector.  By using sortition to<br>
select random individuals for the "government" administration, the<br>
free marketplace would provide everything.  This would be true<br>
power to the people.<br>
<p>
As it stands today, "government" is merely a specialist class of<br>
entrenched, intentionally-cultivated individuals acting in their<br>
own self-interest (while saying the opposite).  So I see no<br>
rationalization for these parasites to provide anything at all as<br>
they don't represent my interests (as if they could!) nor the<br>
majority of anyone elses.  The small segment of little parasites<br>
that are their "customers" can be served more cheaply and<br>
efficiently by the free market anyhow. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Uh, really ? don't you do the same cult-like dichotomy by saying</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hitler was a left-wing extremist ? I lurk this list since several</i><br>
<i>&gt; weeks, and I thought that since a clever post by Hagbard/Keith,</i><br>
<i>&gt; nobody here would dare to put the Hitler card on the desk,</i><br>
<i>&gt; especially so quickly....</i><br>
<p>
My point about Hitler was to show how distortions occur because of<br>
dogmatic dichotomies biased in favor of the status quo.  It's a<br>
lot like terrorcrats shuffling paperwork back and forth among<br>
themselves to avoid facing responsibility.  Nothing gets done, no<br>
progress is made, but they all smile smugly together.<br>
