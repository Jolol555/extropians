<i>&gt;  &gt; I've been trying to do the exact same thing.  The problems I find are:</i><br>
trying<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; to be optimistic and still hold the attention of todays audience (who</i><br>
have<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; been made to believe genetic engineering will create mosters and AI's</i><br>
will<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; eat their children) and trying to present highly complex, world changing</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; technologies in a way the audience would understand. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Exactly. Tonight the Lawnmover Man will air on swedish television. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  like the film, it contains several transhuman themes and the graphics</i><br>
<i>&gt;  from Xaos Inc was brilliant when it was made. Still, to tell the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  story the movie *needs* something gone wrong (at least they did not</i><br>
<i>&gt;  use the silly Star Trek idea that superintelligence always leads to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  amoralit - the nasty men in suits wrecked the whole experiment).</i><br>
<p>
Try to avoid The Lawnmower Man 2, they decided to go down the route of "VR's<br>
now so good it looks just like real life" and the whole film consists of kids<br>
pretending to fly in front of a blue screen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Maybe one way of getting tension into a basically transhuman movie</i><br>
<i>&gt;  may be to have a conflict between two reasonable points of view,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  instead of "good guys vs. villains", like (say) transhumanists</i><br>
<i>&gt;  wishing to expand human potential and bring life to the universe, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  environmentalists who want to heal the world and live in harmony with</i><br>
<i>&gt;  nauture (the movie could end with the transhumans moving off-planet</i><br>
<i>&gt;  as "Children of the Sun", leaving it for the "Children of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Earth"), but I think most companies would prefer the tried and tested</i><br>
<i>&gt;  black vs. white theme. </i><br>
<p>
The best way to get a point across is to ignore black and white, and go for a<br>
nice fuzzy grey.  Several themes have crossed my mind:  <br>
<p>
1.  A rebellion against all these 'American President saves the world'<br>
movies.  Instead have a time travelling assassin download himself into<br>
someone's body with the mission of killing the president because of his<br>
opposition to anarchy.  This could lead to a great opportunity of showing the<br>
government through the eyes of someone who's seen better.<br>
<p>
2.  Have a couple of people thaw out of cryonic suspension and go on to<br>
explore the wonderful possibilities of the posthuman world.  Keep the<br>
audience in awe of the possibilities and they might not notice the lack of<br>
good vs. evil.  And then, just when they think it's all over interrupt the<br>
credits with scientific news on actually progress towards these possibilities<br>
(You could also throw in a natural disaster, get them all working towards a<br>
goal).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Another way of showing transhuman themes in an interesting way is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  look at their human consequences. What about a movie about a family</i><br>
<i>&gt;  where a daughter is uploaded after an accident, something like the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  typical movie where the daughter is handicapped and people struggle</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to adapt and understand the situation? </i><br>
<p>
Not exactly the kind of groundbreaking film to alter the perception of the<br>
world though (which I think is what we're aiming for here).<br>
