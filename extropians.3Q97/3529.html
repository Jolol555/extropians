To those with invesment expertise,<br>
<p>
I require maximum liquidity and flexibility in managing my portfolio.<br>
<p>
I heard in passing recently, that you can now buy and trade stocks,<br>
bonds, t-bills, and gold WITHOUT A MIDDLEMAN.  To me this would be<br>
absolutely ideal!  <br>
<p>
Is this possible?<br>
<p>
Also, is there a way (even in the works) of buying and selling in very<br>
small chunks?  In other words, wouldn't it make more sense if the<br>
economy wuld allow invesment in increments of penny's?  For example, I<br>
want to invest $2.36 in Microsoft.  But, as I understand things, you<br>
have to pay at least in blocks of $140 (the price its currently<br>
selling at) or not at all.  This seems to be a very inefficent and<br>
non-fluid restriction and one that favors the rich investor over the<br>
poor one.<br>
<p>
Any thoughts or suggestions?<br>
<p>
Paul<br>
