Dear Anton and other Fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
Anton's comments (below) notwithstanding it is quite easy to enter a tort<br>
(either individually, or as a class action) under most state laws or under<br>
the provisions of the USC. <br>
The regulations that Anton refers to (see: USCRR a/k/a Code of Rules and<br>
Regulations) as well, are not as fixed as he seems to believe. In fact,<br>
one of the reasons that the USCRR is published daily is because rules and<br>
standards are frequently changed as new information, social, economic<br>
and/or technological changes occur or developments become available.   <br>
For those of you who suffer from insomnia, you may wish to read the daily<br>
changes that occur in the USCRR. They are almost guaranteed to put you to<br>
sleep in ten minutes or less or your money back. The same is true of the<br>
NYCRR (I know because I've written some of those regulations). <br>
<p>
Where a taxpayer has a grievence against a governmental body they always<br>
have recourse through the courts. In NY State it's called an Article 78<br>
proceeding. Most other states have similar recourse statutes.<br>
<p>
Respectfully, <br>
<p>

Subject: to regulate pollution<br>

quoth Keith/Hagbard:<br>
: ...  A regulation can arguably make things more<br>
: complex, but seems also to result in an information loss. Take, for<br>
: example, regulations on the emission of toxic gases. When an outsider<br>
: steps in and denotes X units to be the highest legal limit on the<br>
: emission of toxic gas Y, the non-complying actor must either arrest the<br>
: emission by cutting production or acquire a new means of production that<br>
: is in compliance. This increases complexity, but only because another<br>
: actor has entered the picture (the regulation). However, the information<br>
: concerning what is efficient, what is Y's impact upon the environment,<br>
: etc. is lost.<br>
<p>
More specifically, perhaps - when pollution is regulated in<br>
absolute language (thou shalt not emit more than X; thou shalt<br>
not emit any Y at all; thou shalt use technology Z to control<br>
thine emissions, whether or not Z is effective in thy case)<br>
information is lost from the cost/benefit analysis.<br>
<p>
It's hard to measure the costs of pollution, partly because<br>
(if I understand correctly) of a political decision early in<br>
the Industrial Revolution that progress is too important to be<br>
hobbled by liability.  Where people are suing for damages, the<br>
plaintiffs themselves provide abundant information about the<br>
costs of a given practice; but it's very hard to sue for damages<br>
from pollution.<br>
<p>
When the factory is liable for the external costs of pollution,<br>
and has evidence on which to base an estimate of those costs,<br>
it can rationally balance those costs with the costs of adopting<br>
a less-polluting process.<br>
<p>
In environmental policy, though, it's customary to scream<br>
indignantly that *any* pollution is intolerable; in other<br>
words, to insist (falsely) that the costs of pollution are<br>
always infinite.  Well, one infinity equals another, so it's<br>
hard to see how such rhetoric can ever lead to improvement.<br>
