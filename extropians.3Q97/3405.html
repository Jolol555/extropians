<i>&gt;Ahhhhhh.  Sigh.  Alas, to my disappointment, I see that none of</i><br>
<i>&gt;you have been able to see past your own success.  It is obvious</i><br>
<i>&gt;from your posts that most of you live in the valley where success</i><br>
<i>&gt;grows on trees. Take a trip to the Midwest and tell me what you</i><br>
<i>&gt;see.  Most of you remind me of Marie Antoinette when she said "let</i><br>
<i>&gt;them eat cake!". I will try to address everyone's arguments in </i><br>
<i>&gt;this post.</i><br>
<p>
?????<br>
<p>
Here in the Midwest (Chicago) I see a thriving city, new<br>
construction everywhere as former industrial buildings are<br>
converted in giant multiblock tracks into new housing/office space.<br>
I see ever increasing bundles of fiberoptics pulsing with billions<br>
of packets of information per second, money and goods traded at a<br>
rate of over a trillion dollars a day. Help wanted signs<br>
everywhere.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Me:  Absolutely not.  That's why most families need 2 breadwinners</i><br>
<i>&gt;now..</i><br>
<p>
Hmmm, the social dynamic has changed, women are taking their proper<br>
place, on equal par with men, thus overturning millenia of<br>
injustice. In order to have a "better" life many chose to go the<br>
dual income route, it has many advantages.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Me: USA Today.  Job insecurity might be okay for you when you have</i><br>
<i>&gt;an IQ over 140 and computer skills to equip an army.  But what</i><br>
<i>&gt;about the rest of the country who have kids to raise, let alone</i><br>
<i>&gt;having even touched a computer?</i><br>
<p>
They need to start, 10 years ago I knew little about computers<br>
beyond being able to turn one on, now I make my living building,<br>
and troubleshooting global networks. I argue this point with my<br>
Union (Local 134 I.B.E.W) brothers and sisters all the time. In the<br>
new economy, job security comes from being current, from being<br>
relevant, by updating your skills on a minute by minute basis.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Me:  Tell that to the people who have been automated out of a job. </i><br>
<i>&gt;All I'm asking is for you to tell me what people of average IQ,</i><br>
<i>&gt;little money and little skill are going to do when the majority of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the economy has been automated?  Most of these people are not</i><br>
<i>&gt;collected money from mutual funds even if they knew how.  Are you</i><br>
<i>&gt;saying invest money or die?</i><br>
<p>
The idea of automation replacing everyone is an industrial era<br>
paradigm, it didn't happen, and it won't. Besides in a world full<br>
of robots the new jobs will be in robot repair.......<br>
<p>
I loath the school system that taught me nothing about financial<br>
planning, if I had been give something like "The Wealthy Barber" in<br>
grammar school, my life would have been much different. (If I had<br>
listened.... ;) ) As it is I corrected the problem several years<br>
ago and am doing very well by normal standards, and everyone else<br>
can do the same.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My compassion has led me to several projects that have </i><br>
<i>&gt;directly benefited people - including my stint with Habitat for</i><br>
<i>&gt;Humanity and the Peace Corps. </i><br>
<p>
You are to be commended for your generous actions.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Me:  And on that note I bid you all goodnight.  I will login</i><br>
<i>&gt;tomorrow if time allows.</i><br>
