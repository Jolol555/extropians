<i>        &gt;Intercontinental travel will probably remain relatively slow and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;cumbersome for a long time to come,</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Slow relative to what, Star Trek? Travel has never been cheaper in the <br>
history of the human race and it's getting cheaper, but that's nothing <br>
compared to what's happening in communication. Trying to keep people in their <br>
place, in the same little pigeonholes they've been stuck in for centuries is <br>
just not going to work.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;and way beyond the financial capabilities of your "dollar an hour"         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;people. In other words: if you want cheap workers, they'll have to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;live relatively nearby. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Where the people who work for me want to live is up to them not me. Obviously <br>
if they don't like to travel and they don't want to live near me then there  <br>
could be a problem, unless they  tele-commute.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Since most of the good spots are already taken by the more fortunate         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;folk, </i><br>
          <br>
<p>
All spots are only as good as what people make them to be.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;this means heavy concentration in shitty areas, which traditionally         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;are a source of crime and unrest. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
 I remind you that the worst crime of this or any other century was committed <br>
 by a gang of thugs from a white tribe. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Before you know it you'll have apartheid and the like.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Apartheid was precisely why the immigration policy of South Africa caused <br>
unrest. If the law says that you don't have as many rights as I do because  <br>
you have more pigment in your skin than me, then it doesn't take a brain <br>
surgeon to figure out that it will cause unrest.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;As for cultural differences preventing free immigration, if I found         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;a culture to be unpleasant then I wouldn't want to go to that land,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;if I didn't then I  would.  What's the problem?</i><br>
          <br>
<i>       &gt;The problem is others (less "fortunate" than yourself) coming to *you*. </i><br>
          <br>
<p>
As long as I'm not forced by taxes to support these people then I don't see <br>
the "problem", and if they want to come here then they must not dislike my  <br>
culture all that much.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If immigration really was totally free, all successful places would         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;be overrun even faster by masses of poor immigrants (in your case         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;wave upon wave of Mexicans, I guess). </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Today virtually any Mexican who wants to live in the USA can, it's illegal <br>
but  that's a small point. Indeed many Mexicans do just that, they want to <br>
live  here because the welfare is so nice, and this delights me because it's  <br>
destroying the system. If we didn't have welfare then they would only come  <br>
if they could get a job and become productive, and what on Earth is wrong  <br>
with that?<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;In the ever more automated modern society there [is] will simply not         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;be enough work for all these people    </i><br>
    <br>
<p>
Not at minimum wage, but there could be at a dollar an hour, and if not then <br>
they won't come here because there would be no reason for them to do so.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The "private protection agencies" will probably evolve into *states*,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;with their own "turf" (country), "protection money" (taxes) etc. </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
States claim rights that individuals or corporations don't have, even if the  <br>
advantage is small at the beginning they use it to gain more power and soon a <br>
monster has evolved. Private Protection Agencies (PPA) have no rights an <br>
individual doesn't have and if they tried to get more the competing PPA's <br>
would not like it. The aggressive PPA would need a large very expensive army <br>
to enforce its edicts and that means it would have to charge a higher premium  <br>
for its services and that means customers would drop them like a hot potato <br>
and go with another agency, they wouldn't be thrilled about turning their  <br>
front yard into a war zone either. No money no army.<br>
<p>
Also, the leaders of countries tend to the sort of people who like to have <br>
power over people, the CEO of successful private protection agencies would be  <br>
the sort of people who are more interested in making money than  saving face, <br>
if not the stockholders of the agency would be very unhappy, they'd dump him <br>
and find somebody who can make money not glory for them. It's a fact, <br>
stockholders don't give a damn about glory, they want cash. <br>
                  <br>
There is yet another safeguard, the instant a PPA starts acting in a  <br>
totalitarian way, shut off it's money supply, go to a competitor and stop its  <br>
cancerous growth in the bud. That is a powerful tool that we don't have today,  <br>
you are forced to keep sending money to your country even if you hate what  <br>
it's doing.<br>
 <br>
Does all this prove that a PPA can never turn into Big Brother? Of course not, <br>
we're talking about human relationships not something simple like mathematics, <br>
but I think it does show that it would be more unlikely to turn bad than our <br>
present institutions.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;you might end up with a truly medieval "city state" scenario, with         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;bands of thugs roaming the countryside, despotic rulers, lots of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;small wars </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Medieval? It sounds like you're reading the morning newspaper.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You must be wise indeed.</i><br>
<p>
 <br>
Yes, modest too.<br>
