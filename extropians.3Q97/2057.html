This message describes an amazing concept I came up with recently.  I<br>
haven't worked out all the details, but if it's true it would be very cool.<br>
<p>
Consider an advanced civilization/organism, that has converted all the<br>
planets in the solar system into a Dyson sphere.  That's all very well, but<br>
isn't it inconvenient that 99.9% of the mass of the system hasn't been put<br>
to good use?  It's just sitting there, being a very inefficient fusion<br>
generator.  How can we dismantle it, so we can get it to give up its energy<br>
faster, and extract some useful materials from it?  Here's how!  <br>
<p>
Remember that message I sent out a few weeks ago, about how you could build<br>
a device that could hover indefinitely in the atmosphere of the Sun?  Well,<br>
consider this: such devices could be made self-reproducing, so they could<br>
cover much of the area of the Sun, and then used to extract raw materials<br>
from the substance of the Sun.  The Sun is currently 75% hydrogen, 24%<br>
helium, and 1% other stuff, mostly carbon, oxygen and nitrogen.  The<br>
hydrogen and helium are so abundant as to be valueless, so we leave them.<br>
The heavier elements can be extracted to build more Dyson sphere.  <br>
<p>
The cool thing is that we can extract from the atmosphere two isotopes that<br>
are both fairly abundant and have what astrophysicists call 'fragile<br>
nuclei', meaning that they are good fuels for fusion reactions.  The two<br>
isotopes are helium-3 and nitrogen-15.  These are lousy fuels compared to<br>
deuterium and tritium, which is what all fusion bombs and reactors have used<br>
to date, but all the deuterium and tritium in the Sun burned up long ago.<br>
<p>
The outer layer of the Sun is swirling around, constantly bringing new<br>
material to the surface.  This layer has about 70% of the volume of the Sun,<br>
and 10% of the mass.  So the extraction machines at the surface can go on<br>
for a long time before running out of stuff to process.  After a few hundred<br>
thousand years, we will have extracted most of the helium-3 and nitrogen-15<br>
in the swirly part of the Sun (the core of the Sun is non-swirly and doesn't<br>
mix with the outside).  This will amount to a ball about the size of the<br>
Earth.  <br>
<p>
This ball is the mother of all fusion bombs.  Unfortunately, unlike the<br>
regular kind, it burns relatively slowly.  It needs something to hold it<br>
together while it burns up.  I spent a long time designing impractical<br>
systems of crashing planets and self-imploding bombs before I realized that<br>
there is one place in the Solar system where there is enough pressure to<br>
hold the bomb together while it burns: the center of the Sun.  And the heat<br>
of the Sun can provide a handy ignition source.<br>
<p>
One of the problems with using the Sun for heat and pressure is that it is<br>
very springy: any increase in fusion rate at the center will increase the<br>
pressure, which will cause the Sun to expand, which will cool the gas,<br>
causing the heat production to slow.  You can get around this by mixing some<br>
lead with the fusion fuel, forming degenerate matter, which does not expand<br>
when the temperature increases, and is also a good insulator at these<br>
temperatures, so the heat will tend to stay confined in the bomb until<br>
burning is complete.<br>
<p>
How to get the bomb to the center of the Sun?  I suggest wrapping it in a<br>
few thousand miles of inert, abundant stuff (say aluminum and silicon) and<br>
then just dropping the whole ball in.  The Sun is, after all, gas all the<br>
way down, and much less dense than the bomb, so according to my calculations<br>
the bomb should   fall to the core in about half an hour.  Just how much of<br>
the outer layers gets stippped off by air resistance on the way is hard to<br>
know; such calculations are at the cutting edge of present-day astrophysics.<br>
<p>
So, having dropped the bomb to the center of the Sun, we wait for it to go<br>
off.  For several weeks, fusion proceeds at a relativly sedate pace, as the<br>
bomb slowly gets hotter and hotter.  The hotter it gets, the faster it<br>
burns, etc, until it finally burns most of its mass in a tiny fraction of a<br>
second.  This heats the lead enough to un-degeneratize it, this lets it<br>
expand, and the entire Sun is given a mighty kick in the butt (well, the<br>
core, but you get the idea).<br>
<p>
The shock wave propagates out to the surface and either blows off a few<br>
percent of the mass of the Sun or merely inflates the Sun to twice normal<br>
size for a few hundred thousand years.  But wait, you say, that's all?  I<br>
thought you were going to actually blow up the entire Sun!  Well, don't<br>
worry, that's the next step.<br>
<p>
Remember how ony the outer 10% of the Sun's mass was accesible from the<br>
surface?  Well, now that the deep interior has been mightily heated,<br>
convection will make the entire depth of the Sun swirly, and all of it will<br>
eventually come to the surface.  99% of the Sun's helium-3 was down below<br>
the layer we could reach before.  Now it will be brought up to the surface,<br>
where we can build the grandmother of all fusion bombs with it.  This one is<br>
about the size of Uranus.  We drop that in, wait a few weeks, and KABOOM!<br>
The Sun is history.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the resulting gas cloud, we build lots of Jupiter Brains and all live</i><br>
happily ever after until the Big Crunch.  But that's another story...<br>
<p>
--CarlF <br>
<p>
PS. What's the reliability of this scheme?  Well, I read a few books on the<br>
topic of thermonuclear astrophysics, the Sun and stellar interiors.  The<br>
fusion rate calculations I'm pretty confident of, the degenerate matter<br>
stuff is so-so, and the air resistance calculation is an extrapolation from<br>
the current behavior of the Sun, which amounts to a wild guess.  I'm<br>
confident that the Sun contains enough fusion fuel to blow it to<br>
smithereens, so the problem is simply one of releasing the energy fast<br>
enough and in the right place.<br>
