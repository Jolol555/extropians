I've discussed this with Eliezer before, and I still don't<br>
understand his acute desire to arrange for people other than<br>
himself to live their lives the way he thinks they ought to.<br>
<p>
A crackhead who refrains from violence and theft is not someone<br>
I want to mess with.<br>
<p>
A crackhead who engages in violence and theft merits getting<br>
messed with not because he is a crackhead, but because he<br>
engages in violence and theft.<br>
<p>
I sure hope Eliezer doesn't cook up something in his basement<br>
lab that will destroy the economy of the northern Andes, or<br>
he's going to have a lot on his conscience, and it probably<br>
won't be very pleasant for him when he realizes just what he's<br>
unleashed.<br>
