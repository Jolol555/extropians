<p>
Do you know why Foresight has chosen these criteria (including the<br>
nanoscale computational device) as the realization of Feynman's vision?<br>
Is it that these criteria represent the "final step" so-to-speak?  <br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt; (out of my ballpark...)<br>

Thanks for your response. <br>
<p>
My observation in all this is that given the typically reactionary<br>
nature of law and legal thought (i.e., "lack of vision"), the regulatory<br>
schema as it exists today will not be able to cope with the technology<br>
and its many varied implications (which are, for all practical and<br>
historical purposes, just around the corner). Without assigning a<br>
normative value to the demise of regulation in our society, it is a<br>
topic that I want to explore in some depth.  <br>
<p>
We have a course entitled Science and the Law here at school. Elsewhere,<br>
there exists theoretical applied science. Why not Theoretical Applied<br>
Science and the Law? IMHO intelligent people need to know about this<br>
technology and its implications. One of the most misdirected group of<br>
intelligent people is the legal community. Call it "tunnel-vision",<br>
"careerism", or whatever, lawyers and law professors, judges and<br>
legislators (with exceptions) have an overblown percpetion of their<br>
importance in the grand scheme of things. There is nothing worse than a<br>
regulation based upon imperfect information. The process of regulation<br>
is a slow evolution rooted in trial-and-error. If the pace of change<br>
antecedent to nanotech will be as fast as many believe, and rightfully<br>
so, the time-frame for this process is drastically reduced and thus,<br>
there exists less time to consider the effects of the regulation. <br>
<p>
Which is bad news for everyone.<br>
<p>
Nanotech will be regulated, I am certain. My hope is that the<br>
regulations will correctly balance the risk-return equation.  <br>
<p>
