<i>&gt; What is picotechnology?</i><br>
<p>
I infer from Ander's post that "picotechnology" is "control<br>
of matter to subatomic precision.", by analogy with<br>
nanotechnology: control of matter to atomic precision.<br>
<p>
The etymology is a bit strange: "micro-technology"<br>
relates to very small machines. The word "nanotechnology"<br>
is almost a pun. The prefix "micro" has a non-scientific<br>
meaning of "tiny", but it also has a specific ISO-standard<br>
meaning of 10E-6, or "one millionth". "Nano" means 10E-9,<br>
or "one part in a thousand million", and "pico" means 10E-12,<br>
or "one part in a million million." So, Anders is extending the<br>
pun: if nanotechnology is "tinier than microtechnology", then<br>
picotechnology is "tinier than nanotechnology".<br>
<p>
My post was assuming an ability to do mechanicla engineering<br>
of neutronium, which is (or may be) atoms with their electrons<br>
crushed nearly into the nucleus by ambient pressure  with<br>
roughly a thousand-fold reduction in size. Anders is not<br>
sure this will work, but has hopes for operating at the<br>
quark level which would result in an additional thousand-fold<br>
reduction, but which IMO would require discovery of new<br>
physical laws.<br>
