Robin Hanson says:<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Listening to Greg Stock at Extro 3 I formed this hypothesis: that what</i><br>
<i>&gt;most unites us is a conviction that within a century (or two at most)</i><br>
<i>&gt;the world will be a VERY different place. [...]</i><br>
<p>
Hmm...  I became an extropian before munching on the idea of the<br>
singularity.  BUT.  I've always contrasted extropians with...50's<br>
futurists.  You know, domed cities, flying cars, plastic clothing,<br>
cities on mars, rockets going everywhere, videophones, robot-tended<br>
farms (or hydroponics), fusion reactors...<br>
<p>
I think what we have is a tendency to trace basic changes through<br>
to radical ramifications.  What "50's futurists" do is more like<br>
linear extrapolation.  Also, they seem(ed) to think as if things in the<br>
future will just be more rational ways of doing things we do now.<br>
As if change were something brought to us by the experts in Housing,<br>
Transportation, Communication, etc., finding more efficient ways to<br>
do their jobs.  "A big machine to make big decisions, programmed by<br>
fellas of compasion and vision," as Donald Fagan sings.<br>
<p>
We look at causes--basic technologies, market forces, evolution,<br>
information transfers--instead of just extrapolating trends in<br>
results and finished products.<br>
<p>
So, I think our tendency to see future strangeness is a result of a<br>
deeper difference in the way we look at change.  Bottom-up futurists<br>
are tipped-applecart futurists.<br>
<p>
There was a jump from not having an idea of progress to the idea of<br>
progress.  Progress was gradual and good for us people.<br>
<p>
Then there was futurism, the idea that change was happening soon enough<br>
that we ought to think about it seriously.  Here the idea was to make<br>
choices at the forks in this road we're progressing along.<br>
<p>
The difference between Futurists and Extropians may be the<br>
suspicion that formerly abstract or theoretical topics--evolution, the<br>
structure of molecules, arrangement of matter as information,<br>
number theory, quantum mechanics--will have a more forceful and<br>
immediate effect on our own futures than human social structures,<br>
needs and activities.<br>
<p>
Of course the difference could result from a *willingness* to consider<br>
strangeness, not shying from it.  I'm not sure but I don't think so.<br>
Consider 50's science fiction readers.  Definitely neophiles,<br>
strangophiles, but not extropians.<br>
<p>
It's the tendency to extropolate.<br>
