Hi!<br>
<p>
Many of you seem bothered and annoyed by my messages. Although that<br>
wasn't my intention, I apologize and I would like to mention that this<br>
will, hopefully, be my last message on this subject, this is an<br>
Extropian list and this subject is not even directly related to<br>
Exrotpism. I would still like to clarify a few of my positions that I<br>
think were not well interpreted. To avoid any further messages, I won't<br>
comment on any of your replies unless they are useful for my own<br>
conclusions.<br>
<p>
First, you were very surprised, perhaps even mad by my ideas about human<br>
nature.<br>

<i>&gt; Constantly?  Speak for yourself.</i><br>
<p>
I'm very aggressive and determined but I'm not a violent person. I'm<br>
actually very peaceful. Anyone who knows me, claims that I am the<br>
coolest, most calm driver on earth and since Portuguese drivers are<br>
considered the worst in Europe, that's a big complement. I never engaged<br>
in a fight and never picked up a gun in my life. Perhaps if I was in the<br>
middle of Bosnia I would be violent, who knows, but as I am now, I'm not<br>
violent.<br>

<i>&gt; What a hideous, depressing view of humanity.  I can't speak for you</i><br>
<i>&gt; personally, but /I/ don't murder because /I/ personally find the act</i><br>

<i>&gt; that the all the truly large-scale brutal mass murders are perpetrated</i><br>
<i>&gt; by armies, under the auspices of a government, not by individuals.</i><br>
<p>
You mention one important word, History. You want to see the conclusive<br>
proof to my claims about human nature? Look at the human history of the<br>
last 10'000 years. The human gene pool is roughly the same for the past<br>
100'000 years which means that the gene pool of Canadians (the country<br>
in the world with the best quality of life, according to my last<br>
statistics) is the same of the ruthless troops of Napoleon or the<br>
British army that destroyed villages one after the other in it's<br>
imperialistic conquest. You want to see how life was with no penalies<br>
for murder? I can write to you some stories of the Dark Ages in Europe,<br>
you want to hear what was life for Portuguese farmers in the 14/15th<br>
centuries or can you just imagine?. Do you think that the German people<br>
have been genetically mutated since the holocaust? The genes are the<br>
same, the difference is in education, in memes.<br>
You say that armies are the mass murders and not individuals. You are<br>
just telling me I'm right, murderers, just like peaceful persons are a<br>
result of education and not genetic causes (with a few, sporadic,<br>
exceptions). The German army had to work much to make it's soldiers to<br>
kill the Jews, remember that the Germans had an education and the army<br>
had to destroy the compassion German soldiers had in order to use them.<br>
The pure human nature, without education can be seen in a state of<br>
anarchy. Inform yourself about the Dark Age or about human life on Earth<br>
when civilization was not yet established. Civilization prevents the<br>
expression of the true human nature by education, by culture.<br>
You can argue, most persons are not violent. I might even agree (most<br>
women are much less violent than men) but even that only a minority is<br>
violent in the start (let's imagine a sudden abolition of death penalty<br>
in the US), the others would soon realize that this was the best course<br>
of action (even the most peaceful ones!). I see people insulting<br>
themselves for small reasons, I see men (yes, men are the main cause of<br>
violence) fighting for practically nothing. As soon as the judicial<br>
system falls, violence is a reality (except, perhaps, in Canada and<br>
other nations with few social problems), just look at Rwanda. Mail me<br>
privately and I'll send a dozen of cases (from peaceful Americans who<br>
were 'carried away' during the riots, ex-Nazi soldiers, stories of the<br>
conquest of America and the slaughter of natives, civil societies before<br>
1 AD, etc).<br>
<p>
I don't know (or knew) what negative feedback is, some of you also<br>
disliked this, I still don't understand why, Anton Sherwood wrote:<br>
<i>&gt; Be fair, `negative feedback' is a term of art that probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; isn't in an English-Portuguese dictionary.  I understood</i><br>
<i>&gt; the principle long before I knew what the phrase means.</i><br>
<p>
There is actually a phenomenon called feedback inhibition that occurs in<br>
enzymes but from there to knowing what negative feedback is, with only a<br>
few knowledge of economy, goes a long way.<br>
<p>
As for economy, your arguments haven't convinced me that free-markets<br>
are the best solution, on the contrary, they convinced me that<br>
free-markets aren't a wise solution. Anyway, I shall not discuss this<br>
subject again on the list. <br>
<p>
Other thing that seem to have bothered was my lack of knowledge and my,<br>
primitive, questions. Michael Lorrey wrote:<br>
<i>&gt; Doesn't anyone read books anymore?  Why do so many people on the net ask</i><br>
<i>&gt; elementary questions which are much more satisfactorily answered by</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to the basic literature rather than by a flurry of incomplete or</i><br>
<i>&gt; sketchy net responses? Who wants to spend time typing in elementary</i><br>
<i>&gt; introductions to basic libertarian thought?</i><br>
<p>
I haven't counted all the replies I received but apparently some do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It all comes down to individuals taking responsibility for their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; education, and respect for others. What do you think the secretary of</i><br>
<i>&gt; state would say if you walked into a Cabinet meeting and asked a basic</i><br>
<i>&gt; question about the Presidency?</i><br>
<p>
First, the secretary of state would need, unlike myself, to know basic<br>
things, that's his job, that's what he's paid for. Second, I sent a<br>
simple message with a few questions, some persons had the time to answer<br>
them. If you really think I shown no respect, I apologize but I don't<br>
believe you've spent more than 10 seconds to read the start of my<br>
message (where it was obvious that I had simple questions) and erase it.<br>
If, in those 10 seconds, I made you lose some important business, some<br>
great touchdown or your dinner got cold, I apologize.<br>
On a personal basis, I don't mind talking about subjects that are<br>
interesting to me for hours, I don't mind answering all the questions in<br>
the world. Obviously some of you are different, once again, if I caused<br>
any pain to anyone with my message, I apologize. Please note that this<br>
only applies to my first message, the others are just responses to the<br>
responses of persons who had time to answer my questions.<br>

<p>
My reply to Michael Lorry can be basically applied to you but I would<br>
also like to add that insults usually don't make persons do what you<br>
want. Well, at least that's my opinion but, probably unlike you, I'm not<br>
used to insulting other persons so I'm also a bit ignorant in this<br>
subject.<br>
<p>
Thank you all for your replies,<br>
