<i>&gt;&gt;terribly difficult it is to cope with progress and competition in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;computers?  Continuous upgrading seems to be the norm.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think the progress on the hardware side has been great. However, if </i><br>
<i>&gt;there wasn't continuous upgrading then Microsoft and Intel (Wintel) </i><br>
<i>&gt;would go out of business.  Microsoft comes out with a new, more bloated </i><br>
<i>&gt;version of their software, and Intel in turn has to come out with a new </i><br>
<i>&gt;and faster chip for it to run on.  </i><br>
<p>
Aren't you contradicting yourself here?  In fact, advances in software<br>
possibilities drive advances in hardware, and advances in hardware drive<br>
advances in software.  Both ways, it's a good thing on the whole.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Have you ever noticed that it takes </i><br>
<i>&gt;Windows 95 longer to load on a Pentium than Win 3.1 on a early version </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the 486?  If you consider Windows 95 progress then you haven't really </i><br>
<i>&gt;fathomed the potential software that could really be done on these </i><br>
<i>&gt;supercomputer chips we now posses. </i><br>
<p>
I''ve got no more than an ordinary end-users smattering of knowledge of<br>
computers, but it seems to me that despite its faults, Win95 is a<br>
definite advance on Win 3.1 in terms of ease of use, speed of running<br>
programs, and multitasking capability.  I *have* spent the occasional<br>
day or two tearing my hair out over some problem, but then I expected<br>
that when I got a computer, because the need for backwards-compatibility<br>
and the many different manufacturers of ever snazzier hardware and<br>
software having slightly different standards means that there will *<br>
always* be problems.  In fact come to think of it, most of the<br>
complaints of the kind you make seem to forget that a lot of the reason<br>
for Win95's 'bloatedness' is caused by these things, plus the requirement<br>
that the PC ought to be operatable by even relatively stupid people. <br>
This last requirement is never quite fulfillable, of course, precisely<br>
because it requires a bloated, complex program that is prone to the<br>
occasional problem! :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Microsoft and Intel are in bed </i><br>
<i>&gt;together to insure future business and market share. If you have not </i><br>
<i>&gt;noticed this, then you must be kidding!</i><br>
<p>
I'm sure they are.  And if they keep on making stuff people are prepared<br>
to buy, they will ensure future business and market share.  So what? <br>
The fact also remains that if they don't they won't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;The only way corporations can possibly coerce is by means of </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;government.  When people say 'corporate coercion' in the usual sense, it's just</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;another whine.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I definitly have to disagree here.  Lets me diverge for a moment.  I </i><br>
<i>&gt;consider myself an anarchist.  A "true" anarchy is where individuals can </i><br>
<i>&gt;do anything they want as long as it dosen't interfere with anothers </i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom.  If an individual or group of individuals grabs a bunch of arms </i><br>
<i>&gt;and starts terrorizing the rest of the people in this "anarchy" into </i><br>
<i>&gt;submission, then we no longer have "anarchy" but a new form of </i><br>
<i>&gt;authoritarianism..  Now back to corporations... </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's corporations that are increasingly requiring piss tests to get a </i><br>
<i>&gt;job.  Imagine if you had to take a random piss test from the government </i><br>
<i>&gt;just to stay in "good citizen" status and not be thrown in jail!  Please </i><br>
<i>&gt;don't misunderstand me, I'm not defending government in any way.  What I </i><br>
<i>&gt;am saying however, is that a corpocracy is not a free-market.  </i><br>
<p>
A piss test for taking a job is the employer's privilege.  That is<br>
completely different from govt., because the govt. in no way *owns* the<br>
country.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A good </i><br>
<i>&gt;example was in the early part of this century when Rockefeller would </i><br>
<i>&gt;open up a new gas stations next to small independent operators.  When </i><br>
<i>&gt;one of his stations first opened they would charge less then wholsale </i><br>
<i>&gt;prices until the other guy COULD NO LONGER COMPETE and go out of </i><br>
<i>&gt;business.  As soon as the small-time operator went out of business, </i><br>
<i>&gt;Rockefeller would raise the price of gas higher than the small-time guy </i><br>
<i>&gt;was originally operating at.  If you consider this practice fair-game in </i><br>
<i>&gt;a Free-Market economy, then I will have to take serious odds with the </i><br>
<i>&gt;whole concept of a "Free-Market" as you are presenting it.</i><br>
<p>
This is not an example of *coercion* as I think of it, except in a *very<br>
* loose sense of the word.  It is a dirty practice, and it ought to<br>
be*morally* condemned, but since it doesn't involve force or the threat<br>
of force it does not require the use of force to correct.<br>
<p>
Also, the bigger operator is still losing money if s/he undercuts; the<br>
bigger s/he is the more money they lose, so in the *long run*, such<br>
monopolies are unsustainable.  I'm sure Michael or Daniel or Eric would<br>
be able to explain this better than I.<br>
<p>
Sorry, nothing you have said persuades me that a free market would<br>
prevent competition from occurring.<br>
