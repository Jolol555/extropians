In a message dated 97-09-10 22:02:49 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So today's poor are richer than yesterday's poor.  That's the point.</i><br>
<p>
That is still quite contradictory. The proper way to view this may be stated<br>
as:   the standard of living has been raised. No one can convince me that the<br>
"poor" ( which in common semantics means a life without proper shelter,<br>
medical care and adequate food) give a damn if we chose to think of them as<br>
"richer" than the starving homeless who lived in medieval times. It will not<br>
make their lives any richer. Not only that- to use that line of thinking to<br>
ignore the truth of that reality, to NOT acknowledge their very real<br>
experience of starving to death, is denial of the worst sort, and IMO<br>
downright mean. <br>
One could also say stupid people of today are much smarter than the stupid<br>
people of yesterday. It is meaningless.  <br>
Of course, people are far less ignorant today, but  the knowledge required to<br>
live is much more complex, and specialized,  so if people cannot raise their<br>
level of ignorance  and stay just below the amount required to deal with this<br>
new and complex environment, they will still not be able to function very<br>
well. They will suffer from it. The bottom is still the bottom. Starving is<br>
still starving. Stupid is still stupid. <br>
<p>
....still full of love, <br>
