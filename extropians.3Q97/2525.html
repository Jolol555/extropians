Certainly, but the amount of chemical energy contained in a <br>
medium-sized forest, for example, is enormous. The cost of a few <br>
tonnes of TNT to a nanopower is like the cost of Mars bar <br>
to a billionair.<br>

<p>
By getting up very early in the morning, before anyone else was <br>
awake. But seriously, the point is that it could happen so fast that <br>
nobody has time to do anything about it before its too big to be <br>
obliterated with bombs etc. But Ido  agree that it's important to <br>
think in terms of processes (i.e. not forgetting the genesis problem <br>
-how could anything *become* that way?)<br>

<i>&gt; A nanite invading an organism</i><br>

<p>
That organism would itself be floating in an aqueous environment <br>
being glommed by nanites from all directions, unless your immune <br>
system were global to begin with...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; how is the current world going to turn into isolated</i><br>
<i>&gt; castles in a sea of goo?</i><br>
<p>
By the nanites eating up everything that is not protected by a global <br>
nano-immune system; we assumed that there were no such system.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; } But those communication lines are on the outside of your organism. </i><br>
<i>&gt; } You would need an immune system that extends all over the place and </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, you need artillery.</i><br>
<p>
Are you proposing that you are going to sit on the roof of your <br>
bunker and hold the nanites back with a canon?<br>
