Actually, I do have a good idea of what real depression is, although<br>
I have not had the misfortune of experiencing it personally. When I<br>
used the expression "felt depressed" above, I did not mean depressed<br>
in the clinical DSM-IV way, but depressed in the everyday sense<br>
(which is dreadfully common). Anton is of course correct in pointing<br>
out that cognitive tricks like the one I described doesn't work as<br>
well for clinical depression as for normal feelings of depression<br>
(although similar ideas are used quite successfully in cognitive<br>
therapy). <br>

I'm happy to hear that. I think this demonstrates the most important<br>
thing with curing depression: it is a vicious circle, and if you can<br>
get out of it you have a good chance of staying out of it. Whether<br>
the tools of breaking the vicious circle are biochemical or cognitive<br>
doesn't really matter, use whatever works best. <br>
<p>
IMHO the debate about drugs vs. psychology is silly; both are ways of<br>
influencing the same complex neurochemical cognitive patterns in our<br>
brains, and I don't subscribe to the idea that drugs or therapies<br>
just cure the symptoms. In the mind feedback often makes symptoms<br>
into causes. <br>
