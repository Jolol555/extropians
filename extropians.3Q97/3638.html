     Eliezer cited:<br>
     <br>
     But you!  You, Holly Pearson!  You, Rick Knight!  What have *you* done <br>
     for the poor?  What have you even tried to do?<br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight responds:<br>
     <br>
     My decision, after some years of angst, talking (fretting/whining) <br>
     about things I *felt* unable to change is that I am taking steps to <br>
     create an abundance of resources in my life, learn the information I <br>
     need to take control back over my own life and resources.  Rather than <br>
     (or in addition to) the money I send out to organizations or hand out <br>
     spontaneously to individuals, I will use influence (likely artistic) to <br>
     change attitude and heighten awareness.  I observe that more and more <br>
     artists are doing this and it is encouraging.  I no longer choose to be <br>
     overwhelmed by the drastic state of the world.  I move the stones in <br>
     front of me.  I doubt that it is my call to build a machine or a system <br>
     that is a grand solution but I no I can sure as hell evangelize it when <br>
     I see it!<br>
     <br>
     And Eliezer, breathe dude.  I request that you observe that sometimes <br>
     peoples' feelings get in the way of their ability to be profoundly <br>
     cognitive.  Hysteria can sometimes use a brisk slap in the face.  I <br>
     don't regard any of my reflections during this post as such.  Being <br>
     singled out as ineffectual does not make it so, nor does it compel me <br>
     to align with your vision, which I presume is what you'd ideally like.<br>
     <br>
     I'm inclined to think that your response (is it valid to regard it as <br>
     an "outburst") has much more to do with the personal reverberations of <br>
     the suffering of those in your family.  Any person not personally <br>
     affiliated with the attrocities of genocide can't begin to comprehend <br>
     it, just as a person who has not been sexually abused can't comprehend <br>
     the mind-fuckedness one endures.  But the distinction for those who <br>
     survive and learn from such horrible events is how resiliant they are. <br>
     How what they've learned has illuminated them, made them stronger (not <br>
     angrier per se).  Otherwise, the victims have died completely in vain.<br>
     <br>
     For what its worth (which is likely nil), being a 50's baby-boomer <br>
     gentile, I spent the day in bed, relatively numb, after seeing <br>
     Schindler's List.  So, any thinking, feeling human is mal-affected by <br>
     the madness of it all.  But, it's at that point, when I still defer <br>
     to the more mystical notions for meaning...and comfort.  I hope there <br>
     is some equivalent for that in your world to give you peace and <br>
     comfort to weather through your pain.<br>
     <br>
     Good night...<br>
     Rick<br>
