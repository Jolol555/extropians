<p>
Many people simply refuse to admit that they *do* understand, claiming<br>
stupidity is a great way to not have to think about things.  This is<br>
something I refuse to accept, I have always believed that if I do not<br>
understand something it's because I do not have enough information on the<br>
subject.  I don't think genetic stupidity is as abundant as the masses would<br>
have us believe.  It's such a waste of much-needed brain power.<br>
