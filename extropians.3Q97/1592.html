Well..<br>

No.<br>

I know several counterexamples to your statement.  You should visit Silicon<br>
Valley or LA (the centers of extropianism) sometime.  They're both<br>
multiracial, and becoming more so each year.<br>
<p>
You're really stepping on one of my pet peeves - claims unsupported (actually<br>
contradicted) by evidence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Suggestions of meme and gene equality are rediculous delusions,</i><br>
<i>&gt;wishful thinking or outright *lies*.</i><br>
<p>
Well, nobody here has said that all memes or all genes are equal.  I've<br>
simply pointed out that you haven't any evidence to support you claim that<br>
they are correlated with skin color or ancestral geographic origin at 3000<br>
BC.  On theoretical grounds, I'd expect Africans, who have the longest<br>
experience with the most complex environment on earth (lots of people) , to<br>
have the best genes on average.  In practice, we just don't have enough<br>
variation between huamn groups to anticipate big differences.  Culture is<br>
what counts.  The Europeans of which you're so enamoured came very close to<br>
falling for the bunkum of facism and communism just this century.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Not all memes are "attainable" for all people. If this were the case,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the transhuman/extropian meme would have spread like wildfire</i><br>
<i>&gt;and would by now dominate the world, because it is the most *rational* </i><br>
<i>&gt;one by far. </i><br>
<p>
Did you miss my recent post on conspiracy theory where I said that memes are<br>
rarely selected on the basis of their truth?  Aside from that, nobody has yet<br>
significantly extended their life or built a nanotech machine, or<br>
significantly exceeded human norms by cyborgization.  It's perfectly rational<br>
to disbelieve their immanence and worry about other things instead.<br>
