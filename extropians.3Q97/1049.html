&lt;&lt; &gt; Actually the planet has been growing, when the planet was one land mass,<br>
it<br>
<i> &gt; was 80% the size of what it is today.  They can tell by the way the</i><br>
<i> &gt; continents fit.</i><br>

 micheal said:<br>
Danny, the continental plates may only cover 80% of the earth's area<br>
 (which I doubt), but the rest is taken up by the pacific and indian<br>
 ocean plates which are subducting under the North American, SOuth<br>
 American, Australian, and Asian plates. If what you suggest is true,<br>
 then we would have a much greater meteoric impact record than we do and<br>
 be living under much greater greenhouse conditions. Thus only the<br>
 continental plates have grown as divergence continued, but those growing<br>
 plates rode over older plates that subducted under them.<br>
 <br>
 20% of the earth's surface covers a volumebelow it in a cone shape to<br>
 the core of approximately 25 billion cubic miles. Given that Pangea  was<br>
 in existence as late as a couple hundred million years ago, we would<br>
 have to be seeing around 100 cubic miles of meteoric accretion to our<br>
 planet EVERY YEAR to equate to a 20% increase in earth's surface area.<br>
 As this is obviously not true, then the idea that our earth's surface is<br>
 20% greater than in the time of Pangea is ludicrous. We would have to<br>
 experience the equivalent of 10 Yucatan extinction asteroids every year.<br>
 This obviously would have exterminated life...a long, long time ago.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
No, Im saying the whole planet was 80% the size that it is now.  And<br>
scientists can tell this by the way the continents fit right now. When you<br>
put them together there are spaces between them which grow in size the<br>
further north and south you go, but this space is no longer there when you<br>
shrink the whole planet to 80% of what it is now, then they fit perfectly.<br>
