We will of course never have an "ideal" world government, but we <br>
should be willing to pay a high prise in terms of inefficiency if <br>
that will reduce the risk of total annihilation.<br>
<p>
What are your grounds for thinking that a reformed, democratic United <br>
Nations would provoke and escalate mote disputes than it would <br>
settle?<br>
<p>
Many wars seem to originate in differing interpretations of some <br>
legal or historical circumstance. I have often thought, oh, if there <br>
only were an impartial arbiter to which the rivalling nations could <br>
submit their cases, and a responsible international force that <br>
could implement the judgements.<br>
<p>
The only realistic candidates in the foreseeable future are either the <br>
UN or a coalition led by the USA. I think it is dubious that most <br>
people would accept the USA as an international Dad in the long run. <br>
I would suggest a reformed UN in which the USA and the other powers <br>
had an influence that were in some proportion to their real power. <br>
This would presumably also lead to an inefficient bureaucracy that <br>
wastes a few billion dollars per year, but so what?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nicholas, were these thoughts by any chance sparked by Eric Drexler's</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extro-3 after-dinner quotation from Leon Trotsky? "You may not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; very interested in war, but war is very interested in you!" or</i><br>
<i>&gt; something like that.</i><br>
<p>
No, these are issues I have long been worried about. Drexler <br>
has told me that he intentionally de-emphasises the darker scenarios <br>
in his speeches and publications for strategic reasons. One <br>
of the reasons why Drexler is the person that I admire perhaps more <br>
than anybody else is that he has not only realized how good the <br>
future could be if things go well but he is also fully aware of how <br>
serious the risks are.<br>
