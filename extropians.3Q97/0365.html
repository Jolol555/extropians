<i>&gt; &gt;To give all of them protection under the Law, without they as</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I disagree strongly with this line of thought for a number of reasons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First, it is simply not true.  High-level officers *can* be held</i><br>
<i>&gt; accountable for the actions of the corporatiion.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Accountable, yes. Liable, probably not. <br>
<p>
Let's say that an airline company experienced a string of crashes.<br>
Later, it comes to light that the CEO had ordered a cutback of<br>
maintenance personnel. The lawsuits pour in.<br>
<p>
The basic standard is that the director or officer must behave as a<br>
reasonably prudent person would behave in similar circumstances. There<br>
is no such thing as an "accommodation" or "dummy" director. If a person<br>
sits on a board, he automatically (and non-waivably) bears the burden of<br>
acting with due care. <br>
<p>
However, liability for breach of the duty of due care is generally<br>
imposed only when the director or officer behaves "recklessly" or with<br>
"gross negligence." (Example: D, a director, fails to attend board<br>
meetings, fails to read financial reports, fails to obtain the advice of<br>
a lawyer or accountant even though he is on notice that the corporation<br>
is being mismanaged — taken together, these acts amount to recklessness,<br>
and thus justify holding D liable for losses suffered by the corporation<br>
that could have been prevented by a director who exercised reasonable<br>
care. [Francis v. United Jersey Bank].)<br>
<p>
This means that as a director, with a decent lawyer, you're pretty much<br>
safe from liability in all but the most extreme cases. So with our<br>
airline CEO, he'll probably look bad, but that's about it. That's not to<br>
say that the airline itself can't be held liable (a whole 'nother<br>
story).<br>
<p>
There's also this cute little "business judgment rule" which saves many<br>
actions from being held to be violations of the duty of due care. The<br>
business judgment rule basically provides that a substantively-unwise<br>
decision by a director or officer will not by itself constitute a lack<br>
of due care. If the director or officer has no "interest" in the<br>
transaction, has made an "informed" decision, and "rationally believed"<br>
this decision was in the corporation's best interest, he will be<br>
protected by the business judgement rule. So the decision does not have<br>
to be substantively "reasonable," but it must be at least "rational"<br>
(i.e., not totally crazy).<br>
<p>
As a practical matter, people choose to bother with the time and expense<br>
of chartering a full-blown corporate entity where (1) the owners want to<br>
limit their liability; (2) where free transferability of interests is<br>
important; (3) where centralized management is important (e.g., a large<br>
number of owners); and (4) where continuity of existence in the face of<br>
withdrawal or death of an owner is important. If these do not apply, by<br>
all means go with a partnership when (1) simplicity and inexpensiveness<br>
of creating and operating the enterprise are important; or (2) the tax<br>
advantages are significant, such as avoiding double taxation and/or<br>
sheltering other income.<br>
<p>
My conclusory point on this is that without settled law, corporations<br>
cannot exist.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I find the "accountability" argument against the existence of corporations</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be poor. &lt;snip&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Me too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In civil cases, it makes no legal or logical sense to sue the employees of</i><br>
<i>&gt; a company whose individual responsibilities are not justification for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; civil suite.  Many corporate civil suites are generated by situations that</i><br>
<i>&gt; are an accumulation of actions and decisions by hundreds of people that</i><br>
<i>&gt; were correct in their local context but not correct in the organizational</i><br>
<i>&gt; context.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly. This is why corporations are given a legal "identity" with<br>
rights and responsibilities under law. The sum total of the collective<br>
activity is embodied in this legal fiction to make it safer for<br>
businesspeople to transact, and easier for tortfeasors to collect. I<br>
don't see much of a problem with the philosophy behind it.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;snip&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (*NOTE: by</i><br>
<i>&gt; legal definition of a corporate stockholder you are NOT ALLOWED to have</i><br>
<i>&gt; direct control unless you are also an employee*).</i><br>
<p>
Right. Your powers as a shareholder are limited to electing and removing<br>
directors, amending the articles of incorporation or the bylaws, and<br>
voting rights on fundamental changes not in the ordinary course of<br>
business (e.g., mergers, sales of substantially all of the company's<br>
assets, or dissolution).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The corporate liability</i><br>
<i>&gt; exists so that an entity can be held responsible when no individual clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; is.</i><br>
<p>
Bingo!<br>
