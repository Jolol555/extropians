One of the interesting things about the history of thermodynamics<br>
is the way the English word "heat" was revealed to be devoid of<br>
meaning.  "Heat" turns out to map loosely to temperature, to<br>
conductive energy flow, and to stored thermal energy. The traditional<br>
English word does not map precisely to any of these things. In<br>
modern scientific usage, "heat" serves as a taxonomic word, referring<br>
to phenomena of interest to thermodynamicists without referring to<br>
any particular one thing. (In non-scientific usage, it continues<br>
more or less to refer to the fictitious caloric, just as some --<br>
not all -- modern non-scientific astronomical talk makes use of<br>
the Ptolemaic model.)<br>
<p>
I suspect that a similar disintegration is happening to the word<br>
"complexity". Although it is now clear to us that "heat" has no<br>
referent, and that the real measurable thermodynamic quantities<br>
are several different things, each of which has its own technical<br>
name, things were not so clear in the nineteenth century when<br>
the hard work was being done in laying the foundations of<br>
thermodynamics.<br>
<p>
All the really good discussions of "complexity" I've seen on this<br>
list seem to point toward a developing taxonomy of different types<br>
of complexity. There are several different competing definitions,<br>
and like the three definitions of "heat" they may all be right.<br>
That means each one of them will need a name of its own, so we can<br>
stop inadvertently confusing them, and if we can't agree which one<br>
is the "real" complexity, it may very well turn out that complexity<br>
is as chimerical as caloric, a half-baked idea that has played its<br>
role in the history of science to date, but, turning out to have<br>
no referent, must now be discarded.<br>
<p>
I'm presenting this discussion from the perspective of some readings<br>
in analytical philosophy, as applied to the history of science,<br>
and I'd be delighted to have my perspective broadened by a<br>
mathematician specializing in the study of complexity. Or by<br>
anyone else, for that matter.<br>
<p>
The only definition of complexity I can bring to mind at the<br>
moment is the one that I think is used in algorithmic<br>
information theory, which is the length (in bits) of the code<br>
needed to produce the full string. This definition allows all<br>
sorts of lossless compression to be applied to a given<br>
bit-string to squeeze out redundancies that, properly speaking,<br>
shouldn't count toward complexity. I can think of worse<br>
definitions, but this AIT definition has mismatches with<br>
"ordinary usage" of the word "complexity" as well. Before<br>
delving into these, I'd like to see what alternative<br>
definitions people have to suggest. I know John K Clark<br>
recently put forth several alternative definitions, with<br>
criticisms, and it was his post that triggered the thoughts<br>
that led up to my writing this.<br>
