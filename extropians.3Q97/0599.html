Yes, but at the same time it is extremely hard to write well about a<br>
society where almost everything is different from the present - the<br>
economics, daily life, ideology, technology and sociology. So it is<br>
understandable that many authors try to avoid it. <br>

Yes, it is a quite nice book. Phil Goetz called it "New York<br>
Transhumanism" and I think it fits; it is a static but very nice<br>
(mostly) society, but honestly I don't think it is very stable (the<br>
basic assumption was the utter incorruptibility of the aristoi, which<br>
doesn't seem very likely even given this technological level and<br>
sophistication). It demonstrates several technologies I think we<br>
should try to develop, but maybe not a society we should strive for. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I...personally...think it will destroy governments as a concept...and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; society of self-reliant individualists will emerge like a butterfly from a</i><br>
<i>&gt; cocoon...</i><br>
<p>
What we seek is not the overthrow of the government but a situation<br>
in which it gets lost in the shuffle.<br>

Personally I think we will be surprised. The new society that I'm<br>
sure will emerge will likely be something utterly different from what<br>
we expect and hope for. <br>
