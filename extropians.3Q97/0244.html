In a message dated 97-07-09 06:35:24 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I can't help being amused by all of This UFO bussines. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Me too.  But puzzeled too.<br>
<p>
Fact there are approximately 1.7 gazillion reported UFO sightings.....the<br>
gov. is trying it's best to downplay UFO's...even to the point of a Project<br>
BlueBook and the Condon (?) report.....and we ALLLLL trust the guv...don't<br>
we.<br>
<p>
You are exactly right about traversing the universe in such small craft....in<br>
fact traversing the universe at all....It's a BIG place....and I know of<br>
nothing that supports serious FTL travel....so generation ships are the only<br>
recourse.<br>
<p>
So...I have a theory...put forth for your examination.<br>
<p>
Referents:<br>
<p>
   Quantum theory....as I understand it when an electron changes<br>
"shells"...i.e. either gains or looses energy and movoes from one energy<br>
shell to another ....it does so without crossing the intervening<br>
space....just disappears and then reappears.  In some quarters the "Many<br>
Worlds" scenario is discussed with a straight face.<br>
<p>
   Dark Matter....as i understand it there is about 10 times less observable<br>
matter than would be expected from celestial mechanics calculation.<br>
<p>
    The speed limit of light appears inviolate.<br>
<p>
Super-String theory....as I understand it....presupposes more dimensions than<br>
the garden variety 3 that we are used to...4 if you consider time a<br>
dimension.<br>
<p>
<p>
Outrageous Speculation:<br>
    High energy particle physicist John Cramer wrote a book....TWISTOR....  in<br>
 which he speculates that the matter is there...but in a different<br>
(diminsion? don't like that term...but lack anything else) not interacting<br>
with the multitude of other dimensions (he speculates 7) by any means other<br>
than gravitational attraction.<br>
<p>
<p>
This opens up a number of possibilities....which I can't go into right<br>
now....gotta go.<br>
<p>
EvMick....leaving Knoxville.<br>
