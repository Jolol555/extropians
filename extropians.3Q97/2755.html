Being dedicated to the future progress of humankind <br>
should be the prime concern of all civilized beings. <br>

Dear Eric and other fellow Extropians,<br>
<p>
I tend to believe that the glass is half full.<br>
<p>
Despite the many seeming doubts of dear Eric (listed below in his<br>
responses), the universal quality, quantity and integrity of our education<br>
with intellectual self determination and self-actualization appears to be<br>
slowly increasing. As it increases, the ability of each individual to<br>
develop greater cross cultural knowedge, skills and abilities is enhanced.<br>
Ultimately, a new, expanded and enhanced paradigm is achieved which will<br>
allow and provide for the individual to understand the complexities of our<br>
society far more than they are currently capable of.<br>
At that point the degree of specialization which I refer to will be<br>
transcended into common understanding thereby providing for greater<br>
participation in our social and cultural structures.<br>
<p>
Enjoy!!!<br>

<i> &gt; The reality of the siuation is that numerous analysts collect as</i><br>
<i> &gt; many facts as possible prior to a policy proposal and jointly</i><br>
<i> &gt; present a summary and analysis to those who make the ultimate</i><br>
<i> &gt; determination. It should be pointed out that most policy is initiated</i><br>
<i> &gt; and instituted within the various agencies of government.  Only</i><br>
<i> &gt; where enabling legislation and appropriations are required does</i><br>
<i> &gt; the legislative branch become involved. Most policy determinations</i><br>
<i> &gt; (either domestic or foreign) are never noticed by the general</i><br>
<i> &gt; public.</i><br>
<p>
So are you telling us that the myth of democratic control of<br>
the government by the people, of responsible government, is<br>
just that, a myth?  Interesting.  I wonder how many more things<br>
we'll end up surprising one another by agreeing on.<br>
      <br>
<i> &gt; Possibly, through collective knowledge of the Extropians can we</i><br>
<i> &gt; evolve further so that a greater percentage of our citizenry can</i><br>
<i> &gt; develop the capacity to function on the broad and interdisciplinary</i><br>
<i> &gt; level required for participation in the further evolution of</i><br>
<i> &gt; humankind and its social and cultural structures.</i><br>
<p>
What if they have no interest in developing such capacity?  ("A<br>
greater percentage of our citizenry" that is, if the antecedent<br>
of "they" is not clear.)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; a far more succinct manner than I did. Obviously, I suspect that</i><br>
<i> &gt; the research that is required to understand the long effects of</i><br>
<i> &gt; any referendum or initiative is beyond the desire of most members</i><br>
<i> &gt; of the public and the media.</i><br>
<p>
I agree.  What is your opinion of the desire of most members of<br>
the public to choose their elected officials in an informed manner?<br>
These officials are in turn responsible for selecting the appointed<br>
officials who, as you say, actually generate the huge morass of<br>
legislation that is available to be utilized against inconvenient<br>
people.  Character issues are easily as complex (and fraught with<br>
deliberate deception, in many cases) as economic issues.<br>
