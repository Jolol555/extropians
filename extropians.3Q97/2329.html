Last December, there was a thread on this list called "Singularity-worship".<br>
<p>
It was Sandberg, I believe, who started it off, and said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Singularity concept has all the earmarks of an idea that can lead to</i><br>
<i>&gt; cultishness, and passivity.</i><br>
<p>
And I replied with words to this effect:<br>
<p>
"To me, the Singularity means that we don't need to worry about the far<br>
future; we can concentrate on the near-term stuff."<br>
<p>
It struck me as being truly fantastic that someone could read about the<br>
Singularity and then sit back and wait for it.  The Singularity validated, not<br>
invalidated, our current efforts.<br>
<p>
Well, a professor I know read "Staring", liked it, and then said:  "Perhaps<br>
I'll retire, since everything I do is going to be obsoleted anyway."<br>
<p>
And I said:<br>
"But isn't what you're doing useful right now?  (Which it was, since he was<br>
working on more efficient chickens.)  Won't it help get to the Singularity by<br>
feeding more people?"<br>
<p>
And he said:<br>
"Hmmm, you're right.  Well, guess I won't retire then."<br>
<p>
With regards to this whole conversation,<br>
I can only express my feelings in one way:<br>
<p>
<p>
                 ????         ????        ????<br>
                ?    ?       ?    ?      ?    ?<br>
                    ?            ?           ?<br>
                   ?            ?           ?<br>
                   ?            ?           ?<br>
<p>
                   ?            ?           ?<br>
<p>
<p>
I can't really claim to understand what happened, or how to prevent it -<br>
but it looks like Sandberg was right; the "Singularity" CAN lead to passivity.<br>
 Insofar as there IS going to be a Singularity, cultish or not, does anyone<br>
have suggestions on how the concept could be presented so as to avoid a repeat<br>
of the above error?<br>
