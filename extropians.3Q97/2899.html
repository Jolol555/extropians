Could we have this in English please?<br>
<p>
: The person talking about hydrogen flammability limits was very likely<br>
: confusing hydrogen in oxygen limits with hydrogen in AIR limits... two<br>
: very different situations. Yes, flammability limits in OXYGEN are from 4.7<br>
: to 15 and 90 to 93.9<br>
<p>
Four limits?  Two ranges?  What do the numbers mean?<br>
<p>
: with detonation limits in between (15 to 90% by volume) [...]<br>
: The flammability limits of hydrogen in AIR are 4.0 to 18.2 and again above<br>
: detonation limits at from 58.9 to 75%  with the 18.2 to 58.9% by volume<br>
<p>
Oh, it's parts per hundred?  But which way does the ratio run?<br>
<p>
"It's so simple, so very simple, that only a child can do it." (TL)<br>
<p>
: zone between the detonation limits this is a fuel it has to burn to work.<br>
: Propane in use everywhere with hardly anyone objecting has DETONATION<br>
: limits from 2.1 to 9.5 in AIR! (would prefer to use hydrogen)<br>
