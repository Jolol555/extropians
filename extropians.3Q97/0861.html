I think its more a matter of psychology on the part of the personnel<br>
manager. I mean, what sort of person has a goal in life of becoming a<br>
director of human resources? I'll bet its someone who did poorly on an<br>
IQ test and enjoys jerking around the lives of people more skilled and<br>
intelligent than they are. Job applicants would therefore be smart to<br>
not mention their intelligence. I've also noticed this same phenomenon<br>
on the part of department heads. They never want to hire someone smarter<br>
than they are, unless they are that rare non-egotistical type...<br>
