<i>&gt;&gt; The whole debate of UFO's generally misses the important question, and The</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Question is not 'Have we been visited by an extraterrestrial civilization?'</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; but 'Why have we been visited by extraterrestrial civilizations?' </i><br>
<p>
Leaving aside the relativistic starship model, which hardly fits the<br>
alleged ensemble of strange phenomena, I've never understood why the<br>
default provenance of UFOs-as-artifacts  is thought to be an alien ET<br>
civilisation using some faster than light drive or wormhole.  Since any<br>
superluminal transport also requires time travel in some frames, it's more<br>
parsimonious to posit that these alleged craft are from a future Earth.  <br>
<p>
That's *why* the drivers look sort of Homo sap - they're our evolved and/or<br>
posthumanly morphed offspring.  And that's why you can't nab the buggers -<br>
any encounter sufficiently egregious to cause a lethal time loop (landing<br>
on the White House lawns to say hi and pass over the zero point energy<br>
equations) will either pinch out or be aborted by the meta-Time Patrol.<br>
Sightings by `trailer trash' and timid astronomers, or even anally-obsessed<br>
abductions, presumably have no long-term impact on the future history in<br>
question, and can clear themselves up by attenuation.  <br>
<p>
On the other hand, maybe they're visitors from adjacent Many Worlds<br>
cultures.  Since there are an infnite number of these (by hypothesis),<br>
there's plenty of sources and machine models.  If such craft break down, it<br>
might be harder to retrieve them to the home plenum.  But then you'd expect<br>
to see a far greater proportion of intelligent dinosaurs, etc.<br>
<p>
As for Roswell, and to be serious for a moment - my problem with the Mogul<br>
explanation is that nobody in the US defense establishment expected Soviet<br>
nuclear weappns success until the mid-fifties (or so I'm told by my brother<br>
Mick, the nuclear-movie specialist), so I can't see why they'd be running<br>
weapons detection apparatus in 1947.  Sure, there's always trial<br>
lead-time... but it sounds implausible to me.<br>
