     Your very use of phrases like "YOUR reality" pegs the issue precisely: <br>
     there is only one reality.  Period.<br>

     Rick Knight:<br>
     Well that's absolutist enough to whet my appetite to engage.  Is this <br>
     something proveable or disproveable with empirical evidence or is it <br>
     something you have *decided* you believe? <br>
     <br>
     Lee Daniel Crocker (new):<br>
     It would be very easy to disprove empirically: if I threw a baseball <br>
     at you, and you didn't duck and weren't bruised, I might be willing <br>
     to believe that your reality didn't include my baseball; if you and <br>
     I set up cameras with timers to record an eclipse, and we get <br>
     different photos, then I might believe our moons were different.  But <br>
     experiments like this have been performed every day for thousands of <br>
     years, and I have yet to see personally or see a credible report of <br>
     one failing.<br>
     <br>

     This is likely going to tick you off but I can't help but quote Rafiki <br>
     to Simba as he gazed into a reflective pool, "Look harder."<br>
     <br>
     And also, I won't be playing contact sports with you ANY time soon <br>
     &lt;G&gt;.<br>
     <br>
     I am of the mind we live in a world of tacit agreement as far as <br>
     objective reality and that represents the majority of thinking in <br>
     humanity.  (This came back as a very solid meme after a psychedelic <br>
     experience and I have not been inclined to reformulate it). I believe <br>
     (in the absence of first hand experience) there are people who have <br>
     defied what most of us take for granted as physically possible.  <br>
     However, I believe quite assuredly that solid moving objects can hurt <br>
     me.  The laws of physics would clearly forecast personal injury in <br>
     your baseball scenario.  Now, does the baseball hurt me because I <br>
     "believe" it will or because it just...will, absolutely...without a <br>
     doubt...100%?  "Highly likely" is all a reasonable scientific mind <br>
     should say and I fully embrace that.  <br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
