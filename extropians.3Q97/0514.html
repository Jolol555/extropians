I agree that with a liberal definition of "functional", social roles<br>
are also functional, and that with a liberal definition of "social"<br>
all functions serve some social goal at some level.  But while I may<br>
not have chosen ideal terms to denote it, isn't there a distinction<br>
here worth making?  If you grant this, please suggest better terms, or<br>
grant me the license to use my not-perfect terms.<br>
