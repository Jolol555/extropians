I've always had mixed feelings about jury nullification.  Jefferson was<br>
surely right that jury nullification is one final bulwark against tyranny,<br>
but on the other hand, few things can compare to the injustice that can be<br>
doled out by a jury gone wrong in contradiction to the law and the facts.<br>
 I'm especially guarded about the system we have in which 12 "average" people<br>
are asked to consider highly technical matters in complex commercial cases or<br>
cases in which scientific evidence plays a key role.  <br>
<p>
The jury system developed in an environment in which there really weren't any<br>
truly complex cases:Twelve average folks can surely determine as well as any<br>
judge whether John skewered Robert with his broadsword or whether Henry<br>
defrauded Jane out of her herd of sheep.  But when asked to consider whether<br>
security interests were perfected in thousands of lending transactions<br>
involving as many documents, or whether the DNA evidence raises a high enough<br>
statistical probability of guilt to support a murder conviction (hmmmm) . . .<br>
we sometimes see some pretty unjust results from juries of "laymen".<br>
 Consider that the crucial evidence in a modern case may involve technical<br>
issues about which experts who have invested years of their lives studying<br>
may disagree, and that a jury is asked to make a decision based on at most a<br>
few weeks of testimony.  Then consider that our jury selection rules will<br>
often result in the empaneling of the LEAST qualified set of people that can<br>
be selected . . .<br>
