Oops. So scrape together several Earth-size masses, and perform a <br>
sequence of slingshots, within a few hours of each other. For an average<br>
10 km/s, need 20 Earths. Some heating from tidal deformations.<br>

 I was imagining using mass drivers on the<br>

<p>
Yes, this adds integral(M*v^2/2) of energy, with M= bomb+intercepted mass,<br>
and v= relative intercept velocity.<br>
