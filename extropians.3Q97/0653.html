Check out www.nepenthes.com/Misc/nerdvalley.html this is an article from<br>
July '91 from GQ of all places which basically states that without<br>
psychedlics the computer industry would be no where near what it is today...<br>
it mentions Jobs, as well as the founder of Lotus and the developer of the<br>
good ol' altair (also founder of PC Magazine according to the article) I<br>
myself am going camping this weekend and plan on enjoying some fine San<br>
Pedro tea... but I'm nobody so that doesn't really back up the argument...<br>
so when we've reached our post human state I suppose us psychedlic users<br>
will have an acid program... kind of like an internal screen saver... hmm<br>
could be fun...<br>
