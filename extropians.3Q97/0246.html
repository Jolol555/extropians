   I have some questions about Free-Market Economics that I hope someone <br>
can answer.<br>
<p>
   I will start by saying that I agree completely that a “true” <br>
free-market economy would be ideal.  One that is competitive, open, and <br>
decentralized.  But is a market free, if a company becomes so powerful <br>
that it establishes a near-monopoly on a given market and in turn <br>
prevents competition and progress form occurring?  A good example now I <br>
believe is Microsoft.  If your answer is no, then what methods or “laws” <br>
would enable the market to remain free and competitive without large <br>
corporations controlling policy?  As an anarcho-libertarian I want to be <br>
free of any coercion, government or corporate.  How do we as extropians <br>
propose to enhance the potential of a “true” free-market taking hold?<br>
<p>

P.S. I hope you can forgive what may already be a basic question on this <br>
topic.<br>
