This from CNN today -- I forget exactly what the claims were, and they may<br>
differ from this in some details (time frame?), but I that think some<br>
people who are quick to call other people names just may have some snacking<br>
on their own words to do, especially if these guys are proven right....<br>

Continental shifts may have led to evolution explosion<br>

LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- One-half billion years ago, for reasons scientists have<br>
never clearly understood, there was an unprecedented burst of evolutionary<br>
activity, greater than any before or since.<br>
<p>
Now, researchers at the California Institute of Technology and the Oak<br>
Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee have a theory as to why<br>
that happened -- one which even they admit is radical.<br>
<p>
The theory, reported in Friday's issue of Science, is called "true polar<br>
wander."  These researchers say there was a massive shift and realignment<br>
of the Earth's continents over a 15-million-year period -- at a pace about<br>
10 times as swift as the shift of continents under way today.<br>
<p>
They theorize it could have been caused by polar land masses that made the<br>
spinning Earth too top- and bottom-heavy.<br>
<p>
And when the shift was over, land that used to be at the poles was at the<br>
Equator and vice versa.  North America shifted north from the Southern<br>
Hemisphere.<br>
<p>
If this shift took place, cold continents would have thawed and tropical<br>
continents would have cooled.  Similar upheavals would have taken place in<br>
the oceans.  And the ensuing environmental changes caused by all of this<br>
created the chaotic conditions needed for rapid evolution.<br>
<p>
"Something like 40 different major groups of animals make their first<br>
appearance during this time," says Joe Kirschvink, a professor of geology<br>
at Cal Tech. "It's an incredible bloom."<br>
<p>
This evolutionary period is known as the "Cambrian explosion" or "big bang."<br>
It was during this time that many multi-celled organisms emerged whose<br>
descendants, including human beings, populate the Earth today.<br>
<p>
However, this new theory is not universally accepted, with some scientists<br>
saying the evidence supporting it is scanty. But researchers at Cal Tech<br>
believe they can test the theory to see if, indeed, "true polar wander"<br>
may be responsible for life as we know it.<br>
