Personally, I would consider losing the "social interaction with other<br>
children" a great benefit of home schooling; many of the kids I met at<br>
school were little but vicious thugs. I think a lot of people who feel<br>
this is important are caught up in the myth of "childhood innocence". <br>
<p>
Didn't someone post some research results to the list a year or two ago<br>
showing that children who spend time with adults generally do better than<br>
those who spend their time with other kids? This wouldn't seem terribly<br>
surprising, since adults tend to know a lot more than kids. Worked for me,<br>
anyway. <br>
